## Question

How does CIDP differ from Guillain-Barr syndrome?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) differs from Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about temporal evolution and how that anchors diagnosis. Then, I should verify clinical features that distinguish the two, including patterns of weakness, reflexes, and cranial/autonomic involvement. Next, I will examine pathophysiology and immune mechanisms. After that, I need to check electrophysiology and ancillary tests, including CSF and neurofilament light chain. I will then review diagnostic criteria and pitfalls, especially acute-onset CIDP versus treatment-related fluctuations in GBS. Finally, I will consider treatment principles and prognostic distinctions, and synthesize the key differentiators into a practical framework for clinicians.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental distinction in time course, because this is the anchor for classification and often the most reliable single differentiator. GBS reaches its nadir within 4 weeks, whereas CIDP progresses beyond 8 weeks or follows a relapsing course; however, I need to remember the recognized acute-onset CIDP (A-CIDP) variant that can mimic GBS early but declares itself over time, so I should not jump to conclusions at presentation if the trajectory is still evolving [^116Xe7RN] [^115KWqxX] [^117ESgyL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the time thresholds alone; I should verify the specific early-differentiation signals that push me toward A-CIDP rather than GBS with treatment-related fluctuation (TRF). Three or more fluctuations, or new deterioration after 8 weeks from onset, make A-CIDP more likely than TRF, and this matters because TRF often responds to repeating the acute therapy whereas A-CIDP usually needs long-term maintenance immunotherapy; I should double-check that this aligns with guideline-based cautions and prospective data showing A-CIDP patients are often less severely affected at each timepoint than those with TRF [^113LDiZC] [^112exJMa] [^116Xe7RN].

> Next, I should review the clinical phenotype. Both are typically symmetric, but CIDP more often shows proximal and distal weakness and a slower evolution with absent or reduced reflexes, while GBS often presents with rapid, ascending, symmetric weakness and universal areflexia by the time it plateaus; cranial nerve involvement and autonomic dysfunction are common in GBS and can be severe, whereas they are less prominent in typical CIDP, although I need to be cautious because A-CIDP and autoimmune nodopathies can mimic GBS closely early on [^115KWqxX] [^115K43en].

> I will now examine pathophysiology and triggers. GBS is classically post-infectious, with Campylobacter jejuni frequently implicated and molecular mimicry targeting gangliosides contributing to axonal forms; this mechanistic link helps explain its acute, monophasic nature, though I should confirm that antecedent infections can rarely precede CIDP as well, especially in younger patients or those with acute-onset presentations [^112n6aLp] [^115XFR8Z].

> Wait, let me verify the immunologic substrate in CIDP. CIDP is driven by immune-mediated demyelination with both cellular and humoral arms, and a meaningful subset demonstrate antibodies to nodal/paranodal proteins such as NF155, Contactin-1, Caspr1, and NF186, defining autoimmune nodopathies that often show poor or partial response to IVIG and better responses to anti-CD20 therapy; this subgroup blurs the traditional demyelinating/axonal dichotomy because conduction failure can occur without classic macrophage-mediated demyelination [^112K9U7D] [^114TNU71] [^111JUQDK].

> Let me consider electrophysiology next, and I should double-check the diagnostic thresholds. CIDP requires demyelinating features on nerve conduction studies, often including conduction block, temporal dispersion, prolonged distal latencies, and reduced conduction velocities, and EAN/PNS 2021 notes that a single-nerve abnormality can be supportive if interpreted carefully; GBS can show demyelinating or axonal patterns early, with the caveat that early conduction changes may reflect reversible conduction failure rather than fixed demyelination, and serial studies can help clarify the trajectory and avoid mislabeling AIDP as CIDP when abnormalities persist [^115drZ3S] [^112Mb2m9] [^116BtnQ6].

> I need to check ancillary tests and biomarkers. CSF albuminocytologic dissociation supports either diagnosis, but persistent or very high protein levels are more suggestive of CIDP; I initially thought " > 100 mg/dL", but wait, I should verify — EAN/PNS emphasizes markedly elevated CSF protein as supportive in CIDP without a rigid cutoff, and it also recommends testing for nodal/paranodal antibodies in suspected CIDP or A-CIDP, particularly when response to IVIG is suboptimal; neurofilament light chain tends to be higher in GBS acutely and may aid prognostication, though it is not yet a diagnostic biomarker to distinguish GBS from CIDP reliably [^112K9U7D] [^115KWqxX] [^113tJVQc].

> Hold on, I should verify the imaging adjuncts that help when the picture is murky. Nerve ultrasound can show multifocal nerve enlargement that persists in CIDP, whereas in GBS the enlargement is often more restricted to roots and vagus early and tends to normalize over months; a "sensory-sparing" ultrasound pattern with enlarged roots/vagus but spared sensory nerves favors GBS over CIDP in early differentiation, but I need to ensure this is interpreted in clinical context and with longitudinal correlation [^112rzjoe].

> Next, I should review diagnostic criteria and pitfalls, and I need to ensure I am using the most recent frameworks. The EAN/PNS GBS and CIDP criteria provide structured clinical, electrophysiologic, and supportive features to increase diagnostic confidence, but underdiagnosis of CIDP remains common and many patients are initially labeled as GBS; in particular, I should confirm that persistent symptoms beyond 8 weeks, repeated fluctuations, or relapse warrant reconsideration of A-CIDP and prompt initiation of CIDP-directed long-term therapy rather than repeated acute GBS regimens [^111AaP9F] [^112K9U7D] [^115KWqxX].

> I will now examine treatment principles and the consequences of misclassification. For GBS, early IVIG or plasma exchange within the first 2 weeks is standard, and repeating therapy is reasonable for TRF; by contrast, CIDP is steroid-responsive and generally requires long-term maintenance with IVIG, corticosteroids, or SCIG, with periodic reassessment and dose optimization; I should double-check that steroids are not recommended in GBS because they do not help and may worsen outcomes, which is a critical therapeutic fork in the road [^115KWqxX] [^113sJYvE] [^11691M1U] [^111LbmUx].

> Let me think about prognosis and longitudinal trajectories, and I should verify how they differ. GBS often improves substantially over months, but severe cases may have long-term deficits; CIDP carries a chronic course with relapse risk and treatment dependence, and early recognition and sustained immunotherapy reduce the risk of irreversible axonal loss and disability; this underscores why timely reclassification from GBS to A-CIDP can change outcomes if made before fixed injury accrues [^112n6aLp] [^115K43en].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or antibody-defined. Autoimmune nodopathies can present acutely with cranial, respiratory, and autonomic involvement and often respond poorly to IVIG or steroids, favoring early rituximab; recognizing this subgroup early avoids futile repetition of acute GBS protocols and pivots therapy toward B-cell depletion, so I should confirm antibody testing when the course is refractory or the phenotype suggests nodal/paranodal autoimmunity [^112K9U7D] [^111JUQDK].

> Let me synthesize the key differentiators into a practical clinical framework. Temporal evolution remains the most reliable anchor: GBS reaches nadir within 4 weeks and is typically monophasic, whereas CIDP progresses beyond 8 weeks or relapses; clinical severity with cranial and autonomic involvement favors GBS, while proximal weakness and a relapsing course favor CIDP; demyelinating electrophysiology supports CIDP, but early GBS can show reversible conduction failure that mimics demyelination; persistent or very high CSF protein, nodal/paranodal antibodies, and persistent nerve enlargement on ultrasound support CIDP; and treatment responsiveness to steroids and the need for maintenance therapy strongly support CIDP over GBS [^116Xe7RN] [^115KWqxX] [^115drZ3S] [^112K9U7D] [^112rzjoe] [^111LbmUx].

> Finally, I should double-check the practical takeaways to avoid common errors. If a patient with presumed GBS worsens again after 8 weeks or has three or more fluctuations, I should reconsider A-CIDP and initiate CIDP-directed long-term therapy; if a patient with presumed CIDP fails IVIG, I should test for nodal/paranodal antibodies and consider early anti-CD20 therapy; and if electrophysiology shows persistent demyelinating changes months after an apparent AIDP, I must interpret this in clinical context because persistent abnormalities alone do not prove CIDP without the supportive clinical course [^113LDiZC] [^112K9U7D] [^113kfs56].

CIDP and GBS are both immune-mediated demyelinating neuropathies, but they differ in **time course** and **treatment response**. GBS is **acute and monophasic**, reaching nadir within 4 weeks [^112E8A7i] and often triggered by infection [^112n6aLp]; it responds to IVIG or plasma exchange [^115KWqxX] but not corticosteroids [^115KWqxX]. CIDP is **chronic and relapsing**, progressing over more than 8 weeks [^115K43en] and is steroid-responsive [^115K43en]; it requires long-term immunotherapy [^111D8e1H] to prevent relapse. Accurate differentiation is essential because **steroids help CIDP but not GBS** [^116Xe7RN], and misdiagnosis delays appropriate therapy [^111mV1o3].

| **Feature** | **Gbs** | **Cidp** |
|-|-|-|
| Time course | Acute (< 4 weeks) [^112E8A7i] | Chronic (> 8 weeks) [^115K43en] |
| Clinical course | Monophasic | Relapsing-remitting or progressive [^115K43en] |
| Triggers | Often post-infectious [^112n6aLp] | Rarely post-infectious [^115XFR8Z] |
| Treatment response | IVIG or plasma exchange [^115KWqxX] | Steroids, IVIG, plasma exchange [^115K43en] |
| Prognosis | Generally self-limited [^111Jtb6C] | Chronic, relapsing [^115K43en] |

### New chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy / Guillain-Barrésyndrome guidelines-impact on clinical practise [^111AaP9F]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There is no diagnostic biomarker that can reliably detect Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Diagnosis relies upon integrating key clinical characteristics and relevant supportive data. Consequently, misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis are common. Diagnostic criteria have proven valuable resources to improve diagnosis, but are underutilized during routine clinical care.

Recent Findings

In 2021, the EAN/PNS CIDP criteria was published, and were followed by the EAN/PNS GBS criteria in 2023. Both guidelines utilized GRADE methodology to formulate evidence-based recommendations that are intended to be used by adult and paediatric clinicians across diverse care settings to optimize diagnostic accuracy and improve patient outcomes during routine clinical care.

Summary

The EAN/PNS GBS and CIDP criteria detail specific clinical, electrophysiological, and laboratory features that raise diagnostic confidence, and call attention to diagnostic mimics. The sensitivity of EAN/PNS and other modern criteria to detect GBS and CIDP is high, but utilization during clinical practice is low. Complexity is one factor limiting widespread application. Strategies are needed to optimize criteria adoption during routine clinical care such that GBS and CIDP diagnosis can be achieved with greater speed and accuracy.

Guillain-Barré syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy are autoimmune-mediated inflammatory diseases of the PNS. In recent years, substantial progress has been made towards understanding the immune mechanisms that underlie these conditions, in large part through the study of experimental models. Here, we review the available animal models that partially mimic human Guillain-Barré syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and discuss the wide range of therapeutic approaches that have been successfully established in these models of inflammatory neuropathies. Transfer of this preclinical knowledge to patients has been far less successful, and inflammatory neuropathies are still associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We will summarize successful therapeutic trials in human autoimmune neuropathies to provide a vantage point for the transfer of experimental treatment strategies to clinical practice in immune-mediated diseases of the peripheral nerve.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome [^116pycXD]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome is the most common and most severe acute paralytic neuropathy, with about 100,000 people developing the disorder every year worldwide. Under the umbrella term of Guillain-Barré syndrome are several recognisable variants with distinct clinical and pathological features. The severe, generalised manifestation of Guillain-Barré syndrome with respiratory failure affects 20–30% of cases. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange is the optimal management approach, alongside supportive care. Understanding of the infectious triggers and immunological and pathological mechanisms has advanced substantially in the past 10 years, and is guiding clinical trials investigating new treatments. Investigators of large, worldwide, collaborative studies of the spectrum of Guillain-Barré syndrome are accruing data for clinical and biological databases to inform the development of outcome predictors and disease biomarkers. Such studies are transforming the clinical and scientific landscape of acute autoimmune neuropathies.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome: pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis [^112n6aLp]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a potentially life-threatening postinfectious disease characterized by rapidly progressive, symmetrical weakness of the extremities. About 25% of patients develop respiratory insufficiency and many show signs of autonomic dysfunction. Diagnosis can usually be made on clinical grounds, but lumbar puncture and electrophysiological studies can help to substantiate the diagnosis and to differentiate demyelinating from axonal subtypes of GBS. Molecular mimicry of pathogen-borne antigens, leading to generation of crossreactive antibodies that also target gangliosides, is part of the pathogenesis of GBS; the subtype and severity of the syndrome are partly determined by the nature of the antecedent infection and specificity of such antibodies. Intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange are proven effective treatments but many patients have considerable residual deficits. Discrimination of patients with treatment-related fluctuations from those with acute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy is important, as these conditions may require different treatments. Novel prognostic models can accurately predict outcome and the need for artificial ventilation, which could aid the selection of patients with a poor prognosis for more-individualized care. This Review summarizes the clinical features of and diagnostic criteria for GBS, and discusses its pathogenesis, treatment and prognosis.

### Peripheral nerve proteins as potential autoantigens in acute and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies [^112U4CMC]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome is classified into acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and acute motor axonal neuropathy. Whereas autoantibodies to GM1 or GD1a induce the development of acute motor axonal neuropathy, pathogenic autoantibodies have yet to be identified in acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. This review highlights the importance of autoantibodies to peripheral nerve proteins in the physiopathology of acute and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies. Moreover, we listed up other potential antigens, which may become helpful biomarkers for acquired, dysimmune demyelinating neuropathies based on their critical functions during myelination and their implications in hereditary demyelinating neuropathies.

### Novel immunological and therapeutic insights in Guillain-Barrésyndrome and CIDP [^115vtb6U]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory neuropathies are a heterogeneous group of rare diseases of the peripheral nervous system that include acute and chronic diseases, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). The etiology and pathophysiological mechanisms of inflammatory neuropathies are only partly known, but are considered autoimmune disorders in which an aberrant immune response, including cellular and humoral components, is directed towards components of the peripheral nerve causing demyelination and axonal damage. Therapy of these disorders includes broad-spectrum immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive treatments, such as intravenous immunoglobulin, corticosteroids, or plasma exchange. However, a significant proportion of patients do not respond to any of these therapies, and treatment selection is not optimized according to disease pathophysiology. Therefore, research on disease pathophysiology aiming to reveal clinically and functionally relevant disease mechanisms and the development of new treatment approaches are needed to optimize disease outcomes in CIDP and GBS. This topical review describes immunological progress that may help guide therapeutic strategies in the future in these two disorders.

The authors report five patients with inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy with a Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)-like onset and initial clinical features, but with persistent symptoms similar to chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Patients in the chronic phase improved with corticosteroid or IV immunoglobulin therapy. Patients with apparent GBS who show persistent symptoms may benefit from corticosteroids or other treatment that is beneficial in the management of CIDP.

### Patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy initially diagnosed as Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^115L5uGY]. Journal of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Progression periods for Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) differ from those of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), but physicians could classify patients with CIDP within 4 weeks of onset as GBS. We studied and report the frequency of GBS patients who were later diagnosed as CIDP (11/663, 2%). Plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin transiently improved all the 11 patients, who 11 progressed slowly or had a relapse beyond the 8 weeks, and the other 2 suffered a relapse between 4 and 8 weeks from the onset. Three patients had had an antecedent infectious illness. CSF albumino-cytological dissociation was detected in 6 patients within 2 weeks of onset. Recognition of the existence of such patients is important for the early diagnosis and treatment of those patients with CIDP for whom GBS has been diagnosed at onset.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, more specifically with respect to laboratory tests, EAN/PNS 2021 guidelines recommend to consider testing for nodal and paranodal antibodies in patients with clinically suspected CIDP and any of the following features if nodal and paranodal (anti-neurofascin 155, anti-contactin 1, anti-Caspr1) and possibly anti-neurofascin 140/186 antibody testing is available and meets quality standards:

- resistance to standard therapy with IVIG and corticosteroids

- acute or subacute aggressive onset, previous diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome or acute-onset CIDP

- low-frequency tremor, ataxia disproportionate to sensory involvement or other cerebellar features, predominantly distal weakness

- respiratory failure and cranial nerve involvement

- associated nephrotic syndrome

- very high CSF protein levels.

### Immunotherapy in peripheral neuropathies [^111zXnpY]. Neurotherapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Immunotherapy has been investigated in a small subset of peripheral neuropathies, including an acute one, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and 3 chronic forms: chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, multifocal motor neuropathy, and neuropathy associated with IgM anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein. Several experimental studies and clinical data are strongly suggestive of an immune-mediated pathogenesis. Either cell-mediated mechanisms or antibody responses to Schwann cell, compact myelin, or nodal antigens are considered to act together in an aberrant immune response to cause damage to peripheral nerves. Immunomodulatory treatments used in these neuropathies aim to act at various steps of this pathogenic process. However, there are many phenotypic variants and, consequently, there is a significant difference in the response to immunotherapy between these neuropathies, as well as a need to improve our knowledge and long-term management of chronic forms.

### Immune-mediated neuropathies [^112nj4Ly]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Since the discovery of an acute monophasic paralysis, later coined Guillain-Barré syndrome, almost 100 years ago, and the discovery of chronic, steroid-responsive polyneuropathy 50 years ago, the spectrum of immune-mediated polyneuropathies has broadened, with various subtypes continuing to be identified, including chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). In general, these disorders are speculated to be caused by autoimmunity to proteins located at the node of Ranvier or components of myelin of peripheral nerves, although disease-associated autoantibodies have not been identified for all disorders. Owing to the numerous subtypes of the immune-mediated neuropathies, making the right diagnosis in daily clinical practice is complicated. Moreover, treating these disorders, particularly their chronic variants, such as CIDP and MMN, poses a challenge. In general, management of these disorders includes immunotherapies, such as corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange. Improvements in clinical criteria and the emergence of more disease-specific immunotherapies should broaden the therapeutic options for these disabling diseases.

### Acute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy: an electrodiagnostic study [^114JSLkE]. Muscle & Nerve (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (A-CIDP) is an increasingly recognized CIDP subtype. Differentiating A-CIDP from Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is challenging but important, because there are different treatment outcomes.

Methods

We report 3 patients with A-CIDP who were initially diagnosed with severe GBS but were later confirmed to have CIDP based on their clinical course and electrodiagnostic (EDx) studies. We also report on the long-term treatment of these patients and review the literature on EDx studies in this syndrome.

Results

Three patients were initially diagnosed with GBS and responded to treatment. However, all 3 had arrest in improvement or deterioration during their rehabilitation phases. EDx studies showed prominent demyelinating changes many months after the initial presentation. All responded very well to immunotherapy.

Conclusion

Although several features may suggest the diagnosis of A-CIDP at initial presentation, close follow-up of GBS patients during the recovery phase is also needed for accurate diagnosis. EDx studies may distinguish patients with A-CIDP from GBS patients.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin for inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy [^113WCyTU]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) plays a key role in treatment of inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies such as Guillain–Barre syndrome (GBS). However, individual response to treatment can be unpredictable, and for those most severely affected, a second dose of IVIg (SIV) is commonly administered despite limited evidence for efficacy. In this month's journal club, we review two studies which explore the efficacy of second dosing and a third study exploring neurophysiological factors predicting relapse in chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome: a comprehensive review [^113AwJ9t]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Guillain‐Barré syndrome is a postinfectious, immune‐mediated peripheral neuropathy. As our knowledge continues to expand, its pathophysiological mechanisms remain partially understood and many questions are yet to be answered. The focus of care should remain early diagnosis and treatment, to prevent severe axonal damage and minimise long‐term disability. Meanwhile, novel therapies and neuropathy fluid biomarkers are under ongoing evaluation and may improve clinical management in the foreseeable future.

### Therapy of immune neuropathies with intravenous immunoglobulins [^113uMM2B]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Autoimmune-mediated disorders belong to the main causes of neuropathies worldwide. During recent years much progress has been achieved in the understanding of the underlying pathomechanisms, associated with implications for therapeutic approaches. Here we will briefly review the pathogenesis and discuss treatment options of the Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, multifocal motor neuropathy, and neuropathies associated with paraproteinemias. In most of these disease entities intravenous immunoglobulins play a major role as effective and safe treatment options.

### Controversies in the diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy [^1113MEUc]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is an immune-mediated disorder of the peripheral nervous system characterized by progressive or relapsing motor and sensory dysfunction. First described several decades ago, CIDP has since been the focus of extensive clinical and research attention. Yet, despite its long-standing recognition, significant controversies persist − particularly regarding its diagnosis. These challenges stem from the clinical and electrophysiological heterogeneity of the disease, the overlap with other neuropathies, and evolving diagnostic criteria. This review will focus on three of the most debated controversies in CIDP, aiming to clarify current perspectives and highlight areas of ongoing uncertainty.

Immune mediated neuropathies are uncommon but important to diagnose because they are potentially treatable. This chapter summarizes the clinical approach to diagnosis of Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), and related neuropathies which are thought to be caused by direct autoimmune attack on peripheral nerves.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome [^111B7Txb]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

The term Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), the most frequent cause of acute paralytic neuropathy, covers a number of recognisably distinct variants. The exact cause of GBS is unknown, but 50–70% of cases appear 1–2weeks after a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection, or another immune stimulus that induces an aberrant autoimmune response targeting peripheral nerves and their spinal roots. The interplay between the microbial and host factors that dictate whether and how the immune response shifts towards autoreactivity is still unclear, and nothing is known about the genetic and environmental factors that affect an individual's susceptibility to the disease. All patients with GBS need meticulous monitoring, and can benefit from supportive care and the early start of specific treatment. This review summarises the clinical features and diagnostic criteria of GBS and proposes an algorithm for its management. An analysis of the literature showed that, about one century after it was first described, new information concerning its etiopathogenesis has allowed the development of new treatment strategies that should be started immediately after diagnosis; however, the available therapies are not sufficient in many patients, especially in the presence of the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. New post-infectious forms, such as those caused by Zika virus and enterovirus D68, need to be carefully analysed and, in order to improve patient outcomes, research should continue to aim at identifying new biomarkers of disease severity and better means of avoiding axonal injury.

### Advances in understanding and treatment of immune-mediated disorders of the peripheral nervous system [^113XWb8z]. Muscle & Nerve (2004). Low credibility.

During recent years, novel insights in basic immunology and advances in biotechnology have contributed to an increased understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of immune-mediated disorders of the peripheral nervous system. This increased knowledge has an impact on the management of patients with this class of disorders. Current advances are outlined and their implication for therapeutic approaches addressed. As a prototypic immune-mediated neuropathy, special emphasis is placed on the pathogenesis and treatment of the Guillain-Barré syndrome and its variants. Moreover, neuropathies of the chronic inflammatory demyelinating, multifocal motor, and nonsystemic vasculitic types are discussed.

### Treatment of immune neuropathies [^1133ztQY]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose Of The Review

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating poly(radiculo)neuropathy (CIDP) and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) are potentially treatable disorders. The use of appropriate assessment scales to evaluate the effects of treatment is essential. Recent therapeutic trials and the question of whether patients with mild disease or other variants of these disorders need to be treated are discussed.

Recent Findings

Recent clinical trials and Cochrane reviews give new information on the effect of various treatments in patients with GBS, CIDP and MMN. Intravenous immunoglobulin remains the only treatment proven to be effective in MMN. Combinations of treatment may be even more effective in GBS. Studies on prognostic factors related to improvement have been reported. Whether patients with Miller-Fisher syndrome or those with mild GBS should also be treated is still debated. New assessment scales at the disability and handicap level have now been evaluated for GBS and CIDP, and are ready for use. Results of studies in experimental models contribute to our understanding of the mechanism of action of intravenous immunoglobulin.

Summary

Recent new information on the use of intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids indicates that the former should remain the cornerstone of treatment for GBS and MMN, and probably also for CIDP. Whether steroids not only suppress disease activity in CIDP but also eradicate the disease remains to be established. Some GBS patients have secondary deterioration or finally turn out to have CIDP; additional information in this group of patients may lead to more appropriate disease management. Most patients with CIDP and those with MMN need long-term treatment. New treatment strategies should now focus also on the effect and the costs of treatment over long-term follow up.

### Inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy after the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine may follow a chronic course [^114Jn4vE]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Rare autoimmune neurological events have been reported during the ongoing global drive for mass vaccination as a means of controlling the Covid-19 pandemic. Guillain-Barré syndrome, an acute inflammatory neuropathy well recognised as a rare complication of influenza vaccination, has been reported to follow administration of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca) vaccine.

Methods

We report four patients with inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy after vaccination in whom a relapsing or progressive course indicated the development of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP).

Conclusions

Awareness of this complication and distinction from Guillain-Barré syndrome enables the timely institution of maintenance immunomodulatory treatment. Our report also highlights the likely relationship between vaccination and the subsequent development of CIDP, but definitive demonstration of a causal link needs larger studies.

### Interleukin 8, a biomarker to differentiate Guillain-Barrésyndrome from CIDP [^117ESgyL]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) are heterogeneous neuropathic diseases caused by an immune-mediated inflammatory process, with different temporal evolution. In GBS, symptoms develop over 4 weeks before reaching a steady state, whereas CIDP has continuous clinical worsening for more than 8 weeks. Although CIDP usually has progressive onset, a study reported that 16% of patients with CIDP have acute symptoms with a nadir within 8 weeks from the onset of disease, followed by a chronic course. These patients were defined as acute-onset CIDP.

Both GBS and CIDP diagnostic strategies rely on clinical, electroneuromyography (ENMG), and CSF findings, namely albuminocytologic dissociation. Although CIDP differs from GBS in its time course, disease duration, prognosis, and steroid responsiveness, no specific biomarker exists in both blood and CSF to distinguish these 2 diseases. Nevertheless, 2 cytokine screening–based studies — with a limited number of patients — have shown a trend of CSF interleukin 8 (IL-8) elevation in GBS more than in CIDP. IL-8 is a proinflammatory chemokine primarily secreted by circulating monocytes and local macrophages. It plays a crucial role in the inflammatory cascade by inducing chemotaxis gradient, migration, and oxidative burst.

In practice, although GBS and CIDP are usually distinguishable in most of the cases, overlapping clinical and paraclinical features may occur, especially when CIDP begins with acute onset, which can mimic GBS at early stages. This study aims to evaluate the potential use of CSF IL-8 as a biomarker to help to differentiate GBS and CIDP at disease onset.

### Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy [^114VqXzF]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

In chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy differing clinical subtypes are beginning to emerge as has already occurred with the Guillain-Barré syndrome. However, neither pathogenic correlates nor particular therapeutic approaches have yet been defined for these subgroups. The neurophysiological techniques of terminal latency index and of modified F ratio help differentiate chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy from IgM paraproteinaemic neuropathy. Diagnosis may be assisted by magnetic resonance imaging studies in which enlarged nerve roots and plexuses and gadolinium enhancement may be evident. Further insight into pathogenesis has come from studies showing pathogenic antibodies in a small percentage of patients. Immunohistological studies examining the presence of adhesion, co-stimulatory and antigen presenting molecules in nerve biopsies have shown that T cell activation can be initiated and perpetuated within nerve and that Schwann cells possess the necessary markers to function as antigen presenting cells. Recent clinical trials have confirmed the therapeutic short term efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin and Prednisone.

### Distinguishing acute-onset CIDP from fluctuating Guillain-Barre syndrome: a prospective study [^112exJMa]. Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to provide criteria that can help to distinguish between GBS-TRF and A-CIDP in the early phase of disease.

Background

The distinction between Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) with fluctuations shortly after start of treatment (treatment-related fluctuations, or GBS-TRF) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy with acute onset (A-CIDP) is difficult but important because prognosis and treatment strategy largely differ.

Methods

Patients with GBS (n = 170) were included in a prospective longitudinal study. Patients with GBS-TRF (n = 16) and patients with A-CIDP (n = 8) were analyzed and compared. Extended clinical data, biologic material, and electrophysiologic data were collected during 1 year follow-up.

Results

The first TRF in the GBS-TRF group always occurred within 8 weeks (median 18 days; range 10–54 days) from onset of weakness. In the GBS-TRF group, 5 (31%) patients had a second TRF and none had more TRFs. At all timepoints, patients in the A-CIDP group were less severely affected than patients with GBS-TRF, did not need artificial ventilation, rarely had cranial nerve dysfunction, and tended to have more CIDP-like electrophysiologic abnormalities. More GBS-TRF patients were severely affected and more patients had sensory disturbances when compared to the GBS group without fluctuations.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of acute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) should be considered when a patient thought to have Guillain-Barré syndrome deteriorates again after 8 weeks from onset or when deterioration occurs 3 times or more. Especially when the patient remains able to walk independently and has no cranial nerve dysfunction or electrophysiologic features likely to be compatible with CIDP, maintenance treatment for CIDP should be considered.

### European Academy of Neurology / Peripheral Nerve Society guideline on diagnosis and treatment of Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^115KWqxX]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute polyradiculoneuropathy. Symptoms may vary greatly in presentation and severity. Besides weakness and sensory disturbances, patients may have cranial nerve involvement, respiratory insufficiency, autonomic dysfunction and pain. To develop an evidence-based guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of GBS, using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology a Task Force (TF) of the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) and the Peripheral Nerve Society (PNS) constructed 14 Population/Intervention/Comparison/Outcome questions (PICOs) covering diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of GBS, which guided the literature search. Data were extracted and summarised in GRADE Summaries of Findings (for treatment PICOs) or Evidence Tables (for diagnostic and prognostic PICOs). Statements were prepared according to GRADE Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) frameworks. For the six intervention PICOs, evidence-based recommendations are made. For other PICOs, good practice points (GPPs) are formulated. For diagnosis, the principal GPPs are: GBS is more likely if there is a history of recent diarrhoea or respiratory infection; CSF examination is valuable, particularly when the diagnosis is less certain; electrodiagnostic testing is advised to support the diagnosis; testing for anti-ganglioside antibodies is of limited clinical value in most patients with typical motor-sensory GBS, but anti-GQ1b antibody testing should be considered when Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) is suspected; nodal-paranodal antibodies should be tested when autoimmune nodopathy is suspected; MRI or ultrasound imaging should be considered in atypical cases; and changing the diagnosis to acute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (A-CIDP) should be considered if progression continues after 8weeks from onset, which occurs in around 5% of patients initially diagnosed with GBS. For treatment, the TF recommends intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) 0.4g/kg for 5days, in patients within 2weeks (GPP also within 2–4weeks) after onset of weakness if unable to walk unaided, or a course of plasma exchange (PE) 12–15L in four to five exchanges over 1–2weeks, in patients within 4weeks after onset of weakness if unable to walk unaided. The TF recommends against a second IVIg course in GBS patients with a poor prognosis; recommends against using oral corticosteroids, and weakly recommends against using IV corticosteroids; does not recommend PE followed immediately by IVIg; weakly recommends gabapentinoids, tricyclic antidepressants or carbamazepine for treatment of pain; does not recommend a specific treatment for fatigue. To estimate the prognosis of individual patients, the TF advises using the modified Erasmus GBS outcome score (mEGOS) to assess outcome, and the modified Erasmus GBS Respiratory Insufficiency Score (mEGRIS) to assess the risk of requiring artificial ventilation. Based on the PICOs, available literature and additional discussions, we provide flow charts to assist making clinical decisions on diagnosis, treatment and the need for intensive care unit admission.

### Clinical features of Guillain-Barrésyndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuritis associated with SLE [^116UuDFQ]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, GBS and CIDP are rare but serious complications of SLE, which may manifest regardless of the systemic activity of the primary disease and may have various presentations. Clinical test features may differ from that of the pure form of GBS and CIDP, warranting further studies on how to distinguish them effectively. Treatment of SLE-related GBS and CIDP also differs from pure GBS and CIDP, often requiring immunosuppressants and corticosteroid pulse therapy, making differential diagnosis crucial for initiating treatment, especially for patients with GBS or CIDP presenting as the first manifestation of SLE.

Discussion

CIDP has a very heterogeneous presentation, and consists of a spectrum of autoimmune diseases of the peripheral nerves based on presumed breach of tolerance leading to autoimmunity against nerve antigens. Different pathophysiological mechanisms have been identified, often sharing clinical features, which makes diagnosis challenging.

The term CIDP was introduced in 1982 describing some of the most common features of the disease in four different domains, namely time of onset, pathophysiology, tissue component involved and anatomical distribution. However, the use of this term has evolved over time to try to incorporate other patients with primary chronic immune-mediated neuropathies susceptible to disease-modifying therapies that share but do not necessarily include all of the original features. More importantly, as our knowledge of the disease deepens, it has become increasingly difficult to unite all clinical presentations and pathophysiological mechanisms under this term, some even contradicting the original terminology. First, CIDP may have an acute onset, that initially resembles Guillain-Barré syndrome. Also, some neuropathies meet various supportive criteria, including treatment response, but not the electrophysiological criteria. However, the best examples are the recently discovered nodal and paranodal neuropathies that are caused by autoantibodies. Some are autoantibodies to axonal nodal structures, such as CNTN1, so that it became clear that autoimmunity can be primarily directed to axonal antigens, and not only to myelin antigens. In case of anti-CNTN1, electron microscopy examination showed a selective loss of the septate-like junctions at the paranodes and a detachment of the paranodal myelin loops from the axon, but there was an absence of inflammation and classical macrophage-induced demyelination. Importantly, this disorganization of the nodes of Ranvier disrupts the saltatory conduction, which leads to electrophysiological findings that are traditionally interpreted as demyelinating features. The electrophysiological criteria for CIDP were originally intended to be able to detect the physiological substrate of demyelination, as this was the only known underlying pathology. However, in essence they are markers for functional disruption or slowing of the saltatory conduction of myelinated axons. In the context of CIDP, conduction block can result from paranodal abnormalities of the myelin sheath, but also from primary dysfunction of the axon at the nodes of Ranvier. Considering that inflammation and demyelination as core features are not present in all CIDP patients, while an autoimmune aetiology is presumed in all patients, the umbrella term 'chronic autoimmune neuropathies' may fit better (Fig. 1). Further discussion will be needed on whether to include other entities such as multifocal motor neuropathy and anti-MAG neuropathy within this term. Recent studies suggested that anti-MAG antibodies can be present in few patients with CIDP without the presence of IgM paraproteinaemia. However, in an overwhelming majority of patients there is also IgM paraproteinaemia, suggesting that the underlying pathomechanism is plasma cell dyscrasia rather than breach of tolerance. Moreover, further studies are needed to determine the diagnostic cut-off of anti-MAG antibodies in those patients without IgM paraproteins as these can also be found in low quantities in other conditions.

### Distinguishing acute-onset CIDP from Guillain-Barrésyndrome with treatment related fluctuations [^116qXUWH]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) patients may worsen after initial treatment (treatment-related fluctuation [TRF]). It is difficult to distinguish GBS-TRF from chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy with acute onset (A-CIDP). The authors compared 13 patients with A-CIDP with 11 patients with GBS-TRF and concluded that A-CIDP should be suspected when a patient with GBS deteriorates after 9 weeks from onset or when deterioration occurs three times or more. Maintenance treatment should then be considered.

### Antecedent infections and vaccinations in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy: a European collaborative study [^115XFR8Z]. Muscle & Nerve (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Aims

Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) may be rarely preceded by infection. A causative link remains unproven, in contrast to Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), which is commonly postinfectious with well-demonstrated pathophysiological mechanisms of molecular mimicry following Campylobacter jejuni enteritis. Uncommonly, infections are reported before the onset of CIDP. In this study we aimed to determine the frequency and characteristics of CIDP occurring after antecedent infections or vaccinations in two large European cohorts.

Methods

We reviewed the records of 268 subjects with "definite" or "probable" CIDP from the Inflammatory Neuropathy Clinic, Birmingham, UK (129 subjects), and from the Serbian national CIDP database (139 subjects).

Results

Twenty-five of 268 (9.3%) subjects had a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection in the 6weeks preceding CIDP onset, and 3 of 268 (1.1%) had received an influenza vaccination. CIDP disease onset occurred at a younger age (mean [standard deviation], 44.25 [17.36] years vs 54.05 [15.19] years; P < .005) and acute-onset CIDP was more common (42.9% vs 12.1%; odds ratio, 5.46; 95% confidence interval, 2.35–12.68; P < .001) in subjects with preceding infections or vaccinations. No differences in CIDP subtype, rates of cerebrospinal fluid protein level elevation, disability, or likelihood of treatment response, were observed.

Discussion

Antecedent infections or vaccinations may precede about 10% of cases of CIDP and are more common in younger subjects. Acute-onset CIDP is more frequent after antecedent events. These findings may suggest specific pathophysiological mechanisms in such cases.

### Differentiation between Guillain-Barrésyndrome and acute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuritis-a prospective follow-up study using ultrasound and neurophysiological measurements [^112rzjoe]. Neurotherapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Differentiation of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and acute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuritis (CIDP) might be intricate in early stages. We compared electrodiagnostics (EDx) and nerve ultrasound (NUS) as tools for early distinction and follow-up. NUS and EDx have been performed at first visitation and after 6 months. The nerve conduction study score (NCSS), the ultrasound pattern sum score (UPSS), and clinical scores were used for comparison. Compared with the 33 GBS patients, the 34 CIDP patients (50% with symptoms < 4 weeks) revealed significant nerve enlargement in ultrasound (p < 0.001) except for the roots and vagus, which exhibited increased values in both groups. EDx has no significant differences between both groups except for the A-wave frequency and the sural sparing pattern, which is more frequent in GBS (Fisher's exact p < 0.05). In the latter, particularly, pure sensory nerves were not enlarged in contrast to CIDP, in which those were mostly enlarged (p < 0.001). This ultrasonic sensory sparing pattern (uSSP) in combination with enlarged roots/vagus is the hallmark finding in GBS with sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value > 85%, whereas in CIDP, enlarged sensory und multifocally enlarged sensorimotor nerves are key differentiation features to GBS. Increased echointensity of the nerves further arises only in CIDP. After 6 months, in CIDP, the significant nerve enlargement persisted, whereas in GBS, all segments almost normalized. Clinical, ultrasonic, and NCS scores correlated significantly over the time. Enlarged roots/vagus in combination with uSSP might facilitate differentiation of GBS and CIDP in the early stage, and ultrasonic 6-month normalization underlines the diagnosis of GBS in cases of uncertainty. Trial Registration: DRKS-ID 00005253.

### Underdiagnosis and diagnostic delay in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy [^117PGo3T]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Detailed clinical records for each patient were reviewed for demographics, presenting complaints, examination findings, initial pre-referral diagnoses, and electrophysiological reports. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination and nerve imaging were performed at different times in the disease course and at different centres and were excluded from the current analysis.

We calculated the frequency of pre-referral diagnosis and alternative diagnoses other than that of CIDP. To calculate the frequency of pre-referral underdiagnoses, delay to final diagnosis of CIDP and delay to receive first treatment, we excluded cases of acute or subacute onset, initially diagnosed with Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) or subacute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (SAIDP), as we considered these were due to unexpected clinical progression rather than diagnostic error.

For each patient, we performed a detailed review of clinical records to ascertain the predominant clinical feature supporting the diagnosis of CIDP. We focussed on four common clinical features of CIDP based on EFNS/PNS criteria which could have potentially contributed to pre-referral underdiagnoses: (i) presence of proximal weakness (for typical CIDP) (ii) presence of multifocal motor and sensory deficits (for Lewis Sumner syndrome (LSS)), (iii) presence of proprioceptive involvement (for typical and sensory forms) and (iv) presence of chronic severe symmetric tetraparesis majorly impacting on upper and lower limb function (for severe forms of typical CIDP). We did not include tendinous areflexia in the abovementioned clinical features as all patients had absent deep tendon reflexes.

### Proteomics analysis of immune response-related proteins in Guillain-Barrésyndrome (GBS) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) [^114eFzVY]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2024). Medium credibility.

The objective is to characterize differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) and Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) through high-throughput analysis. Sera from 11 healthy controls (HCs), 21 GBS and 19 CIDP patients were subjected to Olink Proteomics Analysis. In the comparison between CIDP and GBS groups, up-regulation of ITM2A and down-regulation of NTF4 were observed. Comparing GBS with HCs revealed 18 up-regulated and 4 down-regulated proteins. Comparing CIDP with the HCs identified 15 up-regulated and 4 down-regulated proteins. Additionally, the correlation between clinical characteristics and DEPs were uncovered. In conclusion, the DEPs have significant potential to advance our understanding of the pathogenesis in these debilitating neurological disorders.

### Underdiagnosis and diagnostic delay in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy [^111mV1o3]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The frequency and causes of underdiagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) are uncertain. We aimed to assess the frequency and electroclinical features of pre-referral CIDP underdiagnosis and the duration of delay prior to diagnosis and treatment initiation in a tertiary specialist clinic.

Methods

We retrospectively investigated 60 consecutive patients attending our Inflammatory Neuropathy Service, between 2015 and 2019, with a final diagnosis of treatment-responsive definite/probable CIDP. We reviewed the clinical and electrophysiological data in light of European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society (EFNS/PNS) guidelines and determined the frequency, causes and delay in diagnosis of CIDP.

Results

An initial alternative diagnosis to that of CIDP had been made in 68.3% (41/60) of patients. The commonest alternative diagnosis was of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in 23.3% (14/60) patients. Non-GBS underdiagnoses (27/60; 45%) mainly consisted of genetic neuropathy (8/27; 29.6%), diabetic neuropathy (5/27; 18.5%) and chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy (4/27; 14.8%). Non-GBS underdiagnoses were predominantly due to non-recognition of proximal weakness (70.4%), multifocal deficits (18.5%) or proprioceptive loss (7.4%). Electrophysiological misinterpretation was contributory to pre-referral non-GBS underdiagnoses of CIDP in 85% of patients. Mean diagnostic delay in patients with non-GBS underdiagnoses of CIDP was of 21.3 months (range 2–132 months).

Conclusion

Underdiagnosis of CIDP is frequent and may lead to significant diagnostic and treatment delay. We suggest that lack of comprehensive and precise attention to typical electroclinical features of CIDP and its diagnostic criteria at the time of initial evaluation are equally contributory to underdiagnoses.

### Pathology explains various mechanisms of auto-immune inflammatory peripheral neuropathies [^114EeNdc]. Brain Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

3 CLASSIFICATION OF THE PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHIES

Since the end of the 19th century, peripheral neuropathies have been classified according to their clinical characteristics, leading, over time, to the following possibilities: symmetrical (polyneuropathy) or asymmetrical (mononeuropathy and multiple mononeuropathy), involvement including nerve roots (polyradiculoneuropathy) and involvement primarily affecting the cell bodies (neuronopathy). Peripheral neuropathies can also be classified according to their mode of onset: acute (onset in less than 4 weeks), subacute (onset in 4 to 8 weeks), chronic (onset in more than 8 weeks), or relapsing–remitting. Since the middle of the 20th century, with the development of clinical neurophysiology, peripheral neuropathies are traditionally classified as "demyelinating" or "axonal", according to whether the pathologic process affects primarily the myelin/SC or the axon.

In the 1990's, this traditional dichotomy ("axonal" vs. "demyelinating") has been questioned when some subtypes of Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) were identified as " axonal GBS " (nowadays known as "acute motor axonal neuropathy" [AMAN] or "acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy", [AMSAN]). However, in AMAN/AMSAN, the primary attack is directed toward the excitable nodal axolemma, inducing a temporary failure of conduction at the NoR named "reversible conduction failure" (RCF), possibly because of loss of Nav channels, (distinguishing it from the classical demyelinating conduction block); secondary, there may be (in the more severe cases) axonal degeneration (giving an electrophysiological pattern of axonal neuropathy). The recent discovery of pathogenic antibodies targeting the nodal and/or the paranodal regions has led to the recognition of a new group of antibody‐mediated neuropathies, nowadays called "nodoparanodopathies": this term was first proposed to characterize a common pathogenic mechanism of dysfunction/disruption at the NoR resulting in a pathophysiological continuum from transitory nerve conduction failure to axonal degeneration. It is difficult to determine the incidence of this new entity, which may be around 5% of GBS and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) patients. A new classification of autoimmune peripheral neuropathies based on the involved domains of the myelinated fiber and, when known, on the antigen has now been presented.

### The role of IVIg in autoimmune neuropathies: the latest evidence [^111D8e1H]. Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) are the major immune neuropathies. Although a detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of these conditions is not yet available, the multiple effects of IVIg on the immune and inflammatory process recommend it as an agent worthy of investigation in these diseases. Following recent research, IVIg is now recommended as a first-line treatment option for moderate or severe GBS to be administered within two weeks of disease onset. With regard to CIDP, a Cochrane review demonstrated significant short-term improvements in disability and impairment with IVIg. The ICE (IGIV CIDP Efficacy trial) study group undertook the largest ever trial of IVIg for CIDP, which demonstrated for the first time the long-term efficacy of IVIg. The results of this ICE trial demonstrated the efficacy of IVIg in CIDP, with a significantly higher response rate versus placebo after 24 weeks of treatment (P = 0.0002). Furthermore, long-term maintenance with IVIg also significantly reduced the rate of relapse (P < 0.011). On the basis of available data, IVIg can be recommended as a first-line treatment option for GBS and CIDP. For MMN, although the evidence for IVIg is limited, there is no evidence to recommend other treatments.

### To be, or not to be… Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^115CSE29]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is currently the most frequent cause of acute flaccid paralysis on a global scale, being an autoimmune disorder wherein demyelination of the peripheral nerves occurs. Its main clinical features are a symmetrical ascending muscle weakness with reduced osteotendinous reflexes and variable sensory involvement. GBS most commonly occurs after an infection, especially viral (including COVID-19), but may also transpire after immunization with certain vaccines or in the development of specific malignancies. Immunoglobulins, plasmapheresis, and glucocorticoids represent the principal treatment modalities, however patients with severe disease progression may require supportive therapy in an intensive care unit. Due to its symptomology, which overlaps with numerous neurological and infectious illnesses, the diagnosis of GBS may often be misattributed to pathologies that are essentially different from this syndrome. Moreover, many of these require specific treatment methods distinct to those recommended for GBS, in lack of which the prognosis of the patient is drastically affected. Such diseases include exposure to toxins either environmental or foodborne, central nervous system infections, metabolic or serum ion alterations, demyelinating pathologies, or even conditions amenable to neurosurgical intervention. This extensive narrative review aims to systematically and comprehensively tackle the most notable and challenging differential diagnoses of GBS, emphasizing on the clinical discrepancies between the diseases, the appropriate paraclinical investigations, and suitable management indications.

### Diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy [^1135pxPD]. Muscle & Nerve (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a chronic immune-mediated peripheral form of polyneuropathy. No reliable diagnostic biomarkers are available by which to make the diagnosis of CIDP. As a result, diagnosis of the condition can be challenging. Many patients are not recognized early in the disease course, and on the other end of the spectrum both establishing early and accurate diagnosis as well as avoiding misdiagnosis and overtreatment. Identification of the hallmark clinical, electrophysiological, and laboratory features of the disease are critical to facilitate rapid diagnosis, while an understanding of diagnostic pitfalls can help prevent misdiagnosis. Since the original description of CIDP in the 1970s, over 15 sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed. The criteria published in 2021 by the European Academy of Neurology / Peripheral Nerve Society (EAN/PNS) were developed for use during routine clinical care and are available in the public domain. These criteria provide clinicians with an invaluable resource by which the data collected during the evaluation of the patient with possible CIDP can be interpreted. One point of importance that bridges diagnosis to treatment is objectification of the treatment response. Interpretation of how patients respond to treatment drives both long-term treatment paradigms and the diagnosis at which these treatments are aimed. Although no approach is perfect, utilization of strength impairment and disability outcomes in clinical practice can help unravel the difficulties in interpreting response to treatment. Just as improvement in these outcomes is considered diagnostically supportive, the absence of objective benefit argues against it and should prompt reconsideration of a CIDP diagnosis.

Regarding medical management for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, more specifically with respect to IVIG, EAN/PNS 2021 guidelines recommend to consider administering IVIG (2 g/kg, divided over 2–5 days, followed by 2–5 repeated doses of 1 g/kg every 3 weeks if there is no response to the first course) as an initial treament option for induction therapy in patients with typical CIDP or CIDP variants in the presence of disabling symptoms.

### Inflammatory neuropathies: pathology, molecular markers and targets for specific therapeutic intervention [^116ZB69W]. Acta Neuropathologica (2015). Low credibility.

Inflammatory neuropathies encompass groups of heterogeneous disorders characterized by pathogenic immune-mediated hematogenous leukocyte infiltration of peripheral nerves, nerve roots or both, with resultant demyelination or axonal degeneration or both. Inflammatory neuropathies may be divided into three major disease categories: Guillain-Barré syndrome (particularly the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy variant), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy and nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy (or peripheral nerve vasculitis). Despite major advances in molecular biology, pathology and genetics, the pathogenesis of these disorders remains elusive. There is insufficient knowledge on the mechanisms of hematogenous leukocyte trafficking into the peripheral nervous system to guide the development of specific molecular therapies for immune-mediated inflammatory neuropathies compared to disorders such as psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis. The recent isolation and characterization of human endoneurial endothelial cells that form the blood-nerve barrier provides an opportunity to elucidate leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions critical to the pathogenesis of inflammatory neuropathies at the interface between the systemic circulation and peripheral nerve endoneurium. This review discusses our current knowledge of the classic pathological features of inflammatory neuropathies, attempts at molecular classification and genetic determinants, the utilization of in vitro and in vivo animal models to determine pathogenic mechanisms at the interface between the systemic circulation and the peripheral nervous system relevant to these disorders and prospects for future potential molecular pathology biomarkers and targets for specific therapeutic intervention.

Patient demographics

We described the age distribution of GBS cases after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and compared this with the age distribution of prepandemic GBS cases. Because GBS incidence estimates vary by setting, we obtained data for background GBS rates from Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care data, which holds details of discharge diagnoses for all NHS hospital admissions in England. We defined an incident case of GBS as an International Classification of Diseases-10 code of G61.0 (Guillain-Barré syndrome) or G52.7 (disorders of multiple cranial nerves, to capture polyneuritis cranialis) in any of the first five diagnosis fields. Repeat episodes within 365 days for the same patient were identified by using the unique identifier Hospital Episode Statistics ID and excluded. A previous study found this approach had a high positive predictive value for an incident episode of GBS. We combined admissions between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2019 to calculate the age distribution of GBS cases in England during this period. Age-specific incidence rates for the period were calculated using Office for National Statistics midyear population estimates from 2020.

Clinical features and outcomes

To examine whether the clinical features of GBS following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination differed from GBS linked to other causes, we compared our patients with those recruited by the International GBS Outcome Study (IGOS), a prospective observational study published the year before the COVID-19 pandemic started. Because there are regional differences in GBS variants, treatment and outcomes between low-income and middle-income versus high-income countries, we compared our patients with the European and American cohort of the IGOS study consisting of 715 (77%) of the total 925 IGOS patients. Serum of our patients was tested for antiganglioside antibodies through NHS diagnostic laboratories at the discretion of the treating clinicians, and nerve conduction studies were conducted as clinically indicated using local protocols and categorised locally into demyelinating, axonal, inexcitable, equivocal or normal by the reporting clinicians.

Outcome was assessed at 3 months after vaccination using the GBS disability score at routine inpatient or outpatient follow-ups held by the treating clinicians. At this point, we also assessed patients' clinical course and determined whether some patients initially diagnosed with GBS might have had an alternative diagnosis, including acute onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), which is a recognised mimic of GBS early on.

The emergence of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has presented an unprecedented global challenge. Vaccines against COVID have been developed to date. Covid-19 has been linked with the development of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), a rare immune-mediated demyelinating neuropathy. We report three cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome and one case of Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP), presenting to a Tasmanian hospital, and review 15 other reported cases and discuss likely immunopathology. Nearly all reported cases of post-COVID-19 vacciation inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy are linked to AstraZeneca vaccination and a variant with bifacial weakness is the most reported form of GBS globally.

### Pathology explains various mechanisms of auto-immune inflammatory peripheral neuropathies [^116hn3TV]. Brain Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Autoimmune neuropathies are a heterogeneous group of rare and disabling diseases in which the immune system is thought to target antigens in the peripheral nervous system: they usually respond to immune therapies. Guillain–Barré syndrome is divided into several subtypes including "acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy", "acute motor axonal neuropathy", "acute motor sensory neuropathy", and other variants. Chronic forms such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and other subtypes and polyneuropathy associated with IgM monoclonal gammopathy; autoimmune nodopathies also belong to this group of auto‐immune neuropathies. It has been shown that immunoglobulin G from the serum of about 30% of CIDP patients immunolabels nodes of Ranvier or paranodes of myelinated axons. Whatever the cause of myelin damage of the peripheral nervous system, the initial attack on myelin by a dysimmune process may begin either at the internodal area or in the paranodal and nodal regions. The term "nodoparanodopathy" was first applied to some "axonal Guillain–Barré syndrome" subtypes, then extended to cases classified as CIDP bearing IgG4 antibodies against paranodal axoglial proteins. In these cases, paranodal dissection develops in the absence of macrophage‐induced demyelination. In contrast, the mechanisms of demyelination of other dysimmune neuropathies induced by macrophages are unexplained, as no antibodies have been identified in such cases. The main objective of this presentation is to show that the pathology illustrates, confirms, and may explain such mechanisms.

Conclusions

Despite extensive efforts, a unifying immunopathological mechanism remains to be established for either the acute or chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathies. On the other hand, there is significant phenotypic variability in the clinical spectrum of CIDP suggesting that there are differing immunopathological mechanisms at play. Further progress in the understanding of the pathogenesis of CIDP may come from a 'splitting' rather than 'lumping' approach as exemplified by the current interest in the recently defined antibodies targeting nodal and paranodal antigens. These antibodies while present in only a small number of cases, in the range of 2–5%, may allow us to understand the pathogenesis of CIDP and its variants, to define subtypes of CIDP that will respond to differing forms of immunomodulation and provide reproducible biomarkers that will allow disease and treatment monitoring. It was the recognition more than 20 years ago of differing subtypes of GBS which led to the major advances in the understanding of that disorder and the more recent discovery of different pathogenic mechanisms underlying subtypes of the central demyelinating disorder MS has shown that unique treatment regimes are needed for these differing pathological processes. More work needs to be undertaken to explain the immunopathogenesis of the majority of CIDP cases, but significant progress has been made which should translate into better patient stratification and subsequently improved care.

All cases are unique, and very similar to others.

### Diagnosis of motor neuropathy [^115zV7f5]. European Journal of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Motor neuropathy is a clinical entity which leads to consideration of a wide spectrum of peripheral nerve disorders. Firstly, it may be distinguished from other causes of peripheral motor involvement such as muscle diseases and disorders of the neuromuscular junction. Secondly, it may be discussed in two different forms: acute and chronic. Acute chronic neuropathies are mainly observed in Guillain-Barré syndrome, in which electrophysiological studies allow us to recognize the classical demyelinating form and the axonal form. The other causes of acute motor neuropathy are mainly poliomyelitis and porphyrias. Chronic motor neuropathies are mainly observed in motor neuron diseases, mainly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but also Kennedy's disease and other lower motor neuron diseases which may be inherited or acquired. The other causes are multifocal motor neuropathy and the predominantly motor forms of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The characterization of these different types of chronic neuropathy is of major importance because of the therapeutic consequences which may lead to the proposal of specific treatments.

Step 8: managing clinical progression

Insufficient response to treatment

About 40% of patients treated with standard doses of plasma exchange or IVIg do not improve in the first 4 weeks following treatment. Such disease progression does not imply that the treatment is ineffective, as progression might have been worse without therapy. Clinicians may consider repeating the treatment or changing to an alternative treatment, but at present no evidence exists that this approach will improve the outcome. A clinical trial investigating the effect of administering a second IVIg dose is ongoing.

Treatment-related fluctuations

TRFs are observed in 6–10% of patients with GBS and are defined as disease progression occurring within 2 months following an initial treatment-induced clinical improvement or stabilization. TRFs should be distinguished from clinical progression without any initial response to treatment. The general view is that a TRF indicates that the treatment effect has worn off while the inflammatory phase of the disease is still ongoing. Therefore, patients with GBS who display TRFs might benefit from further treatment, and repeating the full course of IVIg or plasma exchange in these patients is a common practice, although evidence to support this approach is lacking.

CIDP

In ~5% of patients with GBS, repeated clinical relapses suggest a more chronic disease process, and the diagnosis is changed to acute-onset CIDP. Acute-onset CIDP typically presents with three or more TRFs and/or clinical deterioration ≥ 8 weeks after disease onset.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome [^111Jtb6C]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a group of autoimmune syndromes consisting of demyelinating and acute axonal degenerating forms of the disease. Nerve conduction study helps differentiate the heterogeneous subtypes of GBS. Patients exhibit a progressive paralysis that reaches a plateau phase. In most patients, resolution is complete or near complete. Mortality from GBS most often is associated with dysautonomia and mechanical ventilation. GBS usually is associated with an antecedent infection by one of several known pathogens. Cross-reactivity between the pathogen and the nerve tissue sets up the autoimmune response. Treatment consists of supportive care, ventilatory management (in about one third of patients), and specific therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis. Consultation with a neurologist is suggested.

Results

Study population and sample availability

In total, 293 patients with GBS were included in this study (figure 1). Patients had a median age of 57 (IQR: 42–67), and 65.2% of patients were male. A median of 3 (IQR: 2–4) longitudinal serum samples were available per patient. Baseline characteristics did not differ between the SID-GBS cohort and subcohorts based on availability of serum samples at each time point (table 1). Of the 293 included patients, 81 were randomised (43 for placebo, 48 for a second IVIg dose).

### Antibodies in autoimmune neuropathies: what to test, how to test, why to test [^111JUQDK]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune neuropathies are a heterogeneous group of immune-mediated disorders of the peripheral nerves. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) are the archetypal acute and chronic forms. Over the past few decades, pathogenic antibodies targeting antigens of the peripheral nervous system and driving peripheral nerve damage in selected patients have been described. Moreover, the detection of these antibodies has diagnostic and therapeutic implications that have prompted a modification of the GBS and CIDP diagnostic algorithms. GBS diagnosis is based in clinical criteria, and systematic testing of anti-ganglioside antibodies is not required. Nonetheless, a positive anti-ganglioside antibody test may support the clinical suspicion when diagnosis of GBS (GM1 IgG), Miller Fisher (GQ1b IgG), or acute sensory-ataxic (GD1b IgG) syndromes is uncertain. Anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) IgM and anti-disialosyl IgM antibodies are key in the diagnosis of anti-MAG neuropathy and chronic ataxic neuropathy, ophthalmoplegia, M-protein, cold agglutinins, and disialosyl antibodies spectrum neuropathies, respectively, and help differentiating these conditions from CIDP. Recently, the field has been boosted by the discovery of pathogenic antibodies targeting proteins of the node of Ranvier contactin-1, contactin-associated protein 1, and nodal and paranodal isoforms of neurofascin (NF140, NF186, or NF155). These antibodies define subgroups of patients with specific clinical (most importantly poor or partial response to conventional therapies and excellent response to anti-CD20 therapy) and pathologic (node of Ranvier disruption in the absence of inflammation) features that led to the definition of the "autoimmune nodopathy" diagnostic category and to the incorporation of nodal/paranodal antibodies to clinical routine testing. The purpose of this review was to provide a practical vision for the general neurologist of the use of antibodies in the clinical assessment of autoimmune neuropathies.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^1128cSJB]. Neurocritical Care (2023). High credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) axonal electrophysiologic subtype — when counseling family members and/or surrogates of patients with acute GBS, we suggest that an axonal electrophysiologic subtype during the acute presentation not be considered a reliable predictor of poor functional outcome assessed at 6 months or later (weak recommendation; very low-quality evidence). The predictor encompasses differentiation of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, acute motor axonal neuropathy, and acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy, but there is no standardized single definition of axonal subtype, variable use of electrophysiologic criteria, no standardized requirement for site and number of motor and sensory nerve conduction studies per limb, and no consistent time point for neurophysiology assessment; an important limitation is the absence of standardized criteria to identify an axonal electrophysiological pattern in GBS.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy:

- **Definition**: CIDP is an acquired immune-mediated neuropathy characterized by progressive or relapsing motor and sensory dysfunction due to demyelination of peripheral nerves.
- **Pathophysiology**: CIDP results from immune-mediated destruction of the myelin sheath in peripheral nerves, triggered by both cellular and humoral immune mechanisms. Inflammatory infiltrates composed of macrophages and T cells damage Schwann cell membranes, disrupting saltatory conduction and slowing or blocking nerve transmission. Segmental demyelination and remyelination cycles result in onion bulb formation and eventual axonal loss in chronic disease, contributing significantly to permanent disability and resistance to treatment. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 have been observed, indicating chronic antigen exposure and immune system overactivity. Autoantibodies against nodal and paranodal proteins, such as neurofascin or contactin, have been identified in some CIDP variants, suggesting a role for targeted immune responses in pathogenesis.
- **Epidemiology**: CIDP is the most common chronic autoimmune neuropathy, with an incidence of 0.15–10.6 cases and a prevalence of 0.67–10.3 cases per 100,000 population. It is more common in males and typically presents between ages 40 and 60.
- **Risk factors**: CIDP can occur in isolation or be associated with systemic conditions such as diabetes mellitus, HIV, HCV, SLE, and monoclonal gammopathy.
- **Disease course**: CIDP typically presents with symmetric, progressive weakness proximal and distal and sensory deficits, evolving over at least 8 weeks. Areflexia, large-fiber sensory loss, sensory ataxia, impaired proprioception, gait disturbances, and neuropathic pain are common. Some patients follow a relapsing-remitting pattern, while others have a steadily progressive course.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: CIDP is generally responsive to immunomodulatory therapies, including IVIG, corticosteroids, and plasma exchange. Approximately 60–80% of patients respond favorably to initial treatments. Some patients experience persistent disability due to irreversible axonal damage. Long-term remission rates vary, with approximately 40% of patients achieving sustained remission, while others require ongoing maintenance therapy. CIDP has a relatively low mortality rate (approximately 3.3%), but significant morbidity can occur, particularly in untreated or inadequately treated cases.

### Immune mediated neuropathies – an update on therapeutic strategies [^117WPfjy]. Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

This paper reviews recent treatment strategies of immune mediated neuropathies, in particular it includes data regarding Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), neuropathy with IgM monoclonal gammopathy and other dysglobulinemic neuropathies. In the treatment of Guillain- Barré syndrome, there is no significant difference between IVIg, plasma exchange or plasma exchange followed by IVIg. However, for reasons of convenience and safety, IVIg is used as standard treatment in most centers. There is so far insufficient evidence for the use of corticosteroids in the therapy of GBS. In treating CIDP corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange seem to be equally effective. However, the high costs and relative lack of availability of IVIg, the only short-term benefit and the invasive nature of the plasma exchange procedure, and on the other hand serious long-term side effects of corticosteroids are the most important disadvantages of these treatments and have to be taken into consideration before a decision about therapy can be made. In multifocal motor neuropathy the intravenous immunoglobulin therapy is the only treatment that has been shown to be effective in controlled trials. However, inadequate response in a proportion of patients, high cost and variable availability of IVIg show the need for the search of adjunctive immunosuppressive therapies. Neuropathies with IgM monoclonal gammopathy may improve after treatment with chemotherapeutic agents, though the long-term effects are not known. In addition, such treatment modalities may be associated with serious side effect and even severe toxicity. Recent data support the use of a new promising drug: Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the B cell surface membrane marker CD 20.

### An electrophysiological classification associated with Guillain-Barrésyndrome outcomes [^116WsxT3]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute, post-infectious, inflammatory, autoimmune peripheral neuropathy with a highly diverse clinical course and outcome. We classified GBS on the basis of patients' first nerve conduction and validated this system to be associated with outcome on the basis of electrophysiological characteristics during the acute phase of GBS. We retrospectively evaluated 40 GBS patients who underwent their first electrophysiological study within 14 days of onset and classified GBS into four patterns: (1) acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) pattern with sensory nerve conduction abnormalities (motor-sensory AIDP: MS-AIDP), (2) AIDP pattern without sensory nerve conduction abnormalities (motor AIDP: M-AIDP), (3) acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) pattern, and (4) minor abnormalities pattern. We compared the clinical, electrophysiological, and laboratory findings between groups and determined subgroups associated with poor outcome. The MS-AIDP and AMAN patterns more frequently exhibited prolonged recovery compared with the M-AIDP and minor abnormalities patterns and were associated with prolonged recovery (specificity, 100%; sensitivity, 73%; P < 0.001). The period of inability to walk independently was significantly longer in the MS-AIDP and AMAN patterns than in the M-AIDP and minor abnormalities patterns (median 85 vs. 10 days; P < 0.001). In conclusion, our classification of GBS using a single nerve conduction study in the early phase of disease is associated with outcomes. This classification can be used to counsel individual patients and guide decision-making with respect to treatment.

### Immunologic neuromuscular disorders [^116yg2Sw]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Immune-mediated disorders of each of the structural subdivisions of the nervous and neuromuscular system have been described. Despite the immune privilege of the central nervous system, and to a lesser extent the peripheral nervous system, immune dysregulation is not uncommon. Environmental, genetic, and immunologic factors have been postulated to be involved in the development of these disorders. Major immune-mediated neurologic diseases of the central nervous system include multiple sclerosis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Immune-mediated diseases of the peripheral nervous system include myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, idiopathic polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and inclusion body myositis. Some of these disorders, such as myasthenia gravis and certain forms of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, are clearly autoimmune in nature, whereas the immune system plays an important role in pathogenesis in others. Understanding the immune mechanisms of disease and uncovering potential therapeutic targets are essential for the design of new treatments. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria, and current therapeutic approaches to the major neuroimmunologic diseases are reviewed.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF

An inflammatory neuropathy is likely if onset and progression are acute or subacute (over days or weeks), along with elevated CSF protein and improvement of symptoms upon immunosuppression or immunomodulation. GBS is most likely if the neuropathy is acute, inflammatory, and monophasic. Mimics include peripheral and central nervous system disorders, and in some cases only time will confirm or refute a diagnosis of GBS. Figure 4 summarises the differential diagnosis of GBS based on localisation.

Peripheral nerve mimics of GBS

CIDP may have a GBS‐like acute presentation with sensory‐motor disturbance (acute CIDP or A‐CIDP). Similarly, autoimmune nodopathies (AIN) can be acute and monophasic, but often have additional features. In particular, patients with NF186 or pan‐neurofascin antibodies (against NF155, NF140, and NF186) often have a severe, GBS‐like neuropathy with cranio‐respiratory and autonomic involvement. Three or more TRFs, progression or (re)deterioration over 8 weeks from onset, or substantial sensory disturbance (including sensory ataxia) make A‐CIDP or an autoimmune nodopathy more likely. Slow disease onset (defined as > 2 weeks from onset to nadir) and/or significant early reduction in motor CV may also suggest an alternative diagnosis. It is important to distinguish GBS from CIDP as the latter can respond to corticosteroids, often requires long‐term or repeated treatment, and might be responsive to steroid‐sparing immunosuppression. On the contrary, autoimmune nodopathies respond poorly to conventional therapies (IVIg, PLEX, corticosteroids) and may benefit from B cell depleting immunomodulation with the monoclonal antibody rituximab if given early in the disease course.

INTRODUCTION

Inflammatory neuropathies are a heterogeneous group of rare diseases of the peripheral nervous system that include acute and chronic diseases, such as Guillain−Barré syndrome (GBS) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). GBS can be divided into two major subtypes: acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), the most frequent form in the Western world, and acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), most frequent in Asia and Japan. CIDP is the most common chronic immune‐mediated inflammatory polyneuropathy. Both AIDP and CIDP have different temporal evolutions but can present overlapping clinical features during early stages of disease. Similarly to AIDP, CIDP is mainly characterized by a demyelinating pathology. In contrast to AIDP, a common feature of chronic inflammatory neuropathies is the chronic progressive course. AIDP reaches maximum gravity within the first 4 weeks of symptom onset in a single‐phase course, whereas CIDP typically presents insidious progression lasting 8 weeks or longer, with a most often progressive course. Both AIDP and CIDP diagnostic strategies rely on clinical, electroneuromyography and cerebrospinal findings, but misdiagnosis, especially for CIDP, is very common. Anadani and Katirji reported three patients with acute‐onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (A‐CIDP) who were initially diagnosed with severe GBS but were later confirmed to have CIDP based on the clinical course. Although CIDP is defined as a progressive or relapsing condition that develops over at least 2 months, previous studies have shown that up to 16% of CIDP patients may present acutely. Such patients are usually initially diagnosed with AIDP, but later, as they either relapse or continue to progress beyond 2 months, they are then correctly diagnosed as having CIDP. This phenotype is known as A‐CIDP and can be confused with AIDP, leading to delayed treatment.

### Changes in electrophysiological findings suggestive of demyelination following Guillain-Barrésyndrome: a retrospective study [^113kfs56]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Aims

Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) is the most common form of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in Western countries. However, electrophysiological descriptions of changes in abnormalities suggestive of demyelination after an AIDP episode are rare. We aimed to describe the clinical and electrophysiological features of AIDP patients after the acute episode, to investigate changes in abnormalities suggestive of demyelination and to compare with electrophysiological features of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP).

Methods

We reviewed the clinical and electrophysiological characteristics of 61 patients followed at regular intervals after the AIDP episode.

Results

We detected early electrophysiological abnormalities from the first nerve conduction studies (NCS) performed before 3 wk. Abnormalities suggestive of demyelination worsened on subsequent examinations. This worsening continued after more than 3 mo of follow-up for some parameters. We also found the persistence of abnormalities suggestive of demyelination for long periods after the acute episode, beyond 18mo of follow-up, despite clinical improvement in most patients.

Discussion

In AIDP, NCS findings continue to worsen several weeks or even months after the onset of symptoms, and "CIDP-like" abnormalities suggestive of demyelination may persist for a long period of time, in contrast to the existing literature and the usually favorable clinical course. Thus, the discovery of conduction abnormalities on NCS performed long after an AIDP should always be interpreted according to the clinical context and not systematically lead to a diagnosis of CIDP.

### The importance of rare subtypes in diagnosis and treatment of peripheral neuropathy: a review [^115S7eq4]. JAMA Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Peripheral neuropathy is a prevalent condition that usually warrants a thorough history and examination but has limited diagnostic evaluation. However, rare localizations of peripheral neuropathy often require more extensive diagnostic testing and different treatments.

Objective

To describe rare localizations of peripheral neuropathy, including the appropriate diagnostic evaluation and available treatments.

Evidence Review

References were identified from PubMed searches conducted on May 29, 2015, with an emphasis on systematic reviews and randomized clinical trials. Articles were also identified through the use of the authors' own files. Search terms included common rare neuropathy localizations and their causes, as well as epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment.

Findings

Diffuse, nonlength-dependent neuropathies, multiple mononeuropathies, polyradiculopathies, plexopathies, and radiculoplexus neuropathies are rare peripheral neuropathy localizations that often require extensive diagnostic testing. Atypical neuropathy features, such as acute/subacute onset, asymmetry, and/or motor predominant signs, are frequently present. The most common diffuse, nonlength-dependent neuropathies are Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, multifocal motor neuropathy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Effective disease-modifying therapies exist for many diffuse, nonlength-dependent neuropathies including Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, multifocal motor neuropathy, and some paraprotein-associated demyelinating neuropathies. Vasculitic neuropathy (multiple mononeuropathy) also has efficacious treatment options, but definitive evidence of a treatment effect for IgM anti-MAG neuropathy and diabetic amyotrophy (radiculoplexus neuropathy) is lacking.

Conclusions and Relevance

Recognition of rare localizations of peripheral neuropathy is essential given the implications for diagnostic testing and treatment. Electrodiagnostic studies are an important early step in the diagnostic evaluation and provide information on the localization and pathophysiology of nerve injury.

### A study on the role of serum uric acid in differentiating acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy from acute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy [^117F5cSP]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Clinical symptoms and laboratory indices for acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome, and acute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (A-CIDP) were analyzed to identify factors that could contribute to early differential diagnosis.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed on 44 AIDP and 44 A-CIDP patients looking for any demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations or laboratory parameters that might differentiate AIDP from acutely presenting CIDP.

Results

In Guillain-Barré syndrome patients (N = 63), 69.84% (N = 44) were classified as having AIDP, 19.05% (N = 12) were found to have acute motor axonal neuropathy, 6.35% (N = 4) were found to have acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy, and 4.76% (N = 3) were found to have Miller Fisher syndrome. Serum uric acid (UA) was higher in A-CIDP patients (329.55 ± 72.23μmol/L) than in AIDP patients (221.08 ± 71.32μmol/L) (p = 0.000). Receiver operating characteristic analyses indicated that the optimal UA cutoff was 283.50μmol/L. Above this level, patients were more likely to present A-CIDP than AIDP (specificity 81.80%, sensitivity 81.80%). During the follow-up process, serum samples were effectively collected from 19 AIDP patients during the rehabilitation phase and 28 A-CIDP patients during the remission stage, and it was found that UA levels were significantly increased in A-CIDP (remission) (298.9 ± 90.39μmol/L) compared with AIDP (rehabilitation) (220.1 ± 108.2μmol/L, p = 0.009).

Conclusion

These results suggest that serum UA level can help to differentiate AIDP from A-CIDP with high specificity and sensitivity, which is helpful for early diagnosis and guidance of treatment.

### Antibodies to neurofascin exacerbate adoptive transfer experimental autoimmune neuritis [^1124ys1t]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2014). Low credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy are autoimmune disorders of the peripheral nervous system in which autoantibodies are implicated in the disease pathogenesis. Recent work has focused on the nodal regions of the myelinated axon as potential autoantibody targets. Here we screened patient sera for autoantibodies to neurofascin and assessed the pathophysiological relevance of anti-neurofascin antibodies in vivo. Levels of anti-neurofascin antibodies were higher in sera from patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy when compared with those of controls. Anti-neurofascin antibodies exacerbated and prolonged adoptive transfer experimental autoimmune neuritis and caused conduction defects when injected intraneurally.

### Clinical features of Guillain-Barrésyndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuritis associated with SLE [^111NTNgD]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we described the basic characteristics, clinical features and treatment outcomes in a cohort of nine patients with SLE complicated with inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuritis. GBS is a rare autoimmune disorder usually presenting as rapid-onset flaccid paralysis and numbness, with the highest incidence in patients aged 50–70 years.CIDP has a progressive or relapsing-remitting course over 8 weeks, most common in patients between 40 and 60 years old.GBS and CIDP are polyneuropathies due to demyelination, whose mechanistic associations with SLE are not entirely clear, but most likely have an immunological basis. Most patients in our cohort were female, due to the predominantly female demographic of SLE, and though not significant, GBS seemed to afflict younger patients than CIDP.

All patients experienced the classic symptoms of either paresthesia or weakness in the bilateral limbs. Cytoalbuminologic dissociation was apparent in all cases, as in those with pure GBS. High CSF protein levels in GBS patients were reported to be associated with greater disease severity. One of our cases had a CSF protein level of 7.09 g/L, and the patient experienced severe complications with no marked improvements after treatment. However, due to insufficient sample size, we could only speculate that the correlation holds for GBS associated with SLE. On the other hand, while previous statistics suggest that CSF antiganglioside antibodies were positive in approximately half of GBS and CIDP patients, the antibodies were negative for all tested patients in our cohort. Existing studies are contradictory regarding the role of antiganglioside antibodies in the diagnosis of NPSLE, and previous cases of SLE-related GBS or CIDP did not report on antiganglioside antibodies. Therefore, it remained unclear whether antiganglioside antibodies are useful markers in the diagnosis of SLE-related GBS and CIDP.

### Electrodiagnostic subtyping in Guillain-Barrésyndrome patients in the international Guillain-Barréoutcome study [^116BtnQ6]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Subtyping GBS by NCS criteria is complicated by the lack of a gold standard. Multiple criterion sets were published before, including the more recently developed criteria by Uncini et al. requiring a second EDx study and sensory data. Although NCS subtyping is suggested to reflect the underlying pathological process, that is, axonal degeneration or demyelination of peripheral nerves, pathological studies to confirm this are usually not available. Moreover, this dichotomous view as usually stated as AIDP versus acute motor axonal neuropathy is probably too simplistic: axonal degeneration is often present in demyelinating subtypes and decline in nerve conduction velocities resembling a demyelinating process might also be present in axonal neuropathies with conduction slowing being CMAP amplitude dependent. Also, in early stage GBS axonal degeneration and demyelination might be preceded by endoneurial edema, especially in proximal nerve trunks. Our results confirmed these previous findings of amplitude‐related conduction slowing, which was explained by loss of large, faster‐conducting nerve fibers and the abnormal slow conduction velocities in regenerating motor fibers. In the acute stage of GBS, conduction slowing might represent demyelination or reversible conduction failure as well as loss of fast‐conducting motor nerve fibers by Wallerian‐like axonal degeneration. Discriminating the role of each process finally resulting in conduction slowing in an individual patient is complex, although some factors might be helpful: (1) excessive temporal dispersion of the CMAP (except the tibial nerve) is generally considered a demyelinating process; (2) follow‐up NCS studies might reveal reversible conduction failure but are not useful in the early stages; and (3) conduction slowing in ALS patients showed mild to moderate signs of conduction slowing, but exceptions with severe conduction slowing were present although the European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) criteria were never fulfilled. Therefore, in GBS, unraveling the underlying pathological process based on EDx studies alone is limited. In the classification of GBS, besides the results of EDx studies other features should also be taken into account such as clinical characteristics, anti‐ganglioside antibodies, infectious antecedents and biomarkers for axonal loss (e.g. neurofilament light chain, peripherin) in order to get a better understanding of the full spectrum of subtypes and the heterogeneity of GBS, and future studies in IGOS might contribute to this.

### Autoantibody-mediated dysfunction of sympathetic neurons in Guillain-Barrésyndrome… [^115u5m8V]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Noradrenaline levels declined in cultures treated with control IgG, but not in those exposed to GBS-IgG. CIDP indicates chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy; RRMS, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis; ✱ p <. 05; error bars, standard error of the mean. In these and all subsequent experiments, cells were incubated with different human IgG in a concentration of 0. 1 mg/mL, based on preliminary experiments and previous studies using comparable doses of purified human IgG in other in vitro paradigms. 15–18 Each experimental condition was done in 3 to 4 wells and repeated 2 to 3 times. Because the underlying disease is the independent variable for our experiments, data are summarized and analyzed in a way to detect differences between each disorder.

In contrast, by analyzing the noradrenaline release before and after 24 hours' incubation with different IgG, noradrenaline levels decreased in cell cultures, which were incubated with CIDP-IgG or RRMS-IgG, but not in those incubated with purified GBS-IgG. Tyrosine hydroxylase levels were upregulated in sympathetic neurons, which were incubated with GBS-IgG, but not in those exposed to IgG from patients with CIDP or RRMS on messenger RNA and protein level. This indicates that the incubation with GBS-IgG stimulates the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in sympathetic neurons, which is the key enzyme for the synthesis of catecholamines in sympathetic neurons. It is known that during development, a proportion of sympathetic neurons can display a predominantly cholinergic phenotype by synthesizing acetylcholine instead of noradrenaline.

To ensure that IgG of patients with GBS caused the change in the noradrenaline synthesis, we used highly purified IgG fractions in which the removal of the nongammaglobulin protein fractions was confirmed by capillary electrophoresis, thus excluding any unspecific effect of other plasma proteins including complement. Furthermore, IgG from patients with other autoimmune-mediated neurological diseases did not show any changes in noradrenaline synthesis, which indicates that human IgG per se does not alter transmitter synthesis in sympathetic neurons.

### This Guillain-Barréwon' T Go away: chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy in an 18-year-old male… [^113E9afK]. publications.aap.org (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy is a rare diagnosis, encompassing a group of related neuropathies that share the characteristics of chronicity, demyelination, inflammation, and immune-mediation. It exists along a temporal continuum with its acute counterpart: the demyelinating form of Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a monophasic illness which typically resolves in the span of weeks. First line treatments of CIDP include corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and plasma exchange, although more aggressive presentations may require additional immunotherapy. We present a case of CIDP in an adolescent patient. As a disease most commonly seen in older adult populations, this case highlights how the expertise of adult specialists can be utilized during a pediatric admission to facilitate inpatient care and outpatient transition.
