## Question

Patient with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and being treated with rituximab and mycophenolate. Is this common for both medications to be used.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is common for both rituximab and mycophenolate mofetil to be used together in granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and under what circumstances that combination is appropriate or evidence-based. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard treatment phases in GPA and which agents are typically used for induction versus maintenance. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about rituximab and mycophenolate individually and whether they recommend combination therapy. Next, I will examine any direct evidence for rituximab plus mycophenolate, including retrospective data and meta-analyses. After that, I need to consider special scenarios where combination might be reasonable despite limited evidence. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with safety considerations and monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the treatment framework. GPA care is generally divided into induction of remission (typically 3–6 months) and maintenance of remission (often 18–24 months or longer), with rituximab or cyclophosphamide plus glucocorticoids as standard induction options, and rituximab, azathioprine, methotrexate, or mycophenolate as maintenance options depending on severity, relapse risk, and patient factors [^113DVJ1x] [^111E8wj3] [^113AkTxr].

> Now, I should verify the role of rituximab. Rituximab is a first-line induction agent for severe GPA and is also a preferred maintenance agent in many patients, particularly those with relapsing disease, PR3-ANCA positivity, or when steroid-sparing is important; fixed-interval rituximab regimens such as MAINRITSAN and RITAZAREM reduce relapse risk compared with azathioprine in randomized trials and are endorsed by contemporary guidelines [^113DVJ1x] [^113zQD3U] [^114bLZEP] [^1144Lrdi].

> Next, I should review mycophenolate's role. Mycophenolate mofetil is generally considered a less favored maintenance option after rituximab or cyclophosphamide induction, with higher relapse rates than azathioprine in some analyses; guidelines conditionally prefer methotrexate or azathioprine over mycophenolate for maintenance in severe GPA, though mycophenolate may still be used when those agents are contraindicated or not tolerated [^113zQD3U] [^114xHSdv]. Wait, let me verify the comparative efficacy signal: yes, ACR/VF notes higher relapse with mycophenolate versus azathioprine, which aligns with the conditional preference for azathioprine or methotrexate over mycophenolate in maintenance settings [^114xHSdv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about combination therapy. I need to check whether rituximab and mycophenolate are used together routinely. The standard approach is sequential: rituximab for induction and/or maintenance, or cyclophosphamide for induction followed by a maintenance agent; major guidelines do not recommend routine combination of rituximab with mycophenolate for induction or maintenance in GPA, and instead emphasize choosing one maintenance strategy and sticking to it with appropriate monitoring [^113DVJ1x] [^113zQD3U] [^113dSQC6].

> But wait, what if there is evidence for combination use in select contexts? Let me consider the retrospective data. A single-center study in relapsing GPA suggested that adding a conventional maintenance agent (azathioprine, methotrexate, or mycophenolate) to rituximab plus glucocorticoids reduced relapse compared with rituximab alone, without a clear increase in serious adverse events; however, this was observational, heterogeneous, and not a randomized comparison, so causality and generalizability are limited [^113m88pz]. I should double-check: yes, this is low-credibility, hypothesis-generating evidence rather than practice-changing data [^113m88pz].

> I will now examine whether any high-quality trials or meta-analyses support rituximab plus mycophenolate. I need to ensure I'm not missing a randomized study; on review, contemporary randomized maintenance trials compare rituximab with azathioprine (e.g. MAINRITSAN, RITAZAREM) and do not evaluate rituximab plus mycophenolate, and meta-analytic data for mycophenolate in AAV focus on induction or maintenance monotherapy rather than combination with rituximab, so there is no robust RCT basis for routine rituximab–mycophenolate co-administration in GPA [^1144Lrdi] [^114UACSa] [^111D7R4g].

> Let me consider special scenarios where combination might be reasonable despite limited evidence. Refractory disease, overlapping autoimmune features, or patient-specific contraindications to standard agents could prompt individualized regimens, and case series occasionally describe rituximab combined with other immunosuppressants in complex presentations; however, these are exceptions and should be framed as off-label, carefully monitored strategies rather than standard care [^1128xxJM]. I should confirm that guidelines advise switching agents rather than layering in refractory cases; yes, ACR/VF recommends switching rather than combining when disease is refractory to rituximab or cyclophosphamide, underscoring that dual therapy is not the default approach [^114Bu31B] [^112KY99P].

> Next, I should review safety implications if combination is used. Concurrent B-cell depletion with rituximab and antiproliferative therapy with mycophenolate increases immunosuppression and infection risk; real-world rituximab cohorts show meaningful serious infection rates, and adding mycophenolate would be expected to compound that risk, so vigilant infection surveillance, vaccination, and immunoglobulin monitoring are prudent if combination is unavoidable [^111LhXUr] [^112zDW6X] [^116rPSf4]. Hold on, I should verify whether guidelines address hypogammaglobulinemia with rituximab; yes, ACR/VF suggests IVIG in selected patients with hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent infections on rituximab, highlighting the infection risk management framework clinicians should apply [^112UZh9v].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Routine use of rituximab plus mycophenolate is not common or guideline-supported in GPA; standard practice is to use rituximab alone for induction and/or maintenance, or cyclophosphamide for induction followed by a single maintenance agent such as rituximab, azathioprine, or methotrexate, with mycophenolate reserved for intolerance or contraindications to preferred agents and not as a routine combination partner with rituximab [^113DVJ1x] [^113zQD3U] [^113dSQC6]. Combination therapy may be considered in select refractory or atypical cases, but evidence is limited, and if used, it should be individualized with close monitoring for efficacy and infection [^113m88pz] [^1128xxJM].

---

It is **not standard practice** to use rituximab and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) together for granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). Rituximab is a **first-line induction and maintenance therapy** for GPA, while MMF is generally reserved for patients who cannot tolerate or have contraindications to standard agents [^113DVJ1x] [^114xHSdv]. Combination therapy is not recommended by major guidelines and may increase infection risk; if used, it should be in specialized circumstances with close monitoring [^113zQD3U] [^116rPSf4].

## Current standard of care for GPA

Current guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European Alliance of Associations of Rheumatology (EULAR) provide clear recommendations for GPA management:

- **Induction therapy**: Rituximab or cyclophosphamide combined with glucocorticoids is recommended for induction of remission in severe GPA [^116tUvsp] [^111PoL3s].

- **Maintenance therapy**: Rituximab is preferred for maintenance of remission, with azathioprine or methotrexate as alternatives [^113DVJ1x] [^1154H5yQ].

- **Non-severe disease**: Methotrexate is conditionally recommended for induction in non-severe GPA, with rituximab or cyclophosphamide reserved for severe disease [^112NwxtW] [^116kgAFw].

---

## Role of mycophenolate mofetil in GPA

MMF is an immunosuppressive agent primarily used in transplantation and certain autoimmune diseases. In GPA, MMF is **not a first-line agent** for induction or maintenance of remission. It may be considered in specific scenarios, such as:

- **Contraindications**: Patients who cannot tolerate or have contraindications to standard agents like methotrexate, azathioprine, or rituximab [^114xHSdv].

- **Non-severe disease**: MMF may be considered in non-severe GPA, particularly in patients with renal involvement, although it is associated with higher relapse rates compared to other agents [^114UACSa] [^114xHSdv].

---

## Evidence and guidelines regarding combination therapy

There is **limited evidence** supporting the routine combination of rituximab and MMF in GPA. Major guidelines do not recommend this approach, and the available evidence suggests potential risks:

- **RITUXVAS trial**: Rituximab combined with cyclophosphamide was studied, but not rituximab with MMF [^113VfNdV].

- **Retrospective studies**: Some retrospective data suggest that adding a conventional maintenance agent (including MMF) to rituximab may reduce relapse risk, but these findings are not supported by robust randomized controlled trials [^113m88pz].

- **Infection risk**: Combination immunosuppression increases the risk of infections, including serious infections, which is a significant concern in GPA patients [^116rPSf4].

---

## Clinical scenarios where combination therapy might be considered

While not standard, combination therapy with rituximab and MMF may be considered in **specific clinical scenarios**:

- **Refractory disease**: Patients with refractory or relapsing GPA who have failed standard monotherapies [^notfound].

- **Individualized treatment**: Cases where individualized treatment decisions are made based on patient-specific factors, disease severity, and comorbidities [^notfound].

- **Clinical trials**: Participation in clinical trials investigating novel combination therapies.

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

If rituximab and MMF are used together, **careful monitoring is essential**:

- **Infection surveillance**: Regular monitoring for infections, including serious infections, due to increased immunosuppression [^116rPSf4].

- **Laboratory monitoring**: Frequent assessment of renal function, liver function, and hematologic parameters.

- **Vaccinations**: Ensure up-to-date vaccinations, including influenza, pneumococcal, and COVID-19 vaccines, to mitigate infection risk [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In summary, it is **not common or standard practice** to use rituximab and MMF together for GPA. Rituximab remains a first-line therapy for induction and maintenance, while MMF is reserved for specific situations. Combination therapy should be approached cautiously, with careful consideration of risks and benefits, and under close clinical supervision.

### Rituximab with or without a conventional maintenance agent in the treatment of relapsing granulomatosis with polyangiitis (wegener' s): a retrospective single-center study [^113m88pz]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of rituximab (RTX) induction therapy and the duration of remission, when RTX is used with or without a conventional maintenance agent, in a cohort of patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) (GPA).

Methods

This was a retrospective, single-center study of patients with relapsing GPA treated with at least 1 course of RTX (4 weekly doses of 375 mg/m² intravenously [IV] or 2 fixed doses of 1,000 mg IV 2 weeks apart). Complete remission was defined as the absence of disease activity measured by a Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Wegener's granulomatosis of 0 and not qualified by the prednisone dosage at the time.

Results

Eighty-nine patients achieved remission after their first course of RTX and were not re-treated preemptively with RTX to maintain remission of their disease during followup. Among these patients, relapse-free survival was significantly higher in those who received a conventional maintenance agent (azathioprine, methotrexate, or mycophenolate mofetil) in conjunction with RTX and glucocorticoids (n = 47) than in those who received no additional immunosuppressive agent (n = 42) (P = 0.04). The hazard ratio of relapse in those receiving a maintenance agent was 0.53 (95% confidence interval 0.29–0.97). Serious adverse events did not differ between the 2 groups. Within a subset of 15 patients in the cohort who were relapse free 2 years after 1 course of RTX, remissions endured for 2–6 years in 8 patients.

Conclusion

RTX is an effective remission-inducing agent in GPA. The addition of a conventional maintenance agent to RTX and glucocorticoids decreased the incidence of relapse and did not result in a higher incidence of adverse events.

INTRODUCTION

The antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–associated vasculitides (AAVs) granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) are rare, potentially organ‐ and life‐threatening, systemic autoimmune small vessel vasculitides. GPA and MPA are associated with the presence of ANCAs against proteinase 3 (PR3) or myeloperoxidase (MPO). Pediatric patients with GPA or MPA share many signs and symptoms of these diseases with adult patients. Childhood‐onset disease carries considerable disease‐related morbidity and mortality, mainly as a result of progressive renal failure or aggressive respiratory involvement.

The conventional treatment for severe GPA or MPA in patients is remission induction with cyclophosphamide (CYC) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in combination with glucocorticoids (GCs), usually followed by maintenance with azathioprine (AZA) or methotrexate. CYC in combination with GCs does not prevent frequent relapses in the majority of children with GPA or MPA, and this treatment is associated with a significant toxicity risk. Relapses may occur more frequently in pediatric patients treated with MMF than in those treated with CYC. Pediatric patients with GPA or MPA therefore have major unmet needs, including the lack of improvement in remission rates as well as inability to prevent flares and reduce the toxic effects of GCs and immunosuppressive therapies. Because children and adolescents require treatment during critical periods of growth and development and require treatment for a longer duration than adult patients, it is important to have alternatives to GCs and toxic immunosuppressants.

There is strong evidence to indicate that B cells play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of GPA and MPA. B cells may contribute to GPA and MPA pathogenesis by acting as antigen‐presenting cells, through the production of various cytokines or through ANCA autoantibody production by their progenitor cells. Rituximab (RTX) is an anti‐CD20 monoclonal antibody that targets and depletes CD20+ B cells. Thus, RTX may disrupt the critical functions of B cells in the pathogenesis and progression of AAVs. The efficacy and safety of RTX as remission‐induction treatment in adult patients with severe GPA or MPA were demonstrated in the Rituximab in ANCA‐Associated Vasculitis (RAVE) trial. RTX, in combination with GCs, was approved worldwide for the treatment of GPA and MPA in adult patients. Recently, the Rituximab versus Azathioprine in ANCA‐Associated Vasculitis trial demonstrated the efficacy of RTX for remission maintenance in adult patients with GPA or MPA, leading to regulatory approvals in the US and European Union.

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) — remission maintenance after severe disease favors conventional immunosuppressants over rituximab or mepolizumab and individualizes glucocorticoid (GC) duration. After remission with cyclophosphamide therapy, methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil is conditionally recommended over rituximab for maintenance; more generally after remission, these same agents are conditionally recommended over mepolizumab for maintenance; and the duration of GC therapy should be guided by the patient's clinical condition, values, and preferences.

ANCA vasculitis — treatment of relapse states to treat severe relapse according to the same initial-therapy guidelines (1C) and to treat other relapses by reinstituting or increasing non–cyclophosphamide immunosuppression, including instituting or increasing corticosteroids with or without azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (2C). The commentary adds that "rituximab may be more effective than cyclophosphamide for remission induction in patients with relapsing disease", that "another reason to favor rituximab… would be reduction in cyclophosphamide exposure and side effects", that "cyclophosphamide generally should not be used for remission induction in selected patients with nonsevere disease", that "limited data with azathioprine for remission induction… did not support efficacy", that "we recommend use of combined therapy as use of corticosteroids alone have not been effective… for active granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis", and that "methotrexate can also be used for remission induction of nonsevere relapses in patients without contraindications".

Table 3
Therapeutic procedures, length of follow-up, BCVA, and outcomes in 22 patients with GPA and ocular manifestations

BCVA best-corrected visual acuity, CYC cyclophosphamide, GC glucocorticoids, GPA granulomatosis with polyangiitis, iv intravenous, MMF mycophenolate mofetil, MTX methotrexate, o oral, RTX rituximab, sc subcutaneous

To achieve remission induction, a conventional daily treatment with oral GC (0.5–1 mg/kg body weight) and oral CYC (2 mg/kg body weight) was given to 9 patients, and intravenous pulse methylprednisolone (usually 1–3 g) combined with intravenous pulse CYC (15–20 mg/kg body weight every 3 weeks) to 2 patients with organ- or life-threatening disease. Mesna (2-mercaptoethane sulfonate sodium) was added to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis from CYC, with patients simultaneously receiving generous hydration. Five patients (including patients 7, 10, and 22 in Table 1, for whom the preservation of fertility was prioritized) received the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab (RTX: intravenous infusions of 375 mg/m² weekly for a total of four doses) instead of CYC as the primary drug for remission induction, combined with oral GC. In 2 patients with an orbital mass and in 3 patients with retro-orbital pseudotumor, the disease was unresponsive to CYC. A switch to GC plus RTX resulted in better efficacy, but in one of the patients orbital decompression and the debulking of granulomas became necessary to relieve the compressive optic neuropathy. Three patients were treated with subcutaneous injections of methotrexate (MTX, 0.3 mg/kg body weight per week) in conjunction with GC and 3 patients received a combination of GC plus oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, 1 g twice daily). No patient underwent plasma exchange or received high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins, and no patient had disease considered initially refractory to treatment. Coexistent infectious diseases were ruled out before starting the administration of GC and immunosuppressive agents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Patient and public involvement statement

This research was done without patient involvement. Patients were not invited to comment on the study design and were not consulted to develop patient-relevant outcomes or interpret the results. Patients were not invited to contribute to the writing or editing of this document for readability or accuracy.

Search strategy

We searched the databases at PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar for RCTs comparing the therapeutic efficacy of MMF with that of CYC in patients with AAV. On PubMed and Cochrane Library, we used the terms 'ANCA' or 'antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody' or 'MPA' or 'microscopic polyangiitis' or 'GPA' or 'granulomatosis with polyangiitis' or 'Wegener's granulomatosis' and 'MMF' or 'mycophenolate mofetil' and 'CYC' or 'cyclophosphamide'. On Google Scholar, we used the terms 'ANCA-associated vasculitis', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'cyclophosphamide', 'randomised', '–rituximab' and '–TNF'. We imposed no language restrictions, but excluded data available only in abstracts or unpublished studies. The searches were performed three times to identify articles published between 1 January 1990 and 1 September 2019. Final searches were performed on 15 September 2019. We followed the guidelines in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement.

Study selection

We included original articles (excluding reviews), RCTs comparing the therapeutic efficacies between MMF and CYC, titles or abstracts containing keywords used in search engines and patients with AAV diagnosed according to definitions from the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference. We excluded studies that provided no data on the 6-month remission rates. We ensured that studies published by the same author(s) did not have duplicate patients.

Validity and quality assessment

Two authors (KK and TM) independently checked and selected all the references. We assessed the risk of bias according to RoB 2: a revised tool for assessing the risk of bias to randomised trials. We also assessed the symmetry of funnel plots for publication bias.

EGPA initial therapy in active, nonsevere disease — For patients with active, nonsevere eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), "we conditionally recommend initiating treatment with methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoids over cyclophosphamide or rituximab and glucocorticoids". The guideline notes that "rituximab may be considered if other agents are not effective in controlling active, nonsevere disease, or if the patient has nonsevere vasculitis… and is positive for ANCA", and that "Cyclophosphamide should be avoided when treating active, nonsevere disease due to its toxicity and is the least preferred option in this setting".

ABSTRACT

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV) are characterized by small-vessel necrotizing inflammation, and prior to the advent of immunosuppressive therapy frequently had a fatal outcome. Treatment has transformed AAV into a relapsing/remitting disease with increased drug-related toxicities and organ damage. The use of glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide and immunosuppressives (including azathioprine, mycophenolate and methotrexate) was optimized through a sequence of clinical trials establishing a standard of care against which subsequent targeted therapies could be developed. Improved understanding of pathophysiology has supported the development of B-cell depletion and complement inhibition in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis, and interleukin 5 inhibition for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, leading to the approval of newer agents for these conditions. There has been an increased attention on minimizing the adverse effects of treatment and on understanding the epidemiology of comorbidities in AAV. This review will focus on recent evidence from clinical trials, especially with respect to glucocorticoids, avacopan, plasma exchange, rituximab and mepolizumab, and their interpretation in the 2022 management recommendations by the European League of Associations of Rheumatology.

### Mycophenolate mofetil to treat wegener's granulomatosis and… [^114x1xBS]. ClinicalTrials (1999). Low credibility.

The more severe the involvement, the more likely the disease will be life-threatening. Standard treatment consists of combination drug therapy with prednisone and a cytotoxic agent-usually cyclophosphamide or methotrexate. However, some patients in whom this treatment is initially successful have a disease relapse; other patients cannot take the medications because of other health problems or because of severe side effects of the drugs. MPM is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to prevent kidney transplant rejection. It is chemically similar to another cytotoxic drug called azathioprine, which has been beneficial in maintaining remission in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis who have been treated successfully with cyclophosphamide. Because MPM is more effective than azathioprine in preventing organ rejection, it may also prove beneficial as a second-line treatment for Wegener's granulomatosis.

In both cases, the prednisone will be reduced gradually and discontinued if the disease improves significantly. MPM therapy will continue for at least 2 years. If after 2 years the disease remains in remission, the MPM dose will be gradually reduced and then stopped. If active disease recurs while on MPM therapy, the treatment plan will likely be changed. The new regimen will be determined by the severity of disease, other medical conditions, and history of side effects to previous medications. Patients will be followed at the NIH clinic every month for the first 3 months on MPM and then every 3 months for another 18 months. Those whose disease has remained in remission and have stopped all medications will then be followed every 6 months for 4 visits. The follow-up visits will include a physical examination, blood draws, and, if needed, X-rays. Visits may be scheduled more frequently if medically indicated. Drug: Mycophenolate Mofetil

- 98-I-0092.

Patients with inactive disease who are receiving treatment with CYC and prednisone in a manner similar to #76-I-0042 will be eligible if they have a contraindication to receiving MTX and have been in remission for less 3 months. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Evidence of active infection which, in the judgment of the investigator, is of greater danger to the patient than the underlying vasculitis. In those instances in which infection cannot be ruled out by gram stain and culture of secretions or collections of fluid in involved organs, it may be necessary to obtain a biopsy of the affected tissue for microbiological and histopathological studies.

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) — remission induction for active, nonsevere disease emphasizes mepolizumab plus glucocorticoids (GCs) over conventional immunosuppressants, and starting an immunosuppressant plus GCs rather than GCs alone or cyclophosphamide/rituximab. Specifically, initiating mepolizumab and GCs is conditionally recommended over methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil and GCs; initiating methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil and GCs is conditionally recommended over GCs alone; and initiating methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil and GCs is conditionally recommended over cyclophosphamide or rituximab and GCs.

### Lung involvement in childhood onset granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^113hN6oC]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment

Treatment requires a remission induction phase, followed by maintenance therapy. Standard treatment of GPA has primarily consisted of glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide. Several other immunosuppressive agents have been used, in monotherapy or in combination with glucocorticoids, including methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate, cyclosporine, colchicines, etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, rituximab. Remission induction is mainly based on the use of glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide; cyclophosphamide can be administered either orally or with intravenous pulses and should be withdrawn when remission is achieved. Remission maintenance therapy, which should last at least 18–24 months, is usually based on the introduction of azathioprine or methotrexate, with concomitant tapering of glucocorticoids.

Other therapeutic strategies have been used in severe and refractory cases. Intravenous immunoglobulin administration has been used as adjunctive therapy in AAV patients with refractory or relapsing disease, even if 11,9% of patients presented serious adverse events. In severe cases of alveolar haemorrage, together with aggressive immunosuppressive therapy, plasmapheresis has been used. The use of plasma exchange in patients with creatinine levels > 5,8 mg/dl was proved to be more effective than intravenous methylprednisolone in preventing end-stage renal disease at 12 months, but no difference was observed in survival rates and incidence of adverse events. Even if plasma exchange is usually reserved for refractory disease and life-threatening conditions, it has been proposed also for induction of remission in less severe cases. The PEXIVAS study will better define the benefits of plasma exchange in AAV. Kidney involvement may require dialysis and kidney transplant.

### Efficacy and safety of rituximab in the treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^115nXxUG]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Between 2003 and 2017, 140 patients with EGPA had been reviewed by the clinic. Seventy-two were treated with rituximab, but only 69 patients were considered for this analysis (table 1). Two were excluded due to follow up in other hospitals, and one because he had received alemtuzumab 1 month before rituximab.

Table 1
Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of 69 patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis treated with rituximab

The median length of treatment (time between first and last infusion during the follow-up period) was 23 months (IQR 12.5–24.0 months) and the survival rate of rituximab was 84.8% at 12 months and 68.4% at 24 months. During the follow-up period, the median cumulative dose of rituximab was 2 g (IQR 2.0–2.0 g) for induction and 3 g (IQR 2.0–3.0) for maintenance.

Response

Figure 1 describes the percentage of responders, partial responders and non-responders. Patients who discontinued treatment were only considered in the categories until 6 months following last treatment. Moreover, at the time of the analysis, some patients still receiving treatment had insufficient treatment duration to be considered in the analysis at 18 months (5 patients) and at 24 months (10 patients).

Figure 1
Treatment response by percentage of patients divided by three categories: no response, partial response and response. The total number of patients considered by months are presented over columns.

Five patients received a single course of rituximab. Three had no response and were not followed further, and two, who responded, received maintenance treatment with mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone or prednisolone alone. Before 12 months, a further five discontinued rituximab due to an insufficient treatment response, and before 18 months, a further five discontinued rituximab with sustained response in four, and an insufficient response in one. The rates of discontinuations due to insufficient response were slightly higher than the rates of discontinuation due to good response.

### Treatment approaches to granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis [^113kPoUV]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

We have made significant headway in our ability to induce and maintain remission in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis. With increased understanding of the pathogenesis of antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitides (AAV), therapeutic targets have been identified and studied in clinical trials. From initial induction strategies including glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide, we have discovered effective induction regimens with rituximab and complement inhibition that can significantly decrease the glucocorticoid cumulative doses in patients with AAV. There are many trials underway evaluating management strategies for refractory patients and exploring new and old therapies that may help to continuously improve outcomes for patients with AAV.

### A rare case report of polyangiitis overlap syndrome: granulomatosis with polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^117UeK7R]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Several polyangiitis overlap syndromes have been identified, however, to our knowledge, there are few reports of an overlap syndrome involving both GPA and EGPA. It is essential to identify patients with GPA/EGPA overlap syndrome because treatment modalities differ for GPA and EGPA.

Uematsu et al. diagnosed overlap syndrome with GPA and EGPA in a patient because of the combination of peripheral eosinophilia and asthmatic symptoms with an elevated serum PR3-ANCA level and negative MPO-ANCA titers. Skin biopsy revealed focal panarteritis with necrotizing vasculitis. Additionally, the patient developed nasal obstruction, epistaxis and microscopic hematuria, which are much more commonly seen in patients with GPA than in patients with EGPA.

Surendran et al. identified overlap syndrome in a patient with similar features including the presence of polyarthritis, pan-sinusitis, c-ANCA positivity, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, and mononeuritis multiplex arguing for both EGPA and GPA. The presence of a history of asthma and tissue eosinophilia favored EGPA, while the presence of nasal septal perforation and eye proptosis favored GPA.

The clinical findings most commonly featured throughout the identified overlap syndromes were a constellation of characteristic end organ manifestations in the lungs, kidneys, and sinuses plus eosinophilia (whether peripheral or tissue).

The treatment of both GPA and EGPA depends upon disease severity or risk stratification. As a general rule, therapeutic agents used for the management of GPA and EGPA have a very real risk of adverse effects and must be used with care even as the clinician recognizes the life-threatening nature of the vasculitis itself. For patients with more mild disease, oral glucocorticoids may be sufficient, whereas patients with generalized active disease will usually require therapy with cytotoxic agents such as methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil. For patients with GPA, rituximab has been shown to be effective in generalized active and severe or life-threatening disease (e.g. alveolar hemorrhage, cardiac involvement, CNS involvement or fulminant renal failure). For patients with EGPA, anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibodies have recently been shown to have efficacy. Specifically, mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to IL-5, has been evaluated in patients with EGPA in a randomized trial and multiple case reports. In a multicenter trial, 44% of mepolizumab- treated subjects were able to taper glucocorticoids compared with 7% of subjects taking placebo.

### Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and intravenous immunoglobulins: a case series and review of the literature [^116Howre]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis or disease, is a systemic, necrotizing small-vessel vasculitis, belonging to the group of anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody vasculitis. The therapeutic strategy includes, in most cases, corticosteroids associated, at least in severe forms of the disease, with immunosuppressive agents: cyclophosphamide and rituximab to induce remission, methotrexate, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil to prevent relapses. Intravenous immunoglobulins represent an alternative adjuvant therapy. We described 5 cases of patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis treated with monthly high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins (500mg/kg/daily for 3 consecutive days for 9months). No patients experienced adverse reactions, and 4 patients (80%) achieved a complete remission after 9 courses of this therapy, which was maintained also 3months later, although we are unable to determine whether improvement in outcomes was a direct result of the IVIG. We also discussed the beneficial effects of intravenous immunoglobulins in patients suffering from granulomatosis with polyangiitis, reporting the previously published data.

### Validation of the EULAR / ERA-EDTA recommendations for the management of ANCA-associated vasculitis by disease content experts [^114NAHxj]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

The European League Against Rheumatism recommendations for the management of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis have been recently published. Unique to recommendation development, they were also voted on by members of a learned society. This paper explores the wider validity of the recommendations among people who self-identify as clinicians caring for patients with vasculitis. In addition to the task force, a learned society (European Vasculitis Society — EUVAS) was invited, through online survey, to rate independently the strength of evidence of each recommendation to obtain an indication of the agreement among the final target audience and ultimate end-users of the recommendations. The survey took place in June 2015. Of the 158 EUVAS members surveyed, there were 88 responses (55.7%). There was a large degree of agreement in the voting patterns between EUVAS survey participants and task force members. Notable exceptions were lower grades for the recommendation of the use of rituximab for remission induction in patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and for methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil as remission maintenance agents in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis/microscopic polyangiitis by EUVAS members. These results are encouraging and suggest that the voting patterns of the task force are representative of the wider vasculitis community. We recommend future recommendations adopt this approach for data/expert-based treatment guidelines, especially for multisystem diseases.

### Update on maintenance therapy for granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis [^116UZevb]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides are a group of rare systemic diseases. The past several years have seen major therapeutic advances in the treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). The success rate in induction of remission is high, but reducing the high incidence of relapses remains a therapeutic challenge.

Recent Findings

Studies have shown no improvement in relapse rates in GPA and MPA over the past 2 decades. This has prompted a recent focus on therapeutic strategies to maintain remission in these relapsing diseases. Low-dose rituximab (RTX) at fixed intervals has been shown superior to azathioprine for maintenance of remission. Despite this advance, longer follow-up periods have shown late-stage relapses with withdrawal of therapy suggesting a possible need for longer treatment regimens. Evaluation of prognostic indicators is also helpful in stratifying patients who might be more likely to relapse or to respond to a particular therapy.

Summary

Results from recent research have significantly advanced our approach to prevention of relapses in GPA and MPA. Newer maintenance agents have shown benefit in maintenance of remission and relapse-free survival.

### The use of ECMO in pediatric granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^113VfNdV]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Immunosuppressive treatment for ANCA vasculitis mainly involves two stages: induction therapy for the first 3–6 months to induce remission followed by maintenance therapy for the next 2–4 years with the aim of preventing relapses. For patients with ANCA vasculitis with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis or alveolar hemorrhage, pulse steroid treatment with IV methylprednisolone is often used for three days, as done with our patient. Previously, the standard of care for induction therapy involved glucocorticoids in combination with cyclophosphamide. However, given the toxicity profile of cyclophosphamide, rituximab has been studied as an alternative agent in adults and is increasingly being utilized and preferred (dose: 375 mg/m² of body surface area per week for 4 weeks). In particular, two important randomized control trials have been conducted: the RAVE and RITUXIVAS trials. The RAVE trial enrolled patients with new and relapsing ANCA vasculitis. One arm received cyclophosphamide and the other received rituximab. The end point was tapering off steroids by 6 months. Rituximab was found to be non-inferior to cyclophosphamide in reaching this goal. However, this study did not include patients requiring renal replacement therapy. The RITUXIVAS trial only included patients with newly diagnosed ANCA vasculitis and included those with renal involvement. Patients received either glucocorticoids plus rituximab with two IV doses of cyclophosphamide or IV cyclophosphamide for three to six months followed by azathioprine. The end points were sustained remission rates at 12 months and severe adverse events. Once again, rituximab was not found to be inferior. Thus, rituximab is now often preferred in patients with relapsing disease, refractory disease, and contraindications to cyclophosphamide. In addition to rituximab, there are several other induction treatment options being examined such as mycophenolate mofetil, combining cyclophosphamide and rituximab, and utilizing complement inhibitors. As described above, our patient received rituximab in addition to glucocorticoids as part of his induction therapy. Although the PEXIVAS study demonstrated that plasmapheresis has not been shown to reduce the incidence of death or end stage renal disease, given our patient's acute decompensation, the decision was made to proceed with plasmapheresis. Plasmapheresis, cyclophosphamide, and IVIG were subsequently added given his ongoing clinical decline, as others have done in severe renal/life-threatening disease.

### Seven clinical conundrums in the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis [^113oAQ4j]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis are two autoimmune diseases characterised by necrotising small-vessel vasculitis and presence of antineutrophil cytoplasm autoantibodies (ANCA). Current immunosuppressive regimes that combine cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids have dramatically improved the outcome for these patients. However, these treatments are associated with toxic effects and do not lead to permanent remission in the majority of cases. Newer approaches have been sought during the last 15 years, with improvement in medication protocols and inclusion of novel therapies. This review develops on seven clinical conundrums of evidence-based therapeutic strategies for ANCA-vasculitis, posed as questions on aspects such as the role of established drugs in both remission induction and maintenance: glucocorticoids (and its duration), oral cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, TNF-α blockers, plasma exchange, mycophenolate mofetil, plus one related to newer developments in treatment with agents blocking the complement system and the possible role of sequential or combined therapies, mainly directed against B cells.

### Long-term safety of rituximab in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and in microscopic polyangiitis [^111LhXUr]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study reports long‐term safety data following treatment with rituximab in 97 patients with GPA or MPA in a prospective observational manner outside of a controlled clinical trial and in a real‐world setting. The primary safety outcome in this analysis was the incidence of serious infections, an identified risk with rituximab. Overall, 14.4% of patients experienced a serious infection, with an IR of 7.11 per 100 PYs. No patients withdrew from the study or had dose modifications due to infections, suggesting that, in general, such infections were medically manageable and resolved with standard treatment. These results are consistent with those in patients with GPA or MPA treated with 1 course (≤ 1 month) of rituximab for induction of remission of vasculitis. Despite the difference in indication, these data are also consistent with results from the Sunstone registry (IR of 7.6 per 100 PYs), in which 989 patients with moderate‐to‐severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were followed up for up to 5 years (total of 3,844 PYs) in a real‐world setting. The incidence of serious infections in the current analysis did not increase over time or with an increasing number of infusions of rituximab, suggesting that long‐term, repeated treatment does not increase the risk of serious infections.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of abatacept for the treatment of relapsing, nonsevere granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^1138NzWt]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of abatacept to placebo for the treatment of relapsing, non-severe granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA).

Methods

In this multicenter trial, eligible patients with relapsing, non-severe GPA were randomized to receive abatacept 125 mg subcutaneously once a week or placebo, both together with prednisone 30 mg/day (or equivalent), tapered and discontinued at week 12. Patients already taking methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate, or leflunomide continued this medication at a stable dose. Patients achieving remission remained on their randomized assignment until relapse, early termination, or the common close date 12 months after enrollment of the last patient. Those who had a non-severe relapse, non-severe worsening, or were not in remission by month 6 had the option to receive open-label abatacept. The primary endpoint was the rate of treatment failure, defined as relapse, disease worsening, or failure to achieve a BVAS/WG = 0 or 1 by 6 months.

Results

Sixty-five patients were randomized, 34 received abatacept and 31 placebo. No statistical difference in the treatment failure rate was found between those who received abatacept compared to placebo (p = 0.853). Treatment with abatacept did not demonstrate any statistical difference from placebo in key secondary endpoints, including time to full remission (BVAS/WG = 0), duration of glucocorticoid-free remission, relapse severity, prevention of damage, or patient-reported quality-of life outcomes. There was no difference in the frequency or severity of adverse events between treatment arms, including infection.

Conclusions

In patients with relapsing, non-severe GPA abatacept did not reduce the risk of relapse, severe worsening, or failure to achieve remission.

Treatment regimens

All 25 patients completed the per‐protocol RTX regimen (infusions of 375 mg/m² once per week for 4 weeks) and also completed the 6‐month remission‐induction phase (Supplementary Figure 2, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology website at). A total of 24 patients completed ≥ 18 months of follow‐up; 1 patient withdrew from the study around month 16 due to either an administrative reason or another reason, and was transferred back to a local hospital for care. Eight patients discontinued participation between month 18 and the common closeout date, primarily due to either an administrative reason or some other reason, such as a physician or family decision or transfer to adult care services for their GPA or MPA. There were no withdrawals due to AEs. During the overall study period, patients received 4–28 infusions of RTX. The mean number of infusions per patient was 8. The majority of patients (68%) were followed up for 18 months to 3 years, and 6 patients (24%) were followed up for 3–4.5 years. Overall, the total duration of observation was 61.1 patient‐years of follow‐up.

In total, 17 patients (68%) received additional RTX treatment at or after month 6 until the common closeout date, the dosing of which was variable and determined at the discretion of the treating physician. Among these 17 patients, 5 received infusions of RTX (375 mg/m²) approximately every 6 months administered once weekly for 4 weeks, and 5 received 1 infusion of RTX (375 mg/m²) every 6 months; a further 7 patients received other, varied doses of RTX within individualized regimens. A total of 9 patients (36%) received ≥ 1 additional immunosuppressive therapy for GPA or MPA between months 6 and 18 (Supplementary Table 1, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology website at).

### Long-term maintenance rituximab for ANCA-associated vasculitis: relapse and infection prediction models [^116rPSf4]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is an organ and life-threatening multisystem autoimmune disease that often follows a relapsing and remitting course. B cell-derived ANCAs are implicated in the pathogenesis and evidence from randomized trials supports the use of rituximab (RTX), an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that depletes B cells, as both a remission induction and maintenance agent. Fixed-interval repeat-dose RTX infusions over a 2-year period is a commonly used approach to maintain remission and prevent relapses. However, after a maintenance course of RTX, relapses occur on cessation of therapy, and further dosing is considered where the benefits of relapse prevention must be weighed against the risk of RTX-induced immunodeficiency and susceptibility to infections.

Patient-specific and disease-specific characteristics exist that can influence an individual's risk of relapse and risk of infectious complications. For instance, a consistent finding from observational studies and clinical trials is that having circulating ANCAs against proteinase 3 (PR3) rather than myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a significant risk for relapsing disease. The disease phenotype also influences relapse risk as patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) tend to have more relapses than patients with microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), as do those with involvement of the upper and lower airways. In addition, patients who have had previous relapses, tend to relapse again, and some studies have shown increased relapse risk in patients with better renal function, persistent ANCA positivity and nasal colonization of Staphylococcus Aureus. Prior and current immunosuppressive treatments, both in terms of the agent used and the duration of therapy, may also influence relapse risk.

Elderly patients are at increased risk of infectious complications associated with immunosuppressive therapy, as are those with impaired renal function, lung damage and diabetes. An over-suppressed immune system may be indicated by leukopenia and hypogammaglobulinaemia; the former being more commonly associated with CYC use, whereas the latter has been seen in patients with AAV, both prior to and in association with RTX use. Overall immunosuppressive burden including the use of other agents such as prednisolone, CYC and mycophenolate may contribute to hypogammaglobulinaemia. However, there is not a clear association between cumulative RTX exposure, low immunoglobulin levels and infection risk, suggesting complex interplay of many patient, disease and treatment related factors. This heterogeneity between individual patients makes predicting the occurrence and severity of RTX-induced hypogammaglobulinaemia challenging.

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) — management of relapse differentiates severe from nonsevere manifestations and prioritizes rituximab for severe re-induction and mepolizumab additions for nonsevere disease while on other agents. For severe relapse after remission induction with cyclophosphamide, rituximab is conditionally recommended over cyclophosphamide for re-induction, and for severe relapse after remission induction with rituximab, rituximab is conditionally recommended over switching to cyclophosphamide. For nonsevere relapse (asthma and/or sinonasal disease) while receiving methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil, adding mepolizumab is conditionally recommended over switching to another agent; for nonsevere relapse while on low-dose GCs and no other therapy, adding mepolizumab is conditionally recommended over adding methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil; and for patients with high serum IgE levels and nonsevere relapse while on methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil, adding mepolizumab is conditionally recommended over adding omalizumab.

### Long-term safety of rituximab in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and in microscopic polyangiitis [^114cpdC7]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) are 2 forms of systemic vasculitis that affect small to medium‐sized blood vessels and are characterized by the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs). If left untreated, GPA and MPA can result in organ damage or death. Serious infections, cardiovascular disease, and malignancy are important causes of morbidity and death in patients with GPA or MPA.

Significance & Innovations

This study reports long‐term safety data following treatment with rituximab in 97 patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) in a prospective observational manner outside of a controlled clinical trial and in a real‐world setting.
In patients with GPA or MPA, long‐term treatment with the anti‐CD20 antibody rituximab was consistent with that of rituximab administered for shorter durations and with rituximab's known safety profile in other autoimmune diseases for which it is approved.
The findings in this study provide clinicians with long‐term, practice‐level safety data for rituximab in the treatment of GPA or MPA.

Prior to regulatory approvals in 2011 for the use of rituximab in combination with glucocorticoids for the treatment of patients with GPA or MPA, the standard‐of‐care treatment (since the 1970s) for severe disease was cyclophosphamide in combination with glucocorticoids. Rituximab is an anti‐CD20 monoclonal antibody that targets and depletes CD20+ B cells and is approved for the treatment of GPA and MPA. Rituximab, in combination with glucocorticoids, is recommended by both the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology as an alternative to cyclophosphamide for induction of remission of new‐onset, organ‐threatening, or life‐threatening GPA or MPA. Rituximab is also effective for the maintenance of remission in patients with GPA or MPA.

Given the improved survival of patients with GPA or MPA over the past decades and the potential short‐ and long‐term toxicities associated with standard‐of‐care treatments, the Rituximab in ANCA‐Associated Vasculitis registry (RaVeR) was developed to address the need for data on the long‐term outcomes of patients with GPA or MPA treated with rituximab and other immunosuppressive therapies in routine clinical practice. The primary objective of this study was to characterize the long‐term safety of rituximab, including repeated administrations, in the treatment of GPA or MPA in a real‐world setting (observational cohort).

### Validation of the EULAR / ERA-EDTA recommendations for the management of ANCA-associated vasculitis by disease content experts [^113WbS9T]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Results

The survey took place in June 2015. The first email message was sent on 4 June 2015 with a link to an online survey. Two reminder emails were sent on 9 and 22 June. Of the 158 EUVAS members surveyed there were 88 responses (55.7%). The members were from 29 countries, distributed across the continents of Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania and South America.

The most popular (mode) vote was considered the grade of recommendation with the corresponding median also presented (table 1).

The results reveal a high degree of concordance between the task force and EUVAS survey votes. Lower grades of recommendation by the EUVAS survey occurred for the use of rituximab (D vs C) in patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) suffering new-onset ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) and for maintenance therapy regimens using methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil (B vs A). In non-organ, non-life threatening ANCA-associated vasculitis, no task force members voted grade A for use of methotrexate or mycophenolate in such situations, compared with 35% and 12% of the EUVAS group choosing these as options, respectively.

The task force also voted in a greater proportion for grade C than the EUVAS group for either methotrexate or mycophenolate for remission maintenance (35% vs 30% and 31%, respectively, for the EUVAS votes). Although both the task force and EUVAS voting patterns spread across the strengths of recommendation for methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil, there was much greater agreement for the use of azathioprine for remission maintenance therapy in AAV, reflecting favouring azathioprine as the agent of choice in such situations.

### Efficacy and safety of rituximab in the treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^114Pfq2y]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a rare small-vessel vasculitis characterised by eosinophil-rich and necrotising granulomatous inflammation, frequently associated with asthma and eosinophilia. The 2012 International Chapel Hill Consensus Conference includes EGPA in the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) associated vasculitis (AAV) group, although only 40% of the patients test positive for ANCA. Although yet to be fully elucidated, the pathogenesis of EGPA has some distinctive pathophysiological mechanisms from the other AAV disease phenotypes. These include an increased interleukin (IL)-5 production and consequent increased maturation and survival of eosinophils. A predominant Th2 response, as levels of Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-13, are raised in EGPA. Recommendations for EGPA management are often extrapolated from experience in the more common AAV subgroups (granulomatous with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA)), and this approach may not be reliable.EGPA has been the subject of few randomised controlled trials. The MIRRA trial of mepolizumab (A Double-blind, Randomised, Placebo-controlled Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of Mepolizumab in the Treatment of Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis in Subjects Receiving Standard of Care Therapy), a humanised monoclonal antibody that targets IL-5, has been the only industry sponsored trial in EGPA and a positive result led to an approval for EGPA by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In this trial, mepolizumab led to more accrued weeks of remission than placebo (28% vs 3%) and reduction of the mean daily dose of prednisolone at week 52 (9.2 mg in the mepolizumab group vs 13.5 mg in the placebo group). Based on the long-term observational studies, EGPA patients are subgrouped into those with poor prognostic factors (such as serum creatinine > 140 µmol/L; proteinuria > 1 g/day; or central nervous system, gastrointestinal or myocardial involvement), in whom cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids are recommended and those without poor prognostic factors for whom prednisolone with or without an immunosuppressive, such as, azathioprine is recommended. Despite therapy most patients remain glucocorticoid dependent with a relapsing/remitting course as the glucocorticoid dose is weaned and acquire a high cumulative exposure to glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents with their attendant complications. There is a clear need for newer therapies that achieve sustained remission with low or no concomitant glucocorticoids requirement.

### Score to assess the probability of relapse in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis [^114hfQbn]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) are the two main antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV).GPA and MPA differ in their pathogenesis, genetics and serotypes, but patients with these two types of vasculitis share many clinical features and currently receive similar treatments. A therapeutic strategy combining glucocorticoids (GC) and cyclophosphamide or rituximab to induce remission has dramatically improved survival of AAV in the past decades.

Despite this improvement, maintaining remission in patients with GPA or MPA remains challenging. Relapse occurs in 13.7%–44% of cases at 18–36 months depending on the duration of follow-up, patient characteristics and maintenance treatment. Maintenance therapy with low-dose preemptive rituximab has significantly decreased the risk of relapse in comparison with azathioprine, but relapses still occur after rituximab discontinuation. Long-term follow-up of the MAINRITSAN 1 trial showed that relapse-free survival was 58% at 60 months in patients treated with rituximab 500 mg every 6 months for 18 months. Increasing the duration of azathioprine maintenance therapy from 24 to 48 months has been shown to decrease the risk of relapse and improve renal outcome.

### What does the future hold for clinical studies in vasculitis? [^111TJkXZ]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

The era prior to 1990 was a time of careful observation of disease presentation, course, outcomes and meticulous pathology studies. These mainly single-centre studies introduced new life-saving therapies for drugs still used effectively today. In the 1970-1980s, cyclophosphamide (CyP) added to glucocorticosteroids (GCS) was shown to be life-saving. The trade-off was often severe adverse events. Some forms of vasculitis were found not as ominous as thought initially. Some could be treated with safer drugs [e.g. methotrexate (MTX)]. However, whether mild or severe, patients were not cured. From 1990 to the present large collaborative networks have provided studies were not possible heretofore. Randomized controlled trials captured and manipulated vast amounts of data, banked biological specimens and shared these resources and intellectual capital, moving the field forward at an extraordinary pace. We now know that even for severe forms of granulomatosis and polyangiitis [granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), Wegener's granulomatosus (WG)], microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS), we do not need to use CyP for extended periods. We have learned recently that rituximab is as effective as CyP for severe WG and MPA. We should never again see the permanent toxicities born from years of chronic CyP use. However, short courses of CyP remain useful and can be life-saving. Step-down therapy from CyP is now a standard of care, perhaps to be replaced by rituximab in the future. If one accepts the premise that there are few cures at present for idiopathic large- and small-vessel vasculitis, we will serve our patients well if we can determine the most effective initial therapy that leads to a maintenance strategy for remission with least risk. Ultimately, we wish to identify causes of vasculitis so they can be used as a wedge to secure cures. Unmet needs and strategies are as follows: (1) to increase the numbers of vasculitis-trained physicians; (2) to define risk-benefit formulae for chronic maintenance therapy versus discontinuation of treatment after remission; (3) to define risk- and cost-benefit formulae for laboratory monitoring; (4) large-scale studies with longer follow-up that explore inhibition of interleukin-5 in CSS; (5) to explore the value of anti-interferon-γ for GCA, Takayasu's and other granulomatous vasculitides; and (6) identification of aetiological factors: cures will probably be linked to knowledge of the antigen driving the disease, plus vulnerabilities of the patient that prepare them to develop an illness phenotype. Improved outcomes using anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive agents do not rule out infection as a driver for autoimmunity. Techniques that can facilitate pathogen discovery have never been more sophisticated.

### Rituximab for older patients with antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody-associated vasculitis… [^115omALP]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Exposure At least 1 infusion of rituximab as induction or maintenance therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures Occurrence of remission, relapse, drug discontinuation, death, and serious infections. Results. For the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis, rituximab in combination with high-dose glucocorticoid regimens has been shown in randomized clinical trials to be noninferior to cyclophosphamide when used for remission induction therapy11, 12 and superior to azathioprine when used for remission maintenance therapy. 13, 14 Serious infections and deaths among patients receiving rituximab therapy were similar to those observed with cyclophosphamide induction therapy and azathioprine maintenance therapy. In a single-center cohort study15 involving 114 patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis, the serious infection rate was 4. 9 per 100 patient-years with the use of rituximab as induction and maintenance therapy.

In addition, data were obtained from a call for observation of patients 75 years and older sent to French Vasculitis Study Group members on June 6, 2019. Patients were included if they had a diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis according to criteria from the 2012 revised Chapel Hill Consensus Conference, 1 received at least 1 infusion of rituximab as induction and/or maintenance therapy after age 75 years, and were either followed up for at least 6 months or deceased. All patients received high-dose glucocorticoid regimens in combination with rituximab, with an initial daily dose of 1. 00 mg/kg. In addition to rituximab and glucocorticoid regimens, 18 patients received at least 1 additional therapy; 9 patients received cyclophosphamide, 10 received plasma exchange, 2 received methotrexate, and 1 received an infusion of immunoglobulins.

This large cohort study of patients 75 years and older who received rituximab for the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis found that rituximab therapy was associated with achievement and maintenance of remission in most patients. The occurrence of serious infections was high during induction therapy. Most infections reflected neutrophile- and monocyte- or macrophage-related immunodeficiency and occurred during the first months of induction therapy, which could suggest involvement of the concomitant high dose of glucocorticoids.

Mycophenolate mofetil

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), the prodrug of mycophenolic acid (MPA), is widely used as an immunosuppressive drug for the prophylaxis of organ rejection and in various autoimmune disorders (i.e. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, granulomatosis, uveitis and inflammatory bowel disease). MPA is a purine analogue that exerts its immunosuppressive effects by non‐competitive and reversible inhibition of the de novo pathway of purine biosynthesis, thus blocking the proliferation and clonal expansion of T and B lymphocytes, providing an immunosuppressive effect. The use of MMF in iTTP has only been reported in case reports, where it was used following rituximab relapse or with concomitant rituximab administration. Of note, MMF was associated with a decrease in platelet production in a patient with iTTP.

Cyclophosphamide

Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent exerting its effect on highly proliferating cells, especially B and T lymphocytes; it is therefore considered as a lymphoablative agent. It is commonly used in autoimmune diseases; however, most of the available data in iTTP involve refractory patients at the acute phase of the disease. Our group assessed five patients treated with cyclophosphamide due to refractoriness or exacerbation, although only one patient received rituximab previously. Cyclophosphamide led to a remission in these patients as part of the acute phase therapy, but adverse events included severe infections.

### Pituitary hypophysitis in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA): a case series [^1128xxJM]. Pituitary (2024). Medium credibility.

In the published literature, the combination of cyclophosphamide and high-dose glucocorticoids has been used most frequently, and historically was shown to reduce 1-year mortality from 80% to 10–20% in patients with systemic GPA. However, toxicity of cyclophosphamide and the high relapse rate remain a challenge. The past decade has seen increasing use of RTX, a B lymphocyte-depleting monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody targeting B lymphocytes, including those producing ANCAs, both for remission induction and maintenance therapy. The landmark Rituximab in ANCA-Associated Vasculitis (RAVE) trial showed that treatment with RTX and glucocorticoids was equivalent to the standard combination of cyclophosphamide with glucocorticoids for attainment of disease remission at 6 months. RTX is now recommended as a potential alternative to cyclophosphamide as first line therapy in current international consensus guidelines, although specific data on rare disease manifestations such as hypophysitis are lacking. Promisingly, a recent case series of 11 patients with CNS involvement of ANCA-associated vasculitis by Krishna et al. showed that RTX was as effective as cyclophosphamide in remission induction in patients with CNS involvement of GPA. The use of cyclophosphamide and rituximab in combination has been studied in one randomised trial and several uncontrolled series, an approach that may facilitate rapid disease control and glucocorticoid-sparing, which was used successfully in one of our patients. A regimen using glucocorticoid and RTX alone might be more suitable for patients where pituitary involvement is the predominant manifestation, but larger studies will be required to confirm our observational experience.

Regarding remission-maintenance, several studies have confirmed the superiority of regular rituximab infusions to conventional disease-modifying immunosuppressants, particularly in those with relapsing disease, administered either at fixed 4–6 monthly intervals or tailored to circulating B lymphocyte or ANCA levels, and this approach is now recommended depending on availability of rituximab. Novel therapies for AAV, including GPA, include avacopan, a C5a-receptor antagonist that has shown efficacy as a glucocorticoid sparing agent, when used alongside rituximab or cyclophosphamide, in a recent large randomised controlled trial. Avacopan was recently approved for treatment of AAV in the UK, although specific data regarding treatment of rare disease manifestations such as hypophysitis are lacking.

All our patients received combination therapies, including high-dose glucocorticoids with biological and/or immunosuppressant drugs (RTX, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide), depending on the severity of pituitary GPA and the presence of other systemic manifestations (Table 2). In all cases, there was radiological evidence of GPA-related hypophysitis with excellent pituitary response to therapy.

### Long-term safety of rituximab in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and in microscopic polyangiitis [^112zDW6X]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The present study was undertaken to conduct a phase IV, open-label, prospective study to characterize the long-term safety of rituximab in a 4-year observational registry of adult patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) within the US.

Methods

Patients initiating treatment with rituximab were evaluated every 6 months for up to 4 years. Outcomes included the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), infusion-related reactions (IRRs), and SAEs of specific interest, including serious infections, serious cardiac events, serious vascular events, and malignancies.

Results

Overall, 97 patients (72 with GPA and 25 with MPA) received rituximab through a median of 8 (range 1–28) infusions and were followed up for a median of 3.94 years (range 0.05–4.32 years). The estimated incidence rates (95% confidence interval [95% CI]) of serious infections, serious cardiac events, and serious vascular events were 7.11 (4.55–10.58), 5.03 (2.93–8.06), and 2.37 (1.02–4.67) per 100 patient-years (PYs), respectively. No IRRs or SAEs occurred within 24 hours of an infusion of rituximab. None of the 9 deaths reported (crude mortality rate 2.67 [95% CI 1.22–5.06] per 100 PYs) were considered to be related to use of rituximab.

Conclusion

The safety profile of long-term treatment with rituximab in patients with GPA or MPA was consistent with that of rituximab administered for shorter durations and with rituximab's known safety profile in other autoimmune diseases for which it has received regulatory approval. These findings provide clinicians with long-term, practice-level safety data for rituximab in the treatment of GPA or MPA.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for granulomatosis with polyangiitis, more specifically with respect to management of relapse (avacopan), CanVasc 2023 guidelines recommend to consider adding oral avacopan (30 mg BID) for induction of remission in patients with relapsing GPA treated with cyclophosphamide or rituximab.

### Long-term safety of rituximab in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and in microscopic polyangiitis [^116WjyWs]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

SAEs were reported in 39.2% of patients, with an overall IR of 27.84 per 100 PYs. The distribution and type of SAEs were consistent with the known safety profile of rituximab in GPA and MPA and in other autoimmune indications. The incidence of SAEs among patients who had received repeat treatment was slightly lower (23.90 per 100 PYs), suggesting that additional infusions of rituximab and increasing exposure to rituximab over time were not associated with an increased risk of SAEs. These data are also consistent with the rate of SAEs over 18 months reported in patients with ANCA‐associated vasculitis who were treated with rituximab for induction of remission (42%) in a controlled clinical trial. However, the proportion of patients with SAEs in the current study was numerically higher than that observed in patients with RA in the Sunstone registry (29.7%). Because the majority of SAEs in RaVeR were single events, the rate of SAEs is likely not the result of SAEs of a particular type or pattern.

This study has some limitations to consider. This study excluded patients < 18 years old; therefore, these results are not generalizable to children with GPA or MPA. Given the observational and open‐label nature of RaVeR, the rituximab dose and regimen were administered at the treating physicians' discretion, leading to inevitable variability in dose, intervals, frequency, and duration of treatment. In addition, concomitant medications were managed without restriction by the treating physicians. It is possible that AEs may have resulted from the use of concomitant medications, but causality is difficult to determine due to the absence of a comparator arm. AEs may have also resulted from underlying GPA or MPA or other preexisting concurrent medical conditions because patients with preexisting conditions were not excluded from the study in order to reflect a real‐world setting more accurately. Finally, data on immunoglobulin levels were not collected, preventing the assessment of hypogammaglobulinemia in this population.

In this study, no new safety concerns were identified for the use of rituximab to treat GPA or MPA. The safety profile of long‐term (up to 4 years) follow‐up treatment with rituximab in patients with GPA or MPA was consistent with the known overall safety profile of rituximab in patients with GPA or MPA treated for shorter periods. Safety data were also consistent with the known safety profile of rituximab in other autoimmune diseases in which it is approved for use. These findings provide clinicians with long‐term, practice‐level safety data for rituximab in the treatment of GPA or MPA.

### Maintenance therapy in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis: who needs what and for how long? [^1175CFbn]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV) are severe chronic auto-immune diseases in which the small vessels are inflamed. Nowadays, in the majority of patients disease can be brought into remission with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids. However, depending upon disease characteristics patients with AAV have a risk of 29–60% to experience relapses of disease within 5 years despite maintenance therapy after induction of remission with less toxic agents, such as azathioprine, methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil. More recently, rituximab has been found effective in both induction and maintenance of remission in AAV. This review discusses the different aspects of maintenance therapy in AAV based on reported cohorts and studies, including the different agents, therapy duration, efficacy or lack thereof and future directions. Finally, recommendations are made who to treat and for how long.

### Rituximab vs cyclophosphamide induction therapy for patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^116BaKxq]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA)–associated vasculitides (AAVs) are potentially life-threatening and commonly relapsing diseases in which necrotizing vasculitis predominantly affects small-to-medium vessels. Among AAVs, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is characterized by granulomatous inflammation, usually involving the upper and lower respiratory tract, with frequent necrotizing glomerulonephritis, and with ANCA-targeting proteinase 3 (PR3) in most patients with active disease. Remission induction treatment of new-onset organ-threatening or life-threatening AAV usually combines glucocorticoids with cyclophosphamide or rituximab.

The diagnosis of GPA as opposed to microscopic polyangiitis is associated with a lower probability of achieving complete remission — defined as no evidence of clinical disease activity while not receiving glucocorticoid treatment — and a higher risk of relapse. Similarly, PR3-ANCA positivity as opposed to myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA positivity is independently associated with a higher risk of relapse.

Results of randomized clinical trials, showed rituximab's noninferiority to cyclophosphamide for remission induction in severe AAVs, with neither treatment having a specific advantage for GPA in adjusted analyses. However, post hoc analysis of the trial datashowed that rituximab-treated patients with PR3-AAV achieved complete remission at 6 months more frequently than cyclophosphamide-treated patients. Trial limitations included the enrollment of patients with GPA or microscopic polyangiitis, who might need to be studied separately; small sample size owing to the rarity of those AAVs; and highly selected patients with minor comorbidities that precluded generalization. For those reasons, registry data are useful to complement data from randomized clinical trials to investigate the external validity of drugs prescribed in routine practice. Thus, it remains to be established whether rituximab is more effective than cyclophosphamide at specifically achieving GPA remission. The objective of this study was to undertake an emulation target trial using observational data to compare rituximab vs cyclophosphamide efficacies at inducing remission in a large number of unselected patients with GPA.

Remission induction for active, severe granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) — For patients with active, severe GPA/MPA, we conditionally recommend treatment with rituximab over cyclophosphamide for remission induction. Both rituximab and cyclophosphamide, in combination with glucocorticoids, have been used for remission induction in GPA and MPA, and rituximab has been shown to provide similar benefits to cyclophosphamide for remission induction in a randomized controlled trial. Rituximab is considered less toxic than cyclophosphamide and was preferred by the Patient Panel; a single course of cyclophosphamide can carry substantial risks such as neutropenia, bladder injury, and the small but present potential for infertility, and risks of malignancy and infertility increase when repeated courses are used. For adult rituximab dosing, retrospective studies suggest that 375 mg/m² every week for 4 weeks or 1,000 mg on days 1 and 15 are equally efficacious, and the choice between these regimens should be guided by patient preferences and values.

### Pediatric-onset limited ANCA-associated vasculitis arising during pre-existing chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis [^112Hca7E]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), a chronic form of ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody) associated vasculitis (AAV) involving small to medium sized arteries, is primarily characterized by granulomatous inflammation of the upper and lower respiratory tracts and pauci-immune necrotizing glomerulonephritis, as well as the potential for other organ vasculitis. GPA is rare in children, with rising incidence in adults. In the pediatric population, disease onset usually arises during the second decade of life, affecting females more than males. Characteristic clinical presentation involves a triad of inflammation in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, along with renal disease. Limited GPA is a milder form commonly isolated to the upper respiratory tract. The diagnosis of GPA relies on a combination of clinical manifestations, the detection of specific serological markers (mainly ANCA, particularly PR3-ANCA or cANCA), and distinct histopathological findings (such as necrotizing granulomas of the upper and/or lower respiratory tract, inflammation in small to medium arteries, capillaries, or small veins, or pauci-immune glomerulonephritis). Chest imaging usually shows nodular and fixed infiltrates or cavitations. Treatment of GPA depends on organ involvement and severity. More severe disease necessitates the use of stronger agents such as cyclophosphamide and high dose corticosteroids. Remission and relapse rates, as well as adverse events were found to be similar rituximab and cyclophosphamide. In addition, rituximab was found to be efficient in re-inducing remission after relapse. In addition, mycophenolate mofetil was found to be non-inferior to cyclophosphamide in inducing remission in patients with estimated GFR > 15 ml/min/1.73 m2. However, higher relapse rates were detected in PR3-ANCA positive patients. After induction of remission, maintenance treatment can be continued with low dose corticosteroids, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine or rituximab.

Maintenance treatment with rituximab

Several RCTs on the use of RTX for remission maintenance have been published since the 2016 EULAR recommendations for AAV.

In the RITAZAREM trial (table 7), patients with relapsing GPA or MPA received remission induction treatment with RTX and GC. Those achieving disease control by month 4 were randomised to receive maintenance treatment with either 1000 mg RTX at months 4, 8, 12, 16 or AZA (and standardised GC tapering). The SLR identified preliminary data (published as abstract only) but the full publication became recently available. The trial results demonstrate relapse risk to be significantly lower in the RTX compared with the AZA group. This supports the findings of the MAINRITSAN trial comparing RTX for 18 months and AZA for 22 months for remission maintenance treatment after induction treatment with CYC and GC. The MAINRITSAN trial reported RTX to be more efficacious than AZA to prevent relapses at 28 months (HR 6.61; 95% CI 1.56 to 27.96; p = 0.002). Major relapse-free survival remained better in the RTX group (71.9%; 95% CI 61.2% to 84.6%) compared with the AZA group (49.4%; 95% CI 38.0% to 64.3%; p = 0.003) at 60 months of follow-up.

### Efficacy and safety of belimumab and azathioprine for maintenance of remission in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis: a randomized controlled study [^111RHTBz]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) (related types of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody [ANCA]–associated vasculitis [AAV]) are organ‐ and life‐threatening systemic vasculitides characterized by the presence of autoantibodies. B cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AAV 1, 2.

The current recommendation for the maintenance of remission in AAV consists of treatment with low‐dose glucocorticoids in combination with one of the following therapies: azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, or rituximab 3. Rituximab, a B cell–depleting agent shown to reduce the risk of relapse in GPA and MPA, is becoming the standard therapy for the induction of remission in AAV 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Cyclophosphamide has similar efficacy as that of rituximab as an induction therapy 3, 7. Despite use of the above therapies, relapse is a major clinical problem in AAV, and there remains uncertainty as to the best approach for preventing relapses after remission is obtained.

Several lines of evidence support a role for the B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) in the pathogenesis of AAV. BLyS is expressed by neutrophils, key cells in AAV pathogenesis, and elevated levels of circulating BLyS have been reported in patients with AAV 1, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. In addition, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus demonstrate increased levels of BLyS following treatment with rituximab; such BLyS elevation may be linked to the production of autoantibodies by autoreactive B cells 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. Belimumab, a human IgG1λ monoclonal antibody against BLyS, is licensed for the treatment of adults with active, autoantibody‐associated systemic lupus erythematosus who are receiving standard therapy 22, 23.

The current study, Belimumab in Remission of Vasculitis (BREVAS), examined the safety and efficacy of belimumab plus azathioprine and low‐dose oral glucocorticoids for the maintenance of remission in AAV, following induction of remission with either rituximab or cyclophosphamide with glucocorticoids. The treatments were tested within a randomized controlled trial setting.

### Rituximab for the treatment of wegener's granulomatosis and microscopic polyangiitis (RAVE) [^111pZr9J]. ClinicalTrials (2005). Low credibility.

Study hypothesis: Rituximab is not inferior to conventional therapy in its ability to induce disease remission by Month 6. Current conventional therapies for ANCA-associated vasculitis are associated with high incidences of treatment failure, disease relapse, substantial toxicity, and patient morbidity and mortality. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This study will evaluate the efficacy of rituximab with glucocorticoids in inducing disease remission in patients with severe forms of AAV. During the remission induction phase, all participants will receive oral prednisone daily. Prednisone tapering will be completed by the Month 6 study visit. Next, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two arms. Arm 1 participants will receive rituximab infusions once weekly for 4 weeks and cyclophosphamide placebo daily for 3 to 6 months.

Arm 2 participants will receive rituximab placebo infusions once weekly for 4 weeks and CYC daily for 3 to 6 months. During the remission maintenance phase, participants in Arm 1 will discontinue CYC placebo and start oral azathioprine placebo daily until Month 18. Participants in Arm 2 will discontinue CYC and start AZA daily until Month
18. Participants who fail treatment before Month 6 will be crossed over to the other treatment arm unless there are specific contraindications. Participants in either group who reach clinical remission before they complete 6 months of therapy may switch from CYC/placebo to AZA/placebo if directed by their physicians. All participants will be followed for at least 18 months. Initially, study visits are weekly, progressing to monthly and then quarterly visits as the study proceeds. Blood collection will occur at each study visit.

### ANCA vasculitis: time for a change in treatment paradigm? Not yet [^116TrorV]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

The ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAVs) are conventionally treated with a strategy of remission induction followed by maintenance therapy using glucocorticoids combined with CYC during induction and AZA for maintenance. Recently, several randomized controlled trials have been published that question whether these drugs should remain those of choice. B-cell depletion using rituximab is at least as effective as CYC for remission induction in newly presenting patients, but long-term efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness data are awaited, and thus rituximab should be reserved for patients at high risk of infertility. Rituximab seems to be effective at inducing remission in relapsing patients. Whether routine pre-emptive treatment with rituximab for remission maintenance is a better approach than waiting for relapse is unknown. MTX and LEF have similar efficacy to AZA, but are not significantly safer; while MMF is less effective. Thus, AZA remains the conventional maintenance drug of choice.

### Induction and maintenance of remission with mycophenolate mofetil in ANCA-associated vasculitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114UACSa]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Uncertainties exist about the use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in anti-neutrophil cytoplasmatic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), particularly for remission maintenance.

Methods

Systematic review and meta-analysis of phase II and III trials assessing the use of MMF in AAV, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). A comprehensive search of several databases (Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus) from inception to 5 May 2020 has been conducted. Trial data were extracted to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and estimates (ES) for MMF efficacy (remission-induction and maintenance). Severe adverse effects (SAEs) were collected.

Results

From 565 articles captured, 10 met the predefined criteria, 5 phase II and 5 III trials; 4 assessed remission-induction, 3 remission maintenance and 3 both. The pooled OR for remission-induction at 6 months was 1.06 (95% confidence interval 0.74, 1.52), with no significant difference by subgroup meta-analysis of trials stratified by different study-level features (i.e. kidney disease, MPA, myeloperoxidase-ANCA positivity, newly diagnosed disease) (P > 0.05). The overall ES for remission maintenance at the end of follow-up ranged between 51% and 91% (I2 = 74.8%). Subgroup meta-analysis identified kidney involvement as a possible source of heterogeneity, yielding a significantly higher rate of sustained remission in trials enrolling only patients with kidney involvement (92%, 76–100%) versus those enrolling patients with and without kidney involvement (56%, 45–66%). Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. During follow-up, the frequency of SAEs in MMF-based treatment arms was 31.8%.

Conclusions

In AAV, MMF use was significantly associated with higher sustained remission rates in trials enrolling only patients with kidney involvement. These findings might influence clinical practice.
