## Question

Methotrexate eye drops for diabetic retinopathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether methotrexate eye drops are used or effective for diabetic retinopathy and what the evidence says. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether topical eye drops can pharmacologically reach the retina in therapeutic concentrations. Then, I should review authoritative guidelines to see if methotrexate appears for diabetic retinopathy care. Next, I will search for any evidence of methotrexate — topical or intravitreal — in diabetic retinopathy. After that, I should confirm what the standard-of-care treatments are for diabetic macular edema and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Finally, I'll synthesize a clear, clinically grounded recommendation based on efficacy, safety, and delivery feasibility while double-checking for any contrasting data I might have missed [^112jyxgj].

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic feasibility of "methotrexate eye drops" for a posterior segment disease like diabetic retinopathy; wait, let me verify the ocular barriers and delivery constraints because if topical medication cannot reach the retina, its use would be implausible regardless of mechanism. The cornea, sclera, and, critically, the blood–retinal barrier limit drug penetration to the posterior pole, which is why retinal diseases are typically treated with intravitreal delivery rather than topical drops or systemic therapy unless very high systemic exposures are used; this is precisely why anti-VEGF agents for diabetic retinopathy are given intravitreally rather than topically or systemically in routine care [^115wyuqj] [^115Az7Fm].

> Next, I should review current guideline recommendations; hold on, I should verify specifically whether the ADA 2025 Standards of Care mention methotrexate at all for diabetic eye disease. For center-involving diabetic macular edema with vision loss, the ADA repeatedly recommends intravitreal anti-VEGF as first-line therapy; there is no mention of methotrexate as a therapy for diabetic retinopathy or DME in these guidance sections, which instead emphasize anti-VEGF as standard of care [^112jyxgj] [^116zYR7f] [^115kKdjr]. For persistent DME not responsive to anti-VEGF or when anti-VEGF is not suitable, the ADA recommends considering intravitreal corticosteroids and, in some cases, focal/grid laser, again without any role for methotrexate [^1141t3jb] [^1156Jcy4] [^115FExjN].

> I will now examine proliferative diabetic retinopathy guidance; I need to ensure I'm not missing a niche use. The ADA recommends panretinal photocoagulation for high-risk PDR and, in selected cases, intravitreal anti-VEGF as an alternative or adjunct, but does not include methotrexate anywhere in PDR management pathways; a recent Cochrane review also supports anti-VEGF as effective for PDR, further reinforcing that methotrexate is not part of the therapeutic armamentarium here [^114EBcpa] [^111VZB2D] [^114TqMDZ] [^116WMzvV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — maybe methotrexate appears in retinal literature for other posterior segment conditions and I should double-check whether any of that spills over into diabetic retinopathy; I should confirm where intravitreal methotrexate is actually used. Intravitreal methotrexate is described primarily for noninfectious uveitis/uveitic macular edema, vitreoretinal lymphoma, and proliferative vitreoretinopathy, not for routine treatment of diabetic retinopathy; one report even noted adding methotrexate to silicone oil in advanced diabetic retinopathy cases at the end of surgery without preventing recurrent detachment, underscoring that this is not an established DR therapy and was not clinically efficacious for that surgical endpoint [^112gBvxS] [^111gc9Qv] [^113Ubjba] [^114iiAG9] [^112jHid6]. Hmm, wait a minute — there is a small study evaluating corneal endothelial safety after intravitreal methotrexate in eyes with persistent DME, but it did not establish MTX efficacy for DME; it only assessed corneal endothelium parameters, so I should not infer therapeutic benefit for DR from it [^117TBCar].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence for current first-line treatments to ensure I am correctly weighing the "known effective" options against an unproven idea like methotrexate eye drops. Anti-VEGF therapies have robust randomized data and regulatory labeling for DR endpoints and DME, such as aflibercept and ranibizumab, and comparative trials like Protocol T support their vision and anatomic benefits over two years in DME, aligning with ADA guidance [^115paAy2] [^113Euk7z] [^115d79fw]. For PDR, high-quality evidence and systematic reviews similarly support anti-VEGF as an alternative or adjunct to PRP in defined scenarios, again with no methotrexate role identified in these bodies of evidence [^116WMzvV] [^114EBcpa] [^111VZB2D].

> But wait, what if topical anti-inflammatory strategies could help DME — does that open the door for topical methotrexate by analogy? Let me reconsider and verify; topical NSAIDs have been studied for diabetic cystoid macular edema with low-quality and insufficient evidence overall, and the pharmacologic barrier problem persists for posterior segment disease, which is why intravitreal approaches dominate efficacy data; moreover, anti-VEGF safety has been extensively studied at a population level, supporting their use when indicated, whereas there is no corresponding evidence base for topical methotrexate in DR [^115Az7Fm] [^114jK77c] [^115wyuqj].

> Synthesis and clinical take: I need to ensure the conclusion reflects both feasibility and evidence. There are no guideline recommendations or clinical trial data supporting methotrexate eye drops for diabetic retinopathy, and topical delivery is not expected to achieve therapeutic retinal levels due to ocular barriers; in contrast, evidence-based care for DR centers on intravitreal anti-VEGF for center-involving DME, PRP for PDR with selective use of anti-VEGF, and consideration of intravitreal corticosteroids or laser in anti-VEGF–refractory DME, none of which include methotrexate for DR management [^112jyxgj] [^116zYR7f] [^115kKdjr] [^1141t3jb] [^114EBcpa]. Therefore, methotrexate eye drops are not indicated or supported for diabetic retinopathy; if methotrexate is considered at all in ophthalmology, it is in intravitreal form for other indications such as uveitis, PVR, or lymphoma, and not as a topical therapy for DR, so I would advise standard-of-care DR treatment pathways in consultation with a retina specialist [^112gBvxS] [^114iiAG9] [^113Ubjba] [^111VZB2D].

---

Currently, methotrexate eye drops are not used or recommended for diabetic retinopathy because there is no clinical evidence supporting their efficacy or safety in this setting [^112jyxgj]. Although methotrexate's anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects are established in other ocular conditions [^112gBvxS], topical delivery is unlikely to achieve therapeutic retinal levels due to ocular barriers [^115wyuqj] [^115Az7Fm]. Intravitreal anti-VEGF agents remain the first-line therapy for diabetic retinopathy [^116zYR7f], and methotrexate eye drops are not included in current clinical guidelines [^115kKdjr].

---

## Pharmacological rationale for methotrexate in diabetic retinopathy

Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, reducing DNA synthesis and cell proliferation, and exerts anti-inflammatory effects by lowering cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 [^114eAKW8]. These properties suggest a potential to reduce retinal inflammation and neovascularization in diabetic retinopathy, but clinical validation is lacking.

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

Currently, there are no published clinical studies or trials evaluating methotrexate eye drops for diabetic retinopathy. Available evidence pertains to intravitreal methotrexate in other ocular conditions (e.g. uveitis [^112gBvxS], proliferative vitreoretinopathy [^114iiAG9]), not diabetic retinopathy [^111gc9Qv].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and ocular penetration

Topical methotrexate faces significant ocular barriers (cornea, conjunctiva, sclera, blood-retinal barrier) that limit retinal penetration [^115wyuqj]. There is no evidence that topical methotrexate achieves therapeutic retinal concentrations, making clinical efficacy unlikely.

---

## Safety and tolerability

Methotrexate eye drops have not been studied in diabetic retinopathy; thus, ocular safety is unknown. Systemic methotrexate can cause corneal epitheliopathy, keratitis, and conjunctivitis, and intravitreal methotrexate has been associated with corneal toxicity; similar risks may occur with topical use [^113Ubjba].

---

## Comparison with current standard treatments

Intravitreal anti-VEGF agents (ranibizumab, aflibercept, bevacizumab) [^113Euk7z] [^115paAy2] are the first-line therapy for diabetic retinopathy [^116zYR7f] and diabetic macular edema, with strong evidence for improving visual acuity and reducing retinal thickness [^115d79fw]. Methotrexate eye drops have no comparative data and are not included in guidelines [^112jyxgj].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines (ADA 2025) recommend intravitreal anti-VEGF as first-line therapy for diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema [^116zYR7f], with intravitreal corticosteroids or laser photocoagulation reserved for specific cases [^1141t3jb] [^115FExjN] [^114EBcpa]. Methotrexate eye drops are not recommended [^115kKdjr] [^112jyxgj].

---

## Ongoing clinical trials

There are no registered trials evaluating methotrexate eye drops for diabetic retinopathy.

---

## Potential advantages and disadvantages

### Advantages

Potential advantages include non-invasive administration, which may improve patient adherence, and anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects, offering a theoretical benefit for retinal inflammation and neovascularization [^113ra6zv].

---

### Disadvantages

- Limited ocular penetration: Unlikely to reach therapeutic retinal levels [^115wyuqj].
- Lack of clinical evidence: No data supporting efficacy or safety [^115kKdjr].
- Potential ocular toxicity: Risk of corneal and conjunctival adverse effects [^113Ubjba] [^112jHid6].

---

Methotrexate eye drops are not supported by clinical evidence for diabetic retinopathy, and topical delivery is unlikely to achieve therapeutic retinal levels [^115wyuqj]. Intravitreal anti-VEGF agents remain the standard of care [^112jyxgj], and methotrexate eye drops are not included in current guidelines [^111VZB2D].

### Vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (anti-VEGF) in the management of diabetic macular oedema: A systematic review [^112t2GZs]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

The authors address the question of whether vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (anti-VEGF) lead to better clinical outcomes than other treatments in patients with clinically manifest diabetic macular oedema (DMO), which is the leading cause of vision loss in the working age population in developed countries.

- **Methods**: The authors performed a systematic literature search in common databases and compiled the evidence according to the GRADE methodology. They analyzed clinically relevant improvements in visual acuity, vision-related quality of life, and local or systemic adverse events.

- **Results**: In a proportion of patients (on average 25%), VEGF inhibitors result in better visual acuity (≥ 15 ETDRS letters or equivalent) than in patients treated with laser photocoagulation or sham injection. The number of injections required for long-term improvement, as well as the general long-term efficacy, is unknown. The evidence is not sufficient to confirm the safety of the products in patients with DMO and does not suggest the superiority of a single product.

- **Conclusion**: For some patients with DMO, VEGF inhibitors seem to be more effective as a short-term treatment option than alternative therapies. The evidence is not of sufficient quality to confirm safety. Decisions on financing should take into account the high price difference between the products and ongoing research.

### Management of noninfectious posterior uveitis with intravitreal drug therapy [^116Tgxbm]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Intravitreal methotrexate appears to be a promising alternative to intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) in unilateral diseases, especially in phakic, steroid responders, due to a lower risk of increasing intraocular pressure (IOP) and cataract formation. The extended remission effect by methotrexate in some patients should be explored in future studies. Thus far, studies have shown that intravitreal methotrexate alone may not be adequate to achieve remission in various uveitic entities and may be used as an adjunct with other forms of therapy. It is imperative to monitor the development of adverse events, such as corneal decompensation, which may require treatment with topical folinic acid. Larger-scale and randomized controlled trials are definitely required to establish the efficacy and safety profile of intravitreal methotrexate. Contraindications to systemic methotrexate should also be observed.

### Non-invasive evaluation of toxicity in vitreoretinal domain following insertion of sustained release methotrexate micro-implant [^112Jfxwv]. Experimental Eye Research (2021). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and toxicity profile of a chitosan (CS) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA)-based sustained release methotrexate (MTX) intravitreal micro-implant in normal rabbit eyes. This evaluation was conducted using non-invasive testing methods, including electroretinography (ERG), ultrasound biomicroscopy (US), slit-lamp biomicroscopy (SLB), funduscopy, and intraocular pressure (IOP) assessments.

PLGA-coated CS-based micro-implants containing 400 μg of MTX and placebo micro-implants (without drug) were surgically implanted in the vitreous of the right and left eyes, respectively, in each of the thirty New Zealand rabbits. ERG, US, SLB, funduscopy, and IOP were assessed in both eyes at predetermined time points: days 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 56. The safety of the micro-implants was assessed by analyzing the ERG data using different statistical models to quantify and compare the functional integrity of the retina. Additionally, US, funduscopy, SLB, and IOP were employed to determine the condition of the retina, the micro-implant, and associated intraocular features.

Statistical analyses of the ERG data revealed unchanged functional integrity of the retina between eyes with the PLGA-coated CS-based MTX micro-implant and those with the placebo micro-implant. The US analysis showed that the micro-implants remained stationary throughout the study. SLB, funduscopy, and IOP further confirmed the absence of abnormalities in intraocular physiology.

In conclusion, the findings from ERG, US, SLB, funduscopy, and IOP demonstrated no detectable adverse effects caused by the biodegradable micro-implants. These non-invasive techniques appeared effective in evaluating implant safety.

### Intravitreal methotrexate infusion for proliferative vitreoretinopathy [^112jHid6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

In ophthalmology, intraocular MTX has been used to treat numerous inflammatory conditions such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis, sarcoidosis-related panuveitis, mucous membrane pemphigoid, rheumatoid-associated scleritis and episcleritis, sympathetic ophthalmia, and corticosteroid-resistant uveitis, while higher doses are used to treat primary intraocular lymphoma. Overall, intraocular MTX therapy has an excellent safety record both in animal models and in clinical practice, although corneal epitheliopathy and maculopathy have been reported in patients receiving multiple intraocular MTX injections for lymphoma.

A recent report included 250 µg of MTX in the silicone oil tamponade instilled at the end of retinal reattachment surgery in advanced diabetic retinopathy patients without significant adverse effects; however, clinical efficacy in preventing recurrent retinal detachment (reRD) in diabetic retinopathy was not observed.

In the present study, intravitreal MTX infusion (IMI) is used during pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) in patients at high risk of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) development, and its effects on reRD and final visual outcomes are assessed.

### Intraocular methotrexate in the treatment of uveitis and uveitic cystoid macular edema [^112gBvxS]. Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the use of intravitreal methotrexate (MTX) for the treatment of uveitis and uveitic cystoid macular edema (CME).

- **Design**: Prospective, consecutive, interventional case series.

- **Participants**: Fifteen eyes of 15 patients with a unilateral exacerbation of noninfectious intermediate, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis and/or CME, resulting in visual acuity (VA) of 20/40 or worse. Participants had a history of increased intraocular pressure (IOP) in response to corticosteroid administration.

- **Intervention**: Intravitreal injection of 400 microg in 0.1 mL MTX.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcome measure was VA, assessed using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study chart. Other outcome measures included ocular inflammation scores, time to relapse, levels of systemic corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy, and ocular coherence tomography. The potential complications of intravitreal MTX injections, such as cataract progression, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, and corneal epitheliopathy, were assessed.

- **Results**: VA improved significantly at all time points, most notably at the 3- and 6-month follow-up examinations. The mean visual improvement was 4 lines at 3 months and 4.5 lines at 6 months, with no statistical difference between the best VA obtained post-MTX injection and after previous corticosteroid treatment, including intravitreal triamcinolone acetate injection. Five patients experienced a relapse following a median of 4 months, but similar improvements were observed following re-injection. Ocular inflammation scores improved at all time points.

### Prevention of diabetic eye disease: The commonest cause of blindness in individuals younger than 65 years [^116B1YUG]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

There has been considerable advancement in the treatment of diabetes and understanding of the biochemical mechanisms underlying diabetic complications in the last 20 years. However, this advancement has not translated into a consistent reduction in diabetic retinopathy, one of the most frightening complications of diabetes mellitus. It is probable that greater attention to preventive intervention will help reduce the damage load in the near future, and that several drugs for the treatment of more advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy will become available.

Competent strategies targeting prevention based on screening programs should be proposed to reduce the burden and improve the clinical outcome of this devastating diabetes complication.

### Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy for diabetic macular edema [^111dbk4A]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a serious health problem that affects over 350 million individuals worldwide. Diabetic retinopathy (DR), the most common microvascular complication of diabetes, is the leading cause of new cases of blindness in working-aged adults. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is an advanced, vision-limiting complication of DR that affects nearly 30% of patients who have had diabetes for at least 20 years and is responsible for much of the vision loss due to DR.

The historic standard of care for DME has been macular laser photocoagulation, which has been shown to stabilize vision and reduce the rate of further vision loss by 50%. However, macular laser leads to significant vision recovery in only 15% of treated patients. Mechanisms contributing to the microvascular damage in DR and DME include the direct toxic effects of hyperglycemia, sustained alterations in cell signaling pathways, and chronic microvascular inflammation with leukocyte-mediated injury.

Chronic retinal microvascular damage results in the elevation of intraocular levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF), a potent, diffusible, endothelial-specific mitogen that mediates many important physiological processes, including the development and permeability of the vasculature. The identification of VEGF as an important pathophysiologic mediator of DME suggested that anti-VEGF therapy delivered to the eye might lead to improved visual outcomes in this disease. At the time of writing, four different inhibitors of VEGF, each administered by intraocular injection, have been tested in prospective studies.

### Factors associated with visual acuity and central subfield thickness changes when treating diabetic macular edema with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy: An exploratory analysis of the Protocol T randomized clinical trial [^115d79fw]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2019). High credibility.

Identifying the factors associated with the magnitude of treatment benefits from anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy for diabetic macular edema (DME) may help refine treatment expectations.

To address this, the objective was to identify baseline factors associated with vision and anatomic outcomes when managing DME with anti-VEGF therapy and determine if there are interactions between factors and the agent administered.

This study was a post hoc analysis of data from the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network multicenter randomized clinical trial, Protocol T, conducted between December 2016 and December 2017. Between August 22, 2012, and August 28, 2013, 660 participants with central-involved DME and vision impairment (approximate Snellen equivalent, 20/32–20/320) were enrolled.

Interventions included repeated 0.05-mL intravitreous injections of 2.0-mg aflibercept (201 eyes), 1.25-mg bevacizumab (185 eyes), or 0.3-mg ranibizumab (192 eyes) per protocol.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Change in visual acuity (VA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) central subfield thickness at 2 years and change in VA over 2 years (area under the curve [AUC]).

Among 578 participants, the median age (interquartile range) was 61 (54–67) years. Across anti-VEGF treatment groups, each baseline factor was associated with mean improvement in VA and a reduction in central DME compared with baseline. For every decade of participant age, the mean VA improvement was reduced by 2.1 letters (95% CI, -3.0 to -1.2; p < 0.001).

### Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor combined with intravitreal steroids for diabetic macular oedema [^111ehVPa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

The combination of steroid and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) intravitreal therapeutic agents could potentially have synergistic effects for treating diabetic macular oedema (DMO). If combined treatment is more effective than monotherapy, there would be significant implications for improving patient outcomes. Conversely, if there is no added benefit of combination therapy, people could be exposed to unnecessary local or systemic side effects.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of intravitreal agents that block vascular endothelial growth factor activity (anti-VEGF agents) plus intravitreal steroids versus monotherapy with macular laser, intravitreal steroids, or intravitreal anti-VEGF agents for managing DMO.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register (2018, Issue 1); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; LILACS; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov, and the ICTRP. The date of the search was 21 February 2018.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of intravitreal anti-VEGF combined with intravitreal steroids versus intravitreal anti-VEGF alone, intravitreal steroids alone, or macular laser alone for managing DMO. We included people with DMO of all ages and both sexes and trials where both eyes from one participant received different treatments.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Two authors independently reviewed the findings for consistency and reliability.

### Current and future approaches in the prevention and treatment of diabetic retinopathy [^111MfDAe]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of blindness worldwide and is the leading cause of blindness among working-age individuals in developed countries. This paper reviews the literature and discusses the pathogenesis, modifying risk factors, genetics, and treatment of DR. Special focus is placed on the rationale and effectiveness of therapeutic modalities, both current and future.

### Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents for diabetic cystoid macular oedema [^115Az7Fm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Diabetic cystoid macular oedema (CMO) is a condition involving fluid accumulation in the inner portion of the retina. It often follows changes in retinal blood vessels that cause fluid to leak out. Although it may be asymptomatic, symptoms primarily include painless loss of central vision and often complaints of seeing black spots in front of the eye. CMO may resolve spontaneously or fluctuate for months before causing vision loss. If left untreated or undiagnosed, the progression of CMO can lead to permanent visual loss. Patients with diabetic retinopathy have elevated inflammatory markers; hence, inflammation likely aids in the progression of vascular disease in these patients. Several topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ketorolac 0.5%, bromfenac 0.09%, and nepafenac 0.1%, have been used topically to treat chronic diabetic CMO. This review was conducted to determine the effects of topical NSAIDs in diabetic CMO.

- **Objective**: To assess the effects of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for diabetic cystoid macular oedema (CMO).

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014, Issue 12), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to January 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2015), and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to January 2015).

### Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor for proliferative diabetic retinopathy [^116WMzvV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is an advanced complication of diabetic retinopathy that can cause blindness. It consists of the presence of new vessels in the retina and vitreous haemorrhage. Although panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) is the treatment of choice for PDR, it has secondary effects that can affect vision. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF), which inhibits vascular proliferation, could improve the vision of people with PDR.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of anti-VEGFs for PDR and summarise any relevant economic evaluations of their use.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2022, Issue 6), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the ISRCTN registry, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP. We did not use any date or language restrictions. We last searched the electronic databases on 1 June 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing anti-VEGFs to another active treatment, sham treatment, or no treatment for people with PDR. We also included studies that assessed the combination of anti-VEGFs with other treatments. We excluded studies that used anti-VEGFs in people undergoing vitrectomy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias (RoB) for all included trials. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) or the mean difference (MD), and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^115wx29z]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for diabetic retinopathy, more specifically concerning vision rehabilitation, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend counseling patients experiencing vision loss from diabetes on the availability and scope of vision rehabilitation care. Patients should be provided with, or referred for, a comprehensive evaluation of visual impairment by a practitioner experienced in vision rehabilitation. They should also be given educational materials and resources for eye care support, in addition to self-management education focused on glycemic management and hypoglycemia awareness.

### The evolving treatment of diabetic retinopathy [^115GhBqa]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

When the results of the ETDRS were published in 1985, focal laser treatment for diabetic macular edema (DME) became established as the standard of care for the next 30 years. However, it was evident during this era that more effective therapy was needed. Consequently, pharmacological and surgical therapies were investigated.

Pharmacotherapy for both diabetic retinopathy (DR) and DME can be subdivided by class of drugs and methods of delivery. The most important class of drugs is the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents, followed by corticosteroids. Systemic angiotensin receptor blockers and fibrates are significantly less important. Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have proven futile in long-term DME management.

- **Anti-VEGF therapy**: The first anti-VEGF drug used to treat DME was pegaptanib, which selectively blocks the 165 isoform of VEGF. Its promise was superseded by superior results obtained with anti-VEGF drugs that block all isoforms of VEGF. The efficacy of bevacizumab and ranibizumab was proven in randomized-controlled clinical trials in 2010, and that of aflibercept in 2014. Conbercept may prove to be a fifth effective anti-VEGF agent, but a level I randomized clinical trial has not yet been published.

A prospective, randomized, comparative effectiveness trial of bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept showed no difference in efficacy among the three drugs in eyes with center-involved DME and visual acuity of 20/40 or better over one or two years.

### The evolving treatment of diabetic retinopathy [^113dQxsv]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

Approaches aimed at increasing the intravitreal concentration of anti-VEGF agents have not proved beneficial. The READ-3 clinical trial examining two doses of ranibizumab (0.5 and 2.0 mg) in DME showed that at 1-year, there were no significant differences between the two groups. Focal laser added from the outset to anti-VEGF does not improve visual acuity outcomes relative to its use in a deferred manner if incomplete drying of the macula occurs with anti-VEGF therapy. As a result, in 2019, serial anti-VEGF intravitreal injection monotherapy has become the standard of care. Unlike clinical trials, real-world data have demonstrated that a significant portion of patients in clinical practice are undertreated with anti-VEGF and have subsequently lower best corrected visual acuity (BCVA).

In DME patients, post hoc analysis of data from Protocol I of the DRCR Network demonstrated that the initial macular response to three injections of a particular anti-VEGF agent was predictive of long-term outcome. Accordingly, poor responders might potentially benefit from a switch in therapeutic agents.

### Pharmacotherapy for uveitis: Current management and emerging therapy [^114eAKW8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Methotrexate is a folic acid analogue and inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, thus inhibiting DNA reproduction. It is administered weekly either orally or by intramuscular injection at a starting dose of 2.5–10 mg/week and is titrated to effect with a maximum dose of 50 mg/week. One study demonstrated control of ocular inflammation in 76% of patients at a mean dose of 12.3 mg/week. It has a lag time of 3–6 weeks from initiation of treatment to full therapeutic effect. Its efficacy has been demonstrated in a variety of uveitis entities in several retrospective reviews, and in the SITE retrospective cohort study of 384 patients, ocular inflammatory disease was suppressed in 66% of patients at 1 year, allowing for tapering of steroids to 10 mg/day in 58%. Successful outcomes were observed in a variety of conditions, with the highest rates in anterior uveitis and scleritis. Side effects include gastrointestinal symptoms, cytopenia, and hepatotoxicity, with abnormal liver function observed in 15% of patients. No increased risk of neoplasia has been demonstrated with long-term use.

Mycophenolate mofetil is an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor that disrupts purine synthesis and preferentially inhibits DNA synthesis by B- and T-cells. It is administered orally at a starting dose of 500 mg twice daily and is increased to 1 g twice daily after 2 weeks, provided that side effects are acceptable with regular monitoring of blood count and liver function tests. Efficacy is achieved within 2–12 weeks after commencing treatment. In one study, 65% of patients…

### Systemic adverse events among patients with diabetes treated with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections [^114jK77c]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents are currently the mainstay of treatment for diabetic retinopathy (DR). Although effective, data on their systemic safety remain inconclusive, particularly in high-risk patient groups.

The objective of this study is to explore the systemic safety of intravitreal anti-VEGF agents among patients with diabetes.

This research was a retrospective, longitudinal population-based analysis of the Corporate Data Warehouse, which is a large-scale database of patients within the US Veteran Health Affairs. All patients 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes who were seen at any Veterans Affairs health care facility in the US between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2012, were identified. Data were then extracted on incident systemic adverse events among this patient cohort from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2017. All individuals with diabetes who did and did not receive anti-VEGF injections were included. Patients with a history of prior systemic adverse events and those who received an intravitreal injection between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2012, were excluded. Data were analyzed from October 2019 to March 2023.

- **Exposure**: Anti-VEGF injection.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Proportion of patients with any incident systemic adverse event, acute myocardial infarction, cardiovascular disease, or kidney disease at 1-, 3-, and 5-year follow-up.

The study included a total of 1,731,782 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.8 [12.3] years; 1,656,589 [95.7%] male) with type 2 diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy was present in 476,013 patients (27.5%).

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^1141t3jb]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, specifically in managing diabetic retinopathy, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend considering macular focal/grid photocoagulation or administering intravitreal injections of corticosteroids. These treatments are advised for patients with persistent diabetic macular edema who do not respond to previous anti-VEGF therapy or for those ineligible for this first-line approach.

### Intraocular methotrexate can induce extended remission in some patients in noninfectious uveitis [^111gc9Qv]. Retina (2013). Low credibility.

To assess the outcomes of the intravitreal administration of methotrexate in uveitis, a multicenter, retrospective interventional case series of patients with noninfectious uveitis was conducted. Thirty-eight eyes of 30 patients were enrolled, including a total of 54 intravitreal injections of methotrexate at a dose of 400 µg in 0.1 mL. The primary outcome measure was visual acuity. Secondary outcome measures included control of intraocular inflammation and cystoid macular edema, time to relapse, development of adverse events, and levels of systemic corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy.

Methotrexate proved effective in controlling intraocular inflammation and improving vision in 30 of 38 eyes (79%). The side effect profile was good, with no reported serious ocular adverse events and only one patient having an intraocular pressure of > 21 mmHg. Of the 30 eyes that responded to treatment, 8 relapsed, but 22 (73%) entered an extended period of remission, with the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median time to relapse for the whole group being 17 months. The eight eyes that relapsed were reinjected and all responded to treatment. One eye relapsed at 3 months, but 7 eyes again entered extended remission. Of the 14 patients on systemic therapy at the start of the study, 8 (57%) were able to significantly reduce this following intravitreal methotrexate injection.

In conclusion, in patients with uveitis and uveitic cystoid macular edema, intravitreal MTX can effectively improve visual acuity and reduce cystoid macular edema and, in some patients, allows the reduction of systemic therapy following treatment.

### Using the past to inform the future: Anti-VEGF therapy as a road map to develop novel therapies for diabetic retinopathy [^113ra6zv]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Although significant success is apparent with anti-VEGF therapy, a number of limitations exist. These include the need for repeat intraocular injections, potential disease rebound upon discontinuing treatment, and the fact that not all patients respond to the treatment. These collectively justify the investigation of novel therapies for diabetic retinopathy (DR).

In addition to VEGF, numerous factors have been identified as contributing to the vascular dysfunction observed in DR. The pathology of the diabetic retina is complex, involving regions lacking vascular perfusion and degeneration, as well as regions exhibiting vascular growth and responsiveness to VEGF.

- **Novel targets to support or replace anti-VEGF agents**: The first category includes targets downstream of VEGF signaling. Factors in this category may provide additive benefits to anti-VEGF strategies through improved pharmacokinetic or drug delivery options, such as an orally available alternative to repeat intraocular injections of anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies. The second category includes novel proangiogenic factors distinct from VEGF, with unique signaling mechanisms contributing to blood-retinal barrier dysfunction and angiogenesis. Finally, extracellular inflammatory factors that contribute to vascular permeability or vascular degeneration are discussed. Importantly, drugs for DR may be considered for systemic or local delivery. Local delivery provides a number of potential advantages.

### Intravitreal methotrexate infusion for proliferative vitreoretinopathy [^115xYD4M]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) remains a challenging complication following retinal detachment (RD) repair surgery. The favorable outcomes for this series of high-risk eyes treated for RD with pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and intravitreal methotrexate infusion (IMI) justify a more rigorous, controlled, prospective study of IMI efficacy. Furthermore, given the low risk of intravitreal methotrexate (MTX) administration observed both in this study and in the literature for alternate indications, off-label IMI may be considered during RD repair surgery in scenarios where patients are considered at very high risk of developing PVR, such as a history of severe contralateral PVR or a known history of posterior uveitis.

### A caveat about financial incentives for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy for diabetic retinopathy [^114PYFuL]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

To highlight the financial incentive to the physician of choosing an intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-based strategy for treating non-proliferative and proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and its possible risks to the patient and costs to the healthcare system, this study presents a perspective with retrospective cost and profit analysis.

- **Methods**: Review and synthesis of selected literature on the treatment of diabetic retinopathy are conducted, with interpretation of activity-based and time-based costing of an intravitreal aflibercept strategy for diabetic retinopathy. Data from the DRCR Retina Network Protocols W and AB and the PANORAMA trial were used to illustrate the potential financial incentive underlying such a treatment strategy.

- **Results**: Physician treatment algorithms for diabetic vitreous hemorrhage and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy may be influenced by the substantial financial incentives that intravitreal aflibercept strategies present, despite functional equivalence with alternative and less profitable strategies. For example, pursuing an intravitreal aflibercept-based strategy for diabetic vitreous hemorrhage presents a 76% increased profit over pars plana vitrectomy with laser, with equivalent functional outcomes. For non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, preventative aflibercept injections represent a potential 414% increase in profit over observation and an increased cost of $12,164 to $17,542 over 2 years per patient, with no improvement in visual function. These findings demonstrate that there may be misaligned financial incentives.

### Postoperative methotrexate to reduce reoperation rate and improve vision in patients with complex retinal detachments, advanced diabetic retinopathy, and trauma [^112e9KZ8]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2025). High credibility.

The purpose of this study was to identify the potential benefits of postoperative intravitreal (IVT) methotrexate (MTX) for proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), trauma, or advanced diabetic retinopathy (DR). A retrospective chart review was conducted on previously unoperated eyes at high risk for failure due to preexisting PVR, trauma, or advanced DR. Patients included had retinal detachment (RD) surgery for the following reasons: failed previous retinal reattachment surgery, advanced proliferative DR (PDR), initial surgery for RD associated with trauma, or primary RD associated with grade C PVR. Methotrexate, ranging from 200 to 400 µg, was administered intravitreally at postoperative weeks 1, 2, 4, 7, and 11.

Data analyzed included the reoperation rate, visual acuity (VA), physical examination findings, and optical coherence tomography biomarkers. Of the 255 eyes evaluated, 94 received IVT MTX (MTX group) and 161 eyes did not (control group). The mean number of reoperations was 0.39 in the MTX group and 0.94 in the control group (P < .01). The MTX group showed a mean gain in VA of 1 line, compared to a mean loss of 2.9 lines in the control group (P < .01). Postoperative IVT MTX in eyes with advanced PDR or complicated RD yields comparable effective results, including reduced reoperation rates and improved visual acuity.

### Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor for proliferative diabetic retinopathy [^117VXQDa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a complication of diabetic retinopathy that can cause blindness. Although panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) is the treatment of choice for PDR, it has secondary effects that can affect vision. An alternative treatment, such as anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF), which inhibits vascular proliferation, could improve the vision of people with PDR.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of anti-VEGFs for PDR.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014, Issue 3), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to April 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 28 April 2014.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing anti-VEGFs to another active treatment, sham treatment, or no treatment for people with PDR. We also included studies that assessed the combination of anti-VEGFs with other treatments.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias.

### Narrative review of comprehensive management strategies for diabetic retinopathy: Interdisciplinary approaches and future perspectives [^113j4JeL]. BMJ Public Health (2025). Low credibility.

**Anti-VEGF therapy**: Anti-VEGF therapy has emerged as a pivotal advancement in treating diabetic retinopathy (DR), especially diabetic macular oedema (DME) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a significant role in promoting the formation and permeability of blood vessels under both physiological and pathological conditions. In DR, excessive VEGF release leads to the proliferation of abnormal blood vessels and leakage from existing vessels, culminating in vision loss. The introduction of anti-VEGF therapy offers an effective treatment option for DR, directly targeting the disease's underlying vascular abnormalities. Through intraocular injections of anti-VEGF drugs, significant reductions in retinal VEGF levels are achieved, thereby decreasing vascular leakage and inhibiting abnormal neovascularization, ultimately improving or stabilizing vision.

### Intraocular methotrexate for the treatment and prevention of proliferative vitreoretinopathy: A review [^114iiAG9]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to examine the literature on the use of intravitreal methotrexate (IVT MTX) for the treatment and prevention of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR).

- **Methods**: All reports of IVT MTX to treat and prevent PVR published in PubMed, Google Scholar, and EBSCOhost were reviewed, and the relevant studies are included in this report.

- **Results**: The literature search yielded 32 articles describing the use of MTX in PVR. These included preclinical studies, one case report, and several case series. Early studies found that IVT MTX is a promising medication for the treatment and prevention of PVR. MTX works as a potent anti-inflammatory agent through a new mechanism of action different from that of other medications used in PVR. Few side effects have been reported, mostly limited to mild reversible corneal keratopathy. There are two ongoing randomized controlled clinical trials to further evaluate the efficacy of MTX for PVR.

- **Conclusions**: MTX is a safe and potentially efficacious medication for the treatment and prevention of PVR. Additional clinical trials are needed to further establish this effect.

### Treatment patterns and persistence rates with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment for diabetic macular oedema in the UK: A real-world study [^116s6a9r]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

In recent years, diabetes mellitus has become a global health problem. In 2019, 5.9% of the UK population had been diagnosed with diabetes. Diabetic macular oedema (DME), which is defined as retinal thickening caused by the accumulation of intraretinal fluid, is the most common cause of visual impairment in patients with diabetes, with a prevalence of 6.8–10.4%. In 2014, approximately 21 million people had DME worldwide, a figure that is expected to rise with the increasing prevalence of diabetes.

The European Society of Retina Specialists guidelines recommend the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) combined with fluorescein angiography and fundus biomicroscopy to diagnose DME. In combination with visual acuity (VA) measurements, OCT biomarkers (including central retinal thickness [CRT] and intraretinal fluid) and clinical examination are recommended for monitoring disease progression and supporting treatment decisions in clinical practice. Although laser photocoagulation is still used to treat DME, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) intravitreal injections are now considered the standard of care in eyes with centre-affecting DME affecting vision. Anti-VEGF treatment initiation requires a loading phase of three or more consecutive monthly injections, followed by a maintenance phase during which intervals between injections are titrated to match the patient's needs. Additional treatment (e.g. laser or steroid injection) may also be included.

Clinical trials have demonstrated that improvements in VA are possible with adherence to fixed and flexible dosing regimens.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^11611UTz]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

When considering diagnostic investigations for type 2 diabetes mellitus, particularly screening for diabetic retinopathy, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining screenings every 1–2 years if there is no evidence of retinopathy from one or more annual eye exams and glycemic indicators are within the goal range. If any level of diabetic retinopathy is present, subsequent dilated retinal examinations should be conducted at least annually by an ophthalmologist or optometrist. More frequent examinations by an ophthalmologist are advised if retinopathy is progressing or sight-threatening.

### Treatment patterns and persistence rates with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment for diabetic macular oedema in the UK: A real-world study [^1161wimr]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The mean number of injections per patient eye observed in the first 3 months of treatment (3.1 injections) indicates that patients attending UK NHS clinics received loading doses in accordance with label recommendations and clinical guidelines of treatment with anti-VEGF therapy. The mean number of injections per patient eye in the first year of treatment (7.7 injections) was similar to those observed in the POLARIS (7.4 injections) and the Moorfields Eye Hospital studies (6.7 injections). In addition, the majority (55.7%) of injections within the first 3 months were administered in intervals of 4–6 weeks, suggesting that patients were adequately treated.

Owing to the heterogeneity of the data, it was not possible to determine whether pro re nata or T&E regimens were applied at these sites. The high number of total clinic visits and moderate number of injection-free visits observed may be due to other ocular and general comorbidities and suggest that treatment for DME was individualized. Patients with diabetes have complex comorbidity profiles, including cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases, which might not allow injections to be given at certain times and may contribute to the total number of clinic visits. These patients also have high healthcare utilization. In addition, fewer injections were given in the second year of treatment than the first (mean, 5.6 vs. 7.7), although the total number of injection and injection-free visits remained high (mean, 13.4 vs. 14.2). These data further highlight the need for longer-acting treatments to reduce the burden of DME.

### A paradigm shift in the management approaches of proliferative diabetic retinopathy: Role of anti-VEGF therapy [^111hr9YK]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Low credibility.

For the majority of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) cases, the mainstay treatment remains laser therapy. However, there is growing evidence on the benefits offered by anti-VEGF injections, regardless of the presence or absence of diabetic macula oedema (DME). As the treatment landscape for PDR is evolving, this narrative review aims to combine currently available knowledge on anti-VEGF agents and their role in the management of PDR. It emphasizes the risk-benefit evaluation of various approaches employed for PDR management and discusses consensus statements for managing several clinical scenarios in the context of PDR.

### Executive summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2009 [^116yeoJc]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

- **Retinopathy screening and treatment**: To reduce the risk or slow the progression of retinopathy, optimize glycemic control (A). To reduce the risk or slow the progression of retinopathy, optimize blood pressure control (A).

- **Screening**:
	- Adults and children aged 10 years or older with type 1 diabetes should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist within 5 years after the onset of diabetes (B).
	- Patients with type 2 diabetes should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist shortly after the diagnosis of diabetes (B).
	- Subsequent examinations for type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients should be repeated annually by an ophthalmologist or optometrist. Less frequent exams (every 2–3 years) may be considered following one or more normal eye exams. Examinations will be required more frequently if retinopathy is progressing (B).
	- Women with preexisting diabetes who are planning pregnancy or who have become pregnant should have a comprehensive eye examination and be counseled on the risk of development and/or progression of diabetic retinopathy. The eye examination should occur in the first trimester with close follow-up throughout pregnancy and for 1 year postpartum (B).

- **Treatment**: Promptly refer patients with any level of macular edema, severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), or any proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) to an ophthalmologist who is knowledgeable and experienced in the management and treatment of diabetic retinopathy (A).

**Diabetic retinopathy (DR)**: The recommended dose for Eylea is 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution), administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (approximately every 28 days) for the first 5 injections. This is followed by a dose of 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) via intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks (2 months). Although Eylea may be dosed as frequently as 2 mg every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days), additional efficacy was not demonstrated in most patients when dosed every 4 weeks compared to every 8 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. Some patients may require every 4-week (monthly) dosing after the initial 20 weeks (5 months).

### What is the evidence for systemic effects of intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, and should we be concerned [^111j9247]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

As an earlier adopter of off-label bevacizumab for retinal disease, I witnessed firsthand the significant improvements this class of agents offered over our previous treatments. However, since bevacizumab had not undergone the usual FDA approval process for intravitreal use, I was vigilant in observing any signs of systemic effects. In 2006, I reported several patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) who exhibited changes in the fellow eye a week following a bevacizumab injection. If these observations were indeed due to the small amount of drug released into systemic circulation, I reasoned that we must have been using much higher doses than necessary to inhibit retinal neovascularization in the injected eye. Consequently, I reduced the injected dose of bevacizumab by 200-fold to 6.25 µg and still observed an effect on leakage of neovascularization in the injected eye. Although many fellow eye cases have now been reported, and I have observed it with ranibizumab, aflibercept, and bevacizumab, most clinicians have not seen fellow eye effects and discount the plausibility that they occur.

### Systemic and intraocular methotrexate for the prevention and treatment of proliferative vitreoretinopathy in children with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and underlying inflammatory disease [^113nnbMt]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

This index study highlights the efficacy and safety of a combined surgical and medical therapy using intraocular and systemic methotrexate for pediatric rhegmatogenous retinal detachments (RRD) complicated by proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Three pediatric patients with RRD complicated by PVR, in the context of underlying atopic dermatitis and/or uveitis, were treated with a combination of vitreoretinal surgery and intraoperative intravitreal methotrexate (MTX) infusion (40mg). This was followed by at least one injection of 200 μg of MTX into the silicone oil-filled vitreous cavity. Additionally, the patients received short-term systemic immunosuppression with systemic MTX (oral or subcutaneous 20 mg weekly for 12 weeks) and/or steroids.

Retinal reattachment with improvement in visual acuity was achieved in all eyes following a single surgery and was maintained until the final follow-up examination after oil removal. No side effects of intraocular or systemic MTX were observed.

The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy suggest that it could be a successful strategy for treating pediatric patients with RRD, with or without PVR, in the presence or absence of underlying inflammatory diseases.

### Reduced frequency of intravitreal methotrexate injection lowers the risk of keratopathy in vitreoretinal lymphoma patients [^113Ubjba]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

All patients diagnosed with vitreoretinal lymphoma received intravitreal injections of methotrexate combined with systemic therapy. The study population was divided into two groups according to different treatment protocols:

- **Group A**: This group included 14 patients (22 eyes) treated with intravitreal methotrexate according to the induction-consolidation-maintenance regimen. In Group A, 12 eyes (54.5%) completed the regimen.
- **Group B**: This group consisted of 6 patients (8 eyes) treated with an induction-maintenance regimen. These patients started on the treatment protocol but switched directly to monthly injections (9 months) upon achieving ocular remission due to their inability to tolerate high-frequency treatment. Six eyes (75%) completed the induction-maintenance regimen in Group B.

Twelve eyes (10 in Group A, 2 in Group B) did not complete the entire treatment but still achieved ocular clinical remission. Data from 3 eyes (21, 22A, and 22B) were missing due to severe systemic complications caused by the progression of intracranial lesions. Thirty eyes showed a complete resolution of malignant cells in the vitreous on B-scan ultrasound exams during follow-up. Ocular remission was obtained after an average of 8.2 injections (SD = 4.6, range 3–20).

Nine patients (14 eyes) with recurrence of CNS lymphoma achieved ocular remission after an average of 11.2 injections (SD = 5.0).

### Effect of intravitreal injection of methotrexate on human corneal endothelial cells [^117TBCar]. Cornea (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the toxic effect of intravitreal methotrexate on human corneal endothelium.

In this prospective, noncomparative interventional case series, an intravitreal injection of 400 μg methotrexate was performed in eyes with persistent diabetic macular edema. Corneal endothelial cell analyses and central corneal thickness measurements were conducted before and 1, 3, and 6 months after the injections, using noncontact specular microscopy.

A total of 21 eyes from 18 patients, with a mean age of 60.5 ± 6.8 years, were evaluated. No statistically significant differences were found in endothelial cell density, coefficient of variation, average cell area, hexagonality, and central corneal thickness measurements before and after the injections (P = 0.70, 0.39, 0.43, 0.64, and 0.67, respectively).

In conclusion, this 6-month follow-up study indicates that intravitreal injection of 400 μg methotrexate has no significant effect on corneal endothelial cell measurements performed via specular microscopy.

### Treatment cessation in patients with diabetic maculopathy under intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy following a treat-and-extend protocol [^11772Fui]. Ophthalmology Science (2025). Low credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a progressive, potentially blinding disease and a primary cause of visual handicap in working-age individuals between 20 and 65 years. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a manifestation of DR occurring in all stages of DR. The global population with DR is estimated to increase by 55% from 2020 to 2045, and the global number of adults with clinically significant DME will rise by 51.9% to 28.6 million in 2045.

Diabetic macular edema shows some pathophysiological similarities with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). VEGF has been recognized as a key driver of increased vascular permeability, inflammation, and neovascularization in both diseases. Consequently, intravitreal anti-VEGF therapies have evolved as first-line therapy in these conditions, as they not only prevent blindness but also improve visual acuity (VA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) in a majority of instances in the long term. While clear guidelines exist for the initiation and long-term treatment of nAMD, including a loading phase with merely 3 monthly anti-VEGF injections followed by an individualized proactive therapy following a treat-and-extend (T&E) protocol, there is less agreement in DME regarding treatment initiation, the number of injections during the loading phase, the use of pro- or reactive treatment protocols (fixed treatment or T&E compared with pro re nata or as needed), and of treatment alternatives, that is, corticosteroids, as a second-line therapy.

In a previous study, 32% and 40% of our own patients with DME under a pro re nata and T&E protocol received treatment, highlighting variability in patient response and management strategies.

### The safety of intraocular methotrexate in silicone-filled eyes [^114SvwwV]. Retina (2008). Low credibility.

Intraocular methotrexate has been safely used in eyes with primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL), and in eyes with uveitis and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Dosing in silicone-filled eyes was reduced from a standard 400 microg intravitreal injection due to concerns of toxicity. The present study reports the visual results of non-PCNSL, silicone-filled eyes treated with intravitreal methotrexate using cumulative dosages ranging from 200 microg to 1,200 microg.

- **Method**: In this retrospective case series, all patients with silicone-filled eyes who received intraocular methotrexate were included. Patients were observed with serial ophthalmic examinations. Best-corrected visual acuity was measured by Snellen acuity. Pretreatment acuities were compared to those obtained at last follow-up.

- **Results**: The cohort included 12 patients (13 eyes) with disease other than PCNSL. The cumulative dose of intraocular methotrexate in any one patient ranged from 200 microg to 1,200 microg. Mean follow-up was 9 months (median, 10 months; range, 2 weeks to 16 months). Best-corrected vision at last follow-up was either stable or improved from pretreatment acuity in 12 of 13 eyes.

- **Conclusion**: Preservation of acuity in 12 of 13 study eyes suggests that intravitreal methotrexate in a cumulative dose of up to 1,200 microg is safe in silicone-filled eyes.

### Birdshot uveitis: Current and emerging treatment options [^111UuLMz]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Intravitreal non-corticosteroid therapy has gained popularity to mitigate the side effects associated with intraocular corticosteroids. Recently, intraocular methotrexate has undergone assessment for its efficacy in treating uveitis. One prospective clinical trial demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing posterior segment inflammation. Additionally, a larger collaborative series suggested that methotrexate might induce longer-term remission in certain patients; however, there is no direct evidence supporting its use specifically for birdshot chorioretinopathy (BSCR).

- **Vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition**: Neither bevacizumab nor ranibizumab have shown considerable effectiveness as a therapeutic approach.

- **TNF-α inhibition**: Local inhibition using intraocular infliximab appeared promising, but clinical trial results were mixed. Consequently, there is a call for restricting its use to well-designed trials, similar to adalimumab. However, recent preclinical studies on the TNF inhibitor ESBA105 indicate good bioavailability from topical administration, suggesting that this antibody fragment might bypass the issues encountered with full-sized molecules.

Sirolimus, also known as rapamycin, presents another potential non-corticosteroid therapy. It inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) by binding to the immunophilin FK protein 12 (FKBP-12), disrupting T-cell activation and proliferation. Additionally, it suppresses T-cell proliferation via the inhibition of IL-2, IL-4, and IL-15. A Phase II study of the intravitreal and subconjunctival administration of sirolimus yielded encouraging results.

### Association between systemic methotrexate therapy and proliferative vitreoretinopathy [^113hA7nc]. Ophthalmology Retina (2025). High credibility.

Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is a major cause for failure of retinal detachment (RD) repair. This study aimed to determine if patients taking systemic methotrexate (MTX) therapy had a lower incidence of PVR.

- **Design**: Multicenter retrospective cohort study.

- **Participants**: Patients aged ≥ 18 years documented in the Sight Outcomes Research Collaborative (SOURCE) repository with a diagnosis of RD and who underwent RD repair surgery between 2004 and 2024. Only patients who had been in the SOURCE system for at least 6 months before the diagnosis date and had no prior record of RD repair surgery were included. Patients with unknown laterality of the primary RD repair, history of PVR, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, serous RD, retinal dialysis, or ocular trauma were excluded.

- **Methods**: The exposure variable was systemic MTX use, as documented from the medication list. The outcome of interest was new-onset PVR within 6 months of surgery. Incident PVR was modeled using log binomial regression models, which included terms for systemic MTX use and method of primary RD repair. Regression models incorporated inverse probability weights based on propensity scores for systemic MTX use. Similar analyses were conducted for other antimetabolite agents such as azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil.

- **Main outcome measures**: Cumulative incidence of PVR and adjusted risk ratio (RR) of developing PVR within 6 months of the initial RD.

Results indicated that out of the 2674 eligible patients, 48 (1.8%) were taking systemic MTX at the time of RD repair.

### Protective role of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) in early phase of experimental diabetic retinopathy [^112jf1Y9]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2009). High credibility.

Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is the most potent inhibitor of angiogenesis in the mammalian eye, suggesting that PEDF may protect against proliferative diabetic retinopathy. However, a role for PEDF in early diabetic retinopathy remains to be elucidated. We investigated here whether and how PEDF could prevent the development of diabetic retinopathy.

- **Methods**: Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were treated with or without intravenous injection of PEDF for 4 weeks. Early neuronal derangements were evaluated by electroretinogram (ERG) and immunofluorescent staining of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Expression of PEDF and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a marker of oxidative stress, was localized by immunofluorescence. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and p22phox expression were evaluated with western blots. Breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) was quantified with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated dextran. NADPH oxidase activity was measured with lucigenin luminescence.

- **Results**: Retinal PEDF levels were reduced, and amplitudes of a- and b-wave in the ERG were decreased in diabetic rats, which were in parallel with GFAP overexpression in the Müller cells. Furthermore, retinal 8-OHdG, p22phox, and VEGF levels and NADPH oxidase activity were increased, and BRB was broken in diabetic rats. Administration of PEDF ameliorated all of the characteristic changes in early diabetic retinopathy.

- **Conclusions**: Results suggest that PEDF could prevent neuronal derangements and vascular hyperpermeability in early diabetic retinopathy.

### Role of systemic factors in improving the prognosis of diabetic retinal disease and predicting response to diabetic retinopathy treatment [^117J2KaT]. Ophthalmology Science (2024). Low credibility.

We assigned specific factors to individual teams of the working group. We asked each team to conduct a pragmatic literature search and document the relevant output in a standardized Evidence Grid based on the US Food and Drug Administration Biomarker Qualification guidelines, rather than conducting a fully documented systematic review of the literature to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) standards. This approach was chosen because the timescale and resources available did not support a PRISMA approach. The search terms for these individual systemic risk factor literature reviews are provided in Methods S1 (available online).

The lead team for each systemic factor agreed upon and completed a standardized Evidence Grid (see Results S1 section, available online) and provided a short textual summary of key conclusions regarding whether consistent associations were found between individual systemic factors and the onset or progression of diabetic retinal disease (DRD). The literature was summarized using a modified biomarker evaluation nomenclature: "1A" denoting consistent evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational cohort studies, "1C" denoting consistent evidence from observational cohort studies, "2C" denoting some evidence but inconsistent from observational cohort studies, and "None" denoting no evidence from observational cohort studies or trials as yet. We consider strong evidence to be at level "1A" and moderate evidence to be at level "1C". We then conducted a more formal search of the literature on the subject.

### The role of methotrexate in resolving ocular inflammation after specific therapy for presumed latent syphilitic uveitis and presumed tuberculosis-related uveitis [^11322Bvt]. Retina (2014). Low credibility.

This study was designed to investigate whether the anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative activity of oral and intravitreal methotrexate (MTX) suppresses intraocular inflammation in patients with presumed latent syphilitic uveitis and presumed tuberculosis-related uveitis.

- **Methods**: Interventional prospective study including three cases with presumed latent syphilitic uveitis treated with intravenous penicillin and oral MTX, and two cases with presumed tuberculosis-related uveitis treated with standard antituberculosis therapy and intravitreal MTX injections. Treatment efficacy of all cases was assessed by best-corrected visual acuity, fundus fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography.

- **Results**: Four eyes of three patients with presumed latent syphilitic uveitis had improved best-corrected visual acuity, suppression of intraocular inflammation, and resolution of cystoid macular edema in 6 months with oral MTX therapy. No recurrence of intraocular inflammation was observed in 6 to 18 months of follow-up after cessation of MTX. Two eyes of two patients with presumed tuberculosis-related uveitis showed improved best-corrected visual acuity, suppression of intraocular inflammation, and resolution of cystoid macular edema after intravitreal injections of MTX. No recurrence of intraocular inflammation was observed in 6 to 8 months of follow-up after cessation of antituberculous therapy.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^114EBcpa]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for diabetic retinopathy, specifically in relation to laser photocoagulation, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend performing panretinal laser photocoagulation therapy. This procedure is advised to reduce the risk of vision loss in patients with high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy and, in some cases, severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy.

### Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor pharmacotherapy for diabetic macular edema: a report by the American Academy of Ophthalmology [^116xFyke]. Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

To review the evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pharmacotherapies for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME), literature searches were conducted in September 2011. These searches took place in PubMed without date restrictions, limited to articles published in English, and in the Cochrane Library without language limitations. The combined searches yielded 532 citations, of which 45 were deemed clinically relevant for full-text review. Ratings of the level of evidence were assigned to each of the selected studies with guidance from panel methodologists.

At this time, there are five studies that provide level I evidence for intravitreal ranibizumab, alone or in combination with other treatments for DME. There is also one study that provides level I evidence for intravitreal pegaptanib sodium for DME. Nine studies reviewed were rated as level II, and two additional studies were graded as level III. Most studies do not provide information about long-term results (i.e. more than two years of follow-up) or the comparative efficacy of anti-VEGF pharmacotherapies.

A review of the available literature indicates that anti-VEGF pharmacotherapy, delivered by intravitreal injection, is a safe and effective treatment over two years for DME. Further evidence is required to support the long-term safety of these pharmacotherapies and their comparative efficacy.

### The association of intravitreal anti-VEGF injections with kidney function in diabetic retinopathy [^113njKw4]. Ophthalmology Science (2023). Low credibility.

Intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy has revolutionized the treatment paradigms for numerous retinal conditions and is now widely used in the treatment of sight-threatening complications of diabetic retinopathy, including proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and diabetic macular edema (DME). Aflibercept and ranibizumab have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to treat both PDR and DME, while bevacizumab is commonly used off-label as a cost-effective alternative. Since there is widespread adoption of these agents in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy, the investigation of the potential toxicities related to their use is essential to improve the care of patients with diabetic retinopathy.

Prior studies demonstrated that patients who received systemic administration of anti-VEGF agents developed arterial thromboembolic events, proteinuria, and worsening hypertension. Possible mechanisms of kidney injury include glomerular thrombotic microangiopathy, endothelial dysfunction, and microvascular dysfunction. Though these agents are administered intravitreally in relatively small doses, limited case reports suggested a potential association between intravitreal anti-VEGF administration and kidney function decline. While a recent retrospective cohort study suggested that there is no increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events with intravitreal therapy, less is known about the risk of kidney function decline in a large cohort of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and/or DME. To address this, we performed an institutional retrospective analysis.

### Ocular anti-VEGF therapy for diabetic retinopathy: Overview of clinical efficacy and evolving applications [^1117Fj78]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Ocular anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy represents one of the most significant advances in modern medicine. The introduction and widespread use of ocular anti-VEGF therapy for age-related macular degeneration heralded a new era in the treatment of vascular and exudative diseases of the retina. Its expanding indications now include diabetic macular edema and proliferative diabetic retinopathy, two vision-threatening forms of diabetic retinopathy. It is widely anticipated that ocular anti-VEGF therapy could spark a dramatic shift in the treatment paradigm for diabetic retinopathy.

However, despite its clear efficacy shown in clinical trials, the dynamic landscape of evolving medical, ethical, and economic issues related to this new treatment suggests significant challenges ahead. In this article, we provide a discussion of this topic as part of this two-part Bench to Clinic narrative.

- **Evidence from clinical trials**: Our Clinic contribution provides an overview of the evidence on anti-VEGF therapy for diabetic retinopathy and highlights the hopes and fears of this new treatment from clinical and public health standpoints. In the Bench narrative that precedes this contribution, Simó et al. provide an overview of the role of VEGF in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy.

### American society of retina specialists clinical practice guidelines on the management of nonproliferative and proliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema [^116bTRx4]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Nonproliferative (NPDR) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) without diabetic macular edema (DME) affect millions of individuals living with diabetes throughout the world. There is increasing data on various management strategies for such patients, but there is limited consensus on how the data should be adopted into clinical practice.

- **Methods**: This literature review and editorial presents and synthesizes the evidence for various management paradigms for NPDR and PDR without DME.

- **Results**: Retina specialists are an integral member of the diabetes management team, and should encourage patients on the importance of glycemic and cardiovascular optimization for both systemic and retinopathy risk factor reduction. The diabetic retinopathy severity scale (DRSS) is now an approvable endpoint for clinical trials in the United States, therefore becoming more clinically relevant. For PDR without DME, the Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS) and the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) established the standard of care with panretinal photocoagulation (PRP). Laser parameters have since evolved to include less intense and earlier intervention. Studies have recently demonstrated that anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment of PDR is effective at regressing neovascularization and improving DRSS levels in many patients. Further evidence is required to determine optimal treatment frequency, duration, and retreatment criteria in the real world. There are concerns for adverse events in patients being lost to follow-up during anti-VEGF treatment.

### Local therapies for inflammatory eye disease in translation: past, present and future [^112nbkEb]. BMC Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Intraocular methotrexate has long been used to treat intraocular lymphomas associated with primary central nervous system lymphoma, but has more recently been tried in uveitis. In one prospective study, it was found to be effective in reducing vitritis and macular oedema without raising the IOP in patients with a history of steroid response. Interestingly, the onset of effect was within one week and lasted approximately three months, with no statistical difference between the best visual acuity obtained after methotrexate injection and after previous corticosteroid treatment, including IVTA injection. A larger collaborative series is currently in press and has suggested that this drug may induce longer-term remission in some patients.

There is some published evidence of the successful use of cyclosporine-loaded poly(lactic co-glycolic) spheres in animal models, but this has not been successfully translated into the treatment of human disease. Intravitreal tacrolimus has shared a similar fate.

Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents have also been tried as a non-corticosteroid intraocular treatment for uveitic CME, owing to their induction in inflammation, their role in increasing vascular permeability, and the finding of increased levels in eyes with uveitic macular oedema. Several small retrospective studies have been reported using both bevacizumab and ranibizumab, although bevacizumab is more commonly used owing to its lower cost. Intravitreal bevacizumab does appear effective in reducing central macula.

### The evolving treatment of diabetic retinopathy [^116vuXPL]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

With the recent expansion of management options for diabetic retinopathy, optimal sequences of treatment application and combination in specific clinical situations are under investigation. A review and synthesis of the ophthalmologic literature on the treatment of diabetic retinopathy was performed to provide perspective on the relative prioritization of the various treatments in the contexts seen in clinical practice. In general, pharmacotherapy is ascendant, particularly with the anti-VEGF class, while laser treatment continues to have lesser roles in specific situations and under certain economic constraints. Surgical intervention continues to be reserved for those situations which fail to respond to pharmacotherapy, laser, or combination therapy.

Ongoing refinements in the systemic management of both hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia continue to demonstrate significant benefits for both diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema. Recent developments involving newer retinal diagnostics are proving beneficial in optimizing both initiation and maintenance of therapy. Additionally, recent advances in novel pharmaceutical agents and ocular drug delivery methods show promise in better controlling the disease as well as reducing the burden of treatment.

### Eylea [^114E6gow]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In the VIVID and VISTA studies, an efficacy outcome was the change in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale (ETDRS-DRSS). The ETDRS-DRSS score was assessed at baseline and approximately every six months thereafter for the duration of the studies [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. All enrolled patients had diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) at baseline. The majority of patients enrolled in these studies (77%) had moderate-to-severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) based on the ETDRS-DRSS. At week 100, the proportion of patients improving by at least two steps on the ETDRS-DRSS was significantly greater in both EYLEA treatment groups (2Q4 and 2Q8) when compared to the control group.

- **Table of results**: Results from the analysis of ETDRS-DRSS at week 100 in the VIVID and VISTA studies are shown in Table 9 below.

Results of the evaluable subgroups (e.g. age, gender, race, baseline HbA1c, and baseline visual acuity) on the proportion of patients who achieved a ≥ 2-step improvement on the ETDRS-DRSS from baseline to week 100 were, in general, consistent with those in the overall population.

### Advances in the medical treatment of diabetic retinopathy [^115wyuqj]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Intravitreous anti-VEGF agents have become pivotal in the management of diabetic retinopathy. VEGF is recognized for its significant involvement in the development of diabetic retinopathy, evidenced by heightened levels in animals with experimental diabetes and in the vitreous of patients with diabetic retinopathy. The administration of intravitreous VEGF in experimental animals replicates numerous characteristics of diabetic retinopathy. Consequently, agents that diminish VEGF activity are compelling, as they effectively reduce permeability and neovascularization, the primary features of diabetic macular edema (DME) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), respectively.

Systemically administered drugs generally access the retinochoroidal tissue via blood circulation. However, due to the blood-retinal barrier (BRB), the influx of drugs into the retina is restricted, necessitating large doses to maintain therapeutic concentrations. For anti-VEGF agents, this could result in widespread inhibition of angiogenesis, potentially impairing crucial vascular responses to ischemic events in diabetic patients with cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease. Additional concerning side effects of systemic VEGF inhibition include hypertension and proteinuria, both surrogate markers, as well as impaired wound healing, which could be particularly detrimental to the diabetic population.

Conversely, local administration through intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents circumvents systemic adverse effects. Though beneficial, this approach is invasive and necessitates a skilled specialist. Furthermore, to sustain effective levels, frequent injections are required, escalating local administration challenges.

### Ozempic [^111sgxbJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Diabetic retinopathy complications**: In a 2-year trial involving patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk, more events of diabetic retinopathy complications occurred in patients treated with Ozempic (3.0%) compared to placebo (1.8%). The absolute risk increase for diabetic retinopathy complications was larger among patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy at baseline (Ozempic 8.2%, placebo 5.2%) than among patients without a known history of diabetic retinopathy (Ozempic 0.7%, placebo 0.4%). Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. The effect of long-term glycemic control with semaglutide on diabetic retinopathy complications has not been studied. Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored for progression of diabetic retinopathy.

- **Never share an Ozempic pen between patients**: Ozempic pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Pen-sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.

- **Hypoglycemia with concomitant use of insulin secretagogues or insulin**: Patients receiving Ozempic in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g. sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Drug Interactions (7)]. The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk.
