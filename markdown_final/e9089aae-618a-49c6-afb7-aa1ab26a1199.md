## Question

Hypertension in diabetes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about blood pressure management in patients with diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how hypertension is defined and how it should be diagnosed in people with diabetes. Then, I should verify what constitutes the appropriate therapeutic targets by age, comorbidity, and tolerance. Next, I will examine treatment initiation thresholds and the choice of first-line agents, including special cases like chronic kidney disease and pregnancy. After that, I should review combination strategies and the role of newer glucose-lowering agents that lower blood pressure. Finally, I will integrate lifestyle measures, monitoring cadence, and practical implementation details to ensure safe, evidence-based care with attention to individualization and shared decision-making [^112yZ4af] [^112HQytv] [^114JAdzV].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework. In people with diabetes, hypertension is defined as a sustained office blood pressure of at least 130/80 mmHg based on the average of two or more measurements on two or more occasions, with confirmation on a separate day when readings are elevated, and I should remember that a single visit diagnosis is acceptable if blood pressure is 180/110 mmHg or higher in the presence of cardiovascular disease, which I need to keep in mind for urgent scenarios [^117GhiTP] [^114it3NW]. Hold on, I should verify the screening cadence; blood pressure should be measured at every routine clinical visit or at least every six months, and home blood pressure monitoring should be encouraged after appropriate education to improve detection and control [^114JAdzV] [^113vbMAX].

> Next, I should review the therapeutic target. The most consistently endorsed on-treatment goal for most adults with diabetes is less than 130/80 mmHg if it can be safely attained, with shared decision-making to individualize based on tolerance, comorbidities, and patient preferences, and I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize this to frail or very elderly patients who may not tolerate it [^112yZ4af] [^115E6VAW] [^114tW7XP]. Wait, let me verify the European perspective; ESH 2023 aligns with a primary target of less than 130/80 mmHg in type 2 diabetes, reinforcing this threshold as a reasonable default when safe [^117BUsva] [^115dXkdu].

> I will now examine age-specific considerations. For adults aged 65 years and older with diabetes, I initially thought the universal target should be less than 130/80 mmHg, but wait, I should double-check because some guidelines recommend a more conservative target of 130–139 mmHg for systolic pressure, with 140/90 mmHg acceptable in those with high disease complexity or frailty, and careful monitoring for orthostatic hypotension is essential in this group [^111PRUs9] [^1179RtRe] [^115wzjaQ]. Hold on, I should verify the VA/DoD stance; they suggest less than 150 mmHg for all patients with diabetes, with less than 140 mmHg as a secondary target if tolerated, which is more conservative than cardiology and endocrine society guidance, so I need to reconcile this by emphasizing individualized targets and close follow-up for adverse effects in older adults [^115QLKwC] [^111RryMb].

> Let me consider special populations. In pregnancy with diabetes and chronic hypertension, I should confirm that the recommended target is 110–135/85 mmHg, with initiation or titration at 140/90 mmHg and deintensification if blood pressure falls below 90/60 mmHg, balancing maternal and fetal risks through shared decision-making [^116aZ28V] [^114u8JmL]. For patients with chronic kidney disease and diabetes, I need to ensure ACE inhibitors or ARBs are prioritized and that the blood pressure target remains less than 130/80 mmHg when feasible, given the renoprotective benefits of RAAS blockade in albuminuric disease [^113Fq6uf] [^115ezbw4].

> Now, I should review treatment initiation thresholds. Pharmacologic therapy should be initiated and titrated to achieve less than 130/80 mmHg when office blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg or higher, and if blood pressure is 150/90 mmHg or higher, I should promptly initiate two drugs or a single-pill combination with timely titration alongside lifestyle therapy to reach goal efficiently and reduce inertia [^1171XHPT] [^112DUdbm]. I need to check the European perspective; ESH 2023 recommends initiating drug treatment at 140/90 mmHg or higher in type 2 diabetes, while acknowledging that many patients will ultimately require intensification to less than 130/80 mmHg, so I should frame 140/90 mmHg as a minimum threshold and 130/80 mmHg as the preferred target when tolerated [^111AWLK1] [^117BUsva].

> Next, I should review first-line pharmacotherapy. For most patients with diabetes and hypertension, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are preferred first-line because of their cardiorenal benefits, particularly in the presence of albuminuria, and I should avoid combining an ACE inhibitor with an ARB or with a direct renin inhibitor due to lack of added benefit and potential harm, substituting classes if one is not tolerated [^113Fq6uf] [^113MAQye]. Hold on, I should verify race-specific guidance; in Black patients, a thiazide-type diuretic or calcium channel blocker is reasonable initial therapy, with RAAS blockade added as needed, reflecting JNC 8 recommendations and contemporary practice patterns [^111DCbKx] [^115CjvEw].

> I need to ensure I address combination therapy and resistant hypertension. Most patients with diabetes require more than one agent to reach less than 130/80 mmHg, so I should plan for combination therapy early, typically pairing a RAAS blocker with a calcium channel blocker or thiazide diuretic, and if blood pressure remains uncontrolled on three classes including a diuretic, I should consider a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist such as spironolactone or eplerenone, while avoiding dual RAAS blockade [^113MAQye] [^113csAHA]. Let me reconsider the sequence; if initial blood pressure is 150/100 mmHg or higher, starting with two agents may be appropriate to accelerate control and mitigate inertia, which aligns with endocrine guidance for high-risk presentations [^1151Dbmu].

> But wait, what about agents that both lower glucose and blood pressure. I should confirm that SGLT2 inhibitors have modest blood pressure lowering effects and reduce heart failure and kidney events, so in appropriate patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension, incorporating SGLT2 inhibitors can be synergistic for cardiorenal risk reduction while contributing to blood pressure control, though they are not substitutes for antihypertensive therapy [^112KQArv] [^116j7K8D]. I need to ensure I communicate that GLP-1 receptor agonists may also have small blood pressure benefits, but again, they should be viewed as adjuncts within comprehensive risk reduction rather than primary antihypertensives [^116gd8hs].

> Next, I should review lifestyle therapy, which is foundational for all patients. Weight loss when indicated, dietary sodium restriction with a DASH-style eating pattern, increased potassium intake, moderation of alcohol, smoking cessation, and regular aerobic and resistance exercise should be advised, and I should tailor these to comorbidities and preferences to enhance adherence and durability of blood pressure control [^112HQytv] [^116JJNEf]. Hold on, I should verify that lifestyle counseling begins even when pharmacotherapy is indicated, as guidelines emphasize concurrent implementation rather than sequential trials, especially in diabetes where cardiovascular risk is high [^1171XHPT].

> I should confirm the monitoring and titration cadence. Home blood pressure monitoring improves control, so I will educate patients and arrange validated devices, then titrate medications every 2 to 4 weeks until the target is reached, reassessing for adverse effects, orthostatic symptoms, and kidney function after RAAS initiation or dose changes, and I will aim to achieve control within 1 to 3 months when feasible because earlier control associates with better outcomes, albeit with careful attention to tolerability [^113vbMAX] [^115AnjbJ]. Let me double-check that I am not overpromising on time frames; while faster control is attractive, I must individualize pace to avoid hypotension, syncope, or acute kidney injury, particularly in older adults or those with autonomic dysfunction [^115wzjaQ].

> Finally, I need to ensure shared decision-making and documentation. I will discuss the benefits and risks of targeting less than 130/80 mmHg versus more conservative goals in older or frail patients, document the agreed target, and provide a written action plan for home monitoring, medication adherence, and when to contact the clinic, which aligns with ADA's emphasis on individualized goals and patient-centered care in diabetes and hypertension [^114tW7XP] [^112AjR8K]. Hold on, I should verify that I have addressed the key controversies; the evidence base supports less than 130/80 mmHg for most, with caution below 120 mmHg given increased adverse events in ACCORD and the exclusion of people with diabetes from SPRINT, so I will avoid pushing below 120 mmHg outside of research settings and will monitor closely if lower targets are pursued for compelling indications like prior stroke [^1152tGzz] [^1134KvG7].

Hypertension is highly prevalent in diabetes and markedly increases cardiovascular and renal risk [^111ACLPh]. The recommended blood pressure target for most adults with diabetes is **< 130/80 mmHg** if tolerated, with individualized goals for older or frail patients [^112yZ4af] [^111PRUs9]. ACE inhibitors or ARBs are **first-line** because of their cardiorenal benefits, and most patients require combination therapy to reach targets [^1151Dbmu] [^112yd3Jc]. Lifestyle measures (weight loss, sodium restriction, exercise) are essential, and home blood pressure monitoring improves control [^112HQytv]. Prompt, **timely titration** of therapy is critical to reduce cardiovascular and microvascular complications [^115AnjbJ].

---

## Epidemiology and clinical significance

Hypertension affects **~70% of patients with diabetes** [^113SAXGP], roughly twice the rate in those without diabetes, and the combination accelerates macrovascular (CAD, stroke, PAD) and microvascular (nephropathy, retinopathy) complications, increasing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity [^113YHr97].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several mechanisms link hypertension and diabetes:

- **Insulin resistance**: Increases sympathetic tone and sodium retention, raising BP.

- **Hyperglycemia**: Induces endothelial dysfunction and vascular stiffness.

- **RAAS activation**: Promotes vasoconstriction and sodium retention.

- **Autonomic dysfunction**: Common in diabetes, contributing to BP dysregulation.

---

## Recommended blood pressure targets

Current guidelines recommend a **BP target of < 130/80 mmHg** for most adults with diabetes if tolerated, with individualized adjustments:

| **Patient population** | **Recommended bp target** |
|-|-|
| General adult population with diabetes | < 130/80 mmHg (if tolerated) [^112yZ4af] [^117BUsva] |
| Older adults (≥ 65 years) | Individualized; < 140/90 mmHg if frail or complex [^111PRUs9] [^1179RtRe] |
| Pregnant patients with diabetes | 110–135/85 mmHg [^114u8JmL] |

---

## Pharmacological management

### First-line antihypertensive agents

ACE inhibitors or ARBs are **first-line** because they provide cardiorenal protection, especially in the presence of albuminuria [^113Fq6uf] [^114JoSkz].

---

### Combination therapy

Most patients require **combination therapy** to reach targets; common regimens include ACEi/ARB plus a calcium channel blocker or thiazide diuretic [^112yd3Jc]. Avoid combining ACEi and ARB or ACEi/ARB with direct renin inhibitors [^113MAQye].

---

### Additional agents

Beta-blockers are used for **CAD or arrhythmias**, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (e.g. spironolactone) for resistant hypertension, and SGLT2 inhibitors offer modest BP lowering with cardiorenal benefits [^112KQArv].

---

## Lifestyle interventions

Lifestyle modifications are **foundational** and improve BP control, enhance antihypertensive efficacy, and reduce cardiovascular risk:

- **Weight loss**: 5–10% reduction significantly lowers BP.

- **Dietary changes**: DASH or Mediterranean diets; sodium restriction; increased potassium intake [^112HQytv].

- **Physical activity**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity exercise [^notfound].

- **Alcohol moderation**: ≤ 1 drink/day (women), ≤ 2 drinks/day (men).

- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended [^112HQytv].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is essential: measure **BP at every visit or at least every 6 months** [^114JAdzV], and encourage home BP monitoring after appropriate education [^113vbMAX]. Titrate therapy every 2–4 weeks until the target is reached, then monitor every 3–6 months.

---

## Challenges and barriers

- **Therapeutic inertia**: Delays in intensifying therapy are common [^113YHr97].

- **Adherence**: Polypharmacy and side effects reduce adherence [^notfound].

- **Hypotension risk**: Especially in older adults; requires individualized targets [^1179RtRe].

---

## Clinical outcomes of optimal blood pressure control

Achieving **BP < 130/80 mmHg** reduces cardiovascular events, slows diabetic nephropathy progression, and lowers all-cause mortality [^116PuZDM] [^114Eks7z].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists provide **cardiorenal benefits** with modest BP lowering, and digital health tools (telemedicine, mobile apps) may enhance adherence and control.

---

Hypertension management in diabetes requires **tight BP control** to < 130/80 mmHg when tolerated, with ACEi/ARB first-line, combination therapy, lifestyle change, and close monitoring to reduce cardiovascular and renal complications [^112yZ4af] [^1151Dbmu].

### What should be the target blood pressure in elderly patients with diabetes? [^115dsv7w]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Hypertension is very common in elderly subjects with type 2 diabetes. The coexistence of hypertension and diabetes can be devastating to the cardiovascular system, and in these patients, tight blood pressure (BP) control is particularly beneficial. Little information is available regarding the target BP levels in elderly hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, and therefore extrapolation from data in the general population should be done. However, it is difficult to extrapolate from the general population to these frail individuals, who usually have isolated systolic hypertension, comorbidities, organ damage, cardiovascular disease, and renal failure and have a high rate of orthostatic and postprandial hypotension. On the basis of the available evidence, we provide arguments supporting the individualized approach in these patients. Target BP should be based on concomitant diseases, orthostatic BP changes, and the general condition of the patients. It is recommended to lower BP in the elderly patient with diabetes to < 140–150/90 mmHg, providing the patient is in good condition. In patients with isolated systolic hypertension, the same target is reasonable providing the diastolic BP is > 60 mmHg. In patients with coronary artery disease and in patients with orthostatic hypotension, excessive BP lowering should be avoided. In elderly hypertensive patients with diabetes, BP levels should be monitored closely in the sitting and the standing position, and the treatment should be tailored to prevent excessive fall in BP.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^115CjvEw]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### A practical approach to hypertension management in diabetes [^1144yYYm]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension is one of the most important comorbidities of diabetes, contributing significantly to death and disability and leads to macrovascular and microvascular complications. When assessing the medical priorities for patients with diabetes, treating hypertension should be a primary consideration. Practical approaches to hypertension in diabetes, including individualized targets are discussed, as per stage and complication of diabetes, according to current studies and guidelines. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are the most effective drugs for treating hypertension in diabetes, in the absence of contraindications. Calcium antagonists or diuretics are acceptable as second-line agents. Once the target is achieved, antihypertensive drugs should be continued. Newer antidiabetes medications such as sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA), and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) have antihypertensive properties and may assist in treatment decision-making.

Epidemiology

Hypertension is twice as common in patients with diabetes than in patients without diabetes. Hypertension (defined as at least 140/90 mmHg or on therapy for hypertension) in an overweight or obese asymptomatic person is also one of the criteria to test for diabetes or prediabetes, and is thus, an important risk factor for diabetes. Individuals aged 55 years or older have a 90% chance of developing hypertension, and approximately 70% of patients with diabetes over the age of 40 years also have hypertension. Eight out of ten diabetes patients are affected by CV-related issues, leading to death. Hence, treating hypertension in diabetes should be a primary consideration when assessing the medical priorities of patients with diabetes.

### How early should blood pressure control be achieved for optimal cardiovascular outcomes? [^115AnjbJ]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

As a consequence of the aging population and the increasing prevalence rates for conditions such as type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD), management of hypertension will be focusing more and more on the high-risk patient. Clinical practice guidelines for managing hypertension in the United States recommend a target blood pressure (BP) < 130/80mmHg in patients with diabetes or CKD, notably lower than the 140/90-mmHg threshold for the general hypertensive population. However, the optimal timeframe from initiation of antihypertensive therapy to attaining these levels of BP control and influencing cardiovascular outcomes is not as well defined. Overall, a series of landmark BP intervention trials in patients with hypertension and additional cardiovascular risk factors collectively support that achieving prompt BP control, ideally within 1–3 months, translates into improved cardiovascular outcomes. Although the consistency of the findings is encouraging, the strength of this conclusion is limited by the available data, which were derived from studies not designed to determine the definition or benefits of early BP reduction. In several of these studies, using a treatment approach with initial monotherapy or combination therapy has clearly demonstrated pronounced BP lowering and high BP control rates within an intensive timeframe of 3–6 months of therapy. Although these studies were not conducted exclusively in high-risk patients, subgroup analyses have demonstrated that the observed outcomes in the overall study populations apply to the diabetic and CKD subsets.

### Management of hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: guidelines based on current evidence [^113vhMMh]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Hypertension and diabetes are becoming increasingly common. Most patients with both disorders have a markedly worsened risk for premature microvascular and macrovascular complications. The appropriate management of the hypertension seen in almost 70% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus remains controversial. However, over the past few years, many randomized, controlled trials have provided guidance for more effective therapy. These trials have established the need for a lower goal blood pressure (< 130/80 mm Hg) than has previously been recommended. In addition, they have proven the efficacy of drugs from three major classes of antihypertensive agents; however, comparative trials have failed to show definite superiority of any particular class in either lowering blood pressure or reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. To achieve therapy goals, multiple antihypertensive drugs are usually needed. On the basis of their apparent superiority in slowing diabetic nephropathy, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should probably be the first choice. Second and third choices should be a long-acting diuretic and a calcium-channel blocker or a beta-blocker, respectively. Attention should also be directed toward nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic control of hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1171XHPT]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension in diabetes — initiation thresholds and targets (Recommendations 10.7–10.8): In individuals with confirmed office-based blood pressure ≥ 130/80 mmHg, pharmacologic therapy should be initiated and titrated to achieve the recommended blood pressure goal of < 130/80 mmHg, and individuals with confirmed office-based blood pressure ≥ 150/90 mmHg should, in addition to lifestyle therapy, have prompt initiation and timely titration of two drugs or a single-pill combination of drugs demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular events in people with diabetes.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes [^111PRUs9]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to management of hypertension, BP targets, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to individualize treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus. Set the BP goal of SBP to 130 mmHg and < 130 mmHg if tolerated, but not < 120 mmHg. Target SBP to 130–139 mmHg in older patients (age > 65 years).

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, pharmacotherapy, ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to use the same drug treatment strategies in patients with T2DM as for patients without diabetes but lower BP to < 130/80 mmHg as the primary goal.
Use combination strategies in most patients as BP control is difficult in diabetes.

### Guideline-driven management of hypertension: an evidence-based update [^114ugJqL]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Several important findings bearing on the prevention, detection, and management of hypertension have been reported since publication of the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Blood Pressure Guideline. This review summarizes and places in context the results of relevant observational studies, randomized clinical trials, and meta-analyses published between January 2018 and March 2021. Topics covered include blood pressure measurement, patient evaluation for secondary hypertension, cardiovascular disease risk assessment and blood pressure threshold for drug therapy, lifestyle and pharmacological management, treatment target blood pressure goal, management of hypertension in older adults, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, resistant hypertension, and optimization of care using patient, provider, and health system approaches. Presenting new information in each of these areas has the potential to increase hypertension awareness, treatment, and control which remain essential for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality in the future.

### Prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: synopsis of the 2017 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association hypertension guideline [^116VRena]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Description

In November 2017, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) released a clinical practice guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure (BP) in adults. This article summarizes the major recommendations.

Methods

In 2014, the ACC and the AHA appointed a multidisciplinary committee to update previous reports of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. The committee reviewed literature and commissioned systematic reviews and meta-analyses on out-of-office BP monitoring, the optimal target for BP lowering, the comparative benefits and harms of different classes of antihypertensive agents, and the comparative benefits and harms of initiating therapy with a single antihypertensive agent or a combination of 2 agents.

Recommendations

This article summarizes key recommendations in the following areas: BP classification, BP measurement, screening for secondary hypertension, nonpharmacologic therapy, BP thresholds and cardiac risk estimation to guide drug treatment, treatment goals (general and for patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and advanced age), choice of initial drug therapy, resistant hypertension, and strategies to improve hypertension control.

### Management of blood pressure in patients with diabetes [^113S3r7F]. American Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes. Lowering blood pressure (BP) to 135/85 mm Hg is the main goal of treatment. A nonpharmcologic approach is recommended in all patients. If BP levels remain above the target despite nonpharmacologic treatment, drug therapy should be initiated. Blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) represent the cornerstone of the antihypertensive drug arsenal; however, in most patients, combination therapy is required. For many patients, a combination of RAAS blocker and calcium antagonist is the combination preferred by the treating physician. Often three or even four drugs are needed. Treatment should be individualized according to concomitant risk factors and diseases and depending on the age and hemodynamic and laboratory parameters of the patient. In order to maximally reduce cardio renal risk, control of lipid and glycemic levels should also be ensured.

### Achievement of recommended glucose and blood pressure targets in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension in clinical practice-study rationale and protocol of DIALOGUE [^111iGgAf]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Guideline compliance in daily clinical practice

Treatment recommendations by current guidelines are mainly based on evidence from randomised controlled trials. However, these trials reflect only selected patient populations defined by detailed in- and exclusion criteria of these trials. Patients in daily practice are usually older and suffer from more co-morbidities as compared to those in clinical trials. Available data suggest suboptimal treatment target achievement with respect to glucose, blood pressure and lipid control. While there are quite some data on patient characteristics, current treatments and outcome of diabetics with hypertension in clinical practice, there are much less especially with respect to the use of newly developed and approved anti-hypertensive and anti-diabetic compounds and physicians approach towards its management. Additionally, it is quite unclear if and how the different combinations of anti-diabetic and anti-hypertensive medications contribute to the achievement and preservation of target blood glucose and blood pressure values in individual patients.

Aim

The purpose of the registry is to evaluate various therapy regimes of anti-diabetic (including incretin-based and exclusively non-incretin-based therapies) and anti-hypertensive treatments (including RAAS-inhibitors and exclusively non-RAAS-inhibitors) as well as their combinations, patient reported outcomes and treatment success in hypertensive T2D patients. It is the first prospective registry to determine treatment success based on the new individualized treatment targets of the ADA and the EASD.

### The goal of blood pressure in the hypertensive patient with diabetes is defined: now the challenge is go from recommendations to practice [^111N7adM]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

High blood pressure BP is the leading cause of CVD and deaths globally. It is associated with 7.5 million deaths (which represents one-eighth of all deaths) per year worldwide. The importance of BP as a modifiable risk factor for CVD is well recognized and many effective and inexpensive BP-lowering treatments are commonly available. Therefore, BP control and prevention of related morbidity and mortality could be clearly achievable. However, the awareness, treatment and control of hypertension are low in all countries, despite hypertension being an easily detectable, common and well established risk factor for CVD. The reasons for a persisting huge gap in awareness and treatment of hypertension, despite the identification and control of blood pressure being prioritized by many national and global organizations and despite the availability of cheap and effective medications are unclear. Use of combination therapies, which is needed to control hypertension, is relatively uncommon even in wealthier countries. Although once hypertension is detected, 80% of individuals are on a pharmacologic therapy only a minority is controlled. This suggests the need for a more aggressive approach to BP control (e.g. by using combination therapies). A recent study using a meticulously algorithm applied to DM2 patients was able to lower BP, however more than half of the patients did not achieve the ADA/Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure: The Seventh Report (JNC 7) targets demonstrating the complexity of BP control in this population.

Blood pressure goals in diabetes — people with diabetes who have hypertension should be treated to blood pressure goals of < 130/80 mmHg. In type 1 diabetes, a similar blood pressure goal of < 130/80 mmHg is recommended, and individualized treatment goals may be < 120/80 mmHg, but this is less supported by the evidence and may increase adverse events.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to management of hypertension, BP targets, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider targeting a BP of 110–135/85 mmHg in pregnant patients with diabetes and chronic hypertension in the interest of reducing the risk for accelerated maternal hypertension.
Titrate therapy from a BP threshold of 140/90 mmHg for better pregnancy outcomes with no increase in the risk of small-for-gestational-age birth weight.

### How important is optimal blood pressure control? [^116bJp19]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence for the cardiovascular benefits of antihypertensive treatment is among the strongest in medicine. Randomized, prospective, unconfounded studies in thousands of people have shown that even small reductions in blood pressure for short periods substantially improve cardiovascular outcomes. Recent evidence has emphasized the importance of optimal blood pressure control, particularly in patients with high cardiovascular risk, such as those with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Objective

This article discusses optimal target blood pressure goals, reviews the effects of antihypertensive treatment in high-risk patients, presents current guidelines for blood pressure control, discusses the failure worldwide to achieve such control, and suggests approaches to improved treatment.

Conclusions

In high-risk patients, small improvements in blood pressure control are associated with large reductions in cardiovascular risk. National and international guidelines for the management of hypertension therefore now recommend rigorous blood pressure targets. Despite extensive clinical evidence, the delivery of care for hypertension remains unsatisfactory. Hypertension is underdiagnosed and undertreated, and recommended target blood pressures are rarely achieved. Physicians appear reluctant to make changes to treatment, which would lead to more effective use of antihypertensive drugs. Overwhelming evidence supports the benefit of optimal blood pressure control in patients with hypertension. Several studies have shown that such control can be achieved, but most likely requires combination treatment. Combination treatment is likely to be successful only if drugs are well tolerated and patients are compliant. The angiotensin II receptor antagonists (sartans) have the therapeutic advantage of efficacy, excellent tolerability, and a good record of compliance. Blood pressure control can be more easily accomplished by using sartans early in treatment and by recognizing the benefits of even small reductions in blood pressure.

### Beyond hypertension toward guidelines for cardiovascular risk reduction [^117XFJrf]. American Journal of Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Most current clinical guidelines focus primarily on the management of individual cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure (BP), hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes. A more appropriate clinical approach to reducing cardiovascular disease risk would be based on a comprehensive evaluation of risk profile, and accurate stratification of global (absolute) risk in individual patients. We propose that global risk should be used as the main determinant of whom to treat, how to treat, and how much to treat.

Methods

In this article we use a series of case studies to demonstrate the implications of replacing the traditional "single risk factor-based" approach to managing hypertension by one based on global risk assessment. In some situations patients with mildly elevated BP levels would not be recommended for antihypertensive drug treatment whereas others with lower BP would be treated, depending upon the entire risk profile.

Conclusion

We propose to replace the single risk factor-based approach with the assessment of global cardiovascular risk, both in the clinical management of individual patients and in guidelines.

### Diabetes: treating hypertension [^1154yvoe]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Between 2007 and 2010, the age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension in US adults with diabetes was 59%, more than double the prevalence in those without diabetes. Major cardiac events occur in approximately 5% of people with diabetes and untreated hypertension each year, and the risk is higher in those with other risk factors, such as diabetic nephropathy.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of different blood pressure targets in people with diabetes and hypertension? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 10 studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following intervention: more intensive (lower) blood pressure targets versus less intensive (higher) targets in people with diabetes and hypertension.

### A practical approach to hypertension management in diabetes [^116suwjB]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is one of the most important comorbidities of diabetes, contributing significantly to death and disability. It is responsible for macrovascular (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, stroke) and microvascular (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy) complications. Although we have an array of antihypertensive drugs, recently newer blood pressure-lowering drugs and antidiabetic drugs with antihypertensive properties have become available. Several trials have shown the significance of managing hypertension in diabetes; thus, treating hypertension is an important part of cardiovascular (CV) risk reduction. This article aims to present a practical approach to hypertension in diabetes. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not involve any new studies of human or animal subjects performed by the author.

The frequent concurrence of elevated blood pressure (BP) and type 2 diabetes markedly elevates the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. In this review, we discuss the evidence supporting the role of BP-lowering therapies in preventing cardiovascular events in people with type 2 diabetes and the most appropriate BP treatment target in these individuals. We outline possible reasons for the heterogeneous effect of BP lowering in patients with and without diabetes and consider several pathophysiological mechanisms that could potentially explain such differences. The review introduces a mediation model, delineating the intricate interplay between hypertension and diabetes and their joint contribution to cardiovascular and renal pathologies. Finally, we outline the role of lifestyle changes and other pharmacological options in attenuating cardiometabolic risks in patients with type 2 diabetes. We propose a comprehensive, patient-centred management strategy, integrating various antihypertensive therapeutic approaches and providing clinicians with a systematic framework for better decision-making.

### The goal of blood pressure in the hypertensive patient with diabetes is defined: now the challenge is go from recommendations to practice [^113YHr97]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

The recent Latin American and European guidelines published this year has proposed as a goal for blood pressure control in patients with diabetes type 2 a value similar or inferior to 140/90 mmHg. High blood pressure is the leading cause of cardiovascular diseases and deaths globally. Although once hypertension is detected, 80% of individuals are on a pharmacologic therapy only a minority is controlled. Diabetes also is a risk factor for other serious chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease. Whether specifically targeting lower fasting glucose levels can reduce cardiovascular outcomes remains unknown. Hypertension is present in 20% to 60% of patients with type 2 diabetes, depending on age, ethnicity, obesity, and the presence of micro or macro albuminuria. High blood pressure substantially increases the risk of both macro and micro vascular complications, doubling the risk of all-cause mortality and stroke, tripling the risk of coronary heart disease and significantly hastening the progression of diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Thus, blood pressure lowering is a major priority in preventing cardiovascular and renal events in patients with diabetes and hypertension. During many years the BP goals recommended in patients with diabetes were more aggressive than in patients without diabetes. As reviewed in this article many clinical trials have demonstrated not only the lack of benefits of lowering the BP below 130/80 mmHg, but also the J-shaped relationship in DM patients. Overall we discuss the importance of define the group of patients in whom significant BP reduction could be particularly dangerous and, on the other hand, those with a high risk of stroke who could benefit most from an intensive hypotensive therapy. In any case, the big challenge now is avoid the therapeutic inertia (leaving diabetic patients with BP values of 140/90 mmHg or higher) at all costs, as this would lead to an unacceptable toll in terms of human lives, suffering, and socioeconomic costs.

### Hypertension management in type 2 diabetes mellitus: recommendations of the Joint National Committee VII [^111KdNmY]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

HTN in patients who have diabetes should be managed aggressively; the goal BP of less than 130/80 mm Hg should be attained if clinicians seek to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for these patients. Along with instituting medical therapy after HTN is detected, lifestyle modifications need to be managed aggressively, together with strict glycemic and lipid control. Early management and optimization of treatment of HTN can delay and possibly prevent progression of cardiovascular complications, such as CAD, CKD, peripheral vascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease. Studied approaches to treat HTN in diabetics have included ACEIs and ARBs. Either class of medication, generally in combination with a thiazide diuretic, should be considered as initial therapy. Calcium antagonists, BBs, and alpha-antagonists also have a role in this population of patients, usually as third- and fourth-line add-ons. The importance of using agents that block RAAS is becoming understood better. Typically, three or more antihypertensive medications plus lifestyle interventions are required to achieve a goal BP of less than 130/80 mm Hg. Managing patients who have diabetes and HTN is a dynamic, ever-changing challenge. Early and aggressive antihypertensive therapy pays off; it is hoped that the insights in this article enable clinicians to meet the challenge more successfully.

### Blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with diabetes mellitus [^1134KvG7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

When treating elevated blood pressure (BP), doctors often want to know what blood pressure target they should try to achieve. The standard blood pressure target in clinical practice for some time has been less than 140–160/90–100 mmHg for the general population of people with elevated blood pressure. Several clinical guidelines published in recent years have recommended lower targets (less than 130/80 mmHg) for people with diabetes mellitus. It is not known whether attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard target reduces mortality and morbidity in those with elevated blood pressure and diabetes.

Objectives

To determine if 'lower' BP targets (any target less than 130/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with 'standard' BP targets (less than 140–160/90–100 mmHg) in people with diabetes.

Search Methods

We searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for related reviews. We conducted electronic searches of the Hypertension Group Specialised Register (January 1946 - October 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE (January 1946 - October 2013), EMBASE (January 1974 - October 2013) and ClinicalTrials.gov. The most recent search was performed on October 4, 2013. Other search sources were the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), and reference lists of all papers and relevant reviews.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing people with diabetes randomized to lower or to standard BP targets as previously defined, and providing data on any of the primary outcomes below.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed and established the included trials and data entry. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure and end-stage renal disease. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean systolic and diastolic BP, and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Main Results

We found five randomized trials, recruiting a total of 7314 participants and with a mean follow-up of 4.5 years. Only one trial (ACCORD) compared outcomes associated with 'lower' (< 120 mmHg) or 'standard' (< 140 mmHg) systolic blood pressure targets in 4734 participants. Despite achieving a significantly lower BP (119.3/64.4 mmHg vs 133.5/70.5 mmHg, P < 0.0001), and using more antihypertensive medications, the only significant benefit in the group assigned to 'lower' systolic blood pressure (SBP) was a reduction in the incidence of stroke: risk ratio (RR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.88, P = 0.009, absolute risk reduction 1.1%. The effect of SBP targets on mortality was compatible with both a reduction and increase in risk: RR 1.05 CI 0.84 to 1.30, low quality evidence. Trying to achieve the 'lower' SBP target was associated with a significant increase in the number of other serious adverse events: RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.91, P < 0.00001, absolute risk increase 2.0%. Four trials (ABCD-H, ABCD-N, ABCD-2V, and a subgroup of HOT) specifically compared clinical outcomes associated with 'lower' versus 'standard' targets for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in people with diabetes. The total number of participants included in the DBP target analysis was 2580. Participants assigned to 'lower' DBP had a significantly lower achieved BP: 128/76 mmHg vs 135/83 mmHg, P < 0.0001. There was a trend towards reduction in total mortality in the group assigned to the 'lower' DBP target (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.01), mainly due to a trend to lower non-cardiovascular mortality. There was no difference in stroke (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.05), in myocardial infarction (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.40) or in congestive heart failure (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.92), low quality evidence. End-stage renal failure and total serious adverse events were not reported in any of the trials. A sensitivity analysis of trials comparing DBP targets < 80 mmHg (as suggested in clinical guidelines) versus < 90 mmHg showed similar results. There was a high risk of selection bias for every outcome analyzed in favor of the 'lower' target in the trials included for the analysis of DBP targets.

Authors' Conclusions

At the present time, evidence from randomized trials does not support blood pressure targets lower than the standard targets in people with elevated blood pressure and diabetes. More randomized controlled trials are needed, with future trials reporting total mortality, total serious adverse events as well as cardiovascular and renal events.

Hypertension management in diabetes — the recommended blood pressure goal for most persons with T1D, T2D, or prediabetes is < 130/80 mm Hg. Therapeutic lifestyle interventions in persons with hypertension are recommended to include consultation with a registered dietitian for education about an overall healthy diet (such as the Mediterranean diet), weight management, reduced sodium intake (such as the DASH diet), daily physical activity and regular exercise (several times a week), and as-needed consultation with a psychologist or certified diabetes care and education specialist (CDCES) to support long-term behavior change. If BP goals are unattained with therapeutic lifestyle changes, use antihypertensive pharmacotherapy to achieve individual BP treatment goals. Select antihypertensive agents based on their ability to reduce BP to goal and prevent or slow the progression of micro- and macrovascular disease, and use either an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) for BP control and to delay the progression of DKD or CKD in DM. Intensify pharmacotherapy as needed to achieve BP goals; combinations may include either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB plus diuretics, calcium channel antagonists, combined alpha-beta blockers, and newer-generation beta blockers, and consider a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist for resistant hypertension.

### Achievement of recommended glucose and blood pressure targets in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension in clinical practice-study rationale and protocol of DIALOGUE [^116bb15q]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with type 2 diabetes have 2–4 times greater risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than those without, and this is even further aggravated if they also suffer from hypertension. Unfortunately, less than one third of hypertensive diabetic patients meet blood pressure targets, and more than half fail to achieve target HbA1c values. Thus, appropriate blood pressure and glucose control are of utmost importance. Since treatment sometimes fails in clinical practice while clinical trials generally suggest good efficacy, data from daily clinical practice, especially with regard to the use of newly developed anti-diabetic and anti-hypertensive compounds in unselected patient populations, are essential. The DIALOGUE registry aims to close this important gap by evaluating different treatment approaches in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients with respect to their effectiveness and tolerability and their impact on outcomes. In addition, DIALOGUE is the first registry to determine treatment success based on the new individualized treatment targets recommended by the ADA and the EASD.

Methods

DIALOGUE is a prospective observational German multicentre registry and will enrol 10,000 patients with both diabetes and hypertension in up to 700 sites. After a baseline visit, further documentations are scheduled at 6, 12 and 24 months. There are two co-primary objectives referring to the most recent guidelines for the treatment of diabetes and hypertension: 1) individual HbA1c goal achievement with respect to anti-diabetic pharmacotherapy and 2) individual blood pressure goal achievement with different antihypertensive treatments. Among the secondary objectives the rate of major cardio-vascular and cerebro-vascular events (MACCE) and the rate of hospitalizations are the most important.

Conclusion

The registry will be able to gain insights into the reasons for the obvious gap between the demonstrated efficacy and safety of anti-diabetic and anti-hypertensive drugs in clinical trials and their real world balance of effectiveness and safety.

### Diabetes and hypertension: clinical update [^116gd8hs]. American Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

The presence of hypertension in individuals with type 2 diabetes augments the risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In this regard, data support that management of hypertension in this high-risk population is a critical risk reduction strategy. In recent years, a number of work groups have redefined hypertension, management strategies, and targets. In this context, there is still considerable discussion on an appropriate target for blood pressure in the diabetic population. However, despite this discussion on target blood pressure, it is widely recognized that there is considerable residual risk for heightened cardiovascular events in the hypertensive, diabetic population despite widespread awareness and treatment. There has been increasing interest in management strategies for blood pressure reduction in this high-risk population that complement traditional antihypertensive agents. Large-scale clinical trials have shown that hypoglycemic agents can complement blood pressure reduction and have a favorable effect on cardiovascular outcomes such as the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. In the diabetic population, consideration should be given to the blood pressure lowering effects of the newer hypoglycemic agents when working toward additional glycemic control in patients with hypertension.

Description

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) annually updates its Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes to provide clinicians, patients, researchers, payers, and other interested parties with evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with diabetes.

Methods

For the 2018 standards, the ADA Professional Practice Committee searched MEDLINE through November 2017 to add, clarify, or revise recommendations on the basis of new evidence. The committee rated the recommendations as A, B, or C depending on the quality of evidence or E for expert consensus or clinical experience. The standards were reviewed and approved by the Executive Committee of the ADA Board of Directors, which includes health care professionals, scientists, and laypersons. Feedback from the larger clinical community informed revisions.

Recommendations

This synopsis focuses on guidance relating to cardiovascular disease and risk management in nonpregnant adults with diabetes. Recommendations address diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension and dyslipidemia), aspirin use, screening for and treatment of coronary heart disease, and lifestyle interventions.

Other Limitations

There are several limitations to consider in the JNC 8 committee's approach to BP treatment (Table 2). Unlike the other professional societies' guidelines, the JNC 8 panel did not address topics outside of their chosen critical questions, specifically given the paucity of randomized trial evidence addressing such questions. While they endorsed the AHA/ACC Guideline on Lifestyle Management to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk, 50 the JNC 8 does not address lifestyle modifications or a timeline for attempting them. Another limitation is that ambulatory BP monitoring, including cut‐off values for diagnosing hypertension based on home BP readings, is not addressed.

Table 2
Recommendations for the AHA/ACC Committee

One suggestion is to confirm elevated BP with ambulatory BP monitoring, such as that recently recommended by the US Preventive Service Task Force. 51 There is in general a lack of guidance on the diagnosis of hypertension and the evaluation for secondary causes. Although the JNC 8 committee offers a titration schedule for treating hypertension, the recommendations are somewhat vague, and there is no guidance for resistant hypertension beyond referral to a hypertension specialist.

We also recommend that the AHA/ACC guideline committee focus on the benefits of the various drug classes and the situations that call for monodrug versus multidrug therapy. Another important area of focus will be the benefit of more‐intensive BP treatment, especially in the elderly and those with diabetes, and the addition of a risk‐based approach to initiating treatment (described earlier). These are all areas that can be targeted by the new AHA/ACC guideline committee.

### Achievement of recommended glucose and blood pressure targets in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension in clinical practice-study rationale and protocol of DIALOGUE [^112BGdz9]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

There is an increasing prevalence of type-2 diabetes, which is attributable to a growing population, an increase in life expectancy, increased diagnostic efforts, and a reduced diabetes attributable risk due to recent advances in diabetes treatment. Hypertension is the most frequent (90%) among the co-morbid disease conditions and further increases the risk for disease and treatment related complications. The combination of both hypertension and diabetes accelerates the progression of diabetes related complications such as diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, and diastolic heart failure and doubles the risk of stroke, CV and all-cause mortality as compared to non-diabetic patients with hypertension. Risk prediction in this population is however not easy making the adaption of available risk prediction tools necessary, partly because risks have gone down in recent years.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^1151Dbmu]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

AACE 2023 type 2 diabetes hypertension targets and treatment recommend that AACE has set a specific BP goal for the majority of adults with T2D as < 130 mm Hg with a diastolic BP goal of < 80 mm Hg, with a lower target considered for persons with micro- or macroalbuminuria, moderate/high risk for or with established ASCVD, peripheral vascular disease, or retinopathy, and recognition that some persons with T2D may not tolerate a goal of < 130/80 mm Hg. Lifestyle therapy is part of initial management, as exercise several times per week is important because there are reductions in both systolic and diastolic BP with endurance and dynamic resistance training, and Mediterranean diets have been demonstrated to lower BP. Pharmacologic therapy specifies that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are considered first-line therapies for HTN in persons with T2D, particularly in those with DKD; there is no additional benefit for coadministration of an ACEI and an ARB together, and combination may cause harm, an ARB can substitute for ACEI intolerance, and if the initial BP is > 150/100 mm Hg, dual therapy may need to be used at the outset.

### The hypertension in diabetes study (HDS): a catalyst for change [^115tggi6]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Hypertension is now established as a major risk factor for premature cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in people with Type 2 diabetes and all modern treatment guidelines recommend the routine treatment of hypertension in these patients. However, these developments have been relatively recent. Only a decade ago, outside of small studies in patients with nephropathy, there was little evidence with regard to the efficacy and safety of treating elevated blood pressure in people with Type 2 diabetes. Consequently, for many patients, elevated blood pressure remained undetected and untreated. This changed with the publication of the Hypertension in Diabetes Study (HDS) in 1998. This study revealed that hypertension was very common in people with Type 2 diabetes and demonstrated the dramatic benefits of blood pressure lowering in reducing their risk of major macrovascular and microvascular complications. The unequivocal evidence from this study provided a much-needed catalyst for change, propelling blood pressure measurement and its treatment to the forefront of risk management in these patients. Many studies have followed and many questions remain with regard to the preferred anti-hypertensive treatment strategy and optimal treatment targets for blood pressure. In the meantime, many millions of patients with Type 2 diabetes worldwide have benefited and will continue to benefit from the therapeutic insights gained from the treatment of blood pressure in the 1148 patients enrolled in the Hypertension in Diabetes Study in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study.

### The optimal blood pressure target in diabetes mellitus: a quest coming to an end? [^1112xULC]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

The presence of hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) substantially increases cardiovascular risk. Blood pressure (BP) decrease in these individuals is associated with large reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but the optimal BP levels in DM still remain a matter of important controversy. For almost 20 years, guidelines recommended an office BP target of < 130/80mmHg in diabetic individuals, following evidence from trials randomizing patients to diastolic BP levels. When the action-to-control-cardiovascular-risk-in-diabetes-blood-pressure (ACCORD-BP) study showed that systolic BP (SBP) < 120mmHg was associated with similar risk to SBP < 140mmHg in type 2 DM, all guidelines stepped back to recommend a SBP < 140mmHg, despite the obvious limitations of ACCORD-BP, including the surprisingly low event rate and the actual average BP of 133.5/70.5mmHg in the "standard-target" arm. In contrast, the systolic-blood-pressure-intervention-trial (SPRINT) showed cardiovascular benefits in hypertensive patients without DM randomized to SBP < 120 versus < 140mmHg and many believed that absence of between-group differences in ACCORD-BP was rather a matter of power and not of dissimilar cardiovascular profile of diabetic patients. In this regard, the American-College-of-Cardiology/American-Heart-Association 2017 BP guidelines advocated a BP target of < 130/80 in all hypertensives, including those with DM. However, the 2018 American-Diabetes-Association recommendations were not in the same direction, suggesting BP goal < 140/90 for most patients, with the exception of those with "high cardiovascular risk", where a < 130/80mmHg target may apply. This review presents the evidence from old and recent trials relevant to optimal BP levels in DM, aiming to shed light in this major clinical question.

### Management of hypertension in patients with diabetes: the place of angiotensin-II receptor blockers [^115jhxCT]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Hypertension is an important cardiovascular (CV) risk factor in patients with diabetes mellitus. In this setting, tight control of blood pressure (BP) significantly reduces CV morbidity and mortality. In the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) was superior to a 0.7% decrease in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as far as reducing morbidity and mortality was concerned. In the Hypertension Optimal Treatment study, the risk of CV events decreased by 51% among patients with type 2 diabetes randomized to the lower BP level. Based on these findings, contemporary treatment guidelines recommend a target SBP/diastolic blood pressure of < 130/80 mmHg for patients with diabetes.

Recommendations 4.2–4.5 — hypertension management in diabetes: Therapeutic lifestyle interventions in persons with hypertension are recommended to include consultation with a registered dietitian, an overall healthy diet (such as the Mediterranean diet), weight management, reduced sodium intake (such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH] diet), daily physical activity and regular exercise, and as-needed consultation with a psychologist or certified diabetes care and education specialist (CDCES) to support long-term behavior change (Grade A; BEL 1). If BP goals cannot be met with only therapeutic lifestyle interventions, pharmacotherapy should be started to help persons with diabetes meet their BP goals (Grade A; BEL 1). Select antihypertensive agents based on their ability to reduce BP to goal and prevent or slow the progression of micro- and macrovascular disease, and use either an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) for BP control and to delay the progression of DKD or CKD in DM (Grade A; BEL 1). Intensify pharmacotherapy as needed to achieve BP goals; combinations may include an ACE inhibitor or an ARB plus diuretics, calcium channel antagonists, combined alpha-beta blockers, or newer-generation beta blockers, and consider a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist for resistant hypertension (Grade A; BEL 1).

Introduction

Among people with diabetes, about 40% of those aged 45 years, and more than 60% of those aged 75 years or over, will have a blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg. Major cardiac events occur in approximately 5% of people with diabetes and untreated hypertension each year, and the risk is higher in those with other risk factors, such as diabetic nephropathy.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of antihypertensives in people with diabetes and hypertension? What are the effects of different blood pressure targets in people with diabetes and hypertension? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 24 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: alpha-blockers, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, blood pressure targets (lower or higher), calcium-channel blockers, and diuretics.

Systolic blood pressure target less than 130 mm Hg — evidence gap and ongoing trials: Additional RCTs would be needed to definitively recommend an SBP target of less than 130 mm Hg. Given the results of SPRINT, such a large clinical trial is unlikely to be performed in the U.S. in a general (lower risk) hypertensive population. In hypertension patients with diabetes, additional data from RCTs may be available in the next few years as two large trials, Blood Pressure Control Target in Diabetes (BPROAD) and Intervention for High-normal or Borderline-elevated Blood Pressure in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes (IPAD) are currently enrolling in China, and these trials should provide further evidence for the benefit of specific SBP thresholds and goals in patients with diabetes.
