## Question

What percentage of the total 24 hour extended release opiod should be used as the oral immediate release opioid dose for breakthrough pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what percentage of the total 24-hour extended-release opioid dose should be used as the oral immediate-release opioid dose for breakthrough pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-credibility guideline sources that directly address breakthrough dosing. Then, I should verify whether major guidelines converge on the same percentage range. Next, I will check for any exceptions or alternative rules of thumb and reconcile them. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable answer with caveats for special populations and titration principles.

> Let me first confirm the most authoritative guidance. The ASCO guideline explicitly recommends prescribing immediate-release opioids for breakthrough pain at approximately 5% to 20% of the total daily morphine equivalent dose, with a typical target around 10%, and it notes that the strength of evidence for the specific percentage is weak even though the recommendation to provide breakthrough medication is strong [^979f6518] [^f0ac8512] [^a91242fe].

> Wait, let me verify whether other high-credibility guidelines align with this range. The MASCC-ASCO-AAHPM-HPNA-NICSO guideline similarly recommends initiating immediate-release opioids at 5% to 20% of the daily regular morphine equivalent dose for breakthrough pain, reinforcing the same percentage framework across multidisciplinary oncology and palliative care sources [^406e6a3f].

> I should also confirm whether regulatory labeling echoes this practice. FDA labeling for several extended-release opioids instructs clinicians to provide rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate-release analgesic when breakthrough pain occurs, and to titrate the ER dose based on rescue use, which operationally supports using a small proportion of the total daily dose as IR rescue, consistent with the 5% to 20% convention [^c4cb07f2] [^776b0a67] [^1b8c3f6a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check for alternative rules of thumb. Some older or specialty sources describe a one-sixth rule, roughly 16.7%, which falls within the 5% to 20% band, and a few studies and reviews have explored fixed proportions such as one-eighth to one-sixth of the daily dose, again overlapping with the 5% to 20% range rather than contradicting it [^4267106e] [^18dea2e6] [^9daf823d].

> Let me consider the clinical rationale to ensure internal consistency. Using a modest fraction of the total daily dose helps balance analgesia with safety, accounting for incomplete cross-tolerance and interpatient variability. This is why guidelines and labels consistently advise starting conservatively and titrating to effect, which fits the 5% to 20% paradigm and the practice of reassessing rescue frequency to guide ER dose adjustments [^979f6518] [^1b8c3f6a].

> I should double-check special populations and exceptions. In pediatrics, many centers use a 10% of total daily dose rule for breakthrough dosing, which sits squarely within the adult 5% to 20% range, and for transdermal fentanyl, rescue dosing is commonly framed as 10% to 15% of the total daily opioid dose during initiation, again consistent with the same principle of a small, proportional rescue dose [^25b22051] [^c9b626b1] [^1778b56d].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the final synthesis is precise. The standard, guideline-supported breakthrough dose is 5% to 20% of the total 24-hour extended-release opioid dose, with 10% as a pragmatic starting point, titrated to clinical response and used to inform adjustments of the around-the-clock regimen if rescue is needed frequently [^979f6518] [^f0ac8512] [^406e6a3f].

---

The standard breakthrough dose is **5–20% of the total daily extended-release opioid dose** [^979f6518], with 10% as a typical starting point [^f0ac8512]. This range is supported by major guidelines and is commonly used in clinical practice [^52646265]. Doses should be **individualized and titrated** based on response and adverse effects, and if more than 2–4 breakthrough doses are needed per day, the baseline extended-release dose should be increased [^2ca48451].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Several authoritative guidelines provide clear recommendations on the appropriate percentage of the total daily extended-release opioid dose to use for breakthrough pain:

- **ASCO guidelines**: Recommend immediate-release opioids at 5–20% of the total daily morphine equivalent dose (MED) for breakthrough pain, with 10% as a typical starting point [^979f6518] [^52646265].

- **MASCC-ASCO-AAHPM-HPNA-NICSO guideline**: Similarly recommends 5–20% of the daily MED for breakthrough pain [^406e6a3f].

- **WHO guidelines**: Emphasize the use of immediate-release opioids as rescue medication, though they do not specify a precise percentage, aligning with the 5–20% range used in practice [^4f60b64d].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the 5–20% range

Clinical studies and expert consensus support the **5–20% range** as effective and safe for most patients:

- **Prospective study**: Found that 89% of patients with advanced cancer responded to oral immediate-release opioids at a median dose of 10% of the total daily MED, supporting 10% as a typical starting dose [^18d76899].

- **Randomized trial**: Showed no significant difference in efficacy or side effects between 1/6, 1/8, and 1/12 of the total daily dose, suggesting that lower percentages (e.g. 8–12%) can still be effective [^9daf823d].

- **Clinical practice**: The 5–20% range balances analgesia with safety, minimizing the risk of overdose and adverse effects [^979f6518].

---

## Factors influencing breakthrough dose selection

While the 5–20% range provides a general guideline, **individual patient factors** must be considered:

- **Opioid tolerance**: Higher tolerance may require doses toward the upper end of the range (15–20%) [^notfound].

- **Age and comorbidities**: Elderly or medically fragile patients may require lower doses (5–10%) to avoid adverse effects [^notfound].

- **Pain characteristics**: Rapid-onset or severe breakthrough pain may necessitate doses at the higher end of the range or alternative formulations (e.g. transmucosal fentanyl) [^e159611f].

- **Renal or hepatic impairment**: Dose adjustments may be necessary due to altered opioid metabolism [^8e76590a].

---

## Clinical scenarios and examples

| **Clinical scenario** | **Example breakthrough dose calculation** |
|-|-|
| Patient receiving 60 mg/day extended-release oxycodone | Breakthrough dose: 6–12 mg (10–20% of 60 mg) |
| Patient receiving 30 mg/day extended-release morphine | Breakthrough dose: 3–6 mg (10–20% of 30 mg) |
| Patient receiving 100 mg/day extended-release hydromorphone | Breakthrough dose: 10–20 mg (10–20% of 100 mg) |

---

## Monitoring and titration

- **Frequent assessment**: Monitor pain relief, adverse effects, and functional improvement after each breakthrough dose [^d4dab7ae].

- **Dose titration**: Adjust the breakthrough dose based on response. If inadequate, increase to 15–20% of the total daily dose [^notfound].

- **Baseline dose adjustment**: If more than 2–4 breakthrough doses are required per day, increase the extended-release baseline dose rather than continually escalating breakthrough doses [^e159611f].

---

## Safety considerations

- **Respiratory depression**: Use caution, especially in opioid-naive or medically fragile patients [^8e76590a].

- **Sedation and cognitive impairment**: Monitor for excessive sedation, confusion, or dizziness [^c4cb07f2].

- **Naloxone provision**: Consider prescribing naloxone for patients at risk of overdose, such as those on high opioid doses or with concomitant CNS depressants [^ebb3e118].

---

## Alternative approaches

In some cases, **alternative approaches** may be necessary:

- **Transmucosal fentanyl**: For rapid-onset breakthrough pain, transmucosal fentanyl formulations may be more effective due to their rapid onset of action [^e159611f].

- **Non-opioid adjuncts**: Consider non-opioid medications (e.g. NSAIDs, acetaminophen, gabapentinoids) for specific pain types or as adjuncts to reduce opioid burden [^ac498ce2].

---

The standard breakthrough dose is **5–20% of the total daily extended-release opioid dose**, with 10% as a typical starting point. Individualize dosing based on tolerance, age, comorbidities, and pain characteristics, and titrate to effect while monitoring for adverse effects.

### Use of opioids for adults with pain from cancer or cancer treatment: ASCO guideline [^34b78285]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — breakthrough cancer pain (Recommendation 6.2) states that evidence remains insufficient to recommend a specific, short-acting opioid for breakthrough pain. A 2015 systematic review of oral or nasal fentanyl included 11 RCTs with a total of 1,121 patients and found fentanyl effective compared with placebo but with limited evidence relative to other opioids; subsequent trials found fentanyl noninferior to morphine at 30 minutes in 114 patients and favored fentanyl for pain reduction at 30 minutes in 68 patients. For many patients, clinical interpretation advises regular immediate- or extended-release opioid plus an immediate-release opioid for breakthrough episodes at approximately 10% (ranging from 5% to 20%) of the daily MME dose.

### Use of opioids for adults with pain from cancer or cancer treatment: ASCO guideline [^f0ac8512]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Opioid dosing and titration for adults with cancer pain — initial dosing, formulation choice, and adjustments are specified as follows: The initial opioid dose is "a dose of approximately 30 mg of morphine equivalent (MME) per day", and opioids are "usually initiated during a short course of an immediate-release formulation as needed". In stable pain, "the effective dose can often be determined within a few days", and "The US Food and Drug Administration also recommends this practice of as-needed immediate-release opioids before starting regularly scheduled opioids". After the effective dose is determined, extended-release opioids "can be administered by mouth every 12 or 24 hours, or transdermal every 72 hours (fentanyl) or every 7 days (buprenorphine)", whereas immediate-release opioids "need to be administered every 4 hours". For adjustments, "Dose titration can be done a few days after each dose increase or reduction", with changes "calculated as a percentage of the total daily dose (usually approximately 25%-50%)". A practical method is to "add the total daily dose of the regular plus breakthrough opioids and increase this number by 20%-30%", and "keep each dose [of breakthrough opioid] at about 10% (5%-20%) of the regular daily opioid dose".

### Opioids for management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients… [^220901eb]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

In contrast, breakthrough pain usually is episodic and self-limited. It often recurs at certain times of the day or in response to particular triggers. When breakthrough pain occurs as a result of end-of-dose failure it can be prevented by increasing the frequency of opioid dosing — for example, administering sustained-release morphine every eight hours instead of every 12. Only one study compared the effectiveness of OTFC with another opioid. 5 This double-blind crossover study involved 134 patients who already managed their breakthrough pain with immediate-release morphine, which has a slightly slower onset of action than OTFC. During the intervention, patients tended to have more effective relief of breakthrough pain and a more rapid onset of relief with OTFC than with immediate-release morphine. Sixty-four of the 93 patients who completed the study said they would like to continue using OTFC for their breakthrough pain.

These results suggest that select cancer patients might prefer OTFC over immediate-release morphine. Cochrane Abstract Background: Breakthrough pain is a transient increase in pain intensity over background pain. It is a common and distinct component of cancer pain that can have a negative impact on the patient's and caregivers' quality of life. Breakthrough pain usually is related to background pain; typically it is of rapid onset, severe in intensity, and self-limiting, with an average duration of 30 minutes. One approach to managing breakthrough pain is using supplemental analgesia at a dose proportional to the total around-the-clock opioid dosage. A secondary objective of the review was to find evidence supporting the expert opinion of the European Association of Palliative Care that short-acting opioids for breakthrough cancer pain should be given in proportion to the amount of long-acting opioid being taken by the patient.

6 In the four studies reviewed, the optimal safe and effective dose of short-acting opioid varied greatly from patient to patient. Thus, contrary to the EAPC's recommendations, the reviewers conclude that the optimal dose of opioids for breakthrough cancer pain is best determined through trial and error. However, the evidence in this Cochrane review indicates that OTFC, a rapid-acting opioid, is reasonably safe and effective for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain in patients already taking long-acting opioids for cancer pain. In most studies, the rapid-acting opioids were introduced at low dosages and titrated upward gradually to reduce the risk of adverse effects.

### Hydromorphone hydrochloride [^2eab064a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Initial Dosage

Conversion from Other Oral Hydromorphone Formulations to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets

Patients receiving oral immediate-release hydromorphone may be converted to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets by administering a starting dose equivalent to the patient's total daily oral hydromorphone dose, taken once daily.

Conversion from other oral opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets

When hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy is initiated, discontinue all other opioid analgesics other than those used on an as needed basis for breakthrough pain when appropriate.

There is substantial inter-patient variability in the relative potency of different opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour oral hydromorphone dosage and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate-release opioid) than to overestimate the 24-hour oral hydromorphone dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose.

In a hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets clinical trial with an open-label titration period, patients were converted from their prior opioid to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets using the Table 1 as a guide for the initial hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose. The recommended starting dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets is 50% of the calculated estimate of daily hydromorphone requirement. Calculate the estimated daily hydromorphone requirement using Table 1.

### Morphine sulfate (Kadian) [^b3cc2684]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

The first dose of KADIAN®may be taken with the last
dose of any immediate-release (short-acting) opioid medication due to the long
delay until the peak effect after administration of KADIAN®.

There has been no evaluation of KADIAN®as
an initial opioid analgesic in the management of pain. Because it may be more
difficult to titrate a patient to adequate analgesia using an extended-release
morphine, it is ordinarily advisable to begin treatment using an
immediate-release morphine formulation.

The best use of opioid analgesics in the management of chronic
malignant and non-malignant pain is challenging, and is well described in
materials published by the World Health Organization and the Agency for Health
Care Policy and. KADIAN®is a third step drug which is
most useful when the patient requires a constant level of opioid analgesia as a
"floor" or "platform" from which to manage breakthrough pain. When a patient
has reached the point where comfort cannot be provided with a combination of
non-opioid medications (NSAIDs and acetaminophen) and intermittent use of
moderate or strong opioids, the patient's total opioid therapy should be
converted into a 24 hour oral morphine equivalent.

KADIAN®should be started by administering one-half of
the estimated total daily oral morphine dose every 12 hours (twice-a-day) or by administering the total daily oral morphine dose every
24 hours (once-a-day). The dose should be titrated no more frequently than
every-other-day to allow the patients to stabilize before escalating the dose.
If breakthrough pain occurs, the dose may be supplemented with a small dose
(less than 20% of the total daily dose) of a short-acting analgesic. Patients
who are excessively sedated after a once-a-day dose or who regularly experience
inadequate analgesia before the next dose should be switched to twice-a-day
dosing.

### Oxycodone hcl controlled-release [^2ca48451]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Individualization of Dosage

Once therapy is initiated, pain relief and other opioid effects should be frequently assessed. Patients should be titrated to adequate effect (generally mild or no pain with the regular use of no more than two doses of supplemental analgesia per 24 hours). Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment or rescue medication. Because steady-state plasma concentrations are approximated within 24 to 36 hours, dosage adjustment may be carried out every 1 to 2 days. It is most appropriate to increase the q12h dose, not the dosing frequency. There is no clinical information on dosing intervals shorter than q12h. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25% to 50% of the current dose at each increase.

If signs of excessive opioid-related adverse experiences are observed, the next dose may be reduced. If this adjustment leads to inadequate analgesia, a supplemental dose of immediate-release oxycodone may be given. Alternatively, non-opioid analgesic adjuvants may be employed. Dose adjustments should be made to obtain an appropriate balance between pain relief and opioid-related adverse experiences.

If significant adverse events occur before the therapeutic goal of mild or no pain is achieved, the events should be treated aggressively. Once adverse events are under control, upward titration should continue to an acceptable level of pain control.

During periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration, frequent contact is recommended between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient and the caregiver/family.

Special Instructions for Oxycodone HCl Controlled-Release 80 mg Tablets, or a single dose greater than 40 mg (for use in opioid-tolerant patients only.)

Oxycodone HCl Controlled-Release 80 mg Tablets, or a single dose greater than 40 mg, are for use in opioid-tolerant patients only. A single daily dose greater than 40 mg, or total daily doses greater than 80 mg, may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients who are not tolerant to the respiratory depressant effects of opioids. Patients should be instructed against use by individuals other than the patient for whom it was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death.

One Oxycodone HCl Controlled-Release 160 mg tablet is comparable to two 80 mg tablets when taken on an empty stomach. With a high-fat meal, however, there is a 25% greater peak plasma concentration following one 160 mg tablet. Dietary caution should be taken when patients are initially titrated to 160 mg tablets.

### Opioid conversion in adults with cancer: MASCC-ASCO-AAHPM-HPNA-NICSO guideline [^406e6a3f]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for cancer pain, more specifically with respect to opioids, dose adjustments, AAHPM/ASCO/HPNA/MASCC/NICSO 2025 guidelines recommend to initiate immediate-release opioids
at a dose of 5–20% of the daily regular morphine equivalent daily dose for breakthrough pain in patients receiving opioids around the clock.

### Oxycodone hydrochloride oral solution [^93d1d185]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

For control of severe chronic pain, Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution should be administered on a regularly scheduled basis, every 4 to 6 hours, at the lowest dosage level that will achieve adequate analgesia.

Conversion from Other Opioids to Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution

There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution. It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. If a patient has been receiving opioid-containing medications prior to taking Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution, the potency of the prior opioid relative to oxycodone should be factored into the selection of the total daily dose (TDD) of oxycodone.

In converting patients from other opioids to Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution close observation and adjustment of dosage based upon the patient's response to Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution is imperative. Administration of supplemental analgesia for breakthrough or incident pain and titration of the total daily dose of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution may be necessary, especially in patients who have disease states that are changing rapidly.

Conversion from Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution to Extended-Release Oxycodone Hydrochloride

The relative bioavailability of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution compared to extended-release oxycodone is unknown, so conversion to extended-release tablets must be accompanied by close observation for signs of excessive sedation and respiratory depression.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the prescribing of opioids for adult patients in the emergency department [^0fc2bff6]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Long-acting or extended-release opioids in acute pain — use limitations are specified: These products are indicated for chronic pain and should not be used for acute pain; they are for use in opioid-tolerant patients only and are not intended for use as an "as-needed" analgesic. Additionally, immediate-release oral transmucosal fentanyl is indicated only for breakthrough pain relief in cancer patients already taking sustained-release medications and who are opioid tolerant, and these formulations should not be used for acute new-onset pain.

### Use of opioids for adults with pain from cancer or cancer treatment: ASCO guideline [^1a361c35]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — research gaps and future directions for opioid use in adults with cancer pain are presented as prioritized questions, covering comparative effectiveness, dosing strategies, and special populations, and the page provides resource links. Priorities include clinically meaningful differences between opioids in patients with cancer; differences between scheduling an immediate-release opioid with as-needed dosing versus extended-release administration with as-needed immediate-release opioids for breakthrough pain; the preferred opioid for breakthrough pain; and the optimal increase or decrease when modifying opioid dose in response to changes in pain. Additional questions address the clinical impact of renal and hepatic dysfunction on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of each opioid; conversion factors for different opioids and routes and whether these vary based upon dose (low dose v high dose); optimal strategy for opioid switching; strategies for preventing and managing opioid-induced adverse effects; the real-world role of genetic testing in guiding opioid dosing; and the safest and most effective strategies for treating cancer pain in patients with opioid use disorders or nonmedical opioid use. The page also states that cancer clinical trials are vital and that all patients should have the opportunity to participate, and it directs readers to www.asco.org/supportive-care-guidelines and www.cancer.net for more information and patient resources.

### Comparative efficacy of oral extended-release hydromorphone and immediate-release hydromorphone in patients with persistent moderate to severe pain: two randomized controlled trials [^ff785fa8]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2005). Low credibility.

Two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, crossover studies with identical designs evaluated the efficacy of oral extended-release hydromorphone (HHER) administered q24h compared with immediate-release hydromorphone (HHIR) dosed four times daily in patients with persistent moderate to severe pain. Patients titrated to a stable HHER dose were randomized to individualized doses of HHER or HHIR for 3 to 7 days before crossover to the second treatment. Primary efficacy end point was the mean of average pain intensity (API) scores, rated on a 0- to 10-point numeric scale, over the last 2 days before the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics day of each double-blind period. Difference between treatments (HHER - HHIR) in study 1 was 0.17 with a 90% confidence interval (CI) (-0.01, 0.34); in study 2, difference was 0.07 with a 90% CI (-0.12, 0.26). There were no significant differences between treatments in API scores or amount of rescue medication used at any time interval within the 24-hour dosing period. No reduction in pain control occurred in patients administered HHER at the end of the 24-hour dosing period. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were opioid-related. In these studies, HHER administered q24h and HHIR dosed four times daily provided comparable analgesia at an equivalent total daily dose.

### Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia versus oral opioid to maintain analgesia for severe cancer pain: a randomized phase II trial [^c008a8da]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Optimal analgesic maintenance for severe cancer pain is unknown. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IPCA) with continuous infusion plus rescue dose or bolus-only dose versus conventional oral extended-release morphine as a background dose with normal-release morphine as a rescue dose to maintain analgesia in patients with severe cancer pain after successful opioid titration.

Methods

Patients with persistent severe cancer pain (≥ 7 at rest on the 11-point numeric rating scale [NRS]) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms: (A1) IPCA hydromorphone with bolus-only dose where dosage was 10% to 20% of the total equianalgesic over the previous 24 hours (TEOP24H) administered as needed, (A2) IPCA hydromorphone with continuous infusion where dose per hour was the TEOP24H divided by 24 and bolus dosage for breakthrough pain was 10% to 20% of the TEOP24H, and (B) oral extended-release morphine based on TEOP24H/2 × 75% (because of incomplete cross-tolerance) every 12 hours plus normal-release morphine based on TEOP24H × 10% to 20% for breakthrough pain. After randomization, patients underwent IPCA hydromorphone titration for 24 hours to achieve pain control before beginning their assigned treatment. The primary endpoint was NRS over days 1 to 3.

Results

A total of 95 patients from 9 oncology study sites underwent randomization: 30 into arm A1, 32 into arm A2, and 33 into arm B. Arm B produced a significantly higher NRS over days 1 to 3 compared with arm A1 or A2 (P < .001). Daily NRS from day 1 to day 6 and patient satisfaction scores on day 3 and day 6 were worse in arm B. Median equivalent-morphine consumption increase was significantly lower in A1 (P = 0.024) among the 3 arms. No severe adverse event occurred in any arm.

Conclusions

Compared with oral morphine maintenance, IPCA hydromorphone for analgesia maintenance improves control of severe cancer pain after successful titration. Furthermore, IPCA hydromorphone without continuous infusion may consume less opioid.

### Management of breakthrough pain in children with cancer [^25b22051]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Management of breakthrough pain

Breakthrough pain includes such entities as: 1) incidental pain, which is typically induced by a child's movements (which may require adjustment of the dosing regimen and/or an analgesic dose prior to movement such as during physical therapy, going to the bathroom etc), 2) end-of-dose failure (requiring adjustment of the dosing regimen, such as increasing the dose and/or decreasing the dosing interval), and 3) spontaneous pain, where no obvious pathology is apparent. Breakthrough pain in our experience frequently occurs in children with cancer in conjunction with background pain that is usually well managed by multimodal analgesia.

"Classic" routes of opioid administration: intravenous, oral, and rectal

Calculating a "breakthrough" (or "rescue" or PRN) opioid dose in pediatric cancer pain usually involves administering 10% of the total daily dose (in adults, the WHO recommends up to a sixth of the total daily dose) for the immediate-acting opioids morphine, hydromorphone, oxycodone and diamorphine. Fentanyl, due to its short half-life, would be calculated differently.

Example 1 (oral)

A 10-year-old (29 kg) patient receiving immediate-release oxycodone 10 mg orally every 6 hours would receive a total of 40 mg orally per 24 hours. Ten percent of the total daily dose would be 4 mg to be administered every 1–2 hours PRN for breakthrough pain.

Example 2 (IV)

A 1-year-old patient is receiving hydromorphone 0.3 mg IV every 4 hours, which translates into 1.8 mg IV per 24 hours. Ten percent of the total daily dose would be 0.18 mg IV hydromorphone to be administered every 1–2 hours PRN for breakthrough pain.

### Breakthrough cancer pain and rational drug use [^311b32f5]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Fig. 3
Temporal relationship between breakthrough pain episodes and oral morphine treatment. Adapted from with permission

Pain control with only an around-the-clock extended-release opioid medication will lead to a high level of opioid exposure and adverse neurological and gastrointestinal effects, and the profile of extended release opioid does not match that of BTcP (Fig. 4). While using a lower dose of an extended-release opioid together with an immediate-release opioid would result in lower overall exposure compared to a high dose of an extended-release opioid, BTcP is still not well controlled because the characteristics of BTcP do not match that of an immediate-release opioid (i.e. onset of action about 30 min, duration of about 4 h) (Fig. 4). Thus, control of background pain with a low dose of an extended opioid and managing BTcP with a ROO provides a good combination of overall pain control and lower opioid exposure (by matching the temporal characteristics of BTcP) (Fig. 4). Indeed, rapid onset and short duration of action allow good control of analgesia, while the pharmacokinetic properties of ROOs may permit reduction of the total opioid burden and associated adverse effects. Moreover, the efficacy of ROOs has been most effectively demonstrated by a meta-analysis that concluded that it is superior to oral morphine, which in turn is superior to placebo in control of BTcP.

Even when good baseline pain relief has been achieved, most patients will require occasional ' ' doses of analgesia. Uniformly effective breakthrough dosing protocols have not been determined for children with EB at end of life, although there are general recommendations from several international sources, and data to support the use of up to 20% of total daily opioid consumption, in adults with cancer. In general, a short-acting, immediate release form of opioid should be given at approximately 10% to 15% of the total background opioid dose of the previous 24 hours. If rescue dosing is used frequently and consistently, then the baseline opioid dosing needs to be increased. Individual patient factors should be taken into consideration (including prior opioid exposure, renal and hepatic function, other medication use) and consultation with an expert in pain management and/or palliative care is recommended. The same principle is recommended for opioids given via all routes of administration. When very rapid onset is needed, transmucosal administration of opioids may be preferable (see Box 9). Commercially available transmucosal preparations of fentanyl are available in doses likely to be suitable for older children and adults. Evidence supports the use of transbuccal fentanyl for breakthrough pain in cancer patients. An additional benefit of fentanyl is that it is not dependent on renal excretion. In some centers, the injectable formulations of morphine or diamorphine have been used buccally at around a third of the standard enteral dose (equivalent to the intravenous dose), allowing more flexibility of dosing. It is also important to remember that extreme anxiety may confound pain perception or expression and that there may be benefit in offering additional doses of buccal midazolam where this is felt to be a significant factor. Therapy should be targeted at specific symptoms whenever possible, although combination therapy is not unusual. Breakthrough analgesia should be offered in the face of unexplained ' ' in case of undiagnosed pain, after which medication for primary agitation/anxiety may be considered. While it is likely that both of these would cause a degree of sedation at higher doses, this should not be the primary aim of treatment.

Good practice points

Palliative pain care is an expected part of care for EB, which in many cases is life-limiting in nature. All basic principles of palliative care apply as they do for other terminal disease states.

### Patterns of immediate-release and extended-release opioid analgesic use in the management of chronic pain, 2003–2014 [^5ec7a732]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Question

What percentage of patients receiving long-term immediate-release (IR) opioid analgesic therapy in the United States adds or switches to an extended-release/long-acting (ER/LA) formulation?

Findings

In this cohort study, most patients (96.0%) receiving IR formulations for 90 days or longer continued IR opioid analgesic use without adding (3.3%) or switching (0.7%) to an ER/LA product. Furthermore, many patients received only 1 IR (40%) and/or 1 ER/LA (41%) prescription throughout the 12-year study period.

Meaning

Most patients receiving opioid analgesics use IR formulations, and patients receiving long-term IR opioid analgesic therapy are unlikely to add or switch to an ER/LA formulation.

Morphine

Except in specific situations, oral morphine is the first-line WHO level 3 opioid of choice (standard, expert agreement). Oral morphine should be given without delay to patients whose pain is uncontrolled by step 1 and 2 treatments (standard, expert agreement).

Morphine should be prescribed in an oral form, either as tablets or capsules of immediate-release morphine sulphate, as tablets or capsules of sustained-release morphine sulphate, or as morphine hydrochloride solution (standard, expert agreement).

In all patients treated previously with another strong opioid, the starting dose for morphine should be calculated using equianalgesic dose ratios (standard, expert agreement).

In patients receiving baseline treatment with opioids, an immediate-release formulation must be prescribed concurrently for the treatment of breakthrough or incident pain (standard, expert agreement).

It is advisable to be cautious by prescribing doses at the lower end of the equianalgesic dose range and providing rescue doses as needed, rather than immediately subjecting the patients to doses at the upper limit of the range (standard, expert agreement).

When oral administration is impossible, the preferred routes are transdermal (e.g. fentanyl), or continuous parenteral administration with patient-controlled analgesia (e.g. morphine) (option, expert agreement). The choice of dose should take into consideration equianalgesic dose ratios (recommendation, expert agreement).

The other routes of administration for morphine and the other opioids are rarely indicated. They should be used taking into consideration the benefit to risk ratio, the training of the personnel involved (including close family and friends), and the constraints of the follow-up, particularly for patients at home (recommendation, expert agreement).

Treatment with opioids (particularly oral morphine) should never be stopped abruptly (standard, expert agreement). No specific protocol for reducing the dose of opioids has been validated. Dose reduction should be in steps of 30–50% over about a week, depending on the clinical situation (reappearance of pain, development of withdrawal symptoms, etc.) (recommendation, expert agreement).

### 2017 HIVMA of IDSA clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic pain in patients living with HIV [^123b054b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Methadone dosing for chronic pain in persons living with HIV — when using opioid treatment programs — includes split dosing and adjunct options as follows: The splitting of methadone into 6- to 8-hour doses is recommended to lengthen analgesia with the goal of continuous pain control, and providers may add 5%-10% of the current methadone dose as afternoon and evening doses for a total 10%-20% increase when prescribing remaining daily doses for opioid use disorder. If prescribing additional methadone is not possible, an additional medication may be recommended based on pain etiology, and acute exacerbations or "breakthrough pain" should be treated with small amounts of short-acting opioid analgesics in patients at low risk for opioid misuse, with providers and patients agreeing on pill number, frequency, and expected duration.

### Response to oral immediate-release opioids for breakthrough pain in patients with advanced cancer with adequately controlled background pain [^18d76899]. The Oncologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

There is limited evidence about the response of breakthrough pain (BTP) to the most commonly used oral immediate-release (IR) opioids. Our aim was to determine response rate to oral IR opioids for BTP control in patients with advanced cancer.

Materials and Methods

In this prospective study, palliative care outpatients, with advanced cancer and adequately managed background pain, were asked to complete a self-administered survey. We assessed patients' baseline demographics, pain characteristics, alcoholism (CAGE questionnaire), tobacco and substance abuse, and Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scores (ESAS). We determined the effectiveness of oral IR BTP opioids by using a 7-point Likert scale ranging from "very ineffective" to "very effective". "Effective" and "very effective" were defined a priori as a good response to IR opioids for BTP.

Results

Of 592 evaluable patients, 192 (32%) had background pain of ≤ 3 (ESAS pain scale 0–10). Among these 192 patients, 152 (79%) reported BTP, 143/152 (94%) took oral IR opioids for BTP, and 127/143 (89%) responded to a median dose of 10% of the total morphine equivalent daily dose. In univariate logistic regression analysis, younger age (odds ratio [OR], 0.94 per year; p = .008), higher ESAS scores for pain (OR, 1.32; p = .012), anxiety (OR, 1.24; p = .017), and dyspnea (OR, 1.31; p = .007) had statistically significant association with poor response to IR opioids for BTP. In multicovariate logistic regression, adjusted for age, a higher ESAS dyspnea score was significantly associated with poor response to oral IR opioids (OR, 1.44; p = .002).

Conclusion

The vast majority of patients with advanced cancer with adequately controlled background pain reported a good response to oral IR opioids for BTP, supporting their use in clinical practice.

Implications For Practice

Oral immediate-release opioids are standard treatment for cancer breakthrough pain. However, information regarding treatment response to these commonly used opioids is limited. This study provides information that the vast majority of patients with advanced cancer, with adequately controlled background pain, reported good response to oral immediate release opioids for managing their breakthrough pain episodes. Results of this study support the use of conventional oral immediate release opioids that are relatively inexpensive and readily available for management of breakthrough pain in patients with advanced cancer.

Regarding medical management for cancer pain, more specifically with respect to opioids, dose adjustments, ESMO 2018 guidelines recommend to consider using standard normal-release oral opioids, such as morphine, for slow-onset breakthrough cancer pain or for pre-emptive administration approximately 30 minutes before predictable breakthrough cancer pain triggered by known events.

### Challenges of pain control and the role of the ambulatory pain specialist in the outpatient surgery setting [^7d574e70]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

In chronically opioid-consuming patients, the shift to an oral opioid requires particular attentiveness. Inpatients need opioids for a comparatively extended duration of time epidurally or intravenously relative to those required in opioid-naïve patients. There is no widely acknowledged guideline as to the method in which postoperative transition to an oral opioid regimen is optimally accomplished in outpatients. Carroll et alrecommended (for inpatients) converting the intravenous dose into its equivalent oral dose, giving half to two-thirds of this amount as a long-acting opioid, and keeping the remaining dose available as an administered short-acting opioid as needed. In effect, short-acting opioids can address any breakthrough pain, and long-acting opioids can function as a stable baseline of pain management. As postoperative pain begins to diminish, reducing the dosage of a short-acting opioid seems to be an effective method in reducing the total dose of opioids administered daily.

### Management of breakthrough pain in children with cancer [^c9b626b1]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Dosing at regular intervals ("by the clock")

Regular scheduling ensures a steady blood level, reducing the peaks and troughs of "as needed" (pro re nata [PRN]) dosing. Dosing that is "PRN only" (without scheduled analgesia) may take several hours and require higher opioid doses to relieve pain; it may result in cycles of undermedication and associated pain, alternating with periods of overmedication and possible drug toxicity. Commonly used opioid regimens include immediate-release oral morphine every 4 hours, or controlled-release morphine twice daily, plus a PRN dose of 10% of the 24-hour morphine requirement as an hourly fast-release breakthrough pain medication (the same holds true for both medications). Most pediatric medical institutions in developed countries administer opioids to children with cancer using a continuous infusion of one opioid (typically morphine, fentanyl, or hydromorphone; or in the UK, diamorphine) plus a PCA bolus (see Table 2). If a child is too young or unable to push the PCA button, many institutions, including ours, will implement a nurse-controlled analgesia (NCA) bolus policy. In our previous breakthrough cancer pain study, none of the children had uncontrolled background pain after 48 hours of scheduled opioids.

### Hydromorphone hydrochloride [^5ec6e9e6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Example conversion from a single opioid to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets:

Step 1: Sum the total daily dose of the opioid

30 mg of oxycodone 2 times daily = 60 mg total daily dose of oxycodone

Step 2: Calculate the approximate equivalent dose of oral hydromorphone based on the total daily dose of the current opioid using Table 1

60 mg total daily dose of oxycodone x Conversion Factor of 0.4 = 24 mg of oral hydromorphone daily

Step 3: Calculate the approximate starting dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to be given every 24 hours, which is 50% of the calculated oral hydromorphone dose. Round down, if necessary, to the appropriate hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets strengths available.

50% of 24 mg results in an initial dose of 12 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily
Adjust individually for each patient

Close observation and frequent titration are warranted until pain management is stable on the new opioid. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal or for signs of over-sedation/toxicity after converting patients to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets.

Thus, any decisions regarding the use a specific rescue medication, usually a ROO formulation, for treatment of BTcP should be based on a combination of four factors: (1) the characteristics of BTcP, including temporal characteristics like duration and time to peak intensity (median duration is 60 min and median time to peak intensity is 10 min); (2) the drug's characteristics, including pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (short-acting opioids, such as immediate release oral morphine, are not the treatment of choice for BTcP because the onset of analgesia starts after 30–45 min with an analgesic duration of about 4 h, which does not match the temporal profile of BTcP episodes); (3) previous response to opioids (e.g. efficacy and tolerability); and (4) the patient's preference for a specific route of administration (up to 65% of patients prefer an oral transmucosal route) (Fig. 5). In this light, it is unlikely that any single ROO formulations will be suitable for all patients with BTcP.

### Fentanyl [^1b8c3f6a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy

Individually titrate fentanyl transdermal system to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reaction, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.21)]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During use of opioid therapy for an extended period of time, periodically reassess the continued need for use of opioid analgesics.

Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dosage adjustment of fentanyl transdermal system, or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate-release analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the fentanyl transdermal system dosage.

The dosing interval for fentanyl transdermal system is 72 hours. Do not increase the fentanyl transdermal system dose for the first time until at least 3 days after the initial application. Titrate the dose based on the daily dose of supplemental opioid analgesics required by the patient on the second or third day of the initial application.

It may take up to 6 days for fentanyl levels to reach equilibrium on a new dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, evaluate patients for further titration after no less than two 3-day applications before any further increase in dosage is made.

Base dosage increments on the daily dosage of supplementary opioids, using the ratio of 45 mg/24 hours of oral morphine to a 12 mcg/hour increase in fentanyl transdermal system dose.

If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Adjust the dose to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.

A small proportion of adult patients may not achieve adequate analgesia using a 72-hour dosing interval and may require systems to be applied at 48 hours rather than at 72 hours, only if adequate pain control cannot be achieved using a 72-hour regimen. An increase in the fentanyl transdermal system dose should be evaluated before changing dosing intervals in order to maintain patients on a 72-hour regimen.

Dosing intervals less than every 72 hours were not studied in children and adolescents and are not recommended.

### A multicenter, primary-care-based, open-label study to assess the success of converting opioid-experienced patients with chronic moderate-to-severe pain to morphine sulfate and naltrexone hydrochloride extended-release capsules using a standardized conversion guide [^2625df6d]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Study design

The study comprised three phases: screening, titration, and maintenance (Figure 1). Screening consisted of a single visit (Visit 1) during which standard medical screening to determine eligibility took place. During this visit, consenting patients completed a baseline Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)and a confidential Self-Reported Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion (SR-MAD) questionnaire. (Data from SR-MAD are published separately in this volume.) During the titration stage, lasting up to 6 weeks, all patients were converted to MSN. Conversion to MSN was standardized for all investigators using the MSN conversion guide provided with the protocol (Supplementary materials). However, the conversion guide instructions indicated that the actual dose should be based on clinical judgment and adjusted on an individual basis. The selection of the initial dose of MSN for each patient was based upon the following considerations and information: 1) the total daily dose, potency, and type of opioid the patient had been taking previously; 2) the reliability of the relative potency estimate used to calculate the equivalent dose of morphine needed (potency estimates may vary with the route of administration) to replace the patient's opioid; 3) the type and severity of the patient's pain; 4) the patient's degree of opioid experience and tolerance; 5) the general condition and medical status of the patient; and 6) the patient's concomitant medications. A stable dose was defined by all of the following criteria: 1) a dose that has been taken for at least 48 hours; 2) a dose that the investigator deemed had achieved the balance between an acceptable level of analgesia and/or function, and tolerance of side effects; and 3) a dose that allows for rescue medication use of no more than two doses per day. At the discretion of the investigator, rescue medication was allowed so as to provide supplemental analgesia for breakthrough pain during titration; rescue medications included IR morphine (< 20% of the total daily dose of MSN per IR dose), ibuprofen (up to 400 mg/dose, not to exceed 1,200 mg/day), and acetaminophen (up to 1,000 mg/dose, not to exceed 4,000 mg/day). Subsequent visits (Visits 2b–e) were optional if the patient required additional dose adjustments, and occurred every 5 days (± 2 days) following the previous visit to a maximum of 6 weeks. If a patient did not achieve a stable dose by 6 weeks, he or she was discontinued from the study. Patients who achieved a stable MSN dose returned to the clinic for Visit 3 and completed a BPI. At this visit, the investigator completed a conversion assessment survey, a brief questionnaire using multiple choice options and an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) with specified anchored responses, ranging on a scale from 0 (not useful) to 10 (very useful). During the maintenance stage, lasting 8 weeks, patients completed a BPI (Visits 4 and 5) and women underwent a urine pregnancy test (Visit 5 only).

### Tramadol hydrochloride (Conzip) [^05b40d1d]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.3	Initial Dosage

Patients Not Currently on a Tramadol Product

The initial dose of CONZIP is 100 mg once daily.

Patients Currently on Tramadol Immediate-Release (IR) Products

Calculate the 24-hour tramadol IR dose and initiate a total daily dose of CONZIP rounded down to the next lowest 100 mg increment. The dose may subsequently be individualized according to patient need.

Due to limitations in flexibility of dose selection with CONZIP, some patients maintained on tramadol IR products may not be able to convert to CONZIP.

Conversion from Other Opioids to CONZIP

When CONZIP therapy is initiated, discontinue all other opioid analgesics other than those used on an as needed basis for breakthrough pain when appropriate. There are no established conversion ratios for conversion from other opioids to CONZIP defined by clinical trials. Initiate dosing using CONZIP 100 mg once a day.

It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour tramadol requirements and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate-release opioid) than to overestimate the 24-hour tramadol dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to an overdose. While useful tables of opioid equivalents are readily available, there is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations.

Close observation and frequent titration are warranted until pain management is stable on the new opioid. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and for signs of oversedation/toxicity after converting patients to CONZIP.

### Opioids for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients [^843f78a0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 1, 2006). Breakthrough pain is a transient exacerbation of pain that occurs either spontaneously or in relation to a specific predictable or unpredictable trigger despite relative stable and adequately controlled background pain. Breakthrough pain usually related to background pain and is typically of rapid onset, severe in intensity and generally self limiting with a mean duration of 30 minutes. Breakthrough pain has traditionally been managed by the administration of supplemental oral analgesia (rescue medication) at a dose proportional to the total around-the-clock (ATC) opioid dose.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of opioid analgesics given by any route, used for the management of breakthrough pain in patients with cancer, and to identify and quantify, if data permitted, any adverse effects of this treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and trial registries in January 2005 for the original review, and again on 6 February 2013 for this update.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of opioids used as rescue medication against active or placebo comparator in patients with cancer pain. Outcome measures sought were reduction in pain intensity measured by an appropriate scale, adverse effects, attrition, patient satisfaction and quality of life. We applied no language restrictions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected and examined eligible studies. We retrieved full text if any uncertainty about eligibility remained. We screened non-English texts. We conducted quality assessment and data extraction using standardised data forms. We compared drug and placebo dose, titration, route and formulation and recorded details of all outcome measures (if available).

Main Results

The original review included four studies (393 participants), all concerned with the use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) in the management of breakthrough pain. Two studies examined the titration of OTFC, one study compared OTFC versus normal-release morphine and one study compared OTFC versus placebo. Fifteen studies (1699 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this update. All studies reported on the utility of seven different transmucosal fentanyl formulations, five of which were administered orally and two nasally. Eight studies compared the transmucosal fentanyl formulations versus placebo, four studies compared them with another opioid, one study was a comparison of different doses of the same formulation and two were randomised titration studies. Oral and nasal transmucosal fentanyl formulations were an effective treatment for breakthrough pain. When compared with placebo or oral morphine, participants gave lower pain intensity and higher pain relief scores for transmucosal fentanyl formulations at all time points. Global assessment scores also favoured transmucosal fentanyl preparations. One study compared intravenous with the transmucosal route and both were effective.

Authors' Conclusions

Oral and nasal transmucosal fentanyl is an effective treatment in the management of breakthrough pain. The RCT literature for the management of breakthrough pain is relatively small. Given the importance of this subject, more trials, including head-to-head comparisons of the available transmucosal fentanyl formulations are required.

### A long-term, open-label safety study of single-entity hydrocodone bitartrate extended release for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain [^e54e8421]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Treatments

HC-ER was supplied as 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mg capsules. The current opioid dose was converted to the recommended dose of HC-ER using an opioid conversion table, then this value was reduced by approximately 20%–30% at the discretion of the investigator to determine the starting dose of HC-ER. Dosing throughout the study was twice daily at 12-hour intervals (q12h).

During the C/T phase, HC-ER doses were titrated from the initial HC-ER dose in increments of 20 mg/day (ie, 10 mg q12h) every 3–7 days until a stabilized dose had been achieved. A stabilized dose was achieved when a subject tolerated the treatment well and had an average 24-hour pain score of ≤ 4 on the numerical rating scale (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain) during the 7 days prior to entering the maintenance phase and no more than two doses of rescue medication (HC-IR/APAP 5/500 mg) on any day. Subjects also were allowed one downtitration for reasons of tolerability during the C/T phase. Subjects who could not achieve a stabilized dose in 6 weeks were discontinued from the study.

Upon reaching a stabilized dose, subjects entered the maintenance phase and continued HC-ER at their stabilized dose. During the maintenance phase, the dose of HC-ER was permitted to be adjusted up or down at any study visit at the investigator's discretion, for reasons of efficacy or tolerability, without a limit to the number of adjustments. If a dose adjustment was necessary, the investigator adjusted the HC-ER dose first and then could add nonopioid analgesics in a manner consistent with standard practice. Subjects were permitted rescue medication of one to two tablets of HC-IR/APAP 5/500 mg every 4–6 hours with a maximum of two tablets per day for breakthrough pain. Patients recorded the use of rescue medication daily in their study diary.

### Morphine sulfate (MS contin) [^3ccbbaca]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Conversion from Other Opioids to MS CONTIN

When MS CONTIN therapy is initiated, discontinue all other opioid analgesics other than those used on an as needed basis for breakthrough pain when appropriate.

There are no established conversion ratios for conversion from other opioids to MS CONTIN defined by clinical trials. Initiate dosing using MS CONTIN 15 mg orally every 8 to 12 hours.

It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour oral morphine dosage and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate-release opioid) than to overestimate the 24-hour oral morphine dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to an overdose. While useful tables of opioid equivalents are readily available, there is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Close observation and frequent titration are warranted until pain management is stable on the new opioid. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and for signs of oversedation/toxicity after converting patients to MS CONTIN.

Conversion from Parenteral Morphine or Other Opioids (Parenteral or Oral) to MS CONTIN

When converting from parenteral morphine or other non-morphine opioids (parenteral or oral) to MS CONTIN, consider the following general points:

Parenteral to oral morphine ratio: Between 2 to 6 mg of oral morphine may be required to provide analgesia equivalent to 1 mg of parenteral morphine. Typically, a dose of morphine that is approximately three times the previous daily parenteral morphine requirement is sufficient.

Other parenteral or oral non-morphine opioids to oral morphine ratios: Specific recommendations are not available because of a lack of systematic evidence for these types of analgesic substitutions. Published relative potency data are available, but such ratios are approximations. In general, begin with half of the estimated daily morphine requirement as the initial dose, managing inadequate analgesia by supplementation with immediate-release morphine.

Conversion from Methadone to MS CONTIN

Regular evaluation is of particular importance when converting methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long half-life and can accumulate in the plasma.

Conversion from Other Oral Oxycodone Formulations to OXYCONTIN

If switching from other oral oxycodone formulations to OXYCONTIN, administer one half of the patient's total daily oral oxycodone dose as OXYCONTIN every 12 hours.

Conversion from Other Opioids to OXYCONTIN When OXYCONTIN therapy is initiated, discontinue all other opioid analgesics other than those used on an as needed basis for breakthrough pain when appropriate.

There are no established conversion ratios for conversion from other opioids to OXYCONTIN defined by clinical trials. Initiate dosing using OXYCONTIN 10 mg orally every 12 hours.

It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour oral oxycodone requirements and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate-release opioid) than to overestimate the 24-hour oral oxycodone dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to an overdose. While useful tables of opioid equivalents are readily available, there is substantial inter-patient variability in the relative potency of different opioids.

Close observation and frequent titration are warranted until pain management is stable on the new opioid. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and for signs of oversedation/toxicity after converting patients to OXYCONTIN.

Conversion from Methadone to OXYCONTIN

Regular evaluation is of particular importance when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long half-life and can accumulate in the plasma.

Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to OXYCONTIN

Treatment with OXYCONTIN can be initiated after the transdermal fentanyl patch has been removed for at least 18 hours. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, start with a conservative conversion: substitute 10 mg of OXYCONTIN every 12 hours for each 25 mcg per hour fentanyl transdermal patch. Follow the patient closely during conversion from transdermal fentanyl to OXYCONTIN, as there is limited documented experience with this conversion.

### Digital analgesic comprising a second-generation digital health system: increasing effectiveness by optimizing the dosing and minimizing side effects [^9daf823d]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Dose Alterations and Drug Holidays Can Improve the Effectiveness of Chronic Use of Opioids

Treatment regimens based on fixed dosing and times of administration of chronic drugs are not in line with the variability inherent in biological systems. These regimens may contribute to a high primary and secondary lack of response to chronic drug administration. The development of tolerance to opioids is a significant challenge for their safe use. It is associated with a loss of response and increased dosages while increasing the risk of side effects.

Strategies for mitigating opioid tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia include lowering dosages, shortening the duration of treatment by interrupting infusions of sedative or analgesic agents daily, modulating infusions based on analgesic assessment and sedation scores, using multimodal analgesic agents (nerve blocks and non-opioid analgesics), and by rotating analgesic agents sequentially.

Improving opioid effectiveness and minimizing side effects can be achieved through drug holidays and dose alterations. Drug holidays and intermittent dose escalations and reductions can improve the response rate to chronic therapies. Models of drug holidays developed to regenerate responsiveness to opioids lost during the development of tolerance. Drug holidays may help manage opioid tolerance. There have been reports of positive outcomes of drug holidays in patients with chronic pain and opioid addiction, including anesthesia-based detoxification in extreme cases. There is an increase in post-surgical complications that are dose-dependent on opioids. A retrospective study of 8559 patients undergoing revision of total hip arthroplasty showed that an "opioid holiday" in patients with chronic treatment lowers complications.

Patients suffering from cancer-associated pain suffer from episodic breakthrough pain while receiving a stable dose of opioids. Dosing of an immediate-release opioid administered in a proportion of the total daily dose in many cases. In a double-blind, randomized trial, three-dose proportions (1/6, 1/8, and 1/12 of the total daily dose) were administered in two parts, each with three dose proportions in random order. When patients required opioid breakthrough doses, they took the next numbered bottle rather than their usual breakthrough dose. The study results did not show any difference between the three-dose proportions regarding the decrease in pain intensity, pain control on a subsequent day, time to pain relief, or any difference in side effects. The study showed that 1/12 the 24 hourly doses should be the lowest dose that delivers benefit. In a retrospective trial of patients with chronic osteoarthritis pain, a short-acting opioid provided a safer and cheaper alternative to long-acting opioid therapy.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate [^ebb3e118]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.2 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose

Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program).

Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3)].

Consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose.

2.3 Initial Dosage

Use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate Extended-Release Tablets as the First Opioid Analgesic (opioid-naïve patients)

Initiate treatment with hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets at a dose of 20 mg orally every 24 hours.

Use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate Extended-Release Tablets in Patients who are not Opioid Tolerant (opioid non-tolerant patients)

The starting dose for patients who are not opioid tolerant is hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets 20 mg orally every 24 hours.

Use of higher starting doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Conversion from Oral Hydrocodone Formulations to Hydrocodone Bitartrate Extended-Release Tablets

Patients receiving other oral hydrocodone-containing formulations may be converted to hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets by administering the patient's total daily oral hydrocodone dose as hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets once daily.

Conversion from Other Opioids to Hydrocodone Bitartrate Extended-Release Tablets

When hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets therapy is initiated, discontinue all other opioid analgesics other than those used on an as needed basis for breakthrough pain when appropriate.

### Dosing considerations with transdermal formulations of fentanyl and buprenorphine for the treatment of cancer pain [^1778b56d]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Breakthrough pain and withdrawal

Breakthrough or transient pain is described as brief exacerbations of pain that occur in the background of stabilized pain management adequately controlled by around-the-clock (ATC) SR opioid therapy. Transient pain is treated with adjunctive PRN doses of PO IR opioids (morphine, oxycodone, or hydrocodone), as well as buccal or intra-nasal fentanyl in concert with an appropriate ATC SR opioid therapy. IR transmucosal fentanyl doses should be titrated according to patient response. Adequate pain relief from first dose of TD-O should be evaluated at initiation of pharmacotherapy and continued over the first 3–5 days of administration. The goal is to limit the number of breakthrough pain doses such that the patient's life is disrupted as little as possible during their day and at rest.

If more than two doses are required for breakthrough pain over a 24-hour period in order to achieve adequate pain control once steady state has been reached, then the clinician may consider increasing the TD-O dose.TD-Fe dosage increases are usually 25%–33% of the patch strength and based on the patient's response to therapy. The ideal dose of TD-O is individualized and determined by continued evaluation of pain control and use of breakthrough pain pharmacotherapy.

For minimal withdrawal symptoms, patients should be counseled to utilize their scheduled IR opioid every 3–4 hours and not PRN during the transition period. The withdrawal prevention or bridge dose of IR PO opioid should be equal to 10%–15% of the previous 24 hour opioid dose taken prior to beginning TD-Fe pharmacotherapy. Patients can also self-medicate with additional doses or IR opioids about every 2 hours, PRN, if they experience breakthrough pain during this initial period and thereafter.

Oxycodone extended-release (ER) — formulations, initial dosing, titration, bioequivalence, special populations, and administration are specified as follows: Tablets are available in 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 60, and 80 mg strengths for every 12 hr administration and capsules in 9, 13.5, 18, 27 and 36 mg strengths for every 12 hr administration. Opioid-naïve patients start at 10 mg (tablets) or 9 mg (capsules) orally every 12 hr; opioid tolerant patients should convert to the equianalgesic daily dose of oxycodone ER and reduce the calculated amount by 33–50% for the initial start dose. Dose change increments may increase to 20 mg (tablets) or 18 mg (capsules) every 12 hr after 1 or 2 days, and thereafter the total daily dose may be increased by 25–50% every 1 or 2 days. ER tablets are not bioequivalent to ER capsules; 10 mg oxycodone HCl (ER tablet) = 9 mg oxycodone base (ER capsule), and steady state is achieved in 24 to 36 hr with repeat dosing. In special populations, plasma concentrations are increased ~15% in the elderly, ~50% in patients with renal dysfunction with CrCl < 60 ml/min, and patients with hepatic dysfunction should reduce initial dose to 1/3 to 1/2 of the usual dose and monitor closely. Other considerations include that it is recommended for patients who experience intolerable, unmanageable adverse effects to long- acting morphine; both ER tablets and ER capsules have abuse deterrent labeling; ER tablets should be swallowed whole, not broken, chewed, or crushed; and ER capsules may be opened and sprinkled on soft food or administered via feeding tube.

2.2.2 The WHO Pain Ladder in Practice — prescribing and breakthrough dosing states that effective use starts with a complete patient assessment, with analgesia prescribed according to pain severity and adjuvant needs; regular review is required to decide movement on the ladder; regular analgesia around the clock (ATC) is essential for chronic cancer pain; the daily dose is usually given as a long-acting preparation, for example, twice-daily slow-release morphine; a separate prescription is required for breakthrough pain; the dose of short-acting opioid for breakthrough pain is conventionally calculated as equivalent to one-sixth of the daily opioid requirement, and immediate-release morphine sulfate is commonly used; both oral morphine and the one-sixth rule for breakthrough dosing are being increasingly challenged; no pain is predictably unresponsive to opioids, although neuropathic pain responses may be incomplete.

### Clinical efficacy and safety of once-daily dosing of a novel, prolonged-release oral morphine tablet compared with twice-daily dosing of a standard controlled-release morphine tablet in patients with cancer pain: a randomized, double-blind, exploratory crossover study [^62c6a5bf]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Recently, a new oral prolonged-release formulation of morphine sulfate for once-daily dosing has been developed based on an injection-molded matrix (abuse-deterrent, prolonged-release erodible matrix [ADPREM]).

Objectives

The objective of this double-blind, randomized, exploratory crossover study was to assess the efficacy and safety of once-daily ADPREM compared with twice-daily controlled-release morphine (CRM; MST ContinusNapp Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, UK).

Methods

Thirty-eight adult cancer pain patients participated in the study, which consisted of a run-in period for stabilization and two consecutive fixed-dose treatment periods of two weeks' duration each. Rescue medication, immediate-release morphine sulfate, was available during the entire study for treatment of breakthrough pain (BTP).

Results

There was no difference between the treatments in use of rescue medication. The medians of the average number of rescue doses per day were 1.0 and 0.7 during the ADPREM and CRM treatment periods, respectively, with an estimated median difference of 0.07 dose/day (95% confidence interval: -0.21, 0.29). Likewise, no differences between treatments were found for the number of BTP episodes per day or morning and evening ratings of pain intensity (current, average, minimum, and maximum). Median assessment of the drugs was "good" for both treatments, and neither of the treatments was preferred. Steady-state trough concentrations of morphine and its metabolites in plasma before morning dosing were similar after either treatment period. The adverse events were as expected in an opioid-treated cancer population and showed no differences between ADPREM and CRM.

Conclusion

In this study, dosing with ADPREM at intervals of 24 hours was therapeutically equivalent to CRM dosed at intervals of 12 hours.

### Oxycodone (Xtampza) [^776b0a67]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.5	Titration and Maintenance of Therapy

Individually titrate XTAMPZA ER to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving XTAMPZA ER to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During use of opioid therapy for an extended period of time, periodically reassess the continued need for the use of opioid analgesics.

Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dose increase of XTAMPZA ER or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate-release analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dose stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the XTAMPZA ER dose. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after a dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.

Because steady-state plasma concentrations are approximated in 1 to 2 days, XTAMPZA ER dosage may be adjusted every 1 to 2 days. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, the subsequent dose may be reduced. Adjust the dose to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.

There are no well-controlled clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy with dosing more frequently than every 12 hours. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25% to 50% of the current dose, each time an increase is clinically indicated.

### Fentanyl (fentanyl system) [^c0146880]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.4 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy

Individually titrate fentanyl transdermal system to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.21)]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During use of opioid therapy for an extended period of time, periodically reassess the continued need for opioid analgesics.

Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dosage adjustment of fentanyl transdermal system, or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate-release analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the fentanyl transdermal system dosage.

The dosing interval for fentanyl transdermal system is 72 hours. Do not increase the fentanyl transdermal system dose for the first time until at least 3 days after the initial application. Titrate the dose based on the daily dose of supplemental opioid analgesics required by the patient on the second or third day of the initial application.

It may take up to 6 days for fentanyl levels to reach equilibrium on a new dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, evaluate patients for further titration after no less than two 3-day applications before any further increase in dosage is made.

Base dosage increments on the daily dosage of supplementary opioids, using the ratio of 45 mg/24 hours of oral morphine to a 12 mcg/hour increase in fentanyl transdermal system dose.

If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, (including an increase in pain after dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Adjust the dose to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.

A small proportion of adult patients may not achieve adequate analgesia using a 72-hour dosing interval and may require systems to be applied at 48 hours rather than at 72 hours, only if adequate pain control cannot be achieved using a 72-hour regimen. An increase in the fentanyl transdermal system dose should be evaluated before changing dosing intervals in order to maintain patients on a 72-hour regimen.

Dosing intervals less than every 72 hours were not studied in children and adolescents and are not recommended.

### Patterns of immediate-release and extended-release opioid analgesic use in the management of chronic pain, 2003–2014 [^6a3dfdd2]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Most patients receiving opioid analgesics, whether for short or extended periods, use IR formulations. In addition, once receiving long-term IR opioid analgesic therapy, patients are unlikely to add or switch to an ER/LA formulation, even after more than 1 year of continuous IR opioid analgesic therapy. Therefore, while recent FDA changes to IR opioid analgesic labeling may improve awareness of risks associated with IR formulations, ongoing efforts are needed to ensure their appropriate use in both acute pain and chronic pain settings.

### CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain… [^42c8b20e]. CDC (2023). Medium credibility.

Most recently, analysis of data from the 2012 National Health Interview Study showed that 11. 2% of adults report having daily pain. Clinicians should consider the full range of therapeutic options for the treatment of chronic pain. However, it is hard to estimate the number of persons who could potentially benefit from opioid pain medication long term. Evidence supports short-term efficacy of opioids for reducing pain and improving function in noncancer nociceptive and neuropathic pain in randomized clinical trials lasting primarily ≤ 12 weeks, and patients receiving opioid therapy for chronic pain report some pain relief when surveyed. However, few studies have been conducted to rigorously assess the long-term benefits of opioids for chronic pain with outcomes examined at least 1 year later. On the basis of data available from health systems, researchers estimate that 9. 6–11.

5 million adults, or approximately 3%–4% of the adult U. S. population, were prescribed long-term opioid therapy in 2005. Opioid pain medication use presents serious risks, including overdose and opioid use disorder. From 1999 to 2014, more than 165, 000 persons died from overdose related to opioid pain medication in the United States died from opioid-related overdose. 29–31). Existing guidelines share some common elements, including dosing thresholds, cautious titration, and risk mitigation strategies such as using risk assessment tools, treatment agreements, and urine drug testing.

However, there is considerable variability in the specific recommendations, audience, use of evidence, and rigor of methods for addressing conflict of interest.

### OxyContin was submitted and justifiably approved by the agency as a 12-hour dosage form [^2582cf8e]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

According to oxycodone CR's FDA-approved label, "patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment or rescue medication". This translates to using higher doses at 12-hour intervals or supplementing with IR; however, when considering patient uniqueness, it is plausible that neither option is optimal. Raising the dose while maintaining a 12-hour interval will increase the area under the curve but will also result in increased serum fluctuations causing a greater difference between the peak and trough. Supplementing with IR oxycodone at scheduled intervals introduces additional peaks producing additional serum fluctuations. Instead, the optimal approach may be to administer one-third of the total daily dose every 8 hours. What are the drawbacks of peaks and troughs? High peaks are associated with dose-related adverse effects including sedation and potential life-threatening respiratory depression, whereas low troughs are associated with rebound pain. Therefore, one benefit of CR opioids is to maintain constant blood levels by minimizing peaks and troughs exhibited by their IR opioid counterparts. There are certainly advantages to IR opioids, particularly the lesser effect on hypoadrenal axis. Notwithstanding, the side-effect profile, more restful sleep, and compliance are all generally superior for CR compared to IR.–

### Dose conversion and titration with a novel, once-daily, OROS osmotic technology, extended-release hydromorphone formulation in the treatment of chronic malignant or nonmalignant pain [^8232bb51]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this open-label, repeated-dose, single-treatment, multicenter study was to evaluate the outcomes associated with a standardized conversion from prior opioid therapy to a novel, once-daily, OROS osmotic technology, extended-release (ER) hydromorphone formulation in an outpatient population with chronic malignant or nonmalignant pain. The study period was divided into 3 phases: the prior opioid stabilization phase (≥ 3 days), the conversion and titration phase (3–21 days), and the maintenance phase (14 days). Patients were evaluated at 5 visits during the study period. Analgesic efficacy was measured using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). At baseline, patients were required to have daily oral morphine equivalent requirements of ≥ 45 mg. Prior oral or transdermal opioid therapy was converted to single daily doses of ER hydromorphone (8, 16, 32, and 64 mg tablets) at a 5:1 (morphine equivalent to hydromorphone) ratio. Immediate-release (IR) hydromorphone was given as rescue medication for breakthrough pain. Among the 445 patients who enrolled, 404 received the study medication. Of these, 73 (18.1%) had chronic malignant pain and 331 (81.9%) had chronic nonmalignant pain. Dose stabilization (defined as a 3-day period during which the total daily dose of ER hydromorphone remained unchanged and ≤ 3 doses of IR hydromorphone per day were required) was attained by 73.8% of patients (298/404), of whom 70.1% (209/298) were stabilized with ≤ 2 titration steps. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) time to dose stabilization was 12.1 ± 5.7 days (range of 3 to 33 days). The mean ± SD final daily dose of ER hydromorphone was 63.4 ± 129.2 mg. The mean ± SD final daily dose of IR hydromorphone was 11.5 ± 36.4 mg, and the mean ± SD final number of daily doses of IR hydromorphone was 1.7 ± 1.3. Intent-to-treat and completer analysis demonstrated significant improvements in BPI ratings from prior opioid therapy to the end of ER hydromorphone therapy (P < 0.01 for all pairwise comparisons). Adverse events were consistent with those expected of an opioid agonist in such a patient group, affecting primarily the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems. This uncontrolled study delineates a regimen by which patients with chronic malignant or nonmalignant pain can be readily converted from prior opioid therapy and titrated to an appropriate maintenance dose of ER hydromorphone. Controlled longitudinal studies are required to further evaluate the use of ER hydromorphone in patients with discrete chronic malignant or nonmalignant pain conditions.

### Management of breakthrough pain in children with cancer [^bd6d7121]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Using the appropriate route of administration ("by the appropriate route")

The least invasive route of administration, often chosen by the child, should be used, thus making intramuscular administration obsolete. The oral route (or via nasogastric/percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube if applicable) is convenient, noninvasive, and usually preferred by children and their care providers. The IV administration of opioids may be feasible, especially when there is central access. PCA/NCA combined with a continuous background analgesic approach often provides excellent pain management. Alternatively, opioid analgesics can be administered subcutaneously in IV-equivalent doses. Transdermal fentanyl patches are not usually indicated for acute pain management, due to their long onset time (it may take over 60 hours to reach peak concentrations in children), inability to rapidly titrate drug delivery, and long elimination half-life (up to 24 hours). In pediatric cancer pain, patches can be applied on intact, healthy skin every 48–72 hours, but they cannot be used with opioid-naïve children (ie, 30–60 mg oral morphine per 24 hours) for safe rotation to a fentanyl patch. The smallest patch delivers 12 μg/hour. A sufficient immediate-release breakthrough (rescue) opioid should also be provided. Transdermal fentanyl has a role in longer-lasting, stable acute pediatric pain. Transmucosal routes (ie, sublingual, buccal, intranasal) offer other options for route of administration, and these are discussed in greater detail.

### Symptom management in patients with lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^cb153fa4]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Lung cancer severe chronic cancer pain — opioid titration and breakthrough pain: In lung cancer patients with severe chronic cancer pain treated with systemic strong opioids, dose titration using either immediate release or sustained release oral morphine is suggested (Grade 2B). The recommended starting dose is oral morphine 30 mg/24 h in patients not previously treated with opioids, and 60 mg/24 h in those already taking an opioid at step 2 of the WHO ladder; where immediate release oral morphine is used, the four-hourly dose is used to treat episodes of uncontrolled pain and in this context may be used up to hourly, and where sustained release morphine is used, the total estimated daily dose is prescribed as once-daily or twice-daily oral morphine. In lung cancer patients with severe chronic cancer pain treated with systemic strong opioids who experience breakthrough pain, parenteral morphine or transmucosal fentanyl citrate are recommended (Grade 1B); oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, fentanyl buccal tablet and transnasal fentanyl spray are all effective formulations for breakthrough pain, and in patients with severe chronic cancer pain who experience a lack of effective analgesia, or uncontrollable side effects, or both, it is appropriate to switch to an alternative strong opioid, or route of administration, or both, though evidence of benefit from this approach is lacking.

2.3 Initial Dosage

Patients Not Currently on a Tramadol Product

The initial dose of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets is 100 mg once daily.

Patients Currently on Tramadol Immediate-Release (IR) Products

Calculate the 24-hour tramadol IR dose and initiate a total daily dose of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets rounded down to the next lower 100 mg increment. The dose may subsequently be individualized according to patient need.

Due to limitations in flexibility of dose selection with tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets, some patients maintained on tramadol IR products may not be able to convert to tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets.

Conversion from Other Opioids to Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets

Discontinue all other around-the-clock opioid drugs when tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy is initiated. There are no established conversion ratios for conversion from other opioids to tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets defined by clinical trials. Initiate dosing using tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets 100 mg once a day.

2.4 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy

Individually titrate tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets by 100 mg every five days to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. The maximum daily dose of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets is 300 mg per day.

### Transmucosal fentanyl vs intravenous morphine in doses proportional to basal opioid regimen for episodic-breakthrough pain [^c36fe24e]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic cancer pain often report wide fluctuations in pain intensity. In the cancer population, breakthrough pain (or episodic pain) is a transitory flare of pain superimposed on an otherwise stable pain pattern in patients treated with opioids. The availability of supplemental doses of opioids (rescue medication) in addition to the continuous analgesic medication is the main treatment suggested to manage these pain flares. Current dosing recommendations for breakthrough pain generally suggest that the effective dose of breakthrough pain medication must be a percentage of a patient's total daily opioid dose. These recommendations, which are based entirely on anecdotal experience, favour the selection of a short-acting opioid at a dose proportionate to the total daily dose. However, an oral dose form can take a longer time to relieve pain. As pain relief is usually required urgently, routes of administration designed to deliver drugs rapidly are often chosen. A short onset of effect is commonly obtainable only with parenteral or transmucosal administration of opioid analgesics.

Intravenous morphine (IV-MO) has been found to be highly effective and safe, as only a low intensity of opioid-induced adverse effects was observed, even when administering large doses. While the intravenous route for morphine administration is feasible in acute units, in some other centres is not favourite, and at home injections are not easily manageable.

On the other hand, studies of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) have shown that this approach produces a faster onset of relief and a greater degree of pain relief than the oral morphine, at 15, 30, and 60 min. A lack of relationship between the effective OTFC dose and the fixed schedule opioid regimen, regardless of the opioid used, was observed suggesting the need to titrate the dose of OTFC. This observation contradicted the anecdotal assumption that the effective dose as needed is a percentage of the opioid daily dose. The reasons for the above finding have not been clearly explained. This makes the practical use of OTFC in the raw clinical setting, or at home, difficult. Moreover, using different pieces of OTFC for treating each episode may be time consuming exceeding the spontaneous duration for breakthrough pain, which can spontaneously subside, as evidenced by placebo-treated patients.

### Morphine sulfate (Kadian) [^94935caa]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

The following dosing recommendations, therefore, can only be considered
suggested approaches to what is actually a series of clinical decisions over
time in the management of the pain of an individual patient.

Patients on other oral morphine formulations may be converted to
KADIAN®by administering one-half of the patient's total
daily oral morphine dose as KADIAN®capsules every 12
hours (twice-a-day) or by administering the total daily oral morphine dose as
KADIAN®capsules every 24 hours (once-a-day). KADIAN®should not be given more frequently than every 12
hours.

KADIAN®can be administered to patients
previously receiving treatment with parenteral morphine or other opioids. While
there are useful tables of oral and parenteral equivalents in cancer analgesia,
there is substantial interpatient variation in the relative potency of different
opioid drugs and formulations. For these reasons, it is better to underestimate
the patient's 24-hour oral morphine requirement and provide rescue medication,
than to overestimate and manage an adverse event. The following general points
should be considered:

Parenteral to Oral Morphine Ratio: It may take anywhere from 2–6 mg of oral
morphine to provide analgesia equivalent to 1 mg of parenteral morphine. A dose
of oral morphine three times the daily parenteral morphine requirement may be
sufficient in chronic use settings.
Other Parenteral or Oral Opioids to Oral Morphine Sulfate: There is lack of
systematic evidence bearing on these types of analgesic substitutions.
Therefore, specific recommendations are not possible. Physicians are advised to
refer to published relative potency data, keeping in mind that such ratios are
only approximate. In general, it is safest to give half of the estimated daily
morphine demand as the initial dose, and to manage inadequate analgesia by
supplementation with immediate-release morphine. (See discussion which follows.)

Literature review and analysis. 42In a 2016 review of oral morphine, the results from 17 studies indicated that 96% of morphine-treated patients achieved the outcome of no worse than mild pain. 42A 2016 review of oral morphine for cancer pain reported that 7% of patients discontinued morphine due to adverse events. 43 Clinical interpretation. 73-75Opioids are usually initiated during a short course of an immediate-release formulation as needed to establish the effective dose. In the setting of stable pain, the effective dose can often be determined within a few days. The US Food and Drug Administration also recommends this practice of as-needed immediate-release opioids before starting regularly scheduled opioids.

76Once the effective dose has been determined, extended-release opioids are considered. Extended-release opioids can be administered by mouth every 12 or 24 hours, or transdermal every 72 hours or every 7 days. The main advantage of these formulations is the need for much less frequent administration compared with immediate-release opioids, while their main disadvantage is higher cost and frequent insurance company denials or elevated copayments. Immediate-release opioids are inexpensive but they need to be administered every 4 hours to maintain stable blood levels and analgesia. This requires patients to wake up in the middle of the night to take an opioid dose.
77. Evidence regarding antiemetics or different routes of opioid administration was also limited.

In a 2018 RCT not included in the 2019 review, 120 patients with cancer without prior opioid use who started to receive oral oxycodone were randomly assigned to prophylactic prochlorperazine or placebo, three times daily for 5 days. Complete response occurred in 69. 5% of patients in the prochlorperazine arm and
63. 3% of patients in the placebo arm (. notnoninferior to morphine at 30 minutes. 60By contrast, a 2015 crossover trial of fentanyl buccal tablet versus oral morphine in 68 patients favored fentanyl for pain reduction at 30 minutes. 53 Clinical interpretation. 84.

### Multicenter, open-label, prospective evaluation of the conversion from previous opioid analgesics to extended-release hydromorphone hydrochloride administered every 24 hours to patients with persistent moderate to severe pain [^18dea2e6]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Hydromorphone hydrochloride is a mu-opioid agonist with dose-dependent analgesic properties. Extended-release hydromorphone hydrochloride (ER hydromorphone HCl) capsules have been developed for administration every 24 hours.

Objectives

This prospective evaluation focused on the first (ie, conversion) phase of 2 identically designed, randomized, controlled studies that compared the safety and efficacy of once-daily ER hydromorphone HCl capsules with immediate-release hydromorphone hydrochloride (IR hydromorphone HCl) tablets administered 4 times daily in the treatment of persistent moderate to severe cancer- and noncancer-related pain.

Methods

Patients being treated with opioid analgesics for persistent moderate to severe pain were converted to ER hydromorphone HCl using an 8:1 conversion ratio. The dose was titrated to attain an average pain intensity (API) score ≤ 4 on a 0- to 10-point numeric rating scale. Supplemental oral IR hydromorphone HCl tablets were used as rescue medication at a dose of one eighth to one sixth of the daily ER hydromorphone HCl dose.

Results

A total of 343 patients (272 [79%] with cancer pain; mean age, 57.8 years) were enrolled and converted to ER hydromorphone HCl from their previous opioids. About half (51%) were women. At baseline, the mean (SD) API score was 5.3 (2.1). Mean (SD) API scores were 4.7 (2.0) after the first 48 hours and 3.4 (2.1) by the end of titration. After 4 to 21 days of titration, 239 (70%) patients reached stabilization defined as a ≥ 48-hour period with an API score of ≤ 4, unchanged ER hydromorphone HCl dose, and ≤ 2 rescue doses per day. The stabilized patients had mean (SD) API scores of 2.7 (1.1) at the end of titration. At stabilization, 102 (43%) of 239 patients remained at their initial conversion dose, 129 (54%) had a dose increase, and 8 (3%) had a dose decrease. Frequent (≥ 10% of patients) adverse events that occurred within the first 48 hours after conversion and during the entire titration phase were nausea, somnolence, headache, constipation, vomiting, and dizziness.

Conclusion

In this prospective evaluation of the conversion and titration phase of 2 randomized, controlled studies, a conversion ratio of 8:1 mg of oral morphine to oral ER hydromorphone HCl was found to be clinically useful in patients with persistent moderate to severe cancer-related or noncancer-related pain.

### Repeat-dose steady-state pharmacokinetic evaluation of once-daily hydromorphone extended-release (OROS® hydromorphone ER) in patients with chronic pain [^da783b86]. Journal of Pain Research (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize the steady-state pharmacokinetic profile of hydromorphone extended-release (ER) in patients with chronic pain taking concomitant medications.

Methods

This open-label repeat-dose study enrolled 22 patients (mean age, 51.4 years; 81.8% female). All patients were receiving at least one concomitant medication; 86.4% were receiving at least two concomitant medications and 81.8% were receiving at least three. Patients receiving a stable dose of an opioid were converted to hydromorphone ER at a 5:1 ratio (morphine equivalent:hydromorphone). The dose was titrated to adequate analgesia over 3–14 days and stabilized between 8–48 mg. Oral morphine immediate-release was permitted for breakthrough pain. Area under the concentration-time curve from 0–24 hours (AUC(0–24)), maximum plasma concentration (C(max)), trough plasma concentration (C(min)), average plasma concentration (C(avg)), and degree of fluctuation (100 × [(C(max) - C(min)) ÷ C(avg)]) were calculated based on data from 14 patients.

Results

Dose-normalized to 16 mg, mean pharmacokinetic parameter values were: AUC(0–24), 41.1 ng · h/mL; C(max), 2.6 ng/mL; C(min), 1.1 ng/mL; C(avg), 1.7 ng/mL; and the degree of fluctuation was 99.6%. The pharmacokinetic profile of hydromorphone ER was linear and consistent with dose proportionality. Mean pain intensity difference scores showed statistically significant improvement from 2–21 hours after dosing. Sixteen (72.7%) patients reported at least one adverse event (AE). The most common were constipation (31.8%), headache (22.7%), and vomiting (13.6%). One patient discontinued treatment due to vomiting. No deaths, serious AEs, or unexpected AEs occurred.

Conclusion

These findings replicate and extend the steady-state pharmacokinetic profile of hydromorphone ER, previously characterized in healthy volunteers, to a population of chronic pain patients taking numerous concomitant medications.

### Opioids for the management of breakthrough (episodic) pain in cancer patients [^d4e8a446]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Breakthrough pain is a transient increase in pain intensity over background pain. It is a common and distinct component of cancer pain that can have a negative impact for both the patient and carers' quality of life. Breakthrough pain is usually related to background pain and is typically of rapid onset, severe in intensity, and generally self-limiting with an average duration of 30 minutes. At present the current approach to managing breakthrough pain is using supplemental analgesia (also known as rescue medication) at a dose proportional to the total around-the-clock (ATC) opioid dose.

Objectives

This review explores and assesses the evidence for the use of opioids in the management of breakthrough pain in patients with cancer.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE (1966 to 2005), EMBASE (1980 to 2005), CancerLit (1993 to 2005), CINAHL (1982 to 2005) and Cochrane databases were searched. Handsearching of medical journals and reference from key textbooks was undertaken and drug companies contacted for unpublished data. There was no language restriction. Date of most recent search: January 2005.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials of opioids used as rescue medication against active or placebo comparator in patients with cancer pain were included. Outcome measures sought were reduction in pain intensity measured by an appropriate scale, adverse effects, attrition, patient satisfaction and quality of life. There were no language restrictions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Eligible studies were selected and examined independently by the two reviewers. Full text was retrieved if any uncertainty about eligibility remained. Non-English texts were screened. Quality assessment and data extraction were conducted using standardised data forms. Drug and placebo dose, titration, route and formulation were compared and detail of all outcome measures (if available) recorded.

Main Results

Four studies (393 participants) met the inclusion criteria, all were concerned with the use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) in the management of breakthrough pain. Two studies examined the titration of OTFC, one study compared OTFC to normal release morphine and one study compared OTFC to placebo.OTFC was shown to be an effective treatment for breakthrough pain. When compared to placebo and morphine, participants gave lower pain intensity scores and higher pain relief scores for OTFC at all time points. Global assessment scores also favoured OTFC.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that OTFC is an effective treatment in the management of breakthrough pain. The randomised trial literature for the management of breakthrough pain is small and no trials were found for other opioids. Given the importance of this subject, more trials need to be undertaken.

### Dosing considerations with transdermal formulations of fentanyl and buprenorphine for the treatment of cancer pain [^78895c4d]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

The first step in conversion is to calculate the patient's 24-hour PO morphine usage (mg/day) and then apply the appropriate conversion ratio to determine the TD-O dose. When converting to TD-O pharmacotherapy, the patient is at increased risk of suffering significant breakthrough pain and opioid withdrawal. In order to reduce the chances of opioid withdrawal, patients should be prescribed an instant release (IR) opioid given on a regular schedule every 3 or 4 hours and not as needed (PRN) until the TD-O reaches therapeutic levels. Additionally, supplemental doses of IR opioid PRN for breakthrough pain relief should be given during initiation of TD-O therapy (first 18 hours for TD-Fe and first 48 hours for TD-Bu) followed by every 2–3 hours PRN therafter. During dosage titration of TD-Os, the practitioner should note the daily amount of the IR breakthrough pain medication utilized during the first 48–72 hours after beginning TD-O pharmacotherapy, and consider increasing the TD-O dose if clinically necessary. Moreover, TD-Os are long acting and can take 5–6 days to reach steady state serum concentrations. Steady state concentrations occur during the second patch application of TD-Fe when dosed every 3 days and during the first application of TD-Bu when given every 7 days.TD-Bu for cancer pain is dosed on two fixed days of the week (ie, Tuesday and Saturday).

### Transmucosal fentanyl vs intravenous morphine in doses proportional to basal opioid regimen for episodic-breakthrough pain [^3c194e35]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

From the practical point of view, in our daily activity, most patients have been reluctant to try the dose, either on in-patient or outpatient basis, and avoid using the OTFC, preferring, at the end, traditional oral dosing of morphine. The aim of this randomised, crossover, controlled study was to verify the safety and effectiveness of a fixed dose of OTFC, proportional to the daily dose, compared to the standard treatment available in the unit, which is IV-MO, used in a similar way for the management of breakthrough pain.

### Effectiveness and safety of once-daily extended-release hydrocodone in individuals previously receiving immediate-release oxycodone for chronic pain [^ec7c8e7b]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Patients who rotated to HYD treatment presented with moderate to severe levels of pain at baseline as assessed by a mean "average pain over the last 24 hours" score. HYD treatment was efficacious, as evidenced by a decrease in the mean score for "average pain over the last 24 hours" by the end of the dose titration period. The reduction in pain scores was sustained throughout the 52-week maintenance period, with a total decrease of 2.6 points in mean "average pain over the last 24 hours" scores over the duration of the study. This greater than 2 point decrease in pain scores with HYD treatment exceeded the criteria for a minimum clinically important difference and led to stable analgesia over a 52-week maintenance period. Additionally, patients reported lower pain severity and interference during the maintenance period, demonstrating that treatment with HYD was associated with clinically important pain relief (≥ 1 point decrease) and functional improvements in the daily activities of patients. Furthermore, analgesia provided by HYD was stable throughout the 24-hour dosing interval as evidenced by mean "pain right now" scores that were similar at dosing, at 12 hours postdose, and over the 24-hour duration. Collectively, these data indicate that, among patients switching from oxycodone who continued to receive treatment during the 52-week period, once-daily HYD provided pain relief that was sustained over the 24-hour dosing interval, maintained over a 52-week period, and associated with functional improvements in daily living.

Importantly, opioid tolerance, a phenomenon reported with long-term opioid treatment when a particular dose fails over time to provide acceptable analgesia, thus necessitating dose escalation, was not observed with HYD in this subanalysis. The majority of patients receiving HYD did not require dose adjustments during the maintenance period, while some patients were switched to a lower HYD dose and a dose increase of one or two levels was necessary in some patients. Only four patients (5%) discontinued due to lack of therapeutic effect. The mean daily dose of HYD administered during the maintenance period remained consistent. Notably, the use of supplemental opioid analgesics decreased from baseline levels to the end of the titration period, and this reduction persisted during the maintenance period. Finally, a survey of the 77% of patients who entered the maintenance period indicated that all patients found HYD convenient to use, while most patients were satisfied with the pain management of HYD.

### Tramadol hydrochloride [^9d30c71e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose

Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with tramadol hydrochloride extended release tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Patient Counseling Information (17)].

Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program).

Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3, 5.7)].

Consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose.

2.3 Initial Dosage

Patients Not Currently on a Tramadol Product

The initial dose of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets is 100 mg once daily.

Patients Currently on Tramadol Immediate-Release (IR) Products

Calculate the 24-hour tramadol IR dose and initiate a total daily dose of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets rounded down to the next lower 100 mg increment. The dose may subsequently be individualized according to patient need.

Due to limitations in flexibility of dose selection with tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets, some patients maintained on tramadol IR products may not be able to convert to tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets.

Conversion from Other Opioids to Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets

When tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy is initiated, discontinue all other opioid analgesics other than those used on an as needed basis for breakthrough pain when appropriate drugs.

### Safety and effectiveness of intravenous morphine for episodic (breakthrough) pain using a fixed ratio with the oral daily morphine dose [^d00c8728]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2004). Low credibility.

Breakthrough pain is normally severe in intensity and has a rapid onset. The availability of supplemental doses of opioids (rescue medication) in addition to the continuous analgesic medication is the main treatment suggested to manage these pain flares. The intravenous (i.v.) route may provide analgesia fast enough, but has never been assessed in clinical studies. The aim of this open-label study was to verify the safety and effectiveness of an i.v. dose equal to one-fifth the calculated equianalgesic total daily dose in advanced cancer patients with episodic pain. A consecutive sample of 48 cancer patients treated with oral morphine, who reported an acceptable basal analgesia and reported episodic pains, were selected for the study. The intravenous dose of morphine was one-fifth of the oral daily dose, converted into an i.v. dose using an equianalgesic ratio of 1/3 (i.v./oral). Written orders were given and intravenous morphine (i.v.-M) was administered by nurses. For each episode, pain intensity and opioid-related symptoms were recorded at the start (T0), after achieving maximum pain relief (T1), and one hour after (T2). In five patients, blood samples were taken at the time intervals described for measuring plasma concentrations of morphine and related glucuronated metabolites. One hundred seventy-one breakthrough pains were recorded during admission. In 162 episodes, a reduction of pain intensity of more than 33% was obtained within a mean of 17.7 minutes, from a mean intensity of 7.9 (on a 0–10 numeric scale) to 3. One hundred thirty-six episodes had more than a 50% pain intensity decrease after the i.v.-M within a mean of 16.6 minutes, from a pain intensity of 7.9 to 2.6. No differences in age, sex, pain mechanism, and time of events were found. There was a trend but no statistically significant differences between the groups receiving different basal doses and time to reach the maximum effect. Twenty episodes in ten patients required an additional dose within 2 hours. Adverse effects were uncommon and were significantly related to the basal dose, and as a consequence, with the i.v.-M dose. Morphine concentration significantly increased at the time of pain intensity reduction, and then decreased. These observations suggest that i.v.-M at a dose equivalent to 20% of the basal oral dosage is safe and effective in the majority of patients experiencing pain exacerbation. This treatment is inexpensive and can be used at little risk to patients.

### Use of immediate-release opioids as supplemental analgesia during management of moderate-to-severe chronic pain with buprenorphine transdermal system [^ac498ce2]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Breakthrough pain, usually presenting as incident pain or episodic pain, describes exacerbations of pain occurring in the background of adequately managed chronic pain. Incorporating principles of the multimodal approach to pain management, it is common to manage breakthrough pain utilizing nonopioid or combination IR opioid–nonopioid products for supplemental analgesia. As a balanced approach to pain management for some patients with chronic pain, IR opioids may be used to supplement ER/LA-opioid therapy. However, there is limited guidance and discussion on optimal treatment strategies for add-on therapy of IR opioids to ER/LA-opioid therapy to treat breakthrough pain. The objective of this post hoc analysis is to describe the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the BTDS when used concomitantly with IR opioids as supplemental analgesia during the management of moderate–severe chronic pain.

### Hydromorphone hydrochloride [^c4cb07f2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy

Individually titrate hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.13)]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During use of opioid therapy for an extended period of time, periodically reassess the continued need for opioid analgesics.

If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.

Plasma levels of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are sustained for 18 to 24 hours. Dosage adjustments of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may be made in increments of 4 to 8 mg every 3 to 4 days as needed to achieve adequate analgesia.

Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dose increase of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate-release analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dose stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose.

If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, the subsequent doses may be reduced. Adjust the dose to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate [^60ef48d2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

There is inter-patient variability in the relative potency of opioid drugs and formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour oral hydrocodone dosage and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate-release opioid) than to overestimate the 24-hour oral hydrocodone dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to an overdose.

In a hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets clinical trial with an open-label titration period, patients were converted from their prior opioid to hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets using Table 1 as a guide for the initial hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets dose. To obtain the initial hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets dose, first use Table 1 to convert the prior oral opioids to a total hydrocodone daily dose and then reduce the calculated daily hydrocodone dose by 25% to account for interpatient variability in relative potency of different opioids.

Consider the following when using the information found in Table 1.

This is not a table of equianalgesic doses.
The conversion factors in this table are only for the conversion from one of the listed oral opioid analgesics to hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets.
The table cannot be used to convert from hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets to another opioid. Doing so will result in an over-estimation of the dose of the new opioid and may result in fatal overdose.

### Advances in opioid therapy and formulations [^4ec0fb10]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Newly developed opioid analgesics and drug delivery systems may provide pain relief for patients intolerant of morphine. Long-acting oral opioids supply satisfactory analgesia at more convenient dosing intervals. Implantable pumps can provide full analgesic doses of opioids both subcutaneously and intrathecally over extended time periods. Optimal opioid use should rely on individualized dose-finding approaches to enhance pain relief while limiting drug-related side effects and avoiding the common problems associated with opioid prescription in clinical practice.

### Use of immediate-release opioids as supplemental analgesia during management of moderate-to-severe chronic pain with buprenorphine transdermal system [^b955ba6c]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pain conditions affect approximately 100 million adults in the US. The US Food and Drug Administration guidance has noted that prescription opioids are an important component of modern pain management. Opioid medications can be classified as immediate-release (IR) or extended-release (ER)/long-acting (LA) opioid formulations on the basis of their duration of action. Usually, IR opioids are short-acting, intended for use every 3–6 hours, and are more appropriate for transient pain types, such as acute, breakthrough, or intermittent pain. Common IR opioids (eg, morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, codeine, fentanyl, tramadol, tapentadol, oxycodone, and hydrocodone) may be available as single entity or in combination with acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Due to associated risks of hepatic and gastrointestinal toxicity with acetaminophen or NSAIDs, the maximum daily amount of these combination therapies may be limited. On the other hand, ER/LA opioids have a prolonged half-life and deliver a dose over a longer period of time (greater than 8 hours), which makes them appropriate for patients with persistent chronic pain that requires stable, around-the-clock dosing. Generally, ER/LA opioids are intended to result in less frequent administration than IR-opioid formulations.

Buprenorphine hydrochloride was introduced in the US for pain management in a parenteral form in 1981. Transdermal formulations for pain management were launched in Europe in 2001, which led to renewed interest in the use of buprenorphine to treat cancer pain and chronic nonmalignant pain. In 2010, the buprenorphine transdermal system (BTDS; Butrans®, Purdue Pharma LP, Stamford, CT, US) was approved in the US for the management of chronic pain.–The BTDS is a transdermal patch that delivers an average of 5, 7.5, 10, 15, or 20 μg/h of buprenorphine over 7 days. It is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. Several studies have demonstrated that the BTDS is effective, safe, and generally well tolerated among adults with moderate–severe chronic pain.–

### Morphine sulfate (Avinza) [^b47434fc]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Conversion from Parenteral Morphine or Other Non-Morphine Opioids (Parenteral or Oral) to AVINZA

There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dose of AVINZA. It is better to underestimate a patient's 24-hour oral morphine dose and make available rescue medication than to overestimate the 24-hour oral morphine dose and manage an adverse experience or overdose. The following general points should be considered regarding opioid conversions.

Parenteral to oral morphine ratio: Anywhere from 3 to 6 mg of oral morphine may be required to provide pain relief equivalent to 1 mg of parenteral morphine. Based on this rationale, a reasonable starting dose of AVINZA would be approximately three times the previous daily parenteral morphine requirement.

Other parenteral or oral non-morphine opioids to oral morphine sulfate: Physicians and other healthcare professionals are advised to refer to published relative potency information, keeping in mind that conversion ratios are only approximate. In general, it is safest to administer half of the estimated daily morphine requirement as the initial AVINZA dose once per day and then manage insufficient pain relief by supplementation with immediate-release morphine or other short-acting analgesics. (see Individualization of Dosage)

### Symptom management in patients with lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^e159611f]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Breakthrough cancer pain management — short-acting opioid dosing, transmucosal fentanyl options, and pharmacokinetics are detailed. Breakthrough pain is conventionally managed by prescribing as-required short-acting strong opioid in a dose equivalent to one-sixth of the daily ATC opioid dose, and the ATC dose is titrated by totaling the breakthrough doses administered in the preceding 24 h and adding all or a proportion of this dose to the ATC dose for the following day. Immediate-release oral morphine has a time to peak effect of 20–30 min and a plasma elimination half-life of 2.2 h, and an ideal agent would reach peak effect after 1 to 2 min and last 30 to 60 min. Transmucosal fentanyl formulations include oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC), fentanyl buccal tablet (FBT), and intranasal fentanyl spray (INFS); OTFC has approximately 25% absorbed through the mucosa and a further 25% via the GI tract, FBT has approximately 48% absorbed via the buccal mucosa, and INFS has approximate bioavailability of 90%. Time to maximum plasma concentration is OTFC, 91 min; FBT, 47 min; INFS, 13 min. In a systematic review, eight studies described transmucosal and parenteral opioids for breakthrough cancer pain, transmucosal fentanyl preparations appeared safe, tolerable, and effective when titrated, most studies found no relationship between ATC dose and rescue opioid dose, and there was no evidence to support the superiority of one transmucosal fentanyl preparation over another.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^8e76590a]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinicians should not treat acute pain with ER/LA opioids or initiate opioid treatment for subacute or chronic pain with ER/LA opioids, and clinicians should not prescribe ER/LA opioids for intermittent use. Because of the longer half-life and longer duration of effects (e.g. respiratory depression) of ER/LA opioids (e.g. methadone, fentanyl patches, or extended-release versions of oxycodone, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, or morphine), clinicians should not prescribe ER/LA opioids for the treatment of acute pain. ER/LA opioids should be reserved for severe, continuous pain and should be considered only for patients who have received certain dosages of immediate-release opioids daily (e.g. 60 mg daily of oral morphine, 30 mg daily of oral oxycodone, or equianalgesic dosages of other opioids) for at least 1 week. When changing to an ER/LA opioid for a patient previously receiving a different immediate-release opioid, clinicians should consult product labeling and reduce total daily dosage to account for incomplete opioid cross-tolerance. Clinicians should use additional caution with ER/LA opioids and consider a longer dosing interval when prescribing to patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction because decreased clearance of medications among these patients can lead to accumulation of medications to toxic levels and persistence in the body for longer durations. Although in certain situations clinicians might need to prescribe immediate-release and ER/LA opioids together (e.g. when transitioning patients from ER/LA opioids to immediate-release opioids by temporarily using lower dosages of both, for temporary postoperative use of short-term opioids in a patient already receiving ER/LA opioids, or in patients with opioid use disorder treated and stabilized on methadone who need short-acting opioids for acute pain), clinicians should consider the potential for increased overdose risk and use caution when prescribing immediate-release opioids in combination with ER/LA opioids.

### Overdose deaths demand a new paradigm for opioid rotation [^7daf5b47]. Pain Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

An increasing number of deaths have been inferred to be associated with current opioid rotation practices and evidence is mounting that the use of widely accepted protocols for opioid rotation is an important contributing factor. Based on the findings of a literature review published in conjunction with this article, we propose a new paradigm for a potentially safer method of opioid rotation and present a case study illustrating the paradigm. This new paradigm suggests three easy-to-remember steps in opioid rotation and obviates the need to use a conversion table.

Design

Report of a clinical case of a patient undergoing opioid rotation using this new paradigm.

Summary

The patient was successfully rotated from extended-release oxycodone to extended-release hydromorphone. The dose of oxycodone was slowly decreased, while the hydromorphone dose was slowly titrated. A critical element to this approach involved providing sufficient immediate-release opioid to treat breakthrough pain and to reverse acute abstinence signs and symptoms if the dosing changes prove insufficient.

Conclusion

A safer new paradigm for opioid rotation may provide an important incremental step forward in reducing adverse public health consequences of inappropriate opioid dosing.

### Impact of opioid rescue medication for breakthrough pain on the efficacy and tolerability of long-acting opioids in patients with chronic non-malignant pain [^a330e2a6]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

All English, German, French, Spanish, or Italian language full-text research articles were eligible for inclusion, as long as they met the criteria defined below.

All published, prospective, blinded, or open-label clinical trials with either a randomized or controlled design were eligible. Prospective observational studies were also accepted. Case reports, conference proceedings, or retrospective studies (surveys or audits) were excluded from this review.

Eligible patients were adults aged ≥ 18 yr with chronic non-malignant pain (such as chronic musculoskeletal pain, vascular disorders, chronic pancreatitis, lower back pain, osteogenic pain, coronary artery disease, phantom limb pain, post-herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, or neuropathic pain). Studies that included patients with malignant pain were eligible only if less than one-third of the study population were patients with malignant pain. Studies in both opioid-naïve patients and patients already on opioids were eligible.

Treatments included in the review were long-acting opioids or opioid formulations [such as methadone, transdermal fentanyl, or sustained-release (SR) morphine] including the weak opioids, tramadol, codeine, and slow-release dihydrocodeine. All routes of administration, other than intrathecal or intraspinal, were eligible. Since intrathecal use of opioids is an invasive method often used as a last resort in a selection of patients unresponsive to other treatments, we felt that that patient group is not comparable with those receiving oral or transdermal opioids. All studies in which one or more opioids was administered for at least 4 weeks, including those that compared one opioid with placebo, other opioids, or other active controls were eligible for inclusion. Studies had to have a flexible dosing regimen (at least during the maintenance phase); studies with specific criteria for dose escalation or dose escalation to a maximum dose were eligible.

Whether an IR opioid was used as rescue medication or not had to be defined. If this information was not given explicitly in the publication, a single attempt was made to contact the authors to obtain this information before the study was excluded.

Studies reporting at least one of the following outcome measures were eligible.
A measure of analgesic efficacy, such as pain relief or pain intensity measured by the Brief Pain Inventory, a visual analogue scale, or equivalent, or patient and investigator global assessment of analgesic efficacy.
Tolerability: number or percentage of patients reporting either nausea, constipation, or somnolence/sedation (or drowsiness if somnolence/sedation not reported).

### A randomized, double-blind, multi-site, crossover, placebo-controlled equivalence study of morning versus evening once-daily sustained-release morphine sulfate in people with pain from advanced cancer [^d2218ebd]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2007). Low credibility.

Diurnal variation in pain perception is recognized. The question of whether opioid prescribing should be adjusted to account for diurnal variation can be tested with the advent of once-daily sustained-release morphine. The study recruited 45 people with opioid-responsive pain on stable doses of analgesics and advanced cancer from five regional palliative care programs in Australia. Each participant took one placebo and a 24-hourly dose of sustained-release morphine daily, 12 hours apart-active dose in the morning for one week and in the evening for the other week. The order of the weeks was randomized in a double-blind manner. The primary outcome from the last two days (steady state) on both arms was averaged four-hourly pain scores while awake on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes included VAS and categorical scales for other pain parameters, quality of sleep, nausea, vomiting, constipation, confusion, and somnolence. Twenty-six of 42 participants completed the study and provided adequate power for analysis. Mean VAS was 16 mm for morning dosing and 14 mm for evening dosing (P = 0.76, difference of adjusted means 2 mm, 95% confidence interval: -2, 6). No differences were found in pain control, pain during the day, pain disturbing sleep, or with breakthrough medication use. This study suggests that any difference between morning and evening dosing of once-daily sustained-release morphine in people with significant opioid-responsive pain and advanced cancer is small and unlikely to be clinically significant for most people.

### Effectiveness and safety of once-daily extended-release hydrocodone in individuals previously receiving immediate-release oxycodone for chronic pain [^8a62cf9c]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Statistical Analysis

All patients who received at least one dose of HYD during the study and who used IR oxycodone as their primary prestudy analgesic regimen were included in this post hoc analysis (i.e. the safety population). Mean pain intensity, as measured by the weekly mean "average pain over the last 24 hours" score, was summarized at baseline, at the end of the dose titration period, and weekly during the maintenance period. Changes from baseline in patients' pain severity and pain interference, as measured by patient responses to the BPI, were summarized by period (dose titration period and maintenance period). Associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the mean and the mean change from baseline for applicable variables. Safety evaluations, including AEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, and ECG findings, were previously summarized for the overall study.

Summary of nonopioid medications used for pain by ≥ 5% of patients prior to baseline for patients switching from IR oxycodone

A total of 75 patients (77%) achieved a stable HYD dose during the dose titration period and entered the maintenance period (Table 4). Of these patients, 42 (56%) completed the study and 33 (44%) discontinued treatment. The most common reason for treatment discontinuation during the overall treatment period was AEs (15 patients, 15%) (Table 4). Other common reasons for treatment discontinuation during the overall treatment period included patient's choice (11 patients, 11%), lack of therapeutic effect (eight patients, 8%), administrative reasons (eight patients, 8%), and loss to follow-up (seven patients, 7%). Three (3%) patients each discontinued treatment due to suspected or confirmed study drug diversion or did not qualify for the maintenance period.

### Patterns of immediate-release and extended-release opioid analgesic use in the management of chronic pain, 2003–2014 [^4806132c]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Our findings stimulate further research questions. Recent articles have attempted to shed light on risk factors associated with long-term opioid analgesic use. For example, one study found that patients filling greater initial quantities, durations, and doses of opioid analgesics had higher risks of long-term opioid analgesic use. However, this investigation did not account for the intended treatment duration when the opioid analgesic was initially prescribed. Longer-term treatment may have been intended in patients initially prescribed greater amounts of opioid analgesics owing to increased disease severities or comorbidities, therefore confounding the observed correlation. Efforts to elucidate predictors for the development of opioid use disorder, as well as medically unnecessary transitions from acute to chronic opioid analgesic therapy, will help improve policies regarding appropriate opioid analgesic use.

Other areas of future work include examining adding and switching patterns among individual opioid analgesic active moieties and products. Furthermore, better understanding changes in prescribed IR and ER/LA opioid analgesic doses over time, reasons for choosing one formulation over another, and the generalizability of these findings to all settings of care will help guide opioid analgesic policies. As part of multipronged efforts to understand and address the current opioid crisis in the United States, a clear understanding of how IR and ER/LA formulations continue to be used in long-term pain management may help optimize the risk-benefit balance of these therapies, particularly as nonopioid therapies for chronic pain are developed and approved.

### Oxycodone hydrochloride (Oxaydo) [^a816bc8d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In converting patients from other opioids to Oxycodone Hydrochloride Capsules, close observation and adjustment of dosage based upon the patient's response to OXAYDO is imperative. Administration of supplemental analgesia for breakthrough or incident pain and titration of the total daily dose of OXAYDO may be necessary, especially in patients who have disease states that are changing rapidly.

Conversion from Fixed-Ratio Oral Opioid/Non-Opioid Combinations

When converting patients from fixed-ratio opioid/non-opioid drug regimens to OXAYDO, determine whether or not to continue the non-opioid analgesic. Titrate the dose of OXAYDO in response to the level of analgesia and adverse reactions afforded by the dosing regimen regardless of whether the non-opioid is continued.

Conversion from Other Oral Opioid Therapy to OXAYDO

If a patient has been receiving opioid-containing medications prior to taking OXAYDO, factor the potency of the prior opioid relative to oxycodone into the selection of the total daily dose of oxycodone.

In converting patients from other opioids to OXAYDO, close observation and adjustment of dosage based upon the patient's response to OXAYDO is imperative.

Conversion from OXAYDO to Extended-Release Oxycodone

The relative bioavailability of OXAYDO compared to extended-release oxycodone is unknown, so conversion to extended-release tablets may lead to increased risk of excessive sedation and respiratory depression.

2.4 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy

Individually titrate OXAYDO to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving OXAYDO to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.14)]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration.

If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the dosage of OXAYDO. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after a dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.

### Feasibility study of rapid opioid rotation and titration [^5c84fb1e]. Pain Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Opioid guidelines recommend opioid rotation and switching for patients who do not achieve adequate pain relief or who experience intolerable adverse events (AEs) with their current opioid. However, specific recommendations and protocols for opioid rotation are lacking, making the practice time consuming and difficult for primary care physicians to accomplish independently or coordinate with a pain specialist.

Objectives

To assess the safety and feasibility of using 24-hour intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) to achieve rapid opioid rotation and titration (RORT).

Study Design

Open-label pilot study.

Setting

Hospital research center.

Methods

At admission, patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with treatment-refractory chronic pain who were taking morphine or oxycodone for ≥ 3 months and had pain scores ≥ 4 on a 10-point scale, underwent opioid rotation to oral oxymorphone extended release (ER). They also received IV-PCA oxymorphone for 24 hours as needed. At discharge, the participants were taking oral oxymorphone ER with oxymorphone immediate release (IR) as needed based on their total 24-hour oral plus IV-PCA oxymorphone use. During a 2-week follow-up, their oxymorphone usage was titrated as needed. Main outcome measures were AEs, Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), Brief Pain Inventory (0 = no pain/interference, 10 = worst pain/complete interference), treatment satisfaction, and change in oxymorphone dose.

Results

Twelve patients enrolled and completed the 24-hour IV-PCA; 10 completed the 2-week follow-up post-24-hour IV-PCA. PGIC status improved by 12 hours (odds ratio [OR], 0.19, 95% CI, 0.08–0.44; P < 0.001), and both PGIC status and activity scores improved by 24 hours (OR, 0.23, 95% CI, 0.09–0.55; P = 0.001; OR, 0.49, 95% CI, 0.25–0.96; P = 0.04, respectively) and 2 weeks (OR, 0.14, 95% CI, 0.04–0.46; P = 0.001; OR, 0.21, 95% CI, 0.06–0.72; P = 0.01) versus 6 hours. During the 24-hour IV-PCA time period, 6 of 10 patients accomplished ≥ 50% of their overall dose titration. At 2 weeks, 8 of 10 participants were Greatly Satisfied or Somewhat Satisfied with the overall RORT procedure. RORT was well tolerated, with no serious AEs.

Limitations

This was a pilot open-label study in a small number of participants. A larger randomized study with long-term follow-up and comparison to traditional protocols is necessary.

Conclusions

Preliminary data suggest that RORT can be performed safely and effectively by incorporating IV-PCA during the first 24 hours. Further investigations are needed to determine whether RORT can become an ambulatory treatment intervention in pain practice.

### Impact of opioid rescue medication for breakthrough pain on the efficacy and tolerability of long-acting opioids in patients with chronic non-malignant pain [^37af4941]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

Alternatively, it may be that the IR opioids used in these studies are not beneficial because their active effect does not coincide with the peak pain intensity of the breakthrough pain episode. This would be particularly important for unpredictable incident pain, which is not precipitated by a known trigger, and idiopathic or spontaneous pain, for which pre-emptive treatment with short-acting opioids is not possible. The onset of breakthrough pain in opioid-treated patients with chronic non-malignant pain is rapid and peaks within a median of 10 min, whereas the onset of action of most short-acting opioids is between 30 and 60 min. As a consequence, the use of ineffective short-acting opioids may increase their use and lead to needless escalation in the dose of long-acting opioids for baseline pain and associated side-effects, although there is no published literature on this topic to date. Newer rapid-onset formulations of short-acting opioids, including oral trans-mucosal fentanyl citrate and fentanyl buccal tablets, have been shown to be efficacious for the short-term treatment of breakthrough pain and well-tolerated among patients with both chronic non-malignant and malignant pain. These studies specifically looked at the short-term effects of these medications on breakthrough pain (up to 2 h after dosing) and did not address the impact of long-term use of short-acting opioids for breakthrough pain in addition to a long-acting opioid regimen on pain control. We were unable to find any studies in malignant pain that directly addressed the impact of short-acting opioid rescue medication use on the long-term analgesic efficacy of long-acting opioid regimens. This is not unexpected as malignant pain treatment is relatively short term and frequent dose adaptations are necessary owing to the increase in pain.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^3fdd4290]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making. Risks of opioid use, including risk for overdose and overdose death, increase continuously with dosage, and there is no single dosage threshold below which risks are eliminated. Therefore, the recommendation language emphasizes that clinicians should avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients rather than emphasizing a single specific numeric threshold. Further, these recommendations apply specifically to starting opioids or to increasing opioid dosages, and a different set of benefits and risks applies to reducing opioid dosages (see Recommendation 5).
When opioids are initiated for opioid-naïve patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage.
For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed based on the severity of pain and other clinical factors such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8).
The lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table). TABLE Morphine milligram equivalent doses for commonly prescribed opioids for pain management Sources: Adapted from Von Korff M, Saunders K, Ray GT, et al. Clin J Pain 2008;24:521–7 and Nielsen S, Degenhardt L, Hoban B, Gisev N. Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf 2016;25:733–7. Abbreviations: mcg/hr = microgram per hour; mg = milligram; MME = morphine milligram equivalent. * Multiply the dose for each opioid by the conversion factor to determine the dose in MMEs. For example, tablets containing hydrocodone 5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg taken four times a day would contain a total of 20 mg of hydrocodone daily, equivalent to 20 MME daily; extended-release tablets containing oxycodone 10 mg and taken twice a day would contain a total of 20 mg of oxycodone daily, equivalent to 30 MME daily. The following cautions should be noted: 1) All doses are in mg/day except for fentanyl, which is mcg/hr. 2) Equianalgesic dose conversions are only estimates and cannot account for individual variability in genetics and pharmacokinetics. 3) Do not use the calculated dose in MMEs to determine the doses to use when converting one opioid to another; when converting opioids, the new opioid is typically dosed at a substantially lower dose than the calculated MME dose to avoid overdose because of incomplete cross-tolerance and individual variability in opioid pharmacokinetics. 4) Use particular caution with methadone dose conversions because methadone has a long and variable half-life, and peak respiratory depressant effect occurs later and lasts longer than peak analgesic effect. 5) Use particular caution with transdermal fentanyl because it is dosed in mcg/hr instead of mg/day, and its absorption is affected by heat and other factors. 6) Buprenorphine products approved for the treatment of pain are not included in the table because of their partial µ -receptor agonist activity and resultant ceiling effects compared with full µ -receptor agonists. 7) These conversion factors should not be applied to dosage decisions related to the management of opioid use disorder. † Tapentadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tapentadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists. § Tramadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tramadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists.
If opioids are continued for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage and should generally avoid dosage increases when possible.
Many patients do not experience benefit in pain or function from increasing opioid dosages to ≥ 50 MME/day but are exposed to progressive increases in risk as dosage increases. Therefore, before increasing total opioid dosage to ≥ 50 MME/day, clinicians should pause and carefully reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks. If a decision is made to increase dosage, clinicians should use caution and increase dosage by the smallest practical amount. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.
Additional dosage increases beyond 50 MME/day are progressively more likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits for pain and function relative to risks to patients as dosage increases further. Clinicians should carefully evaluate a decision to further increase dosage on the basis of individualized assessment of benefits and risks and weighing factors such as diagnosis, incremental benefits for pain and function relative to risks with previous dosage increases, other treatments and effectiveness, and patient values and preferences. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.

Short-acting oxymorphone — available as 5 or 10 mg tablets and 1mg/ml solution for injection — has initial oral dosage (in opioid-naïve) of 5 to 10 mg every 4 to 6 hr, and there is no optimal or maximum dose of oxymorphone; patients on LOT are likely to become tolerant and require doses higher than the usual dosage range to maintain the desired effect. Timing includes Analgesic Onset (min): 30 to 45 and Duration (hr): 4. In special populations, Elderly or debilitated: Use with caution and start at low end of dosing range; levels are increased 40% in patients ≥ 65 years. Food effects note: when taken orally with a high-fat meal, peak levels of oxymorphone immediate-release are 38 to 50% greater; it must be taken on an empty stomach at least 1 hr before or 2 hr after a meal.

Morphine controlled-release/sustained-release (CR/SR) and extended-release (ER) formulations — availability and initial dosing: Available CR/SR tablet strengths include 15, 30, 60, 100, and 200 mg for every 8 to 12 hr administration, and morphine ER capsules are available in 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75, 80, 90, 100, 120, and 200 mg for once daily administration. For opioid-naïve patients, Morphine CR or SR 15 mg every 8 to 12 hr is listed, with total daily increments of < 30 to 40 mg/d that may be made every 2 days. Morphine ER capsules are not indicated in opioid-naïve patients. For patients who are not opioid tolerant, start morphine ER at 30 mg daily and may adjust every 1 to 2 days.

### Transmucosal fentanyl vs intravenous morphine in doses proportional to basal opioid regimen for episodic-breakthrough pain [^974b6749]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was not to compare effective titrated doses with doses proportional to the scheduled daily doses, but two fast methods for treating breakthrough pain were compared, using a similar approach that is providing opioids at a dose proportional to the basal regimen.

Some issues gathered by these previous studies should be pointed out. As 66% of the episodes treated with placebo did not require an additional dose of medication, the episodes recorded were possibly short-lived or not too much severe, and possibly spontaneously resolved. This can also explain why minimal doses of oral morphine equivalents (about 20 mg) were effective in patients taking a mean basal dose of 100 μ g per hour of fentanyl (about 240 mg daily of oral morphine doses equivalents). Eligible patients were defined as having their basal pain no more than moderate, and presenting no more than four episodes per day. On the other hand, some patients could not be universally considered (mean intensity of 4.7–4.8 of basal pain, with some patients at the highest extremes) as having well-controlled pain, especially if matched with a pain intensity of breakthrough events of 6.8 on average (with some patients at the lowest extremes). No distinction was made between incident pain, dependent on activity, and other mechanisms, which can have a different temporal pattern. Finally, almost no adverse effects were reported with usual breakthrough medication in comparison with OTFC, which doses were titrated in patients apparently responsive to their usual medication, suggesting that probably most patients were undertreated either with basal or 'as needed' medication.

### Hydromorphone hydrochloride [^ab1b419b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets were investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study in opioid tolerant patients with moderate-to-severe low back pain. Patients were considered opioid tolerant if they were currently on opioid therapy that was ≥ 60 mg/day of oral morphine equivalent for at least 2 months prior to screening. Patients entered an open-label conversion and titration phase with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, were converted to a starting dose that was approximately 75% of their total daily morphine equivalent dose, and were dosed once daily until adequate pain control was achieved while exhibiting tolerable side effects. Supplemental immediate-release hydromorphone tablets were allowed throughout the study. Patients who achieved a stable dose entered a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized treatment phase. Mean daily dose at randomization was 37.8 mg/day (range of 12 mg/day to 64 mg/day). Fifty-eight (58) percent of patients were successfully titrated to a stable dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets during the open-label conversion and titration phase.

During the double-blind treatment phase, patients randomized to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets continued with the stable dose achieved in the conversion and titration phase of the study. Patients randomized to placebo received, in a blinded manner, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and matching placebo in doses tapering from the stable dose achieved in conversion and titration. During the taper down period, patients were allowed immediate-release hydromorphone tablets as supplemental analgesia to minimize opioid withdrawal symptoms in placebo patients. After the taper period, the number of immediate-release hydromorphone tablets was limited to two tablets per day. Forty-nine (49) percent of patients treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and 33% of patients treated with placebo completed the 12-week treatment period.

Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets provided superior analgesia compared to placebo. There was a significant difference between the mean changes from Baseline to Week 12 or Final Visit in average weekly pain intensity Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores obtained from patient diaries between the two groups. The proportion of patients with various degrees of improvement from screening to Week 12 or Final Visit is shown in Figure 2. For this analysis, patients who discontinued treatment for any reason prior to Week 12 were assigned a value of zero improvement.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^5a04481a]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

Clinicians should not treat acute pain with ER/LA opioids or initiate opioid treatment for subacute or chronic pain with ER/LA opioids, and clinicians should not prescribe ER/LA opioids for intermittent or as-needed use.
ER/LA opioids should be reserved for severe, continuous pain. FDA has noted that some ER/LA opioids should be considered only for patients who have received certain dosages of opioids of immediate-release opioids daily for at least 1 week.
When changing to an ER/LA opioid for a patient previously receiving a different immediate-release opioid, clinicians should consult product labeling and reduce total daily dosage to account for incomplete opioid cross-tolerance.
Clinicians should use additional caution with ER/LA opioids and consider a longer dosing interval when prescribing to patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction because decreased clearance of medications among these patients can lead to accumulation of drugs to toxic levels and persistence in the body for longer durations.
Methadone should not be the first choice for an ER/LA opioid. Only clinicians who are familiar with methadone's unique risk profile and who are prepared to educate and closely monitor their patients, including assessing risk for QT prolongation and considering electrocardiographic monitoring, should consider prescribing methadone for pain.
Only clinicians who are familiar with the dosing and absorption properties of the ER/LA opioid transdermal fentanyl and are prepared to educate their patients about its use should consider prescribing it.

Supporting Rationale

ER/LA opioids include methadone, transdermal fentanyl, and extended-release versions of opioids such as oxycodone, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, and morphine. Clinical evidence reviews found that effects of opioids on short-term pain and function were generally consistent across duration of action (short- or long-acting) and opioid type (opioid agonist, partial agonist, or mixed mechanism [with mixed opioid and nonopioid mechanisms of action] agent), although five trials directly comparing different types of opioids found a mixed mechanism agent associated with greater pain relief versus a pure opioid agonist, with fewer nonserious adverse events. A fair-quality study demonstrated a higher risk for overdose among patients treated with ER/LA opioids than among those treated with immediate-release opioids, especially within the first 2 weeks of therapy, with relative risk decreasing with longer duration of exposure. Clinical evidence reviews did not find evidence that continuous, time-scheduled use of ER/LA opioids is more effective or safer than intermittent use of immediate-release opioids or that time-scheduled use of ER/ LA opioids reduces risk for opioid use disorder.

### Oxymorphone hydrochloride (Opana) [^d4dab7ae]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Selection of patients for treatment with OPANA should be governed by the same principles that apply to the use of similar opioid analgesics [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Physicians should individualize treatment in every case [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)], using non-opioid analgesics, opioids on an as needed basis, combination products, and chronic opioid therapy in a progressive plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the American Pain Society.

OPANA should be administered on an empty stomach, at least one hour prior to or two hours after eating [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]

2.1 Individualization of Dosage

As with any opioid drug product, it is necessary to adjust the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's prior analgesic treatment experience. In the selection of the initial dose of OPANA, attention should be given to the following:

The total daily dose, potency and specific characteristics of the opioid the patient has been taking previously;
The relative potency estimate used to calculate the equivalent oxymorphone dose needed;
The patient's degree of opioid tolerance;
The age, general condition, and medical status of the patient;
Concurrent non-opioid analgesics and other medications;
The type and severity of the patient's pain;
The balance between pain control and adverse experiences;
Risk factors for abuse or addiction, including a prior history of abuse or addiction.

Once therapy is initiated, frequently assess pain relief and other opioid effects. Titrate dose to adequate pain relief (generally mild or no pain). Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment.

If signs of excessive opioid-related adverse experiences are observed, the next dose may be reduced. Adjust dosing to obtain an appropriate balance between pain relief and opioid-related adverse experiences. If significant adverse events occur before the therapeutic goal of mild or no pain is achieved, the events should be treated aggressively. Once adverse events are adequately managed, continue upward titration to an acceptable level of pain control.

During periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration, frequent contact is recommended between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family. Advise patients and family members of the potential common adverse reactions associated with changing opioid doses.

The dosing recommendations below, therefore, can only be considered as suggested approaches to what is actually a series of clinical decisions over time in the management of the pain of each individual patient.

### Real-world utilization of once-daily extended-release abuse deterrent formulation of hydrocodone: a comparison with the pre-approval randomized clinical trials [^29b4ee58]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In real-world use, HYD dosing corresponded very closely to the approved label of HYD administered orally once daily (every 24 hours) with a DACON of 1.04 pills/day. Patients on HYD maintained a stable dose of ~60 mg/day across all three studies. Rescue opioid use, while common, showed a consistent decreasing trend, which is reflected in a decrease in total opioid dose over time among patients treated with HYD. In totality, there is remarkable consistency across the controlled and the open-label registration trials as well as the real-world claim studies in HYD utilization.

In this double-blind, parallel-group study, we compared 3 oxymorphone immediate-release (IR) doses with placebo for efficacy and with oxycodone IR and placebo for safety in patients with acute moderate-to-severe postsurgical pain. During the single-dose phase (n = 300), patients received oxymorphone IR 10, 20, or 30 mg; oxycodone IR 10 mg; or placebo. All oxymorphone IR doses were superior for providing pain relief for 8 h (P < 0.05), with a significant analgesic dose response (P < 0.001). Significant pain intensity differences occurred by 45 min (20- and 30-mg doses; P < 0.05). Discontinuations for lack of efficacy totaled 42% among placebo-treated patients and 27% among those treated with oxymorphone IR. Patients requiring rescue medication after 3 h were allowed to receive additional study drug every 4 to 6 h as needed for the multiple-dose phase (n = 164). All oxymorphone groups maintained analgesia for 48 h. The median dosing interval was > 9.5 h for oxymorphone IR 30 mg and ≥ 7 h for the other groups. Opioid-related adverse events, similar among groups, were generally mild or moderate. Oxymorphone IR 10, 20, or 30 mg provided significant dose-related pain relief compared with placebo, and this relief was maintained over several days with a safety profile comparable to that of oxycodone IR.

### WHO guidelines for the pharmacological and radiotherapeutic management of cancer pain in adults and adolescents [^4f60b64d]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for palliative care in patients with cancer, more specifically with respect to management of pain, opioids, WHO 2018 guidelines recommend to offer regularly-dosed immediate-release oral morphine or regularly-dosed slow-release morphine to maintain effective and safe pain relief whenever oral dosing is possible. Offer immediate-release oral morphine as rescue medication with either formulation.

### Long-and short-acting opioids in cancer pain management: what is the best ratio? [^e50e91cd]. ASCO (2014). Low credibility.

Abstract 206 Background: Many cancer patients experience chronic and breakthrough pain necessitating the use of both immediate release and extended release opioids. The common strategy in treating chronic cancer pain is using ER opioids with the addition of IR opioids for breakthrough pain. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends IR dosing at 0. 1–0. 2 times the daily ER dose as needed every 1 hour for breakthrough pain, though data is lacking to validate this recommendation. The aim of this exploratory study was to review the current practice in prescribing IR and ER opioids and the IR/ER ratio used in cancer pain management at one comprehensive cancer center. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of 54 consecutive patients at a CCC over a 6 month period. IR/ER doses, dose adjustments and satisfaction with analgesia were recorded.

Adjustments in treatment plans were made based on patients' report of effectiveness and side effects associated with ER and IR opioids. Results: 19 of 54 patients reported adequate analgesia, with the average daily prescribed IR/ER ratio of 0.
6. In this group, IR opioids were unchanged during the clinic visit. The ER opioids, on average, were also unchanged, though decreased by 25% and increased by 50% in a few cases over serial clinic visits. Of those patients reporting suboptimal analgesia during the clinic visit, 80% had their ER opioids increased, 6% had IR opioids increased, and 9% had both IR and ER increased. The ER opioids were increased by 40% on average and IR by 11% with the average IR/ER ratio changing from 0. 5 to 0.
37. **Conclusions**: These preliminary data highlight the great variability between patient preferences and clinician decisions in terms of IR/ER opioid ratios.

In this retrospective study, analgesia was better in the group using higher IR doses with a higher IR/ER ratio. At the same time, patients with suboptimal analgesia had their ER opioids titrated faster and higher than the IR opioids. More studies are needed to determine best practice in the prescribing of long and short acting opioids for management of chronic cancer pain.
