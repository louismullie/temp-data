## Question

i am in haifa now. i plan to get pregnant soon and i heard they do recommended genetic screening here for some conditions that are more common in israel. is it required or can i skip them? or which are the most important ones?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether preconception or prenatal genetic carrier screening is required in Israel, which conditions are most important to prioritize, and whether it is reasonable to skip screening. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between mandatory versus recommended screening in Israel. Then, I should verify which conditions are included in the national program and which are considered high-yield additions. Next, I will review professional guidelines to weigh benefits, limitations, and timing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized recommendation and clarify what to do if you decline screening, making sure I anchor this in current Israeli data and international guidance.

> Let me first confirm the legal status, because I should not conflate "recommended" with "required". In Israel, newborn screening is mandatory, but preconception or prenatal carrier screening is not legally mandated; instead, there is a national, publicly funded carrier screening program that is strongly encouraged and widely accessed, with uptake around 85% in some cohorts, which signals strong endorsement rather than compulsion [^e51f1036] [^2b7b2616].

> Next, I should review what the national program actually covers. The Israeli Ministry of Health funds a basic panel that includes cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy, and fragile X syndrome, with adjustments for population-specific frequencies; many Health Maintenance Organizations extend coverage to additional conditions, and expanded panels are commercially available, reflecting Israel's diverse ancestry and founder effects [^2b7b2616] [^cbbbd6ac].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about which conditions are "most important" without anchoring to prevalence and impact. I need to check the carrier frequencies in Israel to prioritize. The highest-yield conditions on expanded Israeli panels include GJB2/GJB6 (connexin-related deafness) at roughly 1 in 22, CFTR (cystic fibrosis) around 1 in 28, GBA (Gaucher disease) near 1 in 34, TYR (oculocutaneous albinism) around 1 in 39, PAH (phenylketonuria) near 1 in 50, SMN1 (spinal muscular atrophy) around 1 in 52, and HEXA (Tay-Sachs) near 1 in 56; importantly, nearly half of at-risk couples identified by a curated Israeli expanded panel would be missed by ethnicity-limited testing, underscoring the value of a broader, population-tailored approach [^c1793eca].

> I should confirm how professional guidelines frame this. ACOG and ACMG recommend that all patients considering pregnancy be offered carrier screening for cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy, and that expanded carrier screening be made available as an alternative to ethnicity-based screening; NSGC supports offering expanded carrier screening to all reproductive-aged individuals after informed consent, with the greatest benefit when done preconception, which aligns with the Israeli model of early access and counseling [^5ae1a912] [^dc106a95] [^41fafdd0].

> Let me consider timing and logistics, because that affects actionability. Preconception screening is preferred so couples have the full range of reproductive options, including preimplantation genetic testing, donor gametes, or choosing not to conceive; if screening occurs during pregnancy, concurrent testing of both partners is reasonable when decisions are time-sensitive, and genetic counseling should follow any positive result to discuss residual risk and next steps [^0440a711] [^0962b15c].

> But wait, what if you are thinking of skipping screening entirely? I need to ensure you understand the implications. Screening is optional after counseling, and you may decline, but you should know that carrier status often has no symptoms and that residual risk remains after negative results; moreover, in Israel's mixed-ancestry population, a substantial fraction of at-risk couples are detected only with expanded panels, so declining screening means accepting an unknown risk that could have been identified and managed proactively [^43b57419] [^c1793eca].

> I should double-check the practical next steps if you proceed. In Israel, you can access the basic panel through your HMO and consider an expanded panel through hospital-based genetics institutes or commercial labs; pre- and post-test counseling are standard, and if both partners are carriers of the same autosomal recessive condition or if a woman is a carrier of an X-linked condition, you will be offered genetic counseling and options such as prenatal diagnosis or preimplantation genetic testing, with support for decision-making that aligns with your values [^cbbbd6ac] [^0962b15c].

> Putting this together, my prioritized recommendation is as follows: prioritize cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy, and fragile X as the foundation, then strongly consider an expanded Israeli panel that includes GJB2/GJB6, GBA, TYR, PAH, and HEXA given their high carrier frequency and the proportion of at-risk couples missed by ancestry-limited testing; aim for preconception timing when possible, and engage in counseling to understand results, residual risk, and reproductive options rather than skipping screening altogether [^2b7b2616] [^c1793eca] [^dc106a95].

In Israel, **carrier screening is not legally required** but is strongly recommended and widely offered through the public health system [^2b7b2616]. The most important conditions to screen for are **cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy, and fragile X syndrome**, which are included in the national program [^2b7b2616]. Additional screening is offered for **Tay-Sachs, Canavan, familial dysautonomia, and hemoglobinopathies**, especially relevant for Ashkenazi Jews and other high-risk groups [^fdbc4791] [^dd208ab8]. You can decline screening after counseling, but **early testing before pregnancy** allows more reproductive options and is advised [^0440a711] [^f9c9d024].

## Legal status of genetic screening in Israel

- **Not mandatory**: Carrier screening is not legally required in Israel, but it is strongly encouraged and integrated into routine prenatal care [^notfound].

- **National program**: The Israeli Ministry of Health funds a national carrier screening program covering severe, prevalent genetic conditions [^2b7b2616].

- **Voluntary participation**: Patients may decline screening after receiving counseling, but high uptake reflects strong public acceptance and accessibility [^e51f1036].

---

## Conditions included in the national screening program

The national program prioritizes conditions with **high carrier frequency**, **severe phenotype**, and **actionable reproductive options**:

| **Condition** | **Carrier frequency in israel** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Cystic fibrosis (CF) | 1:28–1:29 | Severe respiratory and digestive disease |
| Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) | 1:52 | Severe neuromuscular disease |
| Fragile X syndrome | 1:150–1:250 | Intellectual disability, autism, ovarian insufficiency |
| Tay-Sachs disease | 1:56 | Severe neurodegenerative disease |
| Canavan disease | 1:40–1:60 | Severe neurodegenerative disease |
| Familial dysautonomia | 1:30–1:32 | Severe autonomic and sensory neuropathy |
| Hemoglobinopathies (thalassemia, sickle cell) | Variable | Severe hematologic disease |

---

These conditions were selected for their **high carrier frequency**, **severe clinical impact**, and the availability of **reproductive options** (e.g. preimplantation genetic diagnosis, prenatal diagnosis, donor gametes) [^9ef05d9b].

---

## Additional screening for specific populations

- **Ashkenazi Jews**: Additional screening is offered for Gaucher disease, Niemann-Pick type A, Fanconi anemia group C, Bloom syndrome, and mucolipidosis IV [^dd208ab8].

- **Consanguineous couples**: Enhanced screening and counseling are recommended due to higher risk of recessive conditions [^50d84d39].

- **Expanded panels**: Some centers offer expanded carrier screening (ECS) covering 100+ conditions, identifying more at-risk couples than ethnicity-based panels alone [^c1793eca].

---

## Timing and process of screening

- **Preconception ideal**: Screening is best done before pregnancy to maximize reproductive options (e.g. PGD, donor gametes) [^0440a711] [^f9c9d024].

- **Sequential or concurrent**: Women are typically tested first; if a carrier, their partner is tested. Concurrent testing is used when time is limited (e.g. early pregnancy) [^0440a711] [^f9c9d024].

- **Counseling**: Pre- and post-test counseling are standard to explain results, risks, and options [^799489cd].

---

## Consequences of declining screening

You may decline screening after counseling, but you should consider:

- **Residual risk**: Even with negative results, a small risk remains due to test limitations [^43b57419].

- **Later detection**: Declining may delay identification of carrier couples until pregnancy, limiting options [^0440a711].

- **Informed decision-making**: Counseling ensures decisions align with values and preferences [^389aa366].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Strongly recommended**: CF, SMA, and fragile X for all couples planning pregnancy [^5ae1a912].

- **Additional screening**: Tay-Sachs, Canavan, familial dysautonomia, and hemoglobinopathies, especially for Ashkenazi Jews and other high-risk groups [^fdbc4791] [^dd208ab8].

- **Expanded panels**: Consider ECS for broader coverage, particularly in mixed-ancestry populations [^c1793eca].

- **Preconception testing**: Ideal timing to maximize reproductive options [^0440a711] [^f9c9d024].

- **Voluntary**: Screening is not mandatory, but declining should follow informed counseling [^43b57419].

---

In Israel, **carrier screening is not legally required** but is strongly recommended and widely accessible. The most important conditions are CF, SMA, and fragile X, with additional screening for Tay-Sachs, Canavan, familial dysautonomia, and hemoglobinopathies in high-risk groups. Early, informed testing before pregnancy is advised to allow the fullest range of reproductive options [^0440a711].

### Committee opinion no. 690: carrier screening in the age of genomic medicine [^2654e650]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Carrier screening baseline recommendations — universal and risk-based elements are outlined: Expanded carrier screening does not replace previous risk-based screening recommendations, and if obstetrician–gynecologists or other health care providers do not offer expanded carrier screening in their practice, screening recommendations for individual disorders should follow guidelines for carrier screening as outlined in Committee Opinion No. 691, Carrier Screening for Genetic Conditions. All patients who are considering pregnancy or are already pregnant, regardless of screening strategy and ethnicity, should be offered carrier screening for cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy, as well as a complete blood count and screening for thalassemias and hemoglobinopathies. Fragile X premutation carrier screening is recommended for women with a family history of fragile X-related disorders or intellectual disability suggestive of fragile X syndrome, or women with a personal history of ovarian insufficiency, and additional screening also may be indicated based on family history or specific ethnicity, including screening for a limited number of specific diseases in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish, African, Mediterranean, or Southeast Asian ancestry and screening individuals with a family history of or risk factors for genetic diseases.

### What are the goals of prenatal genetic testing? [^bf4e6dbd]. Seminars in Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

The landscape of genetic testing and screening has changed tremendously since the initial description of the molecular structure of DNA. Given this, it is critical that providers reflect on the goals of prenatal screening and diagnostic testing, and how these tests impact perinatal outcomes. The participants of this workshop were in agreement that the goal of prenatal genetic testing should be focused on improving outcomes for women and families. While prenatal testing has historically focused on the option for pregnancy termination, increasing numbers of prenatal and perinatal treatments are available. As more in utero therapies are developed, the detection of disorders that are amenable to, and would benefit from, prenatal or immediate neonatal targeted therapy will increasingly be a focus of prenatal testing. Prenatal genetic testing must also balance the ethical principles of autonomy and distributive justice. The workshop participants agreed that stakeholders such as medical professionals, professional societies, insurers, commercial laboratories, and the public should consider and come to agreement regarding the appropriate objectives for and use of these tests.

### Genetic screening for cystic fibrosis [^4d7cd8f5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The importance of the recent recommendations that address cystic fibrosis carrier screening cannot be overemphasized. For the first time, a systematic approach to offering or making screening available to all pregnant women in the hopes of providing refined risk estimates for a genetic disease has been established. Caucasian of European or Ashkenazi-Jewish descent should be offered screening. Within the proposed guidelines are ethnic-specific carrier frequencies (1/29) used to establish who should be offered testing and to whom testing should be made available. Recent recommendations have made clear that in a pan-ethnic population a frequency of 1/1,000 is required for inclusion into the cystic fibrosis mutation panel. A general framework for screening during pregnancy has been established (either concurrent or sequential). It will be interesting to watch as the fruits of the human genome project are inspected and applied to everyday clinical practice. No doubt the cost of screening will be reduced through advances in technology. The combined efforts of NIH, ACOG, and ACMG have provided the first set of comprehensive standards for screening of recessive diseases. How time changes these guidelines deserves following.

### Rationale… [^5a15fe2a]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

GENETIC TESTING Testing for BRCA1/2 mutations should be performed only when an individual has personal or family history that suggests an inherited cancer susceptibility, when an individual is willing to talk with a health professional who is suitably trained to provide genetic counseling and interpret test results, and when test results will aid in decision-making. Clinical practice guidelines recommend that BRCA1/2 mutation testing begin with a relative with known BRCA-related cancer, including male relatives, to determine if a clinically significant mutation is detected in the family before testing individuals without cancer. 29 If an affected family member with a BRCA-related cancer is not available, then the relative with the highest probability of mutation should be tested. The type of mutation analysis required depends on family history. Individuals from families with known mutations or from ancestry groups in which certain mutations are more common can be tested for these specific mutations. Because risk assessment is primarily based on family history, it is unclear how women with a limited or unknown family history should be assessed for BRCA1/2 mutation risk and potential referral to counseling or genetic testing. Tests for BRCA1/2 mutations are highly sensitive and specific for known mutations. The availability of testing options has changed since the 2013 U. S. Supreme Court ruling that determined human genes are not patentable. 30 Previously, BRCA1/2 mutation testing in the United States was mainly conducted by 1 laboratory. Since the ruling, the number of testing options has significantly increased, with more than 80 multigene panels that include BRCA1/2, as well as tests marketed directly to consumers.

TREATMENT AND INTERVENTIONS Management of increased cancer risk related to BRCA1/2 mutations is beyond the scope of this Recommendation Statement. In general, care for women with harmful BRCA1/2 mutations consists of a variety of interventions to lower future cancer risk. This includes intensive screening, risk-reducing medications, and risk-reducing mastectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy. The USPSTF recommendations are independent of the U. S. government. They do not represent the views of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, or the U. S. Public Health Service.

### Exome sequencing in every pregnancy? Results of trio exome sequencing in structurally normal fetuses [^e51f1036]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIAL AND METHODS

This is a retrospective study. We reviewed the pretest genetic counseling and pregnancy tests of all pES conducted between January 2020 and September 2023 at the Maccabbi health services genetic institute.

Prior to amniocentesis, all patients underwent genetic counseling evaluation by a board‐certified medical geneticist, as is mandatory in Israel prior to fetal exome sequencing.

2.1 Study groups

The study included all pregnancies considered low risk for genetic diseases: non‐consanguineous couples, fetuses that were presented as normal by all tests performed by the time of amniocentesis and had normal CMA results.

As part of a nationwide screening program, complimentary carrier screening for diseases with a carrier frequency exceeding 1 in 100 is extended to all pregnant women in Israel. Approximately 85% of the individuals in our study cohort engaged in these screening assessments. In instances where both prospective parents were identified as carriers for the same disease, they were subsequently excluded from the analysis.

Participants provided an extensive family history and disclosed all results of previous genetic testing. Pregnancy tests in all cases included NT measurement between 11 and 13 weeks of gestation, followed by detailed early fetal anomaly scans at 14–16 weeks and late fetal anomaly scans at 20–24 weeks of gestation. Furthermore, first and second trimester (triple test) maternal biochemical screenings were conducted and meticulously documented.

Prior to amniocentesis, all patients underwent genetic counseling evaluation by a board‐certified medical geneticist.

The same fetal DNA that was extracted from amniocentesis for the CMA was used for the pES. DNA was also extracted from parental samples.

In cases involving variants of uncertain significance (VUSs), additional imaging, such as MRI, may be requested if the variant is predicted to be associated with a specific phenotype.

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^a83a9f9a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Carrier screening is a term used to describe genetic testing that is performed on an individual who does not have any overt phenotype for a genetic disorder but may have one variant allele within a gene(s) associated with a diagnosis. Information about carrier screening should be provided to every pregnant woman. Carrier screening and counseling ideally should be performed before pregnancy because this enables couples to learn about their reproductive risk and consider the most complete range of reproductive options. A patient may decline any or all screening. When an individual is found to be a carrier for a genetic condition, his or her relatives are at risk of carrying the same mutation. The patient should be encouraged to inform his or her relatives of the risk and the availability of carrier screening. If an individual is found to be a carrier for a specific condition, the patient's reproductive partner should be offered testing in order to receive informed genetic counseling about potential reproductive outcomes. If both partners are found to be carriers of a genetic condition, genetic counseling should be offered. What follows is a detailed discussion of some of the more common genetic conditions for which carrier screening is recommended in at least some segments of the population.

Introduction

Genetic testing is becoming more prevalent in mainstream medical practice, providing the promise of early diagnosis and disease prevention in many medical areas, such as prenatal diagnosis, pediatrics, neurology, and oncology –. This trend is fueled by the increasing availability of genetic tests, a decrease in cost of DNA sequencing methods, as well as public awareness. However, genetic and genomic testing is complex and requires extensive training to appropriately provide guidance and recommendations. Genetic counselors (GCs) are domain experts in this area of medicine, but workforce shortages have resulted in extreme bottlenecks and delayed care, warranting exploration of supplemental solutions that can bridge this gap in patient care.

The purpose of carrier screening for genetic conditions before or early during pregnancy is to identify individuals and/or couples who carry variants associated with genetic diseases, and thus are at risk of transmitting a heritable disorder to their offspring. Detection allows appropriate genetic counseling and reproductive choices, including prenatal diagnosis and preimplantation genetic testing. Reproductive genetic carrier screening (RGCS) in Israel has been widespread since the 1990s, and patients are encouraged to undergo screening by their obstetricians. Carrier screening is routinely performed for all pregnant women through their health maintenance organizations, and funding is provided for a basic set of conditions by the Israeli Ministry of Health (MOH). Testing for an extended set of conditions is commercially available by several providers, including genetics institutes within medical centers.

The routine carrier screening workflow in Israel (Fig. 1), where screening has been practiced since the early 1990s, was developed when there were only a few tested conditions. Testing was then performed in a stepwise manner. First, the female partner was tested for a limited number of conditions; if she was found to be a carrier of an autosomal recessive disease, she received genetic counseling regarding the disease, its inheritance and the couples' reproductive risk, either by a face-to-face counseling session (F2F) or by telephone. Her reproductive partner was then referred for testing of the same gene. If both partners are found to be carriers of the same AR disease, or the woman was found to be a carrier of an X-linked disease, they receive F2F genetic counseling to discuss diagnosis and reproductive options. This process is long and time-consuming, especially when facing the growing availability of genetic tests and the shortage of GC services.

### Committee opinion no. 481: newborn screening [^7fc29481]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Newborn screening programs are mandatory, state-based public health programs. They provide newborns in the United States with presymptomatic testing and necessary follow-up care for a variety of medical conditions for which early intervention will improve neonatal and long-term health outcomes for the individual. Although current state requirements vary, the results of surveys and focus groups of expectant parents demonstrate that women and their families would like to receive information about newborn screening during their prenatal care. The Committee on Genetics recommends that obstetric care providers make resources regarding newborn screening available to patients through informational brochures, electronic sources, or through discussion during prenatal visits.

### Committee opinion no. 690: carrier screening in the age of genomic medicine [^43b57419]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Carrier screening in the age of genomic medicine — general approach and counseling states that ethnic-specific, panethnic, and expanded carrier screening are acceptable strategies for prepregnancy and prenatal carrier screening, and each obstetrician–gynecologist or other health care provider or practice should establish a standard approach that is consistently offered to and discussed with each patient, ideally before pregnancy. Screening for any condition is optional, and after counseling, a patient may decline any or all carrier screening; if a patient requests a screening strategy other than the one used by the obstetrician–gynecologist or other health care provider, the requested test should be made available to her after counseling on its limitations, benefits, and alternatives. Expanded carrier screening does not replace previous risk-based screening recommendations, and the determination of the appropriate screening approach should be based on the patient's family history and personal values after counseling. Referral to an obstetrician–gynecologist or other health care provider with genetics expertise should be considered for risk assessment, evaluation, and consideration of diagnostic testing as indicated for any patient with a family history of a genetic condition or concern for a genetic diagnosis. Carrier screening will not identify all individuals who are at risk of the screened conditions, and patients should be counseled regarding the residual risk with any test result.

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^86273532]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Carrier screening for genetic conditions — information about genetic carrier screening should be provided to every pregnant woman, and after counseling, a patient may decline any or all screening. Carrier screening and counseling ideally should be performed before pregnancy. If an individual is found to be a carrier for a specific condition, the individual's reproductive partner should be offered testing in order to receive informed genetic counseling about potential reproductive outcomes, and concurrent screening of the patient and her partner is suggested if there are time constraints for decisions about prenatal diagnostic evaluation. If both partners are found to be carriers of a genetic condition, genetic counseling should be offered, and prenatal diagnosis and advanced reproductive technologies to decrease the risk of an affected offspring should be discussed.

### International perspectives on the implementation of reproductive carrier screening [^b6d92923]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

Reproductive carrier screening started in some countries in the 1970s for hemoglobinopathies and Tay-Sachs disease. Cystic fibrosis carrier screening became possible in the late 1980s and with technical advances, screening of an ever increasing number of genes has become possible. The goal of carrier screening is to inform people about their risk of having children with autosomal recessive and X-linked recessive disorders, to allow for informed decision making about reproductive options. The consequence may be a decrease in the birth prevalence of these conditions, which has occurred in several countries for some conditions. Different programs target different groups (high school, premarital, couples before conception, couples attending fertility clinics, and pregnant women) as does the governance structure (public health initiative and user pays). Ancestry-based offers of screening are being replaced by expanded carrier screening panels with multiple genes that is independent of ancestry. This review describes screening in Australia, Cyprus, Israel, Italy, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It provides an insight into the enormous variability in how reproductive carrier screening is offered across the globe. This largely relates to geographical variation in carrier frequencies of genetic conditions and local health care, financial, cultural, and religious factors.

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^da97cd27]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Carrier screening for genetic conditions — when an individual is found to be a carrier for a genetic condition, the individual's relatives are at risk of carrying the same mutation, and the patient should be encouraged to inform his or her relatives of the risk and the availability of carrier screening; the obstetrician–gynecologist or other health care provider should not disclose this information without permission from the patient. It is important to obtain the family history of the patient and, if possible, her partner as a screening tool for inherited risk, and the family history should include the ethnic background of family members as well as any known consanguinity.

### Changing trends in carrier screening for genetic disease in the United States [^bedacc8b]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2015). Low credibility.

Given the reduced cost of screening for expanded disease panels, the preconception screening model in the Jewish community sets an excellent precedent for similar screening in the general population. Implementing this screening as a component of the well‐woman examination, rather than waiting until pregnancy is proximate or underway, improves the standard of care by helping many patients make autonomous decisions and consider modern reproductive technologies.

Preconception genetic screening is defined as carrier testing for genetic disorders prior to pregnancy onset, such as at the annual OB/GYN well‐visit exam. Between the ages of 19 and 39, national surveys indicate that 84% of women have seen a health care provider within the previous year and most women of reproductive age pursue preventative health services annually. 29 The well‐woman visit presents an opportunity to review family history and discuss the available testing options without the stress of an ongoing pregnancy. 30 The ACOG Committee on Genetics supports screening in the preconception period over prenatal period. Since 2005, the committee has released four opinions all recommending preconception genetic screening. 3, 6, 30, 31 Despite the opportunity to educate women before they conceive, only 1 in 6 family physicians or OB/GYN providers gives preconception care. This implies the need to better understand the barriers to routine implementation of preconception health and education. A study by Jack et al. reviews these barriers in detail which include lack of clinical training on health promotion. The study suggests a technological solution to educate patients virtually and potentially alleviate common concerns around lack of preconception care. 32

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^3f3385cd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Carrier screening — general principles emphasize informed choice, timing, partner testing, and documentation: Information about genetic carrier screening should be provided to every pregnant woman, and after counseling, a patient may decline any or all screening. Carrier screening and counseling ideally should be performed before pregnancy to enable consideration of reproductive options, including advanced reproductive technologies. If an individual is found to be a carrier, the individual's reproductive partner should be offered testing, and concurrent screening of the patient and her partner is suggested when timelines for prenatal diagnostic decisions are constrained. If both partners are carriers, genetic counseling should be offered and prenatal diagnosis and advanced reproductive technologies to decrease the risk of an affected offspring should be discussed. Prenatal carrier screening does not replace newborn screening, nor does newborn screening replace the potential value of prenatal carrier screening. Carriers' relatives are at increased risk, patients should be encouraged to inform relatives, and clinicians should not disclose this information without the patient's permission. Family history, including ethnic background and any known consanguinity, is important for risk assessment; individuals with a positive family history should be offered carrier screening and may benefit from genetic counseling, ideally with information on the specific mutation. Carrier screening for a particular condition generally should be performed only once and documented in the health record, and any decision to rescreen should be undertaken only with the guidance of a genetics professional who can assess the incremental benefit of repeat testing for additional mutations.

### Screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities: ACOG practice bulletin, number 226 [^6d8dc073]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin 226 Level A recommendations — screening options and approach: The following recommendations and conclusions are based on good and consistent scientific evidence (Level A). Prenatal genetic screening (serum screening with or without nuchal translucency (NT) ultrasound or cell-free DNA screening) and diagnostic testing (chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis) options should be discussed and offered to all pregnant women regardless of maternal age or risk of chromosomal abnormality, and after review and discussion, every patient has the right to pursue or decline prenatal genetic screening and diagnostic testing. If screening is accepted, patients should have one prenatal screening approach, and should not have multiple screening tests performed simultaneously. Cell-free DNA is the most sensitive and specific screening test for the common fetal aneuploidies; nevertheless, it has the potential for false-positive and false-negative results, and cell-free DNA testing is not equivalent to diagnostic testing.

### Updates in genetic screening for the general obstetrician [^66e175ad]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

The number of prenatal genetic screening options, including aneuploidy screening and carrier screening, has drastically increased with rapid advancements in DNA sequencing technologies. Noninvasive prenatal screening analyzing cell-free DNA has quickly been integrated into routine prenatal care as it is the most sensitive and specific screening method for pregnancies at increased and average risk of fetal aneuploidy. The aim of this article is to outline current recommendations for cell-free DNA screening and carrier screening, important aspects of pretest and posttest counseling for obstetric providers, and which patients should be referred to a genetic specialist.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 762: prepregnancy counseling [^fdbc4791]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Prepregnancy counseling — family and genetic history screening recommendations specify whom to counsel for key conditions. For Canavan disease, carrier screening is for those of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and when only one partner is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, that individual should be offered screening first; if it is determined that this individual is a carrier, the other partner should be offered screening. For familial dysautonomia, carrier screening is for those of Ashkenazi Jewish descent with the same approach when only one partner is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. For cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy, the table lists "All women who are considering pregnancy." For fragile X, any woman with a family history of fragile X-related disorders or intellectual disability suggestive of fragile X syndrome and any woman younger than the age of 40 with unexplained ovarian insufficiency are included; women without risk factors who request fragile X screening may be tested after informed consent. For hemoglobinopathies, couples at risk of having a child with thalassemia or sickle cell disease should be offered genetic counseling to review prenatal testing and reproduction options. For Tay–Sachs disease, if either member of the couple is of Ashkenazi Jewish, French–Canadian, or Cajun descent, or there is a family history consistent with Tay–Sachs disease, screening should be offered; biochemical testing can be altered in women who are pregnant or using oral contraceptive pills, so leukocyte testing must be used in these patients.

### Practice bulletin no. 162: prenatal diagnostic testing for genetic disorders [^454f023c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Prenatal diagnostic testing for genetic disorders — these recommendations and conclusions are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (Level C) and state that all pregnant women should be offered prenatal assessment for aneuploidy by screening or diagnostic testing regardless of maternal age or other risk factors; prenatal genetic testing cannot identify all abnormalities or problems in a fetus, and any testing should be focused on the individual patient's risks, reproductive goals, and preferences; and genetic testing should be discussed as early as possible in pregnancy, ideally at the first obstetric visit, so that first-trimester options are available. Procedure-related pregnancy loss attributable to a prenatal diagnostic procedure is estimated to be approximately 0.1–0.3% in procedures performed by experienced health care providers, and the loss rates for amniocentesis and CVS are both very low. Transmission of HIV with amniocentesis does not appear to be increased in women treated with CART when the viral load is undetectable.

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^344a7695]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Prepregnancy or prenatal carrier screening for fragile X — fragile X premutation carrier screening is recommended for women with a family history of fragile X-related disorders or intellectual disability suggestive of fragile X syndrome and who are considering pregnancy or are currently pregnant. If a woman has unexplained ovarian insufficiency or failure or an elevated follicle-stimulating hormone level before age 40 years, fragile X carrier screening is recommended. If a patient with no family history requests fragile X screening, it is reasonable to offer screening after informed consent. All identified individuals with intermediate results and carriers of a fragile X premutation or full mutation should be provided follow-up genetic counseling; although these guidelines will not detect most premutation carriers, they target a higher prevalence group based on current carrier frequency data.

### Cystic fibrosis prenatal screening in genetic counseling practice: recommendations of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^d4ac16af]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2005). Low credibility.

For over a decade, prenatal screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) has been considered a model for the integration of genetic testing into routine medical practice. Data from pilot studies and public policy discourse have led to recommendations by some professional organizations that CF screening should be offered or made available to pregnant women and their partners, and to couples planning a pregnancy. It is crucial that genetic counselors gain thorough understanding of the complexities of CF and the implications of positive test results, so that they may serve as a reliable, educated referral base and resource for health care providers and their patients. While not all pregnant women will be referred for genetic counseling prior to CF carrier testing, genetic counselors often will be asked to counsel clients after they have a positive test result, or who are found to be at increased risk. Genetic counselors can play an important role in providing accurate and current information as well as support for patients' informed decisions. These recommendations were created by a multicenter working group of genetic counselors with expertise in CF and are based on personal clinical experience, review of pertinent English language medical articles, and reports of expert committees. The recommendations should not be construed as dictating an exclusive course of management, nor does the use of such recommendations guarantee a particular outcome. These recommendations do not displace a health care provider's professional judgment based on the clinical circumstances of a particular client.

Disclaimer

These Technical Standards and Guidelines were developed primarily as an educational resource for clinical laboratory geneticists to help them provide quality clinical laboratory genetic services. Adherence to these standards and guidelines is voluntary and does not necessarily assure a successful medical outcome. These Standards and Guidelines should not be considered inclusive of all proper procedures and tests or exclusive of other procedures and tests that are reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. In determining the propriety of any specific procedure or test, the clinical laboratory geneticist should apply his or her own professional judgment to the specific circumstances presented by the individual patient or specimen. Clinical laboratory geneticists are encouraged to document in the patient's record the rationale for the use of a particular procedure or test, whether or not it is in conformance with these Standards and Guidelines. They also are advised to take notice of the date any particular standard or guidelines was adopted, and to consider other relevant medical and scientific information that becomes available after that date.

### Evaluation of cystic fibrosis carrier screening programs according to genetic screening criteria [^55b21823]. Genetics in Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Genetic screening programs should meet certain criteria before they can be introduced into the community. The aim of this study was to discuss pilot studies for cystic fibrosis (CF) carrier screening before and during pregnancy in the light of important genetic screening criteria. Overall, CF carrier screening meets the prerequisites that justify screening. However, more specific criteria for the development of screening programs were not always taken into consideration. Most project leaders concentrated on uptake as an important outcome, and less on informed decision-making. To further investigate the long-term psychological and social effects of genetic screening, continuous monitoring of screening projects is recommended.

### What are the required components of pre-and post-test counseling? [^799489cd]. Seminars in Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

Prenatal care providers are faced with a myriad of decisions about how to offer genetic screening and testing in ways that are appropriate to their patient population and their workflow. Among the critical issues brought to the forefront of rapidly advancing genetic and genomic technologies is the importance of pre- and post-test counseling. This document is a synthesis of proceedings of a workshop sponsored by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, on January 24–25, 2017, during which invited experts discussed required components of pre- and post-test counseling and associated concerns in the provision of prenatal care.

### Committee opinion no. 690 summary: carrier screening in the age of genomic medicine [^1144cf86]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Carrier screening, whether targeted or expanded, allows individuals to consider their range of reproductive options. Ultimately, the goal of genetic screening is to provide individuals with meaningful information that they can use to guide pregnancy planning based on their personal values. Ethnic-specific, panethnic, and expanded carrier screening are acceptable strategies for prepregnancy and prenatal carrier screening. Because all of these are acceptable strategies, each obstetrician-gynecologist or other health care provider or practice should establish a standard approach that is consistently offered to and discussed with each patient, ideally before pregnancy. Carrier screening will not identify all individuals who are at risk of the screened conditions. Patients should be counseled regarding the residual risk with any test result. Screening for any condition is optional and, after counseling, a patient may decline any or all carrier screening. If a patient requests a screening strategy other than the one used by the obstetrician-gynecologist or other health care provider, the requested test should be made available to her after counseling on its limitations, benefits, and alternatives. Expanded carrier screening does not replace previous risk-based screening recommendations. The determination of the appropriate screening approach for any individual patient should be based on the patient's family history and personal values after counseling. Referral to an obstetrician-gynecologist or other health care provider with genetics expertise should be considered for risk assessment, evaluation, and consideration of diagnostic testing as indicated for any patient with a family history of a genetic condition or concern for a genetic diagnosis.

### Determinant of prenatal diagnostic testing among women with increased risk of fetal aneuploidy and genetic disorders [^31ef1a5f]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The way patients use this information is dependent on numerous factors. Decisions for prenatal testing may be influenced by region, culture, and society. An international study that recruited pregnant women from Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Singapore, and the United Kingdom asked participants about their preferences for prenatal testing and reasons for those choices. The overall majority of women stated that they would select NIPS. However, the majority of women from Portugal and Italy selected diagnostic prenatal testing over NIPS for Down syndrome, and this was contrary to the outcome of our study. One-third of women from the Netherlands and Israel would have opted out of both tests. Hill et al postulates that the larger population of Orthodox Jewish women in Israel may have played a role in their testing decisions due to cultural factors. When asked what factors influenced their decisions, women in Iceland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom cited the safety of the tests and procedures as a main contributor to their decision.

Another common reason for proceeding with prenatal diagnostic testing is advanced maternal age, defined as 35 years or older. It is one of the greatest indications for diagnostic testing due to its associated increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities in this demographic. A study of pregnant Israeli women with normal Down syndrome screening results and normal ultrasound findings, found that being older than 35 years was the most significant factor for pregnant women to ultimately opt for amniocentesis, and this was in stark contrast to previous studies. However, research completed in Taipei found different reasons why patients chose to undergo genetic amniocentesis following positive maternal serum screening. Women in the study cited that amniocentesis was a routine prenatal procedure, they wanted to avoid the risk of having a child with Down syndrome, and they had an inherent trust in technology and their medical providers. Future areas of research may examine patient decisions about pregnancy outcomes among those who undergo diagnostic testing.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^4ff2be2d]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Approaches for carrier detection

Within the context of managing the health burden of the haemoglobinopathies, laboratory diagnosis plays a key role, identifying carrier couples and offering them reproductive choices. Haemoglobinopathies are unique among all genetic diseases in that detection of carriers is possible by haematological and biochemical tests rather than DNA analysis. Thus, it is recommended that, with currently available technologies, carrier detection should be mandatory using haematological and biochemical tests. However, DNA analysis should be employed for the determination of carrier status in complex cases or when the haematological/biochemical results are unclear. Depending on acceptable practices in each society, at-risk couples can then be offered the reproductive choice to avoid the birth-affected children, or helped to prepare for the possible birth of a severely affected child. Among the available options to avoid having affected children are, before marriage, a change in partner choice; or, after marriage, by remaining childless, opting for gamete donation or adoption. However couples rarely take these options. Instead it is more common for at-risk couples to avoid the birth of an affected child by opting for a conventional prenatal diagnosis in early pregnancy, or before pregnancy by choosing preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). Both conventional prenatal diagnosis and PGD involve prior variant characterization in the parents and subsequent fetal (or embryo) DNA analysis. Thus genetic services for haemoglobinopathies require close collaboration between several specialities, most notably haematology, genetic counselling, molecular genetics and fetal medicine.

These guidelines will focus on best practice in laboratory methods and interpretation of results for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis. For the best strategy to detect at-risk couples there are certain factors that should also be taken into consideration, including the frequency of the disease in endemic and non-endemic immigration countries, the heterogeneity of the genetic defects in the target society, the knowledge of genotype–phenotype correlation (supported by access to original papers as well as to genomic databases), the resources available and finally the social, legal, cultural and religious factors.

In addition screening may target newborns or adolescents, or premarital, preconceptional or antenatal stages. For families wishing to avoid the birth of affected children, preconception or antenatal screening is the most effective approach and is widely applied in many high-risk populations. Newborn screening is less effective for primary screening and prospectively informing carriers about their reproductive risks, but it is applied in certain countries to support better infant healthcare through prompt identification of affected babies. Pre-operative screening of individuals from populations with increased incidence of sickle cell is also indicated.

### Committee opinion no. 690: carrier screening in the age of genomic medicine [^afa36b2a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Glossary — definitions for carrier screening terminology include the following. Ashkenazi Jewish refers to individuals whose Jewish relatives originate from Eastern or Central Europe. Carrier screening is genetic testing performed on an individual who does not have any symptoms of a particular genetic disorder but may have one abnormal allele for the gene that is associated with the disorder. Consanguinity is a union between two individuals who are second cousins or closer in family relationship. Ethnic-based screening is disease screening targeted at high-risk populations, such as screening individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent for Tay–Sachs disease. Expanded carrier screening is disease screening that evaluates an individual's carrier state for multiple conditions at once and regardless of ethnicity. Panethnic screening means individuals are screened regardless of their ethnic background, with an example being the current recommendation for screening every pregnant woman for cystic fibrosis once during her lifetime. Prevalence is the percentage of a population affected by a particular disease at a particular time, and residual risk is a calculated risk that an individual carries an abnormal allele after a negative screening test result.

### Look before you leap: genomic screening in obstetrics and gynecology [^2add19b7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

There are a number of new genetic tests and a variety of recommendations for obstetrician-gynecologists. In recent years, screening of low-risk pregnant women with noninvasive prenatal testing has been proposed as well as universal BRCA1 and BRCA2 screening of all women regardless of risk status. Both proposed genetic screening tests raise complicated issues relating to predictive value, cost, and consequences after screening to both the health care system as a whole as well as serious potential adverse consequences for the patient. In addition, there are significant barriers relating to clinician education in proper use of these genetic tests as well as logistic issues of performing adequate genetic counseling in a busy general practice. We recommend that pregnant women offered noninvasive prenatal testing be informed of its advantages and disadvantages compared with standard screening with the caveat that positive noninvasive prenatal tests must be confirmed with further, invasive testing. We recommend against population genetic screening of all women for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations until there are comprehensive data regarding harms and benefits as well as cost-effectiveness. Finally, we recommend that new educational models for genetics be developed for obstetrics and gynecology residency training so that future health care providers will be prepared for the opportunities and challenges that genetic testing creates.

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^cc2aa24b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hemoglobinopathy and thalassemia screening — pregnancy care includes that a complete blood count with red blood cell indices should be performed in all women who are currently pregnant; if indices indicate a low mean corpuscular hemoglobin or mean corpuscular volume, hemoglobin electrophoresis also should be performed, and it should also be performed when ethnicity raises suspicion, ideally before pregnancy, with repeat testing not necessary if prior results are available. Determination of mean corpuscular volume is recommended to assess risk of α-thalassemia or β-thalassemia; patients with a low mean corpuscular volume (less than 80 fL) may have one of the thalassemia traits and should have hemoglobin electrophoresis, and measurement of serum ferritin levels is recommended. β-thalassemia is associated with elevated hemoglobin F and elevated hemoglobin A2 levels (more than 3.5%). Neither hemoglobin electrophoresis nor solubility testing can identify α-thalassemia trait; if the mean corpuscular volume is below normal, iron deficiency is excluded, and electrophoresis is not consistent with β-thalassemia trait, then DNA-based testing should be used to detect α-globin gene deletions characteristic of α-thalassemia. Solubility tests are inadequate for screening and fail to identify several important traits, and if both partners are identified as carriers of a gene for abnormal hemoglobins, genetic counseling is recommended.

Recommendation framework and consensus — A draft recommendation was constructed in accordance with the GRADE EtD framework, which offers four possible recommendations, as follows: strongly recommend for, conditionally recommend for, conditionally recommend against, and strongly recommend against the intervention. From the viewpoint of the clinician, a conditional recommendation for an intervention means that the evidence supports its use, and most patients would find the intervention acceptable, but the final recommendation should be directed by shared decision-making between the clinician and patient, which takes into account specific features of the patient, their preferences, and their values. Unanimous agreement was obtained for the final recommendation.

### Committee opinion no. 690: carrier screening in the age of genomic medicine [^5ae1a912]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Carrier screening — condition-specific recommendations indicate that all patients who are considering pregnancy or are already pregnant, regardless of screening strategy and ethnicity, should be offered carrier screening for cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy, as well as a complete blood count and screening for thalassemias and hemoglobinopathies. Fragile X premutation carrier screening is recommended for women with a family history of fragile X-related disorders or intellectual disability suggestive of fragile X syndrome, or women with a personal history of ovarian insufficiency, and additional screening also may be indicated based on family history or specific ethnicity. Couples with consanguinity should be offered genetic counseling to discuss the increased risk of recessive conditions being expressed in their offspring and the limitations and benefits of carrier screening. Carrier screening will not identify all individuals who are at risk of the screened conditions.

### Decision-making for prenatal genetic screening: how will pregnant women navigate a growing number of aneuploidy and carrier screening options? [^b5b8dd32]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we have identified significant clinical and ethical challenges to ensuring that patients have the information and decision support needed to make informed choices about their prenatal genetic screening options during pregnancy. Thus, it is necessary for healthcare providers and systems to revisit how to structure the medical decision-making processes during the onset of prenatal care in a way that is commensurate with advances in prenatal genomics. It is unlikely that one approach will solve the challenges presented by emerging genomic applications in prenatal care. Instead, we must look for a combination of resources to best prepare for the individualized needs of patients as they consider their prenatal genetic screening and diagnostic testing options. This presents a prime opportunity for innovation, not just in leveraging advances in digital educational tools and resources, but approaches to optimize the important discussions that patients may have with their healthcare provider over the course of the pregnancy.

Expanded carrier screening (ECS) recommendation — We recommend the option of expanded carrier screening as an alternative to ethnicity-based carrier screening for all individuals considering reproduction and for all pregnant reproductive pairs. This is a conditional recommendation based on the balance of benefits and harms of ECS, and low and moderate certainty in the evidence. There are no specific clinical criteria or set of conditions associated with the conditional recommendation for ECS.

In addition, as prenatal genetic panels become increasingly complex, it will become more difficult to structure and individualize a patient-centered decision-making process. For instance, we found that participants preferred to learn about all of the conditions on a panel when there were only 5–10 conditions; however, when the number of conditions increased to 50 or 100, participants preferred to defer learning about conditions until the post-test period. While some authors have suggested using a generic informed consent process for expanded panels, this approach may not meet patients' needs for informed and autonomous decision-making for panels with less than 50 conditions, as it is necessary to ensure patients understand how screening accuracy may decrease as the number of conditions on a panel increases. In addition, participants in this study found personal value in panel tests that can provide information about a range of different identifiable variants that can affect the quality of life or viability. This preference included not only information about variants associated with severe childhood-onset conditions but also those associated with adult-onset conditions and conditions which have an uncertain impact on the quality of life, although screening is not recommended for such conditions. Thus, there may be a need to align patient preferences with evidence-based guidance, an effort complicated by the continued availability of expanded panels that depart from current guidelines.

### Expanded carrier screening: what conditions should we screen for? [^58511abb]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2023). Medium credibility.

Carrier screening tests reproductive couples for their risk of having children affected by serious monogenic conditions. Carrier screening has historically been offered for certain conditions in high-risk populations. However, more recent evidence has shown that offering carrier screening to all patients, regardless of their ethnicity, more effectively and equitably identifies at-risk couples. Coupled with technology that enables screening for a nearly unlimited number of conditions, this expanded carrier screening (ECS) approach is now supported by professional society guidelines. Despite recent recommendations by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics to screen all patients who are pregnant or considering pregnancy for 113 conditions, questions remain about what conditions should be included on a core ECS panel. Here, we briefly review the history of carrier screening and guidelines on criteria for panel design. We then suggest which of these criteria are most critical, as well as thresholds to identify which conditions meet these criteria. Based on these interpretations, we recommend a core panel of 64 conditions that would identify the vast majority of at-risk couples. Widespread adoption of a core panel such as this would result in a marked improvement in the number of patients currently receiving comprehensive carrier screening.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 762: prepregnancy counseling [^02f88e6b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Prepregnancy counseling — family and genetic history indicates that a genetic and family history of the patient and her partner should be obtained. When any genetic disease carrier status is diagnosed in one or both partners, full medical records review and genetic counseling are recommended to educate the patient on the effects of the disease and the potential options for pregenancy and early pregnancy screening of offspring. Women who present for prepregnancy counseling should be offered screening for the same genetic conditions as recommended for pregnant women, though insurance coverage for screening may be lacking and may be a barrier for some patients. Screening in the prepregnancy period offers the additional advantages of identifying, before pregnancy, couples at risk of having children with genetic diseases and offering appropriate testing to optimize patient education, counseling, and options for achieving pregnancy.

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^49b8f722]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Tay–Sachs disease — screening indications and methods include the following: Screening for Tay–Sachs disease should be offered when considering pregnancy or during pregnancy if either member of a couple is of Ashkenazi Jewish, French–Canadian, or Cajun descent, and those with a family history consistent with Tay–Sachs disease also should be offered screening. When only one partner is high risk, the high-risk partner should be offered screening first, and if found to be a carrier, the other partner also should be offered screening. In pregnancy and in women taking oral contraceptives, enzyme testing should be performed using leukocyte testing because serum testing is associated with an increased false-positive rate. If screening is performed as part of pan-ethnic expanded carrier screening, recognize limitations of the mutations screened, and in the presence of a family history, expanded carrier screening panels are not the best approach unless the familial mutation is included on the panel. Referral to an obstetrician–gynecologist or other health care provider with genetics expertise may be helpful when enzyme test results are inconclusive or when discussing carrier testing for an individual of non-Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity whose partner is a known carrier.

### Assessing clinical utility of preconception expanded carrier screening regarding residual risk for neurodevelopmental disorders [^5970fd55]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Targeted carrier screening in high-risk populations has been shown to reduce the incidence of several diseases, such as Tay-Sachs in Ashkenazi Jews, cystic fibrosis in White Europeans, and alpha/beta-thalassemia in Sardinians –. However, expanded carrier screening (ECS), where more genes or pathogenic variants are tested in a pan-ethnic manner, seems to be more cost-effective. Additionally, clinical utility of preconception ECS has been shown regarding the reproductive decision making in couples found to be at-risk of having an affected child, of which 62–77% pursued actions to avoid an affected pregnancy. Moreover, all of the 0.2–2.6% of couples found to be at-risk in other studies took action and opted for PGT-M (Preimplantation Genetic Testing for Monogenic disease). Nevertheless, the question of residual general risk after expanded carrier screening remains open and hampers genetic counselling.

Despite existing recommendations for gene panel design, and variant pathogenicity classification, the latter remains vague and most ECS studies differ greatly in numbers of genes tested ranging from tens to a few hundreds with little overlap –. Accordingly, the carrier and (estimated) at-risk-couple frequencies vary widely –.

The recently released ACMG guidelines provide criteria on gene selection for expanded carrier screening, but recommend replacing this term with "Tier 1–4 carrier screening". Tier-1 includes screening of CFTR, SMN1 and medically and family-based risk genes, Tier 2 includes Tier-1 plus genes with carrier frequency ≥ 1/100, Tier-3 includes Tier-2 plus genes with carrier frequency ≥ 1/200 and X-linked conditions, and Tier-4 includes Tier-3 plus genes with carrier frequency < 1/200. The ACMG recommends to offer Tier-3 screening to all pregnant women and those planning a pregnancy, while for consanguineous pregnancies Tier-4 screening should be considered. Thereby, all tiers should be restricted to disease genes with at least moderately severe phenotypes.

### Genetic counseling and screening of consanguineous couples and their offspring: recommendations of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^03b08772]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this document is to provide recommendations for genetic counseling and screening for consanguineous couples (related as second cousins or closer) and their offspring with the goals of1. providing preconception reproductive options2. improving pregnancy outcome and identifying reproductive choices3. reducing morbidity and mortality in the 1st years of life, and4. respecting psychosocial and multicultural issues. The recommendations are the opinions of a multicenter working group (the Consanguinity Working Group (CWG)) with expertise in genetic counseling, medical genetics, biochemical genetics, genetic epidemiology, pediatrics, perinatology, and public health genetics, which was convened by the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC). The consensus of the CWG and NSGC reviewers is that beyond a thorough medical family history with follow-up of significant findings, no additional preconception screening is recommended for consanguineous couples. Consanguineous couples should be offered similar genetic screening as suggested for any couple of their ethnic group. During pregnancy, consanguineous couples should be offered maternal-fetal serum marker screening and high-resolution fetal ultrasonography. Newborns should be screened for impaired hearing and detection of treatable inborn errors of metabolism. These recommendations should not be construed as dictating an exclusive course of management, nor does use of such recommendations guarantee a particular outcome. The professional judgment of a health care provider, familiar with the facts and circumstances of a specific case, will always supersede these recommendations.

### Factors that impact on women's decision-making around prenatal genomic tests: an international discrete choice survey [^4b29cbc5]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Several country‐specific differences in women's preferences for receiving uncertain results were identified, including length of time to get a result, who explains the result, and the return of VUS and SFs. Differences in the importance of how long it takes to get a result may reflect national legislation around termination of pregnancy, which varies in terms of time limits, mandatory counseling and third party authorization procedures. These differences may also be related to religious, ethical and cultural values concerning the acceptability of terminating a pregnancy and the moral status of the fetus, as well as whether government benefits, health services and/or support groups exist for children with disabilitiesand whether shame or stigma is associated with the birth of a baby with a genetic condition. Varying attitudes towards the importance of receiving SFs and VUS may also reflect differing views around ownership of genomic dataand whether the costs of prenatal tests are covered by state or out‐of‐pocket expenses; in a recent international study, some HPs felt that they had a responsibility to return VUS when patients had paid out‐of‐pocket. Differences in preferences towards who explains the test results may be related to whether or not there is easy access to genetic services, genetic health literacy, or the role played by midwives in different countries. Overall, our findings support the development of guidance around return of uncertain results that take into account cultural and health system differences. These differences highlight the importance of tailored counseling, during which prospective parents can articulate their values, and identify and discuss options.

Prepregnancy counseling — family and genetic history screening: The table lists carrier screening for those of Ashkenazi Jewish descent for Canavan disease and familial dysautonomia, with the directive that when only one partner is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, that individual should be offered screening first and, if it is determined that this individual is a carrier, the other partner should be offered screening. It includes "All women who are considering pregnancy" for cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy. For fragile X, it specifies "Any woman with a family history of fragile X–related disorders or intellectual disability suggestive of fragile X syndrome and any woman younger than the age of 40 with unexplained ovarian insufficiency," and notes that "Women without risk factors who request fragile X screening may be tested after informed consent." For hemoglobinopathies, "Couples at risk of having a child with thalassemia or sickle cell disease should be offered genetic counseling to review prenatal testing and reproduction options." For Tay–Sachs disease, "If either member of the couple is of Ashkenazi Jewish, French–Canadian, or Cajun descent; those with a family history consistent with Tay–Sachs disease also should be offered screening," and "Biochemical testing can be altered in women who are pregnant or using oral contraceptive pills, so leukocyte testing must be used in these patients."

Pretest counseling should be a process of shared decision making and should include a discussion of the patient's risk of aneuploidy and other genetic diseases, and the differences between screening and diagnostic testing also should be discussed.

### ACMG position statement on prenatal / preconception expanded carrier screening [^9cf3a154]. Genetics in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

For years, clinicians have offered gene-by-gene carrier screening to patients and couples considering future pregnancy or those with an ongoing pregnancy early in gestation. Examples include ethnic-specific screening offered to Ashkenazi Jewish patients and panethnic screening for cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy. Next-generation sequencing methods now available permit screening for many more disorders with high fidelity, quick turnaround time, and lower costs. However, instituting these technologies carries with it perils that must be addressed. The basis for the selection of disorders on expanded carrier screening panels should be disclosed. The information provided about disorders with mild phenotypes, variable expression, low penetrance, and/or characterized by an adult onset should be complete and transparent, allowing patients to opt out of receiving these test results. Patients also must be made aware of the concept of residual risk following negative test results. Laboratories have a duty to participate in and facilitate this information transfer.

### Expanded carrier screening for reproductive risk assessment: an evidence-based practice guideline from the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^41fafdd0]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2023). High credibility.

Expanded carrier screening (ECS) — conclusion and conditional recommendation: Expanded carrier screening is a useful tool in family planning and obstetrical care, and to be equitable it should be made accessible to all people considering reproduction, pursuing reproduction, or who may reasonably have the opportunity to reproduce; equitable carrier screening practices rely on the discontinued use of race-based medicine. The use of ECS is conditionally recommended for all reproductive-aged individuals who desire knowledge regarding the risk of infant or early-childhood onset disease in their offspring following an informed consent discussion, and this is a conditional recommendation based on the available evidence and the balance of known benefits and harms. ECS offers the greatest benefit when performed prior to conception, and current clinical practice modifications are necessary to accommodate the optimal implementation of preconception ECS; efforts should be directed to addressing recognized barriers to ECS, including cost/insurance coverage for both members of a reproductive pair, adequate informed consent, provider and patient education needs, and wider access to genetics professionals as needed in the prenatal and preconception periods alike.

### Expanded targeted preconception screening panel in Israel: findings and insights [^c1793eca]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

We aimed to analyse the efficacy and added value of a targeted Israeli expanded carrier screening panel (IL-ECSP), beyond the first-tier test covered by the Israeli Ministry of Health (IMOH) and the second-tier covered by the Health Maintenance Organisations (HMOs).

Methods

A curated variant-based IL-ECSP, tailored to the uniquely diverse Israeli population, was offered at two tertiary hospitals and a major genetics laboratory. The panel includes 1487 variants in 357 autosomal recessive and X-linked genes.

Results

We analysed 10115 Israeli samples during an 18-month period. Of these, 6036 (59.7%) were tested as couples and 4079 (40.3%) were singles. Carriers were most frequently identified with mutations in the following genes: GJB2/GJB6 (1:22 allele frequency), CFTR (1:28), GBA (1:34), TYR (1:39), PAH (1:50), SMN1 (1:52) and HEXA (1:56). Of 3018 couples tested, 753 (25%) had no findings, in 1464 (48.5%) only one partner was a carrier, and in 733 (24.3%) both were carriers of different diseases. We identified 79 (2.6%) at-risk couples, where both partners are carriers of the same autosomal recessive condition, or the female carries an X-linked disease. Importantly, 48.1% of these would not have been detected by ethnically-based screening tests currently provided by the IMOH and HMOs, for example, variants in GBA, TYR, PAH and GJB2/GJB6.

Conclusion

This is the largest cohort of targeted ECSP testing, tailored to the diverse Israeli population. The IL-ECSP expands the identification of couples at risk and empowers their reproductive choices. We recommend endorsing an expanded targeted panel to the National Genetic Carrier Screening programme.

### Should pregnant women be screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection? A prospective multicenter cohort study [^1dca5df1]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), ranges from asymptomatic to severe infection. We aimed to compare the prevalence of COVID-19 in asymptomatic pregnant versus nonpregnant women in order to establish recommendations for a COVID-19 screening strategy.

Methods

A prospective multicenter cohort study was conducted. Asymptomatic pregnant or nonpregnant women after March 2020 (the time when COVID-19 was first detected in north Israel) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test, anti-nucleocapsid IgG, and anti-spike IgG. Diagnosis was made if at least one test result was positive. Pregnant women were tested between 34 and 42weeks, mostly at birth.

Results

Among the 297 participating women, 152 were pregnant and 145 were nonpregnant. The prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 was similar between the groups (4 [2.6%] and 8 [5.5%], respectively; P = 0.2). All women with COVID-19 delivered healthy appropriate-for-gestational-age babies without malformations, at term.

Conclusions

The rate of asymptomatic COVID-19 in pregnant women is low and comparable to the rate among nonpregnant women. Pregnancy outcomes are favorable. Future screening programs should consider that one of 25 screened asymptomatic women will be positive.

### Optimizing use of existing prenatal genetic tests: screening and diagnostic testing for aneuploidy [^28ad54ae]. Seminars in Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

Screening and diagnostic testing for detection of fetal aneuploidy has been an integral part of prenatal care for over three decades. The recent introduction of new technologies, such as cell free DNA (cfDNA) screening and preimplantation genetic screening, has created increased complexity for obstetrical care providers. Inconsistencies among the professional society recommendations have caused confusion and disparities in practice. As we work to responsibly incorporate new technologies, clear guidelines with consensus among relevant professional societies are needed. In January of 2017, a workshop was convened during the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Pregnancy Meeting. Representatives from many stakeholder groups were present with the goal to develop a framework for introduction of new genetic tests into clinical practice. This paper provides consensus recommendations from this workshop on the use of existing prenatal screening and diagnostic testing for aneuploidy.

### Creation of a national, at-home model for ashkenazi jewish carrier screening [^a6bad1f2]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2015). Low credibility.

Ethnicity-based carrier screening for the Ashkenazi Jewish population has been available and encouraged by advocacy and community groups since the early 1970's. Both the American College of Medical Genetics and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend carrier screening for this population (Obstetrics and Gynecology, 114(4), 950–953, 2009; Genetics in Medicine, 10(1), 55–56, 2008). While many physicians inquire about ethnic background and offer appropriate carrier screening, studies show that a gap remains in implementing recommendations (Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers, 2011). In addition, education and outreach efforts targeting Jewish communities have had limited success in reaching this at-risk population. Despite efforts by the medical and Jewish communities, many Jews of reproductive age are not aware of screening, and remain at risk for having children with preventable diseases. Reaching this population, preferably pre-conception, and facilitating access to screening is critically important. To address this need, genetic counselors at Emory University developed JScreen, a national Jewish genetic disease screening program. The program includes a national marketing and PR campaign, online education, at-home saliva-based screening, post-test genetic counseling via telephone or secure video conferencing, and referrals for face-to-face genetic counseling as needed. Our goals are to create a successful education and screening program for this population and to develop a model that could potentially be used for other at-risk populations.

### ACOG committee opinion. number 298, August 2004. prenatal and preconceptional carrier screening for genetic diseases in individuals of Eastern European jewish descent [^a5c64e6e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Certain autosomal recessive disease conditions are more prevalent in individuals of Eastern European Jewish (Ashkenazi) descent. Previously, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended that individuals of Eastern European Jewish ancestry be offered carrier screening for Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan disease, and cystic fibrosis as part of routine obstetric care. Based on the criteria used to justify offering carrier screening for Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan disease, and cystic fibrosis, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Committee on Genetics recommends that couples of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry also should be offered carrier screening for familial dysautonomia. Individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent may inquire about the availability of carrier screening for other disorders. Carrier screening is available for mucolipidosis IV Niemann-Pick disease type A, Fanconi anemia group C, Bloom syndrome, and Gaucher's disease.

### Decision-making for prenatal genetic screening: how will pregnant women navigate a growing number of aneuploidy and carrier screening options? [^d7c64b5d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study highlights the challenges that prenatal genetic screening presents for both pregnant patients and their obstetric healthcare providers. Our findings raise important clinical and ethical questions about how best to ensure that patients can make autonomous, informed decisions about their screening options. That includes not only ensuring that patients have the information and resources they need to make decisions about those options, but also understanding patients' needs and values in the process so that the final decision best reflects their goals.

While knowledge levels for both kinds of screening were low at baseline, participants had greater familiarity with AS at the onset of prenatal care compared to CS. Knowledge deficits were noted across several informational categories, including the conditions contained in these screenings, the risk factors for a fetus being diagnosed with chromosomal or genomic variant, the interpretation of screen results, and the implications of those risk assessments on their pregnancy and future reproductive decision-making. In many regards, these findings were expected. Prior studies have demonstrated patient knowledge deficits and challenges for informed decision-making for prenatal AS factors have persisted despite the continued growth of cfDNA screening. Other studies have demonstrated deficits in patient knowledge and decision-making for CS. While some of these are due to patient-related factors, others are due to healthcare-related factors, including impediments in provider knowledge and adherence to evidence-based guidelines about their use.

Our findings indicate that it will require significant time and effort for healthcare providers to overcome the patients' deficits in knowledge. This is problematic, given that providers have increasingly less time during clinical encounters to engage in lengthy conversations. These results point to the increasing workload required at the first prenatal visit to ensure patients are prepared to make informed prenatal genetic screens decisions. Ideally, prenatal genetic screening options should be offered at the onset of prenatal care. While final decisions about the use of prenatal genetic screens may not be made at the initiation of prenatal care, the counseling that occurs at this time sets the stage for patients' informed access to genetic information about the pregnancy. In reality, these discussions do not occur in isolation, but during the time at which other important aspects of prenatal healthcare delivery must be discussed (e.g. the role of folic acid, immunization), with the addition of significant topical issues (e.g. COVID-19). These factors affect how much time and effort can be allocated during this visit to support patients' understanding of screening and diagnostic testing options and the implications of their choices on the outcome of the pregnancy.

### Screening and diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus: critical appraisal of the new international association of diabetes in pregnancy study group recommendations on a national level [^ff4accde]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with a high risk of immediate and late adverse outcomes for mothers and their offspring. This risk correlates with the level of maternal hyperglycemia, and glucose-lowering interventions were reported to decrease the risk of some of these adverse outcomes.

In many countries, including Israel, a two-step approach for GDM screening is used: pregnant women undergo a 50-g oral glucose challenge test, followed by a 100-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for women who test positive on the first test. This practice is based on little evidence. Furthermore, the glucose thresholds used for GDM diagnosis have been set according to maternal risk of later developing type 2 diabetes rather than the immediate risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

The Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) prospective study addressed the debate about the best screening practice and diagnostic criteria for GDM. Of 25,505 pregnant women recruited, 3,345 were from Israel. The results showed an association between fasting and postload plasma glucose levels and adverse pregnancy outcomes, even in the range previously considered normal. These results motivated the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group (IADPSG) to recommend a new screening practice and diagnostic criteria for GDM.

The yield and practicality of screening methods may differ according to prevalence of risk factors and availability of health care resources. The current analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of endorsing the IADPSG recommendations in Israel and to explore alternative methods for detecting women at risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes.

### Genetic screening for autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation in an isolated population in Israel [^48e0ed51]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2007). Low credibility.

Nonsyndromic mental retardation (NSMR) is the diagnosis of exclusion in mentally retarded individuals without additional abnormalities. We have recently identified a protein-truncating mutation, G408fsX437, in the gene CC2D1A on chromosome 19p13.12 in nine consanguineous Israeli Arab families with severe autosomal recessive NSMR, and have developed a comprehensive prevention program among the at-risk population in the village. The subjects tested were healthy women who were invited to undergo the genetic screening test as a part of their routine pregnancy monitoring. One hundred and seventeen subjects reported a family history positive for mental retardation. We tested 524 pregnant or preconceptional women and found 47 carriers (approximately 1/11), whose spouses were then recommended to undergo testing. We identified eight carrier couples, who were given genetic counseling and offered prenatal diagnosis. Of all the marriages, 28.6% were consanguineous; 16.5% of the total were between first cousins. The high prevalence of the mutation can be explained both by the founder effect owing to the generally high consanguinity rate among the inhabitants of the village, and also because two families with excessive numbers of mentally retarded offspring were unacceptable as marriage partners by the rest of the families. This is the first example of the establishment of a large-scale genetic screening program for autosomal recessive NSMR, which was made possible owing to the high frequency of the specific causative mutation in this isolated population.

Carrier screening for cystic fibrosis — when both partners are unaffected but one or both has a family history of cystic fibrosis, "Genetic counseling and medical record review should be performed to determine if CFTR mutation analysis in the affected family member is available" and "Carrier screening should be offered for both partners, with attention to ensure that the familial mutation is included in the assessment"; when "A woman's reproductive partner has cystic fibrosis or apparently isolated congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens," "The couple should be provided follow-up genetic counseling by an obstetrician–gynecologist or other health care provider with expertise in genetics"; and if "An individual has two cystic fibrosis mutations but has not previously received a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis," the individual "should be referred to a specialist for further evaluation" and "Genetic counseling is recommended." Program scope notes that "All states include cystic fibrosis screening as part of their newborn screening panel," yet "newborn screening panels do not replace preconception or prenatal carrier screening" and "a negative result in an unaffected newborn provides no information about the carrier status of the parents," so screening "continues to be offered to women who are considering pregnancy or are currently pregnant."

### Expanding families: a pilot study on preconception expanded carrier screening in Bahrain [^71cb6619]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Efforts are being made to implement ECS in clinical practice. As a case in point, the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) recommends ECS to all individuals considering reproduction and all pregnant reproductive pairs. Furthermore, a tiered approach is recommended based on risk assessment, with specifics determined by two prominent organizations: the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). A key aspect addressed by these recommendations and relevant to the populations of Middle Eastern countries is consanguinity. Genetic counseling is recommended for consanguineous couples (second cousins or closer), followed by Tier 4 screening, the most comprehensive panel that screens for conditions with a carrier frequency below 1/200. The consensus is that the optimal timing for ECS should be preconception, allowing ample time for reproductive decisions and subsequent interventions. For couples, it can be conducted either successively or simultaneously, with the latter being favored in the event of an ongoing pregnancy. From an ethical and social standpoint, it is imperative to provide appropriate pre- and post-testing genetic counseling and psychosocial support to aid the couples in weighing the pros and cons of being tested and handling the consequences of the results.

Consanguineous marriages are prevalent in the Middle East region including the Gulf countries and are known to contribute to genetic disorders, particularly AR disorders. In Bahrain, spanning a decade from 1990 to 2009, a decline in the prevalence of first-cousin marriages was witnessed, plummeting from 24% to nearly 7%. The most prevailing genetic disorders among Arabs include hemoglobinopathies, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, and some metabolic disorders. Concerning carrier genetic profiling, our research uncovered no recent studies specifically addressing this subject in Bahrain. Premarital screening was introduced in Bahrain in 1985. By 2004, the legislation mandated premarital genetic counseling through primary health centers, with particular emphasis on identifying hemoglobinopathy carriers. Despite the mandatory testing, couples retain the autonomy to decide whether to follow the genetic advice provided, resulting in some proceeding with the marriage despite genetic risks. It is worth noting that premarital screening is achieved by biochemical testing through hemoglobin electrophoresis, followed by genetic counseling referral and genetic testing, if indicated.

This study aims to identify the carrier genetic status of couples facing or anticipating conception challenges through NGS-based ECS and gain an overview of the rare genetic disorder carrier frequency in a population with increased consanguinity.

### Sex selection for social purposes in Israel: quest for the "perfect child" of a particular gender or centuries old prejudice against women? [^f7aaab41]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2008). Low credibility.

On 9 May 2005, the Israeli Ministry of Health issued guidelines spelling out the conditions under which sex selection by preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for social purposes is to be permitted in Israel. This article first reviews the available medical methods for sex selection, the preference for children of a specific gender in various societies and the ethical controversies surrounding PGD for medical and social purposes in different countries. It focuses then on the question of whether procreative liberty or parental responsibility should be the centre of attention in this context. Finally, the article critically examines the new Israeli guidelines and their implications for the women undergoing the necessary medical treatments, for the children born as a result, for other members of the family and for society in general.

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^e3ef2423]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Tay–Sachs disease — carrier frequencies and who should be offered screening — notes that the Ashkenazi Jewish carrier rate is "approximately 1 in 30," non-Jewish is "1 in 300," and French–Canadian/Cajun is "approximately 1 in 50." Screening "should be offered when considering pregnancy or during pregnancy if either member of a couple is of Ashkenazi Jewish, French–Canadian, or Cajun descent," and those with a consistent family history "also should be offered screening." If only one partner is high risk, "the high-risk partner should be offered screening," and if found to be a carrier, "the other partner also should be offered screening." When done as part of pan-ethnic expanded carrier screening, recognize limitations for general-population detection, and "expanded carrier screening panels are not the best approach to screening unless the familial mutation is included on the panel."

### Carrier screening for gaucher disease: lessons for low-penetrance, treatable diseases [^15691040]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

The aim of carrier screening is to prevent severe, untreatable genetic disease by identifying couples at risk before the birth of an affected child, and providing such couples with options for reproductive outcomes for affected pregnancies. Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive storage disorder, relatively frequent in Ashkenazi Jews. Carrier screening for GD is controversial because common type 1 GD is often asymptomatic and effective treatment exists. However, screening is offered to Ashkenazi Jews worldwide and has been offered in Israel since 1995.

Objective

To examine the scope and outcomes of nationwide GD screening.

Design, Setting, and Participants

All Israeli genetic centers provided data on the number of individuals screened for GD, the number of carriers identified, the number of carrier couples identified, and the mutations identified in these couples between January 1, 1995, and March 31, 2003. Carrier couples were interviewed via telephone between January 21, 2003, and August 31, 2004, using a structured questionnaire for relevant outcome measures.

Main Outcome Measures

Screening scope (number of testing centers, tested individuals, and carrier couples), screening process (type of pretest and posttest consultations), and screening outcomes (utilization of prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy terminations).

Results

Between January 1, 1995, and March 31, 2003, 10 of 12 Israeli genetic centers (83.3%) offered carrier screening. Carrier frequency was 5.7%, and 83 carrier couples were identified among an estimated 28,893 individuals screened. There were 82 couples at risk for offspring with type 1 GD. Seventy of 82 couples (85%) were at risk for asymptomatic or mildly affected offspring and 12 of 82 couples (15%) were at risk for moderately affected offspring. At postscreening, 65 interviewed couples had 90 pregnancies, and prenatal diagnosis was performed in 68 pregnancies (76%), detecting 16 fetuses with GD (24%). Pregnancies were terminated in 2 of 13 fetuses (15%) predicted to be asymptomatic or mildly affected and 2 of 3 fetuses (67%) with predicted moderate disease. There were significantly fewer pregnancy terminations in couples who in addition to genetic counseling had medical counseling with a GD expert (1 of 13 [8%] vs 3 of 3 with no medical counseling [100%], P = 0.007).

Conclusions

In this study of GD screening among Ashkenazi Jewish couples in Israel, most couples did not terminate affected pregnancies, although screening was associated with a few pregnancy terminations. The main possible benefit was providing couples with knowledge and control. The divergence of these outcomes from stated goals of screening programs is likely to confront carrier screening programs for low-penetrance diseases.

### Responsible implementation of expanded carrier screening [^852536ff]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Basic concepts of carrier screening

Carrier screening is defined here as a type of medical investigation to detect whether or not carrier status for a recessive disorder is present in a couple or a person, who does not have an a priori increased risk of being a carrier based on their or their partners' personal or family disease history. Carrier screening offered before or during pregnancy determines a couple's risk of having a child with a recessive inherited disorder, thereby facilitating reproductive choices for those at a high risk of having a child with a serious genetic disorder. Identifying carriers of either autosomal recessive or X-linked disorders has the potential to benefit prospective parents. When both partners are identified carriers of the same autosomal recessive disease, they have a one in four risk in each pregnancy of having a child affected by this disease. For X-linked disorders, half of the male offspring of a carrier mother will typically be affected. In this document we define 'carrier couples' as couples at risk of having offspring with an autosomal recessive or X-linked disorder.

Carrier screening can be considered at different life stages, for example, by individuals or couples before pregnancy (preconception carrier screening) or even before relationships commence (premarital, or pre-relationship carrier screening, for example, high-school screening), and by women during pregnancy and their partners (prenatal carrier screening). There are advantages and disadvantages to screening at each particular stage. For example, although prenatal screening is considered the most practical since pregnant women generally come to medical attention, the preconception period might be considered better timing with regard to the primary aim of screening because it results in more reproductive options being available besides prenatal diagnosis – thus in maximizing meaningful choices–including preimplantation genetic diagnosis (embryo selection), use of non-carrier donor sperm and/or oocytes, refraining from pregnancy or adoption. Furthermore, in some cultures, where the focus of screening is on spouse/partner selection or carrier matching, changing the choice of partner to prevent disease is an option.

Expanded carrier screening panel inclusion — the disorders selected for inclusion should meet several of the following consensus-determined criteria: have a carrier frequency of 1 in 100 or greater, have a well-defined phenotype, have a detrimental effect on quality of life, cause cognitive or physical impairment, require surgical or medical intervention, or have an onset early in life. Additionally, screened conditions should be able to be diagnosed prenatally and may afford opportunities for antenatal intervention to improve perinatal outcomes, changes to delivery management to optimize newborn and infant outcomes, and education of the parents about special care needs after birth, and carrier screening panels should not include conditions primarily associated with a disease of adult onset.

### ACOG committee opinion number 287, October 2003: newborn screening [^894a7419]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Newborn screening programs have enormous public health benefits and have been effective in identifying newborns who can benefit from early treatment. Because of advances in genetics and technology, newborn screening programs are capable of testing for more than 30 disorders, including infections, genetic diseases, and inherited and metabolic disorders. Many important issues surround the debate on universal screening, including financial resources, level of screening, continuity of care, and informed consent. To date, policy on newborn screening has been fragmented; however, efforts are underway to ensure uniformity and equity for all newborns. Obstetrician-gynecologists can continue to work to improve the health of their patients by informing expectant families of the newborn screening process.

### Committee opinion no. 690: carrier screening in the age of genomic medicine [^50d84d39]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Carrier screening strategies and practice approach — ethnic-specific, panethnic, and expanded carrier screening are acceptable strategies for pregnancy and preconception carrier screening, and in the past, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has advocated for ethnic-based screening. Expanded carrier screening panels offered by laboratories typically include options to screen from 5–10 conditions to as many as several hundred conditions, and traditionally, panethnic screening has been defined as making screening for specific recommended conditions available to all patients, regardless of ethnic or racial background; this approach largely has been supplanted by expanded carrier screening because of its efficiency and economy. Because all of these are acceptable strategies, each obstetrician–gynecologist or other health care provider or practice should establish a standard approach that is consistently offered to and discussed with each patient, ideally before pregnancy, and if a patient requests a screening strategy other than the one used by the obstetrician–gynecologist or other health care provider, the requested test should be made available to her after counseling on its limitations, benefits, and alternatives; couples with consanguinity should be offered genetic counseling to discuss the increased risk of recessive conditions being expressed in their offspring and the limitations and benefits of carrier screening.

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^b44769cb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis — screening considerations and management — states that cystic fibrosis carrier screening should be offered to all women who are considering pregnancy or are currently pregnant, and if the patient is a carrier then her partner should be tested; during pregnancy, concurrent screening of the patient and her partner is suggested when there are time constraints for decisions regarding prenatal diagnostic evaluation. Given that cystic fibrosis screening has been a routine part of reproductive care for women since 2001, it is prudent to determine if the patient has been previously screened before ordering repeat screening; if previously screened, results should be documented and the test should not be repeated, and before repeat testing the clinical scenario should be discussed with an obstetrician–gynecologist or other health care provider with expertise in genetics. Scenario-based recommendations include: when a woman is a carrier and her partner is unavailable for testing or paternity is unknown, genetic counseling is recommended; when prenatal diagnosis is being performed for other indications and carrier status is unknown, cystic fibrosis screening can be performed concurrently on the patient and partner, chorionic villi or amniocytes may be maintained in culture until results are available, and if both partners are carriers, diagnostic testing for cystic fibrosis can be performed on the chorionic villi or amniocytes; when both partners are cystic fibrosis carriers, genetic counseling is recommended and prenatal diagnosis should be offered for the couple's specific, known mutations.

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^09e8fc1c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis — cystic fibrosis carrier screening should be offered to all women who are considering pregnancy or are currently pregnant. Complete analysis of the CFTR gene by DNA sequencing is not appropriate for routine carrier screening. For couples in which both partners are unaffected but one or both has a family history of cystic fibrosis, genetic counseling and medical record review should be performed to determine if CFTR mutation analysis in the affected family member is available. If a woman's reproductive partner has cystic fibrosis or apparently isolated congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, the couple should be provided follow-up genetic counseling by an obstetrician–gynecologist or other health care provider with expertise in genetics for mutation analysis and consultation.

### Do people from the jewish community prefer ancestry-based or pan-ethnic expanded carrier screening? [^e94d349e]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

How carrier screening should be offered

Most respondents thought that carrier screening should best be offered preconceptionally (29.9%), premaritally (24.1%), or to students (17.2%). Other options mentioned regarding timing were prenatal (14.9%), high school students (6.6%), new-born screening (3.4%), and other (3.7%). Hospitals (25.9%), GPs (24.6%), and midwifery practices (15.3%) were mentioned as the most appropriate settings for offering carrier screening, followed by Dor Yeshorim (14.3%), the rabbi (6.3%), Internet (5.0%), Jewish high schools (4.8%), or other (3.4%). The majority of the respondents (57.3%) were willing to pay 100–500 euros for screening, 25.5% were willing to pay < 100 euros, whereas 17.1% were willing to pay > 500 euros. Nevertheless, 57.9% thought that the costs should be reimbursed. Almost half of the respondents (46.2%) preferred only to be informed of their status as a couple, whereas 38.6% preferred full disclosure of their individual test results; 9.7% had no preference, and 3.5% thought it should be a couple's choice in deciding how to receive the test results. Orthodox Jews did not more often want to receive the test results as a couple compared with liberal Jews, χ 2 (1) = 1.20, P = 0.27. In addition, no significant differences in preference were found between people from the reproductive age group (18–45 years) and people older than 46 years χ 2 (1) = 2.99, P = 0.08.

### Committee opinion no. 690: carrier screening in the age of genomic medicine [^0962b15c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Carrier screening counseling and partner testing — if a woman is found to be a carrier for a specific condition, her reproductive partner should be offered screening to provide accurate genetic counseling for the couple with regard to the risk of having an affected child. Additional genetic counseling should be provided to discuss the specific condition, residual risk, and options for prenatal testing, and if a carrier couple (ie, carriers for the same condition) is identified before pregnancy, genetic counseling is encouraged so that reproductive options (eg, donor gametes, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, prenatal diagnosis) can be discussed. Individuals with a family history of a genetic disorder may benefit from the identification of the specific familial mutation or mutations rather than carrier screening, and knowledge of the specific familial mutation may allow for more specific and rapid prenatal diagnosis. Prenatal carrier screening does not replace newborn screening, nor does newborn screening diminish the potential benefit of prenatal carrier screening, and screening for any condition is optional and, after counseling, a patient may decline any or all carrier screening.

### Changing trends in carrier screening for genetic disease in the United States [^7dc4e7f9]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Screening for genetic disease has been a long established part of preconception and prenatal care. One model for carrier screening has been the community wide screening programs for Tay–Sachs disease (TSD) established in the 1970s. 2 These programs focused on a single severe disease that had an increased carrier frequency in a recognized ethnic group, Eastern European Ashkenazi Jews. Wide implementation of these programs has significantly reduced the incidence of TSD in this ethnic group, with the majority of affected infants currently being from other ethnic groups.

Another disorder that has been widely screened for is cystic fibrosis (CF). It has been over a decade since the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) initiated guidelines for prenatal and preconception carrier screening of cystic fibrosis. Initial guidelines recommended screening Caucasian individuals or those with a family history of cystic fibrosis. In April 2011, the ACOG Committee on Genetics updated their CF screening guidelines, stating that it has become increasingly difficult to classify individuals with CF into distinct ethnic categories. 3 The Committee agreed that it is reasonable to offer CF to all couples planning a pregnancy because it allows them to consider all reproductive options, including pre‐implantation genetic diagnosis, prenatal diagnosis, gamete donation, or adoption.

Given the long history of carrier screening, there are still relatively few guidelines available to providers, resulting in inconsistent practices. In addition, there are conflicting recommendations among organizations (ACOG, ACMG) that have published guidelines. Both organizations recommend screening for cystic fibrosis, Ashkenazi Jewish disorders, and Tay–Sachs disease but ACMG list more disorders on its 'Jewish' panel. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ACOG also recommends ethnicity‐based screening for hemoglobinopathies. 8 Only ACMG recommends screening for spinal muscular atrophy. 9 Neither organization recommends screening for fragile X syndrome, unless the family history suggests it or the patient specifically requests it. 10, 11

Outside of the United States guidelines are more limited. Australia supports universal screening for cystic fibrosis carriers in pregnancy, while guidelines in Canada and United Kingdom do not support this approach. 12, 13, 14 These guidelines are in part driven by cost considerations, and the current availability of cost‐effective gene panels suggests the need to revisit the way screening is offered to patients.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 442: preconception and prenatal carrier screening for genetic diseases in individuals of Eastern European jewish descent [^dd208ab8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Certain autosomal recessive disease conditions are more prevalent in individuals of Eastern European Jewish (Ashkenazi) descent. Previously, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended that individuals of Eastern European Jewish ancestry be offered carrier screening for Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan disease, and cystic fibrosis as part of routine obstetric care. Based on the criteria used to justify offering carrier screening for Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan disease, and cystic fibrosis, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Committee on Genetics recommends that couples of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry also should be offered carrier screening for familial dysautonomia. Individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent may inquire about the availability of carrier screening for other disorders. Carrier screening is available for mucolipidosis IV, Niemann-Pick disease type A, Fanconi anemia group C, Bloom syndrome, and Gaucher disease.

Administrative

A clear, unambiguous identification of the examination is needed, this could be the title of the report but not necessarily.

The identity of the laboratory performing the analysis and issuing the report, with full contact details (including phone number). If parts of analyses have been carried out in other laboratories, this fact must be clearly and unequivocally stated.

Full date of when the report is authorised.

Electronic reports may be issued but page numbers indicating the total number of pages must be included when reports can be printed. This is essential when multiple pages are used (e.g. 1/1 or page 1 of 2) and unique patient identification must be provided on each page (see Patient identification section).

Name and full address (including phone number) of the requester / the physician referring the patient.

The report must be electronically or manually signed by the authorized specialist individual who validated the analysis and interpreted the result; co-validation and co-signature by a second competent person is recommended (and mandatory in some countries). The name and function of signatories must be given.

In order to avoid errors and/or misinterpretation, transcription of all or part of this report is inadvisable. It is recommended to add a standard phrase indicating that "this report may not be copied or reproduced, except in totality".

Patient identification

There must be clear identification of the patient since this is a crucial element through the whole process of care delivery. As a minimum, this should include:
Full given name(s)
Surname
Unequivocal date of birth and/or personal identification code

The gender of the patient should be stated.

Foetal samples (chorionic villi samples, amniocytes etc.) should be clearly identifiable and reported as unique individuals, with reference to the mother's identification. The date of sample may be used to identify separate pregnancies and separate samples from the same foetus.

Where legislation (e.g. data protection legislation) prohibits the transmission of identifiable personal information, a code may be used instead of the patient's name.

Ethnic/geographic origin, if relevant.

Patient identifications should be included on each page of a multi-page report.

### Changing trends in carrier screening for genetic disease in the United States [^63c7faba]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2015). Low credibility.

Timing of Carrier Screening

Preconception genetic screening is not a new concept and has been a vital part of the Jewish community since the 1970s, and as a part of the Dor Yeshorim program since the 1980s. 26 These programs have significantly reduced the incidence of Tay–Sachs disease in Jewish babies. Many well‐recognized Jewish organizations, such as the Jewish Genetic Disease Consortium (JGDC), JScreen.org, and the Center for Jewish Genetics recommend complete screening for all individuals of Jewish heritage in a timely manner. In fact, rabbi education programs encourage carrier screening of young Jewish couples during premarital counseling. 27 Focusing on the cultural needs of the Jewish community, these organizations endorse screening for larger disease panels, as opposed to the currently recommended ACOG panel of four, or ACMG panel of 9. This is because while carrier status for each individual Jewish genetic condition is rare, a study conducted by Mount Sinai Laboratory found the overall carrier rate for at least one condition on their 16‐disease Ashkenazi Jewish panel is at least 30%. 28 Similarly, as expanded screening panels become readily available to the general population, the incidence of each individual disease will be rare, but the collective population risk approaches and may even exceed 20%.

### Responsible implementation of expanded carrier screening [^511ca6ab]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

In 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) published a position statement outlining the important issues related to prenatal/preconception expanded carrier screening. The more extensive joint statement of the ACMG, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists (ACOG), National Society of Genetic Counselors, Perinatal Quality Foundation, and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine in 2015suggests, among others, the components of consent for expanded carrier screening, information related to post-counselling, criteria for conditions to be included on expanded carrier panels, recommendations related to interpretation of molecular findings, as well as needs for further data collection and research.

This paper: (a) reflects on these new challenges in the context of lessons learnt from several decades of population-based carrier screening, (b) contributes to the public and professional discussion on expanded carrier screening, (c) contributes to the development of clinical and laboratory guidelines, and (d) provides recommendations for health care policy and professionals. The paper was prepared by members of the PPPC of the ESHG and recommendations were posted on the ESHG website from 4 February 2015 to 15 March 2015, for membership consultation and comments from external experts. The final version was approved by the ESHG Board on 6 September 2015, and also endorsed by the BSGM Board. This document starts with an outline of attitudes of health care professionals and the public towards carrier screening, followed by an overview of carrier tests currently available and discussed against the Analytic validity, Clinical validity, Clinical utility, Ethical, legal and social implications (ACCE) Framework, and ends with (consensus) recommendations.

### The prevalence, genetic complexity and population-specific founder effects of human autosomal recessive disorders [^1989755a]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Carrier screening for recessive disorders constitutes a well-established public health measure that has substantially decreased the burden of a variety of diseases, particularly in individuals belonging to certain genetic risk groups or with family history of genetic disease. Notable examples of the success of such screening programs when combined with pretest and posttest genetic counseling include the reduction of β-thalassemia (OMIM 613985) cases in Greece and Italy by 80–90% (ref.), and the diminishing of Tay–Sachs disease by ~90% in Ashkenazi Jews in the US and Israel. Such population-scale genetic testing strategies require that the molecular genetics of the disease are understood and that carrier frequencies in the targeted population are well approximated.

Population-scale genetic screening relies on the interrogation of candidate variants, whereas sequencing is generally restricted to diagnostic applications. For instance, carrier screening for cystic fibrosis involves the testing of 23 CFTR variants, according to recommendations by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American College of Medical Geneticists (ACMG). However, this test panel can only explain ~80% of cystic fibrosis cases, suggesting that rare non-tested genetic variation can have considerable impact on disease risk. Furthermore, very limited information on disease epidemiology and population specificity is available for most Mendelian disorders. Combined, this lack of data hampers studies of AR disease genetics and impedes the implementation of genetic screening programs for the majority of AR diseases. By integrating population-scale sequencing data of > 140,000 individuals with a curated disease genetics knowledgebase and stringent computational analyses, we provide a comprehensive map of the human genetic AR disease landscape that considers both established pathogenic variants, as well as rare and novel variants with unknown pathogenicity. Based on the identified 46,935 pathogenic variants, we calculated disease prevalence and confidence intervals for 450 AR diseases, substantially extending previous prevalence estimates based on genomic data that only considered few selected diseases or gene families –.

### The evolving landscape of expanded carrier screening: challenges and opportunities [^4cca58b6]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Carrier screening programs were introduced in the 1970s to offer individuals the opportunity to learn the likelihood that they could pass on an autosomal or X-linked condition to their offspring. Initially, carrier screening programs were used only with ethnic groups who had relatively high incidence of certain conditions, such as ancestry-based screening for Tay–Sachs disease in Ashkenazi Jewish communities and β-thalassemia in Mediterranean populations. After the 1989 identification of the gene associated with cystic fibrosis (CF), CF screening became available, and by the late 1990s the professional consensus was that it should be offered to all individuals or couples seeking prenatal or preconception care. Subsequently, several professional guidance documents have been issued in support of pan-ethnic CF screening. – This move has been motivated in part by the difficulty of assigning individuals to a single ethnicity and determining who is at risk for ancestry-based screening, and to provide more equitable access to carrier screening services. Throughout the past decade, it has become increasingly common to offer carrier screening to the general preconception and prenatal populations. – For example, in some parts of the world, pan-ethnic screening is common for hemoglobinopathies and thalassemias, and it has recently been recommended for conditions such as spinal muscular atrophy – and fragile X syndrome.

Carrier screening timing and partner management — prepregnancy carrier screening is ideal because it provides patients with the opportunity to learn their carrier status and allows partners to discover if both are carriers before pregnancy; if a woman is found to be a carrier, her reproductive partner should be offered screening, and additional genetic counseling should be provided to discuss the specific condition, residual risk, and prenatal testing options; if a carrier couple is identified before pregnancy, genetic counseling is encouraged so that reproductive options can be discussed.

### Screening for autosomal recessive and X-linked conditions during pregnancy and preconception: a practice resource of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^5732ab80]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Carrier screening began 50 years ago with screening for conditions that have a high prevalence in defined racial/ethnic groups (e.g. Tay-Sachs disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population; sickle cell disease in Black individuals). Cystic fibrosis was the first medical condition for which panethnic screening was recommended, followed by spinal muscular atrophy. Next-generation sequencing allows low cost and high throughput identification of sequence variants across many genes simultaneously. Since the phrase "expanded carrier screening" is nonspecific, there is a need to define carrier screening processes in a way that will allow equitable opportunity for patients to learn their reproductive risks using next-generation sequencing technology. An improved understanding of this risk allows patients to make informed reproductive decisions. Reproductive decision making is the established metric for clinical utility of population-based carrier screening. Furthermore, standardization of the screening approach will facilitate testing consistency. This practice resource reviews the current status of carrier screening, provides answers to some of the emerging questions, and recommends a consistent and equitable approach for offering carrier screening to all individuals during pregnancy or preconception.

Results

Sample characteristics

In total, 266 respondents (all ≥ 18 years) responded, the majority of whom (n = 166, 62.4%) completed all questions (Figure 1). It was not possible to trace via which of the four recruitment methods the respondents were included. Twenty-four people were initially excluded because of their non-Jewish ancestral background. Three of them, however, were in a relationship with a Jewish partner and were therefore included, resulting in a study sample of 145 respondents. People who fully completed the questionnaire had more often heard about carrier testing before they received the questionnaire than people who did not complete the questionnaire ('non-completers') (85.3% versus 54.7%, respectively, χ 2 (1) = 5.52, P < 0.05). As 'non-completers' did not fill out the questions about socio-demographic variables, no comparison in characteristics between respondents and 'non-completers' could be made.

Characteristics of respondents (n = 145) are presented in Table 2. The majority were female (70.3%) with a mean age of 43 (range 18–87; SD = 15.1). The mean age of the male respondents was 52 (range 20–76; SD = 17.5). In total, 59.3% identified themselves as orthodox, either ultra or modern, and of all respondents, > 85% were somewhat to very religiously active. Of all respondents with a partner (n = 112), 47.4% (n = 53) were considering a future pregnancy. Sixteen percent (n = 23) had already been tested, of whom 11 were tested in Israel (10 by Dor Yeshorim), seven in the Netherlands, three in the US, one in the UK, and one in Greece. Finally, 64.8% had heard about carrier screening before receiving the questionnaire, and 41% knew someone with a severe genetic disease, not necessarily a genetic disease more common in the Jewish community.

### The clinical utility of DNA-based screening for fetal aneuploidy by primary obstetrical care providers in the general pregnancy population [^b88d8e6c]. Genetics in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Surveys of screened women

The test requisitions of two-thirds of women (Table 2) included permission to be contacted (an institutional review board requirement); a pool of 140 was selected. Seven phone numbers were incorrect or out of service, and contact was unsuccessful for another 20. Of the remaining 113 women, 100 (88%) completed the 15-min survey after providing verbal consent. Interviews occurred 3 to 5 months after testing, but all women were still pregnant. This time frame was chosen to ensure that participants had completed all decision making about screening and follow-up prior to being contacted.

A complete list of responses to selected questions is shown in Table 3. Women reported receiving information from their physician or certified nurse midwife (55%) or an office nurse/educator (40%) in less than 5 min (36%) or in 5 to 9 min (39%). They reported sufficient time to talk with their provider (95%), having their questions answered (96%), and feeling that the optional nature of screening was conveyed (99%). Although 85% understood that the test identified Down syndrome, 15% thought it identified all genetic problems. Most (79%) understood that a negative result did not rule out Down syndrome but 13% thought it did. Overall, 69% knew that "the test could not tell for certain if the baby has Down syndrome"; however, 28% thought it could. Women were not nervous about testing (mean, 2.4; 1 = not at all, 5 = very) and 93% rated their decision as "good" or "great" (mean, 4.2; 1 = terrible, 5 = great). Nearly all (97%) remembered reviewing DNA First results with office personnel, 98% would recommend testing to friends, and 95% said they would undergo the test in their next pregnancy. They reported a willingness to pay $10 to $50 (38%) or $51 to $100 (33%) out of pocket. Eighty-seven women remembered making decisions regarding sex chromosome trisomy screening/fetal sex. The 78 women who chose such screening wanted to know the baby's sex (77%), wanted as much information as possible (67%), and liked not being required to pay (47%). Of nine women who did not choose sex chromosome trisomy testing, eight did not want to know the fetal sex. Knowing fetal sex was "very important" for 46% and "not important for 34%"; 20% "did not want to know."

### Which BRCA genetic testing programs are ready for implementation in health care? A systematic review of economic evaluations [^862dafd1]. Genetics in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Evidence of cost-effectiveness

To aid interpretation, four main categories of the BRCA testing program were identified on the basis of target populations: (i) population-based genetic screening of individuals without cancer, either comprehensive or targeted based on ancestry or ethnicity; (ii) family history (FH)-based genetic screening, i.e. testing unaffected individuals with FH suggestive of BRCA mutation but in whom a familial mutation (FM) has not been identified; (iii) FM-based genetic screening, i.e. testing unaffected individuals with a known familial mutation; and (iv) cancer-based genetic screening, i.e. testing individuals with BRCA-related cancers to prevent the occurrence of further primary cancers (Table 3).

Population-based genetic screening. The broadest approach involves population-based genetic screening of individuals without cancer, either comprehensive or subpopulations. Three studies focused on a specific ethnic group, the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) communities in Israel, United States, and United Kingdom, and one program targeted the general population. Studies targeted at the AJ community included, as a routine genetic test, the " BRCA founder-mutation test,", which tests only three specific mutations in BRCA (BRCA1*185delAG, BRCA1*5382insC, and BRCA2*6174delT); these mutations account for ~95% of detectable BRCA mutations in dominantly inherited early-onset breast and ovarian cancer in families of AJ ancestry.

### Decision-making for prenatal genetic screening: how will pregnant women navigate a growing number of aneuploidy and carrier screening options? [^9720a42f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Prenatal genetic screening, comprising both aneuploidy screening (AS) and carrier screening (CS), is a core component of evidence-based obstetric healthcare delivery. However, it has become extremely difficult for pregnant women to navigate their prenatal genetic screening options in an informed fashion, for two reasons. First, advances in technology have greatly increased the number of screening options available to patients. Second, clinical practice guideline changes have led to a large increase in the number of patients offered these screens during pregnancy, specifically universal screening approaches that have expanded upon previous age-based or ethnicity-based screening approaches. Consequently, it is necessary now, more than ever, to develop effective approaches to ensure that patients can best make informed and preference-based decisions about their use.

One source of confusion for patients is that AS and CS provide different kinds of risk information about the impact of the identified variant on the pregnancy and future reproductive decision-making. AS focuses on identifying chromosomal aneuploidy (e.g. trisomy 21) and other genetic abnormalities such as microdeletions. In contrast, CS focuses on identifying heritable genetic mutations that are present in the pregnant woman and can be passed to the offspring. As conditions such as cystic fibrosis are heritable, the results of CS may impact decisions about the current pregnancy and any future reproductive decisions.

It is important to address this because previous studies have demonstrated that patients commonly struggle with understanding key informational aspects of both AS and CS and often lack the health literacy and numeracy skills to interpret and personalize the risk information generated by prenatal genetic screening. In addition, a significant number of patients do not present for preconception care and in doing so, miss the opportunity to take advantage of genetic screening for reproductive planning prior to pregnancy.

Given these challenges, we conducted a study to evaluate both patients' knowledge of prenatal genetic screening and their decision-making preferences for screening when offered as part of an expanded screening panel.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 778 — Newborn screening and obstetric care — states that newborn screening is a mandatory state-based public health program that provides all newborns in the United States with testing and necessary follow-up health care for a variety of medical conditions and is the largest genetic screening program in the United States, with approximately 4 million infants screened annually. All states and the District of Columbia have newborn screening programs with varying screening panels, policies, statutes, and regulations, and most programs have adopted the guidelines suggested by the Discretionary Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children. Obstetrician–gynecologists and other obstetric care providers should make resources about newborn screening available to patients during pregnancy, and information can be disseminated through informational brochures and electronic sources and through review or discussion at some time during prenatal care. However, parents or guardians can opt-out of the program for religious reasons following state guidelines. Newborn screening does not replace the potential value of carrier screening nor does carrier screening replace newborn screening, and the document includes updated information on the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) and recommendations for incorporating newborn screening into obstetric practice.

### Decision-making for prenatal genetic screening: how will pregnant women navigate a growing number of aneuploidy and carrier screening options? [^61e70ea7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

We recognize that issues related to patients' health literacy and knowledge with respect to prenatal genetic screening have been an ongoing clinical challenge. This situation calls for integrating innovative approaches, resources, and technological solutions as we reevaluate how to best support patients' informed decision-making about an expanding array of prenatal genetic screening options at the onset of prenatal care. For instance, patient engagement software is a new approach used in other areas of healthcare driven by patient preferences and needs. These types of programs can present information with decision aids and then, using the input of patients, respond and adapt to patient preferences and needs to provide more personalized education. Such an approach may reduce the challenges to condensing these processes in a single visit. In addition, using programming pathways, information delivery can be automated so that it can be delivered at different time points in prenatal care delivery. This would be an optimal approach to initiate decision-making once a pregnant patient schedules her initial prenatal visit and then at set times over the prenatal episode in conjunction with screening and diagnostic testing milestones. It would also help prepare patients to discuss their options with a genetic counselor by introducing them to genetic screening concepts in preparation for that visit. Further research is needed to determine how to integrate innovative approaches into prenatal care delivery to meet the challenges posed by genomics. This should include studies that seek to understand patients' goals and preferences, not only with prenatal genetic screening but also with the process that leads to the final decision to use or decline this option, a factor that will be critical with advances in screening technology.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for prenatal screening for chromosomal abnormalities, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, general principles, NSGC 2013 guidelines recommend to consider offering noninvasive prenatal testing to patients desiring screening information due to the high detection rates and low false positive rates. Offer noninvasive prenatal testing only in the context of informed consent, education, and counseling by a qualified provider, such as a genetic counselor. Obtain standard confirmatory diagnostic testing as a follow-up to positive noninvasive prenatal testing results. Inform of alternate screening options as appropriate based on gestational age and screening availability in high-risk patients declining noninvasive prenatal testing but remaining interested in screening.

### The Israeli national population program of genetic carrier screening for reproductive purposes [^2b7b2616]. Genetics in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The Israeli population genetic screening program for reproductive purposes, launched in January 2013, includes all known, nationally frequent severe diseases (carrier frequency 1:60 and/or disease frequency 1 in 15,000 live births). The carrier screening program is free of charge and offers testing for cystic fibrosis, fragile X syndrome, and spinal muscular atrophy for nearly the entire population, according to disease frequency among the different groups within the population. We report the results of the first year of the program.

Methods

Data on the tests performed over a 12-month period were collected from laboratories nationwide.

Results

More than 62,000 individuals were examined. The carrier frequency was within the expected range for most of the diseases. The few exceptions included lower carrier rates for cystic fibrosis among Muslim Arabs (1:236) and Druze (1:1,021) and Niemann-Pick type A among Muslim Arabs in a delineated region of Israel (1:229).

Conclusion

The national population genetic carrier screening is aimed toward providing couples with knowledge of the existing options for the prevention of serious genetic conditions when it is relevant for them. It is still too early to determine whether this aim has been achieved.

### Clinical experience with carrier screening in a general population: support for a comprehensive pan-ethnic approach [^6eaa42ed]. Genetics in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The landscape of prenatal and preconception carrier screening (CS) is rapidly changing. Compared with traditional genotyping methods, modern genetic screening technology using next-generation sequencing (NGS) has rapidly expanded disease screening options. Traditional prenatal and preconception CS targeted specific diseases with high prevalence, particularly in defined subpopulations. At present, CS for eight disorders (excluding cystic fibrosis [CF]) are recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) for individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) heritage. These professional guidelines also recommend pan-ethnic screening for CF and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and ACOG recommends pan-ethnic screening for hemoglobinopathies. – Though these guidelines target some of the most prevalent genetic disorders, they do not identify carriers for many common conditions of importance to the diverse subpopulations present in contemporary societies. Moreover, CS based on ethnicity and race is often untenable due to complex population admixture, multiethnic and multiracial populations, and missing or incorrect ethnic/racial information.

Modern genetic screening technology using NGS overcomes these limitations by expanding the number of diseases covered and applies the testing to whole populations. Exome and genome sequencing may further expand the scope of variants identified in the CS panels. Recognizing these benefits, ACOG and ACMG have endorsed offering expanded CS to couples who are considering pregnancy or are already pregnant, regardless of ethnicity. Several studies have demonstrated that CS identifies an increased number of fetuses at risk for severe phenotypes compared with that based on traditional professional screening guidelines. – Currently available expanded CS panels are extremely heterogeneous in panel size, with the number of diseases being screened ranging from 41 to 1556. A joint statement from the ACMG, ACOG, the National Society for Genetic Counselors (NSGC), Perinatal Quality Foundation (PQF), and the Society for Maternal–Fetal Medicine (SMFM) acknowledged the utility of more comprehensive, pan-ethnic CS and provides guidelines for the inclusion of disorders but does not give specifics regarding individual genes.

What is the preferred timing for screening?

There is widespread consensus among professional societies and most commenters that the ideal time to offer carrier screening is preconception, as this allows for more options (e.g. avoiding pregnancy or using advanced reproductive technologies to conceive) than does screening during a pregnancy. Additionally, current guidance documents suggest that screening of both individuals in a couple may take place either sequentially or concurrently, but concurrent screening may be recommended if there are time constraints that could limit the reproductive actionability of the results — for example, if screening is done during a pregnancy.

While preconception care is widely recognized as an important service, most women do not receive these services currently. In the United States, data from selected states indicate that only 33% of women with a recent live birth had a discussion with a health-care professional prior to their pregnancy about improving their health. A review of CF carrier screening studies found lower uptake of screening in the preconception setting than in prenatal care despite a general belief that preconception is the ideal timing, which the authors attributed to many individuals' lack of interest in screening prior to conception. For expanded carrier screening to be delivered as part of preconception care, couples would need to approach planning for pregnancy differently.
