## Question

A 26-year-old medical student comes to the physician for a chest x-ray to rule out active pulmonary tuberculosis. He needs a medical and radiological report before starting a medical internship in South Africa. He has no history of serious illness and does not complain of any symptoms. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 6 years. He does not drink alcohol. He is 190 cm (6 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 75 kg (165 lbs); BMI is 20.8 kg/m2. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 128/89 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The x-ray of the chest shows a small pneumothorax (rim of < 2 cm) between the upper left lung margin and the chest wall. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?
A. Emergent needle thoracostomy
B. Observation and follow-up x-ray
C. Immediate intubation and assisted ventilation
D. Urgent chest tube placement

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which management option is most appropriate for a 26-year-old man with a small, asymptomatic primary spontaneous pneumothorax found incidentally on a chest X-ray. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the pneumothorax and confirming stability. Then, I should verify what contemporary guidelines say about conservative management versus intervention based on symptoms and size. Next, I will review the evidence base supporting observation, including randomized data. After that, I need to check for any red flags that would push me toward immediate intervention. Finally, I will outline a practical follow-up plan and confirm why the alternatives are inappropriate, anchoring to BTS 2023, ERS/EACTS/ESTS 2024, and the RAMPP trial.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and classification. This is a primary spontaneous pneumothorax in a young, otherwise healthy adult, discovered incidentally on a chest X-ray, with a rim of less than 2 cm and no symptoms or physiologic compromise, which places him in a low-risk category for deterioration and makes conservative management reasonable [^96343c10] [^fc5460bf].

> Wait, let me verify the role of size versus symptoms in decision-making. I initially thought that any pneumothorax larger than 2 cm mandates intervention, but hold on, that's outdated. Current BTS and ERS/EACTS/ESTS guidelines emphasize that minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic primary spontaneous pneumothorax can be managed conservatively regardless of size, and that symptoms, not absolute size, should drive intervention decisions, so a small rim on X-ray alone is not an indication for drainage in a stable patient [^96343c10] [^fc5460bf].

> Next, I should review the evidence supporting observation. The RAMPP randomized trial showed that ambulatory management with a Heimlich valve was noninferior to standard care and reduced length of stay, and importantly, contemporary guideline statements endorse conservative management for selected minimally symptomatic patients, with BTS explicitly recommending observation for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic primary spontaneous pneumothorax regardless of size, and ERS/EACTS/ESTS similarly supporting conservative management in clinically and radiologically stable patients with minimal symptoms [^78e25b8f] [^96343c10] [^fc5460bf].

> I need to ensure there are no red flags that would change management. There is no evidence of tension physiology, no significant pain or dyspnea, no hemodynamic instability, and no known underlying lung disease, so emergent needle decompression, intubation, or urgent chest tube placement are not indicated here; these interventions are reserved for tension pneumothorax, respiratory failure, or unstable patients with large or progressive air leaks, which are not present in this case [^96343c10] [^fc5460bf].

> Let me consider the practical follow-up plan. I should confirm that the patient receives clear return precautions, abstains from smoking to reduce recurrence risk, and has a scheduled repeat chest X-ray in about 24 to 48 hours to document stability or resolution; if stable, many patients can be discharged with outpatient follow-up, and if there is any progression or new symptoms, then aspiration or chest tube can be considered per guideline pathways, noting that BTS supports ambulatory options where appropriate expertise exists [^96343c10] [^210e7522] [^fc5460bf].

> Hold on, I should verify why the other options are wrong. Emergent needle thoracostomy is for tension pneumothorax, which requires clinical signs of mediastinal shift and hemodynamic compromise, none of which are present here. Immediate intubation is not indicated in a stable, non-hypoxic patient and could worsen a small pneumothorax via positive pressure. Urgent chest tube placement is not warranted in an asymptomatic, stable primary spontaneous pneumothorax, as guidelines prioritize observation or less invasive options first in this phenotype [^96343c10] [^fc5460bf].

> Putting this together, the most appropriate next step is observation with a scheduled follow-up chest X-ray, given the small, asymptomatic primary spontaneous pneumothorax in a stable patient, aligning with BTS 2023 and ERS/EACTS/ESTS 2024 recommendations and supported by the RAMPP trial's ambulatory data, reserving intervention only if symptoms develop or the pneumothorax enlarges [^96343c10] [^fc5460bf] [^78e25b8f].

---

The most appropriate next step is **observation with a follow-up chest X-ray** because the patient has a small, asymptomatic primary spontaneous pneumothorax and is hemodynamically stable [^96343c10] [^fc5460bf]. Emergent interventions such as needle thoracostomy, intubation, or chest tube placement are not indicated in the absence of symptoms or instability [^96343c10]. Conservative management with observation and repeat imaging is supported by current guidelines and is associated with favorable outcomes in stable patients [^fc5460bf] [^9eb5ae89].

---

## Clinical assessment and risk stratification

The patient is a 26-year-old male with a small pneumothorax (rim < 2 cm) and no symptoms or signs of respiratory distress, hemodynamic instability, or tension pneumothorax. Key findings include:

- **Vital signs**: Stable (BP 128/89 mmHg, HR 80/min, RR 18/min, temp 37°C).
- **Physical examination**: Clear lungs, no signs of tension pneumothorax.
- **Pneumothorax size**: Small (< 2 cm rim), indicating a minor collapse.

Given these findings, the patient is at **low risk for complications**, and immediate invasive intervention is not indicated [^96343c10].

---

## Guideline-based management recommendations

Current guidelines from the British Thoracic Society (BTS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) provide clear recommendations for managing small, asymptomatic primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP):

- **BTS 2023 guidelines**: Recommend conservative management with observation and follow-up chest radiography for minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic PSP, regardless of size [^96343c10].
- **ERS/EACTS/ESTS 2024 guidelines**: Recommend conservative management for clinically and radiologically stable patients with minimal symptoms, regardless of pneumothorax size [^fc5460bf].

These guidelines emphasize that **symptom-driven management** is superior to size-based algorithms, and that observation is appropriate in stable, asymptomatic patients [^9ba1ba80].

---

## Evidence supporting conservative management

Conservative management of small, asymptomatic PSP has been shown to be safe and effective, with **low rates of progression** and favorable outcomes. The RAMPP trial demonstrated that ambulatory management of PSP is non-inferior to standard care, with shorter hospital stays and acceptable safety profiles [^78e25b8f]. Additionally, observational studies report high rates of spontaneous resolution and low recurrence with conservative management in appropriately selected patients [^4ebc40c4].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of intervention

Interventional procedures such as needle thoracostomy, chest tube placement, or intubation carry risks, including:

- **Needle thoracostomy**: Risk of infection, bleeding, misplacement, and unnecessary trauma.
- **Chest tube placement**: Risk of infection, bleeding, pain, and procedural complications.
- **Intubation**: Risk of barotrauma, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and unnecessary sedation.

Given the absence of symptoms or instability, the **benefits of intervention do not outweigh the risks** in this patient [^96343c10].

---

## Recommended follow-up and monitoring

Conservative management should include:

- **Observation**: Monitor for the development of symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea, or signs of tension pneumothorax.
- **Follow-up chest X-ray**: Repeat within 24–48 hours to ensure stability or resolution of the pneumothorax [^notfound].
- **Patient education**: Advise on warning signs and when to seek immediate medical attention.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate next step is **observation with a follow-up chest X-ray** because the patient has a small, asymptomatic primary spontaneous pneumothorax and is hemodynamically stable. Emergent interventions are not indicated, and conservative management is supported by current guidelines and evidence. The patient should be monitored closely for any changes in symptoms or pneumothorax size, with a low threshold for intervention if clinical deterioration occurs [^96343c10] [^fc5460bf].

### Management of spontaneous pneumothorax: an American College of Chest Physicians Delphi consensus statement [^329a6410]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Provide explicit expert-based consensus recommendations for the management of adults with primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothoraces in an emergency department and inpatient hospital setting. The use of opinion was made explicit by employing a structured questionnaire, appropriateness scores, and consensus scores with a Delphi technique. The guideline was designed to be relevant to physicians who make management decisions for the care of patients with pneumothorax.

Options

Decisions for observation, chest tube placement, surgical interventions, and radiographic imaging.

Outcomes

Effectiveness of pneumothorax resolution, duration of and patient tolerance of care, and pneumothorax recurrence.

Evidence

Literature review from 1967 to January 1999 and Delphi questionnaire submitted in three iterations to a multidisciplinary physician panel.

Values

The guideline development group determined by consensus the relevant outcomes to be considered in developing the Delphi questionnaire.

Benefits, Harms, and Costs

The type and magnitude of benefits, harms, and costs expected for patients from guideline implementation.

Recommendations

Management decisions vary between patients with primary or secondary pneumothoraces, with observation of small pneumothoraces being appropriate only for primary pneumothoraces. The level of consensus varies regarding the specific interventions indicated, but agreement exists for the general principles of care.

Validation

Recommendations were peer reviewed by physician experts and were reviewed by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Health and Science Policy Committee.

Implementation

The guideline recommendations will be published in printed and electronic form with distribution of synopses for patients and health care providers. Contents of the guideline will be incorporated into continuing medical education programs.

Sponsors

The ACCP.

### Pneumothorax management: current state of practice in the UK [^b182fe2b]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Whilst there has always been allowance for individual clinician preference in guidelines, there needs to be consensus on the optimum management strategy. The challenge the new guidelines face is to design a simple and pragmatic approach, using this new evidence base. It may be that a more personalised, stratified approach to treatment decision-making in PSP could minimise this variation, but as yet, there are no good predictors of early treatment failure. Failure of medical management (i.e. ongoing air leak at Day 4) may be predicted by digital airflow measurement but whether this can be translated into a new clinical pathway needs to be confirmed in an RCT. Further data and the updated ERS and BTS guidelines are eagerly awaited. The real test, however, will be in the future education and implementation.

### Tuberculosis technical instructions for panel physicians (...) [^19a19bd1]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Infectious tuberculosis disease screening requirements vary based on age of applicant and the WHO-estimated tuberculosis disease incidence rate in the country where the exam occurs. A complete screening medical examination for tuberculosis disease consists of a medical history, physical examination, then the following items when required by these instructions: IGRA; chest x-ray; sputum samples for molecular testing on the first sputum sample, smears for acid-fast bacilli, solid and liquid culture testing for mycobacteria with confirmation of the. People with HIV infection are less likely to have an abnormal chest x-ray or positive IGRA during infectious tuberculosis disease; and negative IGRA results do not rule out infectious tuberculosis disease; thus, all applicants with known HIV infection must provide three sputum specimens for smears and culture plus molecular testing of the first sample, regardless of IGRA or chest x-ray results, to rule out infectious tuberculosis disease.

Additionally, applicants diagnosed with extrapulmonary tuberculosis only must have a chest x-ray and must provide three sputum specimens for smears and culture plus molecular testing of the first sample, regardless of IGRA or chest x-ray results, in order to rule out infectious tuberculosis disease. Applicants ≥15 years of age examined in these countries must have a medical history, physical examination, and chest x-ray. Those applicants who have signs or symptoms suggestive of infectious tuberculosis disease, chest x-ray findings suggestive of infectious tuberculosis disease, or known HIV infection must provide three sputum specimens for smears and culture plus molecular testing of the first sample. Tuberculosis Screening for Applicants in Low Tuberculosis Burden Countries.

Applicants ≥15 years of age who are examined in high-tuberculosis-burden countries must have a chest x-ray regardless of IGRA result. Applicants who have a chest x-ray with findings suggestive of infectious tuberculosis disease, signs or symptoms of tuberculosis disease, or known HIV infection must provide three sputum specimens for smears and culture plus molecular testing of the first sample. Initial Evaluation Medical History
- The medical history should focus on risk factors for infectious tuberculosis disease, including previous history of tuberculosis disease; illness suggestive of tuberculosis disease; prior treatment suggestive of tuberculosis disease treatment; and prior diagnostic evaluation suggestive of tuberculosis disease.

### Pneumothorax management: current state of practice in the UK [^f69ed578]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and objective

Spontaneous pneumothorax is a common pathology but optimal initial treatment regime is not well defined. Treatment options including conservative management, needle aspiration (NA) or insertion of a small-bore chest drain. Recent large randomised controlled trials may change the treatment paradigm: comparing conservative and ambulatory management to standard care, but current guidelines need to be updated. The aim of this study was to assess the current “state of play” in the management of pneumothorax in the UK.

Methods

Physicians and respiratory healthcare staff were invited to complete an online survey on the initial and subsequent management of pneumothorax.

Results

This study is the first survey of pneumothorax practice across the UK, which highlights variation in practice: 50% would manage a large primary pneumothorax with minimal symptoms conservatively, compared to only 3% if there were significant symptoms; 64% use suction if the pneumothorax had not resolved after > 2 days, 15% always clamp the chest drain prior to removal; whereas 30% never do. NICE guidance recommends the use of digital suction but this has not translated into widespread usage: only 23% use digital suction to check for resolution of air leak).

Conclusion

Whilst there has always been allowance for individual clinician preference in guidelines, there needs to be consensus on the optimum management strategy. The challenge the new guidelines face is to design a simple and pragmatic approach, using this new evidence base.

### Clinical and laboratory diagnosis for tuberculosis (...) [^2b184ed6]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Considerations All persons with signs or symptoms of TB disease or a positive result from a TB blood test or tuberculin skin test should be medically evaluated for TB disease. Diagnosis A complete medical evaluation for TB disease has five components:
- Medical history
- Physical examination
- TB blood tests or TB skin test
- Chest radiograph
- Bacteriologic examination When conducting a medical history, the health care provider should ask about the following:
- If the person has underlying medical conditions, especially HIV, other immunocompromising conditions, or diabetes that can increase the risk for progression from latent TB infection to TB disease. A physical examination cannot be used to confirm or rule out TB disease.

However, it is an essential part of any evaluation and can:
- Provide valuable information about the patient's overall condition,
- Inform the method of diagnosis, and
- Reveal factors that may affect treatment if the patient is diagnosed with TB disease. Some signs of extrapulmonary TB disease may be observed during a physical examination. There are two tests that are used to determine if a person has been infected with TB bacteria:
- TB blood test
- TB skin test. Chest radiographs help differentiate between latent TB infection and pulmonary TB disease in people with positive results from a TB blood test or TB skin test. A posterior-anterior chest radiograph is used to detect chest abnormalities. Lesions may appear anywhere in the lungs and may differ in size, shape, density, and cavities.

These abnormalities may suggest TB disease but cannot be used to definitively diagnose TB disease. Normal findings on chest radiography generally can be used to rule out pulmonary TB in a person who has had a positive reaction to a TB blood test or TB skin test and no symptoms of disease. Rare exceptions have been noted in patients with HIV whose immune status has not been restored by anti-viral treatment. Examinations of clinical specimens are of critical diagnostic importance. The specimens should be examined and cultured in a laboratory that specializes in testing for.

### Which clinical factors are predictive of outcome in primary spontaneous pneumothorax management? [^3327b0d9]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Spontaneous pneumothorax is a common pathology with an incidence of 17–24 and 1–6 per 100 000 population per annum for men and women, respectively.Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) conventionally refers to patients with no underlying lung disease.

The optimal initial treatment regime for PSP is not yet defined.Options include conservative management, aspiration or insertion of a small-bore chest drain. International guidelines and expert consensus statements vary.Recently updated British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines suggest treatment should be offered to patients with symptomatic pneumothorax.Previous guidelines suggested aspiration as initial treatment, followed by chest tube insertion, if unsuccessful.If admitted, then the average hospital stay is 4–5 days.Patients with ongoing pneumothorax (ongoing air leak and/or the lung not fully re-expanded on chest radiograph (CXR)) by days 4–5 have ‘failed’ medical treatment and should be referred for surgical management.

Currently, there are no validated predictive models for treatment failure in patients with PSP. No prior studies have investigated the relationship between patient symptoms and outcomes.

We hypothesised that patients with longer symptom duration and higher symptom scores would be more likely to fail treatment.

### TB 101-4. chest X-ray (...) [^3fbfdb3d]. CDC (1999). Low credibility.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 1600 Clifton Rd. Atlanta, GA 30329, USA 800-CDC-INFO TTY: 232-6348 The fourth component of a complete TB medical evaluation is a chest x-ray. A patient should have a chest x-ray if he or she has a positive blood test or skin test, or has signs and symptoms of TB disease, or been exposed to someone with TB disease. The chest x-ray is useful for diagnosing TB disease because TB disease in the lungs, also known as pulmonary TB, is the most common form of TB disease. For adults without HIV infection, the chest x-ray will usually appear abnormal when a patient has TB disease in the lungs. It may show infiltrates or cavities. In persons with HIV infection and in children, the chest x-ray of someone with pulmonary TB can look normal or have very subtle changes. Consultation with an experienced TB clinician is recommended. Chest x-ray results alone cannot confirm that a person has TB disease.

A variety of illnesses may produce abnormalities whose appearance on a chest x-ray resembles TB. Although an abnormality on a chest x-ray may lead a clinician to suspect TB, further tests are needed to confirm that a person has TB disease.

### Spontaneous pneumothorax: time to rethink management? [^af3b24b8]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

There are substantial differences in international guidelines for the management of pneumothorax and much geographical variation in clinical practice. These discrepancies have, in part, been driven by a paucity of high-quality evidence. Advances in diagnostic techniques have increasingly allowed the identification of lung abnormalities in patients previously labelled as having primary spontaneous pneumothorax, a group in whom recommended management differs from those with clinically apparent lung disease. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying pneumothorax are now better understood and this may have implications for clinical management. Risk stratification of patients at baseline could help to identify subgroups at higher risk of recurrent pneumothorax who would benefit from early intervention to prevent recurrence. Further research into the roles of conservative management, Heimlich valves, digital air-leak monitoring, and pleurodesis at first presentation might lead to an increase in their use in the future.

### Pneumothorax management: current state of practice in the UK [^b2f8d7ec]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Spontaneous pneumothorax is a common pathology with an incidence of 17–24 and 1–6 per 100,000 population per annum for men and women, respectively. Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (PSP) conventionally refers to patients with no underlying lung disease; whereas those with lung conditions are termed Secondary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (SSP).

The most recent European Respiratory Society (ERS) and British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines for the management of pneumothorax were published in 2015 and 2010, respectively. The optimal initial treatment regime for PSP is not well defined: treatment options including conservative management, needle aspiration (NA) or insertion of a small-bore chest drain. Pleural drainage is recommended in patients with a large pneumothorax and/or symptoms initially with NA and then, if unsuccessful, chest drain insertion. However, two large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have recently been published which may change the treatment paradigm: comparing conservative and ambulatory management to standard care, and the guidelines are due to be updated. The aim of this study was to assess the current “state of play” in the management of pneumothorax in the UK.

### Conservative versus interventional management for primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults [^b21b7e90]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is widely managed according to size with interventional techniques based on practice guidelines. Interventional management is not without complications and observational data suggest conservative management works. The current guidelines are based on expert consensus rather than evidence, and a systematic review may help in identifying evidence for this practice.

Objectives

The objective of the review is to compare conservative and interventional treatments of adult primary spontaneous pneumothorax for outcomes of clinical efficacy, tolerability and safety.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library, Issue 6, 2014); MEDLINE via Ovid SP (1920 to 26th June 2014); EMBASE via Ovid SP (1947 to 26th June 2014); CINAHL via EBSCO host (1980 to 26th June 2014); and ISI Web of Science (1945 to 26th June 2014). We searched ongoing trials via the relevant databases and contacted authors. We also searched the 'grey literature'.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and we accepted quasi-RCTs if a systematic method of allocation was used. Participants were limited to adults aged 18 to 50 years, with their first symptomatic primary spontaneous pneumothorax with radiological evidence and no underlying lung disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two of five authors independently reviewed all studies in the search criteria and made inclusions and exclusions according to the selection criteria. No statistical methods were necessary as there were no included trials.

Main Results

We identified 358 studies with duplicates removed. There were three potentially relevant studies that we excluded as they were not randomized controlled trials. There was one ongoing trial that was relevant and we contacted the authors and confirmed the study is ongoing at June 2014. We will update this review when this ongoing study is completed.

Authors' Conclusions

There are no completed randomized controlled trials comparing conservative and interventional management for primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults. There is a lack of high-quality evidence for current guidelines in management and a need for randomized controlled trials comparing conservative and interventional management for this condition.

Duration of treatment

The median treatment duration was 3 days (IQR 1–6). Same-day patients had a longer median duration of treatment (3.5 days, 1–7) versus 2 days (0–5) for those with long symptom duration (p 0.003), in keeping with the definition of treatment failure (ongoing pneumothorax at day 4). Patients with a large pneumothorax on initial CXR (>4 cm) had longer treatment duration (3 days (1–7)) than those with moderate size pneumothorax (1 day (0–5)) (p 0.001, Mann-Whitney).

### Pneumothorax as a complication of combination antiangiogenic therapy in children and young adults with refractory / recurrent solid tumors [^b1040198]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Appropriate management of a pneumothorax includes observation alone, observation with supplemental oxygen, needle aspiration, insertion of an intercostal catheter or thoracostomy tube, or invasive thoracoscopy or thoracotomy. Although treatment options are dictated by clinical symptoms and size of the pneumothorax, many aspects about the management of pneumothorax in children, especially those with cancer, are challenging and currently there are no established guidelines for children. Furthermore, establishing a standardized approach is difficult as the data in children are based on small-scale studies and mainly address primary spontaneous pneumothorax. Because of the link between the development of a pneumothorax and combination antiangiogenic chemotherapy-induced tumor cavitation in our patient population at a median of 5.7 weeks from the start of therapy, we recommend imaging with a 2-view chest x-ray at least 3–4 weeks from the initiation of therapy to evaluate for the presence of cavitary change in the lung nodules and an asymptomatic pneumothorax. Patients with these findings warrant close observation with serial imaging. The caregiver and patient should also be educated about potential symptoms necessitating further evaluation. Given the need for knowledge concerning appropriate management guidelines in children, we propose an algorithm for the management of spontaneous pneumothorax as a complication of treatment for advanced cancer (Fig. 2). Our algorithm was devised based on the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) consensus statement regarding treatment of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults. We added our experience to formulate a pediatric-specific pneumothorax management protocol.

### Expectant management of pneumothorax in intubated COVID-19 positive patients: a case series [^80e7c2f3]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Although there are multiple presentations, respiratory disease is the primary manifestation of a severe COVID-19 infection. For managing severe ARDS due to COVID-19, current guidelines from the United States National Institutes of Health recommend using “low tidal volume ventilation (VT 4–8 mL/kg of predicted body weight) over higher tidal volumes (VT >8 mL/kg)” and “prone ventilation for 12 to 16 hours per day over no prone ventilation” for hypoxia refractory to optimized ventilatory settings. Chest CT is an instrumental part of the workup and assessment of disease severity with the most common findings being bilateral ground glass opacities. COVID-19 infection has already shown lung parenchymal changes that progressed to large bulla, which coalesce and enlarge over time leading to bullous emphysematous disease and subpleural blebs. This could predispose this population to developing pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum, which have already been reported in the literature. One explanation for the pneumomediastinum could be the Macklin effect, where air from ruptured alveoli dissects along bronchovascular planes and into the mediastinum. This is in contrast to a pneumothorax where the alveolar rupture is involved with injury to the visceral pleura resulting in air accumulation in the pleural space. A small asymptomatic primary pneumothorax can typically be managed with observation and sequential imaging to ensure stabilization or re-expansion of the lung. However, barotrauma from positive pressure ventilation is a well-known cause of iatrogenic pneumothorax and the current recommendation for critically ill patients who are intubated in the ICU is tube thoracostomy placement. To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no recommendations specifically for managing a small pneumothorax in a COVID-19 positive patient. In each of these cases of pneumothorax due to barotrauma we decided to pursue non-operative management. Factors contributing to this decision were the small size of the pneumothoraces and the fact that the patient would need to be disconnected from the ventilator to allow the lung to drop to avoid parenchymal injury, which could be detrimental to an already critical patient. For the majority of our cases we decreased the PEEP as much as possible and recommend this practice to others attempting expectant management. However, further studies are needed to assess if this truly makes a difference. An additional benefit was limiting viral exposure to hospital staff. The limitations of this study is that there were only 4 cases encountered making it difficult to apply to a larger group, and that the pneumothoraces were small (< 3 cm from apex to cupola), leaving no guidance for those with moderate to large sized pneumothoraces. We have not managed any other COVID-19 patients with pneumothorax to date. While no institutional guidelines exist, we would have a lower threshold for pleural drainage in moderate to large pneumothoraces. Expectant management can be quite precarious in this population, but we believe these cases show that observation in ventilated COVID-19 positive patients with a small pneumothorax may be an appropriate option. It has been shown in post-mortem studies that COVID-19 causes diffuse alveolar damage and lymphocytic or cellular fibromyxoid exudate. We hypothesize that this severe exudative process may contribute to sealing the alveolar and pleural injury, allowing for small pneumothoraces to remain stable during positive pressure ventilation. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold we will learn more about the exact pathophysiology that occurs.

### Ambulatory management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax: an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^9eb5ae89]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

No significant differences between intervention groups were observed in secondary outcome measures in terms of VAS pain or breathlessness scores, time off work, and overall recurrence at 30 days. However, the pneumothorax recurrence rate within 7 days of treatment completion was higher in those who received standard care. Recurrence at this early stage is unusual and is often presumed to be due to enlargement of an ongoing pneumothorax. As a result, investigators classified patients with pneumothorax within 7 days into two categories: ongoing if there had been incomplete re-expansion on chest radiograph at completion of treatment, or new recurrence if the pneumothorax had fully resolved on the last chest radiograph. The excess recurrence in patients receiving standard care was not entirely due to patients treated with aspiration alone, because they accounted for less than 53% of those with early recurrence.

Longer-term recurrence rates (1–12 months) were similar between the two groups. Despite excess recurrence in the standard care arm by 30 days, the cumulative rate of first ipsilateral recurrence was not statistically different at 12 months. The overall rate of recurrence (27%) is consistent with previous large epidemiological studies.

A 2020 randomised trialin primary spontaneous pneumothorax compared conservative management (ie, no intervention) with standard care (ie, chest tube insertion),reporting that the conservative approach was non-inferior to standard care in the primary outcome of resolution of pneumothorax on chest radiograph at 8 weeks. We have concerns about the widespread adoption of this approach. First, the trial screened more than 2600 patients to randomly assign 316, and it required 39 sites recruiting for 6 years. Excluding patients with previous pneumothorax would automatically exclude about 25% of the population. The reasons for which all other patients were excluded in the trial are unclear. The trial might therefore be applicable only to those patients with minimal symptoms, and it is already recognised that conservative management is wholly appropriate in some cases of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (as stated in the 2010 BTS guidelines). Second, the primary outcome was radiological, rather than patient-centred (eg, symptoms, time in hospital). Few data are presented on patient symptoms except at 2 weeks and what was termed an overall satisfaction score. Therefore, although the conservative treatment study should be applauded for showing reduced inpatient hospital stay, we would suggest that symptomatic patients who choose or are chosen by the treating physicians for intervention should be considered for the ambulatory treatment strategy, which is shown here to be effective and reasonably safe.

### Reply to albert and dhooria [^9ba1ba80]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Dhooria and colleagues describe the dilemma of managing spontaneous pneumothorax: How does one know at first presentation if the initial air leak has resolved (and one is now managing the residual, nonexpanding pneumothorax) or if there is an ongoing air leak? The holy grail in addressing this issue in PSP would be a noninvasive test to assess for ongoing air leak (without the need for insertion of a tube in the chest). In the absence of such a test, Dhooria and colleagues have devised a pathway of management that includes a trial of the management of patients with a spontaneous pneumothorax with a chest tube in situ without underwater seal for a nominal period of 24 to 48 hours. Although the rationale for such a pathway should be applauded, there are practical and physiological flaws with this approach. The initial management steps of PSP seem overly cautious with a reliance on size measurement. The Australian conservative management study has shown that the size of pneumothorax is not a barrier to conservative management. We believe that the severity of symptoms should be the main decision criteria for intervention, and this principle is likely to be reflected in upcoming guidelines. Also, the suggestion of observing all patients for 12 hours, thereby requiring admission to the hospital for this period, does not seem necessary. Tension pneumothorax for PSP is thankfully rare (although admittedly, data are very limited). We do not believe there is justification for leaving the chest drain “open” to allow for the remote possibility of a tension pneumothorax while the patient is in the hospital. A significant proportion of physicians advocate a trial of “clamping” of the chest tube before removal that by the same reasoning risks the development of tension pneumothorax but is easily ameliorated by “unclamping” the chest tube by medical staff in response to physiological change.

### What is the difference in size of spontaneous pneumothorax between inspiratory and expiratory X-rays? [^5d92fb16]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The aims of this study were to compare the estimated size of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) calculated on inspiratory and expiratory radiographs using the volumetrically derived Collins method and to determine whether radiograph type influences size classification for treatment according to published guidelines.

Method

This retrospective cohort study included patients treated for PSP in the emergency departments of two metropolitan teaching hospitals. Data collected included patient demographics and interpleural distances required to calculate pneumothorax size by the Collins method and to classify PSP according to guidelines. The outcomes of interest were the difference in size estimate between radiograph types and agreement in size classification for treatment according to guidelines. Analysis is by bias-plot analysis, kappa analysis and descriptive statistics.

Results

A total of 49 pneumothoraces (44 patients) were studied. Median age was 22 years; 66% were men. Median PSP size on inspiratory radiographs was 24% (IQR 14% to 31%, range 5% to 100%). The average size difference between expiratory and inspiratory films was 9%, with size on expiratory radiographs being larger. The 95% limits of agreement were wide (-5% to 23%). For each guideline, size estimation on expiratory rather than inspiratory radiographs would have suggested a change in treatment for an additional seven patients (14%, 95% CI 7% to 27%).

Conclusions

On average, PSP size calculated on expiratory radiographs is 9% higher than that calculated on matched inspiratory radiographs. Applying current management guidelines, the size difference between inspiratory and expiratory x-rays may alter initial treatment recommendation for some patients.

### Requirement of interventional treatment in a patient being conservatively managed for persistent pneumothorax over a prolonged period [^4e3407af]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

An 85-year-old ex-smoker being managed conservatively over 2years for a small right apical pneumothorax presented to the respiratory clinic with suddenly worsening shortness of breath and chest pain. A chest radiograph demonstrated sudden deterioration in the size of his pneumothorax. Previous CT scans had found emphysematous cystic changes within the lungs, and his new presentation warranted definitive surgical intervention with a right bullectomy and talc pleurodesis through a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery procedure. The patient made a good recovery and was discharged from clinic a year later. This case demonstrates the importance of follow-up in patients with unresolved pneumothoraces due to the potential for sudden deterioration, and highlights the significance of respecting patient involvement and autonomy in the decision-making process.

### Ultrasonography for clinical decision-making and intervention in airway management: from the mouth to the lungs and pleurae [^ae82c408]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Quantification of pneumothorax size

The relative location of a lung point on the chest could theoretically be used to quantify the size of a pneumothorax. It is more anteriorly situated in a small pneumothorax and nearer the posterior surface of the chest if the pneumothorax is larger in size. Studies suggest that LUS can adequately quantify large and small pneumothoraces, but not moderately sized ones. It is notable that no consensus could be reached on whether LUS could accurately quantify pneumothorax or not, in the published consensus article on LUS. Hence, despite the well-established diagnostic accuracy of LUS for the diagnosis of pneumothorax, no evidence-based guidelines have been established on how to use LUS for the quantification of pneumothorax and the role of concurrent supplementary imaging such as plain chest X-ray or CT. It is the authors’ opinion that in a critically ill patient showing clinical signs of pneumothorax, with LUS findings consistent with this diagnosis, one should perform acute chest tube insertion in order to provide acute treatment of the patient and not await supplementary imaging. In a clinically stable patient with LUS showing signs of pneumothorax, one should await other forms of diagnostic imaging in order to establish the size of the pneumothorax prior to initiating treatment. Even though the quantification of pneumothorax size by the use of LUS is controversial, studies have demonstrated that LUS is a reliable tool for monitoring whether the size of a pneumothorax is increasing or decreasing.

Patient-centered outcomes are prioritized by defining patient centeredness as care “that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values, and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions”; some patients suffer psychological harm when a pulmonary nodule is discovered during screening or incidentally, and communication processes were identified as the most likely factor that could be modified to improve patient-centered outcomes; tools and systems designed to improve communication processes should be evaluated regarding their effect on outcomes important to patients, and to ensure these tools are helpful and ultimately used in practice, they should be developed with systematic input from stakeholders; as a next step, it would be optimal to form an organized, multi-stakeholder group, and this effort should use formal consensus processes to elicit concerns and unmet needs from multiple stakeholders, with the purpose of prioritizing research and assessing the evolving needs of the patient and research community.

### Imaging of urgencies and emergencies in the lung cancer patient [^02ef542a]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Spontaneous pneumothorax

Spontaneous pneumothorax is a very rare complication of lung cancer with an estimated occurrence rate of 0.03-0.05% in primary lung cancer. Only 2% of all spontaneous pneumothoraces is coexistent with malignant lung diseases. In approximately 75% of these cases, pneumothorax is the presenting feature of lung cancer. The clinical presentation is variable, depending on the extent of the pneumothorax, ranging from asymptomatic to extreme dyspnoea with hypotension and tachycardia in case of tension pneumothorax, which can be life-threatening. In tension pneumothorax, a positive pressure on mediastinal and intrathoracic structures can result in a reduced cardiac output with typical features of hypoxaemia and haemodynamic compromise. Erect chest radiograph is the imaging modality of choice for the initial diagnosis of a pneumothorax. CT is considered as the “gold standard” for the detection of a small (and anterior) pneumothorax and size estimation. The differentiation of a large from a small pneumothorax is made by identification of a rim of >2 cm between the lung margin and chest wall at the level of the hilum. Moreover, CT can better identify the relationship with underlying lung pathology, such as lung cancer (Fig. 3). Particularly in older patients presenting with a spontaneous pneumothorax, CT images should be scrutinised for malignancy as a possible cause. A tension pneumothorax should be suspected if there are additional features such as a mediastinal shift to the contralateral side or depression of the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm.

Spontaneous pneumothorax as the first sign of a primary lung carcinoma in an 87-year-old woman who presented at the emergency department with thoracic pain and severe respiratory distress. a Supine anteroposterior chest radiograph clearly depicts a right-sided pneumothorax with complete collapse of the right lung. The visceral pleural edge is observed clearly as a very thin, sharp line (yellow arrows) with the absence of vascular marking beyond the pleural line. b Axial contrast-enhanced chest CT in lung window setting shows a large thin-walled cystic lesion (asterisk) with peripheral solid nodular component (yellow arrow) in the right upper lobe as the underlying cause of the pneumothorax. Also, note the extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall. Histopathological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma (type “lung cancer associated with cystic airspaces”) was made after lobectomy

Small, asymptomatic pneumothorax can be treated conservatively. Larger, symptomatic pneumothorax requires active intervention by needle aspiration or chest drain insertion.

### Ambulatory management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax: an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^27be284a]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design

The RAMPP trial was a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial comparing ambulatory management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax with standard care based on national guidelines.Participants were screened and recruited from 24 hospitals in the UK with a track record of recruiting to trials and a strong link between emergency and respiratory departments. Study oversight was provided by the trial steering committee and an independent data monitoring committee, and ethical approval was provided by the UK National Research Ethics Service Committee (15/SC/0240). The trial protocol can be found online and in the appendix (pp 9–47).

Participants

Eligible patients had presented with a symptomatic spontaneous pneumothorax (confirmed by a chest radiograph or CT scan) and were aged 16–55 years (as per BTS definition). Once a patient was identified as having a primary spontaneous pneumothorax, the decision to intervene was made on the basis of current BTS guidelines: patients were enrolled if they had a large pneumothorax (≥2 cm interpleural distance at the level of the hilum) or significant symptoms, or both. Patients were ineligible if they had known or suspected underlying lung disease (including >20 pack-year tobacco smoking history, but excluding well controlled asthma), evidence of tension pneumothorax (defined as clinical or radiographic evidence of significantly increased intrapleural pressure causing haemodynamic compromise that requires urgent decompression), or a contraindication to thoracic procedure as determined by the responsible physician, or if they were pregnant or lactating. Patients requiring intervention could be enrolled and randomly assigned up to 24 h after presentation, provided that they remained hospitalised with an ongoing symptomatic pneumothorax despite initial intervention (eg, patients treated initially with aspiration and observed overnight) requiring chest tube insertion. Patients not requiring an intervention were invited to participate in an observational cohort up to 2 weeks after their initial presentation, the results of which will be published separately. All participants in the current study provided written informed consent.

### Spontaneous pneumothorax [^53fd44a0]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of spontaneous pneumothorax is 24/100,000 a year in men and 9.9/100,000 in women in England and Wales. The major contributing factor is smoking, which increases the likelihood by 22 times in men, and by 8 times in women. While death from spontaneous pneumothorax is rare, rates of recurrence are high, with one study of men in the US finding a total recurrence rate of 35%.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments in people presenting with spontaneous pneumothorax? What are the effects of interventions to prevent recurrence in people with previous spontaneous pneumothorax? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to April 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 16 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: chest-tube drainage (alone or plus suction), chest tubes (small, standard sizes, one-way valves), needle aspiration, and pleurodesis.

### UK guidelines on oesophageal dilatation in clinical practice [^711b48bd]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

A chest X-ray examination may show pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, air under the diaphragm or a pleural effusion but normal appearances do not exclude perforation. If clinical suspicion is high or if endoscopy examination raises the possibility of a deeper laceration than just mucosal, then ideally a CT scan with oral contrast should be performed. Conventional contrast studies are less sensitive and may miss small perforations.Moreover, CT can detect other complications, such as pleural effusions, pneumopericardium and pneumoperitoneum.
Perform endoscopic re-inspection if the patient becomes symptomatic while in the procedure room, in order to assess for the presence of perforation and to undertake treatment which may include immediate endoscopic stent placement (GRADE of evidence: low; strength of recommendation: strong).

Iatrogenic perforation is a medical emergency. The patient should be assessed by an experienced physician and experienced surgeon in order to formulate an appropriate plan, which may include surgical, endoscopic or conservative management.
Provide patients with contact information for the on-call team should they experience chest pain, breathlessness or become unwell (GRADE of evidence: low; strength of recommendation: strong).

(b)Timing of next follow-up and procedure end points

The timing of subsequent dilatation sessions may depend on the degree of success of initial dilatation and the patient’s response to the procedure. Patients often require multiple sessions, especially if the stricture has a narrow diameter or any complex features.In the majority of studies, a repeat procedure was performed after 1 week and a subsequent follow-up at 2–4 weeks.In some patients, however, symptoms tend to recur rapidly following dilatation, hence they may require more frequent weekly or biweekly dilatations based on symptoms and stricture resolution.

As a general rule, the last dilator size used in the previous session must be passed first. However, the degree of fibrosis and stricture healing is unpredictable and not all patients are expected to tolerate passage of the largest diameter dilator used during the previous session. Reassessment of stricture diameter is required and a smaller size dilator may be used if deemed appropriate.

Methods

Data was collected on the 236 patients enrolled in the Randomised Ambulatory Management of Primary Pneumothorax (RAMPP) study: a randomised controlled trial (RCT).Standard care was defined by the 2010 BTS Pleural guidelines which recommended initial aspiration but, at the discretion of the treating physician, a chest drain could be inserted.

Treatment failure was defined as ongoing air leak and/or the lung not fully re-expanded on CXR by day 4, at which point the patient was referred for surgery. Large pneumothorax was defined as ≥4 cm (measured at the level of the hilum on baseline CXR) by the investigators at randomisation. Variables included in the analysis were chosen for clinical likelihood of impacting treatment failure based on previous literature and expert opinion: duration of symptoms prior to presentation to hospital, severity of pain and breathlessness symptoms (as measured on a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)), initial clinical observations at admission (heart rate, respiratory rate and systolic blood pressure), previous personal history of pneumothorax, smoking status and size of pneumothorax (large or not).

Statistical analysis was assessed using the χ 2 test (for discrete binary outcomes) and t-test or Mann-Whitney U test (for continuous outcomes). Multivariate analysis was conducted by logistic regression. Statistical significance was set at 0.05. Statistical analysis was undertaken using Stata (V.14.2).

Patient and public involvement

This analysis was conducted as a post hoc analysis of a previously conducted randomised controlled trial. As such, patient and public involvement was not involved in this study design or conduct.

### Treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax [^f94f1eb1]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Initial treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax poses dilemmas for clinicians as size classification systems and current treatment guidelines differ in their approaches, and underlying evidence is weak. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent evidence and highlight remaining evidence gaps.

Recent Findings

Recent studies confirm significant variation in practice. New evidence suggests that conservative management may be a viable option in a wider range of patients than previously thought (including some large pneumothoraces), with a reported clinical success rate of 79%. New data regarding aspiration report similar treatment success rates and shorter hospitalizations than chest tube drainage; however, methodological issues challenge these findings. There are conflicting data about the prognostic implications of computed tomography-identified pulmonary dystrophia.

Summary

Initial management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax is controversial, and there remains little high-quality evidence to guide decision-making. International differences in classification systems and management recommendations make meaningful pooling of clinical trials difficult. This makes a strong case for international agreement about study methodology in order to facilitate meaningful comparisons. Recent evidence suggests that conservative management may be a viable option and argues for its place in much needed randomized trials.

### Aspirating pneumothorax: clearing the air or muddying the water? [^835b34d9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Was this higher rate of failure a result of the unconventional techniques used in this study? The use of suction (−25 cm H 2 O) for 30 minutes in both the aspiration and chest drain arms, and the use of larger-bore chest drains (16–20 F in the chest drain arm) rather than small-bore drains, as was used in the Marx and colleagues study, are not advocated by guidelines. Guidelines suggest manual aspiration via a three-way tap, as undertaken by the majority of studies included in Cochrane analyses, and there is no recommendation for early initiation of suction.

Recent studies suggest a conservative approach for minimally symptomatic patients regardless of size, and there are advocates of nonintervention as standard. Although we agree that minimally symptomatic patients can be treated conservatively regardless of the size of the pneumothorax (as was advocated in the BTS 2010 guidelines), we believe that symptomatic patients who opt for treatment should still be offered aspiration or insertion of a device containing a Heimlich valve to allow ambulatory management, if suitable care pathways are established in that institution. This will be the premise of the upcoming BTS 2023 guidelines. Two upcoming trials in the United Kingdom will answer the questions of: 1) whether conservative management of symptomatic patients with PSP is effective in terms of reducing the number of subsequent procedures (NIHR133653); and 2) whether early suction can reduce hospital stay for patients with PSP in the hospital with chest drains (NIHR133787).

We are delighted that the management of pneumothorax is being debated and encourage further research to optimize care.

### Update in management of paediatric primary spontaneous pneumothorax [^0e1b5f44]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Paediatric spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) management continues to lack paediatric-specific guideline recommendations. There have been increasing reports of paediatric retrospective case studies supplemented by important well designed RCT (predominantly) adult studies. Taken together, these suggest that conservative management may have an increasing role to play in the management of PSP and that aspiration may have limited utility as a first line intervention. Our local experience, as part of a multicentre retrospective analysis and subsequent audit of management since, corroborates recent published data: it highlights an increasing trend towards conservative management in spontaneous pneumothorax with similar rates of recurrence, compared to intervention, and low use of aspiration with similarly low success rates. We have therefore updated our local practice guidelines and share these with readers. Specifically, we have removed aspiration in the management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax and reserved intervention for children who are clinically unstable or show evidence of increasing air leak irrespective of pneumothorax size. Whilst the success of this change in clinical practice will need to be reviewed in the next 5-10 years, the overall low incidence of the condition, demands a multicentre, and probably multinational, collaborative approach to allow the best chance of obtaining definitive evidence to guide clinical paediatric management.

### Ambulatory management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax: an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^78e25b8f]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in otherwise healthy young patients. Optimal management is not defined and often results in prolonged hospitalisation. Data on efficacy of ambulatory options are poor. We aimed to describe the duration of hospitalisation and safety of ambulatory management compared with standard care.

Methods

In this open-label, randomised controlled trial, adults (aged 16–55 years) with symptomatic primary spontaneous pneumothorax were recruited from 24 UK hospitals during a period of 3 years. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to treatment with either an ambulatory device or standard guideline-based management (aspiration, standard chest tube insertion, or both). The primary outcome was total length of hospital stay including re-admission up to 30 days after randomisation. Patients with available data were included in the primary analysis and all assigned patients were included in the safety analysis. The trial was prospectively registered with the International Standard Randomised Clinical Trials Number, ISRCTN79151659.

Findings

Of 776 patients screened between July, 2015, and March, 2019, 236 (30%) were randomly assigned to ambulatory care (n=117) and standard care (n=119). At day 30, the median hospitalisation was significantly shorter in the 114 patients with available data who received ambulatory treatment (0 days [IQR 0–3]) than in the 113 with available data who received standard care (4 days [IQR 0–8]; p<0·0001; median difference 2 days [95% CI 1–3]). 110 (47%) of 236 patients had adverse events, including 64 (55%) of 117 patients in the ambulatory care arm and 46 (39%) of 119 in the standard care arm. All 14 serious adverse events occurred in patients who received ambulatory care, eight (57%) of which were related to the intervention, including an enlarging pneumothorax, asymptomatic pulmonary oedema, and the device malfunctioning, leaking, or dislodging.

Interpretation

Ambulatory management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax significantly reduced the duration of hospitalisation including re-admissions in the first 30 days, but at the expense of increased adverse events. This data suggests that primary spontaneous pneumothorax can be managed for outpatients, using ambulatory devices in those who require intervention.

### Management of pneumothorax: an update [^76061950]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pneumothorax is a global health problem. To date, there is still significant variation in the management of pneumothorax. For the past few years, there have been significant developments in the outpatient management of both primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP). We will review the latest evidence for the management of nontraumatic pneumothorax (spontaneous and iatrogenic) to include pneumothorax associated with COVID-19 infection.

Recent Findings

Outpatient management of both primary and SSP may be safe and feasible.

Summary

Outpatient management of both primary and SSP should be included in treatment options discussion with patients.

### Measurement of intrapleural pressure in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax: a pilot study [^81899362]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we demonstrated that intrapleural pressure could be successfully measured and visualized in patients with pneumothorax. Furthermore, we confirmed that the pressure value was a significant predictor of persistent air leak.

The initial management of patients with pneumothorax remains controversial. We previously proposed that treatment should be directed towards treating respiratory dysfunction, stopping the air leak, and avoiding recurrence, and we believe that management of pneumothorax involves these three steps. However, to decide on appropriate treatment in the second step, the air leak should be assessed up front, but this is presently impossible. Until now, management decisions have been based on findings on chest radiography and CT and the degree of lung collapse. However, those images are static and cannot determine if air leak is continuing or not. It has been possible to assess intrapleural pressure by observing the movement of water in the sealed chamber of a drainage bag and more recently using a digital system, but only in patients undergoing interventional drainage with a chest tube. According to the consensus statement of the American College of Chest Physicians, clinically stable patients with a small pneumothorax should be observed in the emergency department for 3–6 h and then discharged home if a repeat chest radiograph excludes progression of the pneumothorax. Confirmation of collapse of the lung at a single point in time does not provide information on whether an air leak is ongoing. Experienced physicians would agree that more severe symptoms may be correlated with a greater rate of change in intrapleural pressure, but may not be directly correlated with the existence of an air leak. To address this issue, we have developed a system for continuous measurement of intrapleural pressure in real time.

### Combining clinical, radiological and genetic approaches to pneumothorax management [^fc5b15cd]. Thorax (2022). Medium credibility.

Familial spontaneous pneumothorax (FSP) accounts for 10% of primary spontaneous pneumothoraces. Appropriate investigation of FSP enables early diagnosis of serious monogenic diseases and the practice of precision medicine. Here, we show that a pneumothorax genetics multidisciplinary team (MDT) can efficiently diagnose a range of syndromic causes of FSP. A sizeable group (73.6%) of clinically unclassifiable FSPs remains. Using whole genome sequencing we demonstrate that most of these cases are not known monogenic disorders. Therefore, clinico-radiological assessment by an MDT has high sensitivity for currently known clinically important monogenic causes of FSP, which has relevance for the design of efficient pneumothorax services.

### Primary spontaneous pneumothorax: treat the patient, not the X-ray [^1fed9c59]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In this issue of the Journal, Marx and colleagues (pp.) reported the largest randomized controlled trial on the management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). The Comparison of Exsufflation Versus Drainage in Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (EXPRED) trial randomized (at a 1:1 ratio) 402 patients from 31 emergency departments in France to undergo simple aspiration or insertion of a chest tube.

PSP predominantly affects young people with no significant underlying lung diseases. Its diagnosis and monitoring are always made on imaging, usually with chest X-rays (CXRs). Throughout past decades, clinicians have focused first-line management of PSP on correcting the radiographic abnormality. Prompt and full reexpansion of the lung is considered the key priority. A variety of drainage techniques have been used to evacuate the pleural air. Large-bore chest tubes, often aided by suction and obsessive apical positioning of drainage tubes, have become the default practice in many centers to achieve the best radiographic lung expansion.

However, large-bore chest tubes are known to cause pain, and their insertion also poses recognized risks. Less invasive alternative methods to evacuate air have been assessed. Aspiration of the air via different types of needles or small catheters is an attractive option and has been included in clinical guidelines as an alternative to chest tube drainage after several smaller randomized controlled trials showed promising results (–).

Although clinicians are willing to entertain less invasive options for “smaller” PSP, most still consider it “safer” to default to large-bore tube drainage if the CXR shows a sizeable pneumothorax. The EXPRED trial specifically addresses the role of simple aspiration in patients with a complete pneumothorax, defined as radiographic separation of the lung, from its apex to the base, from the lateral chest wall. In the trial, simple aspiration was performed with a catheter connected to a suction device at −25 cm H 2 O (to avoid variations associated with manual aspiration) for 30 minutes. A second bout of suction was allowed if needed. In the control group, patients underwent insertion of 16- or 20-F chest tubes for drainage.

### Primary spontaneous pneumothorax: treat the patient, not the X-ray [^6ee99522]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The primary endpoint of the trial followed those of many prior studies and centered on expansion of the lung. “Failure” was defined by any residual pneumothorax ⩾2 cm on radiographs 24 hours after the intervention. The study was set up as a noninferiority trial, but the predicted failure rate in the control group (based on literature data) differed significantly from the actual observed rate in the recruited subjects. Two different methods to define the inferiority margins were presented and created much discussion on their relative statistical validity.

Not surprisingly, the trial did find that patients treated with chest tubes had better radiographic success. Only 18% of drainages in the chest-tube group “failed,” compared with 29% in those treated with simple aspiration. However, patients in the aspiration group reported less pain (mean difference, −1.4 [95% CI: −1.89 to −0.91] on a 10-point scale), and significantly fewer of them described restriction in breathing as a result of pain (frequency difference, −18% [−27% to −9%]). Serious adverse events were uncommon in both groups. No intergroup differences were found in the long-term outcome measures, especially the recurrence rates after 1 year (20% in the aspiration group and 27% in the chest-tube group).

These results serve to confront clinicians to examine their priorities for PSP management. More invasive drainages provide better CXR improvement, reassuring clinicians, but at the expense of patient comfort and procedural risks.

The fundamental focus in PSP management should be to 1) relieve symptoms and 2) stop the air leak. PSP differs from secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in that the underlying, and the contralateral, lungs are usually normal. Thus, unlike secondary pneumothorax, PSP is rarely life-threatening, and the associated breathlessness is comparatively mild, usually restricting only severe exertion. It must also be remembered that lung expansion does not stop air leaks. The fact that most patients in this and other studies were successfully treated with needle aspiration implies that their air leaks had already stopped at the time of intervention. These observations should challenge the conventional practice of aiming to achieve urgent radiographic lung expansion with invasive procedures.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: a structured approach to a child with primary spontaneous pneumothorax [^7c4a58a2]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) is an uncommon presentation in children but may occur at any age and occurs in patients with no pre-existing lung disease. Management aims are to re-expand the collapsed lung, relieve pressure in the intrapleural space and avoid a tension pneumothorax. Correct management of PSP will avoid unnecessary intervention, reduce length of hospital stay and also reduce the risk of recurrence. There are no established guidelines for treating PSP in children and there is significant variation in management among centres and clinicians. This article provides a clear, evidence-based and structured approach to assessment and management of PSP in children and young people.

An 18-year-old male patient with a known history of Crohn's colitis was admitted for further management of his symptoms. He was treated with anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) adalimumab and intravenous steroids in addition to azathioprine. He developed sudden onset pleuritic chest pain. Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scanning was reported as normal. A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) showed evidence of a small peripheral wedge shaped area of consolidation in the left lower lobe. He was treated with oral antibiotics but the chest pain persisted for the next 2 weeks. A repeat chest x-ray performed 2 weeks later revealed evidence of a large hydro-pneumothorax which was promptly drained. A chest CT later showed evidence of lower lobe consolidation. Sputum cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus. It was felt that a broncho-pleural fistula due to the peripheral cavitating lesion led to the pneumothorax.

### Evaluation of patients with pulmonary nodules: when is it lung cancer?: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) [^b79a6808]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary nodules are spherical radiographic opacities that measure up to 30 mm in diameter. Nodules are extremely common in clinical practice and challenging to manage, especially small, "subcentimeter" nodules. Identification of malignant nodules is important because they represent a potentially curable form of lung cancer.

Methods

We developed evidence-based clinical practice guidelines based on a systematic literature review and discussion with a large, multidisciplinary group of clinical experts and other stakeholders.

Results

We generated a list of 29 recommendations for managing the solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) that measures at least 8 to 10 mm in diameter; small, subcentimeter nodules that measure < 8 mm to 10 mm in diameter; and multiple nodules when they are detected incidentally during evaluation of the SPN. Recommendations stress the value of risk factor assessment, the utility of imaging tests (especially old films), the need to weigh the risks and benefits of various management strategies (biopsy, surgery, and observation with serial imaging tests), and the importance of eliciting patient preferences.

Conclusion

Patients with pulmonary nodules should be evaluated by estimation of the probability of malignancy, performance of imaging tests to characterize the lesion(s) better, evaluation of the risks associated with various management alternatives, and elicitation of patient preferences for treatment.

Lung

A low dose high-resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) of the chest may be performed at diagnosis (R9a). The number and size of cysts may indicate pneumothorax risk and so inform personal counselling. However, there is no evidence supporting regular repeated imaging of the chest and it should only be repeated when clinically indicated. Pulmonary cysts are best defined by HRCT scans and lung ultrasound should not be used (R9). Little has been published regarding the impact of BHD syndrome on lung function. In a retrospective study Daccord et al. assessed clinical data regarding 96 individuals and found that BHD syndrome-related cystic lung disease did not affect respiratory function at baseline, except for slightly increased residual volume and reduced carbon monoxide transfer factor (DLCO). No significant syndrome-specific deterioration of lung function was seen in the limited follow-up period of 6 years. Currently, the consensus is that routine lung function testing is not indicated in asymptomatic individuals with BHD syndrome (R21). Data regarding pneumothorax risk during air travel and diving is limited, although it has been estimated that BHD syndrome patients have a pneumothorax risk of 0.63% per flight and a risk of 0.33% per episode of diving. In accordance, Gupta et al. (2017) found a similar low occurrence of pneumothorax during flying and also that the risk decreases in patients who have undergone pleurodesis. Anecdotally, the risk of pneumothorax may be higher in unpressurised aircraft. Individuals with BHD syndrome who plan to work as a pilot or dive regularly should seek specialised advice regarding the risks and potential preventative interventions (R22, R23). Treatment of pneumothorax in BHD syndrome does not differ from that of pneumothorax for other reasons. Surgical intervention, (e.g. Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) and chemical or mechanical pleurodesis or pleurectomy, or total pleural covering) should be considered in case of recurrent pneumothorax (R24, R25).

But it should be emphasized that there was no significant correlation between the prognosis and the severity of asymptomatic PSP, although patients with severe PSP tended to undergo invasive treatment. O’Rourke and Yee reported that up to 80% of pneumothorax cases with collapse of less than 15% volume of the lung will have no persistent air leak and recurrence when managed with observation alone. In our study, however, more than one third of patients with mild or moderate lung collapse eventually underwent the invasive therapy. Furthermore, some patients had a recurrence within 2 weeks of a recovery. Careful follow-up is very important because observation alone may not be sufficient for the treatment of asymptomatic PSP.

Several limitations of this study should be acknowledged. First, tobacco smoking, which is an important risk factor for PSP, was not included in this analysis because we do not have the smoking rate for university students. However, among the 43 students with asymptomatic PSP, only one was a current smoker and one was an ex-smoker. The smoking rate of students with asymptomatic PSP was not high compared with that of males in their twenties in Japan (about 30%). Second, most cases of asymptomatic PSP, especially mild or moderate cases, were detected a few days after the medical checkup, and the follow-up observation was sometimes insufficient. Immediate radiographic image interpretation is desirable.

### Randomised ambulatory management of primary pneumothorax (RAMPP): protocol of an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^75e4e4b5]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Failure of medical treatment

There is no robust evidence on the ideal timing for surgical intervention. Current BTS guidelines suggest that cases of persistent air leak or non-re-expansion should be referred after 3–5 days.To achieve objective outcomes for this study, the following measurable and documentable criteria have been developed to ensure consistent practice and will be recorded as part of the study in all cases. Referral for thoracic surgery will occur in the presence of all of the following:

Day 4 postinsertion of chest drain, persistent air leak as measured by ‘bubbling’ chest drain attached to underwater seal, or evidence of ongoing air leak through an ambulatory device.
Persistent pneumothorax on CXR.
Patient agreement.
No contraindication to thoracic surgery.

In all cases, the clinical parameters and radiology (both those referred to surgery and those successfully treated with medical management) will be blindly assessed at the end of the study to ensure the discharge and surgery criteria were robustly followed.

CT scan

CT scan will be conducted in all patients (approximately 2–4 weeks after enrolment) to detect lung parenchymal abnormalities. These should be conducted as per protocol (see online supplementary appendix C), including high-resolution limited cuts apically. Any patient who has a CT as part of their clinical care will not be required to have an additional scan. The CT regimen was designed to be low dose (total 3.4 mSv, equivalent of 1-year background radiation). The benefit of CT scanning in every young patient with pneumothorax is not proven and controversial due to the additional radiation dose. This trial aims to determine whether CT findings can predict long-term outcomes and therefore be of clinical utility.

### Thoracoscopy in the management of pneumothorax [^3cdccbe1]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Spontaneous pneumothorax is a common condition that impacts significantly on healthcare expenditure. However, optimal management of spontaneous pneumothorax remains a subject of considerable controversy. A thoracic surgeon's perspective on the use of thoracoscopy and video-assisted thoracic surgery with a focus on surgical techniques in the current management of this condition is presented.
