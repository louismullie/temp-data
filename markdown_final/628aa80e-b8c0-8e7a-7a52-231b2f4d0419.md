## Question

How do I treat herpes labialis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat herpes labialis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the clinical scenario into primary infection, recurrent episodic treatment, or suppression. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for oral versus topical therapies. Next, I will review dosing, timing, and safety, including special populations. After that, I should consider emerging options and what to avoid. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized algorithm and counseling points with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical categories because treatment hinges on them: primary herpetic gingivostomatitis, recurrent herpes labialis managed episodically, and frequent recurrences warranting suppressive therapy. I need to ensure I separate pediatric primary disease from adult recurrent disease and keep immunocompromised hosts in mind as a distinct group with different thresholds for therapy and dosing considerations [^111w5Ysk] [^116n95aP].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy. Wait, let me verify that oral antivirals have the strongest and most consistent benefit for recurrent herpes labialis, whereas topical agents offer modest benefit and are best reserved for early prodrome or when oral therapy is not feasible. Systematic reviews and guidelines consistently favor oral therapy for meaningful clinical effect sizes, which I should anchor on before recommending anything else [^112TnzB1] [^113uyWzS] [^111w5Ysk].

> For recurrent herpes labialis, I will now examine oral options and dosing. Famciclovir 1500 mg as a single dose at the first prodromal symptom reduces time to healing by about 1.3 days versus placebo, with median healing around 4.4 days in the active arm, and this is FDA-approved for this indication, so I should prioritize it for convenience and adherence when started early [^1117HwzL] [^112w7Sbj]. Valacyclovir 2 g orally, then 2 g again 12 hours later, is another single-day regimen with FDA labeling for cold sores, and I need to emphasize that efficacy drops if started after vesicles appear, so timing is critical [^117YDDaA] [^11435F2m]. Acyclovir 400 mg five times daily for 5 days remains an alternative, though adherence is harder with multi-dose regimens, and I should confirm that it still shortens duration by about a day when started promptly [^1121q94H].

> Hold on, I should verify topical options for when oral therapy is declined or unavailable. Penciclovir 1% cream applied every 2 hours while awake for 4 days shortens lesion duration by roughly half a day and is FDA-approved for patients 12 years and older, which is a modest but real benefit if started early [^117GVHVM] [^115BKk3g]. Docosanol 10% cream applied five times daily shortens healing by about 18 hours versus placebo and is available over the counter, making it a reasonable alternative when prescription therapy is not accessible [^1178LD9k]. Acyclovir 5% cream five times daily for 4 days shortens episodes by about half a day and is FDA-approved for immunocompetent patients 12 years and older, though I should note it does not prevent progression if started late [^116t3SUL] [^1137LYCz]. Let me reconsider combination therapy: acyclovir 5% plus hydrocortisone 1% (Xerese) reduces the likelihood of ulceration and shortens healing by about 1.6 days versus vehicle, and is FDA-approved down to age 6, which can be useful when inflammation is prominent or when I want to maximize topical benefit [^1131toNF] [^113YWfsU].

> I need to check special formulations and devices. A single mucoadhesive acyclovir buccal tablet (Sitavig 50 mg) applied at prodrome reduces episode duration by about half a day and is FDA-approved for immunocompetent adults; this is a one-time application that avoids systemic exposure, which some patients prefer [^111WHHQ5] [^111juofo]. Iontophoretic delivery of topical acyclovir has shown promising reductions in healing time in small studies, but I should confirm this remains investigational and not standard of care in most settings [^113fe8Lz].

> For suppression in patients with frequent or severe recurrences, I should confirm that daily oral therapy reduces recurrence frequency. Acyclovir 400 mg twice daily reduces clinical recurrences by about 53% and virologic recurrences by about 71% in trials, and valacyclovir 500 mg to 1 g daily is effective and better tolerated for many patients, with crossover data suggesting fewer recurrences and longer time to first recurrence versus episodic therapy [^114bcZBM] [^112neubN]. I should double-check that guidelines endorse suppressive therapy for those with six or more episodes per year or significant psychosocial burden, and counsel on safety and monitoring if used long term [^114V8hXG].

> Now, for primary herpetic gingivostomatitis, I should confirm pediatric-focused therapy. Oral acyclovir suspension 20 mg/kg per dose four times daily for 7–10 days reduces oral lesions, new extraoral lesions, and feeding difficulties in children under 6 years, and is the most evidence-supported option for moderate disease; supportive care for hydration and pain remains essential [^111CJ6d2] [^112QUFaw]. But wait, what if the child is immunocompromised or has severe disease? In that case, IV acyclovir is indicated initially with step-down to oral therapy as lesions regress, which I need to ensure is recognized in pediatric HIV and immunocompromise guidance [^11616Zye] [^11356ckC].

> I should confirm special populations and safety. In adolescents and adults with normal renal function, single-day oral regimens are generally safe; in renal impairment, I need to adjust famciclovir and valacyclovir dosing per label to avoid neurotoxicity, and I should counsel on hydration with valacyclovir [^112uoxsZ] [^1126kK9d]. In pregnancy, I should avoid routine suppressive therapy for labialis unless clearly indicated, and if treatment is needed, topical options or carefully selected oral regimens may be considered with shared decision-making given limited specific data for labialis in pregnancy [^notfound]. For immunocompromised patients, I need to ensure I escalate to oral or IV antivirals promptly and consider resistance risk if lesions fail to respond, recognizing that topical monotherapy is inadequate in this group [^116n95aP].

> Next, I should review what to avoid or use cautiously. Imiquimod applied to active lesions caused severe local inflammation and is not recommended for acute treatment despite signals for delayed recurrence, so I should steer patients away from it for episodic care [^113V2Fms]. Sunscreen can prevent UV-triggered recurrences in experimental settings, but real-world benefit is inconsistent, so I can mention it as an adjunct for those with clear sun triggers without overpromising benefit [^114V8hXG]. I need to ensure patients do not rely on unproven supplements like lysine, which have not shown consistent benefit in prevention trials [^114ZNDVm].

> Let me consider emerging options, but I should be careful not to overstate. BCG vaccination showed a modest delay in time to first recurrence in frequent cold-sore sufferers, with a larger effect in males, but this is hypothesis-generating and not practice-changing yet; patients should not seek BCG solely for this purpose outside trials [^112h74d7] [^111qHq9k]. A single-dose helicase-primase inhibitor (amenamevir) shortened time to healing by about half a day in a phase 3 trial, suggesting a new mechanism, but availability and real-world use remain limited pending regulatory review [^116epM1P]. Phototherapy devices emitting 1072-nm light have small studies suggesting reduced healing time, yet heterogeneity and limited replication mean I should present these as optional, low-certainty alternatives rather than standard care [^116U123C] [^117R4CcT].

> I will now synthesize a practical algorithm. For immunocompetent adults with recurrent herpes labialis, start with a single-day oral regimen at prodrome when possible: famciclovir 1500 mg once or valacyclovir 2 g then 2 g 12 hours later, recognizing that benefit wanes if started after vesicles appear; if oral therapy is not feasible, use penciclovir 1% cream every 2 hours while awake for 4 days or docosanol 10% cream five times daily, with acyclovir 5% cream as an alternative, and consider acyclovir-hydrocortisone to reduce ulceration risk; for frequent recurrences, offer suppressive acyclovir or valacyclovir with shared decision-making and periodic reassessment of need [^1117HwzL] [^117YDDaA] [^117GVHVM] [^1178LD9k] [^1131toNF] [^114V8hXG]. For children with primary herpetic gingivostomatitis, use acyclovir suspension 20 mg/kg QID for 7–10 days if disease is moderate to severe, with supportive care and escalation to IV therapy if severe or unable to take oral medication [^111CJ6d2] [^11616Zye].

> Finally, I need to ensure counseling is explicit. Patients should initiate therapy at the first tingling, itching, or burning, ideally before vesicles appear, because efficacy declines substantially after lesion onset; they should complete the short course as directed and avoid sharing utensils or engaging in close contact during active lesions to reduce transmission risk, even though HSV-1 is common and often acquired in childhood [^11435F2m] [^111w5Ysk]. I should confirm that patients understand there is no cure, that recurrences are expected, and that suppressive therapy is an option for those with frequent or psychosocially burdensome episodes, with safety monitoring if used long term [^114ZNDVm] [^1124kvYZ].

Treat herpes labialis by initiating **oral antivirals at prodrome** (acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir) to shorten duration and reduce severity [^113uyWzS] [^1121q94H]. If oral therapy is not feasible, use **topical antivirals** (penciclovir, acyclovir, or docosanol) applied frequently at first symptoms [^115XteTY] [^117GVHVM] [^1178LD9k]. For frequent recurrences (≥ 6/year), consider **daily suppressive therapy** with acyclovir or valacyclovir [^1124kvYZ] [^114ZNDVm]. Supportive care includes analgesics, hydration, and avoiding triggers; educate patients to start treatment at prodrome and maintain hygiene to limit transmission [^11435F2m].

## Pharmacological treatments

### Oral antiviral therapy

Oral antivirals are **first-line** for recurrent herpes labialis because they reduce duration, severity, and pain [^113uyWzS] [^1121q94H]. Initiate at prodrome for best effect [^11435F2m].

| **Medication** | **Dosage** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Acyclovir | 400 mg orally five times daily for 5 days | Recurrent herpes labialis [^notfound] |
| Valacyclovir | 2 g orally every 12 hours for 1 day (total 2 doses) | Recurrent herpes labialis [^114V8hXG] |
| Famciclovir | 1,500 mg orally once | Recurrent herpes labialis [^112w7Sbj] |

---

Initiating therapy within 24 hours of prodrome **significantly reduces lesion duration and pain** [^1121q94H] [^1117HwzL].

---

### Topical antiviral therapy

Topical agents are **less effective than oral therapy** but are options when oral treatment is not feasible [^111w5Ysk]. Apply at first symptoms for modest benefit [^117GVHVM].

- **Penciclovir 1% cream**: Apply every 2 hours while awake for 4 days; reduces duration by ~0.5–1 day [^117GVHVM].
- **Acyclovir 5% cream**: Apply five times daily for 4 days; reduces duration by ~0.5–1 day [^116t3SUL].
- **Docosanol 10% cream**: Apply five times daily; reduces duration by ~0.5–1 day [^1178LD9k].

---

### Suppressive therapy

For patients with frequent recurrences (≥ 6/year), **daily suppressive therapy** reduces frequency and severity [^1124kvYZ] [^114ZNDVm].

- **Acyclovir**: 400 mg orally twice daily [^1124kvYZ].
- **Valacyclovir**: 500 mg orally once daily [^notfound].

---

## Non-pharmacological and supportive care

Supportive care **improves comfort** and may reduce complications:

- **Analgesics**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain relief.
- **Hydration**: Maintain adequate fluid intake.
- **Trigger avoidance**: Minimize stress, fatigue, UV exposure, and trauma [^112TnzB1].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Education is essential to optimize outcomes and limit transmission:

- **Early treatment**: Start at prodrome (tingling, itching) for best effect [^11435F2m].
- **Hygiene**: Avoid sharing utensils, towels, or lip products; wash hands frequently.
- **Transmission**: HSV is contagious even without visible lesions; avoid close contact during outbreaks [^11435F2m].

---

## Emerging therapies and research

Recent research includes **BCG vaccination**, which delayed recurrence in frequent sufferers, and **amenamevir**, a single-dose helicase-primase inhibitor that shortened healing in phase 3 trials; these are promising but not yet standard of care [^112h74d7] [^116epM1P].

---

## Summary of treatment recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended treatment** |
|-|-|
| Recurrent herpes labialis | Oral antivirals (acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir) at prodrome [^113uyWzS] |
| Oral therapy not feasible | Topical antivirals (penciclovir, acyclovir, docosanol) [^115XteTY] |
| Frequent recurrences (≥ 6/year) | Suppressive therapy (acyclovir, valacyclovir) [^1124kvYZ] |
| Supportive care | Analgesics, hydration, trigger avoidance [^notfound] |

---

Effective management of herpes labialis centers on **early antiviral therapy**, supportive care, and patient education, with suppressive therapy for frequent recurrences.

Background

Herpes simplex labialis (HSL), also known as cold sores, is a common disease of the lips caused by the herpes simplex virus, which is found throughout the world. It presents as a painful vesicular eruption, forming unsightly crusts, which cause cosmetic disfigurement and psychosocial distress. There is no cure available, and it recurs periodically.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for the prevention of HSL in people of all ages.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 19 May 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Oral Health Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2015), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), LILACS (from 1982), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, Airiti Library, and 5 trial registers. To identify further references to relevant randomised controlled trials, we scanned the bibliographies of included studies and published reviews, and we also contacted the original researchers of our included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for preventing HSL in immunocompetent people.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. A third author was available for resolving differences of opinion.

Main Results

This review included 32 RCTs, with a total of 2640 immunocompetent participants, covering 19 treatments. The quality of the body of evidence was low to moderate for most outcomes, but was very low for a few outcomes. Our primary outcomes were 'Incidence of HSL' and 'Adverse effects during use of the preventative intervention'. The evidence for short-term (≤ 1 month) use of oral aciclovir in preventing recurrent HSL was inconsistent across the doses used in the studies: 2 RCTs showed low quality evidence for a reduced recurrence of HSL with aciclovir 400 mg twice daily (risk ratio (RR) 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.51; n = 177), while 1 RCT testing aciclovir 800 mg twice daily and 2 RCTs testing 200 mg 5 times daily found no similar preventive effects (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.87; n = 237; moderate quality evidence and RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.07; n = 66; low quality evidence, respectively). The direction of intervention effect was unrelated to the risk of bias. The evidence from 1 RCT for the effect of short-term use of valaciclovir in reducing recurrence of HSL by clinical evaluation was uncertain (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.28; n = 125; moderate quality evidence), as was the evidence from 1 RCT testing short-term use of famciclovir. Long-term (> 1 month) use of oral antiviral agents reduced the recurrence of HSL. There was low quality evidence from 1 RCT that long-term use of oral aciclovir reduced clinical recurrences (1.80 versus 0.85 episodes per participant per a 4-month period, P = 0.009) and virological recurrence (1.40 versus 0.40 episodes per participant per a 4-month period, P = 0.003). One RCT found long-term use of valaciclovir effective in reducing the incidence of HSL (with a decrease of 0.09 episodes per participant per month; n = 95). One RCT found that a long-term suppressive regimen of valaciclovir had a lower incidence of HSL than an episodic regimen of valciclovir (difference in means (MD) -0.10 episodes per participant per month, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.05; n = 120). These trials found no increase in adverse events associated with the use of oral antiviral agents (moderate quality evidence). There was no evidence to show that short-term use of topical antiviral agents prevented recurrent HSL. There was moderate quality evidence from 2 RCTs that topical aciclovir 5% cream probably has little effect on preventing recurrence of HSL (pooled RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.72; n = 271). There was moderate quality evidence from a single RCT that topical foscarnet 3% cream has little effect in preventing HSL (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.40; n = 295). The efficacy of long-term use of topical aciclovir cream was uncertain. One RCT found significantly fewer research-diagnosed recurrences of HSL when on aciclovir cream treatment than on placebo (P < 0.05), but found no significant differences in the mean number of participant-reported recurrences between the 2 groups (P ≥ 0.05). One RCT found no preventive effect of topical application of 1,5-pentanediol gel for 26 weeks (P > 0.05). Another RCT found that the group who used 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclo dextrin 20% gel for 6 months had significantly more recurrences than the placebo group (P = 0.003). These studies found no increase in adverse events related to the use of topical antiviral agents. Two RCTs found that the application of sunscreen significantly prevented recurrent HSL induced by experimental ultraviolet light (pooled RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.33; n = 111), but another RCT found that sunscreen did not prevent HSL induced by sunlight (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.25 to 5.06; n = 51). These RCTs did not report adverse events. There were very few data suggesting that thymopentin, low-level laser therapy, and hypnotherapy are effective in preventing recurrent HSL, with one to two RCTs for each intervention. We failed to find any evidence of efficacy for lysine, LongoVital® supplementation, gamma globulin, herpes simplex virus (HSV) type I subunit vaccine, and yellow fever vaccine in preventing HSL. There were no consistent data supporting the efficacy of levamisole and interferon, which were also associated with an increased risk of adverse effects such as fever.

Authors' Conclusions

The current evidence demonstrates that long-term use of oral antiviral agents can prevent HSL, but the clinical benefit is small. We did not find evidence of an increased risk of adverse events. On the other hand, the evidence on topical antiviral agents and other interventions either showed no efficacy or could not confirm their efficacy in preventing HSL.

### Herpes labialis [^112TnzB1]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Herpes simplex virus type 1 infection usually causes a mild, self-limiting painful blistering around the mouth, with 20% to 40% of adults affected at some time. Primary infection usually occurs in childhood, after which the virus is thought to remain latent in the trigeminal ganglion. Recurrence may be triggered by factors such as exposure to bright light, stress, and fatigue.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of antiviral treatments for the first attack of herpes labialis? What are the effects of interventions aimed at preventing recurrent attacks of herpes labialis? What are the effects of treatments for recurrent attacks of herpes labialis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to February 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 27 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: oral antiviral agents, sunscreen, topical anaesthetic agents, topical antiviral agents, and zinc oxide cream.

### Current management and recommendations for access to antiviral therapy of herpes labialis [^113cyp97]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2012). Low credibility.

Herpes labialis is a common skin infective condition, worldwide, which is primarily caused by HSV-1. Recurrent episodes of herpes labialis, also known as cold sores, can be frequent, painful, long-lasting and disfiguring for infected patients. At present, there are two types of antivirals for the treatment of herpes labialis, topical and oral, which are available over the counter or as prescription-only. The aim of antiviral therapy is to block viral replication to enable shortening the duration of symptoms and to accelerate healing of the lesions associated with herpes labialis. This review examines the evidence for the effectiveness of current topical and oral antivirals in the management of recurrent episodes of herpes labialis. In most countries, oral antivirals for herpes labialis are available as prescription-only. However, in early 2010, the oral antiviral famciclovir was reclassified from prescription-only medicine to pharmacist-controlled status in New Zealand. The benefits and risks associated with moving an antiviral therapy for herpes labialis from prescription-only to pharmacist-controlled status are reviewed here, and the implications for patients, general physicians and pharmacists are considered.

### Oral antivirals for the acute treatment of recurrent herpes labialis [^1121q94H]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the use and benefit of oral antivirals in the acute treatment of episodic, recurrent herpes labialis.

Data Sources

A literature search was performed in MEDLINE (1966-August 2003) using acyclovir, famciclovir, valacyclovir, cold sores, herpes labialis, and HSV-1 as search terms.

Data Synthesis

We reviewed 5 placebo-controlled and 2 comparative studies evaluating oral antivirals for acute treatment of recurrent herpes labialis. No studies directly compared different antivirals. Studies discussing the efficacy of antivirals for chronic suppression of herpes simplex virus-1 infection were not included.

Conclusions

Treatment with oral antivirals decreases the duration of lesion episodes and pain by approximately one day; however, the antivirals do not abort lesions from developing. Clinical implications of these results appear relatively modest.

### Single-dose, patient-initiated famciclovir: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial for episodic treatment of herpes labialis [^116DfJ3L]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The brief period of viral replication in recurrent herpes labialis lesions suggests shorter therapeutic regimens are a logical episodic treatment strategy.

Objective

We sought to assess the efficacy and safety of single-dose and single-day famciclovir treatments.

Methods

In all, 701 randomly assigned patients self-initiated therapy with famciclovir (1500 mg once [single dose] or 750 mg twice a day for 1 day [single day]) or placebo within 1 hour of onset of the prodromal symptoms of an episode of herpes labialis. Lesion healing was monitored by diaries and frequent clinic visits.

Results

Median healing times of primary (first to appear) vesicular lesions in the famciclovir single-dose, famciclovir single-day, and placebo groups were 4.4, 4.0, and 6.2 days, respectively. There was no significant difference between the famciclovir regimens. Adverse events in the famciclovir groups were similar to placebo.

Limitations

The active arms of this trial were not directly compared to other antiviral regimens.

Conclusion

Single-dose famciclovir reduced time to healing of herpes labialis lesions by approximately 2 days compared with placebo.

### Valacyclovir [^111XPua3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Adult Patients

Cold Sores (Herpes Labialis)

Valacyclovir tablets are indicated for treatment of cold sores (herpes labialis). The efficacy of valacyclovir tablets initiated after the development of clinical signs of a cold sore (e.g., papule, vesicle, or ulcer) has not been established.

Genital Herpes

Initial Episode: Valacyclovir tablets are indicated for treatment of the initial episode of genital herpes in immunocompetent adults. The efficacy of treatment with valacyclovir tablets when initiated more than 72 hours after the onset of signs and symptoms has not been established.

Recurrent Episodes: Valacyclovir tablets are indicated for treatment of recurrent episodes of genital herpes in immunocompetent adults. The efficacy of treatment with valacyclovir tablets when initiated more than 24 hours after the onset of signs and symptoms has not been established.

Suppressive Therapy: Valacyclovir tablets are indicated for chronic suppressive therapy of recurrent episodes of genital herpes in immunocompetent and in HIV-1-infected adults. The efficacy and safety of valacyclovir tablets for the suppression of genital herpes beyond 1 year in immunocompetent patients and beyond 6 months in HIV-1-infected patients have not been established.

Reduction of Transmission: Valacyclovir tablets are indicated for the reduction of transmission of genital herpes in immunocompetent adults. The efficacy of valacyclovir tablets for the reduction of transmission of genital herpes beyond 8 months in discordant couples has not been established. The efficacy of valacyclovir tablets for the reduction of transmission of genital herpes in individuals with multiple partners and non-heterosexual couples has not been established. Safer sex practices should be used with suppressive therapy (see current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines).

Herpes Zoster

Valacyclovir tablets are indicated for the treatment of herpes zoster (shingles) in immunocompetent adults.

The efficacy of valacyclovir tablets when initiated more than 72 hours after the onset of rash and the efficacy and safety of valacyclovir tablets for treatment of disseminated herpes zoster have not been established.

### Clinical efficacy of topical docosanol 10% cream for herpes simplex labialis: a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^1178LD9k]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent herpes simplex labialis (HSL) occurs in 20% to 40% of the US population. Although the disease is self-limiting in persons with a healthy immune response, patients seek treatment because of the discomfort and visibility of a recurrent lesion.

Objective

Our purpose was to determine whether docosanol 10% cream (docosanol) is efficacious compared with placebo for the topical treatment of episodes of acute HSL.

Methods

Two identical double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted at a total of 21 sites. Otherwise healthy adults, with documented histories of HSL, were randomized to receive either docosanol or polyethylene glycol placebo and initiated therapy in the prodrome or erythema stage of an episode. Treatment was administered 5 times daily until healing occurred (ie, the crust fell off spontaneously or there was no longer evidence of an active lesion) with twice-daily visits.

Results

The median time to healing in the 370 docosanol-treated patients was 4.1 days, 18 hours shorter than observed in the 367 placebo-treated patients (P = 0.008; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2, 22). The docosanol group also exhibited reduced times from treatment initiation to (1) cessation of pain and all other symptoms (itching, burning, and/or tingling; P = 0.002; 95% CI: 3, 16.5); (2) complete healing of classic lesions (P = 0.023; 95% CI: 1, 24.5); and (3) cessation of the ulcer or soft crust stage of classic lesions (P < .001; 95% CI: 8, 25). Aborted episodes were experienced by 40% of the docosanol recipients versus 34% of placebo recipients (P = 0.109; 95% CI for odds ratio: 0.95, 1.73). Adverse experiences with docosanol were mild and similar to those with placebo.

Conclusion

Docosanol applied 5 times daily is safe and effective in the treatment of recurrent HSL. Differences in healing time compared favorably with those reported for the only treatment of HSL that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Penciclovir cream was studied in two double-blind, placebo (vehicle)-controlled trials for the treatment of recurrent herpes labialis in which otherwise healthy adults were randomized to either penciclovir cream or placebo. Therapy was to be initiated by the subjects within 1 hour of noticing signs or symptoms and continued for 4 days, with application of study medication every 2 hours while awake. In both studies, the mean duration of lesions was approximately one-half-day shorter in the subjects treated with penciclovir cream (N = 1,516) as compared to subjects treated with placebo (N = 1,541) (approximately 4.5 days versus 5 days, respectively). The mean duration of lesion pain was also approximately one half-day shorter in the penciclovir cream group compared to the placebo group.

### Human herpes simplex labialis [^115c8XK2]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Humans are the natural host for eight of more than 80 known herpes viruses. Infections with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) are ubiquitous worldwide and highly transmissible. Herpes simplex labialis (HSL) is the best-recognized recrudescent infection of the lips and perioral tissues caused by HSV-1. Facial lesions of HSL may be unsightly, frequent outbreaks unpleasant, and the infection itself more severe locally and systemically in immunocompromised people. This article highlights the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnostic features and management issues for HSL.

### Famciclovir [^1117HwzL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Herpes Labialis (Cold Sores)

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 701 immunocompetent adults with recurrent herpes labialis. Patients self-initiated therapy within 1 hour of first onset of signs or symptoms of a recurrent herpes labialis episode with famciclovir 1500 mg as a single dose (n = 227), famciclovir 750 mg twice daily (n = 220) or placebo (n = 254) for 1 day. The median time to healing among patients with non-aborted lesions (progressing beyond the papule stage) was 4.4 days in the famciclovir 1500 mg single-dose group (n = 152) as compared to 6.2 days in the placebo group (n = 168). The median difference in time to healing between the placebo and famciclovir 1500 mg treated groups was 1.3 days (95% CI: 0.6–2.0). No differences in proportion of patients with aborted lesions (not progressing beyond the papule stage) were observed between patients receiving famciclovir or placebo: 33% for famciclovir 1500 mg single dose and 34% for placebo. The median time to loss of pain and tenderness was 1.7 days in famciclovir 1500 mg single dose-treated patients vs. 2.9 days in placebo-treated patients.

Outcome measures

Questionnaires were completed by participants at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12-months of follow-up. In the baseline questionnaire, participants were asked demographic questions (including sex) and details about their previous history of cold sores, including age at first episode, number of cold sore episodes (overall and in the last year), use of treatment for cold sores, and impact of cold sores on quality of life. In the follow-up questionnaires, participants were asked whether they had had a cold sore recurrence since their last completed questionnaire, the frequency of episodes, when the first recurrence began, any treatment used for cold sores, and whether they noticed a change in cold sore recurrences in terms of frequency, duration, severity, and impact on quality of life.

The primary outcome for this nested study was the time from randomisation to first self-reported cold sore recurrence in the subset of participants with frequent recurrent herpes labialis, defined as reporting four or more cold sore recurrences in the preceding year at the baseline questionnaire. Secondary outcomes included the number of cold sore recurrences, proportion of participants with a cold sore recurrence, and proportion of participants with a perceived change in duration, severity, frequency, or impact on quality of life of cold sore recurrences (see Appendix).

### Common oral lesions… [^114V8hXG]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment goals include reducing lesion frequency, pain, and size. Application of topical corticosteroid gels or rinses is the primary therapy; however, quality studies lack support for any specific treatment. 2, 4 Systemic corticosteroids or intralesional triamcinolone may be used for more severe presentations. 1–3 Oral chlorhexidine rinse may decrease lesion severity and pain, but prolonged use stains the teeth. 3 Patients should avoid foods that trigger ulcers. Sodium lauryl sulfate may increase the irritation and pain from aphthous ulcers.

1. Blistering follows within 24 hours, becoming crusted, painful ulcerations that may bleed. 14, 17 Topical 5% acyclovir cream or topical penciclovir 1% cream applied every two hours at prodrome onset and used for five days decreases pain. 16 Over-the-counter 10% docosanol cream has a similar benefit.

14 Oral antivirals decrease pain and duration but must be started within 24 hours of onset. For initial infection, acyclovir in a dosage of 200 mg five times per day for 10 days is one option; valacyclovir, 1 g two times per day for 10 days, is an easier dosage regimen for patients. Recurrent herpes labialis is treated with valacyclovir, 2 g at prodrome and then 2 g 12 hours later. 16 Most individuals have two or fewer flareups of recurrent herpes labialis per year, but 5% to 10% experience six or more and may benefit from prophylactic valacyclovir, 500 mg two times per day. Asymptomatic disease requires no treatment. Topical corticosteroids are the primary treatment. Severe presentations may require therapy with systemic prednisone. 29 Localized lesions may be managed with topical fluocinonide or clobetasol gel or oral steroid rinses; oral dexamethasone rinses may be used for more widespread lesions.

25, 27, 29 Steroid-sparing options include topical calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus and hydroxychloroquine. 29 The potential for malignant transformation of oral lichen planus is uncertain, with a range of 0% to 12. 5% cited in the literature. 25–27, 29.

5.1	General

Penciclovir cream should only be used on herpes labialis on the lips and face. Because no data are available, application to human mucous membranes is not recommended. Particular care should be taken to avoid application in or near the eyes since it may cause irritation. Lesions that do not improve or that worsen on therapy should be evaluated for secondary bacterial infection. The effect of Penciclovir cream has not been established in immunocompromised patients.

### A phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating a single, patient-initiated dose of amenamevir for recurrent herpes labialis [^116epM1P]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Amenamevir (ASP2151), a novel, non-nucleoside analog, antiviral drug, inhibits the enzyme activities of helicase and primase, which are essential for replication of herpes viral genomic DNA. In this phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, the authors investigated the efficacy and safety of a single patient-initiated dose of amenamevir to treat recurrent herpes labialis. Adult immunocompetent patients with recurrent herpes labialis who had the experience and ability to recognize prodromal symptoms were randomly assigned to administer amenamevir 1200mg or placebo as a patient-initiated therapy within 6 hours after onset of prodromal symptoms. The primary efficacy end point was time to healing of all herpes labialis lesions in the modified intention-to-treat population. Secondary efficacy end points were time to crusting of all herpes labialis lesions, time to resolution of pain accompanying herpes labialis, proportion of patients with aborted lesions, and time to resolution of subjective symptoms accompanying herpes labialis. The modified intention-to-treat population, which excluded patients with aborted lesions, comprised 298 patients who self-initiated amenamevir and 307 who took placebo. Amenamevir demonstrated superiority over placebo for the primary end point; the median time to all lesion healing was 5.1days for amenamevir versus 5.5days for placebo (hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.46; p = 0.0085). Time to crusting of all lesions was significantly shorter with amenamevir versus placebo (p = 0.0065); there were no significant between-group differences in other secondary outcomes. Treatment-emergent adverse events in both groups were generally mild in severity; there were two moderate events that were judged unrelated to study treatment, and no severe or serious events. In summary, a single patient-initiated dose of amenamevir 1200mg taken within 6 hours of prodromal symptom onset significantly shortened the time to all lesion healing of recurrent herpes labialis compared with placebo, with no clinically important safety concerns.

### A randomised double-blind study comparing the effect of 1072-nm light against placebo for the treatment of herpes labialis [^116U123C]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Previous research demonstrated that 1072-nm narrowband laser light is effective in the treatment of cold sores.

Aim

To evaluate the efficacy of an over-the-counter cold-sore treatment device (Virulite CS) incorporating 1072-nm light-emitting diodes.

Methods

A randomised, prospective, double-blind, self-reported study was performed to compare the efficacy of at least six 3-min treatments of 1072-nm narrowband light against placebo, in the treatment of herpes labialis.

Results

The 1072-nm light-emitting diode device reduced cold-sore healing time to 6.3 days compared with 9.4 days for placebo (P = 0.048). The time the cold sore took to form a crust was also reduced from 2.00 days for those treated with 1072-nm light, compared with 2.88 days for placebo (P = 0.059)

Conclusions

The significant difference between the mean healing times in the two groups demonstrates that the Virulite CS device is an effective means of treating herpes labialis.

### Recurrent herpes labialis in adults: new tricks for an old dog [^113YxZ87]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Herpes labialis remains a common worldwide affliction. Recent advances in understanding the basic pathogenesis have led to new therapeutic intervention, both on-label and off-label. Aside from reducing the duration and symptomatology of acute outbreaks, another goal of treatment is to decrease the frequency of future episodes. Oral and topical acyclovir and its analogues are the mainstay of both chronic suppressive and episodic therapy. A new muco-adhesive formulation of acyclovir provides a decrease in outbreaks, probably due to a diminution of herpesvirus load in all reservoir sites. Acyclovir-resistant strains are rare in immunocompetent hosts; parenteral foscarnet and cidofovir are administered in this situation. Parenteral acyclovir is the drug of choice for eczema herpeticum, which may begin as herpes labialis in an atopic dermatitis patient. Thermotherapy may be beneficial, and a certified device to deliver heat is available outside the United States. <em> J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(3 Suppl):s49-53. </em>.

Primary outcome

Of the 84 individuals with frequent recurrent cold sores, 70 reported a recurrence (32/38 (84%) in the BCG group and 38/46 (83%) in the control group) with a median time to recurrence of 2.2 (IQR 1.6, 3.5) months after randomisation in the BCG group, compared with 1.8 (IQR 1.1, 4.2) months in the control group. The time to first cold sore recurrence was 1.55 months greater in the BCG group (95% CI 0.27–2.82, p 0.02) with a HR of 0.54 (95% CI 0.32–0.91; Fig. 2, Table 2). The beneficial effect of BCG on the time to first cold sore recurrence was greater in the as-treated population (difference 1.91 months, 95% CI 0.69–3.12, p 0.003; HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26–0.76; Table 2), and persisted in all the other sensitivity and supplementary analyses (Supplementary Tables S1–S3). In prespecified subgroup analyses (Fig. 2), only sex was associated with the treatment effect (p for treatment arm × sex interaction 0.007), with a difference in time to first cold sore recurrence of 5.20 (95% CI −0.14 to 10.53) months in males (HR 0.19, 95% CI 0.02–1.71), compared with 0.43 (95% CI −1.04 to 1.91) months in females (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.53–1.41).

### Topical iontophoretic administration of acyclovir for the episodic treatment of herpes labialis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinic-initiated trial [^113fe8Lz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple studies of the use of acyclovir for the treatment of herpes labialis have suggested that the nominal efficacy of the topical formulation is the result of inadequate penetration of the drug into the target site of infection, the basal epidermis.

Methods

We developed a low-voltage, wireless, hand-held, computer-controlled, iontophoretic applicator to enhance the skin penetration of topical acyclovir in the treatment of herpes labialis. We performed a multicenter, placebo-controlled, clinic-initiated, pilot trial of a single, topical, iontophoretic application of 5% acyclovir cream for the episodic treatment of herpes labialis among 200 patients with an incipient cold sore outbreak at the erythema or papular/edema lesion stage.

Results

The median classic lesion healing time (aborted lesions were assigned a value of 0 h) was 1.5 days shorter for the active treatment group than for the vehicle group (113 h vs. 148 h; P = 0.02). In the subgroup of patients who presented with lesions in the erythema stage, the median classic lesion healing time was 3 days shorter for the acyclovir group, compared with the control group (49 h vs. 120 h; P < .03), and the acyclovir group tended to have more aborted lesions than did the control group (46% vs. 24%; P = 0.10).

Conclusions

Single-dose topical iontophoresis of acyclovir appears to be a convenient and effective treatment for cold sores and merits further clinical investigation.

### Bacillus calmette-Guérin vaccination for protection against recurrent herpes labialis: a nested randomised controlled trial [^114zTHzb]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recurrent herpes labialis ('cold sore') is a common condition caused by reactivation of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the orofacial region.HSV-1 is endemic worldwide, infecting up to 95% of individuals, of whom between 14 and 40% have frequent recurrent cold sores. Recurrences can be debilitating and significantly reduce quality of life. Long-term suppressive therapy with an oral antiviral is somewhat effective in reducing the burden of HSV recurrences, but is costly, and involves the risk of adverse events. There is still no vaccine available against HSV.

In addition to its intended effects, the anti-tuberculosis vaccine, bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), induces off-target ('non-specific') effects that confer additional benefits. Examples of these immunomodulatory effects include reduction in all-cause mortality in infants, prevention and treatment of certain cancers, protection against progression of autoimmune diseases, and protection against a variety of viral infections. Observational studies suggest this includes the prevention of HSV recurrences. In a systematic review of observational studies, BCG vaccination was found to be beneficial in 78% of individuals with recurrent herpes labialis or genitalis, with 37% being recurrence-free for an extended period, 41% experiencing less frequent or severe episodes, and only 22% reporting no change. Albeit promising, these results have never been confirmed in a randomised controlled trial (RCT). The only RCT published to date, restricted to patients with herpes genitalis, had a number of limitations, in particular the use of a potentially beneficial intervention in the control group.

This study aimed to determine in a subgroup of adults with recurrent cold sores whether BCG vaccination compared with placebo reduces HSV recurrences in the BRACE RCT (BCG vaccination to reduce the impact of COVID-19 in healthcare workers). Secondary aims addressed a wider range of objectives, including the impact of BCG on the burden of recurrences and the risk of a first cold sore episode in sub-groups defined by differing frequencies of HSV recurrence.

### Evaluation of imiquimod 5% cream to modify the natural history of herpes labialis: a pilot study [^113V2Fms]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Imiquimod is currently approved for the treatment of genital warts and has been shown to decrease recurrences of genital herpes in the guinea pig model of genital herpes. Therefore, we evaluated the safety and potential of topical imiquimod to decrease the rate of recurrence in humans with a history of recurrent herpes labialis.

Methods

Forty-seven subjects with recurrent herpes labialis applied imiquimod 5% (n = 30) or vehicle cream (n = 17) to recurrent lesion(s) on days 1, 3, and 5 of the study (day 1 of observation occurred within 48 h after recurrence of lesion). Subjects were seen at the study centers between each dose and 3 days after application of the final dose or until resolution of the lesion.

Results

After application to recurrent lesions, local erythema, edema, scabbing and/or flaking, pain, burning, and maximal lesion size were significantly greater in the imiquimod group than in the vehicle group. The study was terminated early because of severe local adverse events that occurred in 5 recipients of imiquimod. The median time until the next recurrence was, however, increased from 50 days in the vehicle group to 91 days in the imiquimod group (P = 0.018).

Conclusions

Application of imiquimod 5% cream to herpes labialis lesions was associated with a delay in the time to the first recurrence after treatment, but severe local inflammation occurred in some individuals.

### Valaciclovir as a single dose during prodrome of herpes facialis: a pilot randomized double-blind clinical trial [^111VCrQP]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized clinical trials of valaciclovir in recurrent herpes labialis are lacking.

Objectives

To determine whether a single course of valaciclovir, i.e. 500, 1000 or 2000 mg, administered during the prodrome of herpes facialis, could be beneficial.

Methods

Three hundred and forty-five out-patients with herpes labialis were screened and randomized for a multicentre, double-blind clinical trial. Ninety-six patients had no recurrence after 6 months of follow-up; 249 patients were finally included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. The main outcome measure was the rate of aborted episodes at day 3. The three treatment groups were similar at baseline.

Results

There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in rates of aborted lesions at day 3 in the ITT population, in particular between the 500 mg and 2000 mg treatment groups.

Conclusions

Although a placebo group was not included in this pilot study, a single dose of valaciclovir was not considered beneficial in patients with recurrent herpes facialis.

### Treatment of mucocutaneous presentations of herpes simplex virus infections [^116n95aP]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Infections by herpes simplex virus (HSV) types I and II are diverse and quite frequent. After primary infection, the virus establishes a life-long latency in the sensory ganglia and recrudescences may occur at an unpredictable rate. Recurrent labial and genital herpes infections represent the majority of clinical manifestations of HSV infections. Their management is currently well established using evidence-based medicine data. Primary labial herpes is generally not treated with antivirals in otherwise healthy children, although intravenous aciclovir may be offered in severe primary infections, particularly in the immunocompromised patient. The decision whether or not to treat recurrent labial herpes should be evaluated individually and depends on the frequency and severity of relapses, the impairment of the quality of life, and the cost of therapy. Patients with mild disease may benefit from topical therapy, and those with severe and frequent recurrences may be considered for intermittent or long-term oral antiviral therapy. Primary genital herpes is treated with oral or intravenous antivirals, depending on the severity of the infection and associated symptoms. Recurrent genital herpes can be managed with episodic short courses of oral antivirals in patients whose recurrences are moderate to severe and rare, and have a clear prodrome. Patients with > 5 episodes/year, severe recurrences or unrecognisable prodromes may be best managed with long-term suppressive antiviral prophylaxis. HSV is also responsible for a variety of other clinical manifestations, including herpetic whitlow, neonatal infection, disseminated and atypical cutaneous infections, traumatic herpes, eczema herpeticum, and HSV-associated erythema multiforme. HSV infection may also represent a complication following cosmetic procedures of the oro-facial region, surgical and dental interventions, sun exposure and burns.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Only for topical use of herpes labialis on the lips and face. (5)

5.1	General

DENAVIR should only be used on herpes labialis on the lips and face. Because no data are available, application to human mucous membranes is not recommended. Particular care should be taken to avoid application in or near the eyes since it may cause irritation. Lesions that do not improve or that worsen on therapy should be evaluated for secondary bacterial infection. The effect of DENAVIR has not been established in immunocompromised patients.

11 Management EPISODIC ORAL TREATMENT FOR PRIMARY HERPETIC GINGIVOSTOMATITIS. EPISODIC ORAL TREATMENT FOR RECURRENT HERPES LABIALIS In a Cochrane review on the treatment of herpes labialis in patients receiving cancer treatment, acyclovir was found to be effective with regard to viral shedding; time to first decrease in pain; complete resolution of pain; and total healing. 13 The brief period of viral replication in recurrent herpes labialis lesions suggests short therapeutic regimens should produce good results. In one RCT, 701 patients self-initiated therapy with famciclovir or placebo within one hour of prodromal symptoms onset.

In one RCT of recurrent herpes labialis, treatment with oral valacyclovir plus topical clobetasol was compared with placebo. EPISODIC TOPICAL TREATMENT FOR RECURRENT HERPES LABIALIS Topical treatment for herpes labialis is less effective than oral treatment. An RCT of treatment with topical penciclovir 1% cream showed healing was marginally faster in the penciclovir group compared with placebo. 17 More than 90 percent of patients in both groups healed completely within 10 days. 17 Treatment with docosanol cream, when applied five times per day and within 12 hours of episode onset, is safe and somewhat effective. An RCT of healthy adults with a history of frequent herpes labialis recurrences evaluated treatment with 5% acyclovir cream versus a vehicle control. ORAL TREATMENT TO PREVENT HERPES LABIALIS RECURRENCES Oral acyclovir is effective in suppressing herpes labialis in immunocompetent adults with frequent recurrences.

In one RCT, treatment with oral acyclovir resulted in a 53 percent reduction in the number of clinical recurrences and a 71 percent reduction in virus culture-positive recurrences compared with placebo.

### Acyclovir for treating primary herpetic gingivostomatitis [^111CJ6d2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis is a highly contagious infection of the oral cavity which typically affects children but can also occur in adults. Symptoms may vary widely from mild discomfort to life-threatening encephalitis.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of systemic acyclovir for primary herpetic gingivostomatitis.

Search Strategy

We searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 22 May 2008); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 2); MEDLINE (1950 to 22 May 2008); and EMBASE (1980 to 22 May 2008). There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing acyclovir to placebo in children and young adults < 25 years of age with a diagnosis of primary herpetic gingivostomatitis with or without herpes labialis were considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently and in duplicate screened and extracted information from, and assessed the risk of bias in the included clinical trials. The Cochrane Collaboration statistical guidelines were followed for data synthesis.

Main Results

Only two clinical trials, one with 72 participants and the other with 20 participants were included in this review. The second study failed to report several methodological items and was inconsistent in its reporting of the outcomes measurement. The first trial, with a moderate risk of bias, showed better results in the acyclovir group compared to the placebo group in children < 6 years of age in reducing the number of individuals with oral lesions (risk ratio (RR) 0.10 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.38)), new extraoral lesions (RR 0.04 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.65)), difficulty in eating (RR 0.14 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.58)), and drinking difficulties (RR 0.11 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.83)) after 8 days of treatment. Following the onset of treatment, three patients from the placebo group were admitted to hospital for rehydration (P = 0.11). Four children (two from the acyclovir, and two from the placebo group) showed mild gastrointestinal symptoms that resolved spontaneously after 24 to 48 hours without a change in the study treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

We found two relevant trials in this systematic review, only one of them could provide some weak evidence that acyclovir is an effective treatment in reducing the number of oral lesions, preventing the development of new extraoral lesions, decreasing the number of individuals with difficulties experienced in eating and drinking and reducing hospital admission for children under 6 years of age with primary herpetic gingivostomatitis.

Study in Patients with Recurrent Herpes Labialis (cold sores)

The efficacy and safety of SITAVIG was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, patient-initiated, multicenter trial comparing SITAVIG 50 mg administered as a single dose (n = 378) to placebo (n = 397) in patients with recurrent herpes labialis (cold sores). A total of 376 SITAVIG treated patients and 395 placebo treated patients were included in the Intent to Treat (ITT) efficacy population defined as all patients who took study treatment and who had a start date and time of treatment initiation recorded. The mean age was 41.0 years (range: 18–80 years) and the majority of patients were female (68.6%), and Caucasian (94.9%). All patients had at least 4 herpes episodes in the previous year of whom 68.4% had ≥ 5 episodes. Patients were instructed to initiate treatment within one hour after the onset of prodromal symptoms and before the appearance of any signs of herpes labialis lesions by applying the tablet to the buccal mucosa in the canine fossa. If the tablet was detached within the first 6 hours, subjects were instructed to reapply a tablet.

The mean and median durations of the recurrent herpes labialis episode (ITT population, n = 771) were approximately half a day shorter in patients treated with SITAVIG compared with patients treated with placebo.

14.1 Adult Subjects

ZOVIRAX Cream was evaluated in two double-blind, randomized, placebo (vehicle)-controlled trials for the treatment of recurrent herpes labialis. The average patient had five episodes of herpes labialis in the previous 12 months. In the first trial, the median age of subjects was 37 years (range 18 to 81 years), 74% were female, and 94% were Caucasian. In the second trial, median age of subjects was 38 years (range 18 to 87 years), 73% were female, and 94% were Caucasian. Subjects were instructed to initiate treatment within 1 hour of noticing signs or symptoms and continue treatment for 4 days, with application of study medication 5 times per day. In both studies, the mean duration of the recurrent herpes labialis episode was approximately one-half day shorter in the subjects treated with ZOVIRAX Cream (n = 682) compared with subjects treated with placebo (n = 703) for approximately 4.5 days versus 5 days, respectively. No significant difference was observed between subjects receiving ZOVIRAX Cream or placebo in the prevention of progression of cold sore lesions.

14.2 Pediatric Subjects

An open-label, uncontrolled trial with ZOVIRAX Cream was conducted in 113 patients aged 12 to 17 years with recurrent herpes labialis. In this trial, therapy was applied using the same dosing regimen as in adults and subjects were followed for adverse events. The safety profile was similar to that observed in adults.

Statistical analysis

The statistical analysis plan was finalised before unblinding (see Appendix). Sample size calculations were based on the primary outcomes of incidence of severe and symptomatic COVID-19 in the BRACE trial. Participants were included under their randomised treatment group, as per the intention-to-treat principle. Our target estimate was the difference in restricted mean survival time (RMST, i.e. time free from first cold sore recurrence) over 12-months of follow-up and 95% confidence intervals (CI), estimated using a flexible parametric survival (Royston-Parmar) model on the log cumulative hazard scale, standardised for stratification factors used during randomisation (age group, presence of comorbidity, geographical location, and study stage). Assuming the proportional hazards assumption was found to be reasonable, we also presented hazard ratios (HR) and their corresponding 95% CI. Participant data were censored at 12-months of follow-up; otherwise, data were censored at loss to follow-up or at the time of latest survey completion date without missing outcome data. Therefore, RMST can be interpreted as the average time before first cold sore recurrence restricted to 12 months follow-up (or to 12 months follow-up in those without recurrence). For clarity, this will be referred to as the 'time to first cold sore recurrence'.

Binary outcomes were summarised as between group model-fitted marginal risk differences (RD) and 95% CI estimated using binomial regression models adjusted for stratification factors. The frequency of cold sore episodes over 12 months was summarised as an incidence rate ratio (IRR) and 95% CI estimated using a negative binomial regression model adjusted for stratification factors.

Supplementary analyses were done in different subsets of participants: (i) in participants who ever had a cold sore (i.e. who reported having any number of previous cold sore episodes at baseline); (ii) in participants who reported 1 or more cold sore episodes in the preceding year; (iii) in participants who reported 2 or more cold sore episodes in the preceding year; and (iv) in participants who previously never had a cold sore. Sensitivity analyses were done: (i) limiting data to that ascertained through 3-month recall; (ii) in hypothetical scenarios in which suppressive therapy was not available (censoring data at initiation of suppressive therapy); and (iii) in the as-treated population, with participants analysed according to the intervention they received.

### Efficacy and safety of aciclovir mucoadhesive buccal tablet in immunocompetent patients with labial herpes (LIP trial): a double-blind, placebo-controlled, self-initiated trial [^113p8yzG]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Single-day, high-dose systemic antiviral drugs are effective in the treatment of labial herpes (herpes labialis [HL]). Aciclovir Lauriad® mucoadhesive buccal tablet (ABT) is an innovative drug delivery system providing high and prolonged exposure to aciclovir in the oral cavity, supporting its evaluation as a single low dose in HL.

Methods

In this multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled patient-initiated trial, 775 patients with recurrent HL were randomly assigned to either a single application of ABT 50 mg or a matching placebo as soon as prodromal symptoms occurred. The primary endpoint was the time to healing (TTH) of primary vesicular lesion (modified intention-to-treat population). Other endpoints included incidence of blocked episodes, duration of herpes episodes, and incidence and time to next recurrence evaluated during a 9-month follow-up period (intention-to-treat population).

Results

With ABT 50 mg, median TTH of primary vesicular lesion was reduced (7 days vs 7.3 days, P = 0.015), the incidence of blocked herpes episodes was increased by 24.2% (34.9% vs 28.1%; P = 0.042), and the median duration of herpes episodes was reduced (5.6 days vs 6.4 days, P = 0.003). During the 9-month follow-up period, recurrence of herpes lesions was less frequent (64.2% vs 73.6%; P = 0.027) and delayed (205 days vs 165 days, P = 0.041) in the ABT 50 mg. Both treatments were safe.

Conclusion

A single application of ABT improves all endpoints of HL and might modify its clinical course in decreasing the incidence and delaying the onset of the next recurrence.

Discussion

This is the first RCT in which the efficacy of BCG vaccination to reduce cold sore recurrence is assessed. In individuals with frequent recurrent cold sore episodes, we found a 53% increase in the mean time spent without a recurrence over the 12 months following BCG vaccination, together with a decrease in the self-reported burden of cold sore recurrences. Although, participants in the BCG group were more likely to use oral therapy during follow up, a higher proportion of participants in the control group reported using it for a longer period, to prevent cold sores. BCG vaccination had the highest impact on individuals with frequent recurrent cold sore episodes. A decrease in cold sore burden was observed in participants with less frequent cold sore recurrences, but of lower magnitude. The effect of BCG on delaying time to first cold sore recurrence was greater in the as-treated population, supporting this being a true beneficial effect of the intervention.

Overall, the benefit of BCG vaccination was mainly qualitative (e.g. decreased severity of episode, lower impact of episode on quality of life), rather than quantitative (e.g. proportion of participant with a recurrence, number of recurrences). This highlights the need to include outcome measures that are clinically relevant in clinical trials, as even small changes, which may be difficult to capture with quantitative measures alone, can significantly impact individuals' everyday lives.

Previous observational studies reporting the impact of BCG vaccination on HSV have involved a total of 127 individuals with recurrent cold sores and 162 with recurrent herpes genitalis. In the two studies restricted to individuals with recurrent cold sores, nearly all participants benefitted from BCG vaccination, with 48% remaining recurrence-free and 45% clearly improving, with fewer or less severe recurrences.

### Exploring BCG vaccination as a novel approach to prevent recurrent herpes labialis [^111sQU9T]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Nonetheless, the study by Pittet and colleagues is a unique and innovative contribution to the literature. It compared the protective effect of BCG vaccination against recurrent herpes labialis between sexes and suggested an increased risk of primary cold sore occurrence following BCG vaccination. The results imply that BCG-induced non-specific immune responses have the potential to enhance the body's immune response, but they may also exacerbate existing inflammatory or immune-related diseases. Therefore, when utilising BCG-induced non-specific immune responses for disease prevention or treatment, the population's immune state and underlying diseases should be considered. Well-designed studies are necessary to avoid potential adverse effects and meticulous evaluation and analysis should be conducted, maximising the beneficial effects of the various immunological responses induced by BCG.

Secondary outcomes

During the 12-month follow-up, a greater proportion of participants with frequent recurrent cold sores in the BCG group compared with the control group reported a decrease in duration (61% vs 21%; RD 42%, 95% CI 20–64%), severity (74% vs 21%; RD 54%, 95% CI 34–75%) and perceived frequency (55% vs 21%; RD 35%, 95% CI 13–57%) of cold sore recurrences (Table 2, Fig. 3). In addition, a greater proportion of participants in the BCG group compared with the control group reported a reduction in the impact of cold sores on their quality of life (42% vs 15%; RD 25%, 95% CI 4–47%; Table 2). There was no difference between the groups in the proportion of participants reporting any cold sore recurrence, or the total number of cold sore recurrences reported (Table 2).

Supplementary analyses in all participants who previously ever had a cold sore

In the analyses done in the 1894 participants who ever had a cold sore, there were differences in the proportion of participants reporting a perceived decrease in duration (32% vs 17%; RD 15%, 95% CI 9–22%), severity (36% vs 16%; RD 21%, 95% CI 14–27%), frequency (30% vs 14%; RD 15%, 95% CI 9–21%), and impact on quality of life (23% vs 11%; RD 12%, 95% CI 6–17%) of cold sore episodes in the BCG group compared with the control group (Table 2, Fig. 3). The magnitude of decrease in severity was proportional to the frequency of cold sore recurrences in the year preceding inclusion (Table 2, Fig. 3). There was no difference between the two groups in the time to first recurrence, the proportion of participants reporting a cold sore recurrence, or the number of cold sore recurrences (Table 2).

### Multicenter randomized study of inosine pranobex versus acyclovir in the treatment of recurrent herpes labialis and recurrent herpes genitalis in Chinese patients [^115f76ph]. The Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral inosine pranobex as compared with acyclovir in the treatment of recurrent herpes labialis (RHL) and recurrent herpes genitalis (RHG). A multicenter double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, controlled, parallel group trial was conducted in 144 patients with RHL and 144 RHG. Patients were assigned to treatment in one of two groups: (i) inosine pranobex group (active inosine pranobex, 1 g four times daily, and acyclovir placebo); or (ii) acyclovir group (active acyclovir, 200 mg five times daily, and inosine pranobex placebo). The total symptom score (TSS) of patients with RHL did not differ in the inosine pranobex and acyclovir group on the 3rd or 7th day of treatment. There was also no difference in the efficacy rates between the two groups. No difference of TSS was observed between patients with RHG taking inosine pranobex and acyclovir on days 3 or 5 of the treatment, respectively. The short-term clinical recurrence rate of RHG at 3-month follow-up was much lower in the inosine pranobex group than acyclovir group. The incidence of hyperuricemia was higher in the inosine pranobex group than acyclovir group. In conclusion, inosine pranobex was as effective as acyclovir in treating RHL and RHG with significantly greater reduction of the short-term recurrence rate of herpes genitalis at 3-month follow up. Long-term recurrence rates at 6 months or longer remain to be determined. Hyperuricemia should be monitored during the treatment.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

HIV-associated HSV — considerations for starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) — Orolabial and genital HSV should not influence the decision on when to start ART in persons with HIV. Transient increases in HSV-2–associated genital ulcers have been observed during the first 6 months after initiation of ART in HIV/HSV-2 coinfected persons; in such cases, suppressive anti-HSV therapy can be considered. The frequency and severity of clinical episodes of genital herpes is often reduced in individuals after immune reconstitution on ART; however, immune reconstitution does not reduce the frequency of genital HSV shedding.

### A helicase-primase drug candidate with sufficient target tissue exposure affects latent neural herpes simplex virus infections [^111Eov11]. Science Translational Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

More than 50% of the world population is chronically infected with herpesviruses. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are the cause of herpes labialis (cold sores), genital herpes, and sight-impairing keratitis. Less frequently, life-threatening disseminated disease (encephalitis and generalized viremia) can also occur, mainly in immunocompromised patients and newborns. After primary infection, HSV persists for life in a latent state in trigeminal or sacral ganglia and, triggered by diverse stimuli, disease recurs in more than 30% of patients up to several times a year. Current therapy with nucleoside analogs targeting the viral polymerase is somewhat effective but limited by poor exposure in the nervous system, and latent infections are not affected by therapy. Here, we report on an inhibitor of HSV helicase-primase with potent in vitro anti-herpes activity, a different mechanism of action, a low frequency of HSV resistance, and a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile. Improved target tissue exposure results in superior efficacy in preventing and treating HSV infection and disease in animal models as compared to standard of care. Therapy of primary HSV infections with drug candidate IM-250 {(S)-2-(2',5'-difluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)- N -methyl- N -(4-methyl-5-(S -methylsulfon-imidoyl)thiazol-2-yl)acetamide} not only reduces the duration of disease symptoms or time to healing but also prevents recurrent disease in guinea pigs. Treatment of recurrent infections reduces the frequency of recurrences and viral shedding, and, unlike nucleosidic drugs, IM-250 remains effective for a time after cessation of treatment. Hence, IM-250 has advantages over standard-of-care therapies and represents a promising therapeutic for chronic HSV infection, including nucleoside-resistant HSV.

### Suppressive therapy versus episodic therapy with oral valacyclovir for recurrent herpes labialis: efficacy and tolerability in an open-label, crossover study [^112neubN]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Oral valacyclovir's efficacy and tolerability as suppressive therapy versus episodic therapy were compared for recurrent herpes labialis (RHL). Subjects with a history of at least 3 RHL episodes in the past year were randomized to receive 6 months of oral valacyclovir episodic therapy at the first sign of prodrome (two 2-g doses separated by 12 hours) and 6 months of oral valacyclovir suppressive therapy (1 g once daily) for 6 months in open-label, crossover fashion. The mean ± SE number of recurrences per 120 days of follow-up (primary endpoint) was lower with suppressive therapy (0.30 ± 0.41) than episodic therapy (0.71 ± 0.79) (P < .005). The probability of remaining recurrence free over 6 months was significantly higher with suppressive therapy than episodic therapy. The median time to first recurrence was 81 days with episodic therapy and was not calculable (> 180 days) for suppressive therapy (P = 0.021). Data for secondary efficacy endpoints (pain severity score, mean duration of recurrences, maximal total lesion area) showed approximately a 30% to 50% reduction in mean values with suppressive therapy compared with episodic therapy, but results were statistically significantly different between the regimens for pain severity only. The percentage of subjects with at least one adverse event over 6 months of treatment that was considered to be drug related was 3% with suppressive therapy and 6% with episodic therapy. Suppressive therapy with oral valacyclovir was more effective than episodic therapy with oral valacyclovir in reducing the frequency of recurrences of herpes labialis and prolonging the time to first recurrence and was also similarly well-tolerated.

### Recurrent aphthous stomatitis… [^112gPCMA]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis usually involves nonkeratinizing mucosa. There are three clinical forms: minor, major, and herpetiform. The minor form is the most common and appears as rounded, well-demarcated, single or multiple ulcers less than 1 cm in diameter that usually heal in 10 to 14 days without scarring. Most patients with mild aphthae require no treatment or only periodic topical therapy. Commonly used therapies include topical corticosteroids, such as fluocinonide gel and triamcinolone acetonide with carboxymethylcellulose paste. However, much of the evidence in support of these treatments is from small, incompletely blinded trials, and thus their effectiveness is uncertain. 36, 37 Chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash decreases the severity of an episode but does not reduce the incidence of ulcers. 15 Amlexanox 5% paste may promote healing and lessen pain.

16 In severe or constantly recurring cases, systemic therapy with agents such as thalidomide may be necessary. Because of the risk of serious adverse effects and its off-label status, thalidomide generally is reserved for severe cases such as those associated with HIV infection.
17. The condition typically waxes and wanes, and the lesions demonstrate a migrating pattern. Some patients may complain of pain or burning, especially when eating spicy foods. However, most individuals are asymptomatic and do not require treatment for this benign condition. For symptomatic cases, several treatments have been proposed, including topical steroids, zinc supplements, and topical anesthetic rinses. None of these treatments has been proven to be uniformly effective.
18. Classic lesions of reticular form often are readily identified clinically. However, lesions that do not exhibit classic features may require biopsy for diagnosis.

Asymptomatic patients do not require treatment. For symptomatic patients, topical corticosteroid gels, such as fluocinonide and corticosteroid mouth rinses, may be prescribed. 22 There is debate about whether oral lichen planus is associated with an increased risk of oral cancer. 40 Therefore, periodic follow-up of patients is appropriate.

### Bacillus calmette-Guérin vaccination for protection against recurrent herpes labialis: a nested randomised controlled trial [^112h74d7]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Recurrences of herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the orofacial region (herpes labialis or cold sores) impact quality-of-life. We aimed to study whether the bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine can attenuate cold sore recurrences through off-target immunomodulatory effects.

Methods

In this nested randomised controlled trial within the multicentre, phase 3 BRACE trial, 6828 healthcare workers were randomised in 36 sites in Australia, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom and Brazil, to receive BCG-Denmark or no BCG (1:1 ratio using a web-based procedure) and followed for 12 months with 3-monthly questionnaires. Exclusion criteria included contraindication to BCG vaccine or previous vaccination with BCG within the past year, any other live-attenuated vaccine within the last month, or any COVID-specific vaccine. The intervention group received one intradermal dose of 0.1 mL of BCG-Denmark corresponding to 2–8 × 10⁵ colony forming units of Mycobacterium bovis, Danish strain 1331. The primary outcome was the difference in restricted mean survival time (i.e. time to first cold-sore recurrence), in participants with frequent recurrent herpes labialis (≥ 4 recurrences/year), analysed by intention-to-treat. Secondary outcomes addressed additional questions, including analyses in other sub-populations. Adverse events were monitored closely during the first 3 months and were reported in all participants who received one dose of study drug according to intervention received. The BRACE trial is registered with.

Findings

Between March 30, 2020 and February 18, 2021, 84 individuals with frequent recurrent cold sores were randomly assigned to BCG (n = 38) or control (n = 46). The average time to first cold-sore recurrence was 1.55 months longer in the BCG group (95% CI 0.27–2.82, p = 0.02) than the control group (hazard ratio 0.54, 95% CI 0.32–0.91; intention-to-treat). The beneficial effect of BCG was greater in the as-treated population (difference 1.91 months, 95% CI 0.69–3.12, p = 0.003; hazard ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.26–0.76). In prespecified subgroup analyses, only sex modified the treatment effect (interaction p = 0.007), with benefit restricted to males. Over 12 months, a greater proportion of participants in the BCG group compared with the control group reported a decrease in duration (61% vs 21%), severity (74% vs 21%), frequency (55% vs 21%), and impact on quality of life (42% vs 15%) of cold sore recurrences. In participants who had ever had a cold sore, there was also a decrease in self-reported burden of recurrences in the BCG group. In participants who had never had a cold sore, there was an increased risk of a first episode in the BCG group (risk difference 1.4%; 95% CI 0.3–2.6%, p = 0.02). There were no safety concerns.

Interpretation

BCG-Denmark vaccination had a beneficial effect on herpes labialis, particularly in males with frequent recurrences, but may increase the risk of a first cold sore.

Genital herpes, caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 or type 2, is a prevalent sexually transmitted infection (STI). Given that HSV is an incurable infection, there are important concerns about appropriate use of diagnostic tools, management of infection, prevention of transmission to sexual partners, and appropriate counseling. In preparation for updating the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) STI treatment guidelines, key questions for management of genital herpes infection were developed with a panel of experts. To answer these questions, a systematic literature review was performed, with tables of evidence including articles that would change guidance assembled. These data were used to inform recommendations in the 2021 CDC STI treatment guidelines.

### Exploring BCG vaccination as a novel approach to prevent recurrent herpes labialis [^112b4utp]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In eClinicalMedicine, Laure F Pittet and colleagues published their phase 3 clinical trial that was conducted across multiple countries to assess the impact of BCG vaccination on recurrent herpes labialis.84 patients with frequent episodes of herpes labialis were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the BCG group (n = 38) or the control group (n = 46). The results demonstrated that, over a 1-year follow-up period, the BCG group experienced reduced duration, frequency, severity, and impact on quality of life related to recurrent herpes labialis than did the control group. Furthermore, in the BCG-immunised individuals, the time to the first recurrence was extended by 1.55 months compared with the control group (p = 0.02), indicating potential benefits of BCG vaccination for individuals with herpes labialis (p = 0.003). Subgroup analysis revealed that the benefits of BCG vaccination were primarily observed in male participants. A 2020 systematic review also demonstrated the benefits of BCG vaccination for 78% of adult patients with recurrent genital or herpes labialis, with 37% experiencing long-term remission and a reduction in outbreak frequency or severity by 41%. Although these results differ from a 1985 observational clinical trial by J M Douglas and colleagues — which found that BCG vaccination did not significantly reduce the recurrence rate of genital herpes or prolong the time to the first recurrence — discrepancies may be attributed to variations in sample size, BCG vaccine types, dosage, administration methods, and the immunological status and genetic backgrounds of vaccine recipients.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

See FDA-Approved Patient Labeling.

17.1 Importance of Adequate Hydration

Patients should be advised to maintain adequate hydration.

17.2 Cold Sores (Herpes Labialis)

Patients should be advised to initiate treatment at the earliest symptom of a cold sore (e.g., tingling, itching, or burning). There are no data on the effectiveness of treatment initiated after the development of clinical signs of a cold sore (e.g., papule, vesicle, or ulcer). Patients should be instructed that treatment for cold sores should not exceed 1 day (2 doses) and that their doses should be taken about 12 hours apart. Patients should be informed that valacyclovir hydrochloride is not a cure for cold sores.

17.3 Genital Herpes

Patients should be informed that valacyclovir hydrochloride is not a cure for genital herpes. Because genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease, patients should avoid contact with lesions or intercourse when lesions and/or symptoms are present to avoid infecting partners. Genital herpes is frequently transmitted in the absence of symptoms through asymptomatic viral shedding. Therefore, patients should be counseled to use safer sex practices in combination with suppressive therapy with valacyclovir hydrochloride. Sex partners of infected persons should be advised that they might be infected even if they have no symptoms. Type-specific serologic testing of asymptomatic partners of persons with genital herpes can determine whether risk for HSV-2 acquisition exists.

Valacyclovir hydrochloride has not been shown to reduce transmission of sexually transmitted infections other than HSV-2.

If medical management of a genital herpes recurrence is indicated, patients should be advised to initiate therapy at the first sign or symptom of an episode.

There are no data on the effectiveness of treatment initiated more than 72 hours after the onset of signs and symptoms of a first episode of genital herpes or more than 24 hours after the onset of signs and symptoms of a recurrent episode.

There are no data on the safety or effectiveness of chronic suppressive therapy of more than 1 year's duration in otherwise healthy patients. There are no data on the safety or effectiveness of chronic suppressive therapy of more than 6 months' duration in HIV-infected patients.

17.4 Herpes Zoster

There are no data on treatment initiated more than 72 hours after onset of the zoster rash. Patients should be advised to initiate treatment as soon as possible after a diagnosis of herpes zoster.

### Interventions for men and women with their first episode of genital herpes [^112AYUJo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Genital herpes is incurable, and is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). First-episode genital herpes is the first clinical presentation of herpes that a person experiences. Current treatment is based around viral suppression in order to decrease the length and severity of the episode.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of the different existing treatments for first-episode genital herpes on the duration of symptoms and time to recurrence.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (from inception to April 2016), MEDLINE (from inception to April 2016), the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group (from inception to April 2016), EMBASE (from inception to April 2016), PsycINFO (from inception to April 2016), CINAHL (from inception to April 2016), LILACS (from inception to April 2016), AMED (from inception to April 2016), and the Alternative Medicines Specialised Register (from inception to April 2016). We handsearched a number of relevant journals, searched reference lists of all included studies, databases of ongoing trials, and other Internet databases.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on participants with first-episode genital herpes. We excluded vaccination trials, and trials in which the primary objective assessed a complication of HSV infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

All studies written in English were independently assessed by at least two review authors for inclusion, risk of bias for each trial, and to extract data. Studies requiring translation were assessed for inclusion, trial quality, and data extraction by external translators.

Main Results

We included 26 trials with 2084 participants analysed. Most of the studies were conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US), and involved men and women experiencing their first episode of genital herpes, with the exception of three studies which included only women. We rated the majority of these studies as having an unclear risk of bias; largely due to lack of information supplied in the publications, and due to the age of the trials. This review found low quality evidence from two studies of oral acyclovir, when compared to placebo, reduced the duration of symptoms in individuals undergoing their first episode of genital herpes (mean difference (MD) -3.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.91 to -0.54; I(2) = 52%). In two studies (112 participants), intravenous acyclovir decreased the median number of days that patients with first-episode herpes suffered symptoms. Oral valaciclovir (converted to acyclovir) also showed a similar length of symptom duration when compared to acyclovir in two studies. There is currently no evidence that topical acyclovir reduces symptoms (MD -0.61 days, 95% CI -2.16 to 0.95; 3 RCTs, 195 participants, I(2) statistic = 56%). There is also no current evidence that the topical treatments of cicloxolone cream, carbenoxolone sodium cream, adenosine arabinoside, idoxuridine in dimethyl sulfoxide, when compared to placebo reduced the duration of symptoms in people undergoing their first episode of herpes. Two studies reported no evidence of a reduction in the number of median days to recurrence following treatment with oral acyclovir versus placebo. Adverse events were generally poorly reported by all of the included studies and we were unable to quantitatively analyse this outcome. For those taking acyclovir, there were no serious adverse events; the most common adverse events reported for oral acyclovir were coryza, dizziness, tiredness, diarrhoea and renal colic. For intravenous acyclovir these were phlebitis, nausea and abnormal liver function tests and for topical acyclovir there was pain with the topical application. Those undergoing interferon treatment had significantly more adverse events compared to those taking placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low quality evidence from this review that oral acyclovir reduced the duration of symptoms for genital herpes. However, there is low quality evidence which did not show that topical antivirals reduced symptom duration for patients undergoing their first episode of genital herpes. This review was limited by the inclusion of skewed data, resulting in few trials that we were able to meta-analyse.

Trial profile.

Of the 6447 participants who answered the baseline HSV questions, 1894 (29.4%) participants reported having had at least one cold sore episode in their life and, of these, 84/1633 (5.1%) (1.4% of all participants) reported frequent episodes with four or more recurrences in the year preceding inclusion. Age at first episode, number of cold sore episodes in the last year, and self-reported impact of cold sores on quality of life are detailed in Table 1. During follow up, 30 participants with frequent recurrent cold sores reported using oral therapy for cold sores: 19 in the BCG group and 11 in the control group (including 4/19 (21%) and 5/11 (45%) using long-term therapy to prevent recurrences, respectively).

### Famciclovir [^1151JqLC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Genital herpes: Clinical information on genital herpes in children is limited. Therefore, efficacy data from adults cannot be extrapolated to this population. Further, famciclovir has not been studied in children 1 to less than 12 years of age with recurrent genital herpes. None of the children in Study 2 had genital herpes.

Herpes labialis: There are no pharmacokinetic and safety data in children 1 to less than 12 years of age to support a famciclovir dose that provides penciclovir systemic exposures comparable to the penciclovir systemic exposures in adults after a single dose administration of 1500 mg. Moreover, no efficacy data have been obtained in children 1 to less than 12 years of age with recurrent herpes labialis.

Study 3 was an open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and antiviral activity of a single 1500 mg dose (three 500 mg tablets) of famciclovir in children 12 to less than 18 years of age with recurrent herpes labialis. A total of 53 subjects were enrolled in the study; 10 subjects in the pharmacokinetic part of the study and 43 subjects in the non-pharmacokinetic part of the study. All enrolled subjects weighed greater than or equal to 40 kg. The 43 subjects enrolled in the non-pharmacokinetic part of the study had active recurrent herpes labialis and received a single 1500 mg dose of famciclovir within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms (median time to treatment initiation was 21 hours). The safety profile of famciclovir observed in this study was similar to that seen in adults. The median time to healing of patients with non-aborted lesions was 5.9 days.

In a phase 3 trial in adults in which patients received a single 1500 mg dose of famciclovir or placebo, the median time to healing among patients with non-aborted lesions was 4.4 days in the famciclovir 1500 mg single-dose group and 6.2 days in the placebo group. Of note, in the adult study treatment was initiated by patients within 1 hour after the onset of symptoms [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Based on the efficacy results in Study 3, famciclovir is not recommended in children 12 to less than 18 years of age with recurrent herpes labialis.

Herpes simplex virus alternative agents and approvals — valacyclovir and famciclovir dosing: Valacyclovir is approved for immunocompetent adults and adolescents with first-episode mucocutaneous HSV at a dose of 1 g/dose by mouth BID for 7–10 days; also approved for recurrent herpes labialis in children ≥ 12 years using two, 2 g doses by mouth separated by 12 hours as single-day therapy. Recurrent genital HSV can be treated with valacyclovir 500 mg BID for 3 days or 1 g by mouth daily for 5 days. Immunocompetent adults with recurrent herpes labialis can be treated with famciclovir, 1 g/dose by mouth BID for 1 day. Famciclovir is approved to treat primary genital HSV in immunocompetent adults at a dose of 250 mg/dose by mouth TID for 7–10 days, and Recurrent genital HSV is treated with famciclovir 1 g/dose by mouth BID at a 12-hour interval for 2 doses. In HIV-infected adults and adolescents, Famciclovir is approved for use in HIV-infected adults and adolescents with recurrent mucocutaneous HSV infection at a dose of 500 mg/dose by mouth BID for 7 days. Counseling notes specify that There is no pediatric preparation of valacyclovir (although crushed capsules can be used to make a suspension according to specific instructions provided in the U.S. FDA package insert) and data on dosing in children are limited. Valacyclovir can be used by adolescents able to receive adult dosing, and that Famciclovir is available in a sprinkle formulation with weight-adjusted dosing. Famciclovir can be used by adolescents able to receive adult dosing.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-Approved Patient Labeling (Medication Guide，available at www.wprx- .com/prescription-catalog).

Importance of Adequate Hydration

Patients should be advised to maintain adequate hydration.

Missed Dose

Instruct patients that if they miss a dose of valacyclovir tablets, to take it as soon as they remember. Advise patients not to double their next dose or take more than the prescribed dose.

Cold Sores (Herpes Labialis)

Patients should be advised to initiate treatment at the earliest symptom of a cold sore (e.g., tingling, itching, or burning). There are no data on the effectiveness of treatment initiated after the development of clinical signs of a cold sore (e.g., papule, vesicle, or ulcer). Patients should be instructed that treatment for cold sores should not exceed 1 day (2 doses) and that their doses should be taken about 12 hours apart. Patients should be informed that valacyclovir tablets is not a cure for cold sores.

Genital Herpes

Patients should be informed that valacyclovir tablets is not a cure for genital herpes. Because genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease, patients should avoid contact with lesions or intercourse when lesions and/or symptoms are present to avoid infecting partners. Genital herpes is frequently transmitted in the absence of symptoms through asymptomatic viral shedding. Therefore, patients should be counseled to use safer sex practices in combination with suppressive therapy with valacyclovir tablets. Sex partners of infected persons should be advised that they might be infected even if they have no symptoms. Type-specific serologic testing of asymptomatic partners of persons with genital herpes can determine whether risk for HSV-2 acquisition exists.

Valacyclovir tablets has not been shown to reduce transmission of sexually transmitted infections other than HSV-2.

If medical management of a genital herpes recurrence is indicated, patients should be advised to initiate therapy at the first sign or symptom of an episode.

There are no data on the effectiveness of treatment initiated more than 72 hours after the onset of signs and symptoms of a first episode of genital herpes or more than 24 hours after the onset of signs and symptoms of a recurrent episode.

There are no data on the safety or effectiveness of chronic suppressive therapy of more than 1 year's duration in otherwise healthy patients. There are no data on the safety or effectiveness of chronic suppressive therapy of more than 6 months' duration in HIV-1-infected patients.

### Safety and tolerability of combination acyclovir 5% and hydrocortisone 1% cream in adolescents with recurrent herpes simplex labialis [^1147wKsr]. Pediatric Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

A Phase 3, open-label, multicenter study was conducted to assess the safety of the combination of 5% acyclovir and 1% hydrocortisone cream (AHC cream) in the treatment of recurrent herpes simplex labialis (HSL) in immunocompetent adolescents. Eligible subjects were aged 12 to 17 years and had a history of recurrent labial herpes with two or more episodes during the last 12 months. Subjects initiated treatment at the first signs or symptoms of a herpes recurrence-at the earliest prodromal phase and preferably before the presence of papules or vesicles. Subjects applied the cream topically five times per day for 5 days. Adverse events, categorization of recurrence (ulcerative or nonulcerative), and maximum lesion area (maximum area of an ulcerative lesion) were assessed. Of the 134 subjects analyzed for safety, 131 had data for categorization of recurrence at the post-treatment visit 3 ± 1 weeks after the last dose. Seventy-eight subjects (59.5%) had nonulcerative recurrences, and 53 (40.5%) had ulcerative recurrences. All 131 subjects reached the stage of normal skin, with no signs or symptoms, at the follow-up visit. The mean maximum lesion area in the 53 subjects with ulcerative herpes lesion was 39 mm². Five subjects reported five adverse events (secondary herpes labialis recurrences, n = 2; infectious rhinitis, n = 1; application site inflammation, n = 1; bronchial asthma, n = 1). All adverse events were of mild to moderate intensity. The results of this study demonstrate that the combination of AHC cream is well tolerated in the treatment of recurrent HSL in adolescents.

### A pilot study of treatment of herpes labialis with 1072 nm narrow waveband light [^117R4CcT]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

A randomized prospective double-blind study was performed to compare the efficacy of a single 5 min 1072 nm narrow waveband light application against topical aciclovir applied five times daily in the treatment of herpes labialis. Treatment was initiated within 36 h of the onset of symptoms and the end point was defined as the day that the crust was discarded leaving an uninterrupted underlying skin at the site of the cold sore. The results demonstrated that a single 5 min light treatment significantly reduced cold sore healing time by 4 days; 1072 nm light healed cold sores in 4.3 ± 1.8 days (mean ± SD) as compared with aciclovir applied five times daily, 8.5 ± 3.0 days (P < 0.0001).

### A review of common pediatric lip lesions: herpes simplex / recurrent herpes labialis, impetigo, mucoceles, and hemangiomas [^1124j51u]. Clinical Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Lip lesions are a common presentation to the pediatrician's office. These lesions are often benign in children, without significant functional morbidity. However, owing to the prominent placement of lips and their role in communication, lip lesions can be alarming to patients as well as to their parents. For these reasons the pediatrician has an important role in recognizing, diagnosing, and treating the various types of labial dermatoses that commonly present to a pediatric practice. Four of the most common lip lesions a pediatrician will see are herpes simplex/recurrent herpes labialis, impetigo, mucoceles, and hemangiomas. This paper reviews the current literature on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of these 4 lesions.

### Nongenital herpes simplex virus [^111w5Ysk]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Nongenital herpes simplex virus type 1 is a common infection usually transmitted during childhood via nonsexual contact. Most of these infections involve the oral mucosa or lips (herpes labialis). The diagnosis of an infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 is usually made by the appearance of the lesions (grouped vesicles or ulcers on an erythematous base) and patient history. However, if uncertain, the diagnosis of herpes labialis can be made by viral culture, polymerase chain reaction, serology, direct fluorescent antibody testing, or Tzanck test. Other nonoral herpes simplex virus type 1 infections include herpetic keratitis, herpetic whitlow, herpes gladiatorum, and herpetic sycosis of the beard area. The differential diagnosis of nongenital herpes simplex virus infection includes aphthous ulcers, acute paronychia, varicella-zoster virus infection, herpangina, herpes gestationis (pemphigoid gestationis), pemphigus vulgaris, and Behçet syndrome. Oral acyclovir suspension is an effective treatment for children with primary herpetic gingivostomatitis. Oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are effective in treating acute recurrence of herpes labialis (cold sores). Recurrences of herpes labialis may be diminished with daily oral acyclovir or valacyclovir. Topical acyclovir, penciclovir, and docosanol are optional treatments for recurrent herpes labialis, but they are less effective than oral treatment.

### Public awareness and knowledge of herpes labialis [^115xcii9]. Journal of Medical Virology (2012). Low credibility.

Between 20% and 40% of the population is estimated to suffer from episodes of recurrent herpes labialis, although few reports in the literature have addressed the public awareness of this infection in the general population. The aims of this study were to determine the existing level of awareness and knowledge of this disease and to assess the source of this knowledge, the ability of the public to recognize the characteristics of the disease and the behavior of patients with clinical cases of disease manifestation. To this end, 2,000 individuals (961 male and 1,039 female) of 14 years of age and older were surveyed using the ECOcapi system [Eurisko Consumer Omnibus-CAPI (computer-assisted personal interviewing) version]. Eighty-nine percent of those surveyed had some knowledge of herpes labialis; 92% were able to refer to at least one symptom of herpes labialis, 91% were able to identify correctly his infection from pictures, and 45% had experienced personally at least one episode of herpes labialis infection. The majority of the individuals suffering from herpes labialis self-medicated using a topical therapy. Women were found to be affected more commonly by herpes labialis than men [OR 1.42 (1.18–1.70)], and women were also more likely to recognize the disease [OR 1.65 (1.30–2.08)] and to seek medical advice for the condition [OR 1.38 (1.12–1.70)]. In conclusion, herpes labialis is a common and well-known condition, and it is often self-diagnosed correctly, as the prodromal phase and the use of self-medication are very common.

### Progress in meeting today's demands in genital herpes: an overview of current management [^115yW1b7]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Treatment of genital herpes requires accurate diagnosis, patient support, and effective treatment. Diagnosis is usually straightforward for classic presentations characterized by vesicular lesions but can be challenging for atypical presentations, which are more common. Diagnosis of asymptomatic infection requires access to molecular technology or type-specific serologic assays. Misconceptions about herpes simplex infection are common and patient education is essential. Patient concerns extend beyond disease frequency and severity-the psychological impact should not be underestimated. Antiviral therapy is relevant at all stages of infection. Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are effective and well tolerated for genital herpes treatment. Continuous suppressive therapy controls all symptoms of recurrent disease and helps to relieve disease complications. The prodrugs valacyclovir and famciclovir offer easier, less-frequent dosing than required for acyclovir. Valacyclovir achieves effective suppression when taken once a day. Interventions to prevent genital herpes transmission and to control the global problem are urgently required.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adults

In a double-blind, clinical trial, 1,443 subjects with recurrent labial herpes were randomized to receive XERESE, 5% acyclovir in XERESE vehicle or vehicle alone. Subjects had, on average, 5.6 episodes of herpes labialis in the previous 12 months. The median age was 44 years (range 18 to 80 years), 72% were female, and 91% were Caucasian. Subjects were instructed to initiate treatment within 1 hour of noticing signs or symptoms and continue treatment for 5 days, with application of study medication 5 times per day. Ulcerative cold sores occurred in 58% of the subjects treated with XERESE compared to 74% in subjects treated with vehicle and 65% in subjects treated with 5% acyclovir in XERESE vehicle. The mean time to skin normalization was approximately 1.6 days shorter in the subjects treated with XERESE compared to vehicle. Clinical signs in terms of size of the cold sore and symptoms such as tenderness were reduced with XERESE as compared to vehicle.

14.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Subjects

An open-label safety trial in adolescents with recurrent herpes labialis was conducted in 134 subjects. Subjects had, on average, 4 episodes of herpes labialis in the previous 12 months. The median age was 14 years (range 12 to 17 years); 50% were female and all were Caucasian. XERESE was applied using the same dosing regimen as in adults and subjects were monitored for adverse events and selected efficacy parameters. The safety profile of XERESE appeared similar to that observed in adults.

An open-label safety trial in children with recurrent herpes labialis was conducted in 54 subjects, who averaged an episode of herpes labialis 2 months prior to trial entry. The mean age was 9 years (range 6 to 11 years); 57% were female and 90% were Caucasian. XERESE was applied using the same dosing regimen as in adolescents and adults and subjects were monitored for adverse events and select efficacy parameters. The safety profile of XERESE appeared similar to that observed in adults.

### Exploring BCG vaccination as a novel approach to prevent recurrent herpes labialis [^11199NNj]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

According to WHO, approximately 3.7 billion individuals under the age of 50 years (67%) carry herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), the primary cause of herpes labialis. Although medication can alleviate symptoms, it cannot cure the infection and recurrence may occur. The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is the only approved attenuated vaccine for tuberculosis prevention. Research suggests that BCG vaccination induces three types of non-specific immune responses: trained immunity, heterologous immunity, and anti-inflammatory effects. These immune responses have been used to prevent and treat a range of diseases, including HSV-1, human papillomavirus, and COVID-19,(Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Non-specific immune response induced by BCG. BCG immunisation or MTB infection of the human body induces an increase in gene rearrangement and metabolism of intrinsic immune cells, such as macrophages, NK cells, and monocytes, resulting in an increase in the secretion of cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. During re-infection with other pathogens like HSV-1, these trained innate immune cells will rapidly secrete a large amount of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and other cytokines to kill and eliminate invading pathogens.

### Early treatment of cold sores with topical ME-609 decreases the frequency of ulcerative lesions: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, patient-initiated clinical trial [^111FDGPm]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Prior pilot studies support the use of antiviral medications with topical corticosteroids for herpes simplex labialis (HSL). ME-609 (Xerese, Xerclear) is a combination of 5% acyclovir and 1% hydrocortisone developed for the topical treatment of HSL.

Objectives

The primary study end point was the prevention of ulcerative HSL lesions.

Methods

In all, 2437 patients with a history of HSL were randomized to self-initiate treatment with ME-609, 5% acyclovir in ME-609 vehicle, or ME-609 vehicle (placebo) at the earliest sign of a cold sore recurrence. Cream was applied 5 times/d for 5 days. A total of 1443 patients experienced a recurrence and initiated treatment with ME-609 (n = 601), acyclovir (n = 610), or placebo (n = 232).

Results

Of patients receiving ME-609, 42% did not develop an ulcerative lesion compared with 35% of patients receiving acyclovir in ME-609 vehicle (P = 0.014) and 26% of patients receiving placebo (P < .0001). In patients with ulcerative lesions, healing times were reduced in the ME-609 and acyclovir groups compared with placebo (P < .01 for both). The cumulative lesion area for all lesions was reduced 50% in patients receiving ME-609 compared with the placebo group (P < .0001). There were no differences among groups in the number of patients with positive herpes simplex virus cultures. The side-effect profile was similar among treatments.

Limitations

The study did not contain a group treated with a topical corticosteroid alone.

Conclusions

ME-609 prevented progression of cold sores to ulcerative lesions and significantly reduced the cumulative lesion area compared with acyclovir and placebo. ME-609 treatment offers additional therapeutic benefit compared with therapy with topical acyclovir alone.
