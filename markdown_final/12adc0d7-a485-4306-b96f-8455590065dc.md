## Question

For nausea and vomiting in pregnancy at 11 weeks, which meds are okay — Zofran in the first trimester versus Reglan?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antiemetic medications, specifically ondansetron (Zofran) versus metoclopramide (Reglan), are okay and safest to use at 11 weeks' gestation, and how to decide between them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline maternal–fetal risks of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) at 11 weeks and the consequences of undertreatment. Then, I should review first-line nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic options to ensure appropriate sequencing before second-line agents. Next, I will evaluate ondansetron's safety, efficacy, and dosing, followed by metoclopramide's safety, efficacy, and dosing. Finally, I will compare both agents head-to-head to frame a clinical recommendation and counseling approach grounded in guideline and regulatory positions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and background risks at 11 weeks. NVP affects most pregnancies, typically peaking around 8–12 weeks, and while often self-limited, severe cases carry risks of dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, weight loss, and adverse pregnancy outcomes if undertreated, particularly in hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) [^114vo1ry] [^11535q4t]. I should also remind myself that baseline major congenital malformation risk is about 2–4% and miscarriage risk 15–20% in the general population, independent of drug exposure, which is important for risk framing during counseling [^111mdY5w].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about second-line drugs until I verify first-line sequencing. I need to check that lifestyle and dietary measures plus pyridoxine with or without doxylamine, and then antihistamines and phenothiazines, are recognized first-line choices before escalating, because this sequencing both aligns with guidelines and may obviate the need for dopamine antagonists or 5‑HT3 antagonists in some patients [^111y87uc] [^115FSe8q]. Let me also consider simple contributors such as iron-containing prenatal vitamins that worsen nausea and can be modified early, and remember that validated severity tools (e.g. PUQE) can guide stepwise therapy and reassessment timelines [^112QEeyr] [^115MLMAv].

> Now, I will examine ondansetron's safety position. RCOG 2024 explicitly supports ondansetron as safe in pregnancy and advises not to discourage its use when first-line antiemetics are ineffective, with balanced counseling about a very small increase in absolute risk of orofacial clefting with first-trimester exposure, whereas ACOG and SOGC position it as an adjunct for severe NVP after failure of other combinations; FDA labeling emphasizes that epidemiologic findings are inconsistent and limited, precluding definitive conclusions, but postmarketing data have not shown increased miscarriage or adverse maternal outcomes [^1114UojN] [^114Jf5uj] [^113ZnDMK] [^1152F18B] [^113iaCZv].

> Wait, let me verify the fetal risk signal more precisely. One large case–control analysis reported a modest association between first-trimester ondansetron and cleft palate (adjusted OR ~1.6), but the absolute excess risk is very small; other large observational cohorts did not show overall increases in major congenital malformations, and FDA notes key methodological limitations such as confounding by indication and uncertainty of ingestion, so I should present this as a possible small risk signal within otherwise largely reassuring aggregate data [^1154t3iE] [^112wEXW2] [^1152F18B] [^1135ZsjY].

> I need to ensure maternal safety considerations are addressed for ondansetron. QT prolongation, particularly with IV dosing and in patients with electrolyte disturbances, is the principal concern; ECG monitoring is reasonable in high-risk patients or when combining QT‑prolonging drugs, and rare serotonin syndrome has been reported with multi‑serotonergic regimens, so medication reconciliation is essential before prescribing [^111CfjQZ] [^114tGFgv].

> Next, I should review metoclopramide's safety posture. RCOG recommends metoclopramide as a second-line agent alone or in combination when initial therapies fail, and multiple population and regulatory summaries do not show increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes or congenital malformations; metoclopramide crosses the placenta but has not demonstrated teratogenicity in animal studies at multiples of the human dose, and SOGC lists it as an adjunctive option in NVP [^112uZSX6] [^111mdY5w] [^1162C1Xj] [^notfound].

> Let me consider maternal adverse effects and duration limits for metoclopramide carefully. Extrapyramidal symptoms such as dystonia and akathisia can occur, particularly with rapid IV administration, and the FDA boxed warning highlights the risk of irreversible tardive dyskinesia with prolonged use beyond 12 weeks, especially in women; slow IV push over at least 3 minutes reduces acute EPS risk, and neonatal EPS is a peripartum consideration rather than a first‑trimester one [^111mdY5w] [^112uZSX6]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "limit total therapy to 12 weeks", but I should double-check the EMA-influenced recommendations; indeed, some authorities recommend limiting to 10 mg three times daily for up to 5 days to mitigate EPS risk, so I should correct myself and emphasize the shortest effective duration with frequent reassessment in pregnancy rather than any fixed prolonged course [^111CfjQZ] [^1154hqWY].

> I should confirm practical dosing next so recommendations are actionable. Typical ondansetron dosing used in pregnancy is 4 mg orally three times daily or 8 mg orally twice daily, and if IV is required, 8 mg infused over about 15 minutes every 12 hours with attention to electrolytes and QT risk; typical metoclopramide dosing is 10 mg orally three times daily or 5–10 mg IV every 6–8 hours, with slow IV administration to reduce EPS and planned short courses with reassessment [^111rrSzC] [^111wemaX] [^114NuWaN] [^1123fwP7] [^111HkVZ1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before comparing them head‑to‑head at 11 weeks. Both ondansetron and metoclopramide are considered clinically acceptable second‑line options after first‑line failure in the late first trimester, but many clinicians start with metoclopramide given its long history of use and the absence of a consistent teratogenic signal, reserving ondansetron for inadequate response or intolerance, with shared decision‑making about the very small, possibly increased orofacial cleft risk and the benefit of symptom control; this approach aligns with RCOG and ACOG positions and is consistent with large cohort reassurance regarding overall malformation risk [^112uZSX6] [^1114UojN] [^114U5zL1] [^112wEXW2].

> But wait, what if symptoms are severe or refractory and maternal intake is compromised. I should confirm escalation pathways, including combination antiemetics from different classes, thiamine supplementation in protracted vomiting, temporary cessation or modification of iron-containing prenatal vitamins, and consideration of ambulatory day‑care or inpatient management for IV fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition support to prevent complications of HG, with ongoing reassessment using validated severity tools to guide step‑up or de‑escalation [^112QEeyr] [^112kq1ea] [^115MLMAv] [^1164cbRP].

> In summary, I need to ensure the counseling reflects a balanced, reference‑based risk–benefit discussion. For metoclopramide, I will explain its extensive pregnancy safety data, emphasize potential restlessness or dystonia, use slow IV dosing if needed, and keep courses short with close follow‑up to mitigate tardive dyskinesia risk; for ondansetron, I will review high effectiveness, guideline support after first‑line failure, a very small and uncertain cleft risk signal, and the need to consider QT interactions and electrolyte status, reinforcing that the risks of undertreated moderate‑to‑severe NVP/HG often outweigh theoretical medication risks at this gestational age [^111mdY5w] [^1154hqWY] [^1114UojN] [^114Jf5uj] [^1152F18B].

---

At 11 weeks, **doxylamine-pyridoxine is first-line therapy** for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. If symptoms persist, **metoclopramide is a safe second-line** option with no proven teratogenic risk [^112uZSX6], although extrapyramidal effects may occur [^111mdY5w]. Ondansetron is effective but should be reserved for **refractory cases** [^114Jf5uj] [^1122WsJU], given a small possible increase in **orofacial clefts** with first-trimester use [^1154t3iE]; overall major malformation risk is not increased [^112wEXW2]. Use the lowest effective dose and monitor for side effects.

---

## First-line pharmacologic therapy

**Doxylamine-pyridoxine** is recommended as first-line therapy by ACOG and RCOG, with no increased risk of major malformations or adverse pregnancy outcomes. **Antihistamines (H1 receptor antagonists)** such as meclizine, dimenhydrinate, and promethazine are also safe and effective alternatives [^111y87uc].

---

## Second-line pharmacologic therapy

**Metoclopramide (Reglan)** is recommended as second-line therapy by ACOG and RCOG, with no increased risk of major malformations, miscarriage, or adverse outcomes [^111mdY5w]. Extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g. dystonia, akathisia) can occur, especially with prolonged use; limit duration to ≤ 12 weeks when possible [^1154hqWY] [^111mdY5w].

---

## Third-line pharmacologic therapy

**Ondansetron (Zofran)** is effective for refractory NVP and hyperemesis gravidarum [^1122WsJU]; some studies suggest a small increase in orofacial clefts with first-trimester use [^1154t3iE] [^1114UojN], but overall major malformation risk is not increased [^112wEXW2]. When possible, use after 10 weeks; if needed earlier, discuss risks and benefits with the patient.

## Comparative efficacy and safety: ondansetron vs. metoclopramide

| **Attribute** | **Ondansetron** | **Metoclopramide** |
|-|-|-|
| Efficacy | Effective for refractory NVP and hyperemesis gravidarum [^1122WsJU] | Effective for moderate-severe NVP [^112uZSX6] |
| Safety profile | Small possible increase in orofacial clefts with first-trimester use; overall major malformation risk not increased [^1154t3iE] [^112wEXW2] | No increased risk of major malformations; extrapyramidal symptoms possible [^111mdY5w] |
| Recommended use | Third-line; use after 10 weeks when possible | Second-line; limit to ≤ 12 weeks when possible |

## Clinical recommendations at 11 weeks gestation

- **First-line**: Doxylamine-pyridoxine or antihistamines (meclizine, dimenhydrinate, promethazine) [^114U5zL1].

- **Second-line**: Metoclopramide if first-line fails; monitor for extrapyramidal symptoms and limit duration [^112uZSX6] [^111mdY5w].

- **Third-line**: Ondansetron for refractory cases; use after 10 weeks when possible, with informed consent if earlier [^114Jf5uj] [^1114UojN].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Regular assessment**: Use validated tools (e.g. PUQE) to track severity and response [^115MLMAv].

- **Adverse effects**: Monitor for extrapyramidal symptoms with metoclopramide [^111mdY5w] and QT prolongation with ondansetron.

- **Patient education**: Discuss risks, benefits, and alternatives to support shared decision-making [^113Zgcdt].

---

At 11 weeks, **doxylamine-pyridoxine or antihistamines are first-line**; metoclopramide is a safe second-line option with monitoring, and ondansetron is reserved for refractory cases because of a small possible orofacial cleft risk [^114U5zL1].

### Reglan [^111mdY5w]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

The risk summary indicates that published studies, including retrospective cohort studies, national registry studies, and meta-analyses, do not report an increased risk of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes with the use of metoclopramide during pregnancy. There are potential risks to the neonate following exposure in utero to metoclopramide during delivery [see Clinical Considerations]. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with oral administration of metoclopramide to pregnant rats and rabbits at exposures about 6 and 12 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) [see Data].

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations**: Metoclopramide crosses the placental barrier and may cause extrapyramidal signs and methemoglobinemia in neonates with maternal administration during delivery. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal signs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

- **Data**:
	- **Animal data**: Reproduction studies have been performed following administration of oral metoclopramide during organogenesis in pregnant rats at about 6 times the MRHD calculated on body surface area and in pregnant rabbits at about 12 times the MRHD.

### Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy [^114vo1ry]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Low credibility.

More than half of pregnant women suffer from nausea and vomiting, which typically begins by the fourth week and disappears by the 16th week of pregnancy. The cause of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is unknown, but may be due to the rise in human chorionic gonadotrophin concentration. In 1 in 200 women, the condition progresses to hyperemesis gravidarum, which is characterised by prolonged and severe nausea and vomiting, dehydration, and weight loss.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatment for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy? What are the effects of treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 32 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupressure; acupuncture; corticosteroids; ginger; metoclopramide; ondansetron; prochlorperazine; promethazine; and pyridoxine (vitamin B6).

### Comparing the efficacy of prophylactic metoclopramide, ondansetron, and placebo in cesarean section patients given epidural anesthesia [^115pBton]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the relative efficacy of prophylactic metoclopramide, ondansetron, and placebo in nonemergent cesarean section patients given epidural anesthesia intraoperatively and during the first 24-hour period after delivery.

- **Design**: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted.

- **Setting**: The research took place in the inpatient obstetric unit of a university hospital center.

- **Patients**: The study involved 164 nonemergent cesarean section patients who were administered epidural anesthesia.

- **Intervention**: At the time of umbilical cord clamping, patients received intravenously (IV) either 4 mg ondansetron (Group O), 10 mg metoclopramide (Group M), or 10 mL normal saline (Group P).

- **Measurements and main results**: Episodes and severity of nausea and vomiting, rescue antiemetic requirement, patient satisfaction, and side effects were recorded. The frequency of intraoperative nausea was 24%, 43%, and 57% for Group O, Group M, and Group P, respectively (p < 0.03). The occurrence of nausea during the 24-hour study period was 26%, 51%, and 71% for Groups O, M, and P respectively (p < 0.03). The frequency of intraoperative and postoperative vomiting was similar between Group O and Group M but was significantly higher in Group P (p < 0.05). Overall patient satisfaction was highest in Group O compared with Groups P and M (p < 0.05). The maximum analog sedation score was higher in Group M compared to Groups O and P (p < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: In cesarean section patients given epidural anesthesia, prophylactic ondansetron, at 4 mg IV, proves more efficacious and yields higher patient satisfaction than metoclopramide, at 10 mg IV, or placebo in preventing intraoperative and postoperative nausea and vomiting.

### The management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^114RXFce]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2016). High credibility.

Regarding preventive measures for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, specifically concerning primary prevention, the SOGC 2016 guidelines recommend advising the early use of lifestyle and dietary modifications. Additionally, the guidelines endorse the use of antiemetics that were found to be effective in the index pregnancy to reduce the risk of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

### The onset of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: A prospective cohort study [^114HnKHA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) have been recognized as features of early pregnancy for well over 2000 years. Hippocrates, who lived from 460 to 370 BC, wrote, "when a woman who is suffering from neither rigours nor fever, develops amenorrhea and is liable to nausea, she is pregnant". Different national guidelines recommend various approaches to the management of NVP, with a wide range of recommendations.

The precise date and characteristics of its onset have been more difficult to define. Several papers that describe onset have collected data retrospectively by asking women to describe their onset when they attend their first antenatal clinic, often at around 12 weeks from the last menstrual period (LMP). Such retrospective data may be particularly unreliable if symptoms are mild and have subsided by the time of data collection.

In the Canadian study, 74% of women reported nausea. A study describing the onset and natural history of NVP asked women to present when they first thought they were pregnant to enter the study as early as possible to collect symptoms prospectively. This study reported entry at a median of day 57 from LMP. In that study, 58 (16%) of women out of a study population of 363 reported symptoms before entry, some of them up to 14 days before entry. Using LMP to date the onset of pregnancy nausea and vomiting may also be problematic. Some studies have shown that only 32% of women were certain of the date of their LMP. A higher incidence of round number preferences was recorded when women were asked the date of their LMP.

### Hormonal and psychological factors in nausea and vomiting during pregnancy [^116f8yhc]. Psychological Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The aetiology of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) is multifactorial, but the relative contribution of biological and psychological determinants is insufficiently understood. We examined the association of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), thyroid hormones (thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxin), and psychological factors with NVP.

- **Methods**: Blood chemistry and psychological measures were obtained from 1,682 pregnant women participating in the Holistic Approach to Pregnancy and the First Postpartum Year (HAPPY) study between 12 and 14 weeks of gestation. The presence of NVP was measured using the Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis scale. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Depression Scale. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the independent role of hCG, thyroid hormones, and depression as related to NVP, adjusting for age, body mass index, education, parity, smoking status, unplanned pregnancy, and history of depression.

- **Results**: Elevated levels of NVP were observed in 318 participants (18.9%). High hCG levels [odds ratio (OR) = 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.11–1.95], elevated depressive symptoms in the first trimester (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.15–2.43), and a history of depression (OR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.11–2.11) were independently related to high NVP. Multiparity (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.12–1.92) and younger age (OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.87–0.94) were also associated with high NVP, whereas (sub)clinical hyperthyroidism was not related to high NVP.

### Pharmacogenetic predictors of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy severity and response to antiemetic therapy: a pilot study [^1114dcWS]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

For patients with significant emesis, identifying pharmacogenetic predictors may be an important step in improving treatment strategies. If these findings are confirmed in larger studies, it is possible that women with certain serotonin receptor genotypes may be better suited for one antiemetic drug versus another or may require a higher starting dose of the drug. Alternate therapy might be prescribed based on genotype or patients may start therapy on multiple drugs rather than monotherapy. This could provide significant time and cost savings and offer much-needed symptom relief, potentially improving safety for both the mother and the fetus.

Our study was limited by a small sample size. This pilot study was not powered to find differences in secondary outcomes; however, the trends observed here will inform sample sizes for follow-up studies. There was also potential for recall bias. Nonetheless, validated measures were used, increasing the validity of the results. Another limitation is that the study did not mandate a specific nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) treatment algorithm and did not direct physician prescribing patterns in any way. As such, while the number of antiemetic medications given to each subject was used as a surrogate for the severity of NVP, it is confounded by variability in provider practice. Because standard practice is to start with one drug and add more to obtain symptom control, we believe this is a reasonable surrogate of symptom severity. We also did not measure treatment adherence. These results need to be validated in a larger cohort.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^1152F18B]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Pregnancy**:

	- **Risk summary**: Published epidemiological studies on the association between ondansetron use and major birth defects have reported inconsistent findings and have important methodological limitations that preclude conclusions about the safety of ondansetron use in pregnancy (see Data). Available postmarketing data have not identified a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal outcomes. Reproductive studies in rats and rabbits did not show evidence of harm to the fetus when ondansetron was administered during organogenesis at approximately 6 and 24 times the maximum recommended human oral dose of 24 mg/day, based on body surface area (BSA), respectively (see Data). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, miscarriages, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

	- **Data**:

		- **Human data**: Available data on ondansetron use in pregnant women from several published epidemiological studies preclude an assessment of a drug-associated risk of adverse fetal outcomes due to important methodological limitations, including the uncertainty of whether women who filled a prescription actually took the medication, the concomitant use of other medications or treatments, recall bias, and other unadjusted confounders.

### Prevention of nausea and vomiting during termination of pregnancy [^112LnLap]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2010). Low credibility.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is common in women undergoing dilatation and curettage under general anesthesia for pregnancy termination, and many studies suggest treating these women prophylactically for PONV.

- **Objectives**: Reviewing the antiemetics used over the past 20 years for this indication and comparing their efficacy.

- **Search strategy**: We performed MEDLINE and EMBASE searches for articles published from January 1980 through June 2009. The search terms were complications, nausea, vomiting, antiemetics, anesthetics, surgery, dilatation, curettage, pregnancy, and women.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected the studies of the antiemetics droperidol, metoclopramide, hydroxyzine, propofol, dexamethasone, ondansetron, and ramosetron when used for the stated indication. When assessing drug efficacy, we compared the antiemetics used at the time the article was written.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We reviewed the selected studies, presented the reported incidence rates of PONV for each drug, and presented and interpreted the P values reported for the different comparisons.

- **Main results**: Although all antiemetics assessed decreased the incidence of PONV, the combination of dexamethasone and droperidol seems to be the most effective in preventing PONV.

- **Conclusions**: All antiemetics used in the last 20 years to prevent PONV are effective (some more than others) in women undergoing dilatation and curettage for pregnancy termination. However, there is a need for benefit and risk analyses of the different treatments.

### Acog practice bulletin no. 189 summary: Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^113ZnDMK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the use of ondansetron hydrochloride IV (also known as Zofran) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if clearly needed. The ACOG and SOGC guidelines suggest ondansetron as an adjunctive therapy for severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy when other antiemetic combinations have failed. The RCOG guidelines suggest reassuring pregnant women about the very small increase in the absolute risk of orofacial clefting with ondansetron use in the first trimester, while also considering the risks of poorly managed hyperemesis gravidarum.

Ondansetron hydrochloride IV, also known as Zofran, is classified under category B1 in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed. Studies in animals have not shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 189 summary: Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^114Jf5uj]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the use of ondansetron hydrochloride PO (also known as Zofran) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, it should be used only if clearly needed. The ACOG and SOGC guidelines suggest ondansetron as an adjunctive therapy for severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy when other antiemetic combinations have failed. The RCOG guidelines suggest reassuring pregnant women about the very small increase in the absolute risk of orofacial clefting with ondansetron use in the first trimester, while also considering the risks of poorly managed hyperemesis gravidarum.

Ondansetron hydrochloride PO, known as Zofran, is classified under category B1 in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus being observed. Studies in animals have not shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage.

### The teratogenicity of drugs for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: Perceived versus true risk [^113Zgcdt]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Women and healthcare providers commonly overestimate the teratogenic risk of medications in pregnancy. With regard to nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, this leads to an underutilization of pharmacologic therapy. Pregnancy termination has even been elected in some circumstances when safe and effective alternatives for nausea have not been attempted. The misperception of teratogenic risk is partly the result of the way data on safety are presented. An awareness of this can lead to more balanced patient and physician educational materials.

To facilitate rational use of medicinal and nonmedicinal therapy for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, we have developed an algorithm based on a recent systematic review of safety and efficacy in management of the problem. The hierarchical use of medication is based on strength of evidence of fetal safety.

### Supportive medication in cancer during pregnancy [^1154hqWY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

Another agent that has been sufficiently examined for its compatibility with pregnancy and its potency against nausea and vomiting is metoclopramide. In utero exposure to metoclopramide during the first trimester was not associated with significantly increased risks of major congenital malformations, low birth weight, pre-term delivery, or perinatal death. Additionally, a very large study comparing pregnancy outcomes between exposed and unexposed mothers discovered no link between exposure and 20 individual major congenital malformation categories, spontaneous abortion, or stillbirth. Despite unanimity regarding metoclopramide's safety during pregnancy, some serious issues concern maternal side effects. Although comparable to ondansetron, metoclopramide is associated with an increased frequency of drowsiness and dry mouth. More importantly, prolonged administration — beyond 12 weeks — is correlated with the development of irreversible tardive dyskinesia (FDA black box warning), especially in females.

### Treating morning sickness in the United States — changes in prescribing are needed [^1168D1QG]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Presently, 97.7% of prescriptions for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy in the United States involve medications not labeled for use in pregnancy, not indicated for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, and not classified as safe in pregnancy by the Food and Drug Administration. The use of ondansetron for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy has increased from 50,000 monthly prescriptions in 2008 to 110,000 at the end of 2013, despite unresolved issues regarding fetal safety and FDA warnings about serious dysrhythmias. In April 2013, the FDA approved the combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine specifically for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy symptoms. Now that a safe and effective drug is available in the United States, there is no reason for women to be exposed to a drug of unproven maternal and fetal safety.

### Practice bulletin summary no. 153: Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^111Q7Szq]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is a common condition that affects the health of the pregnant woman and her fetus. It can diminish the woman's quality of life and significantly contribute to health care costs and time lost from work. Because "morning sickness" is common in early pregnancy, the presence of nausea and vomiting may be minimized by obstetricians, other obstetric providers, and pregnant women and, thus, undertreated. Furthermore, some women do not seek treatment because of concerns about the safety of medications. Once nausea and vomiting of pregnancy progresses, it can become more difficult to control symptoms; treatment in the early stages may prevent more serious complications, including hospitalization. Mild cases of nausea and vomiting may resolve with lifestyle and dietary changes, and safe and effective treatments are available for more severe cases. The woman's perception of the severity of her symptoms plays a critical role in the decision of whether, when, and how to treat nausea and vomiting. In addition, nausea and vomiting of pregnancy should be distinguished from nausea and vomiting related to other causes. The purpose of this document is to review the best available evidence about the diagnosis and management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

### Association of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy with pregnancy loss: A secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^1144eHPY]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy have been associated with a reduced risk for pregnancy loss. However, most prior studies enrolled women with clinically recognized pregnancies, thereby missing early losses.

- **Objective**: To examine the association of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy with pregnancy loss.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A randomized clinical trial, "Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction", enrolled women with 1 or 2 prior pregnancy losses at 4 US clinical centers from June 15, 2007, to July 15, 2011. This secondary analysis was limited to women with a pregnancy confirmed by positive results of a human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test. Nausea symptoms were ascertained from daily preconception and pregnancy diaries for gestational weeks 2 to 8. From weeks 12 to 36, participants completed monthly questionnaires summarizing symptoms for the preceding 4 weeks. A week-level variable included nausea only, nausea with vomiting, or neither.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Peri-implantation (hCG-detected pregnancy without ultrasonographic evidence) and clinically recognized pregnancy losses.

- **Results**: A total of 797 women (mean [SD] age, 28.7 [4.6] years) had an hCG-confirmed pregnancy. Of these, 188 pregnancies (23.6%) ended in loss. At gestational week 2, 73 of 409 women (17.8%) reported nausea without vomiting and 11 of 409 women (2.7%), nausea with vomiting. By week 8, the proportions increased to 254 of 443 women (57.3%) and 118 of 443 women (26.6%), respectively. Hazard ratios (HRs) for nausea were 0.50 (95% CI, 0.32–0.80) and nausea with vomiting.

### Antiemetic treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum in 1,064 Norwegian women and the impact of European warning on metoclopramide: A retrospective cohort study 2002–2019 [^116Nq5bv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are common pregnancy complaints, affecting nearly 70% of pregnant women to some degree, from mild to severe. Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is the most severe form of pregnancy sickness, which inhibits normal fluid and/or food intake and strongly limits activities of daily living. A global meta-analysis and a large UK population study found a prevalence of HG of 1.1% and 1.5%, respectively.

Secondary to persisting nausea and vomiting, HG can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, weight loss, and metabolic disturbances, which can be life-threatening if left untreated. In addition to maternal risks of anemia, hypertension, coagulopathy, and preeclampsia, HG is associated with low fetal birth weight and preterm birth. HG sufferers report symptoms that can be nearly unbearable, illustrated by findings that half of the HG patients in a large UK survey considered terminating the pregnancy, and one in four experienced occasional suicidal ideation. Additionally, there is a considerable risk of reoccurrence of HG in future pregnancies, and many who have had HG are reluctant to become pregnant again.

First-line antiemetics for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP)/HG have traditionally included antihistamines (meclizine, promethazine, and cyclizine) and dopamine antagonists (prochlorperazine and chlorpromazine) as these have reassuring evidence of safety in pregnancy. None of these has been demonstrated as significantly better in reducing NVP. If moderate NVP symptoms persist despite complementary treatment, guidelines in general recommend these options.

### Gastrointestinal factors in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^113k9Bvt]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this review is to outline gastrointestinal factors that may be relevant to nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Gastric neuromuscular dysfunctions of the stomach include abnormalities in gastric myoelectrical activity, gastric tone, and contractility, all of which may result in gastroparesis. These abnormalities in gastric neural activity and smooth muscle function are associated with nausea and vomiting in nonpregnant patients. Gastric dysrhythmias are disturbances of gastric pacesetter potential patterns that are present during the nausea of motion sickness, drug-induced nausea, in patients with diabetic gastropathy, and in women with nausea of pregnancy.

In pregnant women with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, standard gastrointestinal diseases such as gastroesophageal reflux, peptic ulcers, and cholecystitis must be considered. A diagnostic approach and therapeutic options for treating nausea and vomiting of pregnancy based on an understanding of gastric neuromuscular dysfunction is outlined.

### What are the costs associated with nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum? A systematic review [^113SmzdB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) is a common condition and can be a significant cause of morbidity for pregnant women. Up to 70–80% of pregnant women suffer from nausea in pregnancy, with additional vomiting experienced by 50%. The level of severity varies among affected individuals, with around 1–3% of women developing hyperemesis gravidarum (HG); however, this number could be substantially underestimated. HG is a condition characterized by severe, intractable nausea and/or vomiting, usually requiring hospital admission to manage associated dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, and other more severe complications such as preeclampsia and other hypertensive disorders.

The 2021 Windsor definition, developed using an international consensus process with all relevant stakeholders, has established the first international definition of HG to help achieve more uniformity in clinical studies and clinical management. The Windsor definition specifies criteria including symptoms beginning in early pregnancy (before 16 weeks' gestation), characterized by severe nausea and/or vomiting, inability to eat and/or drink normally, and a strong limitation on daily activities. HG is the primary cause of hospitalization in the first half of pregnancy.

NVP and HG can create substantial physical, psychological, and economic burdens for patients, significantly affecting a woman's quality of life and day-to-day functioning. While NVP is common, most women do not require medical intervention.

### Ondansetron [^113iaCZv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The risk summary for ondansetron use during pregnancy reveals that published epidemiological studies have reported inconsistent findings, with significant methodological limitations precluding definitive conclusions about its safety during pregnancy (see Data). Available postmarketing data have not identified a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal outcomes. Reproductive studies carried out on rats and rabbits did not indicate harm to the fetus when ondansetron was administered during organogenesis at doses approximately 6 and 24 times the maximum recommended human oral dose of 24 mg/day, based on body surface area (BSA), respectively (see Data).

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the indicated population is unknown. It is important to note that all pregnancies come with a background risk of birth defects, miscarriages, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

- **Data: Human data**: Available data on ondansetron use in pregnant women from several published epidemiological studies do not allow for an assessment of a drug-associated risk of adverse fetal outcomes. This is due to significant methodological limitations, including uncertainties about whether women who filled a prescription actually took the medication, the concurrent use of other medications or treatments, recall bias, and other unadjusted confounders.

### Treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum and nausea and vomiting in pregnancy: A systematic review [^1122WsJU]. JAMA (2016). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting affect approximately 85% of pregnant women. The most severe form, hyperemesis gravidarum, affects up to 3% of women and can have significant adverse physical and psychological sequelae.

- **Objective**: To summarize evidence on effective treatments for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum.

- **Evidence review**: Databases were searched up to June 8, 2016. Relevant websites and bibliographies were also searched. Titles and abstracts were assessed independently by two reviewers. Results were narratively synthesized; a planned meta-analysis was not possible because of heterogeneity and incomplete reporting of findings.

- **Findings**: Seventy-eight studies (n = 8,930 participants) were included: 67 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and 11 nonrandomized studies. Evidence from 35 RCTs at low risk of bias indicated that ginger, vitamin B6, antihistamines, metoclopramide (for mild symptoms), pyridoxine-doxylamine, and ondansetron (for moderate symptoms) were associated with improved symptoms compared with placebo. One RCT (n = 86) reported greater improvements in moderate symptoms following psychotherapy (change in Rhodes score [range, 0 {no symptoms} to 40 {worst possible symptoms}], 18.76 [SD, 5.48] to 7.06 [SD, 5.79] for intervention vs. 19.18 [SD, 5.63] to 12.81 [SD, 6.88] for comparator [p < 0.001]). For moderate-severe symptoms, one RCT (n = 60) suggested that a pyridoxine-doxylamine combination taken preemptively reduced the risk of recurrence of moderate-severe symptoms compared with treatment once symptoms begin (15.4% vs. 39.1% [p < 0.04]).

### Comparison of antiemetics for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in an emergency department setting [^1138M9QY]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

To compare the time from medication administration to disposition from the Emergency Department (ED) between women treated for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy with different antiemetic agents, we performed a retrospective cohort study. This study involved women 13 weeks gestation or less treated in our Women and Infants Hospital ED between 2009 and 2011. Data were collected on patient demographics, antiemetics used, and time to disposition. We analyzed the time from administration of the first-line antiemetic (ondansetron versus metoclopramide versus promethazine or prochlorperazine) to the time the discharge order was placed.

We analyzed data from 439 women treated in the ED for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Forty-four percent received ondansetron alone, 47% received any other antiemetic alone, and 9% received more than one agent first line. The antiemetic agent selected did not differ by patient age, parity, treatment for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, orthostatics, ketonuria, or disposition. We found no difference in time from medication administration to disposition between women who received ondansetron and those who received any other antiemetic (metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, or promethazine). Adjusting for potential confounders, compared to patients who received any other first-line therapy, patients who received ondansetron had 2.09 times the odds of having a time to disposition at or above the 75th percentile (95% CI 1.31–3.34).

### What are the costs associated with nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum? A systematic review [^117XRoWM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

- **Results**: The database search identified 648 citations. After removing duplicates, we screened the titles and abstracts of 316 articles, and 12 underwent detailed review. The exclusion of 306 studies was due to the broadness of the key search terms, such as 'morning sickness' or 'nausea in pregnancy', which led to studies focusing on mild illness without cost outcomes. Other reasons for exclusion included incorrect study types or failure to meet inclusion criteria.

- **Search results**: Five studies were excluded during full-text review for the reasons identified in Fig. 1, leaving a total of seven studies for data extraction. The summarised results of the included studies are in Table 1.

- **Study characteristics**: The included studies were published between 2001 and 2020, with reports on costs from high-income countries: USA (n = 3), UK (n = 3), and Canada (n = 1). There was substantial methodological heterogeneity across the studies in terms of design, source of cost data, periods for calculating costs, and perspective. Three studies employed a payer perspective, while four employed a societal perspective.

- **Quality appraisal**: The Larg and Moss evaluations checklist for cost of illness studies was applicable to five of the seven included papers. However, all studies assessed failed to fully capture every relevant aspect.

### Serotonin syndrome after treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy [^114tGFgv]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy often require pharmacotherapy for symptom management. Serotonin syndrome is a rare clinical entity that can be precipitated by the medications used to treat nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.

- **Case**: A 35-year-old pregnant individual with a history of hyperemesis gravidarum in an earlier pregnancy requiring prolonged hospitalization presented with nausea and vomiting at 7 weeks of gestation. She was incidentally found to have severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection when she was universally screened at the time of admission. She required pharmacotherapy, including prochlorperazine and ondansetron for treatment of nausea as well as sumatriptan for migraine. She developed acute spasticity, autonomic dysfunction, and temperature rise, precipitated by antiemetic therapy, consistent with serotonin syndrome. The syndrome resolved with supportive care and benzodiazepines.

- **Conclusion**: Serotonin syndrome is a serious clinical entity that can be provoked by the pharmacotherapy given to treat nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. This medical emergency requires early recognition and prompt management.

### Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy [^114L5ZH5]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Low credibility.

More than half of pregnant women suffer from nausea and vomiting. This typically begins by the fourth week and disappears by the sixteenth week of pregnancy. The cause of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is unknown but may be due to the rise in human chorionic gonadotrophin concentration. In 1 in 200 women, the condition progresses to hyperemesis gravidarum, which is characterized by prolonged and severe nausea and vomiting, dehydration, and weight loss.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatment for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy? What are the effects of treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2006. Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 22 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupressure, acupuncture, antihistamines, corticosteroids, corticotrophins, diazepam, dietary interventions other than ginger, domperidone, ginger, and met.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^1135ZsjY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Pregnancy**: Published epidemiological studies on the association between ondansetron use and major birth defects have reported inconsistent findings and have important methodological limitations that preclude conclusions about the safety of ondansetron use in pregnancy [see Data]. Available postmarketing data have not identified a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal outcomes. Reproductive studies in rats and rabbits did not show evidence of harm to the fetus when ondansetron was administered intravenously during organogenesis at approximately 3.6 and 2.9 times the maximum recommended human intravenous dose of 0.15 mg/kg given three times a day, based on body surface area (BSA), respectively [see Data].

	- The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, miscarriages, or other adverse outcomes.

### Pharmacogenetic predictors of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy severity and response to antiemetic therapy: A pilot study [^111zVHfT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) is a common condition. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between response to antiemetics in the treatment of NVP and genetic polymorphisms in the serotonin receptor subunit genes HTR3A and HTR3B.

- **Methods**: Pregnant women aged 18 years or older with NVP starting antiemetic therapy with promethazine, prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, or ondansetron at 16 weeks gestational age or less were eligible. The study recruited 29 women with complete data and sampling who returned for their one-week follow-up and were genotyped for HTR3A and HTR3B polymorphisms. Severity of NVP was captured using Pregnancy Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) and Quality of Life (QOL) tools upon enrollment and after one week of antiemetic therapy. These measures were correlated with pharmacogenetic variability.

- **Results**: Subjects with the genotype associated with high serotonin affinity of the 5-HT 3B receptor (rs1176744, CC) required more antiemetic medications (p < 0.001) than other subjects. Those with genotypes associated with increased expression of the 5-HT 3A receptor subunit (rs1062613, CT or TT) had worse final PUQE scores (p = 0.01) than other subjects, while rs3782025 variant carriers had significantly better initial (p = 0.02) and final (p = 0.02) PUQE scores than other subjects.

- **Conclusions**: HTR3B and HTR3A gene variants may contribute to variability in response to antiemetic therapy for NVP.

### Metoclopramide for nausea and vomiting prophylaxis during and after Caesarean delivery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114YuJTu]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting occur commonly during and after Caesarean delivery performed under neuraxial anaesthesia. Metoclopramide is a prokinetic agent reported to be safe in parturients. This meta-analysis assesses the efficacy of metoclopramide for prophylaxis against intra- and postoperative nausea and vomiting (IONV and PONV) in parturients undergoing Caesarean delivery under neuraxial anaesthesia.

We performed a literature search of MEDLINE (1966–2011), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE (1947–2011), Google Scholar, and CINAHL for randomized controlled trials which compared metoclopramide with placebo in women having Caesarean delivery under neuraxial anaesthesia. Eleven studies with 702 patients were included in the analysis.

- **Effectiveness**: Administration of metoclopramide (10 mg) resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of intraoperative nausea (ION) and intraoperative vomiting (IOV) when given before block placement [relative risk (RR) (95% confidence interval, 95% CI) = 0.27 (0.16, 0.45) and 0.14 (0.03, 0.56), respectively] or after delivery [RR (95% CI) = 0.38 (0.20, 0.75) and 0.34 (0.18, 0.66), respectively]. The incidence of early (0–3 or 0–4 h) postoperative nausea (PON) and postoperative vomiting (POV) [RR (95% CI) = 0.47 (0.26, 0.87) and 0.45 (0.21, 0.93), respectively] and overall (0–24 or 3–24 h) PON (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.52, 0.92) were also reduced with metoclopramide.

Extra-pyramidal side-effects were not reported in any patient. In conclusion, this review suggests that metoclopramide is effective and safe for IONV and PONV prophylaxis in this patient population. Given the quality of the studies and the infrequent use of neuraxial opioids, these results should be interpreted with caution.

### Treatment of nausea in pregnancy: A cross-sectional multinational web-based study of pregnant women and new mothers [^111CfjQZ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Antihistamines and metoclopramide were the most commonly used conventional medicines against nausea in the vast majority of the countries. The exceptions were the United States, Croatia, Russia, Serbia, and Slovenia, where ondansetron (USA) and antacids (Croatia, Russia, Serbia, and Slovenia) were the most commonly used medicines against nausea. This is in line with findings from a study on hyperemesis gravidarum treatments detecting inter-country variations in the frequency of different treatments, where serotonin inhibitors were most frequently used in the United States, antihistamines in Canada, while Australia had the highest reported use of promotility agents such as metoclopramide.

Meta-analyses and epidemiological studies have not found a higher risk of malformations with antihistamines and metoclopramide, and antihistamines are regarded as a first-line treatment according to guidelines in both North America and Europe. Recently, the safety of metoclopramide and ondansetron has been questioned. In July 2013, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended changing the use of metoclopramide to 10 mg three times a day for up to 5 days to reduce the risk of extrapyramidal side effects. As this is seldom long enough to treat nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP), the change will limit this medicine's usefulness for this population.

In 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) raised concerns over cardiovascular safety, suggesting that ondansetron could cause a prolonged QT interval, which can lead to Torsade de Pointes. Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring in patients with electrolyte abnormalities is therefore recommended.

Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) are common, affecting 50–80% of pregnancies. Often, these symptoms are mild, self-limiting, and resolve without intervention in the second trimester. However, in some cases, severe intractable vomiting can lead to dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, and significant weight loss, necessitating hospital admission. This condition is known as hyperemesis gravidarum (HG). HG is repeatedly associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, including low birth weight (LBW, < 2500 g: OR 1.42), small for gestational age (OR 1.28), and prematurity (OR 1.32). Furthermore, HG has a major impact on maternal well-being and quality of life and remains the largest single cause of hospital admission in early pregnancy. Despite its prevalence, the etiology of HG is poorly understood.

Approximately 0.8–2% of all pregnancies are complicated by HG. According to the latest Cochrane review on interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy, there are currently no treatments with proven efficacy available. Hospitalization may be required for intravenous treatment of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Presently, women suffering from HG do not receive any particular nutritional attention, although enteral tube feeding is occasionally used as a treatment of last resort. Enteral tube feeding effectively treats both dehydration and malnutrition in non-pregnant patients with poor intake and has been shown to be safer than parenteral nutrition during pregnancy. Moreover, several small studies in women with HG, which did not em…

### Evidence-based view of safety and effectiveness of pharmacologic therapy for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) [^111CKyjg]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Our goal was to review the safety and effectiveness of available antiemetics for treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

We performed a quantitative and qualitative overview of observational controlled studies for drug safety in pregnancy and randomized controlled trials for drug effectiveness for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. All of the following are safe and effective for treatment of varying degrees of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy: Bendectin/Diclectin (doxylamine, pyridoxine, dicyclomine), antihistamine (H(1)) blockers, and phenothiazines; however, the magnitude of effect, particularly for phenothiazines, is in question and may differ among individual agents. Pyridoxine and vitamin B(12) are safe and may be effective. Metoclopramide, droperidol, and ondansetron may be effective, but safety data are insufficient to recommend them as first-line agents. Corticosteroids may not be as beneficial as first thought, and there may be a small teratogenic risk. The relative effectiveness of various agents is largely unknown.

Many medications, particularly H(1)-antagonists and phenothiazines, are safe and effective for treatment of varying degrees of NVP.

### Gastrointestinal diseases during pregnancy: What does the gastroenterologist need to know [^1164cbRP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The approach to nausea and vomiting entails the exclusion of other causes, especially if these symptoms persist during the second and third trimesters. Most women do not require pharmacological treatment and can be managed with alternative options and dietary modifications. Diet recommendations include fractionized meals and avoidance of fatty foods and fresh vegetables that can delay gastric emptying. Daily consumption of 1.5 L of water or drinks containing glucose, salt, and potassium are recommended. Both thiamine (vitamin B1) and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) have proven their efficacy and are indicated as routine supplements in patients with protracted vomiting. A 2010 Cochrane review evaluated nine randomized trials involving ginger. Based on expert experience, ginger can be considered a non-pharmacologic option during pregnancy.

Concerning the pharmacological treatment, antiemetics can be an option for women with persistent nausea and vomiting. Histamine receptor blockers (anti-H1), such as promethazine, cyclizine, cinnarizine, doxylamine, and dimenhydrinate, are considered first-line treatment because no adverse fetal effects have been described. Doxylamine has the advantage of being safe when symptoms begin (6–7 weeks). In a cohort of 608,385 pregnancies, Pasternak et al. evaluated ondansetron, an H3 receptor blocker, and concluded that it was not associated with a significant increase in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, major birth defects, preterm delivery, or small born infants for gestational age. However, there are studies documenting congenital heart defects, especially concerning the pharmacological treatment.

### Ondansetron for treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and the risk of specific birth defects [^1154t3iE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to use data from two large studies of birth defects to describe time trends in ondansetron use for the treatment of first-trimester nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. The study also aimed to investigate associations, either previously reported or undescribed, between first-trimester ondansetron use and major birth defects.

- **Methods**: We used data from two case-control studies: the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (1997–2011) and the Slone Birth Defects Study (1997–2014). The prevalence of ondansetron use for the treatment of first-trimester nausea and vomiting of pregnancy among control patients was calculated in 2-year intervals. Using women with untreated first-trimester nausea and vomiting of pregnancy as the reference, we calculated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between first-trimester ondansetron use for treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and specific birth defects. A secondary exposure group of other prescription antiemetics was used to address confounding by indication.

- **Results**: In the National Birth Defects Prevention Study and Slone Birth Defects Study, respectively, 6,751 and 5,873 control mothers and 14,667 and 8,533 case mothers who reported first-trimester nausea and vomiting of pregnancy were included in the analysis. Among women in the control group, ondansetron exposure increased from less than 1% before 2000 to 13% in 2013–2014. Ondansetron use was not associated with an increased risk for most of the 51 defect groups analyzed. Modest increases in risk were observed for cleft palate (adjusted OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1–2.3).

### Treatment of nausea in pregnancy: A cross-sectional multinational web-based study of pregnant women and new mothers [^117TynE4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Variations were found across countries and regions in the prevalence of nausea, treatment rates, and types of treatment used against nausea during pregnancy. Cultural differences reflected in different treatment traditions, differences between countries with respect to the women's and general practitioners' willingness to treat, and variations in access to prenatal care and treatments and their relative costs may explain several of our findings. Among respondents suffering from nausea, less than one in three used any form of treatment, and only 18% had used any medicine against this complaint. We do not have data on the severity of nausea, and the respondents may generally suffer from mild symptoms that are sufficiently managed by non-pharmacological treatments, such as dietary changes. However, the low prevalence of treatment may also be explained by a reluctance of many general practitioners to treat these women, or by an overestimation of the risk of medicines among pregnant women with nausea. The overall prevalence of nausea (73.5%) in this study is in accordance with a recent meta-analysis of NVP including 59 studies from various countries.

Canada, followed by France, Switzerland, and Sweden, had the highest prevalence of conventional medicines use against nausea. This finding may be due to the clear and well-known guidelines in these countries and the antiemetic Diclectin®, which is approved for use against NVP. Therefore, simplifying the identification of safe and effective treatments may possibly increase the use of treatment.

### The outpatient management and special considerations of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy [^115X18nF]. Seminars in Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

With 50–90% of pregnant women experiencing nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP), the burden of illness can become quite significant if symptoms are under-treated and/or under-diagnosed, allowing for progression of the disease. The majority of these women will necessitate at least one visit with a provider to specifically address NVP. Up to 10% or greater will require pharmacotherapy after failure of conservative measures to adequately control symptoms. As a result, initiation of prompt and effective treatment in the outpatient setting is ideal.

Once NVP is diagnosed and treatment is started, it is crucial to track symptoms in order to assess for a decrease in or resolution of symptoms, as well as an escalation in symptoms requiring additional therapy. Of note, co-existing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Helicobacter pylori infection, and psychosocial factors may negatively impact the management of NVP. Ultimately, every woman has her own perception of disease severity and desire for treatment. It is critical that both the provider and patient be proactive in the diagnosis and management of NVP.

### Metoclopramide for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: A prospective multicenter international study [^114kRg5n]. American Journal of Perinatology (2002). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are very common during pregnancy, mainly throughout the first trimester. Metoclopramide is a dopamine receptor blocking drug that is commonly used to treat nausea and vomiting. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the effect on the fetus of intrauterine exposure to metoclopramide.

One hundred and seventy-five women who received metoclopramide and consulted six teratogen information centers in Israel, Italy, Brazil, and Canada were studied. Women exposed to metoclopramide were paired for age, smoking, and alcohol consumption habits with women exposed to nonteratogens.

Women in the metoclopramide group had a significantly higher rate of premature births (8.1%) as compared with the control group (2.4%) (p = 0.02, relative risk = 3.37, 95% confidence interval 1.12–10.12). Rates of major malformations in the metoclopramide group (4.4%) did not differ from controls (4.8%) (p = 0.84, relative risk = 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.34–2.45). According to our findings, metoclopramide use during the first trimester of pregnancy does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of malformations, spontaneous abortions, or decreased birth weight. However, larger studies are needed to confirm these observations.

### Treatment of nausea in pregnancy: A cross-sectional multinational web-based study of pregnant women and new mothers [^116y4LhQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) is one of the most common pregnancy-related complaints, affecting millions of pregnant women worldwide each year. Approximately 7 out of 10 women experience nausea during pregnancy and 50% experience both nausea and vomiting. For most patients, symptoms appear around the sixth week of pregnancy and gradually decline during the second trimester, peaking at 8–13 weeks. However, 10% of women will still experience symptoms after 20–22 weeks of pregnancy. The most severe form of NVP, hyperemesis gravidarum, is characterized by severe and persistent nausea and vomiting leading to weight loss, ketonuria, nutritional deficiencies, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. This condition often warrants hospitalization and affects about 1.1% of pregnant women.

NVP has been shown to greatly impact a woman's life, negatively affecting daily activities, relationships with partners, parenting, occupation, and social functioning. Feelings of isolation, fatigue, depression, and helplessness due to nausea have also been described. Nausea has been reported to be responsible for 33% of all sick leave during pregnancy. In the United States and Canada, NVP is a significant economic burden to women and society.

Because NVP is often most intense during the first trimester when organogenesis occurs, there is concern about teratogenic effects in treatment. This may lead to caution in prescribing and taking conventional medicines to treat this condition, despite the proven safety of use during pregnancy of many medicines.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 189 summary: Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^116yxJaJ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the use of ondansetron PO in pregnant patients for all trimesters, it should be used only if clearly needed. The ACOG and SOGC guidelines suggest ondansetron as adjunctive therapy for severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy when other antiemetic combinations have failed. The RCOG guidelines suggest reassuring pregnant women about the very small increase in the absolute risk of orofacial clefting with ondansetron use in the first trimester while also considering the risks of poorly managed hyperemesis gravidarum.

Ondansetron PO is classified under category B1 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus being observed. Studies in animals have not shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage.

### Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^113fPfJS]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy affects nearly 75% of pregnant women. The exact cause is unknown. In most cases, it is a mild, self-limited condition that can be controlled with conservative measures and has no adverse fetal sequelae. About 1% of women develop hyperemesis gravidarum, which may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and fetus. Patients with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy should be evaluated for other causes, particularly if symptoms are unremitting or presentation is atypical. Initial treatment is conservative and includes dietary changes, emotional support, and vitamin B6 supplementation. Several safe and effective pharmacologic therapies are available for women who do not improve with initial treatment. Women with hyperemesis gravidarum may require more aggressive interventions, including hospitalization, rehydration therapy, and parenteral nutrition.

### Ondansetron in pregnancy and risk of adverse fetal outcomes [^112wEXW2]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Ondansetron is frequently used to treat nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, but the safety of this drug for the fetus has not been well studied.

- **Methods**: We investigated the risk of adverse fetal outcomes associated with ondansetron administered during pregnancy. From a historical cohort of 608,385 pregnancies in Denmark, women who were exposed to ondansetron and those who were not exposed were included, in a 1:4 ratio, in propensity-score-matched analyses of spontaneous abortion (1,849 exposed women vs. 7,396 unexposed women), stillbirth (1,915 vs. 7,660), any major birth defect (1,233 vs. 4,932), preterm delivery (1,792 vs. 7,168), and birth of infants at low birth weight and small for gestational age (1,784 vs. 7,136). In addition, estimates were adjusted for hospitalization for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (as a proxy for severity) and the use of other antiemetics.

- **Results**: Receipt of ondansetron was not associated with a significantly increased risk of spontaneous abortion, which occurred in 1.1% of exposed women and 3.7% of unexposed women during gestational weeks 7 to 12 (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.27 to 0.91) and in 1.0% and 2.1%, respectively, during weeks 13 to 22 (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.29 to 1.21). Ondansetron also conferred no significantly increased risk of stillbirth (0.3% for exposed women and 0.4% for unexposed women; hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.10 to 1.73), any major birth defect (2.9% and 2.9%, respectively; prevalence odds ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.82), or preterm delivery (6.2% and 5.2%; prevalence odds ratio,…

### Complications in early pregnancy [^112jvSNK]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Low credibility.

During early pregnancy, women frequently experience nausea, vomiting, and vaginal bleeding. Nausea and vomiting can vary in severity and may be managed by dietary modifications and medications, or, in severe cases, may require intravenous fluids and additional medication. Care should be exercised when selecting medications for nausea to avoid any additional side effects or potential harm to the developing fetus.

When evaluating vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy, it is crucial to rule out ectopic pregnancy. If an intrauterine pregnancy is observed, the possibility of a threatened miscarriage should be considered, and appropriate counseling should be provided to the patient. In cases where neither intrauterine pregnancy nor ectopic pregnancy can be determined, a management algorithm for pregnancy of unknown location is presented.

### Getting through the day: A pilot qualitative study of U.S. women's experiences making decisions about anti-nausea medication during pregnancy [^116KF1Q8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

About 80% of pregnant women experience nausea and/or vomiting during pregnancy — over 3 million women each year in the U.S. These symptoms can profoundly affect women's lives, with consequences including decreased ability to function at work and at home, depression, concern for the health of the baby, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and significant economic burden. Many women consider taking medication for their symptoms; however, this decision is difficult because there is little evidence about the safety or effectiveness of most medications currently used to treat nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, as concluded by a recent Cochrane review.

Only one medication, Diclegis (doxylamine/pyridoxine), is currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. It is very expensive and often not covered by insurance. The most commonly used medication in the US, ondansetron, is not FDA-approved but is currently used by about one in four pregnant women. Its safety remains controversial. Few relevant randomized clinical trials have been conducted, and most were very small with very short follow-up periods. Thus, most of the evidence about these medications' safety currently comes from retrospective epidemiologic studies.

Two epidemiologic studies have suggested that ondansetron may increase the risk of birth defects. One study found a higher risk of cleft lip/palate, while another found a higher risk of heart defects. A third study found no association overall but lacked the power to examine individual birth defects.

The medical management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, particularly in relation to antiemetics, is guided by the SOGC 2016 guidelines. These guidelines recommend considering the use of H1 receptor antagonists (H1RAs) for patients experiencing acute or chronic symptoms of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.

### Ondansetron compared with doxylamine and pyridoxine for treatment of nausea in pregnancy: a randomized controlled trial [^1119gszu]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). High credibility.

The objective was to evaluate whether ondansetron or the combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine was superior for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.

- **Methods**: This was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial in which women with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy were assigned to either 4 mg of ondansetron plus a placebo tablet or 25 mg of pyridoxine plus 12.5 mg of doxylamine for 5 days. The primary outcome was an improvement in nausea as reported on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes included a reduction in vomiting on the VAS and the proportion of patients reporting sedation or constipation while using either study regimen.

- **Results**: Thirty-six women (18 in each group) were randomized to either ondansetron or pyridoxine and doxylamine; of these, 13 (72%) and 17 (94%) completed follow-up, respectively. There were no differences among the groups with regard to demographic characteristics or baseline nausea. Patients randomized to ondansetron were more likely to have an improvement in their baseline nausea as compared with those using pyridoxine and doxylamine over the course of 5 days of treatment (median VAS score decreased by 51 mm [interquartile range 37–64] compared with 20 mm [8–51]; p = 0.019). Furthermore, women using ondansetron reported less vomiting (median VAS decreased by 41 [interquartile range 17–57] compared with 17 [-4 to 38]; p = 0.049). There was no significant difference between the groups regarding sedation or constipation.

- **Conclusion**: Our investigation showed ondansetron to be superior to the combination of pyridoxine and doxylamine in the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.

### Supportive medication in cancer during pregnancy [^117D81ZM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

Antiemetics play a crucial role in managing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), a significant adverse effect of cancer treatment. The likelihood of experiencing CINV is directly related to the intrinsic emetogenicity of the chemotherapy agents used. Regimens are classified into four categories based on their emetic risk: high (> 90%), moderate (30–90%), low (10–30%), and minimal (< 10%). The timing of nausea and vomiting onset is also clinically important, as different drugs vary in their effectiveness against acute, delayed, or anticipatory emesis.

A specific set of antiemetic agents is used for patients undergoing chemotherapy, primarily 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (such as ondansetron and palonosetron), neurokinin (NK)-1 receptor antagonists (such as aprepitant and fosaprepitant), glucocorticoids, and olanzapine. Dopaminergic antagonists like prochlorperazine and metoclopramide, once common, are now largely reserved for rescue therapy due to their limited efficacy and adverse effects from dopaminergic blockade with prolonged use.

### Getting through the day: A pilot qualitative study of U.S. women's experiences making decisions about anti-nausea medication during pregnancy [^112sLqpz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

While participants were selected into our focus group because they had all filled a prescription for anti-nausea medication, their pathways to getting a prescription varied. Women who participated in our study described experiencing nausea during their first trimester, during which time prenatal visits with providers occur less frequently than later in pregnancy. We learned that decision-making about taking anti-nausea medication began before being given a prescription, as women made choices about scheduling early appointments to discuss nausea or ask for help in dealing with nausea.

Several women visited a provider in the first trimester for nausea and vomiting and were offered a prescription. Some requested a prescription due to the severity of their symptoms and/or recommendations from friends and family members. Providers often initially recommended non-prescription treatment options, such as over-the-counter vitamin B12 (pyridoxine), with or without doxylamine, and then provided a prescription for medication if the initial treatment approach did not provide relief, in keeping with clinical guidelines. The prescription medication women most often talked about using was ondansetron (brand name Zofran).

Focus Group 2, Participant 8: I asked my doctor [for the medication]. Back then, I was just worried all the time about how my baby was going to survive because I lost 15 pounds in a month.

### Resident obstetricians' awareness of the oral health component in management of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy [^1169TF9p]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are common in early pregnancy, typically occurring from the 4th to 7th week after the last menstrual cycle in 50–90% of pregnant women, and resolve in all but 10%. Many obstetricians encounter this problem and should be familiar with the probable outcomes and treatment options. Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy are usually self-limiting conditions. Women with uncomplicated nausea and vomiting of pregnancy have been noted to have improved pregnancy outcomes compared to those with complicated cases.

Improving the oral health of pregnant women prevents complications of dental diseases during pregnancy. Maternal oral diseases have been associated with pre-term births, the development of pre-eclampsia, and the delivery of a "small-for-gestational-age" infant, potentially leading to infant mortality and morbidity. Nausea and vomiting may cause a woman to avoid routine oral health practices, such as tooth brushing and flossing. This can lead to dental caries and gingivitis, the latter being the most common oral disease during pregnancy with a prevalence rate of 60–75%, and periodontitis, a bacterial infection detectable in up to 30% of pregnant women, has been linked with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as pre-term delivery and low birth weight among infants.

Food cravings induced by pregnancy may lead to frequent consumption of foods high in carbohydrates, increasing the risk of dental caries. Tooth erosion can result from nausea and vomiting of pregnancy due to the hydrochloric acid content.

### The management of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum (Green-top guideline no. 69) [^115MLMAv]. BJOG (2024). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, specifically with respect to severity assessment, the RCOG 2024 guidelines recommend considering the use of an objective and validated index of nausea and vomiting, such as the PUQE and HyperEmesis Level Prediction tools, to classify the severity of NVOP and HG.
