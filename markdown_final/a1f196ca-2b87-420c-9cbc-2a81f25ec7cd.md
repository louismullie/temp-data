## Question

are there clinical signs that help differentiate between pls and hsp?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there are clinical signs that help differentiate primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) from hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing the core upper motor neuron (UMN) syndrome and excluding common mimics. Then, I should evaluate age of onset and family history. Next, I will assess the distribution and symmetry of signs and look for discriminating red flags such as bulbar involvement and sensory findings. After that, I should apply consensus diagnostic exclusion criteria. Then, I will review ancillary tools including EMG, TMS, and MRI, followed by targeted genetic testing where appropriate. Finally, I will consider longitudinal evolution and conversion risk to synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm and conclusion [^112joKzD] [^114DafDc] [^114Yd24M].

> Let me first confirm the core clinical syndrome before drawing distinctions. Both PLS and HSP present as progressive spastic paraplegia driven by UMN dysfunction; I need to ensure there is spasticity, brisk reflexes, pathologic reflexes, and no clear alternative explanation such as compressive myelopathy, inflammatory demyelination, or metabolic causes like adrenomyeloneuropathy, because missing a mimic would derail the entire differential. Wait, let me verify that standard exclusions have been addressed with spinal imaging, appropriate laboratory workup, and, when indicated, CSF or serologies for inflammatory disorders, since MS and other inflammatory CNS diseases can masquerade as UMN syndromes early on [^112joKzD] [^115HEn6K] [^1159vog9].

> Next, I should review age at onset, because this is often a strong differentiator. PLS typically begins around age 50, most often in the 40s to 60s, and true childhood-onset PLS is highly atypical and should prompt a search for genetic etiologies instead; in contrast, HSP most commonly starts in childhood through early adulthood, though late-onset cases do occur, including into the seventh decade in some series. Hold on, I should verify that the child and juvenile-onset spastic syndromes with pure UMN signs are better classified within the HSP spectrum or juvenile PLS phenotypes tied to specific genes rather than adult-onset sporadic PLS, which reinforces the diagnostic weight of age in typical presentations [^112joKzD] [^114DafDc] [^114Yd24M].

> I will now examine family history and inheritance, since this frequently shifts pretest probabilities. PLS is classically sporadic, though a minority may harbor pleiotropic ALS- or HSP-related variants with debated phenotypic classification; HSP, by definition, is inherited and may be autosomal dominant, recessive, or X-linked, with de novo events creating apparently negative pedigrees. Wait, I should double-check that a convincingly positive family history of spastic paraparesis across generations strongly favors HSP, while a completely negative history supports PLS but does not exclude HSP given de novo or reduced penetrance scenarios [^114DafDc] [^111JDmzN] [^112WxnYF].

> Now, let me consider the distribution and symmetry of UMN signs because pattern recognition helps. PLS often starts in the lower limbs or bulbar region and may be asymmetric at onset, later generalizing to involve the upper limbs; a focal upper limb onset is very unusual for PLS, but bulbar-onset PLS with dysarthria and pseudobulbar affect is recognized. In contrast, pure HSP typically manifests with symmetric lower limb spasticity and weakness, minimal or no significant upper limb involvement beyond hyperreflexia, and absence of bulbar signs, where early corticobulbar features are incompatible with a pure HSP diagnosis and would push me toward PLS or complex HSP phenotypes. Hold on, I should verify asymmetry and bulbar involvement carefully in the timeline, as early arm weakness or bulbar signs weigh against pure HSP and favor PLS in an adult with sporadic disease [^112joKzD] [^114DafDc].

> I need to check for specific clinical red flags that tilt the scale. Corticobulbar signs such as dysarthria and pseudobulbar affect, along with emotional lability, strongly support PLS, while minor sensory abnormalities like impaired vibration and a neurogenic bladder are not uncommon in HSP and should raise suspicion for HSP when present. Wait, I should verify bladder findings with care; bladder instability can occur in both, but prominent early sensory symptoms are atypical for PLS and argue for HSP or another diagnosis, whereas a purely motor, symmetric leg syndrome evolving slowly over decades fits pure HSP better than PLS, which tends to generalize and may progress more noticeably over several years. I need to ensure I do not overinterpret isolated urinary symptoms without corroborative exam findings or imaging [^112joKzD] [^114DafDc].

> Next, I should review the formal diagnostic exclusion criteria, because premature anchoring is risky. The 2020 PLS consensus criteria require age at least 25 years, progressive UMN dysfunction for at least 2 years, UMN signs in at least two of three regions, and the absence of unexplained sensory symptoms, active lower motor neuron degeneration, or an alternative diagnosis by imaging or biofluid testing; EMG is needed to confirm the absence of active LMN degeneration and to separate PLS from UMN-predominant ALS. For HSP, a diagnosis of pure HSP is undermined by significant upper limb or bulbar involvement, which suggests complex HSP or an alternative diagnosis such as PLS, and therefore I must verify that the clinical picture matches the subtype before labeling it as pure HSP. Hold on, I should verify duration thresholds and region spread carefully, and I should not jump to conclusions before systematic EMG and imaging exclusions are complete [^112joKzD] [^116Z5UQr] [^114DafDc].

> Let me now consider ancillary tools that can sharpen the distinction, while remembering none are perfect. Transcranial magnetic stimulation typically shows cortical hyperexcitability and, in many PLS patients, cortical inexcitability, whereas cortical excitability tends to be preserved in genetically confirmed HSP; preserved excitability would therefore argue against PLS and favor HSP. Iron-sensitive MRI often shows marked hypointensity of the primary motor cortex in PLS and in UMN-predominant ALS, but this is much less frequent in HSP, making a normal or only mildly hypointense pattern more compatible with HSP; diffusion tensor imaging can reveal characteristic corticospinal tract and callosal changes in both conditions, but group-level patterns may differ. Hmm, wait a minute, I should correct myself: these modalities are supportive, not definitive, and must be interpreted in clinical context to avoid overdiagnosis based on a single imaging or neurophysiologic marker [^114vwT9S] [^114w2q3M] [^117Gja9y].

> I should confirm the role of genetic testing next, because it is pivotal when HSP is suspected. Pathogenic variants in SPAST, ATL1, SPG11 and many other HSP genes define the diagnosis and clarify pure versus complex phenotypes, whereas no single genetic marker defines sporadic adult-onset PLS, though pleiotropic ALS or HSP variants may occasionally be found in patients with a PLS phenotype, creating classification challenges. Hold on, I should verify testing strategy and pitfalls; next-generation sequencing increases yield but brings variants of uncertain significance, so careful phenotyping and segregation analysis remain essential to avoid misclassification, and a negative panel does not exclude HSP given incomplete knowledge of causative genes and detection limits [^114DafDc] [^111BSn1V] [^113k6an4] [^112WxnYF].

> I will now examine longitudinal course and the risk of conversion, since time is an important diagnostic tool here. PLS carries a nontrivial risk of later developing ALS in a subset, with conversion rates in longitudinal cohorts on the order of about 8–12% over extended follow-up, particularly among those with shorter symptom duration and steeper functional decline at inclusion; therefore, ongoing surveillance for new LMN signs and repeat EMG is prudent. By contrast, HSP does not convert to ALS, although complex HSP genotypes may accumulate additional features over time, so a stable pure lower-limb UMN phenotype over many years without LMN involvement and with supportive genetics reinforces HSP. Wait, let me verify that revisions from an initial UMN-limited leg syndrome to either PLS or HSP are common with follow-up, so diagnostic labels early in the disease course should be used cautiously and revisited systematically [^116DyoXZ] [^117HYdyS] [^114DafDc].

> Putting this together into a practical algorithm, I should first apply age and family history: onset before 25 years or a positive pedigree for spastic paraplegia leans strongly to HSP with genetic testing, whereas onset in the 40s to 60s, sporadic presentation, and early corticobulbar or asymmetric features favor PLS when consensus criteria and exclusions are met. If a patient in the typical PLS age range has a purely symmetric, leg-limited UMN syndrome without bulbar or significant arm signs, I should reconsider late-onset HSP and send HSP panels, particularly SPAST and ATL1 among others, while using TMS and iron-sensitive MRI to support the distinction when results are equivocal and committing to longitudinal EMG-based surveillance before finalizing the diagnosis. Hold on, I should verify that any atypical features, such as sensory loss or rapid progression, prompt a broader search for mimics and complex HSP, and that the 2020 PLS consensus framework guides the timing of "probable" versus "definite" labels to reduce diagnostic delay without sacrificing accuracy [^112joKzD] [^114vwT9S] [^114w2q3M] [^114DafDc].

> In conclusion, yes, multiple clinical signs and supportive tools differentiate PLS from HSP, with age of onset, pedigree, distribution and symmetry of UMN signs, presence of corticobulbar features, minor sensory findings, and ancillary testing via EMG, TMS, and iron-sensitive MRI serving as the most discriminative anchors; applying the 2020 PLS consensus criteria alongside targeted HSP genetics and longitudinal follow-up provides a validated pathway to diagnostic clarity while minimizing premature closure. I need to ensure each diagnosis is periodically reverified as new findings emerge, because phenotype evolution and improved genetic yields can legitimately reclassify cases over time [^112joKzD] [^114DafDc] [^114w2q3M] [^116DyoXZ].

Yes, clinical signs can help differentiate PLS from HSP, but **overlap is common** and diagnosis often requires longitudinal follow-up and ancillary testing [^112joKzD]. The most useful clinical distinctions are: **bulbar involvement** (dysarthria, dysphagia, pseudobulbar affect) [^112joKzD] and upper limb spasticity, which are typical of PLS and rare in HSP [^114DafDc]; **age of onset** is usually later in PLS (mean ~50 years) [^112joKzD] and earlier in HSP (childhood to early adulthood) [^114Yd24M]; and **family history** is common in HSP [^114Yd24M] and rare in PLS [^112joKzD]. HSP typically presents with **symmetrical lower limb spasticity**, mild sensory loss, and bladder symptoms [^114DafDc], while PLS shows **asymmetrical progression**, prominent spasticity, and minimal sensory involvement [^112joKzD]. Genetic testing [^113C8eAD] and MRI [^114w2q3M] can support the diagnosis, but clinical features remain central [^112joKzD].

## Clinical features differentiating PLS and HSP

### Age of onset and progression

PLS typically begins in adulthood, with a mean age of **~50 years** [^112joKzD] and slow progression over years to decades, whereas HSP usually begins earlier — often in **childhood or early adulthood** [^114Yd24M] — and progresses more slowly than PLS [^114DafDc].

---

### Distribution of motor involvement

PLS often begins with **lower-limb spasticity** and later involves the **upper limbs and bulbar function** (dysarthria, dysphagia, pseudobulbar affect) [^112joKzD], whereas HSP typically presents with predominantly **symmetrical lower-limb spasticity** [^114DafDc]; upper-limb and bulbar involvement are rare [^114Yd24M].

---

### Sensory involvement

PLS shows **minimal or no sensory findings** [^112joKzD], whereas HSP often has **mild sensory abnormalities** (e.g. reduced vibration sense) [^114DafDc].

---

### Bladder dysfunction

PLS commonly causes **bladder instability** (frequency, urgency, retention) [^112joKzD], whereas HSP is characterized by **bladder hyperactivity** with rare retention [^114DafDc].

---

### Family history

PLS is typically **sporadic** and rarely familial [^112joKzD], whereas HSP is often **familial** with autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance [^114Yd24M].

## Ancillary investigations

### Genetic testing

PLS has **no specific genetic markers** [^113C8eAD] and results are generally negative, whereas HSP frequently reveals **pathogenic variants** in HSP genes (e.g. SPAST, SPG7) [^114Yd24M] [^114DafDc].

---

### Neuroimaging

PLS may show focal "knife-edge" precentral gyrus atrophy [^115nXFXG], and iron-sensitive MRI demonstrates marked **primary motor cortex hypointensity** [^114w2q3M], whereas HSP may reveal a **thin corpus callosum** or mild cerebellar atrophy, with iron-sensitive MRI normal or only mildly hypointense [^114w2q3M].

---

### Neurophysiological studies

PLS commonly shows **cortical inexcitability on TMS** [^115nXFXG] [^114vwT9S], whereas HSP generally has **preserved cortical excitability** [^114vwT9S].

---

## Clinical red flags suggesting alternative diagnoses

- **Rapid progression or LMN signs** suggest ALS [^1159vog9].
- **Prominent sensory loss or ataxia** suggests complex HSP or other neurodegenerative disorders [^114DafDc].
- **Early cognitive impairment** suggests complex HSP or other neurodegenerative disorders [^114Yd24M].

---

## Conclusion

Clinical differentiation relies on age of onset, progression pattern, distribution of motor involvement, sensory findings, bladder dysfunction, and family history. Ancillary investigations — genetic testing, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological studies — can support the diagnosis, but **clinical features remain central** [^112joKzD].

### Primary lateral sclerosis: Consensus diagnostic criteria [^112joKzD]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

There have been consistent clinical observations reported across multiple case series in primary lateral sclerosis (PLS). The mean age at symptom onset is around 50 years, which is at least a decade earlier than non-familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and a decade later than hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). While there have been cases reported with symptoms beginning in childhood, many of those might now be linked to developmental or monogenetically mediated disorders. A male predominance has been consistently noted in PLS, with a range of 2–4:1.

An insidious onset is typical in PLS, which means that individuals are unlikely to reach specialized neurological services soon after the very earliest symptoms. For the majority of patients, symptoms emerge in the lower limbs first, but for a significant minority, they emerge in the corticobulbar pathways with dysarthria and often prominent emotionality, also known as pseudobulbar affect. Although dysphagia may become marked, the value of gastrostomy is far less clear than in ALS, and the need for non-invasive ventilation in PLS is more exceptional. Lower limb involvement in the early symptomatic phase may be articulated as a sense of disequilibrium or loss of fluidity in gait. Prominent sensory involvement should not be evident. Spasticity with pathological hyperreflexia are invariable examination findings. Although PLS typically generalizes to include the upper limbs, a focal upper limb onset to symptoms is very unusual in PLS.

- **Additional clinical features**: Bladder instability resulting in frequency and varying degrees of retention is a common accompaniment to PLS. The presence of wider brain involvement in PLS is increasingly recognized.

### Genetic and phenotypic characterization of complex hereditary spastic paraplegia [^114Yd24M]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

The hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a diverse group of neurodegenerative diseases with a prevalence of 2–7.4/100,000 in most populations. They can be inherited in autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked patterns with an age of onset varying from early childhood to 70 years of age. HSP was first classified by Harding in the early 1980s into pure or uncomplicated HSP, where lower limb spasticity occurs in isolation, frequently with bladder hyperactivity and mildly impaired sense of vibration, and complex HSP, characterized by prominent lower limb spasticity always accompanied by other neurological findings such as seizures, dementia, amyotrophy, ataxia, deafness, extrapyramidal disturbance, orthopedic abnormalities, and peripheral neuropathy.

Mutations in over 40 genes have been found to cause HSP. The most common cause of autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia is SPAST/SPG4 mutations, with patients presenting with a pure form of HSP.

In autosomal recessive complex HSP, the most frequent form seems to be associated with thinning of the corpus callosum, and it is mostly due to mutations in SPG11. It is also important to assess patients for rare causes of complex HSP, such as enzyme deficiencies, either biochemically or genetically. SPG11 is clinically characterized by slowly progressive spastic paraplegia and cognitive decline usually beginning before the second decade of life. Four less common distinct phenotypes have also been associated with SPG11 mutations, including Kjellin syndrome, which is a known manifestation.

### Diagnosis, investigation and management of hereditary spastic paraplegias in the era of next-generation sequencing [^114DafDc]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

The hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are traditionally subcategorized into "pure" and "complex" (or "complicated") subtypes. In northern European populations, pure forms are the most frequent. The clinical features of pure HSP have been thoroughly described in previous research articles and reviews, and diagnostic criteria have been proposed. Briefly, the typical clinical picture is of a slowly progressive, predominantly symmetrical, spastic paraplegia. This is frequently accompanied by minor sensory abnormalities, such as absent vibration sensation, and neurological bladder involvement, although bowel involvement is rare. Arm involvement, if present, is minimal and does not extend beyond hyper-reflexia and minor weakness, like difficulty unscrewing a tight bottle top. More significant arm involvement should raise the possibility of alternative diagnoses such as primary lateral sclerosis or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, while bulbar involvement is incompatible with a diagnosis of pure HSP. The age at onset varies from childhood to late adult life and is highly variable within many multiplex families. However, mutations in certain genes, notably spastic paraplegia gene (SPG) 3A/atlastin1, are predominantly associated with a childhood age at onset.

While pure HSPs present a relatively homogeneous clinical picture, complex HSPs are a disparate group of distinct disorders. Most complex HSPs are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, making them the commonest forms of HSP in populations where consanguinity is frequent.

### Cortical excitability changes distinguish the motor neuron disease phenotypes from hereditary spastic paraplegia [^114vwT9S]. European Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Cortical hyperexcitability has been identified as an important pathogenic mechanism in motor neuron disease (MND). Whether cortical hyperexcitability is a common process across the MND phenotypes, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), remains unresolved. The clinical distinction between PLS and 'mimic disorders' such as hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) can be challenging, potentially delaying diagnosis. Consequently, this study aimed to determine the nature and spectrum of cortical excitability changes across the MND phenotypes and to ascertain whether cortical dysfunction distinguishes PLS from HSP.

- **Methods**: Cortical excitability studies were conducted on a cohort of 14 PLS, 82 ALS, and 13 HSP patients with mutations in the spastin gene.

- **Results**: Cortical hyperexcitability, indicated by a reduction in short interval intracortical inhibition (PLS 0.26%, -3.8% to 1.4%; ALS -0.15%, -3.6% to 7.0%; P < 0.01) and a decrease in cortical silent period duration (CSP_PLS 172.2 ± 5.4 ms; CSP_ALS 178.1 ± 5.1 ms; P < 0.001), along with increased intracortical facilitation, was evident in ALS and PLS phenotypes, though more frequent in ALS. Inexcitability of the motor cortex was more common in PLS (PLS 71%, ALS 24%, P < 0.0001). Cortical excitability was preserved in HSP.

- **Conclusions**: Cortical dysfunction appears to be an intrinsic process across the MND phenotypes, with cortical inexcitability predominating in PLS and cortical hyperexcitability more prevalent in ALS.

### Iron-sensitive MR imaging of the primary motor cortex to differentiate hereditary spastic paraplegia from other motor neuron diseases [^114w2q3M]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of genetic neurodegenerative diseases characterized by upper motor neuron (UMN) impairment of the lower limbs. The differential diagnosis with primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) can be challenging. As microglial iron accumulation was reported in the primary motor cortex (PMC) of ALS cases, this study assessed the radiological appearance of the PMC in a cohort of HSP patients using iron-sensitive MR imaging and compared the PMC findings among HSP, PLS, and ALS patients.

- **Methods**: We included 3-T MRI scans of 23 HSP patients, 7 PLS patients with lower limb onset, 8 ALS patients with lower limb and prevalent UMN onset (UMN-ALS), and 84 ALS patients with any other clinical picture. The PMC was visually rated on 3D T2✱-weighted images as having normal signal intensity, mild hypointensity, or marked hypointensity. Differences in the frequency distribution of signal intensity among the diseases were investigated.

- **Results**: The marked hypointensity in the PMC was visible in 3/22 HSP patients (14%), 7/7 PLS patients (100%), 6/8 UMN-ALS patients (75%), and 35/84 ALS patients (42%). The frequency distribution of normal signal intensity, mild hypointensity, and marked hypointensity in HSP patients differed from that in PLS, UMN-ALS, and ALS patients (p < 0.01 in all cases).

- **Conclusions**: Iron-sensitive imaging of the PMC could provide useful information in the diagnostic work-up of adult patients with a lower limb onset UMN syndrome, as the cortical hypointensity often seen in PLS and ALS is less frequently observed in HSP.

### Spatacsin mutations cause autosomal recessive juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^113EeDwA]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

Autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia with thin corpus callosum is clinically characterized by the progressive spasticity of the lower limbs, thin corpus callosum, and cognitive impairment. White matter alterations may be part of the clinical phenotype. Disease onset presents itself during childhood and usually before the second decade of life. Mutations of the spatacsin gene on chromosome 15q15–21 (SPG11) represent the most common cause of autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia with thin corpus callosum.

Autosomal recessive juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ARJALS) is a rare disease that occurs before the age of 25 years. It is characterized by the spasticity of limb and facial muscles with distal amyotrophy of hands and feet. It follows a slowly progressive course, with cases of prolonged survival of more than three decades.

The overlap between hereditary spastic paraplegia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) prompted us to screen unrelated families with ARJALS for mutations in SPG11.

### Editorial comment: Iron-sensitive MR imaging of the primary motor cortex to differentiate hereditary spastic paraplegia from other motor neuron diseases [^1115D2K9]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

**Key points**: Conventional and advanced MR techniques may aid in the diagnosis of motor neuron disease. Iron-sensitive MR imaging of the primary motor cortex may reveal changes to help differentiate hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) from UMN predominant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (UMN-ALS) and primary lateral sclerosis (PLS). Additional research in this area is necessary.

### Primary lateral sclerosis: Consensus diagnostic criteria [^115nXFXG]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

A range of neuroimaging and neurophysiological tools have clear potential to quantify the UMN lesion and may help to refine the diagnostic pathway for PLS. Conversely, tools aimed at demonstrating subclinical LMN involvement, such as muscle ultrasound for the detection of fasciculation, may ultimately offer additional value for the earlier distinction from UMN-predominant ALS.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation studies have noted greater central motor conduction times in PLS compared with ALS, in addition to high-threshold measures for cortical stimulation, leading to the development of relative cortical inexcitability, a feature that reliably distinguishes PLS from HSP. Focus on beta-band EMG has considered intermuscular coherence as a potential distinguisher of PLS from ALS, and magnetoencephalography offers a broader analysis of differences in corticomuscular coherence.

Neurofilaments are an emerging biofluid biomarker reflecting the intensity of neuronal loss in a range of neurological disorders. Levels tend to be much lower in PLS compared with ALS, reflecting its much slower progression. Cerebrospinal fluid chitinases, thought to be macrophage-derived, may show a differential pattern of involvement in PLS compared with ALS, but further studies are needed to explore the key distinction of PLS from UMN-predominant ALS.

One of the features noted in some established cases of PLS is a focal 'knife edge' atrophy of the precentral gyrus, which is strikingly absent in even advanced cases of ALS. With the refinement of more automated volumetric MRI analysis, further studies are needed to understand its significance fully.

### Whole brain-based analysis of regional white matter tract alterations in rare motor neuron diseases by diffusion tensor imaging [^117Gja9y]. Human Brain Mapping (2010). Low credibility.

Different motor neuron disorders (MNDs) are primarily characterized by the clinical presentation, focusing on the predominance of upper or lower motor neuron impairment and the progression of the disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often functions as a tool to exclude other pathologies. However, novel approaches such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have begun to provide insights into the underlying pathophysiological processes of these disorders in vivo.

The present study was designed to investigate three different rare MNDs: primary lateral sclerosis (PLS, N = 25), hereditary spastic paraparesis (HSP, N = 24), and X-linked spinobulbar muscular atrophy (X-SBMA, N = 20), using whole-brain-based DTI analysis in comparison with matched controls.

This analysis of white matter (WM) impairment revealed widespread and characteristic patterns of alterations within the motor system, with a predominant deterioration of the corticospinal tract (CST) in HSP and PLS patients according to the clinical presentation, and to a lesser degree in patients with X-SBMA. Additionally, WM changes were observed in projections to the limbic system and within distinct areas of the corpus callosum (CC) in both HSP and PLS patients.

In summary, DTI was able to define a characteristic WM pathoanatomy in motor and extra-motor brain areas, such as the CC and the limbic projectional system, for different MNDs via whole brain-based FA assessment and quantitative fiber tracking. Future advanced MRI-based investigations might help to provide a fingerprint-identification of MNDs.

### Brain atrophy in pure and complicated hereditary spastic paraparesis: A quantitative 3D MRI study [^115wLBEv]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Hereditary spastic paraparesis (HSP) is a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive lower limb spasticity, categorized into pure (p-HSP) and complicated forms (c-HSP). The purpose of this study was to evaluate if brain volumes in HSP were altered compared with a control population. Brain volumes were determined in patients suffering from HSP, including both p-HSP (n = 21) and c-HSP (n = 12) types, and 30 age-matched healthy controls, using brain parenchymal fractions (BPF) calculated from 3D MRI data in an observer-independent procedure. Additionally, the tissue segments of grey and white matter were analyzed separately.

In HSP patients, BPFs were significantly reduced compared with controls both for the whole patient group (P < 0.001) and for both subgroups, indicating considerable brain atrophy. In contrast to controls, who showed a decline of brain volumes with age, this physiological phenomenon was less pronounced in HSP. Therefore, global brain parenchyma reduction, involving both grey and white matter, seems to be a feature in both subtypes of HSP. Atrophy was more pronounced in c-HSP, consistent with the more severe phenotype including extramotor involvement. Thus, global brain atrophy, detected by MRI-based brain volume quantification, is a biological marker in HSP subtypes.

### Primary lateral sclerosis: Implications for diagnostic criteria from a natural history study in the Netherlands [^111xfL12]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a rare disease characterized by upper motor neuron (UMN) degeneration. We aimed to elucidate the natural history in patients with UMN syndromes suggestive of PLS and validate the most recent diagnostic (consensus) criteria.

- **Methods**: A validation study of a long-term follow-up cohort was conducted, including adults with UMN syndromes and disease durations ≥ 6 months. Patients were assessed at baseline (T1), at 3 years (T2), and when possible, after 13 years (T3). Diagnostic categorization followed the 2020 PLS consensus criteria. Main outcomes included diagnostic classification at follow-up and survival.

- **Results**: The study comprised 86 patients (34 women [40%], mean age 58.9 ± 10.1 years), of whom 43 met the PLS consensus criteria at baseline (6 probable, 37 definite). Eight patients had a disease duration < 2 years, and 35 patients presented with UMN symptoms localized to one region (1 bulbar, 34 legs). Change of initial diagnosis occurred in 14% of patients with PLS, and 49% of patients presenting with UMN symptoms in one region progressed to PLS. Seven patients developed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and for 7 patients, diagnosis was revised to hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Survival was shorter for patients with a disease duration < 4 years. In the probable PLS group, 33% converted to ALS. Converters had a steeper Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale slope (p = 0.023) and shorter symptom duration (p < 0.001) at inclusion. Of patients presenting with leg symptoms, diagnosis was revised.

### Dragon score predicts functional outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients receiving both intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and endovascular therapy [^111pRqmB]. Surgical Neurology International (2017). High credibility.

The DRAGON score is a clinical calculator used to predict functional outcomes in stroke patients who have received tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment. The acronym DRAGON stands for: Dense cerebral artery sign or Dense middle cerebral artery sign (D), age (R), glucose level at baseline (G), onset to treatment time (O), and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (N).

This scoring system applies specifically to patients who have suffered an acute ischemic stroke and have been treated with intravenous tPA. The DRAGON score predicts the likelihood of a patient achieving a good outcome (defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0–2) at 3 months post-stroke, as well as the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the DRAGON score, but it should be noted that it is most applicable to patients who have received tPA treatment for acute ischemic stroke. It may not be as useful or accurate in predicting outcomes for patients with hemorrhagic stroke, those who did not receive tPA treatment, or those with other types of neurological conditions.

In predicting outcomes for patients treated with thrombolysis following a stroke, the DRAGON score takes several clinical factors into account, each contributing to an overall assessment. The assessment considers six key elements, including the presence of a hyperdense cerebral artery or early signs of infarction on computed tomography, where none of these factors would score 0 points.

### Symptom-driven lorazepam protocol for treatment of severe alcohol withdrawal delirium in the intensive care unit [^115PAW2U]. Pharmacotherapy (2007). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Modified Minnesota Detoxification Scale (mMINDS)" is used for alcohol withdrawal syndrome and alcohol use disorder. The Modified Minnesota Detoxification Scale (mMINDS) is a clinical assessment tool used to evaluate the severity of alcohol withdrawal in hospitalized patients. It includes both objective signs (such as tremor, sweating, and orientation) and subjective symptoms (such as hallucinations and anxiety), scored to guide management decisions. The mMINDS is adapted from the original MINDS tool to improve usability in medically ill populations and facilitate consistent monitoring. It is commonly used to determine the need for pharmacologic treatment and to monitor response during inpatient alcohol withdrawal management.

### Primary lateral sclerosis: Implications for diagnostic criteria from a natural history study in the Netherlands [^114hNYWY]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

All studies on PLS have the obvious limitation of being relatively small, which is inherent given that PLS is a rare disorder. As a result, the estimates of conversion rates to ALS have been variable and are likely inaccurate. Therefore, larger studies on conversion rates to ALS are clearly warranted, alongside more detailed analysis of which factors are associated or predictive of conversion. In this study, ALSFRS decline and symptom duration were the most important factors. However, additional factors, such as EMG changes and serum/CSF neurofilaments, should also be examined in future studies.

Both our study and the German validation study enrolled patients who initially did not meet the criteria but eventually did so during follow-up. The criteria do not provide guidance on how long patients should be followed, which could potentially cause the diagnosis of PLS to be missed in patients with slow spread of UMN signs to additional body regions. Conversely, there are patients with predominant UMN signs that remain restricted to the lower limbs for well over a decade and who do not meet PLS criteria. They have negative family histories and DNA testing for HSP, falling outside of a clear diagnostic category. These cases are perhaps best labeled according to their phenotype, spastic paraplegia.

In summary, this study provides long-term follow-up data (over 10 years) on a large cohort of patients with PLS. Using these data, we performed a validation study of the consensus criteria, which demonstrates several key points for potential improvement.

### Parkinsonism and motor neuron diseases: Twenty-seven patients with diverse overlap syndromes [^113WQLQy]. Movement Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

It has long been recognized that signs of motor neuron disease (MND) may accompany clinical evidence of parkinsonism in different neurodegenerative conditions. By using the Columbia University Division of Movement Disorders database, we reviewed data from 5,500 cases of parkinsonism and recorded the presence of upper motor neuron (UMN) dysfunction, lower motor neuron (LMN) dysfunction, or both. Among the 27 patients so identified, we counted those with autonomic dysfunction, cerebellar dysfunction, or dementia.

- **Patient classifications**: Among the 27 cases, seven had UMN signs and LMN signs as well as parkinsonism and were diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-parkinsonism (Brait-Fahn disease). Three of the seven had dementia that was not deemed to be frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Six other patients had no LMN signs but had UMN signs and parkinsonism and were classified as having primary lateral sclerosis (PLS)-parkinsonism. Four patients had both UMN and LMN signs with parkinsonism as well as the characteristic dementia of FTD; they were diagnosed with FTD-parkinsonism-ALS. Seven patients had MND, parkinsonism, and autonomic or cerebellar dysfunction, a combination compatible with multiple system atrophy (MSA). Three patients had syndromes compatible with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP).

In sum, we found that MND occurs in association with diverse parkinsonian syndromes; some are heritable, others sporadic, and causes are uncertain. Having MND may be a risk factor for parkinsonism. A prospective study may elucidate this possibility.

### New developments in imaging in ALS [^112pAjZC]. Journal of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Machine-learning and cluster analyses have dominated nearly all facets of ALS research in recent years, spanning from diagnostic categorization to prognostication. There is consensus among ALS neurologists that by the time patients meet diagnostic criteria, considerable degenerative changes have already taken place, hindering the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions. Diagnostic delay in ALS is well-documented, with the average interval between symptom onset and formal diagnosis ranging from 10 to 14 months. The specific factors contributing to diagnostic delay, the most common misdiagnoses, and the incidence of unnecessary interventions are also extensively researched.

The protracted diagnostic journey in ALS has considerable pragmatic ramifications, chiefly delayed entry into pharmaceutical trials. One of the roles of machine-learning applications in ALS is the early confirmation of a suspected diagnosis based on the recognition of disease-associated biomarker patterns. After a series of studies reporting good categorization accuracy in binary classification models, recent advances have been shown in multi-class classification. Most recently published studies speculate on the clinical utility of these models and how such models could potentially be developed into viable diagnostic, monitoring, and prognostic applications. Some propose concordance with pathological staging schemes, while others focus on prognostication. The long-term prospects of ML in ALS imaging are becoming increasingly clear.

### Primary lateral sclerosis: Consensus diagnostic criteria [^116Gm1TS]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a neurodegenerative disorder of the adult motor system, characterized by a slowly progressive upper motor neuron syndrome. The diagnosis is clinical and occurs after the exclusion of structural, neurodegenerative, and metabolic mimics. Differentiating PLS from upper motor neuron-predominant forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis remains a significant challenge in the early symptomatic phase of both disorders, with ongoing debate as to whether they form a clinical and histopathological continuum.

Diagnostic criteria for PLS may be a barrier to therapeutic development, requiring long delays between symptom onset and formal diagnosis. While new technologies sensitive to both upper and lower motor neuron involvement may ultimately resolve controversies in the diagnosis of PLS, we present updated consensus diagnostic criteria with the aim of reducing diagnostic delay, optimizing therapeutic trial design, and catalyzing the development of disease-modifying therapy.

### Genetic characterization of primary lateral sclerosis [^113C8eAD]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

Through the use of ancillary investigations, such as MRI scans and laboratory testing, several conditions with similar clinical presentations can be ruled out relatively straightforwardly, such as primary progressive multiple sclerosis and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). However, for other conditions in the differential diagnosis, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), this is more complex. The initial onset of ALS may be characterized by upper motor neuron (UMN) signs only, with lower motor neuron loss occurring later in the disease course. Therefore, follow-up over a number of years is frequently required to confidently establish the absence of lower motor neuron involvement, which is considered to be a defining feature of primary lateral sclerosis (PLS).

HSP is a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders characterized by slowly progressive spasticity of the legs (pure forms), or with additional features such as epilepsy, learning and developmental problems, and hearing loss (complex forms). In general, the onset of HSP is at a younger age than in PLS, ranging from childhood to early adulthood. Symptoms are symmetrical and limited to the lower extremities, progression is slower, and there is commonly a positive family history for the disease. However, asymptomatic UMN signs in the cervical region are frequently seen in HSP cases. Late-onset in the late fifties and early sixties has also been reported, as well as asymmetry. The mode of inheritance in HSP can also be recessive or X-linked, or the cause can be de novo mutations, therefore suggesting an apparently negative family history.

### Genetic characterization of primary lateral sclerosis [^112WxnYF]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

To provide better interpretation of variants of unknown significance, it remains crucial that they are reported in clinical and scientific reports. Only by doing so will evidence accumulate over time, allowing us to accurately interpret the clinical relevance of these variants. Likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants were found in 7% of our cohort. These findings raise the complicated question of how to diagnostically classify the cases carrying (pleiotropic) ALS and HSP/CMT variants. For example, in case 9, a NEFL variant was identified, which is associated with CMT and HSP. This specific patient had bulbar and upper extremity involvement and met the criteria for definite PLS, making the clinical phenotype more compatible with PLS than HSP, according to the treating physicians. According to the consensus criteria, genetic testing would not be warranted in this patient, while we believe that based on these genetic results, the phenotype should be considered HSP-plus rather than PLS.

The revised El Escorial criteria for ALS state that patients with progressive upper and/or lower motor neuron signs and a family history of a defined pathogenic ALS mutation meet the criteria for "clinically definite familial ALS – laboratory-supported". This means that only progressive upper motor neuron signs in combination with a mutation in an ALS gene suffices. Therefore, it would seem reasonable to diagnose patients with PLS phenotypes carrying ALS variants as atypical or slow forms of ALS.

The Turner criteria state that testing for HSP genes should only be considered…

### Primary lateral sclerosis: Implications for diagnostic criteria from a natural history study in the Netherlands [^116DyoXZ]. Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a rare disease characterized by upper motor neuron (UMN) degeneration. We aimed to elucidate the natural history in patients with UMN syndromes suggestive of PLS and validate the most recent diagnostic consensus criteria.

- **Methods**: A validation study of a long-term follow-up cohort was conducted, including adults with UMN syndromes and disease durations ≥ 6 months. Patients were assessed at baseline (T1), at 3 years (T2), and when possible after 13 years (T3). Diagnostic categorization followed the 2020 PLS consensus criteria. Main outcomes included diagnostic classification at follow-up and survival.

- **Results**: The study comprised 86 patients (34 women [40%], mean age 58.9 ± 10.1 years), of whom 43 met the PLS consensus criteria at baseline (6 probable, 37 definite). Eight patients had a disease duration < 2 years, and 35 patients presented with UMN symptoms localized to one region (1 bulbar, 34 legs). Change of initial diagnosis occurred in 14% of patients with PLS, and 49% of patients presenting with UMN symptoms in one region progressed to PLS. Seven patients developed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and for seven patients, diagnosis was revised to hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Survival was shorter for patients with a disease duration < 4 years. In the probable PLS group, 33% converted to ALS. Converters had a steeper Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale slope (p = 0.023) and shorter symptom duration (p < 0.001) at inclusion. Of patients presenting with leg symptoms, diagnosis was revised.

### ALS and MMN mimics in patients with BSCL2 mutations: The expanding clinical spectrum of SPG17 hereditary spastic paraplegia [^111XY1ZM]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Silver syndrome/SPG17 is a motor manifestation of mutations in the BSCL2 gene and usually presents as a complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). We present clinical data, follow-up, and genetic results of seven patients with Silver syndrome/SPG17, including a family with a variable intrafamilial phenotype ranging from subclinical signs to a severe and rapidly progressing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-like phenotype. For molecular diagnosis of the family, we used the TruSight Exome sequencing panel consisting of 2761 genes. We filtered for variants common to affected family members and for exclusive variants in the ALS-like index patient to find possible modifier mutations. We found that de novo mutations and/or incomplete penetrance in BSCL2 have been taken into account for Silver syndrome/SPG17 and confirm the large phenotypical heterogeneity of BSCL2 mutations. Our findings broaden the reported spectrum of the disease to an ALS-like and multifocal motor neuropathy phenotype and underline the need for further research into genetic modifiers due to the striking interindividual and intrafamilial variability.

### Primary lateral sclerosis: Consensus diagnostic criteria [^116t4W3W]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Developments in neuroimaging, neurophysiology, and molecular biology have not diminished the long-standing recognition of PLS as a distinct, clinically defined syndrome. Its rarity and prolonged survival trajectory have resulted in a degree of neglect in terms of therapeutic trials compared with ALS. Traditional reliance on EMG with overinterpretation of minimal markers of lower motor neuron involvement may contribute to significant diagnostic delay. The development of an international registry that includes all those with 'probable PLS' will allow a more precise delineation of the pathogenesis from ALS and accelerate therapeutic developments.

Beyond primary disease-modifying therapy, the most pressing unmet need for patients with PLS may well be the treatment of core symptoms rather than the extension of survival. The development of more effective relief of spasticity that does not sacrifice muscle strength would have a great impact for those living with PLS, notwithstanding the long-term desire for neuroprotective or regenerative therapy. Recognizing that advances in molecular phenotyping may well supersede purely clinical diagnostics, it is hoped that these pragmatic criteria will provide greater confidence to reduce diagnostic delay, thus allowing access to potentially disease-modifying therapies at lower levels of disability.

### Excluding pulmonary embolism at the bedside without diagnostic imaging: Management of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism presenting to the emergency department by using a simple clinical model and D-dimer [^117NwRCP]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). High credibility.

The Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism is a clinical prediction rule that stratifies patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) into different risk categories. It is used in the emergency department or outpatient setting to determine the likelihood of PE in patients presenting with symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or unexplained cough.

The Wells' Criteria includes factors such as clinical signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), an alternative diagnosis less likely than a PE, heart rate over 100 beats per minute, immobilization or surgery in the previous four weeks, previous history of DVT or PE, hemoptysis, and malignancy. The score helps clinicians decide whether to proceed with further diagnostic testing, such as D-dimer testing or computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). Patients are classified as having a low, moderate, or high probability of PE based on their total score.

The Wells' Criteria should not be used in patients with a clear alternative diagnosis or in patients who have been on full anticoagulation for more than 48 hours. It is also not applicable in pregnant patients or in patients under the age of 18.

The Wells' criteria for pulmonary embolism calculator assesses the likelihood of a pulmonary embolism based on seven input factors, each contributing a specific score. When summed, these factors categorize the risk level.

### An up-to-date approach to the management of seborrheic dermatitis [^115ziF8A]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis can present with various skin conditions and is associated with several factors. Symptoms include skin scaling, greasy skin patches, hypopigmentation, papules, and crusts. It may also affect the scalp, leading to plaques, erythema, and dandruff. In the eye region, blepharitis can occur.

The condition is linked with numerous health issues such as Down's syndrome, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury. It may also be seen in individuals with immunocompromising conditions or HIV infection. Additionally, seborrheic dermatitis is associated with lifestyle factors and medical treatments like infrequent hair shampooing and the use of 5-FU or solid organ transplantation.

Management and treatment considerations should take into account the wide range of symptoms and underlying conditions associated with seborrheic dermatitis.

The Graves' Orbitopathy Clinical Activity Score, commonly referred to as the CAS Score, is a clinical calculator used specifically in patients with Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid. This scoring system is particularly useful in assessing the activity of Graves' orbitopathy, a condition characterized by inflammation and swelling of the tissues around the eyes, leading to symptoms such as bulging eyes, double vision, and eye discomfort.

The CAS Score is used to quantify the severity of Graves' orbitopathy and monitor its progression over time. It is based on the evaluation of seven clinical signs: pain in primary gaze, pain with eye movement, redness of the eyelids, redness of the conjunctiva, swelling of the eyelids, swelling of the caruncle or plica, and swelling of the conjunctiva (chemosis). Each sign is scored as 0 (absent) or 1 (present), and the total score ranges from 0 to 7.

The CAS Score is not applicable to patients without Graves' disease or those without signs of orbitopathy. It also may not be suitable for patients with other eye conditions that could confound the assessment of the clinical signs used in the score.

The Graves' orbitopathy clinical activity score (CAS score) is a tool used to evaluate the activity level of Graves' orbitopathy (GO) by examining specific clinical features related to eye health. The tool focuses on seven distinct symptoms, each scored based on their presence or absence.

### Specific pattern of early white-matter changes in pure hereditary spastic paraplegia [^113Tz6xi]. Movement Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are genetically and clinically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders. Most MR studies on HSP include very heterogeneous samples of patients, and findings were inconsistent. Here, we examined six patients with pure HSP and SPG4 mutations by clinical evaluation, detailed neuropsychological testing, and neuroimaging analyses, including conventional MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and brain volumetry.

Differences in voxel-wise statistics and ROI-based analysis of DTI data between patients and 32 healthy volunteers were evaluated. Although conventional MRI and brain volumetry were normal, DTI revealed widespread disturbance of white matter (WM) integrity (P < 0.001), mainly affecting the corticospinal tract. With longer disease duration, frontal regions were also involved. The WM changes were also present in subclinical subjects harboring the pathogenic mutation. These subtle WM abnormalities have functional relevance because they correlated with clinical symptoms. Thus, early alterations of nerve fibers, which can be detected by DTI, might serve as a biological marker in HSP, particularly with respect to future longitudinal studies.

### Diagnosis, investigation and management of hereditary spastic paraplegias in the era of next-generation sequencing [^111BSn1V]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

The last decade has seen astonishing progress in the identification of HSP genes. Coupled with the introduction of high-throughput sequencing approaches, we are quickly moving towards the ideal situation where every HSP patient will have a defined molecular diagnosis if they choose to have it. This will provide significant immediate benefits to HSP families, including diagnostic certainty, prevention of unnecessary additional investigations, and accurate risk prediction for clinically unaffected family members. In the future, as HSP therapies emerge, it may also be a prerequisite for the personalized selection of appropriate treatment. In the meantime, it is important that supportive therapy, which can make a real difference to patients' lives, is not neglected.

### The HELLP syndrome: Clinical issues and management. A review [^112vCx2t]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

ITP is a clinical syndrome characterized by thrombocytopenia, which may manifest as a bleeding disorder with purpura and petechiae. Pregnancy does not increase the incidence of ITP nor exacerbate a preexisting disease. Even with a very low platelet count, there is, in most cases, neither maternal nor fetal morbidity or mortality.

HUS and TTP are thrombotic microangiopathies that share some pathophysiological characteristics with the HELLP syndrome, including endothelial injury, platelet aggregation, microthrombi, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. An abnormal blood smear, increased LDH, and creatinine levels may aid in differentiation. The microvascular injury in HUS primarily affects the kidneys. HUS typically develops in the postpartum period, presenting signs and symptoms of renal failure. However, most cases occur in children and adolescents, caused by a specific enterotoxin produced by Escherichia coli O157:H7. Rare forms may stem from a genetic abnormality in the complement system.

TTP, which is exceedingly rare during pregnancy, is characterized by neurological dysfunction, fever, abdominal pain, and bleeding. The spectrum of neurological abnormalities ranges from headache to visual disturbances, confusion, aphasia, transient paresis, weakness, and seizures. High levels of high-molecular-weight von Willebrand factor in maternal serum reflect the virtual absence of the metalloprotease ADAMTS13 enzyme, which is required to control the level of the factor. Specific tests for this hereditary condition are not readily available in routine clinical laboratories.

### Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: A clinical review [^1159vog9]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of ALS in patients with a typical disease presentation is relatively straightforward and is based on the recognition of signs of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) degeneration, with a progressively worsening spread of symptoms or signs within a region or to other regions (Fig. 2). However, in patients with very early disease presentations, slow disease progression, or concurrent central or peripheral nervous system disorders, the diagnosis can be challenging. The probability of misdiagnosis, the so-called 'ALS mimicking syndromes', is about 7%–8% [67]. ALS mimicking syndromes should be ruled out, as delay in treatment may have an unfavorable effect on outcomes.

For patients with predominant UMN or LMN involvement, the differential diagnosis becomes broader:

- **UMN involvement**: Cervical radiculomyelopathy, hereditary spastic paraplegia, adrenomyeloneuropathy, and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis should be considered.

- **LMN involvement**: The diagnosis of plexopathy, peripheral neuropathy (e.g. multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, infectious neuropathy) or myopathies (e.g. inclusion body myositis) should be ruled out.

- **Flail arm ALS**: This should be distinguished from mimics such as spinal muscular atrophy, Kennedy's disease, multifocal motor neuropathy, and monomelic amyotrophy.

- **Focal onset of neck extensor weakness**: Myasthenia gravis and focal myopathy should be considered.

Muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) is also a relevant factor in the diagnostic process.

### Mirena [^115K1etP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

- **Sexually transmitted infections**: Advise the patient that Mirena does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

- **Risk of ectopic pregnancy**: Advise the patient about the risks of ectopic pregnancy, including the potential loss of fertility. Teach her to recognize and promptly report any symptoms of ectopic pregnancy to her healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Risks of intrauterine pregnancy**: Advise the patient to contact her healthcare provider if she suspects pregnancy. Inform her about the risks associated with intrauterine pregnancy while using Mirena, including the risks of leaving Mirena in place or attempts at removal. If Mirena cannot be removed during pregnancy, advise the patient to report immediately any symptoms suggesting complications. Also, advise her about isolated reports of female fetal virilization following local exposure to LNG during pregnancy with an LNG IUS in place [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Special Populations (8.1)].

- **Sepsis**: Counsel the patient that severe infection or sepsis, including Group A streptococcal sepsis (GAS), can occur within the first few days after Mirena is inserted. Instruct her to contact a healthcare provider immediately if she experiences severe pain or fever shortly after Mirena insertion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Pelvic infection**: Advise the patient about the potential risk of pelvic infection.

### Diagnosis, investigation and management of hereditary spastic paraplegias in the era of next-generation sequencing [^113k6an4]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Although these developments are undeniably positive, there are pitfalls and caveats associated with next-generation sequencing approaches. Sequence variation is very common in the genome; for example, many millions of single nucleotide variants have been identified, with the vast majority of these sequence changes having a neutral effect with no clinical consequence. In addition, many of these sequence changes are individually rare. Thus, next-generation approaches typically detect numerous rare sequence variants. The more genes that are analyzed, the larger this problem becomes.

A major problem lies in deciding which, if any, of the detected sequence changes are pathogenic. In most cases, this can be resolved using bioinformatics and other approaches; for instance, identifying previously reported and validated mutations, excluding known rare population polymorphisms, determining the likely effect on the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein and how deleterious this effect is likely to be, and excluding mutations that do not co-segregate with disease. However, inevitably in some cases, a single conclusively pathogenic mutation cannot be identified, and one or more candidate pathogenic mutations remain.

This is a particular issue with mutations of the missense class, in which only a single amino acid of the encoded protein is altered, since it can be difficult to predict whether the resulting effect on the protein will have functional consequences. Such sequence changes are often reported as variants of uncertain significance.

### Evolving diagnostic criteria in primary lateral sclerosis: The clinical and radiological basis of "probable PLS" [^113Gmmy5]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Low credibility.

Primary lateral sclerosis is a rare neurodegenerative disorder of the upper motor neurons. Diagnostic criteria have changed considerably over the years, and the recent consensus criteria introduced 'probable PLS' for patients with a symptom duration of 2–4 years. The objective of this study is the systematic evaluation of clinical and neuroimaging characteristics in early PLS by studying a group of 'probable PLS patients' in comparison to a cohort of established PLS patients.

- **Methods**: In a prospective neuroimaging study, thirty-nine patients were stratified by the new consensus criteria into 'probable' (symptom duration 2–4 years) or 'definite' PLS (symptom duration > 4 years). Patients were evaluated with a standardized battery of clinical instruments (ALSFRS-r, Penn Upper Motor Neuron Score, the Modified Ashworth Spasticity Scale), whole genome sequencing, and underwent structural and diffusion MRI. The imaging profile of the two PLS cohorts were contrasted to a dataset of 100 healthy controls. All 'probable PLS' patients subsequently fulfilled criteria for 'definite' PLS on longitudinal follow-up and none transitioned to develop ALS.

- **Results**: PLS patients tested negative for known ALS- or HSP-associated mutations on whole genome sequencing. Despite their shorter symptom duration, 'probable PLS' patients already exhibited considerable functional disability, upper motor neuron disease burden, and the majority of them required walking aids for safe ambulation. Their ALSFRS-r, UMN, and Modified Ashworth Score means were 83%, 98%, and 85% of the 'definite' group, respectively.

### Dantrium [^112TjueY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2006). Low credibility.

Dantrium is indicated for controlling clinical spasticity resulting from upper motor neuron disorders such as spinal cord injury, stroke, cerebral palsy, or multiple sclerosis. It benefits patients whose functional rehabilitation has been hindered by spasticity, provided they have reversible spasticity where relief aids in restoring function. Dantrium is not indicated for skeletal muscle spasms due to rheumatic disorders.

If improvement occurs, it typically happens during dosage titration and is evident by reduced spasticity severity and resumed daily functions not achievable without Dantrium. Subtle but meaningful improvement may require input from the patient and those in constant contact. A brief withdrawal of Dantrium for 2 to 4 days can reveal spasticity exacerbation, confirming clinical improvement.

A long-term administration of Dantrium is justified if it significantly reduces painful and/or disabling spasticity such as clonus, or permits a notable reduction in the intensity and/or degree of nursing care required.

### Infantile ascending hereditary spastic paralysis (IAHSP): Clinical features in 11 families [^112kAkwa]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to report clinical, neuroradiologic, neurophysiologic, and genetic findings on 16 patients from 11 unrelated families displaying a remarkable uniform phenotype characterized by infantile ascending hereditary spastic paralysis (IAHSP).

Sixteen patients from 11 families, originating from North Africa and Europe, who presented with severe spastic paralysis and ascending progression were studied.

- **Results**: Spastic paraplegia started within the first 2 years of life in most patients and extended to the upper limbs by the end of the first decade. The disease progressed to tetraplegia, anarthria, dysphagia, and slow eye movements in the second decade. The clinical course showed a long survival and preservation of intellectual skills. Clinical, neuroradiologic, and neurophysiologic findings were consistent with a relatively selective early involvement of the corticospinal and corticobulbar pathways. No signs of lower motor neuron involvement were observed; motor evoked potentials demonstrated predominant involvement of the upper motor neurons. MRI was normal in young patients but showed brain cortical atrophy in the oldest patients, predominant in the motor areas, along with T2-weighted bilateral hyperintense signals in the posterior arm of the internal capsule. The ALS2 gene, recently found mutated in consanguineous Arabic families with either an ALS2 phenotype or a juvenile-onset primary lateral sclerosis, was analyzed. Alsin mutations were found in only 4 of the 10 families, whereas haplotype analysis excluded the ALS2 locus in one family.

In conclusion, the syndrome of IAHSP is ge

### Primary lateral sclerosis: Implications for diagnostic criteria from a natural history study in the Netherlands [^117HYdyS]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Progression to ALS

Of the 37 patients with D-PLS, 3 patients (8%) developed ALS. All these cases had limited atrophy of intrinsic hand muscles at inclusion but did not have more widespread LMN loss on clinical examination or EMG. Repeated needle-EMG studies, however, revealed findings fulfilling laboratory-supported ALS according to the rEEC at a disease duration of 6.7, 8.8, and 9.4 years, respectively.

Of the 6 patients with P-PLS, 2 (33%) developed ALS (cases 3 and 4) at a disease duration of 2.5 and 3.7 years, respectively. In case 3, there were clear clinical LMN signs with profound atrophy and weakness in the arms and legs. In case 4, follow-up needle-EMG studies showed findings in cervical and thoracic regions fulfilling the EEC.

In total, 5 of 43 patients with PLS (D-PLS or P-PLS) developed ALS (11.6%). Patients with PLS who developed ALS had a steeper ALSFRS slope (p = 0.023) and shorter symptom duration (p < 0.001) at inclusion. Age at symptom onset, sex, region of symptom onset, bulbar involvement at inclusion, and EMG abnormalities at inclusion did not differ significantly. C9orf72 repeat expansions were tested for 32 of the 86 patients; all were found to be wild type.

- **HSP**: In 34 patients, UMN involvement was restricted to the lower limbs at baseline. The updated DNA diagnostics yielded pathogenic variants in HSP genes in 5 of these patients. Pathogenic variants were identified in SPAST, HSPD1, SPG3A, CYP7B1, and SPG7. The variants in SPAST and SPG7 were not detected at inclusion but during the follow-up of this study because of improved diagnostics.

### Infantile-onset ascending hereditary spastic paralysis is associated with mutations in the ALSIN gene [^111V6J4M]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

We studied 15 patients from 10 families who presented with severe spastic paralysis with an infantile onset and ascending progression. Spastic paraplegia began during the first 2 years of life and extended to upper limbs within the next few years. During the first decade of life, the disease progressed to tetraplegia, anarthria, dysphagia, and slow eye movements. Overall, the disease was compatible with long survival.

Signs of lower motor-neuron involvement were never observed, whereas motor-evoked potentials and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a primitive, pure degeneration of the upper motor neurons. Genotyping and linkage analyses demonstrated that this infantile-onset ascending hereditary spastic paralysis (IAHSP) is allelic to the condition previously reported as juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis at the ALS2 locus on chromosome 2q33–35 (LOD score 6.66 at recombination fraction 0).

We analyzed ALS2, recently found mutated in consanguineous Arabic families presenting either an ALS2 phenotype or juvenile-onset primary lateral sclerosis (JPLS), as a candidate gene. In 4 of the 10 families, we found abnormalities: three deletions and one splice-site mutation. All the mutations lead to a truncated ALSIN protein. In one case, the mutation affected both the short and the long ALSIN transcript. In the six remaining families, the absence of cDNA ALS2 mutations suggests either mutations in regulatory ALS2 regions or genetic heterogeneity, as already reported in JPLS. ALSIN mutations are responsible for a primitive, retrograde degeneration of the upper motor neurons.

### Primary lateral sclerosis: Consensus diagnostic criteria [^1141dPha]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a neurodegenerative disorder of the adult motor system characterized by a slowly progressive upper motor neuron syndrome. The diagnosis is clinical and follows the exclusion of structural, neurodegenerative, and metabolic mimics. Differentiating PLS from upper motor neuron-predominant forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis remains a significant challenge in the early symptomatic phase of both disorders, with ongoing debate as to whether they form a clinical and histopathological continuum.

Diagnostic criteria for PLS may present barriers to therapeutic development due to the long delays required between symptom onset and formal diagnosis. While new technologies sensitive to both upper and lower motor neuron involvement may ultimately resolve controversies in the diagnosis of PLS, updated consensus diagnostic criteria are presented with the aim of reducing diagnostic delay, optimizing therapeutic trial design, and catalyzing the development of disease-modifying therapy.

### Betaseron [^112LmjpP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Seizures**: Seizures have been temporally associated with the use of beta interferons in clinical trials and postmarketing safety surveillance. It is unknown whether these events were related to a primary seizure disorder, the effects of multiple sclerosis alone, the use of beta interferons, other potential precipitants of seizures (e.g. fever), or some combination of these.

- **Drug-induced lupus erythematosus**: Cases of drug-induced lupus erythematosus have been reported with some interferon beta products, including Betaseron. Signs and symptoms of drug-induced lupus reported in Betaseron-treated patients have included rash, serositis, polyarthritis, nephritis, and Raynaud's phenomenon. Cases have occurred with positive serologic testing, including positive anti-nuclear and/or anti-double-stranded DNA antibody testing. If Betaseron-treated patients develop new signs and symptoms characteristic of this syndrome, Betaseron therapy should be stopped.

- **Monitoring for laboratory abnormalities**: In addition to those laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, complete blood and differential white blood cell counts, platelet counts, and blood chemistries, including liver function tests, are recommended at regular intervals (one, three, and six months) following the introduction of Betaseron therapy, and then periodically thereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms.

### Primary lateral sclerosis: Implications for diagnostic criteria from a natural history study in the Netherlands [^112LtH4Z]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Application of the adapted criteria would initially classify a lower percentage of the cohort as PLS (44% vs 50%). However, this would result in similar numbers after 3 years of follow-up (± 68%) and, importantly, a lower conversion rate to ALS (8% vs 12%). It is important to note that in the patients who converted to ALS under the adapted criteria, the diagnosis was based on needle-EMG findings, but not on clinically evident LMN signs. Moreover, all these patients had long survival (13–23 years since onset).

- **Diagnosis at each time point based on the adapted criteria**: The numbers represent the number of patients per category at each time point. T1 = baseline; T2 = 3 years of follow-up; T3 = approximately 13 years of follow-up. ALS = amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; HSP = hereditary spastic paraplegia; PLS = primary lateral sclerosis.

### Diagnosis of acute neuropathies [^113WN4yE]. Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Acute and subacute polyneuropathies present diagnostic challenges since many require prompt initiation of treatment to limit axonal degeneration. An exact and detailed diagnosis is a prerequisite for making the correct choice of treatment. It is crucial to determine whether the underlying pathological changes are due to demyelination or axonal degeneration. Electrodiagnostic tests can considerably contribute to securing an exact diagnosis in most cases.

- **Electrophysiological findings**: The specific and characteristic electrophysiological findings in the different types of acute and subacute neuropathies are discussed. Various electrophysiological pitfalls and technical problems encountered in these patients are mentioned.

### Reviewing the genetic causes of spastic-ataxias [^111Qcj15]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Although the combined presence of ataxia and pyramidal features presents a broad differential diagnosis, the presence of a true spastic-ataxia as the predominant clinical syndrome has a rather limited differential diagnosis. Autosomal recessive ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay, late-onset Friedreich ataxia, and hereditary spastic paraplegia type 7 are examples of genetic diseases characterized by a prominent spastic-ataxic syndrome as the clinical hallmark.

We review the various causes of spastic-ataxic syndromes, focusing on genetic disorders. We provide a clinical framework based on age at onset, mode of inheritance, and additional clinical features and neuroimaging signs, which could aid in the diagnostic workup.

### Ethosuximide [^114VQnDe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.

- **Absolute and relative risk**: The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions. However, the absolute risk differences were similar for epilepsy and psychiatric indications.

Anyone considering prescribing ethosuximide or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.

Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. They should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm.

### The various forms of hereditary motor neuron disorders and their historical descriptions [^112x7fxZ]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Motor neuron disorders comprise a clinically and pathologically heterogeneous group of neurological diseases characterized by the progressive degeneration of motor neurons, including both sporadic and hereditary diseases, affecting the upper motor neurons, lower motor neurons, or both. Hereditary motor neuron disorders themselves represent a vast and heterogeneous group, with numerous clinical and genetic overlaps that can be a source of error. This narrative review aims to provide an overview of the main types of inherited motor neuron disorders by recounting the stages in their historical descriptions.

For practical purposes, this review of the literature sets out their various clinical characteristics and updates the list of all the genes involved in the various forms of inherited motor neuron disorders, including spinal muscular atrophy, familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hereditary spastic paraplegia, distal hereditary motor neuropathies/neuronopathies, Kennedy's disease, riboflavin transporter deficiencies, VCPopathy, and the neurogenic scapuloperoneal syndrome.

### Hereditary spastic paraplegia: Clinical features and pathogenetic mechanisms [^112YoxFS]. The Lancet Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) describes a heterogeneous group of genetic neurodegenerative disorders in which the most severely affected neurons are those of the spinal cord. These disorders are characterized clinically by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs, and pathologically by retrograde axonal degeneration of the corticospinal tracts and posterior columns. In recent years, genetic studies have identified key cellular functions that are vital for the maintenance of axonal homeostasis in HSP. Here, we describe the clinical and diagnostic features of the various forms of HSP. We also discuss the genes that have been identified and the emerging pathogenic mechanisms.

### De novo variants cause complex symptoms in HSP-ATL1 (SPG3A) and uncover genotype-phenotype correlations [^113fFgZU]. Human Molecular Genetics (2023). High credibility.

Pathogenic variants in ATL1 are a known cause of autosomal-dominantly inherited hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP-ATL1, SPG3A) with a predominantly 'pure' HSP phenotype. Although a relatively large number of patients have been reported, no genotype-phenotype correlations have been established for specific ATL1 variants. Confronted with five children carrying de novo ATL1 variants showing early, complex, and severe symptoms, we systematically investigated the molecular and phenotypic spectrum of HSP-ATL1. Through a cross-sectional analysis of 537 published and novel cases, we delineate a distinct phenotype observed in patients with de novo variants.

Guided by this systematic phenotyping approach and structural modelling of disease-associated variants in atlastin-1, we demonstrate that this distinct phenotypic signature is also prevalent in a subgroup of patients with inherited ATL1 variants and is largely explained by variant localization within a three-dimensional mutational cluster. Establishing genotype-phenotype correlations, we find that symptoms that extend well beyond the typical pure HSP phenotype (i.e. neurodevelopmental abnormalities, upper limb spasticity, bulbar symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, and brain imaging abnormalities) are prevalent in patients with variants located within this mutational cluster.

### Genetic characterization of primary lateral sclerosis [^111JDmzN]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

Not all patients with a positive family history for MND or suspected for HSP/CMT in our cohort had a genetic variant identified. Despite the negative genetic findings in these cases, the family history is suggestive of a genetic cause of the disease. Indeed, it is not uncommon that in cases of HSP (also with a positive family history) the disease-causing gene is not found. Mereaux et al. performed genetic testing in a large cohort of HSP cases (1550), and pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were found in 23.9–54.2% of the familial cases (varying between inheritance) and 26.6% of the isolated cases. Between 5–15% of the ALS cases are familial, and in 60–80%, a disease-causing variant can be found, mostly C9orf72, SOD1, FUS, and TARDBP. Therefore, our knowledge of HSP and ALS genetics is incomplete. However, progress in genetic research is occurring at an ever-increasing pace, and it seems highly likely that additional novel HSP and ALS genes will be discovered over the next few years. It also seems highly likely that variants in these genes will also be identified in PLS cases.

The diagnostic yield of genetic testing for HSP and ALS genes in PLS is 7% based on our findings.

We believe that based on the results of Mitsumoto et al. and our cohort, genetic analyses could have a role in the diagnostic work-up of PLS and should not be limited to patients with only symmetrical involvement of the legs. Incorporating genetic testing in the work-up of patients with primary pyramidal disorders could lead to clarity regarding the underlying diagnosis for individual patients.

### Primary lateral sclerosis: Consensus diagnostic criteria [^116Z5UQr]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

A revised framework is proposed to facilitate the earlier diagnosis of primary lateral sclerosis (PLS). The choice of a minimum age of 25 years at the point of diagnosis ('probable' or 'definite' PLS) reflects a pragmatic decision to minimize the risk of highly atypical cases distorting outcomes in future therapeutic trials.

- **Consensus diagnostic criteria for primary lateral sclerosis (PLS)**:
	- The diagnosis of PLS requires:
	- The presence of:
		- Age ≥ 25 years
		- Symptoms of progressive upper motor neuron (UMN) dysfunction for at least 2 years
		- Signs of UMN dysfunction in at least two of three regions: lower extremity, upper extremity, bulbar
	- The absence of:
		- Sensory symptoms unexplained by a comorbid condition
		- Active lower motor neuron (LMN) degeneration
		- An alternative diagnosis: UMN pathology demonstrated on neuroimaging, or identified through biofluid testing that provides a plausible alternative explanation for the clinical syndrome.

### Inconsistent primary motor cortex glucose hypometabolism in primary lateral sclerosis [^113sQeg6]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a rare neurodegenerative bulbospinal upper motor neuron syndrome. Although most cases of clinical PLS have cortical ubiquitin and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology, the PLS phenotype may appear as part of the phenotypic spectrum in familial ALS pedigrees. However, PLS is no longer considered part of the ALS spectrum by the Gold Coast Criteria. The reasons for this exclusion are the lack of lower motor neuron signs and a significantly slower rate of progression when compared with classic ALS.

Mills' syndrome is a unilateral upper motor neuron disease, manifesting clinically in the form of slow progressive spastic hemiparesis; it is a rare variant of PLS. Despite upper motor neuron impairment being the defining characteristic of PLS, radiological evidence suggests that PLS patients may also exhibit widespread grey or white matter alterations beyond the cortical regions of motor control and the corticospinal tracts.

In contrast to classic ALS, diagnosing PLS is challenging, especially in the first two years of the disease, as it often requires diverse and targeted investigations. These investigations are necessary to exclude a multitude of other diseases (e.g. inflammatory central nervous system disorders, compressive myelopathy) and to distinguish it from mimics such as upper motor neuron-dominant ALS, hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Sensitive diagnostic biomarkers of PLS are still lacking, and further diagnostic tools would be valuable. PLS serves as a disease model for upper motor neuron degeneration, apparently beginning…

### Complex phenotype in an Italian family with a novel mutation in SPG3A [^111VywPy]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Mutations in the SPG3A gene represent a significant cause of autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia with early onset and pure phenotype. We describe an Italian family manifesting a complex phenotype, characterized by cerebellar involvement in the proband and an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-like syndrome in her father, in association with a new mutation in SPG3A. Our findings further widen the notion of clinical heterogeneity in SPG3A mutations.

### Tokyo guidelines 2018: Diagnostic criteria and severity grading of acute cholecystitis (with videos) [^111Dzo9D]. Journal of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Sciences (2018). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis" serves as a critical tool for identifying and classifying acute cholecystitis and gallstone disease.

The diagnostic criteria are designed to guide clinicians in diagnosing acute cholecystitis, a common and potentially serious gallbladder inflammation, and to stratify patients based on the severity of their symptoms. The criteria comprise local signs of inflammation, systemic signs of inflammation, and imaging findings. Local signs include Murphy's sign and right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness. Systemic signs consist of fever, elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated white blood cell count. Imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis are also considered.

- **Diagnosis of definite acute cholecystitis**: This is established if imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis are present, along with either Murphy's sign or right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness, and any one of the systemic signs of inflammation.

- **Suspected acute cholecystitis**: This is diagnosed if either Murphy's sign or right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness, and any one of the systemic signs of inflammation are present, but the characteristic imaging findings are not present.

If these criteria are not met, the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is not established. These diagnostic criteria provide a structured approach to the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, aiding in the clinical decision-making process.

### Diagnosis, investigation and management of hereditary spastic paraplegias in the era of next-generation sequencing [^1136zH3W]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

High-throughput sequencing approaches also may present ethical issues if so-called "incidental findings" (clinically relevant changes in genes unrelated to the condition being tested) are detected. These are particularly important when whole-exome or whole-genome approaches are taken, where, given sufficient numbers of tested subjects, it is inevitable that other potentially clinically significant abnormalities, e.g. mutations in cancer predisposing genes or detection of carrier status for autosomal recessive disease, will be detected. Whether and how such findings are reported back to patients requires careful consideration of their clinical validity and utility, and the ethical issues surrounding this are currently a topic of much debate.

Finally, while next-generation sequencing approaches have the potential to increase rates of molecular genetic diagnosis in HSP, they do not remove the need for careful phenotyping — this is still important, as it can help to focus bioinformatics analysis onto the most relevant genes. Careful phenotyping may also better define the clinical spectrum associated with pathogenic mutations in particular genes.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected multiple sclerosis: an updated consensus approach [^115HEn6K]. The Lancet Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of multiple sclerosis requires careful attention to its differential diagnosis; many disorders can mimic the clinical manifestations and paraclinical findings of this disease. A collaborative effort organized by the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in Multiple Sclerosis in 2008 provided diagnostic approaches to multiple sclerosis and identified clinical and paraclinical findings, often referred to as "red flags", suggestive of alternative diagnoses. Since then, knowledge of disorders in the differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis has expanded substantially. For example, central nervous system inflammatory disorders that present with syndromes overlapping with multiple sclerosis can increasingly be distinguished from multiple sclerosis with the aid of specific clinical, MRI, and laboratory findings; studies of people misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis have also provided insights into clinical presentations for which extra caution is warranted. Considering these data, an update to the recommended diagnostic approaches to common clinical presentations and key clinical and paraclinical red flags is warranted to inform the contemporary clinical evaluation of patients with suspected multiple sclerosis.

### European consensus-based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of immunoglobulin A vasculitis-the SHARE initiative [^1178h5DJ]. Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Henoch-Schönlein purpura, specifically in relation to corticosteroids, the SHARE initiative 2019 guidelines recommend initiating corticosteroids in patients with IgA vasculitis for the treatment of:

- **Orchitis**: This condition can result in significant discomfort and potential complications if not treated promptly.
- **Cerebral vasculitis**: Early intervention with corticosteroids can help mitigate neurological symptoms and prevent long-term damage.
- **Pulmonary hemorrhage**: This is a severe complication, and corticosteroids can play a critical role in its management.
- **Other severe organ- or life-threatening vasculitis manifestations**: Prompt initiation of corticosteroids is advised to manage and control these severe cases effectively.
