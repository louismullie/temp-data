## Question

Piperacillin-tazobactam for bullous pemphigoid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about using piperacillin–tazobactam to treat bullous pemphigoid. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what piperacillin–tazobactam is approved to treat and its pharmacology. Then, I should verify standard-of-care therapies for bullous pemphigoid and the quality of evidence. Next, I will examine whether there is any plausible mechanistic or clinical evidence for piperacillin–tazobactam in BP. After that, I need to check safety concerns including drug-induced blistering diseases and SCARs. I will then review PK/PD and feasibility for chronic autoimmune therapy. Finally, I will synthesize a clinical recommendation and explicitly note evidence gaps and caveats for BP patients who coincidentally need antibiotics for infections.

> Let me first confirm the drug entity and scope. Piperacillin–tazobactam is a beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination labeled as an antibacterial agent for polymicrobial infections such as intra-abdominal infection, skin and soft tissue infection, pneumonia, pelvic inflammatory disease, and complicated appendicitis, with efficacy linked to time above MIC rather than any immunomodulatory action [^113XTchg] [^115fD5qK].

> I should now verify the disease context and standard therapies. Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease driven by autoantibodies to BP180 and BP230; evidence-based first-line treatments are systemic or super-potent topical corticosteroids, with tetracyclines such as doxycycline serving as steroid-sparing options, and biologics like rituximab or dupilumab considered in refractory disease [^112YXU7X] [^116fx6WT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to review the highest-quality therapeutic evidence. The Cochrane review confirms steroids and doxycycline as key modalities, and the BLISTER trial showed initiating therapy with doxycycline achieved non-inferior short-term control with superior long-term safety compared with prednisolone, reinforcing tetracyclines as a reasonable initial strategy in many patients, especially the elderly who are prone to steroid toxicities [^112YXU7X] [^112VU29U] [^114SWcJV].

> Next, I will examine whether piperacillin–tazobactam has any mechanistic or clinical basis for BP. I need to ensure I am not imputing immunomodulatory effects to an antibacterial; Zosyn's mechanism is purely bactericidal cell-wall inhibition with pharmacodynamic driver of fT > MIC, and there are no data indicating anti-inflammatory or B-cell directed effects that would alter autoantibody production in BP, unlike tetracyclines that have recognized anti-inflammatory properties in skin disease [^115fD5qK] [^112YXU7X].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially considered whether robust tissue distribution into skin might imply some benefit; let me verify and correct that. Although piperacillin–tazobactam distributes widely with skin and soft tissue levels approximating plasma, that supports antimicrobial target-site exposure for infections and does not equate to an immunomodulatory mechanism relevant to BP pathogenesis, so I should not conflate penetration with autoimmune efficacy [^112Zicni].

> I will now assess safety signals pertinent to blistering and immune toxicity. I should double-check serious cutaneous adverse reactions and drug-induced bullous diseases. Labeling lists SJS/TEN, erythema multiforme, DRESS, and other severe hypersensitivity reactions, there is a reported case of piperacillin–tazobactam–induced linear IgA bullous dermatosis presenting as SJS/TEN overlap, and drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia has been repeatedly described with piperacillin–tazobactam, which can be life-threatening; moreover, penicillins are among drug classes implicated in triggering BP, which heightens concern in this population [^113H7wQz] [^116222rw] [^117NbkFB] [^116Rj9Ni] [^117H7kMb] [^112LUDeJ].

> Let me think about feasibility and PK/PD if someone proposed off-label use. The short half-life of both components necessitates frequent dosing or prolonged infusion, chronic use would require renal function-based dose adjustments, and monitoring for neurotoxicity and hematologic adverse effects, all of which make long-term autoimmune suppression impractical and potentially hazardous compared with established BP therapies [^112Zicni] [^111mFPvN] [^112SCeEe] [^113fhWyH].

> But wait, what if a BP patient has a coincident bacterial infection; I should clarify that distinction. Infections warrant appropriate antibiotics, and piperacillin–tazobactam remains a reasonable empiric option for select severe polymicrobial infections per infectious diseases practice, though stewardship and organism-specific guidance, including alternatives for resistant gram-negatives, should be followed rather than repurposing it for autoimmune control [^113T32Gc].

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm the clinical bottom line. There is no evidence that piperacillin–tazobactam treats bullous pemphigoid, no plausible immunomodulatory mechanism to support such use, and there are concrete safety concerns including SCARs and immune hemolysis; standard BP management should rely on corticosteroids, doxycycline-based strategies, and consider biologics for refractory disease under dermatology guidance, reserving piperacillin–tazobactam strictly for indicated infections with antimicrobial stewardship oversight [^112YXU7X] [^112VU29U] [^116FrYJz] [^111Ygvzh].

> Finally, I should review evidence gaps and explicitly state uncertainty. I need to check whether any RCTs, case series, or mechanistic studies support piperacillin–tazobactam for BP; none are identified here, representing a complete absence of therapeutic evidence and reinforcing that any off-label autoimmune use would be unsupported and potentially harmful given the safety profile [^112YXU7X].

Piperacillin-tazobactam is not indicated for bullous pemphigoid because it is an antibiotic [^115fD5qK] with no immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory activity. It is only used for confirmed or strongly suspected secondary bacterial infection in BP patients [^113XTchg]. Standard BP treatment is with topical or systemic corticosteroids [^112YXU7X], doxycycline [^114SWcJV], or immunosuppressive agents [^116fx6WT] [^115YddEr]; piperacillin-tazobactam should not be used as primary or adjunctive therapy for BP itself [^1143SsN2].

---

## Pharmacological properties of piperacillin-tazobactam

Piperacillin-tazobactam is a combination of a broad-spectrum penicillin and a β-lactamase inhibitor [^115fD5qK] used for severe polymicrobial infections, including skin and soft tissue infections, intra-abdominal infections, and hospital-acquired pneumonia [^113XTchg]. It has no immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory effects relevant to BP management [^115fD5qK].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding piperacillin-tazobactam in bullous pemphigoid

There is no evidence supporting piperacillin-tazobactam for BP [^116fx6WT]: it is not mentioned in BP treatment guidelines or reviews [^112YXU7X], and no trials or case series support its use for BP. Its role is limited to treating secondary bacterial infections in BP patients [^113T32Gc].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Piperacillin-tazobactam can cause hypersensitivity reactions, including rare severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) such as SJS/TEN and DRESS, which can mimic or worsen BP [^113H7wQz] [^117NbkFB]. It also carries risks of hematologic abnormalities, renal impairment, and gastrointestinal effects that may complicate BP management [^116222rw] [^116Rj9Ni].

---

## Comparison with standard treatments

Standard BP treatments include topical or systemic corticosteroids [^115YddEr], doxycycline [^112VU29U], and immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate, azathioprine, and rituximab [^111Ygvzh]. These therapies have demonstrated efficacy in controlling BP, whereas piperacillin-tazobactam has no evidence of efficacy in BP management [^112YXU7X].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines do not recommend piperacillin-tazobactam for BP; it is used only when there is a confirmed or strongly suspected secondary bacterial infection [^116fx6WT] [^113XTchg]. Its use should be guided by culture results and antibiotic susceptibility testing [^113T32Gc].

---

## Clinical scenarios for piperacillin-tazobactam use in BP patients

Piperacillin-tazobactam may be appropriate for BP patients with confirmed or strongly suspected secondary bacterial infections [^113XTchg], such as cellulitis, wound infections, or sepsis — especially when polymicrobial infection or resistant organisms are suspected [^116gYFKN] [^111coExF]. Its use should be guided by culture results and antibiotic susceptibility testing [^113T32Gc].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Piperacillin-tazobactam is not indicated for BP management [^116fx6WT]; it should be used only for confirmed or strongly suspected secondary bacterial infections in BP patients [^113XTchg]. Standard BP treatments include corticosteroids, doxycycline, and immunosuppressive agents [^112YXU7X]. Clinicians should be aware of the potential risks associated with piperacillin-tazobactam, including hypersensitivity reactions and SCARs, and use it cautiously in BP patients [^113H7wQz].

### Bullous pemphigoid: A practical approach to diagnosis and management in the modern era [^116fx6WT]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common autoimmune subepidermal blistering disorder, primarily presenting with tense bullae and severe pruritus. Diagnosing and treating BP can be challenging due to its variable clinical presentations. This article provides a comprehensive overview of BP's clinical features, diagnostic approaches, and emerging therapeutic options.

- **Diagnostic basics**: We will briefly discuss these phenotypes, highlight diagnostic basics, and summarize recent laboratory advancements that have improved diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy.

- **Emerging therapeutic options**: The treatment landscape for BP has evolved significantly. Newer therapies, including biologics such as rituximab, omalizumab, dupilumab, and Janus kinase inhibitors, target the immunopathogenesis of BP. These treatments can reduce the adverse effects associated with cumulative corticosteroid exposure and conventional immunosuppressants.

The article emphasizes personalized medicine and improved patient outcomes.

### Interventions for bullous pemphigoid [^112YXU7X]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common autoimmune blistering disease. Oral steroids are the standard treatment. We have updated this review, which was first published in 2002, because several new treatments have since been tried.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of treatments for bullous pemphigoid.

- **Search methods**: We updated searches of the following databases to November 2021: Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. We searched five trial databases to January 2022 and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

- **Selection criteria**: RCTs of treatments for immunofluorescence-confirmed bullous pemphigoid.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors, working independently, evaluated the studies against the review's inclusion criteria and extracted data from included studies. Using GRADE methodology, we assessed the certainty of the evidence for each outcome in each comparison. Our primary outcomes were the healing of skin lesions and mortality.

- **Main results**: We identified 14 RCTs (1,442 participants). The main treatment modalities assessed were oral steroids, topical steroids, and the oral anti-inflammatory antibiotic doxycycline. Most studies reported mortality, but adverse events and quality of life were not well-reported. We decided to look at the primary outcomes 'disease control' and 'mortality'. Almost all studies investigated different comparisons; two studies were placebo-controlled. The results are therefore based on a single study for each comparison.

### Doxycycline versus prednisolone as an initial treatment strategy for bullous pemphigoid: a pragmatic, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^114SWcJV]. Lancet (2017). High credibility.

We included two primary outcomes to measure the trade-off between effectiveness (initial blister control) and safety (serious adverse effects) for the two treatment strategies. Short-term control (effectiveness) was measured at 6 weeks after randomisation, and long-term safety was assessed at 52 weeks after randomisation. The primary outcomes were defined as the absolute difference between the treatment groups in: the proportion of participants classed as treatment success (three or fewer significant blisters) at 6 weeks, regardless of whether their treatment had been modified because of a poor response, and the proportion of participants with grade 3–5 (severe, life-threatening, or fatal) adverse events that were possibly, probably, or definitely related to the treatment in the 52 weeks following randomisation. A non-inferiority effectiveness comparison of treatment strategy was performed, along with a superiority safety comparison. A modified version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0) was used.

Secondary effectiveness outcomes included the proportion of participants who were deemed treatment successes (three or fewer significant blisters and no treatment modification before 6 weeks as a more direct comparison of drug rather than treatment strategy), the proportion classed as treatment success at 13 and 52 weeks (three or fewer significant blisters and no treatment modification), and relapses (those with further episodes of bullous pemphigoid during the study who had previously been classed as success). Secondary safety outcomes were the proportion reporting related adverse events.

### Pulmonary penetration of piperacillin and tazobactam in critically ill patients [^113C7WkV]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Pulmonary infections in critically ill patients are common and associated with high morbidity and mortality. Piperacillin-tazobactam is frequently used in therapy for these patients. Antibiotic concentrations in the lung reflect target-site antibiotic concentrations in patients with pneumonia. The aim of this study was to assess the plasma and intrapulmonary pharmacokinetics (PK) of piperacillin-tazobactam in critically ill patients administered standard regimens. A population PK model was developed to describe plasma and intrapulmonary piperacillin and tazobactam concentrations. The probability of piperacillin exposures reaching pharmacodynamic endpoints and the impact of pulmonary permeability on piperacillin and tazobactam pulmonary penetration was explored. The median piperacillin and tazobactam pulmonary penetration ratios were 49.3% and 121.2%, respectively. Pulmonary concentrations of both were unpredictable and negatively correlated with pulmonary permeability. Thus, piperacillin-tazobactam regimens may be insufficient to treat pneumonia caused by susceptible organisms in some critically ill patients.

### Zosyn [^111mFPvN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Specific populations**:
	- **Renal impairment**: After the administration of single doses of piperacillin and tazobactam to subjects with renal impairment, the half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam increases with decreasing creatinine clearance. At creatinine clearance below 20 mL/min, the increase in half-life is twofold for piperacillin and fourfold for tazobactam compared to subjects with normal renal function. Dosage adjustments for Zosyn are recommended when creatinine clearance is below 40 mL/min in patients receiving the usual recommended daily dose of Zosyn. See Dosage and Administration (2) for specific recommendations for the treatment of patients with renal impairment.

	- **Dialysis**: Hemodialysis removes 30% to 40% of a piperacillin and tazobactam dose, with an additional 5% of the tazobactam dose removed as the tazobactam metabolite. Peritoneal dialysis removes approximately 6% and 21% of the piperacillin and tazobactam doses, respectively, with up to 16% of the tazobactam dose removed as the tazobactam metabolite. For dosage recommendations for patients undergoing hemodialysis, see Dosage and Administration (2).

- **Hepatic impairment**: The half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam increases by approximately 25% and 18%, respectively, in patients with hepatic cirrhosis compared to healthy subjects. However, this difference does not warrant dosage adjustment of Zosyn due to hepatic cirrhosis.

### Zosyn [^115m1SU6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Piperacillin and tazobactam pharmacokinetics were studied in pediatric patients 2 months of age and older. The clearance of both compounds is slower in the younger patients compared to older children and adults.

In a population PK analysis, estimated clearance for 9-month-old to 12-year-old patients was comparable to adults, with a population mean (SE) value of 5.64 (0.34) mL/min/kg. The piperacillin clearance estimate is 80% of this value for pediatric patients 2–9 months old. In patients younger than 2 months of age, clearance of piperacillin is slower compared to older children; however, it is not adequately characterized for dosing recommendations. The population mean (SE) for piperacillin volume of distribution is 0.243 (0.011) L/kg and is independent of age.

- **Geriatrics**: The impact of age on the pharmacokinetics of piperacillin and tazobactam was evaluated in healthy male subjects, aged 18–35 years (n = 6) and aged 65–80 years (n = 12). Mean half‑life for piperacillin and tazobactam was 32% and 55% higher, respectively, in the elderly compared to the younger subjects. This difference may be due to age-related changes in creatinine clearance.

- **Race**: The effect of race on piperacillin and tazobactam was evaluated in healthy male volunteers. No difference in piperacillin or tazobactam pharmacokinetics was observed between Asian (n = 9) and Caucasian (n = 9) healthy volunteers who received single 4/0.5 g doses.

- **Drug interactions**: The potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions between Zosyn and aminoglycosides, probenecid, vancomycin, heparin, and vecuronium was considered.

### Zosyn [^112Zicni]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Both piperacillin and tazobactam are approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. The protein binding of either piperacillin or tazobactam is unaffected by the presence of the other compound. The protein binding of the tazobactam metabolite is negligible.

Piperacillin and tazobactam are widely distributed into tissues and body fluids, including intestinal mucosa, gallbladder, lung, female reproductive tissues (uterus, ovary, and fallopian tube), interstitial fluid, and bile. Mean tissue concentrations are generally 50% to 100% of those in plasma. Distribution of piperacillin and tazobactam into cerebrospinal fluid is low in subjects with non-inflamed meninges, as with other penicillins (see Table 8).

- **Metabolism**: Piperacillin is metabolized to a minor microbiologically active desethyl metabolite. Tazobactam is metabolized to a single metabolite that lacks pharmacological and antibacterial activities.

- **Excretion**: Following single or multiple Zosyn doses to healthy subjects, the plasma half-life of piperacillin and tazobactam ranged from 0.7 to 1.2 hours and was unaffected by dose or duration of infusion. Both piperacillin and tazobactam are eliminated via the kidney by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Piperacillin is excreted rapidly as unchanged drug with 68% of the administered dose excreted in the urine. Tazobactam and its metabolite are eliminated primarily by renal excretion, with 80% of the administered dose excreted as unchanged drug and the remainder as the single metabolite. Piperacillin, tazobactam, and desethyl piperacillin are also secreted.

### Doxycycline versus prednisolone as an initial treatment strategy for bullous pemphigoid: a pragmatic, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^112VU29U]. Lancet (2017). High credibility.

We have shown that starting treatment for bullous pemphigoid with doxycycline 200 mg daily produces acceptable short-term effectiveness within our predefined non-inferiority margin, and offers significant safety gains at one year compared with initiating treatment with prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg per day. Although we did not find clear evidence that differences between the two treatment strategies varied by baseline disease severity, our study suggests that effectiveness of either strategy is modest for those with severe disease.

Previous studies have shown good blister control and better safety for prolonged use of super-potent topical corticosteroids over the whole body when compared with high-dose oral prednisolone. However, such a regimen might be impractical for some patients and carers. Prolonged topical corticosteroid use also causes adverse effects like skin thinning and those associated with systemic absorption. Most guidelines still recommend oral prednisolone (between 0.5 mg/kg per day and 1.5 mg/kg per day according to initial severity). While most guidelines mention the widespread use of tetracyclines in bullous pemphigoid, they also cite the lack of high-quality evidence to support this treatment recommendation. The Cochrane review of bullous pemphigoid found only one randomised study of 18 patients treated with tetracycline and nicotinamide versus prednisolone, which had inconclusive results. None have been published since. The BLISTER study fills this gap.

### In vitro and in vivo activities of piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem at different inoculum sizes of ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae [^112D1jmw]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

The inoculum effect is a laboratory phenomenon where the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an antibiotic increases when a large number of organisms are exposed. Given the emergence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-Kpn) infections, the inoculum effect of ESBL-Kpn on β-lactams was studied both in vitro and in vivo using an experimental model of pneumonia.

The in vitro inoculum effect of 45 clinical ESBL-Kpn isolates on β-lactams was evaluated at standard (10⁵ CFU/mL) and high (10⁷ CFU/mL) organism concentrations. The MIC50 of piperacillin-tazobactam, cefotaxime, and cefepime increased eight-fold or more, while that of meropenem increased two-fold.

- **In vivo effect**: This was evaluated in an ESBL-Kpn pneumonia mouse model treated with doses of piperacillin-tazobactam (1000 mg/kg four times daily, %T > MIC; 32.60%) or meropenem (100 mg/kg twice daily, %T > MIC; 28.65%) at low/standard (10⁴ CFU/mouse) and high (10⁶ CFU/mouse) inocula. In mice administered a low inoculum, no deaths occurred after treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem, whereas all control mice died. In the high inoculum model, all mice in the piperacillin-tazobactam-treated group died, while all meropenem-treated mice survived, demonstrating a decreased bacterial load in the lungs and no invasion into the blood.

In conclusion, meropenem was more resistant to the inoculum effect of ESBL-Kpn than piperacillin-tazobactam in both in vitro and in vivo settings. This suggests that in managing severe pneumonia caused by ESBL-Kpn, caruse.

### Tazicef [^114Advi8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Ceftazidime is generally well-tolerated, with a low incidence of adverse reactions reported in clinical trials. The most common reactions were local reactions following intravenous injection, along with allergic and gastrointestinal reactions. Other adverse reactions were encountered infrequently, and no disulfiram-like reactions were reported.

The following adverse effects from clinical trials were considered to be either related to ceftazidime therapy or of uncertain etiology:

- **Local effects**: Reported in fewer than 2% of patients, these included phlebitis and inflammation at the site of injection (1 in 69 patients).

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Reported in 2% of patients, they included pruritus, rash, and fever. Immediate reactions, generally manifested by rash and/or pruritus, occurred in 1 in 285 patients. Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and erythema multiforme have also been reported with cephalosporin antibacterial drugs, including ceftazidime. Angioedema and anaphylaxis (bronchospasm and/or hypotension) have been reported very rarely.

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Reported in fewer than 2% of patients, they included diarrhea (1 in 78), nausea (1 in 156), vomiting (1 in 500), and abdominal pain (1 in 416). The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after treatment.

### Bullous pemphigoid secondary to pembrolizumab mimicking toxic epidermal necrolysis [^111hnpst]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Similar to other cases of BP secondary to pembrolizumab, our patient was successfully treated with systemic steroids. Because of the unpredictable timeline of the development of BP secondary to pembrolizumab, it is important to monitor for cutaneous symptoms while a patient is receiving the drug. It is also important to understand the course of clinical presentation of pembrolizumab-induced BP and that widespread bullae development can lead to confluent denuded patches, mimicking TEN.

Although much remains to be discovered about the adverse effects of anti–PD-1 drugs, the number of reported cases of these medications precipitating SJS/TEN in patients is similar in number to reports of BP. Because of stark differences in the prognosis of BP and SJS/TEN, early differentiation of BP from SJS/TEN could lead to a drastic improvement in patient outcomes. In the context of pembrolizumab-induced BP, the most helpful distinguishing features are serology/histopathology, the presence of pruritus, the absence of fever, and chronicity, especially in relation to pembrolizumab treatment initiation.

### Effect of therapeutic drug monitoring-based dose optimization of piperacillin/tazobactam on sepsis-related organ dysfunction in patients with sepsis: a randomized controlled trial [^116Vgz8q]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

A baseline-adjusted linear mixed model was fitted for the primary endpoint, namely, the mean total SOFA score with treatment and renal insufficiency/expected renal replacement as fixed effects and the study center as a random effect. The main effect of the intervention was tested in a confirmatory analysis at the two-sided significance level of 5% in the intention-to-treat population.

Additionally, the same model was applied for the total SOFA score at day 10 (or at earlier discharge from ICU) to explore the sensitivity regarding different definitions (mean total SOFA score day 1–day 10, total SOFA score at day 10) of the endpoint. Twenty-eight days all-cause mortality were compared by means of Fisher's exact test (two-sided), and relative risk with 95% confidence interval as well as group-wise absolute and relative frequencies are provided. Furthermore, Kaplan–Meier curves are provided for this endpoint and the log-rank test was performed to compare the survival curves.

SOFA subscores, length of stay (ICU, hospital), intervention-free days, total daily dose of piperacillin/tazobactam, duration of therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam, piperacillin concentrations up to day 10, and overall duration of antibiotic therapy were compared by independent samples t-test in case of normally distributed data or the Mann–Whitney U test otherwise. The mean ± SD (standard deviation) or median and interquartile range are reported for both groups. Q–Q plots were used to check if the data are normally distributed.

### Piperacillin-tazobactam-induced linear IgA bullous dermatosis presenting clinically as Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis overlap [^117NbkFB]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) is a subepidermal autoimmune bullous disease characterized by linear IgA deposition at the basement membrane zone, which is visualized by direct immunofluorescence. Patients with LABD typically present with widespread vesicles and bullae; however, this is not always the case, as the clinical presentation of this disease is heterogeneous. LABD presenting clinically as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is an infrequent yet well-described phenomenon. Most cases of LABD are idiopathic, but some are drug-induced. Multiple drugs have been implicated in the development of LABD. We report a case of piperacillin-tazobactam-induced LABD presenting clinically as SJS/TEN overlap. This is the first reported case of a strong causal association between piperacillin-tazobactam and the development of LABD.

### A rare association of bullous pemphigoid with mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome [^115Rd7gt]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid is a chronic autoimmune mucocutaneous subepidermal blistering disease associated with various autoimmune and neurologic conditions as well as certain medications. Although it is not found to be associated with overall malignancy, it may be linked to hematologic malignancies. Specifically, bullous pemphigoid has been rarely observed with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or mycosis fungoides.

Three reports describe the association of bullous pemphigoid with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and mycosis fungoides, in which blistering lesions of bullous pemphigoid manifested after ultraviolet phototherapy was initiated. At the time of writing, no cases of bullous pemphigoid with previously untreated mycosis fungoides with Sézary syndrome have been reported; here we describe the first such case to our knowledge.

### Definitions and outcome measures for bullous pemphigoid: Recommendations by an international panel of experts [^11547aDc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Our scientific knowledge of bullous pemphigoid (BP) has dramatically progressed in recent years. However, despite the availability of various therapeutic options for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, only a few multicenter controlled trials have helped to define effective therapies in BP. A major obstacle in sharing multicenter-based evidence for therapeutic efforts is the lack of generally accepted definitions for the clinical evaluation of patients with BP. Common terms and end points of BP are needed so that experts in the field can accurately measure and assess disease extent, activity, severity, and therapeutic response, thus facilitating and advancing clinical trials. These recommendations from the International Pemphigoid Committee represent two years of collaborative efforts to attain mutually acceptable common definitions for BP and propose a disease extent score, the BP Disease Area Index. These items should assist in the development of consistent reporting of outcomes in future BP reports and studies.

### Treatment of bullous pemphigoid with rituximab: Critical analysis of the current literature [^111Ygvzh]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this review was to critically analyze the currently available literature on the use of rituximab to treat patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP). The focus was to highlight clinical outcomes, treatment protocols, and adverse effects. A PubMed search from 2000 to the present day was conducted, using "bullous pemphigoid" and "rituximab" as keywords. Inclusion criteria were a description of the clinical disease, histology, and immunopathology typical of BP, the use of at least one infusion of rituximab, and the availability of follow-up after rituximab treatment.

Sixteen patients (12 adults and 4 children) were identified. Fourteen patients were treated according to the lymphoma protocol and two patients according to the rheumatoid arthritis protocol. In the final clinical outcome after treatment with rituximab, 11 out of 16 (69%) had a complete response, 1 (6%) had a partial response, 1 (6%) had no response, and 3 (19%) died. Two died of sepsis, including one child, and one died from cardiac effects. Three (20%) had serious infections. More than one cycle of rituximab was required in 38% of the patients who achieved a complete response. The mean follow-up period was 15.6 months (range 1–36), which is a serious limitation of the available data.

Rituximab is a useful option for BP patients who are recalcitrant to conventional therapy. A specific protocol for the use of rituximab to treat BP patients is not yet available. Since infection and mortality rates are of concern, careful and close monitoring may be necessary.

### Piperacillin-tazobactam induced immune hemolytic anemia led to increased renal impairment and eventual death from multiple organ failure in a patient with hypertensive nephropathy: case report and literature review [^116Rj9Ni]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

Drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia (DIIHA) is a side effect of medication that can cause serious consequences. The annual incidence of DIIHA with obvious anemia is 1–4 per million people. The mechanism of DIIHA is due to the immune damage to red blood cells (RBCs) caused by drug-induced antibodies, including drug-dependent antibodies and/or drug-independent antibodies, or non-immunologic protein adsorption (NIPA). It has been reported that nearly 140 kinds of drugs can cause DIIHA through drug-induced antibodies and 10 kinds of drugs with NIPA effect.

Piperacillin is a semi-synthetic penicillin effective against Pseudomonas, which belongs to the β-lactam broad-spectrum antibiotics and exerts bactericidal activity by inhibiting the synthesis of sensitive bacterial cell walls. Some pathogenic bacteria can produce β-lactamase, which makes them resistant to β-lactam antibiotics. Tazobactam is an irreversible competitive β-lactamase inhibitor. The combined administration of piperacillin and tazobactam can prevent pathogens that produce β-lactamase from being resistant to piperacillin, thereby expanding the antibacterial spectrum of piperacillin and improving the antibacterial effect. Piperacillin-tazobactam has been widely used for bacterial infections. However, piperacillin is one of the most common drugs that cause DIIHA and can cause fatal hemolytic anemia. Tazobactam has been confirmed to have NIPA effects and can cause mild hemolysis. Here we report a 79-year-old male patient with hypertensive nephropathy who developed severe hemolytic anemia during intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam administration.

### Treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced bullous pemphigoid with methotrexate [^117JfPiW]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune blistering disorder typically characterized by pruritic tense bullae caused by autoantibodies targeting the hemidesmosomal proteins BP180 and BP230. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are being increasingly utilized in the treatment of many malignancies; however, cutaneous immune-related adverse effects (cirAEs) are common. ICI-induced BP (ICI-BP) is a cirAE that affects 1.0% of ICI-treated patients. When left untreated, ICI-BP may lead to significant morbidity. In addition, immunosuppressive systemic therapies used to treat ICI-BP and/or ICI interruption required to adequately control ICI-BP may result in a worsening of the cancer prognosis. As a result, ICI-BP represents a particularly challenging cirAE in both oncological and dermatologic care, and the identification of therapeutic agents that manage the skin toxicity with minimal immunosuppression is of particular interest.

As a steroid-sparing, cost-effective, and widely available immunomodulator, methotrexate has demonstrated efficacy for ICI-induced psoriasis, BP unrelated to ICIs, and rheumatologic irAEs. Yet, methotrexate use in ICI-BP remains infrequently described. This retrospective review of four methotrexate-treated ICI-BP patients showed that all patients achieved BP resolution, discontinuing steroids on average 4.0 months after starting methotrexate. Methotrexate was well-tolerated; only one patient (25%) experienced mild side effects (fatigue, gastrointestinal upset). These cases and a review of similarly published cases highlight methotrexate as a safe, effective treatment option for ICI-BP.

### Efficacy of dapsone in the treatment of pemphigus and pemphigoid: Analysis of current data [^111MPo6Q]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Dapsone is a chemotherapeutic agent primarily used in treating leprosy, Pneumocystis jiroveci (previously carinii) pneumonia, and malaria. It is also used as an adjuvant in the treatment of pemphigus and pemphigoid. To assess the role of dapsone in the treatment of pemphigus and pemphigoid, a retrospective review of reports in the English-language literature was conducted. Information on the number of patients treated, their average age, prior therapies, indications for use, protocol (dose and interval) used, concomitant therapies, reported adverse effects, and clinical outcomes were analyzed.

There were 35 case reports and series published describing the use of dapsone in a total of 427 patients. Data on 55 pemphigus patients were obtained from several case reports and some case series and one randomized controlled trial. Of these, 32 patients with pemphigus vulgaris and 14 patients with pemphigus foliaceus responded to dapsone. Data from 13 case series, each including at least five patients, accounted for 372 patients with pemphigoid. The overall response rates to dapsone, when given either alone or in combination with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents, were 84% in mucous membrane pemphigoid and 81% in bullous pemphigoid. Hemolysis was the most common adverse effect observed.

Dapsone is a promising and useful agent in patients with autoimmune mucocutaneous blistering diseases, especially in mucous membrane pemphigoid. It can be used as a corticosteroid-sparing agent. Therefore, its combined use with oral corticosteroids may be useful in pemphigus vulgaris and bullous pemphigoid.

### Piperacillin-tazobactam induced immune hemolytic anemia led to increased renal impairment and eventual death from multiple organ failure in a patient with hypertensive nephropathy: case report and literature review [^117H7kMb]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

Serological test results

The results of the direct antiglobulin test (DAT) for anti-IgG with a Coombs card (Diagnostic Grifols, S. A.) of blood samples collected on days 2, 1, and 0 before stopping piperacillin-tazobactam administration were strongly positive (4+). After stopping the administration of piperacillin-tazobactam, the DAT for anti-IgG results gradually weakened and turned negative until 12 days after the administration of piperacillin-tazobactam was stopped. The results of the DAT for anti-C3d (Shanghai Blood Biomedical Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China) with the tube method of all blood samples were negative. The irregular RBC antibody test using plasma was weakly positive before stopping and became negative after stopping piperacillin-tazobactam administration.

The weakly positive results may be due to the presence of piperacillin in the patient's plasma, and the piperacillin-dependent antibodies may have agglutinated with the RBCs. The irregular RBC antibody tests using the acid eluent (acid elution reagents were produced by Guangzhou Zhanquan Biotech Co. Ltd.) collected before and after the patient stopped the administration of piperacillin-tazobactam were all negative. Following previous reports, the detection of drug-dependent antibodies in the presence of a drug solution and using drug-coated RBCs was performed. In a previous study, piperacillin may be more suitable for coating RBCs under high pH and room temperature conditions.

### Bullous pemphigoid during ustekinumab therapy [^112LUDeJ]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Many drugs may induce bullous pemphigoid (BP), including antibiotics (penicillin, fluoroquinolone, chloroquine, rifampicin), diuretics (furosemide, spironolactone), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Although an association between the frequency of BP and psoriasis may exist, several cases of BP have been attributed to anti-TNF-α agents. To our knowledge, no case of BP has been described during ustekinumab use, but its mechanism of action, leading to down-regulation of TNF-α, makes it possibly accountable. Ustekinumab blocks the differentiation and clonal expression of Th1 and Th17 effector cells, resulting in a reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α agents. Although the mechanism is not yet understood, the modification of the immune response could cause the onset of BP.

Other effects of inflammatory or immune skin disorders have also been reported with ustekinumab use, including cases of alopecia areata, linear IgA dermatosis, and eczema, suggesting the potential consequences of this cytokine imbalance. In our case, several factors argue in favor of an iatrogenic origin: the relatively early age of onset, the acute and limited nature of the lesions, their rapid regression after stopping ustekinumab, and no recurrence after 18 months. Metformin's causation was less probable since the patient had been on this medication for many years and no cases of BP with metformin use have been reported. Additionally, infliximab may have had an impact on this patient's BP, as this treatment was introduced a few months after the cessation of ustekinumab.

### Bullous impetigo masquerading as pemphigus foliaceus in an adult patient [^113vw2BE]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Bullous impetigo (BI) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF) are two distinct cutaneous conditions with substantial clinical overlap. BI is a common, highly contagious cutaneous infection often affecting children, whereas PF is a relatively rare autoimmune blistering condition. Lesions arise from the disruption of desmoglein-1, a desmosomal protein required for keratinocyte adhesion, by an epidermolytic toxin or IgG autoantibodies, respectively. Given their shared pathophysiology, it is not surprising that these diseases can have similar clinical presentations and have been mistaken for one another in the literature. Correct diagnosis is critical, as BI is managed with antibiotics to curb rapid spread, and the disease course of PF is meaningfully affected by early systemic immunosuppression. We discuss the diagnosis of a case of BI masquerading as PF and the means of distinguishing the two cutaneous conditions.

### Bullous pemphigoid: Simple measures for a complex disease [^116B3PSK]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Simple descriptive population data are potentially helpful in understanding how bullous pemphigoid (BP) originates and evolves over time. Before embarking on etiological correlations, artifacts and biases should be ruled out. Ideally, epidemiological data should be complemented by immunological and genetic analyses aimed at providing better insight into the causation and prognosis of BP.

### Treatment of bullous pemphigoid with dupilumab: A case series of 30 patients [^116FrYJz]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid is often difficult to treat with the limited therapies available. Here, we describe clinical outcomes among 30 adults with bullous pemphigoid treated with dupilumab. We performed a multicenter, retrospective case series between March 2020 and August 2022. Patients received a loading dose of dupilumab 600 mg, followed by a 300 mg maintenance dose with varying administration frequency tailored to individual patient response. All patients experienced at least some improvement in blister formation and pruritus, with 23 (76.7%) of patients demonstrating either complete clearance of blistering or marked response. Complete clearance of pruritus or marked response was noted in 25 (83.3%) of patients. Eight patients were effectively maintained solely on dupilumab. One (3.3%) patient reported an injection site reaction.

Thirty patients represent a small sample; however, to our knowledge, this is the second largest group of BP treated with dupilumab. Furthermore, we provide an understandable framework for clinicians outside of academics to follow and assess treatment responses in their BP patients treated with dupilumab. Dupilumab should be considered as a therapeutic option in patients with bullous pemphigoid given its ability to induce sustained blistering and pruritus response in both typical and refractory cases while maintaining a favorable safety profile.

### Exploring different objectives in non-inferiority trials [^113qUFaz]. BMJ (2024). High credibility.

- **Example of a hypothetical risk-benefit frontier**: The Bullous Pemphigoid Steroids and Tetracyclines (BLISTER) trial proposed using different non-inferiority margins (% absolute difference), depending on the observed reduction in mortality (% absolute difference) in the new treatment arm compared with the control arm, with a greater difference allowing a wider margin. Margin values were obtained at two values of the difference in mortality (circles, one for declaration of the new intervention as an alternative option and one for replacement). Lines between the two points were plotted to show a hypothetical frontier of proposed margins at intermediate values for the difference in mortality, illustrating how a more granular range for the non-inferiority margin could be used. Each measured value for the additional benefit could be associated with a non-inferiority margin or with two non-inferiority margins by agreeing values for an alternative option and for a replacement, as shown here, and plotting the curve. Data from Williams et al.

A proposed value for the non-inferiority margin based on one of these two methods could then be agreed upon and used for the trial design. If the process is carefully prespecified, however, the margin might be re-evaluated based on the other benefits seen in the trial, or the final analysis might be conducted without reference to a margin.

- **Choice of outcomes**: The primary outcome, chosen to measure the efficacy of the treatment, will typically be an established measure for the disease being studied.

### Wound penetration of cefazolin, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin, tazobactam, and vancomycin during negative pressure wound therapy [^111coExF]. Advances in Wound Care (2017). Low credibility.

Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) uses subatmospheric pressure as a noninvasive adjunct to treat wounds and has demonstrated clinical efficacy by accelerating the healing of various acute and chronic wounds. NPWT may also play a role in preventing or treating wound infections by increasing wound penetration of antibiotics; however, clinical data in patients undergoing antibiotic and NPWT treatment are limited.

To evaluate wound penetration of antibiotics in NPWT patients, a prospective, observational study was conducted with burn and trauma patients treated with NPWT and systemic antibiotics. The plasma pharmacokinetic profiles of systemic vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, cefazolin, and piperacillin/tazobactam were evaluated, along with total and unbound antibiotic concentrations in wound exudate from the same patients.

Data from 32 patients with 37 wounds undergoing NPWT demonstrated that vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam effectively penetrated wounds, with exudate to plasma concentration ratios greater than 0.8. In contrast, cefazolin did not penetrate wounds as effectively in patients undergoing NPWT, displaying an average exudate to plasma concentration ratio of 0.51.

Clinical data on wound penetration of antibiotics in patients undergoing NPWT are limited, but these results suggest that antibiotics have differing capacities for wound penetration during NPWT. This should be considered when making clinical decisions. This initial report suggests that vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam are effective in wound penetration.

### Burn injury and augmented renal clearance: A case for optimized piperacillin-tazobactam dosing [^112zR9TZ]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2023). Low credibility.

Patients with burn injuries are at high risk for infection as well as altered antimicrobial pharmacokinetics. Those suffering from burn injuries, generally encompassing a total body surface area (TBSA) ≥ 20%, have been cited as at risk for augmented renal clearance (ARC). Our case report describes an obese patient with 3.2% TBSA partial thickness burns who suffered from burn wound cellulitis with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Measured CLcr documented the presence of ARC, and a 22.5 grams daily continuous infusion of piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated. Therapeutic monitoring of piperacillin at steady state was 78 mcg/mL, achieving the prespecified goal piperacillin concentration of 100% 4-times the minimum inhibitory concentration assuming MIC for susceptible P. aeruginosa at 16/4 mcg/mL per the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute.

Available literature suggests younger critically ill patients with lower organ failure scores, and for a burn injury, a higher percentage of TBSA are most likely to exhibit ARC, which does not entirely align with the characteristics of our patient. In addition, piperacillin-tazobactam has been associated with altered pharmacokinetics in ARC, burn, and obese populations, demonstrating failure to meet target attainment with standard doses. We suggest a continuous infusion of piperacillin-tazobactam be used when ARC is identified. This case report describes the unique findings of ARC in a non-critically ill burn patient and rationalizes the need for further prospective research to classify incidence, risk factors, and appropriate antimicrobial regimens.

### Zosyn [^112eSkYj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

There have been postmarketing reports of overdose with piperacillin and tazobactam. The majority of these events, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, have also been reported with the usual recommended dosages. If higher than recommended doses are administered intravenously, particularly in the presence of renal failure, patients may experience neuromuscular excitability or seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Treatment should be supportive and symptomatic according to the patient's clinical presentation. Excessive serum concentrations of either piperacillin or tazobactam may be reduced by hemodialysis. Following a single 3.375 g dose, the percentage of the piperacillin and tazobactam dose removed by hemodialysis was approximately 31% and 39%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)].

### Minocycline as a therapeutic option in bullous pemphigoid [^112xKnte]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

We present a retrospective analysis of patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP) treated with minocycline in the Department of Dermatology, Churchill Hospital, Oxford, between July 1986 and May 2000. More than 200 patients with BP were seen in the clinic during the review period. Of these, 22 patients were treated with minocycline, mostly as adjuvant therapy. The response to treatment was assessed by clinical improvement and whether the dose of concomitant immunosuppressive drugs was subsequently reduced. A major response was seen in six patients, a minor response in 11, and no response in five patients. Minocycline was discontinued in four patients because of the occurrence of side effects. Overall analysis revealed marked clinical benefits of minocycline in BP; however, this is a non-placebo controlled study and should now be followed by a prospective double-blind controlled clinical trial.

### Assessing the effect of piperacillin/tazobactam on hematological parameters in patients admitted with moderate or severe foot infections [^112Tsg9S]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

In 2015, worldwide, the prevalence of diabetes in adults aged between 20 and 79 years old was estimated at 415 million people, at an annual global cost of approximately US$1.3 trillion. A significant part of this cost was due to acute hospital admissions. Diabetic foot infections are common and are the most common reason for a "diabetes-specific" acute hospital admission, accounting for the most hospital days of all diabetes-related complications.

Most moderate to severe diabetic foot infections are due to polymicrobial colonization of tissue by Gram-positive cocci, aerobic Gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes. As such, the empirical use of broad-spectrum antibiotics prior to sensitivities being available has proved to be clinically effective, with reported rates of clinical resolution between 77% and 94%. Piperacillin/tazobactam (Tazocin®, Pfizer Ltd, Sandwich, UK) is an antibiotic containing the extended-spectrum agent piperacillin together with the β-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam. The drug has activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Because of its extended spectrum, the drug has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe diabetic foot infections, showing an advantage over ertapenem. Consequently, piperacillin/tazobactam is commonly recommended as first-line empirical treatment owing to its high efficacy and relative safety compared with other antibiotics.

The manufacturer's package leaflet for piperacillin/tazobactam has documented that pancytopenia is a side effect.

### Piperacillin-tazobactam induced immune hemolytic anemia led to increased renal impairment and eventual death from multiple organ failure in a patient with hypertensive nephropathy: case report and literature review [^115tPBQg]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

According to the methods of previous reports, 1 mg/ml is the standard drug concentration used to detect drug-dependent antibodies in the presence of soluble drugs. However, a serological study by Leger et al. on piperacillin-dependent antibodies showed that piperacillin solutions with a concentration of 1–10 mg/ml can detect piperacillin-dependent antibodies in patients with DIIHA caused by piperacillin. When there is a high concentration of piperacillin, the piperacillin-dependent antibody response will be stronger. Therefore, we used a 3 mg/ml piperacillin solution to detect piperacillin-dependent antibodies and a 1 mg/ml tazobactam solution to detect the presence of tazobactam-related antibodies.

The patient in this study had a hemoglobin level of 72 g/L before the administration of piperacillin-tazobactam. They underwent three courses within three months with a total intravenous administration of 368 g of piperacillin-tazobactam, during which a total of LRBCs prepared from 5200 mL of whole blood were infused. The hemoglobin level was 66 g/L after the last infusion of LRBCs. The patient had severe hypertensive renal impairment.

During the first course of piperacillin-tazobactam administration, multiple treatments, including CRRT, hemodialysis, and blood transfusions, were given. Because of these treatments and the potentially low strength of the piperacillin-dependent antibodies, the patient did not show obvious clinical characteristics of DIIHA. However, significantly aggravated renal damage occurred after the CRRT was stopped during the second and third courses of piperacillin-tazobactam administration, with severe hemolytic anemia occurring in the third course of piperacillin-tazobactam treatment.

### Treatment concerns for bullous pemphigoid in the COVID-19 pandemic era [^115h9RBF]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common autoimmune blistering disease with subepidermal involvement, typically affecting the elderly. It has spontaneous remissions and exacerbations with significant morbidity. A novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the new universal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The pandemic raised concerns, especially about immunosuppressive therapy. In this article, we reviewed the management of BP in the COVID-19 pandemic era. The data about the best management of autoimmune bullous diseases like BP during the outbreak of COVID-19 are evolving and updated every day.

### Spectrum of clinical responses to therapies in infantile bullous pemphigoid [^116WNDjD]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Infantile bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a rare autoimmune dermatosis characterized by the presence of antibodies against basal membrane zone proteins. While the histologic and immunologic features are similar to those in the adult form of the disease, its clinical features may vary in children. We report here four cases of infantile BP whose atypical presentation or progression sheds new light on the disease.

### Development of bullous pemphigoid during nivolumab therapy [^1128AGGb]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a new class of cancer therapeutics that promote antitumor immune responses. Currently, U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved agents target the coregulatory molecules programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and show significant activity in multiple cancer types. These medications can induce a variety of cutaneous eruptions, the full spectrum of which is not yet completely characterized. Here, we report a case of bullous pemphigoid (BP), which began shortly after initiating treatment with the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab.

In this study, a web-based ensemble learning (EL) model, integrating logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF), was developed to predict the clinical effectiveness of TZP (4:1) as the primary therapeutic strategy for treating bacterial LRTIs using patient clinical data. The model demonstrated balanced performance across key evaluation metrics. This tool has the potential to aid clinicians in optimizing antibiotic prescribing and mitigating the development of antibiotic resistance.

### Tetracycline and niacinamide control bullous pemphigoid but not pemphigus foliaceus when these conditions coexist [^112N27g7]. The Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Pemphigus and pemphigoid are different types of autoimmune bullous diseases that can coexist in the same patient. We report a female patient with this condition. Initially, she was diagnosed with bullous pemphigoid and treated with tetracycline, niacinamide, and a topical steroid. While the tense bullae disappeared shortly after treatment, crusted erythemas persisted, particularly on the head and trunk. We conducted BP180 and desmoglein 1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and examined histological features, which confirmed the coexistence of bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus foliaceus. Consequently, we administered prednisolone, which effectively controlled both conditions. This case demonstrates that while tetracycline and niacinamide can control bullous pemphigoid, they are ineffective in managing pemphigus foliaceus, whereas prednisolone is effective for both conditions.

### Tazicef [^116wtAH9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Ceftazidime is generally well tolerated. The incidence of adverse reactions associated with ceftazidime administration was low in clinical trials. The most common were local reactions following IV injection, along with allergic and gastrointestinal reactions. Other adverse reactions were encountered infrequently, and no disulfiram-like reactions were reported.

The following adverse effects from clinical trials were considered to be either related to ceftazidime therapy or were of uncertain etiology:

- **Local effects**: Reported in fewer than 2% of patients, phlebitis and inflammation occurred at the injection site (1 in 69 patients).

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Reported in 2% of patients, these included pruritus, rash, and fever. Immediate reactions, generally manifested by rash and/or pruritus, occurred in 1 in 285 patients. Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and erythema multiforme have also been reported with cephalosporin antibacterial drugs, including ceftazidime. Angioedema and anaphylaxis (bronchospasm and/or hypotension) have been reported very rarely.

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Reported in fewer than 2% of patients, these included diarrhea (1 in 78), nausea (1 in 156), vomiting (1 in 500), and abdominal pain (1 in 416). The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after treatment (see WARNINGS).

### Effect of cefepime/enmetazobactam vs piperacillin/tazobactam on clinical cure and microbiological eradication in patients with complicated urinary tract infection or acute pyelonephritis: A randomized clinical trial [^114ejPaL]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

The study ALLIUM, published by Keith S. Kaye and colleagues in 2022 in the journal JAMA, addresses diseases such as acute pyelonephritis, acute cystitis, and complicated urinary tract infection. The key question investigated in the ALLIUM study was whether cefepime/enmetazobactam is superior to piperacillin/tazobactam in patients with complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis.

The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT) involving 1,034 patients, consisting of 568 females and 466 males. The inclusion criteria specified adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis caused by Gram-negative urinary pathogens. Key exclusion criteria included a urine culture with a Gram-positive primary pathogen, hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to the trial drugs, weight over 180 kg, and life expectancy less than the six-week study period.

The interventions included:

- **Cefepime/enmetazobactam group (n = 516)**: Patients received cefepime 2 g/enmetazobactam 0.5 g administered by a 2-hour infusion every 8 hours for 7 days.
- **Piperacillin/tazobactam group (n = 518)**: Patients received piperacillin 4 g/tazobactam 0.5 g administered by a 2-hour infusion every 8 hours for 7 days.

- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant increase in overall treatment success at day 14 (79.1% vs. 58.9%; absolute difference 21.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 14.3 to 27.9).
- **Secondary outcomes**: There was no significant difference in clinical cure at day 14 (92.5% vs. 88.9%; absolute difference 3.5%, 95% CI -1 to 8). There was a significant increase in microbiological eradication at day 14 (82.9% vs. 64.9%; absolute difference 19%, 95% CI 12.3 to 25.4).

### Comparison of four antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods to determine the in vitro activities of piperacillin and piperacillin-tazobactam against clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^112sYLYT]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

Susceptibility to piperacillin was similar to that to piperacillin-tazobactam (< 1% difference) for 6,938 isolates of Enterobacter aerogenes and 13,954 isolates of Enterobacter cloacae tested using a Vitek system. In contrast, for the same species, susceptibility rates to piperacillin-tazobactam were 5.9 to 13.9% higher than to piperacillin using disk diffusion, MicroScan, and Vitek 2 testing.

Unprecedented phenotypes (piperacillin susceptible and piperacillin-tazobactam intermediate; piperacillin intermediate and piperacillin-tazobactam resistant; piperacillin susceptible and piperacillin-tazobactam resistant) accounted for 6.1% of the results for E. aerogenes isolates and 6.0% of the results for E. cloacae isolates tested with the Vitek system.

### A national retrospective cohort study comparing the effects of cefepime versus piperacillin-tazobactam on the development of severe acute kidney injury in patients with septic shock [^115FXj2u]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam are commonly used broad-spectrum antibiotics used to treat patients with potential gram-negative bacterial sepsis. Piperacillin-tazobactam has been shown to be associated with acute kidney injury (AKI). However, it has not been compared with cefepime in patients with septic shock. We compared the effects of cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam on the incidence of severe AKI in patients with septic shock.

This was a retrospective, multicenter, inverse probability-of-treatment weighted cohort study conducted in 220 geographically diverse community and teaching hospitals across the United States. Adult patients were included if they had septic shock on hospital admission and received cefepime or piperacillin-tazobactam. The proportions of patients in whom stage 3 AKI occurred during hospitalization were compared between groups.

Of the 8,427 patients included in the final cohort, 4,569 received cefepime and 3,858 received piperacillin-tazobactam. Patients had a mean (SD) age of 66.2 (15.2) years, and 45.3% were female; the mean (SD) estimated glomerular filtration rate was 48 (24) mL/min/1.73 m² on the day of admission. In the weighted cohort, stage 3 AKI occurred in 9.9% receiving cefepime and 9.8% receiving piperacillin-tazobactam (odds ratio, 0.98 [95% confidence interval, .84–1.15]; p = 0.82). In terms of secondary outcomes, there was no significant difference between cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam with regard to renal replacement therapy, in-hospital death, and major adverse kidney events.

### Treatment of bullous pemphigoid [^115YddEr]. The Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most frequent autoimmune blistering skin disease. Until recently, it was treated with oral corticosteroids. However, high-dose steroids are poorly tolerated in the elderly and likely contributed to the high mortality rates observed in several cohorts. For years, efforts have been devoted to finding steroid-sparing agents, including immunosuppressive drugs, plasma exchanges, intravenous immunoglobulins, and tetracycline. Many showed promise in open series but proved ineffective or marginally effective when tested in randomized controlled trials.

An important breakthrough was demonstrated by a large randomized trial showing that a "super-potent" topical corticosteroid (clobetasol propionate) was not only associated with a significant decrease in severe complications and mortality of BP patients but was also more effective than oral prednisone. New strategies for BP should include topical clobetasol propionate as the first-line treatment and consider adjuvant therapy only in the rare cases that are either resistant to or intolerant of this treatment.

### Zosyn [^115fD5qK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Zosyn is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

- **Mechanism of action**:

- **Pharmacodynamics**: The pharmacodynamic parameter for piperacillin and tazobactam that is most predictive of clinical and microbiological efficacy is time above MIC.

- **Pharmacokinetics**:

	- **Cmax**: maximum observed concentration
	- **AUC**: area under the curve
	- **CL**: clearance
	- **CLR**: renal clearance
	- **V**: volume of distribution
	- **T₁/₂**: elimination half-life

Peak plasma concentrations of piperacillin and tazobactam are attained immediately after completion of an intravenous infusion of Zosyn. Piperacillin plasma concentrations, following a 30-minute infusion of Zosyn, were similar to those attained when equivalent doses of piperacillin were administered alone. Steady-state plasma concentrations of piperacillin and tazobactam were similar to those attained after the first dose due to the short half-lives of piperacillin and tazobactam.

### Two cases with bullous pemphigoid relapsed after using interleukin-17A inhibitors for psoriasis: A paradoxical reaction [^116yVqR7]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Biological drugs, including IL-17A inhibitors, have become the first-line treatment options for moderate to severe psoriasis, and reports show a beneficial effect of IL-17A inhibitors on bullous pemphigoid. Here, we report two cases of bullous pemphigoid in remission that experienced severe flares during treatment with two major IL-17A inhibitors, i.e. ixekizumab or secukinumab, for their psoriasis vulgaris. The patient with bullous pemphigoid induced by secukinumab became very recalcitrant to control the relapse. This is by far the first and paradoxical report on the IL-17A inhibitors having a negative effect on bullous pemphigoid patients in previously stable status. Our reports of these two cases alert clinicians to be careful when using IL-17A inhibitors in pemphigoid patients. We also suggest that patients with psoriasis vulgaris should be asked for a detailed history of pemphigoid, and its BP180 autoantibodies status should be checked before using these biologicals.

### The association of bullous pemphigoid with dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors: A ten-year prospective observational study [^113YNYJA]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid is the most common bullous chronic autoimmune skin disease. Recent studies have suggested dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors as possible predisposing agents of bullous pemphigoid. The objective of our study was to prospectively estimate the association between gliptins and the development of bullous pemphigoid.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective study which included all patients diagnosed with biopsy-proven bullous pemphigoid in the Dermatology Department of our hospital between April 1, 2009, and December 31, 2019. The diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid was based on specific clinical, histological, and immunological features.

- **Results**: Overall, 113 consecutive patients (age 75 ± 13 years, 62 females) with the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid were enrolled. Seventy-six patients (67.3%) suffered from type 2 diabetes and 52 (46%) were treated with dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors. The most frequently prescribed gliptin was vildagliptin, administered to 45 cases (39.8% of total patients enrolled, 86.5% of the patients treated with gliptins). Gliptins were withdrawn immediately after the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid, which together with steroid administration led to remission of the rash.

- **Conclusions**: This study revealed that treatment with dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors, especially vildagliptin, is significantly associated with an increased risk of bullous pemphigoid development.
