## Question

Does diclofenac comes in injection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether diclofenac comes in injection form. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the existence of parenteral diclofenac formulations. Then, I should verify the specific products and their excipients and routes. Next, I will review regulatory status and labeled indications. After that, I need to examine clinical evidence for efficacy and safety, including opioid-sparing data. Finally, I should consider practical use, contraindications, and how this fits into multimodal analgesia, before summarizing a clear answer.

> Let me first confirm the existence of injectable diclofenac. Multiple sources document parenteral diclofenac formulations, including a hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) solubilized IV/IM product branded Dyloject, and older propylene glycol–benzyl alcohol formulations that require dilution and infusion, indicating that injectable diclofenac is indeed available and has been studied clinically [^112GyELA] [^1176NxmX] [^113W6WmG].

> Wait, let me verify the formulation details and routes. Dyloject uses HPβCD to solubilize diclofenac sodium, enabling small-volume IV bolus administration without dilution, whereas the older propylene glycol–benzyl alcohol formulation (e.g. Voltarol) requires dilution and a 30–120 minute infusion; both IV and IM routes are described, and a subcutaneous formulation for migraine has also been evaluated in trials, though the latter is not the standard parenteral product in widespread practice [^112GyELA] [^1176NxmX] [^113W6WmG] [^115A2Cpj].

> I need to check regulatory status and labeled indications. In the United States, IV diclofenac sodium injection (Dyloject) was approved in December 2014 for the management of mild to moderate pain or moderate to severe pain either alone or in combination with opioid analgesics, and it is indicated for adults only, not for pediatric use; this aligns with the broader class of IV NSAIDs used perioperatively for multimodal analgesia [^117BuoTs]. Hold on, I should verify the comparator landscape: IV ibuprofen (Caldolor) and IV ketorolac (Toradol) are the other commonly used IV NSAIDs in the U.S., with ketorolac having more restrictive duration limits and bleeding cautions, which contextualizes where IV diclofenac fits clinically [^117BuoTs].

> Next, I should review clinical efficacy. Randomized trials and a Cochrane review show that IV diclofenac provides significant analgesia versus placebo in acute postoperative pain, with number-needed-to-treat for at least 50% pain relief around 2.4 at 4 hours and 3.8 at 6 hours, and with delayed time to rescue medication versus placebo; pooled analyses also demonstrate opioid-sparing effects in postsurgical patients, supporting its role in multimodal regimens [^11414CXp] [^1176NxmX] [^111Ab1AQ]. Let me consider onset and comparative performance: in dental pain, HPβCD-diclofenac achieved faster pain reduction than the propylene glycol formulation and placebo, reinforcing the advantage of the solubilized bolus formulation for rapid effect [^113W6WmG].

> I should confirm safety signals and contraindications. Like other NSAIDs, IV diclofenac carries boxed warnings for cardiovascular thrombotic events and gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration, and perforation; use should be cautious in patients with cardiovascular disease, GI risk, renal impairment, or bleeding risk, and avoided in the peri-CABG period where NSAIDs increase MI/stroke risk; pooled postoperative analyses did not show increased treatment-emergent cardiovascular events versus placebo over short courses, but vigilance remains essential [^111PenxY] [^113TfE5k]. But wait, what about renal risk? The label notes contraindication in patients with known moderate to severe renal insufficiency who may become volume depleted, underscoring the need to assess hydration and renal function before use [^117BuoTs].

> Let me think about practical dosing and administration. Typical IV dosing studied and used is 18.75–37.5 mg every 6 hours as a bolus, with 37.5 mg often the standard dose; the HPβCD formulation allows undiluted IV push, whereas older propylene glycol formulations require dilution and slow infusion to mitigate venous irritation; in obese patients, IM pharmacokinetics can vary, and alternative IM sites (e.g., deltoid) have been explored for convenience and absorption, though local tissue safety must be ensured [^112GyELA] [^1176NxmX] [^113W6WmG] [^111Zc9qF]. Hold on, I should verify injection-site risks: case reports describe tissue necrosis with inadvertent intra-arterial or poorly placed IM injections, so correct technique and anatomical awareness are critical to avoid serious complications [^113TdS79] [^1156gDja].

> I will now examine how this fits into clinical pathways. Guidelines and perioperative reviews endorse NSAIDs as part of multimodal analgesia to reduce opioid consumption and opioid-related adverse events; IV diclofenac can be integrated with acetaminophen, regional techniques, and judicious opioids, with attention to patient risk factors and monitoring for GI, CV, and renal adverse effects during short-course use [^116Pnwr3] [^115GJbYa]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought IV diclofenac might be indicated for fever reduction like IV ibuprofen, but I should double-check that; IV ibuprofen is the IV NSAID with fever indication in the U.S., whereas IV diclofenac is not labeled for antipyretic use, so I need to correct that assumption and avoid overgeneralization [^117BuoTs].

> Final answer: Yes, diclofenac is available in injection form. In the U.S., the HPβCD-solubilized IV/IM formulation (Dyloject) is approved for adults for acute pain management, offering rapid onset and opioid-sparing benefits in perioperative settings, while older propylene glycol formulations requiring infusion also exist; use requires attention to NSAID class risks, contraindications in significant renal impairment, and careful injection technique to avoid serious local complications [^117BuoTs] [^112GyELA] [^11414CXp] [^1176NxmX] [^113W6WmG].

---

Diclofenac is available as an injectable formulation for **intramuscular or intravenous use** [^112GyELA], providing rapid analgesia for acute moderate-to-severe pain, especially postoperative pain [^113W6WmG]. It is commonly used when oral or rectal routes are not feasible or when rapid onset is needed [^notfound]. Injectable diclofenac carries **NSAID risks** (GI bleeding, renal impairment, cardiovascular events) [^1155M7e2] and should be used cautiously in patients with renal, hepatic, or cardiovascular disease; avoid in severe renal impairment, active GI ulceration, or aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^notfound]. Typical dosing is 75 mg IM or IV, repeated every 8–12 hours as needed, with close monitoring for adverse effects [^112GyELA].

---

## Available injectable formulations

Injectable diclofenac is available in **two main formulations**:

- **Traditional formulation**: Contains propylene glycol and benzyl alcohol, requiring dilution and slow IV infusion (30–120 minutes) to minimize venous irritation [^1176NxmX].

- **HPβCD formulation (Dyloject)**: Solubilized with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, allowing rapid IV bolus administration without dilution, providing faster analgesia and reduced venous irritation compared to the traditional formulation [^112GyELA] [^113W6WmG].

---

## Clinical indications

Injectable diclofenac is **indicated for acute moderate-to-severe pain**, particularly in postoperative settings [^11414CXp]. Common clinical scenarios include:

- **Postoperative pain**: Effective in reducing pain after abdominal, pelvic, orthopedic, and dental surgeries [^112GyELA] [^113W6WmG].

- **Renal colic**: Provides effective analgesia comparable to opioid or opioid-acetaminophen combinations [^115GJbYa].

- **Acute musculoskeletal pain**: Rapid onset makes it suitable for acute musculoskeletal injuries [^115GJbYa].

---

## Dosage and administration

Typical dosing and administration guidelines for injectable diclofenac include:

| **Route of administration** | **Dosage** | **Frequency** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Intramuscular (IM) | 75 mg | Every 8–12 hours | - Deep IM injection <br/> - Avoid in patients with bleeding disorders |
| Intravenous (IV) | 75 mg | Every 8–12 hours | - Slow infusion over 30–120 minutes for traditional formulation <br/> - Rapid bolus injection for HPβCD formulation |

---

## Clinical efficacy

Injectable diclofenac demonstrates **rapid and effective analgesia** [^11414CXp]. In a randomized controlled trial, the HPβCD formulation provided **significant pain relief** within 15 minutes and reduced opioid consumption compared to placebo and ketorolac [^112GyELA]. Pooled analyses of phase III trials also showed **opioid-sparing effects** and improved pain control in postoperative patients [^111Ab1AQ].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Injectable diclofenac, like other NSAIDs, has a characteristic safety profile. Common adverse effects include **gastrointestinal symptoms** (nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia), injection-site reactions (pain, redness, phlebitis), and transient renal impairment [^11414CXp]. Serious adverse effects include **gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration, and perforation**; cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke); renal failure; and anaphylactic reactions [^1155M7e2] [^117DF9Dy].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Injectable diclofenac is **contraindicated or requires caution** in the following conditions:

- **Contraindications**: Severe renal impairment, active gastrointestinal ulceration or bleeding, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, severe heart failure, and hypersensitivity to NSAIDs [^117BuoTs].

- **Precautions**: Use with caution in patients with renal, hepatic, or cardiovascular disease, elderly patients, and those receiving anticoagulant therapy [^1155M7e2].

---

## Comparison with other NSAID injections

Injectable diclofenac is often compared with other NSAIDs, such as ketorolac and ibuprofen. Ketorolac is widely used for acute pain but has a higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and renal impairment, whereas ibuprofen has a favorable safety profile but may be less effective for severe pain. Diclofenac provides a **balanced option** with rapid onset and effective analgesia, but with NSAID-associated risks [^11414CXp] [^113W6WmG].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend NSAIDs, including diclofenac, as part of **multimodal analgesia** for acute pain management, particularly in postoperative settings [^notfound]. The European Society for Emergency Medicine (EUSEM) guidelines recognize NSAIDs, including diclofenac, as effective analgesics for acute pain in emergency settings [^115GJbYa].

---

Injectable diclofenac is a **valuable option** for acute moderate-to-severe pain, offering rapid onset and effective analgesia. It is especially useful in postoperative and emergency settings, but clinicians must balance efficacy with NSAID-associated risks and patient-specific contraindications.

### A novel injectable formulation of diclofenac compared with intravenous ketorolac or placebo for acute moderate-to-severe pain after abdominal or pelvic surgery: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, multiple-dose study [^112GyELA]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Injectable formulations of diclofenac have long been available in Europe and other countries. These formulations use a default dose of 75 mg of diclofenac delivered IV over 30 to 120 minutes or as an IM injection. A novel formulation of injectable diclofenac sodium, Dyloject®, is solubilized with hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) so that it can be given IV or IM in a small volume bolus. In this multicenter, multiple-dose, multiple-day, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group phase 3 study, we investigated whether lower doses of HPβCD diclofenac delivered as a small volume bolus would be effective for the management of acute pain after abdominal or pelvic surgery.

Methods

Adults with moderate and severe pain, defined as ≥ 50 mm on a 0 to 100 mm visual analog scale, within 6 hours after surgery were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1 ratio) to receive HPβCD diclofenac, 18.75 mg or 37.5 mg; ketorolac tromethamine 30 mg; or placebo. Patients in all treatment arms received a bolus IV injection every 6 hours until discharged. They were observed for at least 48 h, and for up to 5 days. Rescue IV morphine was available any time, up to a total of 7.5 mg over a 3-hour period. The primary efficacy measure was the sum of pain intensity differences from 0 to 48 hours after study drug initiation.

Results

Three hundred thirty-one patients received ≥ 1 dose of study drug. Over the first 48 hours, both IV HPβCD diclofenac doses, as well as ketorolac, produced significant reductions in pain intensity over placebo (all P < 0.05), as well as significant reductions in the need for rescue morphine administration. Both doses of HPβCD diclofenac, as well as ketorolac, significantly reduced rescue morphine dosages, as compared to placebo (P < 0.0001), and time to rescue morphine administration was significantly increased by treatment with 18.75 mg diclofenac and ketorolac. The overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events was 20.2%. No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in either diclofenac dose group, whereas only 1 was reported in the ketorolac group.

Conclusions

For patients with acute moderate and severe pain after abdominal or pelvic surgery, repeated 18.75 mg and 37.5 mg doses of HPβCD diclofenac provided significant analgesic efficacy, as compared to placebo. Significant analgesic efficacy was also provided by the active comparator ketorolac. Both HPβCD diclofenac and ketorolac significantly reduced the need for opioids.

### Diclofenac sodium (diclofenac sodium delayed release) [^115M5AXv]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use diclofenac. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS; Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation).

After observing the response to initial therapy with diclofenac, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.

For the relief of osteoarthritis, the recommended dosage is 100–150 mg/day in divided doses (50 mg twice a day or three times a day, or 75 mg twice a day).

For the relief of rheumatoid arthritis, the recommended dosage is 150–200 mg/day in divided doses (50 mg three times a day. or four times a day, or 75 mg twice a day.).

For the relief of ankylosing spondylitis, the recommended dosage is 100–125 mg/day, administered as 25 mg four times a day, with an extra 25-mg dose at bedtime if necessary.

### Postoperative opioid sparing with injectable hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin-diclofenac: pooled analysis of data from two phase III clinical trials [^1176NxmX]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Opioids exert their analgesic effects by opioid receptors and are commonly used to manage postoperative pain either alone or in combination with other analgesics.–In the postoperative setting, opioid use can be accompanied by adverse events (AEs) such as postoperative nausea and vomiting, bladder dysfunction, drowsiness, sedation, and constipation, which can delay recovery and discharge.–Opioid use can also lead to acute tolerance, increased costs of care, and increased morbidity.–In addition to concerns in the general surgical patient population, specific patient groups, such as the elderly, may be particularly sensitive to the effects of opioids and more susceptible to risks of opioid-related AEs.

Alternatively, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) exert analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by cyclooxygenase inhibitionand represent a key aspect of multimodal postoperative analgesia, the goal of which is to provide appropriate analgesia while minimizing the AEs associated with given drug classes.–A growing body of data supports the ability of multimodal analgesia regimens to reduce postoperative opioid consumption and, therefore, the incidence of opioid-related AEs that can slow postoperative recovery.

Diclofenac is a nonselective NSAID with an established efficacy and tolerability profile that is available in multiple formulations and is used to treat acute and chronic pain. Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD)-diclofenac (Dyloject ™) is an injectable formulation of diclofenac sodium that is solubilized with HPβCD, does not require dilution, and is administered intravenously (IV) as a low-volume bolus injection. In contrast, a previous formulation of diclofenac for IV administration (Voltarol ™ [Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Surrey UK]; formulated with propylene glycol and benzyl alcohol) requires dilution and infusion over a period of 30–120 minutes. Previous studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of single- and multiple-dose HPβCD-diclofenac in postsurgical patients,–and HPβCD-diclofenac is indicated for the management of mild to moderate pain and moderate to severe pain, alone or in combination with opioid analgesics.

### Self-administered subcutaneous diclofenac sodium in acute migraine attack: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-finding pilot study [^115A2Cpj]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

A novel formulation of diclofenac, complexed with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) as a solubility enhancer, in a prefilled syringe for self-administered subcutaneous injection may overcome the limitations of acute migraine treatments administered by oral, rectal, intramuscular, or intravenous routes.

Methods

This multicentre, phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding pilot study evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of three different doses (25/50/75mg/1mL) of subcutaneous diclofenac sodium in the treatment of an acute migraine attack in 122 subjects. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients pain-free at 2 hours after the study drug injection.

Results

A significantly higher percentage of patients in the 50mg diclofenac group 14 (46.7%) were pain-free at 2 hours when compared with placebo: 9 (29.0%) (p = 0.01). The 50mg dose proved superior to placebo also in the majority of the secondary endpoints. The overall global impression favoured diclofenac vs placebo. There were no adverse events leading to study withdrawal. The majority of treatment-emergent adverse events were mild.

Conclusions

The 50mg dose of this novel formulation of diclofenac represents a valuable self-administered option for the acute treatment of migraine attacks. Trial registration: EudraCT Registration No. 2017–004828–29.

### Postoperative opioid sparing with injectable hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin-diclofenac: pooled analysis of data from two phase III clinical trials [^111Ab1AQ]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The goal of postoperative analgesia is to optimally manage pain while minimizing the potential for adverse effects that can delay recovery or present risks to the patient. While opioids are efficacious analgesics, AEs associated with this drug class can be wide ranging and represent an important concern for clinicians and patients. Furthermore, opioid-related AEs in postsurgical patients are associated with increased hospital length of stay and added costs which recent studies have estimated to range from $4,707 to $13,737 per patient. Thus, multimodal pain management approaches that make use of analgesics with different mechanisms of action, such as the NSAIDs, are recommended.

The results of this analysis of data from two Phase III trials reveal that repeated-dose HPβCD-diclofenac was associated with a significant opioid-sparing effect when given for up to 5 days for moderate to severe pain following abdominal/pelvic or orthopedic surgery. In addition, HPβCD-diclofenac (37.5 mg dose groups and all dose groups combined) demonstrated significant opioid-sparing effects in comparison to the active comparator ketorolac, a drug currently used in clinical practice, with respect to both cumulative rescue opioid dose and the number of doses. There were no discernible differences in baseline pain level (moderate, severe) between comparator groups, suggesting that the observed differences are not likely due to differences in baseline pain. Notably, opioid consumption appeared to be lowest in the HPβCD-diclofenac 37.5 mg group. While potential reasons for this were not investigated, it is noteworthy that 37.5 mg is the standard HPβCD-diclofenac dose and was given to patients without defined risk factors, while the 50 mg dose was given to patients weighing ≥ 95 kg. The results of this analysis expand upon previously reported data from the individual studies, which showed that HPβCD-diclofenac was associated with increased time to rescue opioid administration and reduced opioid consumption over 72 hours versus placebo in abdominal/pelvic surgery patients, as well as increased time to rescue opioid administration and reduced opioid consumption over 120 hours versus placebo in orthopedic surgery patients.

### Meeting acute migraine treatment needs through novel treatment formulations [^117Y6zPz]. Neurotherapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Migraineurs often do not use acute migraine-specific medications. Patient-reported satisfaction with triptans is modest. Patients are generally interested in obtaining more rapid and complete symptom relief. The role of trigeminal vascular activation may explain why some patients fail to respond to current treatment. Novel formulations of currently available acute migraine treatments have been developed, with improved clinical outcomes, response times, and pain-free rates. Currently available effective, novel, acute migraine therapies include needle-free injectable sumatriptan and effervescent diclofenac. Orally inhaled dihydroergotamine is a new treatment modality. These novel formulations may help patients achieve desirable outcomes, including faster and more complete relief, more consistent response, and improved drug tolerability.

### Skin necrosis after self-administered intramuscular diclofenac [^113TdS79]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Intramuscular diclofenac is used extensively for pain relief in medical practice. Tissue necrosis is a rare but serious complication of intramuscular injections. The pathogenetic mechanism is still not completely understood. A case of tissue necrosis following self-administration of diclofenac inadvertently injected into an arterial perforator branch of the superficial femoral artery is reported, supporting a vascular pathogenesis.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION SECTION

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use diclofenac. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).

After observing the response to initial therapy with diclofenac, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.

For the relief of osteoarthritis, the recommended dosage is 100 to 150 mg/day in divided doses (50 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d., or 75 mg b.i.d.).

For the relief of rheumatoid arthritis, the recommended dosage is 150 to 200 mg/day in divided doses (50 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d., or 75 mg b.i.d.).

For the relief of ankylosing spondylitis, the recommended dosage is 100 to 125 mg/day, administered as 25 mg q.i.d., with an extra 25-mg dose at bedtime if necessary.

Different formulations of diclofenac (diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets; diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets; diclofenac potassium immediate-release tablets) are not necessarily bioequivalent even if the milligram strength is the same.

### Effects of injectable HP β CD-diclofenac on the human delayed rectifier potassium channel current in vitro and on proarrhythmic QTc in vivo [^114P4DRR]. Clinical Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Novel formulations and administration routes of established drugs may result in higher maximum concentrations or total exposures and potentially cause previously unrecognized adverse events.

Objective

This study evaluated the proarrhythmic potential of hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD)-diclofenac, a novel injectable diclofenac formulation solubilized with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD), on ventricular electrical conduction in preclinical and clinical models.

Methods

We assessed the effects of diclofenac, HPβCD, and HPβCD-diclofenac on the human delayed rectifier potassium channel (IKr) using human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells transfected with a human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) using whole-cell patch-clamp. In a single-dose, active- and placebo-controlled, 4-period crossover, thorough QT in vivo study, 70 healthy volunteers (mean age, 23.3 years; range, 18–49 years; 55.75% male) received HPβCD-diclofenac at 37.5- and 75-mg doses, inactive vehicle (placebo), and an active control (moxifloxacin).

Results

In vitro, diclofenac produced no statistically significant effect on IKr. Significant, non-dose-dependent effects were observed in the presence of HPβCD or HPβCD-diclofenac of similar magnitude across the 300-fold dose range of concentrations tested, suggesting an artifact due to the detergent effect of HPβCD in this in vitro model. In vivo, neither HPβCD-diclofenac dose resulted in QTc prolongation ≥ 2 ms (≥ 5 ms is the threshold of clinical concern). No correlation was evident between changes in QTc and plasma concentrations of diclofenac or HPβCD. Confirming study sensitivity, moxifloxacin produced a mean QTc prolongation > 10 ms.

Conclusions

The findings from the present study suggest that HPβCD-diclofenac does not have a dose-dependent effect in the in vitro hERG assay system and does not produce proarrhythmic QTc prolongation in vivo. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01812538.

### Can we improve the existing management of pain after cesarean delivery at Eastern regional referral hospital? A retrospective study [^111sPpC6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

We analyzed a total of 107 CDs. Their mean age was 28 years, with a minimum age of 14 years and a maximum age of 42 years. In our study, we noted that only 2% of CDs had received pre-operative analgesia. Once inside the operating room, only 20% of patients were given intra-operative analgesia. Injectable paracetamol was the preferred choice for intra-operative analgesia.

As shown in Table 1, for an immediate post-operative period in the ward, the most common injectable analgesic used was a single injection of diclofenac sodium (63%), followed by a combination of diclofenac sodium and pethidine (11%).

Table 1
Injectable analgesic used at ward for immediate post-operative period after CD

Among oral analgesics, the most common choice was single drug ibuprofen (56%), which was mostly given at postoperative day 1, followed by the combination of ibuprofen and paracetamol (29%). On the day of discharge from the hospital, patients were sent home with either oral paracetamol (35%) or ibuprofen (57%). The study also revealed that 9% of patients were discharged without any kind of oral analgesic (Table 2). The patients were discharged from the hospital with the average length of oral analgesics of 3.36 days. On the availability of analgesics, we found that morphine and fentanyl were not available for 17% of patients. However, all other group of analgesics were available for all patients throughout the study duration.

### Dyloject, a novel injectable diclofenac formulation, offers greater safety and efficacy than voltarol for postoperative dental pain [^113W6WmG]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Voltarol for injection (a diclofenac sodium formulation employing polyethylene glycol and benzyl alcohol [PG-BA] as excipients) is marketed in Europe but not in North America. A suspension, PG-BA diclofenac sodium, requires preparation for each patient and slow IV infusion to minimize venous irritation. Dyloject, a novel diclofenac formulation, employs hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin (HPbetaCD) to solubilize diclofenac in a small volume. We compared the efficacy and safety of an IV HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium bolus, a 30-minute PG-BA diclofenac sodium infusion, and placebo in post-molar extraction pain.

Methods

A total of 155 adult patients were randomized to receive HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium 75 mg, PG-BA diclofenac sodium 75 mg, or placebo. Primary endpoints were superiority of HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium to placebo and noninferiority of HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium to PG-BA diclofenac sodium with respect to total pain relief over 4 hours (TOTPAR4) on a 0 to 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary endpoints included categorical TOTPAR4, VAS and categorical TOTPAR up to 8 hours, other measures of pain intensity and relief, patient global evaluation, and time to rescue medication.

Results

HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium had efficacy superior to both placebo and PG-BA diclofenac sodium. At 15 minutes, more patients given HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium than PG-BA diclofenac sodium reported 30% reduction in pain intensity (52% vs. 21%, P = .0022). Both diclofenac products had a 6-hour duration of effect and were well tolerated. Patient global evaluations of HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium were high, superior to placebo, and similar to PG-BA diclofenac sodium. The adverse event (AE) incidence was similar for HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium and PG-BA diclofenac sodium, except that in the current trial and in integrated safety results from the present and prior studies, phlebitis was more common with PG-BA diclofenac sodium. No cardiac or renal AEs or gastrointestinal bleeding were reported or observed.

Conclusions

IV bolus HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium produced analgesia more quickly than, and with equal duration as, the 30-minute PG-BA diclofenac sodium infusion. Pooled data on thrombophlebitis from the present investigation and our prior studies of the novel formulation indicate this adverse effect is less frequent and less severe with HPbetaCD diclofenac sodium than with PG-BA diclofenac sodium.

Discussions

Globally, maternal wellbeing and childbirth are the top priorities of physicians managing CDs. Even in Bhutan, undoubtedly, every effort is made for the safe delivery of a child with minimal pain and suffering. Many countries have reviewed and updated their protocols and guidelines for the management of analgesia after CD. However, the choices of analgesic modalities chosen by physicians in ERRH do not, in many cases, meet the standards of pain management practices. The current practices are mostly old, outdated, and often inconsistent. Although many studies have demonstrated sufficient evidence of the benefits of preventive analgesia for CD, in this study, only 2% of participants benefited from preventive analgesia. This low level of practice may be because treating physicians are unaware of the benefits of starting pre-operative analgesia. Multi-modal analgesia is the recommended modality for pain management. However, this study revealed that despite the availability of analgesics and skills, intra-operatively, only a single class of drug, either injectable paracetamol or diclofenac sodium, was administered. Another technique that our hospital can easily employ is the addition of a low dose of intrathecal morphine or α-2 agonists. Although α-2 agonists were not available in Bhutan, the addition of intrathecal morphine has been widely used and has reported promising results. The complication rate, which most of us fear, is negligible with a dose less than 300 mcg. Even as adjuvants to local anesthetic, it delays the time for first rescue analgesia and prolongs the duration of sensory block. Other alternative approaches could include infiltration of local anesthetic drug around the incision line and a transverses abdominis plain block. These two techniques were not employed to any of the participants of this study. In our hospital, the preferred analgesic for immediate post-operative period after CD was an intramuscular injection of diclofenac sodium (63%), which was usually given only when patient complained of pain. Elsewhere, the medication timing as-and-when mode is less advocated because it does not provide continuous pain control. Additionally, intramuscular route of administering diclofenac sodium makes it even less preferable as the injection is painful. This was, therefore, a suboptimal modality of pain control, especially when we had other more effective analgesics in the hospital.

### Sustained-release diclofenac conjugated to hyaluronate (diclofenac etalhyaluronate) for knee osteoarthritis: a randomized phase 2 study [^115TmUNR]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Knee OA is the most common chronic and progressive joint disorder associated with ageing and is a leading cause of disability in advanced-age people. Worldwide, ∼250 million people have OA, including OA of the knee. Major problems associated with OA are pain and loss of joint function caused by degeneration and destruction of the joint structure, including the articular cartilage, which leads to impaired health-related quality of life and activities of daily living. Management of knee OA before surgery includes non-pharmacological and pharmacological therapies. Non-pharmacological therapies such as education, exercise programmes, taping and dietary weight management are recommended and used alone or along with pharmacological therapies. Pharmacological approaches to relieve pain and improve function in patients with knee OA commonly involve oral or topical administration of NSAIDs or selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors as well as IA injection of CS (generally glucocorticoids) and HA. Although various pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies including physical therapy exist for knee OA, their expected strength or onset of efficacy are different. Recently, a randomized clinical trial demonstrated that patients with knee OA who underwent physical therapy had less pain and functional disability at 1 year than those who received IA glucocorticoid injection. In addition, because patient characteristics and complications need to be considered, it is recommended that an appropriate therapy be selected by relevant medical providers in accordance with the patient's medical status and/or preferences.

### Postoperative opioid sparing with injectable hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin-diclofenac: pooled analysis of data from two phase III clinical trials [^116ey5ZS]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Assessments of opioid use

In both studies, rescue medication (IV morphine, bolus, maximum 7.5 mg every 3 hours) was made available upon patient request any time after the initial dose of study drug was given. However, patients were encouraged to wait for at least 30 minutes after study drug administration in the orthopedic surgery study and at least 1 hour after study drug administration in the abdominal/pelvic surgery study to request for opioids. Patients in the abdominal/pelvic surgery study received a 5 mg IV bolus of morphine upon request, followed by titration to 7.5 mg, every 3 hours if needed. Patients in the orthopedic surgery study received IV bolus morphine in 2.5 mg increments, up to 7.5 mg, every 3 hours. Though encouraged to wait, patients were not denied rescue opioids in the event of requests made prior to 30 minutes (orthopedic surgery) or 1 hour (abdominal/pelvic surgery) after the first study drug dose was given. If the rescue opioids did not provide adequate analgesia, the patient was withdrawn from the study and given pain medication in accordance with the investigator's usual practice. Opioid use was recorded throughout the treatment period (from the time of first study drug administration to up to 120 hours [5 days] following first administration). The outcomes examined in this pooled analysis were: 1) proportion of patients requiring opioids; 2) cumulative opioid dose for the 0–24, 0–48, 0–72, 0–96, and 0–120 hour intervals following first study drug administration; and 3) cumulative number of opioid doses received for the 0–24, 0–48, 0–72, 0–96, and 0–120 hour intervals following first study drug administration. Comparisons were made between patients receiving either active treatment (HPβCD-diclofenac, ketorolac) and placebo, as well as between patients receiving either active treatment.

Patients

Patients were screened for study inclusion if they were scheduled for an abdominal/pelvic or orthopedic procedure within 2 weeks (abdominal/pelvic) or 3 weeks (orthopedic) and were expected to require IV analgesia for postoperative pain. Key inclusion criteria for both studies were: age ≥ 18 years and moderate to severe pain ≤ 6 hours following surgery (pain intensity ≥ 50 mm on a 0–100 mm visual analog scale [VAS]). The upper age limit was 65 years in the abdominal/pelvic surgery study and 85 years in the orthopedic surgery study. Females of childbearing age were required to have a negative pregnancy test at screening, as well as to be practicing abstinence or an approved method of contraception. Key exclusion criteria were: a history of uncontrolled chronic disease; recent history (≤ 6 months) of cardiovascular events (eg, myocardial infarction, stroke); known allergy to diclofenac, NSAIDs, morphine, anesthetics, or excipients of the study preparation; clinically significant lab or electrocardiograph (ECG) results at baseline or screening; use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tryptophan, carbamazepine, or valproate ≤ 2 weeks prior to taking study drug; use of aspirin (except for antiplatelet cardiac protection), other NSAIDs, or other common centrally or peripherally acting analgesic drugs, centrally acting adjuvants, major and minor tranquilizers, or antihistamines ≤ 24 hours prior to study drug administration (with the exception of medications administered during the procedure); and use of a long-acting NSAID or cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor ≤ 3 days prior to surgery. Patient-controlled analgesia was not permitted postoperatively, either prior to or during drug dosing.

### Cardiovascular safety of hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin-diclofenac in the management of acute postsurgical pain: a pooled analysis of 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-and active comparator-controlled phase III clinical trials [^113TfE5k]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including selective and nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors, has been suggested to be associated with cardiovascular (CV) safety risks. Data are limited regarding CV risks associated with short-term nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, including injectable formulations, although it has been suggested that even a single dose may increase CV adverse event (AE) risk. The objective of this study was to examine the CV safety of an injectable diclofenac formulation solubilized with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) when given for ≤ 5days postoperatively.

Design

A pooled analysis of CV AEs from 2 pivotal phase III clinical trials examining the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) HPβCD-diclofenac vs placebo and the active comparator ketorolac was conducted.

Setting

Postoperative, with treatment initiated in the postanesthesia care unit ≤ 6hours postsurgery.

Patients

Overall, 608 abdominal/pelvic and orthopedic surgery patients met inclusion criteria and received ≥ 1 study medication dose.

Interventions

Patients received either HPβCD-diclofenac, ketorolac, or placebo via IV bolus injection every 6hours, for ≤ 5days postsurgery.

Measurements

CV AEs, reported by study investigators, were evaluated through the treatment period and follow-up (≤ 37days after last study medication dose), and relative CV AE risks were estimated.

Main Results

IV HPβCD-diclofenac was not associated with increased treatment-emergent CV AE incidence vs placebo (11.6% vs 12.2%; relative risk, 0.96 [95% confidence interval, 0.56–1.62]). Serious CV AEs as well as treatment-related AEs were uncommon, and there were no reports of myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident. CV AEs were uncommon during the follow-up period, occurring in 1.3%, 0%, and 1.4% of patients in the HPβCD-diclofenac, ketorolac, and placebo groups, respectively.

Conclusions

Although a longer duration follow-up study in a larger patient population would expand our understanding of potential CV risks, the present analysis suggests that postoperative use of HPβCD-diclofenac does not present an added CV safety risk over placebo.

### Single-dose intravenous diclofenac for acute postoperative pain in adults [^11414CXp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduces patient opioid requirements and, in turn, reduces the incidence and severity of opioid-induced adverse events (AEs).

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of single-dose intravenous diclofenac, compared with placebo or an active comparator, for moderate to severe postoperative pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases without language restrictions: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Register of Studies Online), MEDLINE, and Embase on 22 May 2018. We checked clinical trials registers and reference lists of retrieved articles for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized trials that compared a single postoperative dose of intravenous diclofenac with placebo or another active treatment, for treating acute postoperative pain in adults following any surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently considered trials for review inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. Our primary outcome was the number of participants in each arm achieving at least 50% pain relief over a four- and six-hour period. Our secondary outcomes were time to, and number of participants using rescue medication; withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, AEs, and for any cause; and number of participants experiencing any AE, serious AEs (SAEs), and NSAID-related AEs. We performed a post hoc analysis of opioid-related AEs, to enable indirect comparisons with other analyses of postoperative analgesics. For subgroup analysis, we planned to analyze different doses and formulations of parenteral diclofenac separately. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome using GRADE and created two 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included eight studies, involving 1756 participants undergoing various surgeries (dental, mixed minor, abdominal, and orthopedic), with 20 to 175 participants receiving intravenous diclofenac in each study. Mean study population ages ranged from 24.5 years to 54.5 years. Intravenous diclofenac doses varied among and within studies, ranging from 3.75 mg to 75 mg. Five studies assessed newer formulations of parenteral diclofenac that could be administered as an undiluted intravenous bolus. Most studies had an unclear risk of bias for several domains and a high risk of bias due to small sample size. The overall quality of evidence for each outcome was generally low for reasons including unclear risk of bias in studies, imprecision, and low event numbers. Primary outcomeThree studies (277 participants) produced a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) for at least 50% of maximum pain relief versus placebo of 2.4 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9 to 3.1) over four hours (low-quality evidence). Four studies (436 participants) produced an NNTB of 3.8 versus placebo (95% CI 2.9 to 5.9) over six hours (low-quality evidence). No studies provided data for the comparison of intravenous diclofenac with another NSAID over four hours. At six hours there was no difference between intravenous diclofenac and another NSAID (low-quality evidence). Secondary outcomesFor secondary efficacy outcomes, intravenous diclofenac was generally superior to placebo and similar to other NSAIDs. For time to rescue medication, comparison of intravenous diclofenac versus placebo demonstrated a median of 226 minutes for diclofenac versus 80 minutes for placebo (5 studies, 542 participants, low-quality evidence). There were insufficient data for pooled analysis for comparisons of diclofenac with another NSAID (very low-quality evidence). For the number of participants using rescue medication, two studies (235 participants) compared diclofenac with placebo. The number needed to treat to prevent one additional harmful event (NNTp) (here, the need for rescue medication) compared with placebo was 3.0 (2.2 to 4.5, low-quality evidence). The comparison of diclofenac with another NSAID included only one study (98 participants). The NNTp was 4.5 (2.5 to 33) for ketorolac versus diclofenac (very low-quality evidence). The numbers of participants withdrawing were generally low and inconsistently reported (very low-quality evidence). Participant withdrawals were: 6% (8/140) diclofenac versus 5% (7/128) placebo, and 9% (8/87) diclofenac versus 7% (6/82) another NSAID for lack of efficacy; 2% (4/211) diclofenac versus 0% (0/198) placebo, and 3% (4/138) diclofenac versus 2% (2/129) another NSAID due to AEs; and 11% (21/191) diclofenac versus 17% (30/179) placebo, and 18% (21/118) diclofenac versus 15% (17/111) another NSAID for any cause. Overall adverse event rates were similar between intravenous diclofenac and placebo (71% in both groups, 2 studies, 296 participants) and between intravenous diclofenac and another NSAID (55% and 58%, respectively, 2 studies, 265 participants) (low-quality evidence for both comparisons). Serious and specific AEs were rare, preventing meta-analysis. There were sufficient data for a dose-effect analysis for our primary outcome for only one alternative dose, 18.75 mg. Analysis of the highest dose employed in each study demonstrated a relative benefit compared with placebo of 1.9 (1.4 to 2.4), whereas for the group receiving 18.75 mg, the relative benefit versus placebo was 1.6 (1.2 to 2.1, 2 studies). Compared to another NSAID, the high-dose analysis demonstrated a relative benefit of 0.9 (0.8 to 1.1), for the group receiving 18.75 mg, the relative benefit was 0.78 (0.65 to 0.93). For direct comparison of high dose versus 18.75 mg, the proportion of participants with at least 50% pain relief was 66% (90/137) for the high-dose arm versus 57% (77/135) in the low-dose arm. There were insufficient data for subgroup meta-analysis of different diclofenac formulations.

Authors' Conclusions

The amount and quality of evidence for the use of intravenous diclofenac as a treatment for postoperative pain is low. The available evidence indicates that postoperative intravenous diclofenac administration offers good pain relief for the majority of patients, but further research may impact this estimate. Adverse events appear to occur at a similar rate to other NSAIDs. Insufficient information is available to assess whether intravenous diclofenac has a different rate of bleeding, renal dysfunction, or cardiovascular events versus other NSAIDs. There was insufficient information to evaluate the efficacy and safety of newer versus traditional formulations of intravenous diclofenac. There was a lack of studies in major and cardiovascular surgeries and in elderly populations, which may be at increased risk for adverse events.

### Topical analgesics: pharmacology and clinical applications [^116CjZuL]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Technological Improvements of Topical Analgesic Delivery

As we have discussed, a fraction of the administered dose of topical analgesics can be absorbed into the systemic circulation, potentially increasing the risk of adverse effects that topical application aims to avoid. Although systemic concentrations are typically low, it is essential to optimize the application of topical drugs. This ensures effective penetration through the stratum corneum while maintaining localized action and minimizing entry into the bloodstream. There are several technological improvements that may help to improve skin penetration. These include nanocarriers, such as liposomes, nanoemulsions, and lipid nanoparticles, but also other carriers, such as microsponges, ionic liquids, and deep eutectic solvents. They can be combined with active application modes, such as radiation or microneedle injections. These innovative formulation strategies may improve drug transport and pharmacokinetics of topical analgesics.

For instance, a diclofenac microemulsion was tested in a small prospective observational study with 11 patients, of whom 9 reported at least a 50% reduction in pain on a visual analog scale. While these results are promising, the small cohort size limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions about the efficacy of the diclofenac microemulsion.

Despite their potential, these technological advancements also have certain disadvantages, including high material and production costs as well as the risk of potential toxicity. Additionally, delivery and targeted release of large molecules, such as peptides and proteins without systemic uptake, remain a challenge with these methods. In the context of personalized medicine, it may also be necessary to tailor delivery strategies and doses to the patient's specific skin type and unique requirements.

In summary, numerous novel and promising topical drug delivery systems have been developed that could be useful for the delivery of analgesics. However, further research is needed to establish their efficacy and safety.

Pain management is a complex process that requires careful selection of analgesics and their routes of administration to address both acute and chronic conditions effectively. Topical analgesics offer promising alternatives to oral medications for acute, inflammatory, and neuropathic pain, particularly for patients with gastrointestinal issues or those at risk of systemic side effects. Further research into innovative delivery systems is crucial to optimize their use and to improve safety and efficacy.

Consensus Points for NSAIDs

NSAIDs are an effective treatment for mild-to-moderate pain secondary to osteoarthritis knee pain; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
Topical NSAIDs are recommended before oral treatments because of their lower systemic exposure/toxicity; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
Topical diclofenac 70–81 mg/day should be considered as first-line pharmacological treatment for knee OA - can be effective and generally safer than oral NSAIDs due to reduced systemic exposure and lower dose; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
NSAIDs should not be used for patients with comorbidities due to risk of adverse events; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
NSAIDs should not be used on a long-term basis (> 3 months) due to side effect profile (cardiovascular and gastrointestinal) and lack safety data; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
Celecoxib and non-selective NSAIDs are as effective as opioid for knee OA; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
Due to low effect on pain and physical function, regardless of dose, the potential clinical benefit of opioids does not outweigh the potential harm in patients with knee OA; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong

### Efficacy and safety of diclofenac-hyaluronate conjugate (diclofenac etalhyaluronate) for knee osteoarthritis: a randomized phase III trial in Japan [^114Hi3JM]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Although IA injection of glucocorticoids or HA is used for the conservative treatment of knee OA, these agents are a subject of controversy. IA glucocorticoids should be used for short‐term pain relief because of their short‐lived efficacy and safety issues. The benefits of HA have been reported in multiple studies, although there is conflicting data. Clinical and nonclinical reports suggest that IA HA has antiinflammatory and analgesic effects, suppresses joint cartilage degeneration, and normalizes synovial fluid. HA also functions as a lubricant due to its viscoelasticity. Nevertheless, treatment of knee OA with IA HA has not yet been established, and most guidelines do not currently recommend the use of IA HA based on poor evidence of its benefits.

In pursuit of OA treatments, Seikagaku Corporation developed a novel compound, diclofenac etalhyaluronate (DF‐HA; ONO‐5704/SI‐613), which is DF covalently linked to HA. It is a high molecular weight fermented HA (600–1,200 kd) combining the purported advantages of IA HA injection and NSAIDs: antiinflammatory and analgesic effects, suppression of joint cartilage degeneration, and normalization of synovial fluid function. Compared with oral DF therapy, IA injection of DF‐HA is thought to reduce systemic exposure to DF because the amount of DF released from DF‐HA is ~3.5 mg/dose. Indeed, in rabbits with antigen‐induced arthritis, systemic exposure to DF was much lower after a single effective IA dose of DF‐HA than after a single effective oral dose of diclofenac sodium. Furthermore, the sustained release of DF from DF‐HA after 1 injection into the joint tissue has potential analgesic effects lasting up to 28 days. The efficacy and safety of DF‐HA in patients with knee OA was confirmed in a previous trial, in which patients who received a total of 3 injections of DF‐HA, one every 4 weeks for 12 weeks, showed significant improvements in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index 3.1 (WOMAC) pain subscale score compared to patients who received placebo, with no major safety concerns.

Novel delivery mechanisms

Topical and oral NSAIDs are established OA analgesic therapies. AMZ001 is a novel, longer-acting, topical 3.06% diclofenac gel requiring fewer daily applications than the standard topical NSAID regime (four times a day). This was assessed in a phase 2 trial that randomized 444 knee OA participants to receive AMZ001 once daily, AMZ001 twice daily, placebo twice daily or diclofenac 1% gel four times daily. AMZ001 once daily improved WOMAC pain vs placebo at week 4 (primary outcome), but the twice daily regimen and diclofenac 1% failed. The lack of a dose response limits the evidence that either of the AMZ001 regimens are more effective than placebo. Diclofenac in a novel topical liposomal gel (lipogel) improved pain compared with placebo in a recent small study.

An alternative delivery of topical NSAIDs is via medicated plasters. Early NSAID plasters used methyl salicylate, but indomethacin plasters have also been developed. In a crossover trial of 168 participants with knee OA, both methyl-salicylate and indomethacin plasters significantly improved Japanese Knee Osteoarthritis Measure scores (measuring pain, stiffness and function) over placebo, though no significant difference between the two active comparators were found. The potential indication of IA NSAIDs would be to limit systemic toxicity, and a non-placebo randomized trial, reported that an IA preparation of NSAID ketorolac had comparable efficacy in improving pain and function to that of IA triamcinolone in treating hip and knee OA.

IA CSs is an established knee OA treatment, though analgesic benefits are short-lived. Longer-acting preparations could therefore provide prolonged benefits, although cost implications need to be considered. FX006 is a long-acting triamcinolone acetonide extended-release (TA-ER) drug developed using microsphere technology, prolonging its presence in the joint. A phase 3 study randomized 484 participants to TA-ER 32 mg, immediate-release triamcinolone 40 mg or placebo. The study showed a significant improvement in average-daily-pain intensity compared with placebo at 12 weeks (primary end point). IA TA-ER 32 mg is licensed by the FDA for knee OA. Bilateral TA-ER injections are also associated with relatively lower systemic concentrations compared with triamcinolone crystalline suspension.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Pharmacodynamics

Diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities in animal models. The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition.

Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

Diclofenac is 100% absorbed after oral administration compared to IV administration as measured by urine recovery. However, due to first-pass metabolism, only about 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available (see Table 1). Food has no significant effect on the extent of diclofenac absorption. However, there is usually a delay in the onset of absorption of 1 to 4.5 hours and a reduction in peak plasma levels of < 20%.

Distribution

The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of diclofenac sodium is 1.4 L/kg.

Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to albumin. Serum protein binding is constant over the concentration range (0.15–105 μg/mL) achieved with recommended doses.

Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into the joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid, after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than plasma levels. It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in the effectiveness of diclofenac.

2.1 Important Dosage Information

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].
After observing the response to initial therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.
Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended for patients who would not receive the appropriate dosage of both active ingredients.
Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, fixed combination products, are administered as

Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg (50 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol) or

Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg (75 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol).

2.2 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Osteoarthritis

The recommended dosage for the treatment of osteoarthritis for maximal GI mucosal protection is diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg three times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/200 mcg two times a day or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/200 mcg two times a day can be used, but these dosages are less effective in preventing ulcers.

### Anaphylaxis after intramuscular injection of diclofenac sodium [^117DF9Dy]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Diclofenac sodium is a 2-arylacetic acid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. It is widely used in pain management. Side effects such as urticaria, asthmatic attack, vasospastic angina, ischemic stroke, and Kounis syndrome may be seen after the use of diclofenac sodium. However, anaphylactic shock is rare. Anaphylactic shock secondary to injection of diclofenac sodium can be treated successfully with intramuscular injection of adrenaline. Because diclofenac sodium is commonly used in analgesic treatment in emergency departments, we present this case report to emphasize that anaphylactic shock may be seen after the use of that drug.

DF‐HA also improved the quality of life and decreased the use of acetaminophen as outcomes for chronic pain. These results suggest that DF‐HA improves multiple symptoms including pain in knee OA. Of note, in the present study DF‐HA decreased WOMAC pain subscale scores from as early as week 1, and this level of decrease was maintained for 4 weeks. This effect was extended to 24 weeks by injection once every 4 weeks.

However, WOMAC pain subscale scores were decreased from baseline after each injection in both the DF‐HA and placebo groups, and there were many responders in the placebo group. These results may be explained by the placebo effect. The large placebo effects related to IA injection are likely to be caused by the invasiveness of the administrative procedure and the physiologic response to liquid injected into the articular cavity. In the present study, injections were administered frequently (6 times), which may have further increased the placebo effect. Indeed, a large placebo effect is always a concern in clinical trials using IA injection, and many trials in OA fail to show a significant difference between placebo and the study drug. In addition, the between‐group difference in WOMAC pain subscale scores was not significant at week 24, which may result from floor effects as well as large placebo effects. As described above, some benefits of DF‐HA were confirmed, but further studies are needed to evaluate their clinical importance.

### Sustained-release diclofenac conjugated to hyaluronate (diclofenac etalhyaluronate) for knee osteoarthritis: a randomized phase 2 study [^111mBvc6]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This clinical study is the first to report the efficacy and safety of multiple IA injections of DF-HA in patients with knee OA. Injection of DF-HA showed superior efficacy compared with placebo for relieving pain as indicated by primary outcome following three monthly treatments. The study included three primary outcome measures of pain severity: the WOMAC pain subscores, the 50-foot walk test pain score and the daily pain score derived from the patients' diaries. The WOMAC pain subscores, daily pain score and 50-foot walk test pain score were significantly decreased from baseline after the first injection in the placebo group as well as the DF-HA group. These decreases were thought to be placebo effects, because IA injection itself was reported to have a large placebo effect. The WOMAC pain subscores and daily pain score indicated that pain mitigation was significantly superior in the DF-HA group, and the 50-foot walk test pain score indicated a trend towards superior pain mitigation over 12 weeks after the first injection.

In this clinical study, a single IA injection of DF-HA showed significant early-onset efficacy and a long-lasting analgesic effect for 4 weeks comparable to that reported in animal models of OA. Significant improvement in the DF-HA group was observed at 1 week after the first injection. The onset of the effect of DF-HA seems to be much faster than that of unconjugated HA (5–13 weeks after injection). Furthermore, a trend towards superior improvement of pain by DF-HA was maintained from week 12 to week 24 following three monthly injections. Additionally, DF-HA showed a trend towards improved knee OA symptoms, including stiffness, physical function and pain. We speculate that the outcomes of this study resulted from the envisioned multiple mechanisms of action of DF-HA, which has the advantages of both DF and HA (i.e. anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, cartilage protection, and normalization of SF function).

### An integrated safety analysis of intravenous ibuprofen (caldolor (®)) in adults [^117BuoTs]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a well known and long history of use. Oral ibuprofen was approved in the United States over 40 years ago and has been a nonprescription drug for more than 30 years. IV ibuprofen (Caldolor ®, Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. Nashville, TN, USA) was first approved in 2009 for the management of mild to moderate pain, moderate to severe pain in conjunction with narcotics, and for the reduction of fever in adults. It is the only IV NSAID approved for the treatment of fever in the United States. Since 2002, the safety and effectiveness of IV ibuprofen has been investigated in ten clinical studies, Phases II–IV, conducted under a corporate investigational new drug application (Table 1).

Two other IV NSAIDs are currently available in the US market, ketorolac tromethamine injection ("ketorolac", Toradol, Pfizer Inc. New York, NY, USA) and diclofenac sodium injection ("diclofenac", Dyloject™, Hospira Inc. Lake Forest, IL, USA). Ketorolac injection was approved in 1989 for the short-term management of moderately severe, acute pain requiring analgesia at the opioid level. Ketorolac is contraindicated for use in excess of 5 days, for minor or chronic pain, and for use in pediatric patients. Additional limitations on ketorolac administration include prohibitions against all preoperative use, in patients with active ulcers or who are otherwise at a high risk of bleeding, those with advanced renal impairment, and women who are nursing. Diclofenac sodium injection was approved in December 2014 for the management of mild to moderate pain or moderate to severe pain either alone or in combination with opiates. Diclofenac is only approved for use in adults and is contraindicated in patients with known moderate to severe renal insufficiency who may become volume depleted. Neither of these IV NSAIDs are indicated for the treatment of fever.

### Steroid injection versus NSAID injection for trigger finger: a comparative study of early outcomes [^114RzDBK]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Stenosing tenosynovitis of the flexor tendon sheath of the digits of the hand results from a discrepancy between the diameter of the flexor tendon and its sheath at the A1 pulley. The treatment options for trigger digits include oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and local NSAID applications, splintage, steroid injection, and percutaneous and open release of the A1 pulley. Injectable NSAID is used intramuscularly and locally in other sites. The hypothesis is that an injectable NSAID is as effective as the traditionally used steroid injection in the treatment of trigger digit, based on Quinnell grading, and that the treatment works as well in patients with diabetes as in those without diabetes.

Methods

In this prospective, randomized, double-blinded controlled study for trigger digits, we injected diclofenac sodium locally in one group (NSAID group) and triamcinolone acetonide in another (corticosteroid group). A total of 100 patients (50 patients in each group) were followed up and assessed 3 weeks and 3 months after the injection.

Results

At the end of the follow-up, 35 patients (70%) in the corticosteroid group and 28 patients (53%) in the NSAID group had complete symptomatic resolution. There was no difference between the response of patients with and without diabetes. There was no significant difference found in Quinnell score between treatments at 3 months, although at 3 weeks, the patients who received steroid had significantly better Quinnell scores.

Conclusions

We concluded that, although steroids gave quicker relief, NSAID injections are equally effective at 3 months in the treatment of trigger digits. We were unable to detect a statistically significant difference in the response of patients with and without diabetes to either treatment.

### Diclofenac sodium (diclofenac sodium delayed release) [^113TuAHs]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Action

Diclofenac has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.

The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).

Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.

Absorption

Diclofenac is 100% absorbed after oral administration compared to IV administration as measured by urine recovery. However, due to first-pass metabolism, only about 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available (see Table 1). Food has no significant effect on the extent of diclofenac absorption. However, there is usually a delay in the onset of absorption of 1 to 4.5 hours and a reduction in peak plasma levels of < 20%.

Distribution

The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of diclofenac sodium is 1.4 L/kg.

Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to albumin. Serum protein binding is constant over the concentration range (0.15–105 mcg/ml) achieved with recommended doses.

Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into the joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid, after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than plasma levels. It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in the effectiveness of diclofenac.

### Importance of the formulation in the skin delivery of topical diclofenac: not all topical diclofenac formulations are the same [^111RcW73]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We observed that a product with a higher concentration of diclofenac does not necessarily lead to greater skin absorption relative to a product with lower concentration of the active ingredient but different characteristics.

Although our study was specific to topical diclofenac, the findings on the influence of the formulation could be applicable to other drugs. As such, these data support previous studies suggesting that development of a topical pain relief product should take into consideration parameters beyond drug concentration, such as formulation composition. As discussed, these critical parameters may influence the ability of a given NSAID to efficiently penetrate first through the stratum corneum and subsequently the lower layers of the skin to exert its local action at the level of soft tissues and/or joints.

### Efficacy and safety of diclofenac-hyaluronate conjugate (diclofenac etalhyaluronate) for knee osteoarthritis: a randomized phase III trial in Japan [^114DL9Dt]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Regarding safety, anaphylactic shock and anaphylactic reaction in 1 subject each were judged to be moderate and were resolved after pharmacotherapy. Because anaphylactic symptoms in response to DF‐HA may not be ruled out for clinical use, careful monitoring and immediate treatment with established anaphylaxis therapies will be required. No clinically important GI‐ or CV‐related TEAEs, which have been observed with oral NSAIDs and selective COX‐2 inhibitors, or clinically important renal dysfunction, were observed in the DF‐HA group. This promising safety profile may be related to the lower dose needed and reduced systemic exposure to DF that occurs when DF‐HA is administered via injection.

In a previous phase II study, joint inflammation at the injection site was observed in 1 subject. Therefore, we performed examination of the target knee to evaluate the safety of injection into the local joint. No clinical issues were revealed on target knee examination, demonstrating that AEs similar to those in the previous study did not occur in the present study despite the larger number of DF‐HA injections. No differences in the incidence of TEAEs at the injection site were observed between the treatment groups, whereas these local reactions have been reported for other HA preparations. Finally, no clinical issue was observed on radiography. Nevertheless, NSAIDs have been reported to be deleterious to joint cartilage. Although no particular concern was confirmed by the findings of this study, further studies are needed to determine the effects of DF‐HA on joint cartilage, since DF‐HA, after approval, would be the first IA preparation of NSAIDs to be injected into human knee cavities.

Some existing IA preparations are effective when injected once every 3 or 6 months. However, DF‐HA requires repeated injections every 4 weeks to maintain efficacy. This is a limitation of the practical use of DF‐HA. Furthermore, although not confirmed in this study, joint infection is a common risk of IA injection, and the risk is higher with more frequent administration compared with IA preparations administered once every 3 or 6 months. Given that serious safety issues caused by DF‐HA were confirmed in this study, it is necessary to compare the risk/benefit ratio with that of other IA preparations. In particular, a head‐to‐head study of DF‐HA versus an approved HA is required to determine whether there is a great enough benefit of DF‐HA to justify the monthly injection frequency versus the semiannual injection frequency of most HA preparations.

### Efficacy, tolerability, and safety of an oral enzyme combination vs diclofenac in osteoarthritis of the knee: results of an individual patient-level pooled reanalysis of data from six randomized controlled trials [^111R4TQQ]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

OA is a highly prevalent and restricting disease with significant potential to threaten quality of life. Pain and impairment of physical functioning are the key domains for the overall burden of suffering experienced by patients with OA of the knee. In addition to physical exercises and lifestyle changes, adequate symptomatic pharmacological management strategies have a beneficial and clinically relevant impact on pain, functional capability in daily life, and overall quality of life.–Although often pathophysiologically characterized as a primary degenerative disease with intermittent inflammatory flares, chronic low-grade inflammation seems to constitute an important aspect of OA pathology, requiring adequate and ongoing antiphlogistic treatments.NSAIDs are primarily effective in limiting OA-related pain by their capacity to impair inflammation and nociceptive activity through COX2 inhibition; however, they are limited by their potential to cause serious GI, cardiovascular, renal, and allergic side effects,–which altogether have evolved into the main life-threatening risk factors of the disease, especially in the elderly, a patient population risk of overall increased mortality. Due to this, current OA-treatment guidelines specifically recommend using these agents only at the lowest (effective) dose and to avoid long-term treatment whenever possible, de facto confining their use for the episodic treatment of transient OA flares. While these recommendations are comprehensible from a safety point of view, they disregard not only the aforementioned pathophysiological need for a prolonged antiphlogistic treatment to prevent OA progression but also patients' legitimate claims for treatments that are effective, safe, and well tolerated.

### Necrosis of the thumb after inadvertent injection of diclofenac in the radial artery: a case report [^1156gDja]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Inadvertent intra-arterial drug injection occurs rarely, but it can cause very serious clinical complications, and thus, awareness of inadvertent intra-arterial drug injection is needed. The complications mainly result from iatrogenic reasons and can occur because of vascular variations in the arteries, under circumstances where normal intravenous injection is difficult, or in drug abusers who perform self-injection. The adverse effect associated with intra-arterial drug injection is serious and may lead to necrosis, requiring amputation of the affected extremity, infection, pseudoaneurysm, rhabdomyolysis, compartment syndrome, and permanent disability. However, the etiology of such adverse effects has not been clearly identified and treatment methods have not yet been established. We encountered a patient who developed necrosis of the thumb after an inadvertent injection of diclofenac sodium in the radial artery due to variations in the forearm arteries. Here, we report the prevention and treatment of, and precautions against, the dangers of intra-arterial drug injection.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^116PpqFg]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

NSAIDs are among the most commonly prescribed and used medications worldwide. However, they are associated with safety and tolerability concerns. There are a number of factors that need to be considered in the selection of an NSAID, including its potency, selectivity for the COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms, pharmacokinetic properties, pharmacodynamic interactions, and the overall impact of these features on tolerability and safety. In addition to the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety of NSAIDs, the negative effects of inhibiting prostanoid production on other body systems should be considered. Emerging factors, including biomarkers, may assist clinicians in the selection of appropriate doses and types of NSAIDs. Finally, the individual's clinical background, particularly gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risk factors, should be considered as important determinants that may exacerbate adverse reactions to NSAIDs. The risk factors for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs are summarized in Table 1. NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for atherothrombotic events. The long-term use of higher doses of NSAIDs represents an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal adverse events;, therefore, the lowest dose of an NSAID should be used, particularly in patients with other known risk factors.

Current knowledge of factors affecting the safety and tolerability of NSAIDs, including the impact of selectivity, dose, and pharmacokinetics, is being used to guide the development of novel formulations of NSAIDs that address some of these tolerability concerns. For example, a novel immediate-release diclofenac formulation, which has a short half-life, acidic profile, and COX-2 selectivity, has been developed that allows for the use of lower doses (thus reducing systemic exposure and the potential for adverse events) together with rapid attainment of C max, providing sustained analgesia with a rapid onset. Strategies to mitigate the risks and maximize the therapeutic benefits associated with NSAIDs should continue to be employed, such as use of the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time, use of immediate-release formulations, avoidance of known drug interactions (eg, concomitant use with corticosteroids, low-dose aspirin, or other antiplatelet/anticoagulation events), and limited use of NSAIDs with high gastrointestinal toxicity. Additional strategies for minimizing the risks associated with NSAIDs in individuals with gastrointestinal and/or cardiovascular risk factors are summarized in Table 2.

### Are prescribers not aware of cardiovascular contraindications for diclofenac? A claims data analysis [^1134QUhn]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare diclofenac use before and after implementation of European risk minimization measures in 2013, focusing on diclofenac initiators and prevalence of congestive heart failure (NYHA class II-IV), ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease and cerebrovascular disease (new contraindications) in these patients in Germany.

Methods

We included adults with health insurance coverage on 1 January 2011 (cohort 2011) or 1 January 2014 (cohort 2014) and during a 1-year pre-observation period. We defined diclofenac initiators as persons filling a prescription of systemic diclofenac in 2011 (cohort 2011) or 2014 (cohort 2014) and without such a prescription during the respective pre-observation period.

Results

Each cohort comprised > 10 million persons. Between 2011 and 2014, the age-standardized proportion of persons initiating diclofenac decreased by 29% (from 8.2% to 5.8%) amongst female patients and by 26% (from 8.5% to 6.3%) amongst male patients; in the subgroup of persons with new contraindications, this proportion decreased by 33% (from 9.8% to 6.6%) amongst female patients and by 31% (from 10.0% to 6.7%) amongst male patients. Amongst diclofenac initiators, the proportion of those with new contraindications did not change between 2011 (12.0%) and 2014 (11.8%).

Conclusion

The overall decline of about 30% in diclofenac initiation between 2011 and 2014 was largely independent of the presence or absence of new contraindications. The proportion of diclofenac initiators with a new contraindication remained at a high level (more than one in ten patients), demonstrating the need for research at the prescriber level (e.g. interventional studies) and further measures to improve patient safety.

### Safety of a novel parenteral formulation of diclofenac after major orthopedic or abdominal / pelvic surgery in a population including anticoagulated, elderly or renally insufficient patients: an open-label, multiday, repeated dose clinical trial [^113nxCCV]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Decisions to use or avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for postsurgical pain are often influenced by concerns about bleeding and renal adverse effects. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of a novel parenteral NSAID, hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) diclofenac, in a large postsurgical patient population, with particular focus on bleeding and renal effects.

Methods

This was a large open-label study in adult patients with acute moderate-to-severe pain following major surgery. Patients received ≥ 2 days of continuous treatment with HPβCD diclofenac, administered as a small-volume bolus injection every 6 hours. Few exclusion criteria were applied in order to reflect surgical patient populations commonly managed in clinical practice. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the study. The incidences of bleeding- and renal-related AEs were examined in patient subpopulations with known risk factors for NSAID-induced complications: advanced age, pre-existing renal insufficiency, concomitant anticoagulant use, prolonged exposure, elevated dosage, and major surgeries.

Results

Of the total 971 patients studied, 38% were ≥ 65 years old (12% > 75 years), 62% received concomitant anticoagulants, and 6% had pre-existing renal insufficiency. HPβCD diclofenac was well tolerated by the patient population. AE rates are presented by risk factor to enable clinicians to better describe renal- or bleeding-related AEs.

Conclusions

In addition to its previously demonstrated efficacy, this study provides evidence of HPβCD diclofenac's safety in a large postsurgical population including anticoagulated, elderly or renally insufficient patients. Because study exclusion criteria were minimal, these findings may be broadly generalizable to populations commonly treated in clinical practice.

### Efficacy and safety of diclofenac-hyaluronate conjugate (diclofenac etalhyaluronate) for knee osteoarthritis: a randomized phase III trial in Japan [^112Hce1g]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Study design and characteristics of the subjects

A phase III multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial was performed at 50 sites in Japan. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Council for Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and was approved by the institutional review boards at the central boards or at each local site. All subjects provided written informed consent.

Eligible subjects were ages 40–75 years and had knee OA (not secondary OA caused by trauma or another disease) with a Kellgren/Lawrence (K/L) grade of 2 or 3 diagnosed radiographically, pain for at least 1 year in the target knee, and a WOMAC pain subscale score and pain score on the 50‐foot walking test of 50–90 mm (on a 100‐mm visual analog scale [VAS]) in the target knee and ≤ 30 mm in the contralateral knee at the time of screening. Patients with lower extremity pain caused by other diseases; inflammation, infection, skin disease, or systemic disease at the target knee; body mass index (BMI) ≥ 35.0 kg/m 2, which indicates a high risk of complications; hypersensitivity to DF, HA, or acetaminophen; aspirin‐induced asthma; surgical or invasive treatment within 1 year; or joint effusion removal within 7 days prior to screening were excluded.

Randomization and blinding

Subjects were allocated to receive either DF‐HA (30 mg/3 mL in a prefilled syringe; Seikagaku Corporation) or placebo (citric acid–sodium citrate buffered solution [3 mL in a prefilled syringe; Seikagaku Corporation]) at a 1:1 ratio, and randomization was performed using an interactive web response system. Balance between the treatment groups at each site was achieved using a minimization method. Groups were stratified by K/L grade, mean baseline WOMAC pain subscale score, and sex.

Both treatments were clear, colorless, and identical in appearance; however, the force needed to inject them differed because DF‐HA has a greater viscosity. To maintain blinding, an investigator other than the one who administered the injection performed all postinjection evaluations. Moreover, the investigator who administered the injection was prohibited from divulging information about the treatment to the investigators conducting the assessments or the subjects.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^115w1KEY]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

VA/DoD hip & knee osteoarthritis — topical NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) efficacy and safety: Diclofenac is the only commercially manufactured topical NSAID currently available in the U.S., and trials found topical diclofenac to be superior to placebo and equivalent to oral diclofenac at reducing pain associated with OA of the knee, with another RCT showing no significant difference between topical and oral diclofenac; diclofenac gel provided statistically significant pain relief over placebo and vehicle control. Studies with topical ketoprofen and topical piroxicam compared to oral NSAIDs showed no significant difference in pain reduction, and topical NSAIDs showed indirect superiority over oral acetaminophen, opioids, and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, although these agents have not been compared in head-to-head trials. Treatment with topical NSAIDs was associated with significantly fewer gastrointestinal adverse events but more local adverse events compared to oral NSAIDs; safety data are mostly limited to 12-week follow-up, two open-label studies showed the safety profile of topical diclofenac at one year to be consistent with results at 12 weeks, and the systematic evidence review yielded no studies evaluating the effect of topical NSAIDs on pain associated with OA of the hip.

Outcomes

The primary outcomes were changes from baseline in the WOMAC pain subscores on a 100-mm VAS, 50-foot walk test pain scores on a 100-mm VAS, and daily pain score on an 11-point numerical rating scale according to the patients' diaries. The WOMAC pain subscores and 50-foot walk test pain score were assessed at each visit, and the diary was filled out by the patient every day. The data at each time point were the mean values from the last visit to the day before the time point.

The secondary outcomes were the changes from baseline in the WOMAC (stiffness subscores, physical function subscores and total scores on a 100-mm VAS), responder rate/strict responder rate according to the OMERACT and Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OMERACT-OARSI) responder criteria, scores for the patient/physician global assessment and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Japanese standard version 2, and consumption of acetaminophen provided as a rescue medication.

The safety outcomes were treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), treatment-related TEAEs and serious TEAEs. These were defined as any investigator-assessed unfavourable or unintended sign, symptom or disease that occurred after the first injection, including abnormal clinical laboratory test results, vital signs and target knee examination findings (joint effusion, swelling and redness).

### Perioperative opioid-sparing strategies: utility of conventional NSAIDs in adults [^116Pnwr3]. Clinical Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Opioids have long been used to treat acute postsurgical and postprocedural pain; however, opioid-related adverse events (AEs) contribute to poor patient outcomes. In addition, perisurgical exposure to opioids can potentially increase the risk for opioid-use disorder. NSAIDs reduce pain and inflammation by a mechanism different from that of opioid analgesics and may be useful in reducing the need for opioid drugs as part of a multimodal analgesia strategy. We conducted this review to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of adjunctive conventional NSAIDs given systemically in the perioperative setting in terms of opioid-sparing effects observed postoperatively.

Methods

Clinical trials published since 2000 that have assessed the opioid-sparing effects of conventional, nonselective NSAIDs were identified by a literature search using the PubMed search engine. Search terms were identified for the treatment of interest, the timing of the intervention, and the drugs of interest (NSAIDs). Data from studies that assessed opioid consumption outcomes with systemic NSAID administration were included in the review; data from studies in which NSAIDs were administered topically or via periarticular injection, local infiltration, or regional block were excluded.

Findings

Upon full-text review of the search results, 32 studies were chosen for inclusion in this literature review. These studies included those that assessed diclofenac, ketorolac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, dexketoprofen, flurbiprofen, lornoxicam, tenoxicam, meloxicam, and piroxicam. In studies in which NSAIDs were associated with opioid-sparing effects within the setting of patient-controlled analgesia, opioid use was reduced by 17%-∼50% with diclofenac, 9%-66% with ketorolac, 22%-46% with ibuprofen, 34%-66% with ketoprofen, 36%-50% with dexketoprofen, 38%-41% with tenoxicam, 36%-54% with lornoxicam, and ∼50% with flurbiprofen. No opioid-sparing effect was noted with meloxicam (1 study). The majority of studies that reported on pain-score changes revealed either pain reductions with NSAIDs versus placebo or similar pain scores between groups, indicating that NSAIDs did not compromise pain control. Although many studies found no difference in the prevalence of AEs in NSAID-treated patients compared with controls, several studies noted lower rates of nausea, vomiting, sedation, and pruritus with NSAIDs versus placebo. Conversely, NSAID-related AEs were few overall but included gastrointestinal bleeding, injection site reactions, transient oliguric renal failure, and dizziness. No surgery-related bleeding complications were observed.

Implications

NSAIDs have the potential to play an important role in reducing postoperative opioid requirements. Reducing the amount of opioids used could be expected to reduce opioid-related side effects and contribute to reversing the opioid epidemic.

Methods

Study design and patients

This multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group comparison phase 2 study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiple IA injections of DF-HA (Seikagaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) in patients with knee OA at 18 sites in Japan. The study was performed in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guideline and in conformity with the Declaration of Helsinki. The institutional review board of each participating centre approved the study, and all patients provided written informed consent.

At the time of screening, eligible patients were 40–75 years of age and had a diagnosis of knee OA according to the ACR, a ≥ 12-week history of pain, a Kellgren–Lawrence radiographic score of 2 or 3 at the target knee, a mean WOMAC pain subscore of 50–90 mm (inclusive) at the target knee, and a mean visual analogue scale (VAS) score of ≤ 30 mm at the contralateral knee (100-mm VAS). Additionally, the 50-foot walk test pain score was added to the eligibility criteria in the middle of the study because some patients had imbalanced pain ratings involving a low score for the 50-foot walk test but a high WOMAC pain subscore. The exclusion criteria were secondary OA, other diseases involving pain in the lower extremity, a surgical or invasive procedure involving the lower extremity, or a BMI of ≥ 35.0 kg/m 2.

Randomization and blinding

Patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either the DF-HA or placebo group by a minimization method using an interactive Web response system, according to a random allocation sequence generated by an independent assignment manager in the Web response centre. Patients were stratified within each site according to a Kellgren–Lawrence score of 2 or 3, a mean VAS score of < 70 or ≥ 70 mm for five items of the baseline WOMAC pain subscale, and a baseline VAS score of < 70 or ≥ 70 mm for the 50-foot walk pain test. The study was conducted in a double-blind manner. The appearance, preparation method and injection procedure, but not the viscosity, were identical between DF-HA and placebo. Therefore, the physician who injected the investigational drugs and the investigator who assessed the outcomes were separated, and the former was not allowed to evaluate the efficacy and safety. Except for the investigator who injected the investigational drugs, all patients, investigators, and other stakeholders were blinded to treatment allocation until database closure.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Diclofenac has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.

The mechanism of action of diclofenac sodium, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2)

Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

After topical administration to healthy human volunteers of single and multiple maximum doses of diclofenac sodium topical solution, 40 drops (approximately 1.2 mL) to each knee (80 drops total dose), the following diclofenac pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained: (see Table 2).

Table 2: Single-Dose (80 drops) and Multiple Dose (80 drops four times daily for 7 days) Diclofenac Sodium Topical Solution, 1.5% w/w Pharmacokinetic Parameters

1Apparent total body clearance

Absorption

Diclofenac systemic exposure from diclofenac sodium topical solution application (4 times daily for 1 week) was approximately 1/3 of the diclofenac systemic exposure from the Solaraze (diclofenac topical gel) application (twice daily for 4 weeks).

Outcome measures

The primary outcome measure was the WOMAC pain subscale score, measured on a 100‐mm VAS, and the primary end point was the mean change from baseline in WOMAC pain subscale score at 12 weeks. The secondary outcome measures were WOMAC index score (stiffness subscale score, physical function subscale score, and total score on a 100‐mm VAS), pain score on a 100‐mm VAS after a 50‐foot walking test, daily pain score on an 11‐point numerical rating scale as recorded in the subject's diary, rates of responders and strict responders according to the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT)–Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) response criteria, patient global assessment, physician global assessment, Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF‐36) health survey, EuroQol 5‐domain (EQ‐5D), and acetaminophen consumption.

Safety was evaluated by monitoring treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs) after the initial injection, based on the definitions listed in Supplementary Table 1, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology website at. AEs that led to study drug withdrawal were considered important AEs, while those that occurred at the injection site, and were associated with GI disorders, CV disorders, renal dysfunction, anaphylactic reaction, or hypersensitivity were considered AEs of special interest.

Clinical laboratory tests (hematology, blood biochemistry, and urine test), measurement of vital signs (body temperature, blood pressure, and pulse rate), examination of the target knee (for joint effusion, swelling, redness, and warmth) to assess the injection site reaction, and radiography, including anteroposterior standing, lateral standing, and patellar axial radiographs to observe structural changes (worsening) in the target knee (osteophytes, joint space narrowing, osteosclerosis, or deformity of epiphysis) were conducted based on the protocol at preinjection and at 24 weeks or at the time of study discontinuation. To prevent variations in evaluation at each site, instructions for radiography were distributed (Supplementary Table 2, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology website at). Imaging evaluation was performed by the investigator. Findings that were judged by the investigator to be unfavorable or unintended were considered AEs.

Acute low back pain — diclofenac–K 12.5 mg vs ibuprofen 200 mg vs placebo in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial showed greater early pain relief and pain intensity differences with diclofenac–K, similar adverse events to ibuprofen and higher adverse events in placebo, and Level I evidence supports short‑term (one week) safety and efficacy. Adults aged 18–60 years with acute LBP ≥ 50 mm on a 100 mm VAS were randomized to diclofenac–K 12.5 mg (n = 124), ibuprofen 200 mg (n = 122), or placebo (n = 126) and followed a flexible regimen of 2 tablets initially, then 1–2 every 4–6 hours, not exceeding 6 per day; pain (4–point) and relief (5–point) were recorded at 30 minutes and hourly for 6 hours, FD efficacy (5–point) assessed at 6 hours, and 100–mm VAS and Eifel questionnaire completed at baseline and day 7. Compared with placebo, diclofenac–K produced significantly greater overall pain relief after the first 2 hours and greater pain intensity differences over 6 hours, with greater pain intensity differences over the first 3 hours than both placebo and ibuprofen; adverse events were similar to ibuprofen and higher in placebo, with digestive events most frequent and no serious outcomes or deaths, and the authors concluded diclofenac–K 12.5 mg is effective and safe, providing Level I evidence for short‑term use.

### Can we improve the existing management of pain after cesarean delivery at Eastern regional referral hospital? A retrospective study [^1164mVEn]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pain after surgery is generally considered undertreated worldwide. This may be because of insufficient skills in the management of pain. Inadequate management of pain after cesarean delivery (CD) can adversely affect the well-being of both mothers and newborns, potentially leading to a higher incidence of chronic post-operative pain. This study aimed to review the existing management of pain associated with CD and identify gaps for future improvement in the quality of pain care at Eastern Regional Referral Hospital (ERRH).

Methods

This retrospective review of the management of pain after CDs, was conducted between December 2017 and December 2018 at ERRH, Bhutan. A total of 107 CDs were reviewed.

Results

Of the 107 patients reviewed, only 2% had received analgesics before surgery, and 20% of them during surgery. The majority of the patients (63%) has received a single injection of diclofenac sodium, followed by oral ibuprofen (56%) on the following day.

Conclusions

Despite the availability of resources, the present review revealed that the existing management of pain after CDs was mostly a single-drug therapy, mainly focusing on only post-operative period.

### Sustained-release diclofenac conjugated to hyaluronate (diclofenac etalhyaluronate) for knee osteoarthritis: a randomized phase 2 study [^112GJxDh]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

The results of a previous study (UMIN000010167) in which 121 patients with knee OA were randomly allocated into three groups to receive a single IA injection of 15 mg of DF-HA (n = 40), 30 mg of DF-HA (n = 41) or placebo (n = 40) suggested the efficacy of 30 mg of DF-HA (unpublished observation). In the present study, the sample size was set at 160 patients (n = 80 in each group) with consideration of feasibility and the results of the previous study.

Efficacy was evaluated in the full analysis set, which included patients who received at least one injection of the investigational drug. The primary endpoints (least square mean changes in the primary outcomes from baseline over 12 weeks after the first injection) were compared between the two treatment groups using a mixed model for repeated measures at each time point from week 1 through 12. The model included the baseline scores, treatment, time point, treatment-by-time point interaction, and Kellgren–Lawrence grading score as fixed effects. An unstructured covariance was used to model the covariance structure among repeated measures. As a secondary analysis, the primary outcomes at each time point from week 1 through 24 were compared between the two treatment groups using the same model as for the primary analyses. The same analysis approach as used for the primary outcomes was repeated for the secondary outcomes of the WOMAC (stiffness subscores, physical function subscores and total scores), patient/physician global assessment scores, and three summary scores of the SF-36. The responder rate/strict responder rate according to the OMERACT-OARSI responder criteria were analysed using generalized estimating equations from week 1 to week 12 and from week 1 to week 24. The changes in the mean consumption of acetaminophen per day from baseline were summarized by treatment and time point using descriptive statistics. Two-sided P -values of < 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. Multiplicity was not considered to evaluate the effectiveness in an exploratory manner.

Safety was evaluated in the safety set, which included patients who received the treatment at least once. All reported TEAEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities v.18.1; other safety outcomes were summarized by treatment group. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS v.9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

Intervention

Patients were screened between 1 week before randomization and the day of randomization. All patients received an IA injection of either the DF-HA (prefilled syringe containing 30 mg per 3 mL of DF-HA; Seikagaku Corporation) or the placebo drug (prefilled syringe containing 3 mL of citric acid–sodium citrate buffered solution; Seikagaku Corporation) at weeks 0, 4 and 8. The patients were followed up for 24 weeks after the first injection (at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20 and 24).

The patients were prohibited from using analgesic medications, including NSAIDs, CS, opioids or psychotherapeutic drugs that affect the assessment of disease-associated pain, throughout the study period after providing informed consent. The use of acetaminophen as a rescue medication for pain relief in the target knee was permitted, but its use was prohibited from 2 days prior to each visit, including screening. Patients receiving regular physical therapy for the target knee before the start of screening were allowed to continue this therapy during the study if the frequency and intensity were not increased. The patients were instructed not to change the intensity or frequency of exercise performed in their daily activities.

### Importance of the formulation in the skin delivery of topical diclofenac: not all topical diclofenac formulations are the same [^111UPNfg]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to treat acute and chronic pain, but their long-term use may be limited by systemic side effects such as gastrointestinal toxicity and the potential for certain cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications.–Topical administration of NSAIDs offers clinical efficacy similar to oral NSAIDs, fewer systemic adverse events, and a reduced risk of drug–drug interactions.–The NSAID diclofenac has demonstrated efficacy in treating a variety of acute and chronic pain conditions. Diclofenac is a good choice of topical NSAID based on a number-needed-to-treat of 1.8 for acute painand 9.8 for chronic pain, as reported in a recent Cochrane meta-analysis. Topical diclofenac is available in several different forms, including gel, spray, emulsion, aqueous solution, cream, and transdermal patch.

Although it may be assumed that the skin permeation will be directly proportional to the drug concentration, according to Fick's law, other drug physicochemical parameters may influence drug permeation. According to O'Connor et al, diclofenac sodium seems to have a higher rate of transport than diclofenac DEA, which is related to the higher saturation solubility of diclofenac sodiumFormulation composition such as choice of vehicle (solutions, gels, emulsions, microemulsions, particles, liposomes, and transfersomes) and inclusion of penetration enhancers and characteristics such as water solubility and acidity may influence the ability of topical formulations to permeate the skin and deeper tissues. To demonstrate the importance of the formulation parameters and composition regardless of the drug concentration, an in vitro skin permeation study was undertaken to compare the permeability of 2 commercially available topical products: diclofenac diethylamine (DEA) 1.16% emulsion (GlaxoSmithKline, Munich, Germany), which corresponds to 1% of diclofenac sodium (Na), and diclofenac Na 5% gel (Sandoz, Holzkirchen, Germany). The qualitative composition and physical characteristics of diclofenac DEA 1.16% emulsion and diclofenac Na 5% gel were also assessed in order to provide further insight, which could explain observed differences in skin permeation.

### Necrosis of the thumb after inadvertent injection of diclofenac in the radial artery: a case report [^113kk26A]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Since the introduction of thiopental in 1943, other reported drugs for intra-arterial injection have included psychotropic drugs or anesthetics such as promethazine, propofol, diazepam, methohexital, depomedrol, and benzodiazepine. Intra-arterial drug injections mostly occur because of iatrogenic complications during anesthesia procedures, as well as in drug abusers who perform self-injection without any anatomical knowledge. However, normal arterial drug injection is used for the treatment of femoral artery pseudoaneurysm, chemotherapy for some tumors and monitoring catheter during anesthesia or in the intensive care unit. Diclofenac sodium, which was injected in the patient in this case, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug commonly used in clinical settings, and usually administered through intramuscular or intravenous injection. The known adverse effects of intramuscular injection of diclofenac include rhabdomyolysis and myopathy. Samanta and Samantaand Kumar et alreported cases of amputation due to necrosis of the finger after an intra-arterial injection of diclofenac in a radial artery mistaken for a vein. The rate of amputation of an extremity due to the adverse effects of intra-arterial drug injection is 29%. Among such cases, the rate of amputation resulting from intra-arterial benzodiazepine injection is high (up to 50%).

### Diclofenac sodium topical (diclofenac sodium 1.5%) [^111PenxY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)].

Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery

Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].

Post-MI Patients

Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.

Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.

### When should diclofenac be given in ambulatory surgery: preoperatively or postoperatively? [^113nacFG]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To determine the optimum time of administration of diclofenac in patients undergoing ambulatory knee arthroscopy: either preoperatively or postoperatively.

Design

Randomized, double-blind study.

Setting

Ambulatory surgical unit in a tertiary referral hospital.

Patients

127 ASA physical status I and II patients undergoing ambulatory knee arthroscopy.

Interventions

Patients were randomized into three groups. The Preop group received 50 mg of potassium diclofenac orally 1 hour preoperatively and a placebo 30 minutes postoperatively. The Pre+postop group received 25 mg of potassium diclofenac 1 hour preoperatively and 25 mg diclofenac 30 minutes postoperatively. The Postop group received a placebo 1 hour before surgery and 50 mg of potassium diclofenac 30 minutes postoperatively.

Measurements and Main Results

The Postop group received a placebo 1 hour preoperatively and 50 mg of potassium diclofenac 30 min postoperatively. Postoperatively, patients used intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with fentanyl. Total fentanyl consumption was recorded. During the recovery period, pain was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) at 30-minute intervals. Pain was assessed in both legs at rest, on flexion, and extension of the knee. There were no significant differences in pain scores either at rest or on movement of the operative knee among the Preop, Pre+postop, and Postop groups. The consumption of fentanyl via PCA showed no significant differences among the groups.

Conclusions

There is no difference in pain relief whether diclofenac is given preoperatively or postoperatively in patients undergoing unilateral ambulatory knee arthroscopy. Preoperative and postoperative treatment with diclofenac potassium is equally effective.

### Efficacy and safety of diclofenac-hyaluronate conjugate (diclofenac etalhyaluronate) for knee osteoarthritis: a randomized phase III trial in Japan [^114r7nyA]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

This study had some limitations. Data were collected from a limited population that only comprised Japanese patients, there were no data for the excluded patient population (e.g. patients with a BMI of ≥ 35.0 kg/m 2), no information was obtained on combinations with other analgesics because use of other analgesics was prohibited, and the study did not evaluate safety with regard to joint tissues, including joint cartilage. Active treatment–controlled clinical trials are needed to evaluate the clinical usefulness of DF‐HA, and how long the effect of DF‐HA lasts after IA treatment is stopped should be investigated in future clinical studies. Additional safety data are needed, since the number of subjects in this study was relatively small, and the long‐term safety of DF‐HA treatment exceeding 24 weeks should be determined because the treatment term may be longer in actual clinical practice than that assessed in this study. In addition, evaluation of safety with regard to the joint tissue including joint cartilage is needed, using imaging techniques other than radiography by a central measurement.

In conclusion, DF‐HA, a conjugated compound with the advantages of IA HA and NSAIDs, promoted significant improvements in symptoms, with fast‐acting, long‐lasting efficacy in knee OA patients when injected once every 4 weeks. Anaphylactic reactions were observed, and further safety evaluation is needed. Although future studies are needed to further demonstrate its clinical usefulness, DF‐HA is expected to be a novel therapeutic agent fulfilling an unmet need for pharmacotherapy for knee OA.

Topical NSAIDs versus systemic NSAIDs — recommendation and renal safety data: Topical NSAIDs are recommended for use in knee osteoarthritis based on evidence of equivalent efficacy for improving pain and function and superior systemic adverse effect profiles compared to oral NSAIDs. Multiple meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials indicate adverse effects of topical NSAIDs are similar to placebo except for increased local adverse effects, mostly mild skin reactions. Diclofenac is a topical NSAID approved in the U.S. for osteoarthritis, and in a pooled safety analysis of 7 RCTs of topical diclofenac 1.5% use, among 138 patients using topical diclofenac for 4–12 weeks, no patients experienced a serious kidney adverse event; changes in blood pressure and kidney function were similar between the diclofenac and placebo/control groups. Studies with topical diclofenac also report that the level attained in blood is 0.4–2.2% of the maximum serum.

Absorption, distribution, and elimination

In addition to dose, the therapeutic activity and side effects of NSAIDs depend on their absorption, distribution, and elimination; these pharmacokinetic parameters can differ substantially between different NSAIDs. As with any analgesic class, the rate of absorption is a key factor in the selection of an NSAID; those with rapid absorption are preferable for most patients, particularly those with severe or acute pain. For example, celecoxib, which has a relatively slow rate of absorption, can be administered at standard doses to effectively treat osteoarthritis pain, but is not ideal for treatment of acute pain as it takes considerable time for absorption and often requires a loading dose to achieve clinically meaningful analgesia.

The distribution of NSAIDs in injured tissues, blood, and other areas of the body is a particularly crucial consideration for ensuring activity at the site of inflammation, as well as reducing the risk of side effects unrelated to therapeutic activity on COX enzymes throughout the body.NSAIDs can be classified as acidic or non-acidic based on their chemical structure, and the acidity of the drug can have an effect on its distribution. NSAIDs with acidic functional groups (eg, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen) and with a high degree of protein binding have been shown to selectively accumulate and persist at sites of inflammation,–while non-acidic NSAIDs (eg, acetaminophen, celecoxib, rofecoxib) tend to be distributed homogenously throughout the body. Acidic NSAIDs with a high degree of protein binding may remain in inflamed tissues or synovial fluid for a longer time than in the plasma (Figure 4). For example, diclofenac 75 mg (enteric-coated) reaches peak concentrations in the synovial fluid that exceed plasma concentrations at 4 hours after oral administration in patients with arthritis; these high and persistent synovial levels are maintained above or near the expected IC 80 for COX-2 for up to 12 hours after dosing, with rapid disappearance of diclofenac from the plasma, even after repeated dosing. The persistence of certain NSAIDs (eg, diclofenac, ibuprofen) in the synovial fluid is associated with a sustained therapeutic effect despite relatively rapid clearance from the plasma, vascular wall, and kidneys, indicating that accumulation at sites of inflammation may allow for continued anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity. The localization of COX activity to inflamed tissue and the resulting ability to use lower doses than might otherwise be required also minimizes COX inhibition at sites associated with potential side effects (eg, hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal adverse effects).

### Necrosis of the thumb after inadvertent injection of diclofenac in the radial artery: a case report [^1147khK4]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Since the report by Macintosh in 1943 about the complications arising from an inadvertent intra-arterial injection of thiopental, the dangers of intra-arterial drug injection have been reported in various papers. Intra-arterial drug injections mostly occur accidentally, mainly as iatrogenic complications during anesthesia procedures. The adverse effects, which were reported to occur in up to 29% of patients, are serious, including necrosis, leading to amputation of the affected extremity, infection, pseudoaneurysm, rhabdomyolysis, and compartment syndrome. However, the etiology of such adverse effects has not been clearly identified and treatment methods have not been established yet. Therefore, prevention of inadvertent intra-arterial drug injection is the most important solution to this problem. Persons who belong to the high-risk group for inadvertent intra-arterial drug injection include obese individuals whose veins are difficult to find, drug abusers who perform self-injection without any anatomical knowledge, and those with vascular variations in the forearms. We had encountered a case of necrosis of the thumb after an intra-arterial injection of diclofenac sodium in an artery that was mistaken for a vein in a patient with arterial variation in the forearm. In this study, we report the dangers of intra-arterial drug injection, and the prevention and treatment of its associated effects, along with a literature review.

### Pharmacokinetic profile of an intradeltoid diclofenac injection in obese Indian volunteers [^111Zc9qF]. Journal of Pain Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background

A new propylene glycol-free and reduced-volume formulation of diclofenac sodium 75 mg/mL designed for intradeltoid administration has been found to be bioequivalent to a reference formulation of diclofenac sodium 75 mg/3 mL given via the intragluteal route in normal healthy volunteers. Standard needles may not reach the gluteus maximus muscle in many cases, especially in the obese. The objective of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of the new formulation and compare the bioavailability of intradeltoid diclofenac sodium 75 mg/mL with that of the intragluteal 75 mg/3 mL reference formulation in obese volunteers.

Methods

A comparative, two-way, single-dose, bioavailability study was carried out in 10 obese (body mass index > 25) male Indian volunteers after a washout period of seven days. Blood samples were collected until six hours following drug administration and analyzed using a prevalidated high-pressure liquid chromatography method.

Results

The mean maximum plasma concentration and time to reach maximum plasma concentration for the test formulation were 1.30 μg/mL and 0.50 hours, respectively, versus 0.93 μg/ mL and 1.08 hours for the reference formulation. The mean areas under the curve from 0 to last measurable time point (AUC(0-t)) for the test and reference formulations were 2.71 μg·h/mL and 2.73 μg·h/mL, respectively. The mean AUCs from 0 to infinity (AUC(0-∞)) for the test and reference formulations were 3.71 μg·h/mL and 3.75 μg·h/mL, respectively.

Conclusion

The results suggest that the test formulation of diclofenac sodium 75 mg/mL has an AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-∞) comparable with the reference intragluteal formulation of diclofenac sodium 75 mg/3 mL, but with an earlier time to reach maximum plasma concentration and a trend towards a higher maximum plasma concentration. This could be attributed to faster absorption from the deltoid region than from the gluteal region. The test formulation could be helpful in the management of pain in obese or overweight patients and those with dense subcutaneous fat in the gluteal area.

### Guidelines of care for the management of actinic keratosis [^116SS6ad]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Diclofenac gel — efficacy and safety for actinic keratosis (AK) involve 3% diclofenac in a 2.5% hyaluronic acid vehicle, with benefits and potential harms assessed as small, and topical diclofenac carrying a boxed warning for increased cardiovascular thrombotic and gastrointestinal risks. Four RCTs were identified; in one twice daily regimen for a mean of 60 days, clearance was 33% versus 10% with vehicle (P < .05). Pooled data from two vehicle-controlled studies of twice daily 90-day treatment showed 42% complete clearance versus 14% with vehicle (RR, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.85–4.65; P < .00001). Treatment-site adverse events occurred in 29% with twice daily diclofenac for 24 weeks versus 4.7% with vehicle (RR, 6.19; 95% CI, 1.92–19.98; p = 0.002), and pooled discontinuation due to adverse events was 15% with diclofenac and 4% with vehicle (RR, 3.59; 95% CI, 1.92–6.70; P < .0001).

### An integrated safety analysis of intravenous ibuprofen (caldolor (®)) in adults [^114XhiE7]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Overall, IV ibuprofen demonstrates a favorable safety profile resulting in fewer AEs relative to subjects who received placebo with morphine rescue, with the exception of infusion site reactions. In clinical trials, administration of IV ibuprofen has been accomplished in as little as 5–7 minutes and has been administered prior to surgical incision with no increase in AEs relative to patients receiving doses over 30 minutes either intra- or postoperatively. Patients receiving IV ibuprofen require less morphine and experience less pain than do their placebo-treated counterparts with no measurable increases in surgical blood loss, perioperative CV, renal, or respiratory adverse effects. Our results echo those of previously published meta-analyses indicating a low RR for ibuprofen (1.8) vs diclofenac (3.3: 183% increased risk) or ketorolac (11.5: 639% increased risk). Thus, IV ibuprofen can be safely given prior to surgery and continued in the postoperative period as a component of multimodal pain management.
