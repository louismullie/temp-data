## Question

What is the ICD-10 code for social anxiety disorder?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ICD-10 code for social anxiety disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact diagnostic entity and its synonyms in ICD-10. Then, I should verify the ICD-10 alphanumeric code from authoritative sources. Next, I will check whether any subtypes or specifiers change the code. Finally, I will confirm the code's placement within the ICD-10 hierarchy and note any ICD-11 changes for context, while ensuring I cite the best available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic entity. Social anxiety disorder is synonymous with social phobia in ICD-10, and it is classified among phobic anxiety disorders, which helps anchor the code family I should be looking for [^8a4b3ea9].

> Now, I need to verify the specific ICD-10 code. Multiple high-quality sources consistently report the ICD-10 code for social anxiety disorder/social phobia as F40.1, including epidemiologic cohorts and administrative coding studies that explicitly list social anxiety disorder under F40.1, and this aligns with the broader F40 phobic anxiety disorders block in ICD-10 [^8a4b3ea9] [^09afd3da] [^e72a5109].

> Wait, let me verify whether any subtypes or specifiers alter the code. In ICD-10, social phobia is coded as F40.1 without routine subtyping, and while clinicians may describe generalized versus non-generalized forms, the base code remains F40.1; this is distinct from DSM-5, which uses 300.23 for social anxiety disorder and allows specifiers, underscoring that the ICD-10 code is simpler and fixed at F40.1 [^8a4b3ea9] [^5943af06].

> I should confirm the hierarchical placement to ensure consistency. Social phobia sits within the F40 block for phobic anxiety disorders, which also includes agoraphobia and specific phobias, and this placement is consistent with ICD-10's structure and with large epidemiologic datasets that group social phobia under F40.1 within the anxiety spectrum [^8a4b3ea9] [^09afd3da].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about ICD-11. I need to check whether the code changes in the newer system. In ICD-11, social anxiety disorder is reclassified under "anxiety or fear-related disorders", but the question is specifically about ICD-10, so the correct ICD-10 code remains F40.1 regardless of ICD-11 updates [^fd0c9247] [^3ab4a856].

> Final answer: The ICD-10 code for social anxiety disorder (social phobia) is F40.1 [^8a4b3ea9] [^09afd3da] [^e72a5109].

The ICD-10 code for social anxiety disorder (social phobia) is **F40.1**. This code belongs to the F40–F48 block for neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders, specifically within the phobic anxiety disorders subgroup. Accurate use of **F40.1** supports consistent diagnosis, billing, and epidemiologic tracking across healthcare systems [^09afd3da] [^8a4b3ea9].

## ICD-10 code for social anxiety disorder

- **ICD-10 code**: F40.1
- **Disorder name**: Social anxiety disorder (social phobia)
- **Category**: Phobic anxiety disorders (F40)

---

## Clinical description and diagnostic criteria

Social anxiety disorder is characterized by a **marked and persistent fear** of social or performance situations in which the individual is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others. The fear is of acting in a way that will be humiliating or embarrassing. Common situations include public speaking, meeting new people, eating or drinking in public, and participating in social gatherings.

Diagnostic criteria typically include:

- **Marked fear or anxiety** about one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others.
- **Fear of acting** in a way that will show anxiety symptoms and that will be negatively evaluated.
- **Social situations** almost always provoke fear or anxiety.
- **Social situations** are avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety.
- **The fear or anxiety** is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation.
- **The fear, anxiety, or avoidance** persists for at least six months.
- **The fear, anxiety, or avoidance** causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

---

## Prevalence and clinical significance

Social anxiety disorder is a common mental health condition with significant clinical and public health implications. According to epidemiological studies, the **lifetime prevalence** of social anxiety disorder is approximately 7–12% globally, with a 12-month prevalence of around 7% [^6d68e3e8] [^8b8ed6d9]. The disorder often begins in childhood or adolescence and, if untreated, can persist into adulthood, leading to substantial impairment in social, occupational, and academic functioning [^8a3cd4b0].

---

## Comorbidity

Social anxiety disorder frequently co-occurs with other mental health conditions, including:

- **Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)**: F41.1
- **Major depressive disorder (MDD)**: F32.x, F33.x
- **Panic disorder**: F41.0
- **Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)**: F42.x
- **Substance use disorders**: F10–F19

Comorbidity is associated with increased severity, functional impairment, and reduced quality of life, underscoring the importance of accurate diagnosis and comprehensive treatment planning [^4d139b4a] [^5bb4e4a3].

---

## Treatment implications

Accurate coding with **F40.1** facilitates appropriate treatment planning and reimbursement. Evidence-based treatments for social anxiety disorder include:

- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Considered first-line psychotherapy, particularly exposure-based CBT.
- **Pharmacotherapy**: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are effective pharmacological treatments [^6e95f9ec].
- **Combination therapy**: CBT combined with pharmacotherapy may be beneficial for severe or refractory cases.

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10 code for social anxiety disorder is **F40.1**, which is essential for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and epidemiological tracking. Social anxiety disorder is a prevalent and clinically significant condition that requires comprehensive assessment and evidence-based interventions to reduce its substantial burden on individuals and society [^1acd656d].

### The classification of anxiety and fear-related disorders in the ICD-11 [^3545d45a]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent worldwide and engender substantial economic costs and disability. The World Health Organization is currently developing the Eleventh Revision of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11), which represents the first opportunity to improve the validity, clinical utility, and global applicability of the classification in more than 25 years. This article describes changes in the organization and diagnostic guidelines for anxiety and fear-related disorders proposed by the ICD-11 Working Group on the Classification of Mood and Anxiety Disorders and the rationale and evidence base for the proposals. In ICD-11, anxiety and fear-related disorders that manifest across the lifespan are brought together under a new grouping, and are partly distinguished by their focus of apprehension. The focus of apprehension is the stimulus or situation that triggers the fear or anxiety and may be highly specific as in specific phobia or relate to a broader class of situations as in social anxiety disorder. The guidelines also clarify the relationship between panic disorder and agoraphobia and a qualifier is provided for panic attacks in the context of other disorders. A standardized format emphasizing essential features of anxiety disorders is intended to improve clinical utility. Guidelines will be further refined based on findings from two types of field studies: those using a case-controlled vignette methodology disseminated via the Internet to practitioners worldwide (http://gcp.network) and clinic-based field trials implemented globally at participating field study centers.

### Mental, behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders in the ICD-11: an international perspective on key changes and controversies [^4008ad23]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The ICD-11 has maintained the a priori split between mood and anxiety disorders, despite empirical findings that generally show that GAD is more closely related to major depressive disorder than it is to the other anxiety disorders. However, by providing anxiety disorders their own grouping, including separation anxiety disorder with the other anxiety disorders, and removing the artificial split between phobic and other anxiety disorders, the structure of the ICD-11 more closely approximates evidence-based models of the structure of psychopathology. Furthermore, such categorization brings the ICD-11 into closer agreement with the DSM-5.

Additionally, the ICD-11 closely resembles the DSM-5 in its disorder descriptions. Particularly, a requirement that the disorder should result in significant distress or impairment has been added to the description of all anxiety disorders. For agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and GAD, a specification that symptoms must persist for at least several months has also been added. Moreover, the conceptual core of several disorders, particularly panic disorder, GAD, and OCD, has been updated to reflect current beliefs about these disorders. With regard to panic disorder, the ICD-10 exclusively focused on the presence of unexpected panic attacks; however, in the ICD-11, persistent concerns about these panic attacks and/or attempts to avoid the recurrence of panic attacks are also considered essential and impairing features of panic disorder. In the ICD-10, GAD was conceptualized as free-floating worry that does not predominate in any particular environmental circumstance. While the ICD-11 maintains free-floating anxiety as a possible symptom, excessive worry focused on multiple everyday events is also recognized as a possible core symptom of GAD. Finally, the ICD-10 defined compulsions by their putative function (to prevent a feared event), while the ICD-11 has a broader definition, including all repetitive behaviors that an individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, according to rigid rules, or to achieve a sense of 'completeness'. The ICD-11 also includes repetitive mental acts as compulsions, while the ICD-10 only focused on overt behaviour.

### Social anxiety disorder in DSM-5 [^5943af06]. Depression and Anxiety (2014). Low credibility.

With the publication of DSM-5, the diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder (SAD, also known as social phobia) have undergone several changes, which have important conceptual and clinical implications. In this paper, we first provide a brief history of the diagnosis. We then review a number of these changes, including (1) the primary name of the disorder, (2) the increased emphasis on fear of negative evaluation, (3) the importance of sociocultural context in determining whether an anxious response to a social situation is out of proportion to the actual threat, (4) the diagnosis of SAD in the context of a medical condition, and (5) the way in which we think about variations in the presentation of SAD (the specifier issue). We then consider the clinical implications of changes in DSM-5 related to these issues.

Social phobia is a prevalent anxiety disorder that may be treated with pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or both. This article reviews the empirical evidence for these interventions and discusses new treatment developments. Active ingredients and mechanisms involved in the effectiveness of treatment are discussed. In addition, the elements of social phobia and its treatment that are similar to other anxiety and non-anxiety disorders are considered. Finally, it discusses future efforts to improve diagnosis and treatment for social phobia, including possible revisions to the diagnostic criteria that might be considered in the forthcoming fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, as well as routine care and obstacles for dissemination.

### Under-recognition and under-treatment of DSM-IV classified mood and anxiety disorders among disability claimants [^4d59a0af]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to examine under-recognition, under-treatment and severity of under-treated DSM-IV mood and anxiety disorders among disability claimants.

Methods

In a representative sample of Dutch disability claimants (n = 346), registry codes certified according to the International Classification of Diseases 10th edition (ICD-10) by insurance physicians, were compared with classifications according to the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) detected by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Levels of ICD-10/DSM-IV agreement were assessed for mood and anxiety disorders in the total sample, and prevalence of recent DSM-IV mood and anxiety disorders in a pure ICD-10 somatic subgroup. Treatment and severity of under-treated DSM-IV mood and anxiety disorders were assessed in two subgroups of disability claimants with either an ICD-10 somatic or mental disorder as primary cause of disability, irrespective of any ICD-10 comorbidity.

Results

Levels of ICD-10/DSM-IV agreement were poor (κ: 0.237 for mood and 0.260 for anxiety disorders). In the pure ICD-10 somatic subgroup, the prevalence of DSM-IV mood and anxiety disorders was 3.8% and 11.4%, respectively. In the ICD-10 somatic subgroup irrespective of any ICD-10 comorbidity, 45.2% (major depressive disorder), 80.0% (social phobia) and 53.3% (general anxiety disorder) were under-treated. In the ICD-10 mental subgroup, these percentages were 44.7%, 80.9% and 33.4%, respectively. In both of these subgroups, under-treated DSM-IV mood and anxiety disorders were predominantly serious in terms of impairment and disability.

Conclusions

Serious mental disorders were found to be substantially under-diagnosed and under-treated among disability claimants. To optimize diagnosis and treatment of disabling mental disorder, medical professionals in insurance, occupational and in the health care sector should closely collaborate. For claimants with under-treated mental disorders, tailor-made multidisciplinary interventions are needed to promote return to work and to prevent permanent disability.

Exposure

Treatment-seeking individuals with a lifetime diagnosis of SAD according to the ICD-10 definition (code F40.1) (World Health Organization,), as recorded in the NPR, were considered exposed. In order to avoid misclassification, we set a minimal age threshold of 6 years for being diagnosed with the disorder. The ICD-10 code for SAD has been validated by our research group, showing good positive predictive values [PPV = 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72–0.88)] and substantial inter-rater reliability (κ = 0.72) (Vilaplana-Pérez et al.). Individuals without a diagnosis of SAD were considered unexposed.

From the NPR, we also extracted all lifetime psychiatric comorbidities for the members of our cohort and organised them in five groups: (1) neuropsychiatric disorders (including pervasive developmental disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorder, and learning disabilities); (2) other phobic, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and reaction to severe stress and adjustment disorders; (3) psychotic disorders (including schizophrenia, schizotypal, and delusional disorders); (4) affective disorders (including bipolar disorder, depressive disorders, and persistent mood disorders); and (5) substance use disorders (see online Supplementary Table S1 for details on ICD codes and age thresholds).

### Depression and anxiety among US children and young adults [^09afd3da]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Study Population

This population-based cohort study included all members 5 to 22 years of age on January 1 of each calendar year from 2017 to 2021 within Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), an integrated health care system with more than 4.6 million members, representative of the Southern California population and regional diversity. We identified a total of 1 703 090 unique KPSC members who were aged 5 to 22 years during the study period; 1 339 549 (78.7%) had multiple years of KPSC membership, with approximately 1 million unique members per calendar year. Kaiser Permanente Southern California has a well-established comprehensive EMR system with social, demographic, and health care data. This study was approved by KPSC Institutional Review Boards, with individual participant consent waived because the research involved no more than minimal risk to participants and the research could not practicably be performed without the requested waiver. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for cohort studies.

Clinical Diagnosis of Depression and Anxiety

A diagnosis of depression was identified based on clinical encounters with at least 1 code from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), that corresponds with the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) criteria for the subclassification of MDD with single (F32.0-F32.3 and F32.9) or recurrent (F33.0-F33.3 and F33.9) episodes or persistent depressive disorder (dysthymic disorder) (F34.1). Anxiety was ascertained based on clinical encounters with at least 1 ICD-10 code for anxiety states (F06.4, F40, F41, and F93.8), such as generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorders, and other phobia-related disorders. Records from both inpatient and outpatient encounters were used. Prior studies have used these codes to identify depression and anxiety. All ICD-10 codes are listed in eTable 1 in Supplement 1.

### DSM-5: a collection of psychiatrist views on the changes, controversies, and future directions [^49e0b395]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

One consequence of the new definition is that the disorder is much more heterogeneous than it was previously deemed to be. As a result of its multiple cluster format, PTSD has traditionally been a very heterogeneous disorder in DSM, because to satisfy the criteria there must be a minimum number of symptoms from each cluster: in DSM-5, at least one of five re-experiencing symptoms, one of two avoidance symptoms, three of seven cognition and mood symptoms, and three of six hyperarousal symptoms. Considering the various combinations of symptoms required to meet the definition of the one disorder called PTSD, it involves a very high number of very distinct possible combinations. In DSM-IV, this resulted in a total of 79,794 symptom presentations. By adding more symptoms and an additional cluster, DSM-5 results in 636,120 possible combinations. This is in marked contrast to the conditions such as Panic Disorder (3), Social Phobia (1), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (3), or Major Depression (227). A potentially significant consequence of this lack of homogeneity is that it may represent a significant obstacle to research that attempts to identify characteristic markers of the disorder. Although there has been enormous attention given in recent years to biological or cognitive markers of PSTD, this research has typically resulted in mixed findings, lack of replication, or poor specificity. One strong possibility for the lack of progress on this front is that the many different clinical presentations that are encompassed by the PTSD diagnosis may hinder any attempt to identify a single mechanism or marker.

Although DSM-5 aims to enhance clinical utility, and in this sense the PTSD diagnosis tries to make it more relevant to those affected by war and crime, future studies will shed light on whether this has been successful. It is noticeable that the new proposals for PTSD in ICD-11 have taken an opposite perspective, and elected to simplify the diagnosis, while directing clinicians to core features of the disorder. The increased heterogeneity reflected in DSM-5 raises serious questions about the utility of the diagnosis for furthering the research agenda. Given the many questions that abound concerning the neural, genetic, cognitive, and behavioral features of the disorder, we are doubtful that the new definition will facilitate clarification of these issues.

### Social phobia in the Australian national survey of mental health and well-being (NSMHWB) [^06a95015]. Psychological Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

This article reports data on social phobia from the first large scale Australian epidemiological study. Prevalence rates, demographic correlates and co-morbidity in the sample that met criteria for social phobia are reported and gender differences examined.

Method

Data were obtained from a stratified sample of 10641 participants as part of the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being (NSMHWB). A modified version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was used to determine the presence of social phobia, as well as other DSM-IV anxiety, affective and substance use disorders. The interview also screened for the presence of nine ICD-10 personality disorders, including anxious personality disorder, the equivalent of DSM-IV avoidant personality disorder (APD).

Results

The estimated 12 month prevalence of social phobia was 2.3%, lower than rates reported in several recent nationally representative epidemiological surveys and closer to those reported in the Epidemiological Catchment Area study (ECA) and other DSM-III studies. Considerable co-morbidity was identified. Data indicated that the co-morbidity with depression and alcohol abuse and dependence were generally subsequent to onset of social phobia and that the additional diagnosis of APD was associated with a greater burden of affective disorder. Social phobia most often preceded major depression, alcohol abuse and generalized anxiety disorder.

Conclusions

Social phobia is a highly prevalent, highly co-morbid disorder in the Australian community. Individuals with social phobia who also screen positively for APD appear to be at greater risk of co-morbidity with all surveyed disorders except alcohol abuse or dependence.

### Subtypes of social phobia: are they of any use? [^cf5b5e00]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

This study investigated the existence of DSM-IV social phobia subtype models in the community. Data came from the Dresden Predictor Study of a representative sample of 1877 German women (aged 18–24 years) who completed a diagnostic interview and filled out various self-report questionnaires. The number of feared social situations was distributed continuously without a clear-cut for delineation of subtypes and significantly increased functional impairment, comorbidity, subjective need for psychotherapy, seeking psychotherapeutic help and dysfunctional attitudes, and decreased social support and mental health. Subtype models based on the number (1, 2–4 and > 4) and type ('formal speaking fear' versus 'other fears') of social fear did not have extra value above the continuum model of social phobia. The heterogeneity within social phobia has to be seen as a continuum of severity of social phobia, with a greater number of feared situations associated with more functional, social and psychological disability.

### Mental, behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders in the ICD-11: an international perspective on key changes and controversies [^fd0c9247]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

A new category of 'anxiety or fear-related disorders', which contains all anxiety disorders, including two (separation anxiety disorder and selective mutism) that were previously classed with childhood disorders, has been introduced in the ICD-11. Since anxiety disorders have similar symptoms (i.e. sympathetic arousal and avoidance), the ICD-11 emphasizes the focus of apprehension (e.g. fear of negative evaluation by others in the case of social anxiety disorder) as the basis for diagnostic differentiation between anxiety disorders. Hierarchical exclusion rules, which often precluded explicit diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, particularly in individuals with mood disorders, have also been removed in the ICD-11.

OCD has been placed into its own grouping of 'obsessive–compulsive or related disorders'. This grouping also includes several new disorders such as hoarding disorder and body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders (broadened from the ICD-10 diagnosis of trichotillomania). Hypochondriasis has also been moved from the category of 'somatoform disorders' into that of 'obsessive–compulsive or related disorders'.

### Beyond DSM-5: an alternative approach to assessing social anxiety disorder [^fa2f906b]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

This article focuses on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) classification of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). The article details the diagnostic criteria for SAD that have evolved in the various editions and demonstrates that whilst there have been some positive steps taken to more comprehensively define the disorder, further revision is necessary. It will be argued that the DSM-5 (APA, 2013) has made some changes to the diagnostic criteria of SAD that do not seem to be completely in line with theory and research and do not describe SAD effectively in terms of both diversity and presentation. This article concludes with the presentation of a proposed set of diagnostic criteria that address the concerns raised in the article. The proposed criteria reflect a hybrid categorical-dimensional system of classification.

### Overview and clinical presentation of generalized anxiety disorder [^1f387534]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

1. To distinguish GAD from panic disorder is not difficult if a patient has frequent, spontaneous panic attacks and agoraphobic symptoms, but many patients with GAD have occasional anxiety attacks or panic attacks. Such patients should be considered as having GAD. An even closer overlap probably exists between GAD and social phobia. Patients with clear-cut phobic avoidant behavior may be distinguished easily from patients with GAD, but patients with social anxiety without clear-cut phobic avoidant behavior may overlap with patients with GAD and possibly should be diagnosed as having GAD and not social phobia. The cardinal symptoms of GAD commonly overlap with those of social phobia, particularly if the social phobia is more general and not focused on a phobic situation. For example, free-floating anxiety may cause the hands to perspire and may cause a person to be shy in dealing with people in public, and thus many patients with subthreshold social phobic symptoms have, in the authors' opinion, GAD and not generalized social phobia. The distinction between GAD and obsessive-compulsive disorder, acute stress disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder should not be difficult by definition. At times, however, it may be difficult to distinguish between adjustment disorder with anxious mood from GAD or anxiety not otherwise specified, particularly if the adjustment disorder occurs in a patient with a high level of neuroticism or trait anxiety or type C personality disorder. Table 2 presents features distinguishing GAD from other psychiatric disorders. 2. Lifetime comorbid diagnoses of other anxiety or depression disorders, not active for 1 year or more and not necessitating treatment during that time period, should not effect a diagnosis of current GAD. On the other hand, if concomitant depressive symptoms are present and if these are subthreshold, a diagnosis of GAD should be made, and if these are full threshold, a diagnosis of MDD should be made. 3. If GAD is primary and if no such current comorbid diagnosis, such as other anxiety disorders or MDD, is present, except for minor depression and dysthymia, or if only subthreshold symptoms of other anxiety disorders are present, GAD should be considered primary and treated as GAD; however, patients with concurrent threshold anxiety or mood disorders should be diagnosed according to the definitions of these disorders in the DSM-IV and ICD-10 and treated as such. 4. Somatization disorders are now classified separately from anxiety disorders. Some of these, particularly undifferentiated somatization disorder, may overlap with GAD and be diagnostically difficult to distinguish. The authors believe that, as long as psychic symptoms of anxiety are present and predominant, patients should be given a primary diagnosis of GAD. 5. Two major shifts in the DSM diagnostic criteria for GAD have markedly redefined the definition of this disorder. One shift involves the duration criterion from 1 to 6 months, and the other, the increased emphasis on worry and secondary psychic [table: see text] symptoms accompanied by the elimination of most somatic symptoms. This decision has had the consequence of orphaning a large population of patients suffering from GAD that is more transient and somatic in its focus and who typically present not to psychiatrists but to primary care physicians. Therefore, clinicians should consider using the ICD-10 qualification of illness duration of "several months" to replace the more rigid DSM-IV criterion of 6 months and to move away from the DSM-IV focus on excessive worry as the cardinal symptom of anxiety and demote it to only another important anxiety symptom, similar to free-floating anxiety. One also might consider supplementing this ICD-10 criterion with an increased symptom severity criterion as, for example, a Hamilton Anxiety Scale of 18. Finally, the adjective excessive, not used in the definition of other primary diagnostic criteria, such as depressed mood for MDD, should be omitted (Table 3). 6. One may want to consider the distinction of trait (chronic) from state (acute) anxiety, but whether the presence of some personality characteristics, particularly anxious personality or Cluster C personality and increased neuroticism, as an indicator of trait [table: see text] anxiety is a prerequisite for anxiety disorders; occurs independently of anxiety disorders; or is a vulnerability factor that, in some patients, leads to anxiety symptoms and, in others, does not, is unknown. 7. Symptoms that some clinicians consider cardinal for a diagnosis of GAD, such as extreme worry, obsessive rumination, and somatization, also are present in other disorders, such as MDD.

### The genetic contribution to the comorbidity of depression and anxiety: a multi-site electronic health records study of almost 178 000 people [^ab4301f5]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Identifying cases with depression and anxiety

Depression and anxiety were defined using an initial list of ICD9/10-CM codes mapped to phecodes [i.e. higher order group of diagnoses, as described and validated by the Phecode map 1.2b1 (Denny et al.)] available from. (He et al; Wei et al.) These definitions were then modified through expert curation from the authors. Depression was defined as having at least two depression-related ICD9/10 codes, using an initial list of ICD9/10-CM codes mapped to the phecode for depression (296.2 and 296.22) (He et al; Wei et al.), with the addition of dysthymic disorder [ICD9:300.4; ICD10:F34.1], depressive type psychosis [ICD9:298.0], and atypical depressive disorder [ICD9:296.82]. Anxiety was defined as having at least two anxiety-related ICD9/10 codes, using an initial list of ICD9/10-CM codes mapped to phecodes for anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorders, social phobias and panic disorders, and phobias (300.1, 300.11, 300.12, 300.13, respectively) (He et al; Wei et al.) with the addition of separation anxiety disorder [ICD9: 309.21; ICD10: F93.0] and removing hysteria (ICD9: 300.1) and overanxious disorder (ICD9: 313). The complete list of ICD9/10-CM codes is presented in online Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. Patients with only one diagnostic code were excluded from all analyses and controls were patients who had no documented ICD codes for depression and anxiety disorders. No exclusions were made for diagnoses of other psychiatric disorders.

### Adult mental health consequences of peer bullying and maltreatment in childhood: two cohorts in two countries [^7c231814]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Assessment of outcome variables

We derived ICD-10 diagnoses of anxiety and depression at age 18 years from a reliable and validated self-administered computerised version of the Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R). The CIS-R enables diagnoses according to the ICD-10 for common mental disorders. Computer algorithms are used to identify common mental disorders according to ICD-10 diagnostic criteria. Anxiety was a binary variable indicating presence versus absence of any generalised anxiety disorder, social phobia, specific phobia, panic disorder, or agoraphobia. Similarly, responses to questions were aggregated by the specified algorithm to derive a binary variable of ICD-10 diagnosis of depression.

We assessed self-harm at 18 years from the CIS-R, with a binary variable coded from responses to the following two questions: "Have you ever hurt yourself on purpose in any way (eg, by taking an overdose of pills, or by cutting yourself)?" If yes, "How many times have you harmed yourself in the last year?" (not in the past year versus once, two-to-five times, six-to-ten times, or more than ten times).

We measured any DSM-IV anxiety disorder (generalised anxiety, agoraphobia, panic disorder, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder), depression, and suicidality (recurrent thoughts of wanting to die, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, suicidal plans or a suicide attempt) with the Young Adult Psychiatric Assessment (YAPA). Scoring programs, written in SAS 9.2, combined information about the date of onset, duration, and intensity of each symptom to create diagnoses according to the DSM-IV.2-week test-retest reliability of the YAPA is similar to that of other highly structured interviews (κ for individual disorders ranged from 0·56 to 1·0). Validity is well established using multiple indices of construct validity. Overall mental health problems (any depression, anxiety, or suicidality) were recorded through ages 19–25 years.

### Agoraphobia: a review of the diagnostic classificatory position and criteria [^12c56d95]. Depression and Anxiety (2010). Low credibility.

The status of agoraphobia (AG) as an independent diagnostic category is reviewed and preliminary options and recommendations for the fifth edition of The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-V) are presented. The review concentrates on epidemiology, psychopathology, neurobiology, vulnerability and risk factors, clinical course and outcome, and correlates and consequences of AG since 1990. Differences and similarities across conventions and criteria of DSM and ICD-10 are considered. Three core questions are addressed. First, what is the evidence for AG as a diagnosis independent of panic disorder? Second, should AG be conceptualized as a subordinate form of panic disorder (PD) as currently stipulated in DSM-IV-TR? Third, is there evidence for modifying or changing the current diagnostic criteria? We come to the conclusion that AG should be conceptualized as an independent disorder with more specific criteria rather than a subordinate, residual form of PD as currently stipulated in DSM-IV-TR. Among other issues, this conclusion was based on psychometric evaluations of the construct, epidemiological investigations which show that AG can exist independently of panic disorder, and the impact of agoraphobic avoidance upon clinical course and outcome. However, evidence from basic and clinic validation studies remains incomplete and partly contradictory. The apparent advantages of a more straightforward, simpler classification without implicit hierarchies and insufficiently supported differential diagnostic considerations, plus the option for improved further research, led to favoring the separate diagnostic criteria for AG as a diagnosis independent of panic disorder.

### ENIgMA-anxiety working group: rationale for and organization of large-scale neuroimaging studies of anxiety disorders [^09818764]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Although anxiety symptoms have long been described in literature on psychopathology, only more recent research emphasizes the construct of anxiety disorder diagnoses, including conditions such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and specific phobia (SP). The third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM‐III [1980]) and the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD‐10 [1990]) stimulated research on these diagnostic categories by providing operational diagnostic guidelines and criteria for specific anxiety disorders. Based on subsequent research, nosological constructs were refined and the overarching conceptualization of anxiety disorders was altered in DSM‐5 (2013) and ICD‐11 (2019). For example, both classification systems, unlike earlier schemes, now distinguish obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from anxiety disorders (Kogan et al.).

Important insights on the DSM and ICD constructs defining anxiety disorders came from community surveys. Serious mental illnesses are relatively common in clinical settings, but there is a relative under‐recognition of the symptomatology and need for treatment of anxiety disorders by clinicians (Aydin et al; Calleo et al; Chapdelaine, Carrier, Fournier, Duhoux, & Roberge; Edwards, Thind, Stranges, Chiu, & Anderson; Furmark; Ormel, Koeter, van den Brink, & van de Willige). However, research in community settings finds that anxiety disorders are the most prevalent group of mental disorders, with lifetime prevalence averaging approximately 11% globally (Kessler et al.), with even higher estimates in high‐income countries (Wittchen et al.). Anxiety disorders typically have an early age of onset and are accompanied by significant subsequent comorbidity of both physical and mental disorders, as well as by considerable burden for patients, relatives and society (Fineberg et al; Stein et al.). The Global Burden of Disease Study found that, in high‐income as well as low‐ and middle‐income regions, anxiety disorders are the sixth leading cause of disability, in terms of years lived with disability (Baxter, Vos, Scott, Ferrari, & Whiteford).

### The structure of common DSM-IV and ICD-10 mental disorders in the Australian general population [^6562bcab]. Psychological Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Patterns of co-occurrence among the common mental disorders may provide information about underlying dimensions of psychopathology. The aim of the current study was to determine which of four models best fits the pattern of co-occurrence between 10 common DSM-IV and 11 common ICD-10 mental disorders.

Method

Data were from the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being (NSMHWB), a large-scale community epidemiological survey of mental disorders. Participants consisted of a random population-based sample of 10641 community volunteers, representing a response rate of 78%. DSM-IV and ICD-10 mental disorder diagnoses were obtained using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), version 2.0. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to assess the relative fit of competing models.

Results

A hierarchical three-factor variation of a two-factor model demonstrated the best fit to the correlations among the mental disorders. This model included a distress factor with high loadings on major depression, dysthymia, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and neurasthenia (ICD-10 only); a fear factor with high loadings on social phobia, panic disorder, agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD); and an externalizing factor with high loadings on alcohol and drug dependence. The distress and fear factors were best conceptualized as subfactors of a higher order internalizing factor.

Conclusions

A greater focus on underlying dimensions of distress, fear and externalization is warranted.

### Should OCD be classified as an anxiety disorder in DSM-V? [^c881a5e5]. Depression and Anxiety (2010). Low credibility.

In DSM-III, DSM-III-R, and DSM-IV, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) was classified as an anxiety disorder. In ICD-10, OCD is classified separately from the anxiety disorders, although within the same larger category as anxiety disorders (as one of the "neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders"). Ongoing advances in our understanding of OCD and other anxiety disorders have raised the question of whether OCD should continue to be classified with the anxiety disorders in DSM-V. This review presents a number of options and preliminary recommendations to be considered for DSM-V. Evidence is reviewed for retaining OCD in the category of anxiety disorders, and for moving OCD to a separate category of obsessive-compulsive (OC)-spectrum disorders, if such a category is included in DSM-V. Our preliminary recommendation is that OCD be retained in the category of anxiety disorders but that this category also includes OC-spectrum disorders along with OCD. If this change is made, the name of this category should be changed to reflect this proposed change.

### Recent insight into the subtypes of social anxiety disorder [^f97b574d]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Systems for subtyping individuals with social anxiety disorder have been the focus of much research attention as a means to improve assessment and treatment of the disorder. This article highlights recent revisions to social anxiety disorder (SAD) subtypes from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) to DSM-V, reviewing empirical evidence that served as the impetus for the revisions. Recent research examining the validity of the DSM-V system and alternative subtyping systems is reviewed. Overall, there appears to be greater empirical support for a dimensional subtyping system. Concerns therefore remain with the DSM-V system, which retained a categorical system but replaced the previous subtypes with a subtype of individuals fearing only performance situations. Recommendations for future research are discussed, as well as alternate options for capturing the variability in SAD presentations, including the possibility of eliminating subtyping altogether.

### Erectile dysfunction in patients with anxiety disorders: a systematic review [^0a09906c]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Men with anxiety disorders have been identified as high risk of developing erectile dysfunction (ED). The aim of this review is to define the prevalence and severity of ED in the male anxiety disorder population. A literature search of three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and PsychINFO) and a grey literature registry was conducted. Inclusion criteria were studies that investigated adult males, documented diagnosis of anxiety disorders made by a qualified psychiatrist and use of a validated tool to diagnose ED such as International Index of Erectile Function or ICD-10/DSM-IV. The search yielded 1220 articles and 12 studies were selected. The anxiety disorders investigated were post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social phobia/social anxiety disorder and panic disorder. We found that the median [IQR] prevalence of ED was 20.0 [5.1–41.2]% and the median [IQR] International Index of Erectile Function-5 scores were 17.62 [13.88–20.88], indicating a mild to moderate severity. Our review suggests a high prevalence of ED in the anxiety disorder population and ED may be more severe in this cohort, therefore advocating this is an important clinical topic. However, the evidence is limited due to the high heterogeneity between the studies and more research is required in this field.

### Anxiety disorders [^1acd656d]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Anxiety disorders constitute the largest group of mental disorders in most western societies and are a leading cause of disability. The essential features of anxiety disorders are excessive and enduring fear, anxiety or avoidance of perceived threats, and can also include panic attacks. Although the neurobiology of individual anxiety disorders is largely unknown, some generalizations have been identified for most disorders, such as alterations in the limbic system, dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and genetic factors. In addition, general risk factors for anxiety disorders include female sex and a family history of anxiety, although disorder-specific risk factors have also been identified. The diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders varies for the individual disorders, but are generally similar across the two most common classification systems: the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition (ICD-10). Despite their public health significance, the vast majority of anxiety disorders remain undetected and untreated by health care systems, even in economically advanced countries. If untreated, these disorders are usually chronic with waxing and waning symptoms. Impairments associated with anxiety disorders range from limitations in role functioning to severe disabilities, such as the patient being unable to leave their home.

### Specific phobia of illness: search for a new subtype [^22e20995]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

Specific phobia of illness makes its appearance in DSM-IV as a new diagnostic subtype, separate from hypochondriasis. A review of the literature indicates that, while there is some support for this new category, studies have not as yet been done that could provide validation. Illness phobia appears to be a significant problem; it is prevalent in the general population and is associated with distress and impairment, including interference with medical care. It appears to be associated with older age, physical illness, and female gender. Group comparisons are needed showing that persons with this phobia can be distinguished from hypochondriasis on the basis of these and other demographic and illness features. We outline a research agenda for demonstrating this separation.

### The ICD-11 developmental field study of reliability of diagnoses of high-burden mental disorders: results among adult patients in mental health settings of 13 countries [^cdfb5ce5]. World Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Reliable, clinically useful, and globally applicable diagnostic classification of mental disorders is an essential foundation for global mental health. The World Health Organization (WHO) is nearing completion of the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11). The present study assessed inter-diagnostician reliability of mental disorders accounting for the greatest proportion of global disease burden and the highest levels of service utilization - schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, mood disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, and disorders specifically associated with stress - among adult patients presenting for treatment at 28 participating centers in 13 countries. A concurrent joint-rater design was used, focusing specifically on whether two clinicians, relying on the same clinical information, agreed on the diagnosis when separately applying the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines. A total of 1,806 patients were assessed by 339 clinicians in the local language. Intraclass kappa coefficients for diagnoses weighted by site and study prevalence ranged from 0.45 (dysthymic disorder) to 0.88 (social anxiety disorder) and would be considered moderate to almost perfect for all diagnoses. Overall, the reliability of the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines was superior to that previously reported for equivalent ICD-10 guidelines. These data provide support for the suitability of the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines for implementation at a global level. The findings will inform further revision of the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines prior to their publication and the development of programs to support professional training and implementation of the ICD-11 by WHO member states.

### The epidemiology of DSM-IV specific phobia in the USA: results from the national epidemiologic survey on alcohol and related conditions [^37ac2322]. Psychological Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

There is a lack of current detailed national data on the prevalence, correlates, disability and co-morbidity of DSM-IV specific phobia (SP), the prevalence of specific objects and situations feared, and associations between impairment, treatment and co-morbidity and the number of specific situations and objects feared, among adults in the USA.

Method

The data were derived from a large (43093) representative sample of the adult population in the USA.

Results

Prevalences of 12-month and lifetime DSM-IV SP were 7.1% and 9.4% respectively. Being female, young, and low income increased risk, while being Asian or Hispanic decreased risk (p < 0.05). The mean age at onset of SP was 9.7 years, the mean duration of episode was 20.1 years and only 8.0% reported treatment specifically for SP. Most specific phobias involved multiple fears, and an increasing number of fears, regardless of content, was associated with greater disability and impairment, treatment seeking and co-morbidity with other Axis I and II disorders.

Conclusions

SP is a highly prevalent, disabling and co-morbid disorder in the US adult population. The early onset of SP and the disorders most strongly associated with it highlights the need for longitudinal studies beginning in early childhood. Results suggest the existence of a generalized subtype of SP much like social phobia, which, once revealed, may lead to a classification of SP that is more etiologically and therapeutically meaningful.

Methods

Data collection and download

We obtained the data in this study from Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) 2021 public datasets available from. The 2021 GBD Study employs the most recent epidemiological data and improved standardized methodologies to deliver a comprehensive assessment of 369 diseases, injuries, and injury-related health effects, as well as 88 risk factors, across 204 countries and territories. Our analyses were limited to precise values of prevalence, incidence, and disability-adjusted life years and COVID-19 prevalence, incidence data associated with anxiety disorders and their 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). Furthermore, the study SDI, a metric that quantifies the sociodemographic development level of a region based on income, education, and fertility. Due to patient information desensitization in the GBD study, the Institutional Review Board of the University of Washington approved the waiver of informed consent.

Definition of anxiety and description of burden

Patients with anxiety disorders included in this study, they are characterized by excessive and persistent fear, anxiety disorders, or avoidance of perceived threats, and may also be accompanied by panic attacks. This classification is based on the diagnostic criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), and the International Classification of Diseases, Eleventh Edition (ICD-11), which encompass three levels: cognitive, emotional, and somatic. The key symptoms that classify anxiety disorders include separation anxiety disorders, selective mutism, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, and generalized anxiety disorder. In 2021, a comprehensive assessment was conducted to quantify the burden of anxiety disorders at the national level, focusing on prevalence, incidence, and disability-adjusted life years. The survey also examines the demographic variables that influence the prevalence of anxiety disorders and investigates the distribution of the disorder's burden across different age groups and genders.

### Social fears and social phobia in the USA: results from the national comorbidity survey replication [^6d68e3e8]. Psychological Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Despite heightened awareness of the clinical significance of social phobia, information is still lacking about putative subtypes, functional impairment, and treatment-seeking. New epidemiologic data on these topics are presented from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R).

Method

The NCS-R is a nationally representative household survey fielded in 2001–2003. The World Health Organization (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic Interview Version 3.0 (CIDI 3.0) was used to assess 14 performance and interactional fears and DSM-IV social phobia.

Results

The estimated lifetime and 12-month prevalence of social phobia are 12.1% and 7.1% respectively. Performance and interactional fears load onto a single latent factor, and there is little evidence for distinct subtypes based either on the content or the number of fears. Social phobia is associated with significant psychiatric co-morbidity, role impairment, and treatment-seeking, all of which have a dose-response relationship with number of social fears. However, social phobia is the focus of clinical attention in only about half of cases where treatment is obtained. Among non-co-morbid cases, those with the most fears were least likely to receive social phobia treatment.

Conclusions

Social phobia is a common, under-treated disorder that leads to significant functional impairment. Increasing numbers of social fears are associated with increasingly severe manifestations of the disorder.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of impairment and quality of life in children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^ac48267f]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Eligibility Criteria

Studies were eligible for this review if they were peer reviewed, published in English, and included a sample of children and/or adolescents with a mean age between 7 and 17 years, regardless of whether some participants fell outside of this specific range. Studies were required to include children and/or adolescents diagnosed with a primary anxiety disorder as defined by any version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric Association,) or the International Classification of Diseases (World Health Organization). Disorders categorized as anxiety disorders have changed across versions of the DSM and ICD. In our review, anxiety disorders included generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, separation anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, or selective mutism, as determined by a diagnostic interview or based on participants exceeding a clinical cut-off score on a validated measure. In previous versions of the DSM, both posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) were classified as anxiety disorders. In our study, we excluded studies that specifically focused on OCD or PTSD due to our assumption that these disorders would be associated with greater levels of impairment and lower QoL compared to DSM-5 anxiety disorders, thus potentially leading to an overestimation of the overall impact of anxiety disorders. However, we included studies if these disorders were part of a broader sample recruited for anxiety disorders, reflecting their classification at the time. Studies focused on participants with subclinical symptoms were excluded unless separate outcome data were available for clinical and subthreshold samples. We included studies where participants had other comorbid diagnoses (e.g. Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder, Illness Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder), provided the sample had a primary diagnosis of anxiety. We excluded studies that focused on samples where every participant had a specific homogenous co-occurring psychiatric or physical health diagnosis in addition to anxiety (e.g. autism, intellectual/learning disabilities, asthma). However, if a study did not deliberately select for co-occurring diagnoses but included participants who happened to have them (as long as the primary focus was on anxiety and not all participants had the co-occurring condition), these studies were considered eligible. We considered studies across all design types (e.g. longitudinal, psychometric evaluation, national survey data), as long as they compared participants with clinical anxiety to a healthy comparison group. Healthy control samples could be established either by confirming the absence of any psychiatric or physical diagnosis in the group or by showing no indicators of these diagnoses based on the study's screening methods. The outcomes of interest were impairment and QoL. To be included in the meta-analyses, studies had to report the means and standard deviations (SDs) for one or more of these outcomes or provide data that would allow us to compute the relevant statistics.

Chronic conditions

Self-reported

The presence of SR chronic conditions was ascertained based on participants' answers (yes/no) to the following question, "To your knowledge, and according to a physician, do you have". Briefly, participants were invited to inform if they had been diagnosed with one or more chronic conditions out of a list of 15: dermatologic conditions, arthropathy, cancer, headaches, diabetes, liver disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease/atherosclerosis, eye diseases, respiratory tract disease (i.e. bronchitis, asthma, emphysema, persistent cough), chronic urinary tract problem, thyroid problems, gastrointestinal diseases, and musculoskeletal conditions (i.e. chronic neck/back pain). Moreover, the presence of depressive and anxiety symptoms was ascertained using the ESA-S Q Mental-Diagnostic Module based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM- 5) and other literature sources. The presence of depressive (major, minor and subclinical) and anxiety (specific phobia, social phobia, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder — GAD) conditions was then defined. We defined common mental health disorders as the presence of anxiety and/or depressive conditions. Last, participants were also asked to report their weight and height so that their body mass index (BMI) could be calculated and self-reported obesity (defined as a BMI ≥ 30) ascertained.

Physician diagnosis based on administrative records

Two health-Adm databases (RAMQ medical services claim-based and MED-ÉCHO hospital stay) were used to identify participants' chronic conditions. The ICD-9/ICD-10 codes were used to extract information from these databases (over a three-year period prior to the interview) for each of the 17 conditions reported by the participants. The selection of the ICD-9/10 codes was mostly guided by a list proposed by a group of experts from the International Research Community on Multimorbidity (IRCMo). This list was also completed by literature review in the case of disease categories that were not included in the expert group's list (e.g. eye disease, dermatologic disease and chronic headaches). An additional table shows the list of 17 chronic condition categories and the corresponding ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes (see Additional file 1).

Combined data sources

Each of the 17 chronic conditions was also assessed using combined data sources (either SR or Adm).

Study characteristics

Of the 12 included studies, five were cross-sectional, three case–controls and four retrospective cohort studies. Six studies evaluated PTSD and two OCD, of which one also looked at SAD, and four looked at panic disorder. Studies were published between 2001 and 2019 with a total of 713,746 participants. In all, 113,850 participants were diagnosed with an anxiety disorder investigated in this review by a clinician, with 111,091 diagnosed with PTSD, 33 with OCD, 2594 with panic disorder and for SAD it was 34. Sample sizes varied from 10 to 110,223. We also found that there were 406,616 veterans in the total study population across all studies.

Although we searched for studies which used IIEF-5, SHIM and EHS, all seven of the prospective studies that were selected used IIEF-5 to measure erectile function, whereas the remaining five retrospective studies use ICD-9 or DSM-IV codes to search the patient medical records to identify patients with ED. Detailed characteristics of all included studies are presented in Table 1.

### The development of the ICD-11 clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines for mental and behavioural disorders [^d4a0214a]. World Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization is in the process of preparing the eleventh revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), scheduled for presentation to the World Health Assembly for approval in 2017. The International Advisory Group for the Revision of the ICD-10 Mental and Behavioural Disorders made improvement in clinical utility an organizing priority for the revision. The uneven nature of the diagnostic information included in the ICD-10 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines (CDDG), especially with respect to differential diagnosis, is a major shortcoming in terms of its usefulness to clinicians. Consequently, ICD-11 Working Groups were asked to collate diagnostic information about the disorders under their purview using a standardized template (referred to as a "Content Form"). Using the information provided in the Content Forms as source material, the ICD-11 CDDG are being developed with a uniform structure. The effectiveness of this format in producing more consistent clinical judgments in ICD-11 as compared to ICD-10 is currently being tested in a series of Internet-based field studies using standardized case material, and will also be tested in clinical settings.

Anxiety disorders and obsessive–compulsive disorder

Ymkje Anna de Vries (Fig. 8), Annelieke M. Roest (Fig. 9), Peter de Jonge (Fig. 10)

Anxiety disorders form a heterogeneous group defined by the presence of anxiety states such as worry, fear, or panic. They are characterized by a chronic course and an early age of onset. Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) shares some of these characteristics and has previously been considered an anxiety disorder (e.g. in the DSM-IV). We therefore discuss it alongside anxiety disorders.

In the ICD-11, the classification of anxiety disorders has been simplified and brought into better agreement with an evidence-based Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP). This model proposes several higher-order dimensions, including internalizing and externalizing dimensions, and aims to give an aetiological account of mental disorders. The internalizing dimension is proposed to consist of several subdomains, including fear (e.g. phobia) and distress (e.g. generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder). The ICD-10 grouped most anxiety disorders and OCD into the heterogeneous grouping of 'neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders' (F40–F48), and also split anxiety disorders into 'phobic anxiety disorders' and 'other anxiety disorders' (GAD, mixed anxiety disorders, and panic disorder). While this split may have some face validity, factor analytic models generally find that panic disorder clusters with phobic disorders into the fear subdomain of internalizing disorders.

### Recognition of irrationality of fear and the diagnosis of social anxiety disorder and specific phobia in adults: implications for criteria revision in DSM-5 [^6e590b9c]. Depression and Anxiety (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In DSM-IV, the diagnosis of social anxiety disorder (SAD) and specific phobia in adults requires that the person recognize that his or her fear of the phobic situation is excessive or unreasonable (criterion C). The DSM-5 Anxiety Disorders Work Group has proposed replacing this criterion because some patients with clinically significant phobic fears do not recognize the irrationality of their fears. In the present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services project we determined the number of individuals who were not diagnosed with SAD and specific phobia because they did not recognize the excessiveness or irrationality of their fear.

Methods

We interviewed 3,000 psychiatric outpatients and 1,800 candidates for bariatric surgery with a modified version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. In the SAD and specific phobia modules we suspended the skip-out that curtails the modules if criterion C is not met. Patients who met all DSM-IV criteria for SAD or specific phobia except criterion C were considered to have "modified" SAD or specific phobia.

Results

The lifetime rates of DSM-IV SAD and specific phobia were 30.5 and 11.8% in psychiatric patients and 11.7 and 10.2% in bariatric surgery candidates, respectively. Less than 1% of the patients in both samples were diagnosed with modified SAD or specific phobia.

Conclusion

Few patients were excluded from a phobia diagnosis because of criterion C. We suggest that in DSM-5 this criterion be eliminated from the SAD and specific phobia criteria sets.

2.2. Disease Definition

According to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), anxiety disorders, as defined by The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR) and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) diagnostic criteria, are characterized by intense fear, distress, and physiological symptoms that result in disability. Specific anxiety disorders are classified under DSM-IV-TR codes 300.0–300.3, 208.3, 309.21, 309.81, and ICD-10 codes F40-42, F43.0, F43.1, F93.0–93.2, and F93.8. This study evaluated the overall burden of anxiety disorders collectively, rather than analyzing individual subtypes.

2.3. Statistical Analysis

2.3.1. Burden Description

Using the GBD world population age standard, direct standardization was applied to individuals aged 1 year and older with anxiety disorders to account for population age structure and allow for consistent comparisons of disease burden across years and locations. The age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) denotes the number of incident cases per 100,000 population, the age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR) indicates the number of existing cases per 100,000 population, and the age-standardized YLDs rate (ASYR) represents the YLDs per 100,000 population. This study reported the distribution of ASIR, ASPR, and ASYR by sex across the globe, five SDI regions, six WHO regions, and 204 countries/territories from 1992 to 2021.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^8a3cd4b0]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Children and adolescents with anxiety disorders — prevalence and onset data indicate that anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents; at any given time, nearly 7% of youths worldwide have an anxiety disorder, with estimated lifetime prevalence in the United States approximating 20% to 30%. Among youths 13 to 18 years old, lifetime prevalence rates approximate 20% for specific phobia, 9% for social anxiety, 8% for separation anxiety, and 2% each for agoraphobia, panic, and generalized anxiety. The median age of onset approximates 11 years, and onsets often occur during specific developmental phases: separation anxiety during the preschool/early school-age years, specific phobia in the school-age years, social anxiety in the later school-age and early adolescent years, and generalized anxiety, panic, and agoraphobia in the later adolescent/young adult years. Anxiety disorders (especially generalized anxiety) are highly comorbid with each other and with other psychiatric disorders, and for comorbid occurrences, multifaceted treatment plans likely are necessary.

### Should OCD leave the anxiety disorders in DSM-V? The case for obsessive compulsive-related disorders [^e54a0249]. Depression and Anxiety (2008). Low credibility.

Recently in 2006, a group of experts in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and obsessive compulsive-related disorders (OCRDs) convened in Washington, DC, to review existing data on the relationships between these various disorders, and to suggest approaches to address the gaps in our knowledge, in preparation for the upcoming Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (Fifth Edition) (DSM-V). As a result of this meeting, the Research Planning Agenda for DSM-V: OCRD Work Group suggested removing OCD from the anxiety disorders, where it is currently found. This proposal is in accordance with the current International Classification of Mental Disorders (ICD-10) classification of OCD as a separate category from the anxiety disorders. Although the ICD-10 places both OCD and the anxiety disorders under the umbrella category of "neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders", they are two separate categories, distinct from one another. As OCD and other putative OCRDs share aspects of phenomenology, comorbidity, neurotransmitter/peptide systems, neurocircuitry, familial and genetic factors, and treatment response, it was proposed to create a new category in DSM-V entitled OCRDs. Alternatively, the OCRDs might be conceptualized as a new category within the broader category of anxiety disorders. Future studies are needed to better define the relationships among these disorders, and to study boundary issues for this proposed category. There are both advantages and disadvantages in creating a new diagnostic category in DSM-V, and these are discussed in this article.

### Anxiety disorders, benzodiazepine prescription, and incident dementia [^79d75e1c]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Prescribing benzodiazepines to older patients is controversial. Anxiety disorders and benzodiazepines have been associated with dementia, but literature is inconsistent. It is unknown if anxiety treated with a benzodiazepine, compared to anxiety disorder alone is associated with dementia risk.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study (n = 72,496) was conducted using electronic health data from 2014 to 2021. Entropy balancing controlled for bias by indication and other confounding factors.

Participants

Eligible patients were ≥ 65years old, had clinic encounters before and after index date and were free of dementia for 2years prior to index date. Of the 72,496 eligible patients, 85.6% were White and 59.9% were female. Mean age was 74.1 (SD ± 7.1) years.

Exposure

Anxiety disorder was a composite of generalized anxiety disorder, anxiety not otherwise specified, panic disorder, and social phobia. Sustained benzodiazepine use was defined as at least two separate prescription orders in any 6-month period.

Main Outcome and Measures

ICD-9 or ICD-10 dementia diagnoses.

Results

Six percent of eligible patients had an anxiety diagnosis and 3.6% received sustained benzodiazepine prescriptions. There were 6640 (9.2%) incident dementia events. After controlling for confounders, both sustained benzodiazepine use (HR 1.28, 95% CI: 1.11–1.47) and a diagnosis of anxiety (HR 1.19, 95% CI: 1.06–1.33) were associated with incident dementia in patients aged 65–75. Anxiety disorder with sustained benzodiazepine, compared to anxiety disorder alone, was not associated with incident dementia (HR 1.18, 95% CI: 0.92–1.51) after controlling for confounding. Results were not significant when limiting the sample to those ≥ 75years of age.

Conclusions

Benzodiazepines and anxiety disorders are associated with increased risk for dementia. In patients with anxiety disorders, benzodiazepines were not associated with additional dementia risk. Further research is warranted to determine if benzodiazepines are associated with a reduced or increased risk for dementia compared to other anxiolytic medications in patients with anxiety disorders.

### The cross-national epidemiology of social anxiety disorder: data from the world mental health survey initiative [^5bb4e4a3]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Comorbidity

Table 6 shows that respondents with either lifetime or 12-month SAD are most likely to meet lifetime criteria for other anxiety disorders (59.8% and 64.9%), less likely to meet lifetime criteria for mood and substance use disorders, and least likely to meet lifetime criteria for impulse control disorders (19.3% and 21.9%); in both cases around 80% of such respondents meet lifetime criteria for any other mental disorder. Similarly, respondents with 12-month SAD are most likely to meet 12-month criteria for other anxiety disorders (52.7%), less likely to meet 12-month criteria for mood and impulse control disorders, and least likely to meet 12-month criteria for substance use disorders (10.2%); with 66.9% of such respondents meeting 12-month criteria for any other disorder. For both lifetime and 12-month SAD, SAD begins earlier in only 31.4–35.4% of cases of anxiety disorder, but SAD begins earlier in 48.8–80.9% of cases of mood disorder, substance use disorder, or impulse control disorder.

2 Methods and materials

2.1 Participants

Based on the sample sizes of previous eye-tracking studies in social phobia (e.g.,) as well as our experience with the experimental paradigm, we aimed at recruiting a minimum of 20 participants for each group. Since eye-tracking measures between factor levels are substantially correlated (r > 0.70 in our previous studies, e.g.), the power for detecting medium effects (f = 0.25) in interactions between group and within-subject factors is larger than 0.90.

In total, 22 patients with social phobia and 22 healthy controls carefully matched with respect to age, gender and education participated in this study. Initially, 24 patients and 24 controls were recruited. One patient was excluded because of acute psychotic symptoms and another one because he was illiterate and unable to complete the questionnaires. Additionally, two control participants had to be replaced because they reached high values on the social anxiety questionnaires (see Section 3.1). Patients were recruited when seeking treatment from the psychotherapeutic outpatient clinic Falkenried in Hamburg, Germany. All of them had a primary diagnosis of social phobia (ICD-10; see Table 1 and Supplement for further details on the sample), which was established during an initial interview by a clinically trained psychologist who checked relevant ICD-10 criteria for social phobia as well as potential comorbid disorders. This interview was conducted in a similar manner (standardized operating procedures of the respective outpatient clinic) for all participants and diagnoses were verified in a second interview by the clinically trained psychologist who was responsible for organizing further treatment. Participants in the control group were recruited via advertisement and screened for any current or past psychiatric symptoms using the MINI-international neuropsychiatric interview. Four of the social phobia subjects were on medication, including three on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (escitalopram and citalopram), one on a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (venlafaxine) and two of them were additionally treated with anticonvulsant drugs (pregabalin). All patients and controls had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and gave written informed consent as approved by the local ethics committee of the Medical Board in Hamburg, Germany.

### Culture and the anxiety disorders: recommendations for DSM-V [^095c7a1d]. Depression and Anxiety (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The anxiety disorders specified in the fourth edition, text revision, of The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR) are identified universally in human societies, and also show substantial cultural particularities in prevalence and symptomatology. Possible explanations for the observed epidemiological variability include lack of measurement equivalence, true differences in prevalence, and limited validity or precision of diagnostic criteria. One central question is whether, through inadvertent "over-specification" of disorders, the post-DSM-III nosology has missed related but somewhat different presentations of the same disorder because they do not exactly fit specified criteria sets. This review canvases the mental health literature for evidence of cross-cultural limitations in DSM-IV-TR anxiety disorder criteria.

Methods

Searches were conducted of the mental health literature, particularly since 1994, regarding cultural or race/ethnicity-related factors that might limit the universal applicability of the diagnostic criteria for six anxiety disorders.

Results

Possible mismatches between the DSM criteria and the local phenomenology of the disorder in specific cultural contexts were found for three anxiety disorders in particular. These involve the unexpectedness and 10-minute crescendo criteria in Panic Disorder; the definition of social anxiety and social reference group in Social Anxiety Disorder; and the priority given to psychological symptoms of worry in Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Limited evidence was found throughout, particularly in terms of neurobiological markers, genetic risk factors, treatment response, and other DSM-V validators that could help clarify the cross-cultural applicability of criteria.

Conclusions

On the basis of the available data, options and preliminary recommendations for DSM-V are put forth that should be further evaluated and tested.

### CLINICAL PRACTICE. generalized anxiety disorder [^ac79ac21]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on generalized anxiety disorder:

- **Definition**: GAD is a chronic disorder characterized by excessive anxiety and worry about a number of events or activities (such as work, home, and social) symptoms, and tension, which an individual finds difficult to control.
- **Pathophysiology**: GAD is mostly caused by genetic (altered DNA methylation and single nucleotide polymorphism) and environmental factors (stress, trauma, etc.).
- **Epidemiology**: The lifetime prevalence of DSM-5 GAD in the US is estimated at 7,800 cases per 100,000 individuals.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include restless feeling, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbance, arguments with relatives or friends, difficulty/inability to complete tasks, restriction of usual activities, with associated autonomic, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary symptoms decreasing the overall health of the individual. GAD is associated with various comorbidities including depression, dysthymia, bipolar I and II, panic disorder with/without agoraphobia, social phobia, specific phobia, substance use disorder, and personality disorders (avoidant, dependent, obsessive-compulsive, paranoid, schizoid, and antisocial).
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Anxiety disorders are associated with an increased risk of death with a natural mortality rate ratio of 1.39 (95% CI 1.28–1.51) and an unnatural mortality rate ratio of 2.46 (95% CI 2.20–2.73).

### Disease clusters subsequent to anxiety and stress-related disorders and their genetic determinants [^0a2d4d1d]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Follow-up

To minimize the concern of reverse causality, we followed all participants of the Swedish cohort for all medical conditions from 6 months after the index date until death, first diagnosis of anxiety or stress-related disorders (for matched unexposed individuals), emigration, or the end of the study period (i.e. 31 December 2016), whichever occurred first.

Ascertainment of anxiety and stress-related disorders and subsequent medical conditions

In the Swedish cohort, we defined anxiety or stress-related disorders as any first specialist care diagnosis in an inpatient or outpatient hospital visit, where these disorders were identified as the primary discharge diagnosis, according to the Swedish Patient Register, using the 10th Swedish revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes (anxiety: F40 and F41, stress-related disorder: F43) (Supplementary Table 1). In the PheWAS, medical conditions refer to any disease or health outcomes recorded in the Patient Register comprising inpatient and outpatient diagnoses. We ascertained medical conditions through the primary diagnosis from the Patient Register, using the 3-digit ICD-10 codes (A00 to N99) (Supplementary Table 1). The diagnostic codes for most common diseases in the Patient Register have been validated, showing a satisfactory accuracy with positive predicted values [PPV] of 85–95% for most common diseases, 81% for social anxiety disorder, and 75–90% for PTSD. We obtained the highest level of education and income at the year of index date from the Swedish Longitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance and Labor Market.

### A cluster analysis of early onset in common anxiety disorders [^035702e0]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Early onset is regarded as an important characteristic of anxiety disorders, associated with higher severity. However, previous findings diverge, as definitions of early onset vary and are often unsubstantiated. We objectively defined early onset in social phobia, panic disorder, agoraphobia, and generalised anxiety disorder, using cluster analysis with data gathered in the general population. Resulting cut-off ages for early onset were ≤ 22 (social phobia), ≤ 31 (panic disorder), ≤ 21 (agoraphobia), and ≤ 27 (generalised anxiety disorder). Comparison of psychiatric comorbidity and general wellbeing between subjects with early and late onset in the general population and an outpatient cohort, demonstrated that among outpatients anxiety comorbidity was more common in early onset agoraphobia, but also that anxiety- as well as mood comorbidity were more common in late onset social phobia. A major limitation was the retrospective assessment of onset. Our results encourage future studies into correlates of early onset of psychiatric disorders.

The primary outcome variables for the second stage of the study were the binary variables of any SUD-related emergency admissions or drug-related poisoning. SUD-related emergency admissions were coded using ICD-9/ICD-10 codes encompassing any non-tobacco-related SUD, primary or otherwise (291.xx, 292.xx, 303.xx, 304.xx, 305.xx except for 305.1, F10-F16, F18-F19), including accidents, poisonings and overdoses. Drug-related poisoning was coded using ICD-9/ICD-10 codes recorded in medical claims based on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's codes for drug-related poisoning (online supplemental eTable 1 for full codes). We coded PSUD (primary predictor variable) using ICD-9/ICD-10 diagnostic codes obtained during a 6-month lookback period preceding and including the date of buprenorphine initiation.

Detailed information about other co-occurring psychiatric and SUDs were also obtained in the 6-month lookback period preceding and including the date of buprenorphine initiation. Covariates for our analyses in stage 1 included age at start of buprenorphine (in years), and ICD-9/ICD-10 diagnostic codes for: mood disorder (depression or bipolar disorder), anxiety disorders (composite of post-traumatic stress disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, social anxiety, anxiety disorder unspecified) or co-occurring SUDs (alcohol, cannabis, sedative-hypnotics (benzodiazepines, Z-drugs), tobacco).

### A comparison of DSM-5 and DSM-IV agoraphobia in the world mental health surveys [^66f33732]. Depression and Anxiety (2019). Medium credibility.

In DSM ‐5, which was introduced in 2013, AG is defined as a phobic disorder cued by exposure to agoraphobic situations. As a result, PD (300.01) and AG (300.22) are unlinked (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Asmundson, Taylor, & Smits, 2014), consistent with the ICD‐10 criteria for AG (F40.0) and PD (F41.0; World Health Organization, 2016). The decision to classify AG as a disorder that exists separately from PD was based on studies indicating that a substantial proportion of individuals with AG do not have PD (Kessler et al. 2006; Wittchen, Gloster, Beesdo‐Baum, Fava, & Craske, 2010), and/or PD or panic attacks do not precede AG (as implied in DSM ‐IV; Wittchen et al. 2010, 2008; Wittchen, Reed, & Kessler, 1998). As a result, individuals with AG, but without panic‐like symptoms, received no formal diagnosis while they showed substantial impairment and disability (Wittchen et al. 2010). Further, DSM ‐5 criterion A is broadened to a fear or avoidance of situations because of thoughts that escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of developing panic‐like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms (e.g. fear of falling in the elderly; fear of incontinence; American Psychiatric Association, 2013). This is in line with the ICD criteria, in which AG is understood to be the consequence of a broader range of fears (Kogan et al. 2016; Stein, 2012; Wittchen et al. 2010). To make a better distinction from specific phobia (SP), endorsement of fears from two or more distinct situational domains is required in DSM ‐5. Finally, the DSM ‐5 criteria for AG are extended compared to the DSM ‐IV criteria to make them more comparable to other (anxiety) disorders, for instance by adding persistence and severity requirements (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Asmundson et al. 2014).

### A comparison of DSM-5 and DSM-IV agoraphobia in the world mental health surveys [^3eb70480]. Depression and Anxiety (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and are major contributors to the burden of disease worldwide (Craske et al. 2017; Murray et al. 2012; Whiteford et al. 2013). Agoraphobia (AG) is one of the least studied anxiety disorders (Asmundson & Asmundson, 2018), and, especially with the introduction of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, version 5 (DSM ‐5), there is a lack of research focusing on AG including the cross‐national epidemiology of AG.

In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, version 4 (DSM ‐IV), unlike the International Classification of Diseases (ICD‐10), AG was not defined as an independent disorder with specific diagnostic criteria, but instead was described as a residual group only to be coded in the presence or absence of panic disorder (PD; i.e. PD with AG [300.21], or AG without a history of PD [300.22]; American Psychiatric Association, 2000). AG was defined as anxiety about being in places or situations from which escape might be difficult (or embarrassing) or in which help may not be available in the event of having a panic attack or panic‐like symptoms. These situations had to be avoided, endured with marked distress or with anxiety about having a panic attack or panic‐like symptoms, or require the presence of a companion (American Psychiatric Association, 2000).

### Medical expenditures associated with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder among adults in the United States by age, 2015–2019 [^45be8855]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Measures

The dependent variables for this study were the direct overall medical expenditures and the service specific medical expenditures. This included hospital stays, outpatient care, emergency room visits, physician office visits, home care visits, and prescription medication. Household members were asked about which medical services each family member used and the corresponding medical costs that occurred. These costs included respondents' out of pocket payments and payments from private/public health insurance but did not include over-the-counter drugs, as these were not collected by MEPS. Following the guidelines recommend by AHRQ, costs were inflated to the recent estimate of the 2019-dollar value using the Personal Health Care Price Indices.

From the literature, two groups of variables, patient characteristics and medical conditions, were identified as potential predictors of the medical expenditures of ADHD. Patient characteristics included age, gender, race/ethnicity, geographic region, marital status, employment status, education, poverty, and insurance type. Depending on the year the data was collected, medical conditions were defined using ICD-10-CM codes or the clinical classification codes generated from Clinical Classification Software (CCS). Medical conditions included an adapted Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), asthma (CCS = 128 or ICD-10 = J45), anxiety disorders (anxiety, social phobia, and obsessive–compulsive disorder) (CCS = 651 or ICD-10 = F40/F41), and mood disorders (depression, bipolar) (CCS = 657 or ICD-10 = J31/J32). The CCI is a commonly used method of categorizing medical comorbidities of patients based on their ICD codes. The CCI score was calculated using Stata's Charlson package, which is based on the adaptations of Deyo and Quan to accommodate ICD-9-CM codes and ICD-10-CM codes. – For this study, the CCI was grouped into 3 categories: 0, 1, ≥ 2. Asthma was included as a covariate in the model due the high comorbidity found between ADHD and asthma. Although the exact nature of the association is not fully understood, numerous studies have observed the association in adults and children, and in population and clinical settings. Anxiety disorders and mood disorders have also been found to have a significant association with ADHD in adults and were thus included in the final model. Alcohol- and drug-related abuse were not adjusted in the model as previous research found that ADHD generally precedes these behaviors, and that ADHD can contribute to their development.

### Sex is a defining feature of neuroimaging phenotypes in major brain disorders [^0e2c8a2e]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

4.2 Anxiety disorders

In the current version of the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM‐5), nine distinct conditions are recognized as anxiety disorders: (a) generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), (b) social anxiety disorder, (c) separation anxiety disorder, (d) panic disorder (PaD), (e) specific phobia, (f) agoraphobia, (g) selective mutism, (h) anxiety disorders due to substance use, and (i) anxiety disorders due to another medical condition. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health conditions worldwide (Ritchie & Roser,), affecting over 3 million individuals in 2019 (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)). The nosology of anxiety disorders has evolved over the past decade, particularly with the transition from version 4 to version 5 of the DSM in 2013. Importantly, previously categorized anxiety disorders such as PTSD and obsessive compulsive disorders (OCD) are now recognized as independent diagnostic conditions in the DSM‐5. This has complicated the global picture of sex differences in psychiatric disease prevalences, as other diagnostic systems (e.g. International Classification of Diseases‐10) do not distinguish OCD and PTSD from other anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, most anxiety disorders are more common in females than males (Bekker & van Mens‐Verhulst; Jalnapurkar, Allen, & Pigott; McLean, Asnaani, Litz, & Hofmann).

Here, we focus on GAD and PaD, two of the most common anxiety disorders in adults. Social anxiety disorders and specific phobias affect a greater proportion of the population than GAD and PaD (Kessler, Chiu, Demler, Merikangas, & Walters; McLean et al.) but are primarily linked to childhood/developmental origins (de Lijster et al.). As such, we focus on anxiety disorders with adult onset to maintain a clear and concise narrative.

### In search of social phobia subtypes: similarity of feared social situations [^0f09811c]. Depression and Anxiety (2003). Low credibility.

The existence of subtypes of social phobia has been questioned. Although cluster analytic methods have been used to support various subtype models, a continuous model based on total number of feared social situations seems equally plausible. In a community sample, we calculated mean similarity measures for combinations of item pairs of feared social situations. Speaking fear items were significantly more similar to each other than to other items. There was also a trend for interaction fear items to be more similar to each other than to other items. These findings suggest that fear of speaking and interactional situations may represent distinct domains of socially feared situations. They should be considered separately in delineation of treatment response and may, if replicated in clinical samples, help identify meaningful subtypes of social phobia.

### Subtyping social anxiety disorder in developed and developing countries [^0cdf2f6e]. Depression and Anxiety (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Although social anxiety disorder (SAD) is classified in the fourth edition of The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) into generalized and non-generalized subtypes, community surveys in Western countries find no evidence of disjunctions in the dose-response relationship between number of social fears and outcomes to support this distinction. We aimed to determine whether this holds across a broader set of developed and developing countries, and whether subtyping according to number of performance versus interactional fears would be more useful.

Methods

The World Health Organization's World Mental Health Survey Initiative undertook population epidemiological surveys in 11 developing and 9 developed countries, using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview to assess DSM-IV disorders. Fourteen performance and interactional fears were assessed. Associations between number of social fears in SAD and numerous outcomes (age-of-onset, persistence, severity, comorbidity, treatment) were examined. Additional analyses examined associations with number of performance fears versus number of interactional fears.

Results

Lifetime social fears are quite common in both developed (15.9%) and developing (14.3%) countries, but lifetime SAD is much more common in the former (6.1%) than latter (2.1%) countries. Among those with SAD, persistence, severity, comorbidity, and treatment have dose-response relationships with number of social fears, with no clear nonlinearity in relationships that would support a distinction between generalized and non-generalized SAD. The distinction between performance fears and interactional fears is generally not important in predicting these same outcomes.

Conclusion

No evidence is found to support subtyping SAD on the basis of either number of social fears or number of performance fears versus number of interactional fears.

### International classification of diseases (ICD-11) and neurologic disorders: the future [^cd55411e]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

When the WHO's Topic Advisory Group for Neurology (TAG) started work on revision of the ICD-10 diagnostic codes in June 2009, the issues were daunting. The existing classification was produced a generation ago and the need to move to the digital age was becoming imperative. Appreciating modern advances in genetics and immunology, and the consequent changes in understanding of the pathophysiology of disorders of the nervous system, WHO's charge to the TAG was to produce a comprehensive, up-to-date disease classification, while providing published or consensus evidence for each coding change. In addition, the task would be to focus on ways to reduce the treatment gap while considering the utility of ICD-11 when used in primary care and nonspecialist settings. The project mushroomed over the 3 years since our first meeting and continues to do so. The work was made even more difficult as the group needed to add "content models" for the major codes for the first time (i.e., providing a definition for each disorder, along with appropriate diagnostic tests and outcome). The ICD-11 is meant to be updated as new knowledge develops, rather than waiting some years for another whole-scale revision, but this process has yet to be defined.

### Paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrous [^6e95f9ec]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Social Anxiety Disorder

Paroxetine tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of social anxiety disorder, also known as social phobia, as defined in DSM-IV (300.23). Social anxiety disorder is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of 1 or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others. Exposure to the feared situation almost invariably provokes anxiety, which may approach the intensity of a panic attack. The feared situations are avoided or endured with intense anxiety or distress. The avoidance, anxious anticipation, or distress in the feared situation(s) interferes significantly with the person's normal routine, occupational or academic functioning, or social activities or relationships, or there is marked distress about having the phobias. Lesser degrees of performance anxiety or shyness generally do not require psychopharmacological treatment.

The efficacy of paroxetine was established in three 12-week trials in adult patients with social anxiety disorder (DSM-IV). Paroxetine has not been studied in children or adolescents with social phobia (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials).

The effectiveness of paroxetine in long-term treatment of social anxiety disorder, i.e., for more than 12 weeks, has not been systematically evaluated in adequate and well-controlled trials. Therefore, the physician who elects to prescribe paroxetine for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Ready or not! here comes ICD-10 [^7cb0ab4c]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) is a new system that is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on 16 January 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of 1 October 2013. While ICD-9 and ICD-10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains more than 141 000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the < 20 000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion and expense. Published statistics illustrate that there are instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 distinct ICD-10 codes. Also, there are multiple instances where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of healthcare whereas detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25 000 to $50 000.

### Exploring the genetic link between thyroid dysfunction and common psychiatric disorders: a specific hormonal or a general autoimmune comorbidity [^799b8b6e]. Thyroid (2023). Medium credibility.

For a broader definition of thyroid disease patients, and especially for including those patients who never received in-patient treatment and were diagnosed by general practitioners, we used self-reported diagnoses in U.K. biobank (data field 20002). We further used the self-reported medication field (data field 20003), which records those medications that individuals were actively taking at the time of verbal interview with U.K. biobank. For hypothyroidism, we considered medication codes for levothyroxine sodium (1141191044), thyroxine sodium (1140874852), thyroxine product (1140884516), and sodium thyroxine (1140910814). For hyperthyroidism, we considered carbimazole (1140874866), propylthiouracil (1140874776), and propylthiouracil product (1141157288).

In the current work, we considered three common psychiatric disorders, including MDD, BIP, and ANX. These phenotypes were extracted from various data fields and questionnaires similar to previous studies. For selecting MDD subjects, we combined data fields 2090 and 2100: seen doctor (GP) or psychiatrist for nerves, anxiety, tension, or depression and in-patient ICD-10 codes (data field 41202).

For ANX, we used data field 20544: Mental health problems ever diagnosed by a professional, and included codes for social anxiety or social phobia, any other phobia (e.g. disabling fear of heights or spiders), panic attacks, anxiety, nerves or generalized ANX, and agoraphobia. Using the same data field, subjects were removed from the anxiety group if they reported schizophrenia, mania, hypomania, bipolar or manic-depression, Asperger's or autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit or attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and bulimia nervosa, psychological overeating or binge eating.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^079d657e]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Evaluation and diagnostic criteria — Clinically significant anxiety must be distinguished from everyday worries and fears that are common and normative in specific developmental stages, and in DSM-5 mental disorders are defined as "a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning". By DSM convention, a mental disorder is diagnosed if all or a threshold of diagnostic criteria for the given disorder are met, and included in most diagnostic criteria sets is the requirement for a specific frequency and duration of symptoms as well as clinically significant distress and functional impairment, along with the caveat that alternative mental, medical, and substance-related explanations for the symptom presentation must have been ruled out before the diagnosis is applied.

### Prevalence of anxiety disorders among adults seeking speech therapy for stuttering [^1656d5b7]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

The present study explored the prevalence of anxiety disorders among adults seeking speech therapy for stuttering. Employing a matched case-control design, participants included 92 adults seeking treatment for stuttering, and 920 age- and gender-matched controls from the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Well-being. A conditional logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) anxiety disorders. Compared with matched controls, the stuttering group had six- to seven-fold increased odds of meeting a 12-month diagnosis of any DSM-IV or ICD-10 anxiety disorder. In terms of 12-month prevalence, they also had 16- to 34-fold increased odds of meeting criteria for DSM-IV or ICD-10 social phobia, four-fold increased odds of meeting criteria for DSM-IV generalized anxiety disorder, and six-fold increased odds of meeting criteria for ICD-10 panic disorder. Overall, stuttering appears to be associated with a dramatically heightened risk of a range of anxiety disorders.

### PTSD or not PTSD? Comparing the proposed ICD-11 and the DSM-5 PTSD criteria among young survivors of the 2011 Norway attacks and their parents [^80bf80ad]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Prediction of anxiety and depression, functional impairment and life satisfaction

One of the main aims of this study was to evaluate the predictive validity of the proposed ICD-11 diagnosis and the DSM-5 diagnosis. In accordance with the findings from O'Donnell et al. who studied an Australian adult traumatic injury sample, we found that there were small and inconsistent differences in the predictive validity of the DSM-5 v. the ICD-11 diagnosis. This may indicate that the systems are equally reliable for identifying individuals in need of mental health interventions.

Harmonizing the diagnostic systems may benefit patients across the world, and extensive efforts have been made to reach that goal. Following the recent revisions, a major question is whether the discrepancy between the diagnostic systems has increased or decreased. Studies comparing changes between ICD-10 and the proposed ICD-11 have shown reduced prevalence of PTSD, indicating that the new criteria are either more specific or less sensitive or both. Previous evidence has suggested that the PTSD prevalence estimates of DSM-IV and ICD-10 were quite similar (Morina et al.), and Stein et al. found even greater similarity between the ICD-11 and DSM-5 in the same sample. However, as shown in this study, distinct differences between the systems also seem to result in disturbingly low overlap in the individuals being diagnosed across systems. For individuals suffering from post-traumatic stress, diagnosis may be a gateway to health services, compensation and treatment choices. It is likely that the differences in the DSM and the ICD systems will have practical implications for many individuals in the years to come.

### Alcohol consumption and internalising disorders in young adults of ALSPAC: a population-based study [^800c620e]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2020). Medium credibility.

MEASURES

Internalising disorders

Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD)

GAD was assessed using a self-administered online version of the Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R) based on the extensively used International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) criteria, and created a binary variable indicating presence or absence of GAD over the past 1-week period.

Depression

We assessed depression using the CIS-R and ICD-10 criteria based on the previous 1-month period. For this study, we used a binary variable indicating the presence of depression (merged mild, moderate and severe depression) or not over the past 1-week period.

Fear-Based Anxieties (FBA)

Given that social anxieties associate with harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption, we created a binary FBA variable by grouping three ICD-10 anxiety disorders from CIS-R: agoraphobia, social phobia and panic disorder over the past 1 week due to interrelated and overlapping cluster of phobic symptoms between them.

The use of this standardised version of the CIS-R within a community setting such as ALSPAC has been previously validated and demonstrated that lay assessors such as research nurses were as reliable as psychiatrists and did not exhibit bias in their use of CIS-R. The CIS-R assigns a total weighted score according to the frequency and severity of symptoms during the week immediately preceding the interview.

### Committee opinion no. 705: mental health disorders in adolescents [^c4b6ae74]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Box 1 — Common mental health disorders and defining features in adolescents outlines anxiety disorders, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and mood disorders. Generalized anxiety disorder involves excessive anxiety and worry about multiple events with intensity, duration, or frequency out of proportion and difficulty controlling worry. Social anxiety disorder is a marked and persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations causing extreme distress or avoidance. Panic disorder is recurrent unexpected panic attacks; a panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense fear or discomfort that peaks within minutes and during which time four or more of 13 physical and cognitive symptoms occur. OCD includes symptom dimensions such as cleaning, symmetry, forbidden or taboo thoughts, and harm. PTSD features characteristic symptom clusters after exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence. Mood disorders include adjustment disorder with depressed mood, in which symptoms occur within 3 months of the stressor onset, and major depressive disorder, defined by a period of at least 2 weeks with depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure, with irritability possible in youth.

### Pre-existing and new-onset depression and anxiety among workers with injury or illness work leaves [^e72a5109]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
Flow diagram depicting the generation of the study population.

Depressive and anxiety disorder diagnoses were abstracted from the outpatient and inpatient medical records if the date of diagnosis was in the 12-months before or after the start of the work leave. The 12-month time period before the work leave was used to coincide with metrics from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. The 12-month time period after the work leave was used as most STD claims resolve within 12-months. Work leaves due to a depressive or anxiety disorder were also considered as diagnoses. Depressive disorders included mood disorders with depressive features (F06.31, F06.32, F06.34), major depressive disorder (F32.X excluding F32.8X and F33.X), and dysthymic disorder (F34.1). Anxiety disorders included agoraphobia (F40.0X), social phobias (F40.1X), and other panic disorders (F41.X, generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder).

Pre-existing depression and anxiety were defined as being diagnosed with the disorder(s) in the 12-months prior to a work leave. New-onset depression and anxiety were defined as being diagnosed with the disorder(s) in the 12-months after the beginning of a work leave and not present in the 12-months prior. Identifying depression and other mental illnesses in administrative claims databases has limitations including the variability of recording comorbid depression codes in the medical records that can result in different rates of mental illness across health systems. To protect against false positive diagnoses and increase the probability of selecting a population with clinically recognizable depression or anxiety, individuals were considered to have depression or anxiety if their claims had 1) at least two diagnoses or 2) one diagnosis and at least one prescription for depression or anxiety.

### Anxiety disorders increase risk for incident myocardial infarction in depressed and nondepressed veterans administration patients [^916f748e]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is a risk factor for incident myocardial infarction (MI), but little is known about the independent or additive risk from anxiety disorders.

Methods

In a 7-year retrospective cohort design, we identified a cohort free of cardiovascular disease in fiscal years 1999 and 2000 that contained 96,612 patients between 25 and 80 years of age who had an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code indicating a diagnosis of depression in 2000 (baseline) and 259,387 patients without depression. Cox proportional hazards models stratified by depression were computed to test for a main effect of anxiety disorder unspecified, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on risk of incident MI. The models were adjusted for multiple MI risk factors and sociodemographics.

Results

Depressed as compared to nondepressed Veterans Administration patients were at increased risk for incident MI (HR 1.39; 95% CI 1.34–1.45). In nondepressed patients those with anxiety disorder unspecified (HR 1.34; 95% CI 1.21–1.47), panic disorder (HR 1.43; 95% CI 1.11–1.83), and PTSD (HR 1.25; 95% CI 1.16–1.36) were at increased risk for incident MI. The independent risk associated with anxiety disorders was reduced in patients comorbid for depression.

Conclusions

In Veterans Administration patients free of heart disease in 1999 and 2000, those with depression, anxiety disorder unspecified, panic disorder, and PTSD were at increased risk of incident MI. Anxiety disorders are independent risk factors for MI. Depression partially accounts for the effect of anxiety disorders on risk of MI in patients with both conditions.

### Management of anxiety and depression in adult survivors of cancer: ASCO guideline update [^98151b42]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Generalized anxiety risk factors and severity features in adults with cancer include to "Identify pertinent history/specific risk factors for (generalized) anxiety" such as prior anxiety diagnoses, comorbid psychiatric disorders, substance use/abuse, and other chronic illness(es). For "None/mild symptomatology", descriptors include "None or mild symptoms of anxiety", "No/minimal functional impairment", and "Effective coping skills and access to social support". For "Moderate symptomatology", descriptors include "May present as worries or concerns regarding cancer but also worry, concern about multiple other areas", with "Functional impairment from mild to moderate", and to "Consider possible comorbid anxiety disorders, eg, panic, social phobia" and "Determine presence of comorbid mood disorders (eg, MDD)". For "Moderate to severe/severe symptomatology", guidance notes "Symptoms interfere moderately to markedly with functioning", "Symptoms not responding to pathway 2", "Referral to psychology and/or psychiatry for diagnosis and treatment", and to "Consider possible comorbid anxiety diagnoses such as panic disorder or social phobia". The figure clarifies that "In this algorithm, the use of the word anxiety refers to the GAD-7 scale scores and not to clinical diagnosis of anxiety disorder(s)".

### Incidence of anxiety and depression in children and young people with life-limiting conditions [^d8b9d5ca]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Study population

The cohort used in this study was identified by CPRD (Supplementary Fig. 1). The classification of life-limiting and chronic conditions was conducted using previously developed Read code (CPRD) and ICD-10 code (HES) lists. Children and young people with life-limiting conditions, the index group in the cohort identification process, were included if they were registered at a CPRD practice between 1 April 2007 and 31 December 2017 and were eligible for linkage. These children and young people were subsequently matched on year if birth, sex, and region to one child or young person with a chronic condition, and up to two children with no long-term condition. Children were eligible for the study if they were aged between 5 and 18 years.

The index date for the study was set as the latest of the child or young person's diagnosis of a life-limiting condition/chronic condition and the date at which they turned 5 years old. Participants were followed up until the earliest of the following: occurrence of the outcome (anxiety/depression), date at which they turned 19 years old, date of death, date they transferred out of the practice, last data collection date of the practice and the study end date (31 December 2017). Children and young people with a record of the outcome of interest before the date at which they were diagnosed with a life-limiting/chronic condition were excluded from the analysis for that outcome. In addition, the first month of registration at the practice was excluded from the follow-up time, as codes recorded during this period are often related to prevalent, rather than incident, conditions.

Outcomes

Anxiety and depression were identified using diagnostic and symptom Read codes in CPRD, prescription codes in CPRD, and ICD-10 codes in HES. Lists of diagnostic and symptom Read codes were generated using previously published methods. All ICD-10 codes relating to anxiety or depression, except for one code for specific (isolated) phobias and one code relating to co-morbid anxiety and depression, were included in each respective code list. Lists of suicide-related Read and ICD-10 codes were used to aid in the identification of depression cases. Read codes relating to the use of anxiety/depression screening tools were also included, in addition to generic codes from CPRD or HES data which indicated the offer or receipt of generic psychological support. Previously published methods were also used to generate lists of anxiety/depression prescription codes; namely, prescriptions for antidepressants, anxiolytics, and hypnotics.

### Is disorder X in category or spectrum Y? General considerations and application to the relationship between obsessive-compulsive disorder and anxiety disorders [^426a13b7]. Depression and Anxiety (2008). Low credibility.

Is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) best categorized as an anxiety disorder? This question has been raised previously, but advances in the psychobiology of OCD and the anxiety disorders, and preparations for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V and International Classification of Diseases-11, make reconsideration timely. The debate in turn raises the more general issue of how best to address any question of the form "is disorder x in category or spectrum y?" Such questions are related to a number of key debates in philosophy of science and language and have also increasingly been addressed by the cognitive-affective neuroscience of categorization. Here, we review this background debate and use OCD as a relevant exemplar.

### Efficacy of typical and atypical antipsychotics for primary and comorbid anxiety symptoms or disorders: a review [^e29136b5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The efficacy of antipsychotics in the treatment of primary or comorbid anxiety disorders or anxiety symptoms in major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder was reviewed.

Data Sources

English-language literature cited in MEDLINE from January 1, 1968, to December 31, 2005, was searched with the keywords anxiety disorder, anxiety symptoms, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, social phobia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, antipsychotics, typical antipsychotics, atypical antipsychotics, fluphenazine, haloperidol, perphenazine, pimozide, thiothixene, trifluoperazine, loxapine, molindone, chlorpromazine, mesoridazine, thioridazine, fluspirilene, penfluridol, pipothiazine, flupenthixol, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole, amisulpride, and clinical trial. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and open-label studies with a minimum of 20 subjects with a DSM-III/IV or ICD-10 diagnosis of anxiety disorder and studies without a DSM-III/IV or ICD-10 diagnosis of anxiety disorder but with Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) scores as an outcome were prioritized. Studies on bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder with the analysis of changes in anxiety symptoms were reviewed. Early studies on neurosis/ anxiety or anxious depression without a HAM-A component were also reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Six trials in primary generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), 15 in refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), 8 in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 6 in neurosis with the HAM-A, 1 in social phobia, and 2 in anxiety symptoms in bipolar depression were identified. Low doses of trifluoperazine were superior to placebo in the treatment of GAD. Most of the less well-designed studies showed that other typical antipsychotics might be superior to placebo or as effective as benzodiazepines in the treatment of GAD and other anxiety conditions. In most studies, risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine augmentation to antidepressants was superior to placebo in treating refractory OCD and PTSD. Both olanzapine and quetiapine significantly reduced anxiety compared to placebo in studies of bipolar depression.

Conclusion

Except for trifluoperazine, there is no large, well-designed study of antipsychotics in the treatment of primary or comorbid anxiety symptoms or disorders. The efficacy of these agents in various anxiety conditions needs to be further investigated with large, well-designed comparison studies.

### Screening for anxiety in children and adolescents: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^629fcf18]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF — screening tools, diagnostic follow-up, and intervals state that anxiety screening tools alone are not sufficient to diagnose anxiety and that if a screening test is positive, a confirmatory diagnostic assessment and follow-up is required. Currently, only 2 screening instruments are widely used in clinical practice for detecting anxiety: Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) and Social Phobia Inventory, and the USPSTF found no evidence on appropriate or recommended screening intervals, with the optimal interval unknown.

### Co-morbidity between mood and anxiety disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4c81b7d5]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

3.9 BIPOLAR and anxiety disorder: Period prevalence comorbidity

We identified 14 studies (eReference 10) for period prevalence comorbidity between BIPOLAR and different anxiety disorders (Table 5). The crude OR (95% CI) ranged between 4.9 (for BIPOLAR and both ANX (2.0, 12.2) and also specific phobia (4.1, 5.8) based on three studies), and 11.6 (8.9, 15.0) for BIPOLAR and panic disorder based on three studies. The aOR (95% CI) ranged between 3.7 (2.1, 6.5) for BIPOLAR and social phobia based on four studies, and 7.4 (1.6, 34.0) for BIPOLAR and GAD based on three studies.

3.10 Temporally ordered associations between mood‐ and anxiety‐related disorders

Although the majority of these estimates could not be pooled because of low number of studies, there was an elevated risk of comorbidity between different MOOD (as a prior disorder) and different anxiety disorders (as a later disorder), and vice‐versa (etables 2 and 3). For example, those with DEP had 2‐3 times elevated risk of later ANX (aOR = 2.1: 95% CI 1.5, 2.8), those with ANX as a prior disorder had similar risk of developing DEP (aOR = 2.1: 95% CI 1.8, 2.5) (etable 3). The highest risk was observed between DEP as a prior disorder and social phobia as a later disorder (OR = 7.3: 95% CI 6.2, 8.7), while the corresponding risk was about one‐third for those with social phobia as a prior disorder and DEP as a later disorder (OR = 2.5: 95% CI 2.1, 3.1).

### A comparison of the capacity of DSM-IV and DSM-5 acute stress disorder definitions to predict posttraumatic stress disorder and related disorders [^01a8a0a7]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

This study addresses the extent to which DSM-IV and DSM-5 definitions of acute stress disorder (ASD) predict subsequent posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related psychiatric disorders following trauma.

Method

Patients with randomized admissions to 5 hospitals across Australia (N = 596) were assessed in hospital and reassessed for PTSD at 3 (n = 508), 12 (n = 426), 24 (n = 439), and 72 (n = 314) months using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale; DSM-IV definition of PTSD was used at each assessment, and DSM-5 definition was used at 72 months. The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used at each assessment to assess anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders.

Results

Forty-five patients (8%) met DSM-IV criteria, and 80 patients (14%) met DSM-5 criteria for ASD. PTSD was diagnosed in 93 patients (9%) at 3, 82 patients (10%) at 12, 100 patients (12%) at 24, and 26 patients (8%) at 72 months; 19 patients (6%) met DSM-5 criteria for PTSD at 72 months. Comparable proportions of those diagnosed with ASD developed PTSD using DSM-IV (3 months = 46%, 12 months = 39%, 24 months = 32%, and 72 months = 25%) and DSM-5 (43%, 42%, 33%, and 24%) ASD definitions. Sensitivity was improved for DSM-5 relative to DSM-IV for depression (0.18 vs 0.30), panic disorder (0.19 vs 0.41), agoraphobia (0.14 vs 0.40), social phobia (0.12 vs 0.44), specific phobia (0.24 vs 0.58), obsessive-compulsive disorder (0.17 vs 0.47), and generalized anxiety disorder (0.20 vs 0.47). More than half of participants with DSM-5-defined ASD had a subsequent disorder.

Conclusions

The DSM-5 criteria for ASD results in better identification of people who will subsequently develop PTSD or another psychiatric disorder relative to the DSM-IV criteria. Although prediction is modest, it suggests that the new ASD diagnosis can serve a useful function in acute trauma settings for triaging those who can benefit from either early intervention or subsequent monitoring.

### The specific and combined role of domestic violence and mental health disorders during pregnancy on new-born health [^05de9432]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Trained psychologists began data collection in the beginning of the third trimester – around the 28th week – during routine pre-natal care visits. Domestic violence against women was measured according to the WHO Domestic Violence Questionnaire. Questions 704 to 706 in the Questionnaire assess for 7 types of physical abuse, 4 types of psychological abuse, and 3 types of sexual abuse perpetrated by the husband/partner in the last 12 months. Given that the mothers were in their 6th month of gestation when assessed, violence may have occurred immediately before or during gestation (or, in some cases, during both these periods). Mental health disorders were measured according to the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) – a short and structured diagnostic interview used to reveal current disorders. Both instruments had been previously adapted to the Brazilian population before being used in this study. Physical, psychological, and sexual violence were analyzed separately and then pooled in one variable named "violence". Recurrent episodes of domestic violence reported within the last 12 months were considered positive. Mental disorders were pooled in the following groups: " mood disorder " – current hypomanic episode (ICD-10 F31.8), current manic episode (ICD-10 F30.x), current dysthymic disorder (ICD-10 F34.1), current major depression (ICD-10 F32.x); " anxiety " – current panic disorder without agoraphobia (ICD-10 F40.01), current panic disorder with agoraphobia (ICD-10 F40.0), social phobia (ICD-10 F40.1), post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD-10 F43.1), general anxiety disorder (ICD-10 F41.1); " OCD-obsessive compulsive disorder " – (ICD-10 F42.8); " substance dependence " – alcohol and illicit drugs dependence (ICD-10 F10.2× and F11.0 - F19.1), " anti social personality disorder " – (ICD-10 F60.2), and " psychotic disorder " – (ICD-10 F32.3 and F33.3).

### Social fear and social phobia types among community youth: differential clinical features and vulnerability factors [^b8303134]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare different social fears and social phobia subtypes with regard to clinical (age of onset, avoidance, impairment, comorbidities) and vulnerability factors (behavioural inhibition (BI), parental psychopathology and parental rearing) among community youth.

Methods

Fears of 6 social situations and Social Phobia (SP), along with their clinical features, were assessed using the Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview (DIA-X/M-CIDI) in a population-based sample of N = 3021 14–24 year olds that were followed up for 10 years. BI and parental rearing were assessed using self-report questionnaires. Parental psychopathology was assessed directly in parents via DIA-X/M-CIDI, supplemented by offsprings' family history reports.

Results

In the total sample, 20.0%, 11.6%, 11.7% reported fear of 1, 2, 3 or more social situations, respectively; rates were 24.2%, 18.7%, and 57.1% in SP-cases (6.6% of the total sample). Exploring the factorial structure indicated rather unidimensionality of social fears than mutual distinction of social fears by interaction vs. performance situations. Except for fear of taking tests and public speaking, social fears rarely occurred in isolation. Social fears of both interaction and performance situations were associated with severe avoidance (vs. fear of either situation; Odds Ratios, OR = 1.5, 95%CI: 1.1–1.9) and impairment (OR = 3.6, 95%CI: 2.6–4.9), and more comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders (OR range 3.2–5.8, p > .001). Fear of interaction situations was associated with higher BI (vs. performance-related fears, OR range 1.2–2.1, p < .05). Associations with parental psychopathology and unfavourable parental rearing were less consistent, albeit stronger for fear of interaction situations (vs. performance-related fears). Interactions with time indicated an earlier onset of SP for higher BI, but not for parental psychopathology or unfavourable parental rearing.

Conclusions

Interaction-related social fears differ in their clinical and vulnerability factors from performance-related social fears. The current DSM-IV specifier of "generalized" SP may fall short of adequately denoting these differences. Fear of taking tests appears to be conceptually and, possibly, etiologically distinct from other social fears, and may be better placed in another category (e.g., as a type of specific phobia).

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^b8b4d0b8]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Applicability of AHRQ/Mayo anxiety treatment findings — population, disorders, and age scope: The treatment findings were stated to be likely widely applicable to children and adolescents with separation anxiety, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, panic, and specific phobia disorders, with minimal psychiatric comorbidities, who are on average 8 to 18 years old and have access to CBT or prescribers of SSRIs or SNRIs. Because specific phobia was not represented as the primary disorder in medication studies, this disorder was not included in the AACAP medication treatment statements. Although the findings were said to apply to those "on average" 8 to 18 years old, both medication and therapy studies included children as young as 6 years old, and the treatment statements extend downward to age 6. Although most studies involved predominantly White populations, there is no compelling rational for rendering the treatment statements inapplicable to minority populations.

### Work incapacity and psychiatric patient care following attempted suicide-a cohort study of 65 097 Swedish twins [^7caaeac4]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Social insurance in Sweden

Sickness absence benefits are available to everyone in Sweden older than 16 with a minimum qualifying annual income, unemployment benefits, or parental benefits. Usually, the first day of sickness absence is considered a qualifying day where no benefits are paid, though self-employed may have more qualifying days depending on their insurance. For employed individuals, benefits are paid by the employer between days 2 and 14, and from day 15 they are paid by the Social Insurance Agency. Disability pension is a form of compensation for longer-lasting or permanent work incapacity due to an injury or disease. It is available to everyone between 19 and 64 years old, though those aged 19–29 can only get temporary disability pension (SIA).

Outcomes

The follow-up period was from 2007–2013, with the measured outcomes being:
Short-term work incapacity, defined as receiving sickness absence benefits.
Long-term work incapacity, defined as receiving disability pension benefits.
Psychiatric patient care, defined as receiving inpatient care or specialized outpatient psychiatric care for a mental disorder (diagnostic codes F00–F99 in ICD-10).

Covariates

Covariates controlled for in the study were sex, age, level of education, area of residence, and family situation in 2006, as well as sickness absence, unemployment, and inpatient care or specialized outpatient care for a common mental disorder or musculoskeletal disorder between 2004 and 2006 and psychiatric medication between 2005 and 2006 (Table 1). Common mental disorders included ICD-10 diagnostic codes F32 (depressive episode), F33 (recurrent depressive disorder), F40 (phobic anxiety disorders), F41 (other anxiety disorders), F42 (obsessive-compulsive disorder), and F43 (reaction to severe stress, and adjustment disorders). Musculoskeletal disorders corresponded to the ICD-10 diagnostic codes M00–99. Psychiatric medication prescribed between the years 2005 and 2006 was also controlled for, namely antidepressants (N06A), anxiolytics (N05B), and hypnotics and sedatives (N05C) according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System. All the covariates were assumed as important factors associated both with exposure and outcomes and they were also used as covariates in other similar studies (Niederkrotenthaler et al.).

### Maternal perinatal cannabis use disorder and the risk of anxiety disorders in offspring: insights from a longitudinal data-linkage cohort study [^e951e22b]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cannabis use is increasing among women of reproductive age, but its impact on childhood anxiety disorders remains understudied. This study investigates whether maternal cannabis use disorder (CUD) during pregnancy and the postnatal period is associated with a higher risk of anxiety disorders in offspring.

Methods

We used linked administrative health data from New South Wales, Australia, covering live births from 2003 to 2005. Maternal CUD and child anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), phobic anxiety disorder (PAD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), separation and social anxiety disorders, were identified using ICD-10 codes. Generalized linear models (GLMs) with log-binomial regression estimated adjusted risk ratios (aRRs). Mediation and propensity score matching (PSM) analyses were also conducted to test the robustness of findings.

Results

After adjusting for covariates, offspring prenatally exposed to maternal CUD had an increased risk of any anxiety disorder [adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 1.79 (95% CI 1.40, 2.26)]; specifically PTSD [aRR = 2.46 (95% CI 1.78, 3.33)], GAD [aRR = 2.18 (95% CI 1.03, 4.60)], and CADs [aRR = 1.91 (95% CI 1.05, 4.60)], compared to non-exposed offspring. Postnatal CUD exposure was also associated with an increased risk of any anxiety disorder [aRR = 2.02 (95% CI 1.22, 3.14)] and PTSD [aRR = 2.97 (95% CI 1.56, 5.17)]. These associations remained significant in mediation and PSM analyses.

Conclusion

Maternal CUD during pregnancy and the postnatal period is associated with elevated risks of anxiety disorders in offspring. These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions, including perinatal counselling, to reduce anxiety risks in offspring.

### Effects of sex and gender on the etiologies and presentation of select internalizing psychopathologies [^c2a37ef9]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Generalized anxiety disorder

The American Psychiatric Association defines anxiety as a normal response to stress which can even be beneficial in some situations, such as increasing attention and focus on a test or work task. However, anxiety disorders differ from temporary feelings of anxiousness or nervousness with more intense feelings of fear or anxiety. The DSM-5 specifically describes anxiety disorders as excessive worry and apprehensive expectations, occurring more days than not for at least 6 months. Anxiety and worry are associated with three or more of the following six symptoms with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months: (a) restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge; (b) easily fatigued; (c) difficulty concentrating or mind going blank; (d) irritability; (e) muscle tension; (f) sleep disturbance such as difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless and unsatisfying sleep. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health concern globally, and it's estimated that 19.1% of US adults have an anxiety disorder. This estimate approached 40% of the adult population at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Between 5–12% of children under 18 experience anxiety issues each year, and most people develop symptoms before age 21. Women are more likely than men to have anxiety disorders. By age 6, girls were already twice as likely as boys to have experienced an anxiety disorder. There are six different types of anxiety disorders - generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, phobias, separation anxiety disorder and substance or medication-induced anxiety disorder. Women self-rate their anxiety symptoms worse than men and diagnostic instruments support these reports, with women scoring 12.3% higher than men for somatization, interpersonal sensitivity and panic. Women were more likely to suffer from comorbid depression and bulimia nervosa, and less likely to have a comorbid SUD. Most large studies focus on GAD which has an age of onset in early adulthood with symptoms persisting into later life. Men with GAD had higher rates of comorbid SUDs, nicotine dependence, and antisocial personality disorder. Women with GAD had higher rates of comorbid mood disorders (except bipolar disorder) and other anxiety disorders (except social anxiety disorder). Despite women having greater odds of an anxiety disorder diagnosis, there has been no reported difference in social anxiety disorder. The lifetime and 12-month man:woman prevalence of any anxiety disorder were 1:1.7 and 1:1.79, respectively. Although there were no significant differences between men and women in age of onset within various racial categories, there was a significant interaction between gender and race such that the age of onset for social anxiety disorder was lower (mean age = 11.4 years) among European American men than among African American women (mean age = 13.8 years).

### Innovations and changes in the ICD-11 classification of mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders [^3ab4a856]. World Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Following approval of the ICD-11 by the World Health Assembly in May 2019, World Health Organization (WHO) member states will transition from the ICD-10 to the ICD-11, with reporting of health statistics based on the new system to begin on January 1, 2022. The WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse will publish Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines (CDDG) for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural and Neurodevelopmental Disorders following ICD-11's approval. The development of the ICD-11 CDDG over the past decade, based on the principles of clinical utility and global applicability, has been the most broadly international, multilingual, multidisciplinary and participative revision process ever implemented for a classification of mental disorders. Innovations in the ICD-11 include the provision of consistent and systematically characterized information, the adoption of a lifespan approach, and culture-related guidance for each disorder. Dimensional approaches have been incorporated into the classification, particularly for personality disorders and primary psychotic disorders, in ways that are consistent with current evidence, are more compatible with recovery-based approaches, eliminate artificial comorbidity, and more effectively capture changes over time. Here we describe major changes to the structure of the ICD-11 classification of mental disorders as compared to the ICD-10, and the development of two new ICD-11 chapters relevant to mental health practice. We illustrate a set of new categories that have been added to the ICD-11 and present the rationale for their inclusion. Finally, we provide a description of the important changes that have been made in each ICD-11 disorder grouping. This information is intended to be useful for both clinicians and researchers in orienting themselves to the ICD-11 and in preparing for implementation in their own professional contexts.

### DSM-5 and ICD-11 definitions of posttraumatic stress disorder: investigating "narrow" and "broad" approaches [^c39603f8]. Depression and Anxiety (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The development of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition (DSM-5) and ICD-11 has led to reconsideration of diagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys allow investigation of the implications of the changing criteria compared to DSM-IV and ICD-10.

Methods

WMH Surveys in 13 countries asked respondents to enumerate all their lifetime traumatic events (TEs) and randomly selected one TE per respondent for PTSD assessment. DSM-IV and ICD-10 PTSD were assessed for the 23,936 respondents who reported lifetime TEs in these surveys with the fully structured Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). DSM-5 and proposed ICD-11 criteria were approximated. Associations of the different criteria sets with indicators of clinical severity (distress-impairment, suicidality, comorbid fear-distress disorders, PTSD symptom duration) were examined to investigate the implications of using the different systems.

Results

A total of 5.6% of respondents met criteria for "broadly defined" PTSD (i.e., full criteria in at least one diagnostic system), with prevalence ranging from 3.0% with DSM-5 to 4.4% with ICD-10. Only one-third of broadly defined cases met criteria in all four systems and another one third in only one system (narrowly defined cases). Between-system differences in indicators of clinical severity suggest that ICD-10 criteria are least strict and DSM-IV criteria most strict. The more striking result, though, is that significantly elevated indicators of clinical significance were found even for narrowly defined cases for each of the four diagnostic systems.

Conclusions

These results argue for a broad definition of PTSD defined by any one of the different systems to capture all clinically significant cases of PTSD in future studies.

### Assessing the validity of social anxiety disorder subtypes using a nationally representative sample [^0edf4b68]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to examine and validate social anxiety disorder subtypes using the nationally representative National Comorbidity Survey Replication (N = 9282). Generalized and non-generalized subtypes were defined as fearing at least 8 (i.e., most) and fewer than 7 of 14 possible social situations, respectively, following the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR). Results indicated that in those with social anxiety disorder, the odds of having comorbid major depression, a comorbid anxiety disorder, and suicidal ideation were significantly greater in the generalized subtype. However, differences were no longer significant when adjusting for the number of feared social situations. Results further indicated that the number of feared social situations was significantly associated with comorbid major depression, a comorbid anxiety disorder, and suicidal ideation. These findings call into question the validity of DSM-IV-defined subtypes and provide additional support for the notion that clinicians and researchers should consider viewing this disorder on a single continuum with greater number of feared situations associated with greater clinical severity.

### Mental, behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders in the ICD-11: an international perspective on key changes and controversies [^e129394b]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Dan J. Stein and Geoffrey M. Reed

Overall, our view is that the various changes made in the Mental, Behavioral or Neurodevelopmental Disorders chapter of the ICD-11 contribute to a significant advancement in diagnostic classification as well as in mental health practice and research. However, the ways in which the ICD-11 as well as other important frameworks, including the DSM-5 and the Research Domain Criteria, have and have not advanced the field need to be further understood. In order to do so, two key issues, namely causality and thresholding, should be addressed.

Medical classifications that are based on etiology have important advantages; such a classification system itself provides clear targets for intervention. In the case of mental disorders, this is not possible because the etiology of mental disorders is not only multicausal but also incompletely understood. Importantly, the ICD-11 chapter on Mental, Behavioral or Neurodevelopmental Disorders incorporates the issues of etiology in a number of ways — certain groupings of disorders reflect common underlying mechanisms (e.g. disorders of addictive behaviour), certain diagnoses are based on specified causes (e.g. anxiety due to substance use or to a medical disorder), and certain causal factors can be classified (e.g. in the chapter on Factors Influencing Health Status and Contact with Health Services) but are not considered to be disorders. Continuous revisions of the nosology are important in ensuring that etiology is included to the maximal extent possible, and the ICD-11 chapter on Mental, Behavioral or Neurodevelopmental Disorders therefore represents a useful update.

However, the fact that the ICD-11 classification of mental disorders is not entirely based on causality raises some important considerations. First, there is not necessarily a close relationship between diagnosis, underlying neurobiological vulnerabilities, social determinants, and appropriate intervention. Second, there is likely to be some artefactual increase in comorbidity — multiple diagnoses of mental disorders in a particular individual may not indicate that a range of truly separate sets of underlying psychobiological processes are involved but rather may simply point to greater underlying dysfunction. Third, there is a temptation to reify psychiatric constructs, inappropriately regarding them as natural kinds. All of these considerations point to the importance of regarding mental disorder classification systems as tentative, of emphasizing the need for careful individualized assessment, and of recognizing the need for a range of interventions to address the multiple causal factors at play in mental illness.

### Comorbidity of substance misuse with anxiety-related and depressive disorders: a genetically informative population study of 3 million individuals in Sweden [^c2660a69]. Psychological Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Causes of the comorbidity of substance misuse with anxiety-related and depressive disorders (anxiety/depression) remain poorly known. We estimated associations of substance misuse and anxiety/depression in the general population and tested them while accounting for genetic and shared environmental factors.

Methods

We studied individuals born in Sweden 1968–1997 (n = 2 996 398) with follow-up in nationwide register data for 1997–2013. To account for familial effects, stratified analyses were conducted within siblings and twin pairs. Substance misuse was defined as ICD-10 alcohol or drug use disorder or an alcohol/drug-related criminal conviction. Three dimensions of ICD-10 anxiety and depressive disorders and a substance misuse dimension were identified through exploratory factor analysis.

Results

Substance misuse was associated with a 4.5-fold (95% CI 4.50–4.58) elevated risk of lifetime generalized anxiety/depression, 4.7-fold (95% CI 4.63–4.82) elevated risk of panic disorder and agora/social phobia, and 2.9-fold elevated risk of phobias/OCD (95% CI 2.82–3.02) as compared to those without substance misuse. The associations were attenuated in within-family analyses but we found elevated risks in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for substance misuse as well as significant non-shared environmental correlations. The association between anxiety/depression and substance misuse was mainly driven by generalized anxiety/depression, whereas other anxiety/depression dimensions had minor or no independent associations with substance misuse.

Conclusions

Substance misuse and anxiety/depression are associated at the population level, and these associations are partially explained by familial liabilities. Our findings indicate a common genetic etiology but are also compatible with a potential partially causal relationship between substance misuse and anxiety/depression.

### Psychological and demographic characteristics of 368 patients with dissociative seizures: data from the CODES cohort [^069de5bd]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The majority (241; 65%) indicated they had previously sought help for a mental health problem and, of the 365 responding, 261 (72%) reported currently suffering from another medical problem.

Psychiatric comorbidities

Data on M. I.N. I. diagnoses is shown in Table 4. In total, 255 participants (69%) had at least one current M. I.N. I. diagnosis, and 247 (67%) at least one previous M. I.N. I. diagnosis. The median number of current M. I.N. I. diagnoses was 2 (range 0–8) (see Supplementary Table 1 for more detail). The five most common current diagnoses (present in > 20% of the sample; Table 3) were Agoraphobia (44.8%), Major Depressive Disorder (31%), Generalised Anxiety Disorder (29.3%), Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (23.4%), and Social Phobia (Social Anxiety Disorder) (20.4%). The most common past diagnosis was Major Depressive Disorder (52.4%). Of the total, 63% met criteria for suicidality and of these, 22.4% were judged high risk, although none were felt to be at imminent risk of self-harm by their study psychiatrist. A very small number were found to show substance dependence, not detected during the earlier assessment, on the M. I.N. I.

Table 4.
Numbers and percentages of sample attaining diagnoses on the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview

On the SAPAS-SR (completed by n = 363) the mean score was 3.9 (2.0; range 0–8) and 211 (58%) of the cohort had scores suggesting maladaptive personality traits. Online Supplementary Figure 1 shows the frequency of responses arranged in the three clusters identified by Germans et al. as broadly corresponding to Personality Clusters A, B, and C. Items most frequently endorsed were: being a worrier, dependence on others, and being a perfectionist ('Cluster C' items), whilst the least frequently endorsed were 'Cluster A' items (not trusting others, difficulty making and keeping friends, and being a loner).

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^e76feed8]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

AHRQ/Mayo review — scope and methods for treatments of child and adolescent anxiety disorders — The objective of the AHRQ/Mayo review was to evaluate the effectiveness of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for the treatment of specific child and adolescent anxiety disorders and to evaluate safety concerns, and it was made available in August 2017 with errata published in July 2018. To be eligible, studies included children and adolescents between 3 and 18 years old with confirmed diagnoses of panic, social anxiety, specific phobia (including school phobia), generalized anxiety, or separation anxiety disorder, who received any psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy (alone or combined), and reported specified outcomes. Specified outcomes included primary anxiety symptoms from patient, parent, or clinician measures; secondary anxiety outcomes such as coping, avoidance, or anxious thoughts; global function; social function; satisfaction with treatment; response to treatment; and remission of the disorder. Both randomized controlled trials and comparative observational studies were included for effectiveness outcomes, and case reports or case series were used to identify adverse events. The key questions were twofold, addressing the comparative effectiveness of treatments for these disorders and the general and potential harms of available treatments. The strength of evidence for each outcome and comparison (e.g., fluoxetine vs. CBT) was rated via a consensus process, with randomized controlled trials starting with high strength of evidence and observational studies starting with low strength, and initial ratings were then raised or lowered based on five additional domains: risk of bias, precision, directness, consistency, and publication bias.

Apathy

Apathy is defined as a lack of motivation characterized by reduced goal-oriented thinking and action, as well as reduced emotional expression. It is, therefore, a drive disorder that can have a negative impact on the motivation for self-care and is often a major burden for relatives. Meta-analytic data have indicated a prevalence of 40% for apathetic symptoms in PwPD, with the occurrence of apathy being associated with older age, cognitive impairment, the presence of depressive disorders, and more advanced PD symptoms.

Anxiety disorders and fear of progression

According to the ICD-11, anxiety disorders are defined as mental disorders characterized by excessive fear and anxiety and associated behavioral disturbances, with symptoms severe enough to cause significant distress or impairment in personal, familial, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Various diagnoses can be considered anxiety disorder diagnoses, including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific phobias, or social anxiety disorder. In a systematic review with a meta-analysis based on 45 studies with N = 2399 PwPD, a prevalence of 31% for anxiety disorders in general was identified, with generalized anxiety disorder being the most common type of anxiety disorder at 14%. Furthermore, the point prevalence for social anxiety disorder was 14%, 13% for unspecified anxiety, 13% for specific phobias, and 7% for panic disorder. During the course of chronic diseases, fear of progression has also been described. Fear of progression is a real fear that arises from the experience of a serious, potentially life-threatening, or disabling disease and its diagnosis and treatment. In terms of differential diagnoses, fear of progression must be clearly distinguished from anxiety disorders. In a study that compared chronic diseases in terms of the extent of their associated fear of progression, PD showed the second-highest values. In a cross-sectional study that Folkerts et al. conducted with N = 120 PwPD, moderate levels of fear of progression were found in 63% of respondents, while 18% showed dysfunctional levels of fear of progression.
