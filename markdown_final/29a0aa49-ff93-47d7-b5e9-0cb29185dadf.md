## Question

lantus to basaglar conversin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about converting from Lantus (insulin glargine 100 units/mL) to Basaglar (insulin glargine 100 units/mL), including dose conversion, timing, monitoring, special populations, and a practical checklist for implementation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and pharmacologic comparability of Basaglar to Lantus. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled switching guidance for same-concentration insulin glargine products. Next, I will review clinical trial and real-world evidence supporting a 1:1 conversion. After that, I need to consider exceptions such as switching from higher-concentration glargine or NPH, and how to handle those. Finally, I should outline monitoring, titration, special populations, and a concise implementation checklist, making sure I double-check each claim against the label and key studies as I go.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory and pharmacologic context. Basaglar is a follow-on insulin glargine product with the same amino acid sequence, pharmaceutical form, and strength (U-100) as Lantus, and it was developed to be highly similar in structure and function; regulatory reviews and clinical programs support comparable PK/PD, efficacy, and safety to the reference Lantus, which underpins unit-for-unit switching in routine care [^1158wpPg] [^115Xt8ro] [^115ubif4] [^111u99aA].

> Now, I should verify the FDA-labeled switching guidance. The Basaglar prescribing information states that when changing patients from another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, to Basaglar, the dose should be the same as the other insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL; this is a direct 1:1 unit conversion for same-concentration glargine products, which applies to switching from Lantus U-100 to Basaglar U-100 [^113VcYZA].

> Wait, let me verify that this aligns with clinical evidence. In randomized trials and real-world cohorts, switching from Lantus to Basaglar maintained similar glycemic control with similar dosing and safety profiles; for example, the ELEMENT-5 program showed noninferior A1c reductions and similar insulin doses, and a retrospective cohort of 225 patients converted from Lantus to Basaglar found no significant difference in mean basal dose at 6 months, supporting a 1:1 conversion in practice [^114cPiQD] [^116WHf87].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — there are important exceptions. If the patient is on insulin glargine 300 units/mL (Toujeo), the Basaglar label recommends starting Basaglar at 80% of the Toujeo dose because of the higher concentration and longer duration of U-300; similarly, when switching from twice-daily NPH to once-daily Basaglar, an 80% total daily NPH dose is advised to mitigate hypoglycemia risk, so I need to ensure I ask about the exact basal product and regimen before converting [^113VcYZA].

> I should confirm timing and administration details. Basaglar, like Lantus, is a once-daily basal insulin with a relatively flat PK/PD profile over 24 hours; it can be administered at the same time of day the patient was using Lantus, and consistent timing supports stable basal coverage, though minor timing adjustments can be made if needed while monitoring glucose closely during the transition [^1127BWU4] [^112oxzu2].

> Next, I should review monitoring and titration. I need to ensure close follow-up during the first 1–2 weeks after switching, with frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose and consideration of continuous glucose monitoring where available; dose titration should be individualized to fasting plasma glucose targets, commonly ≤ 100–110 mg/dL, using simple treat-to-target algorithms adjusting by about 2–4 units every few days based on fasting values, while watching for hypoglycemia and adjusting other diabetes medications as needed [^113zdnhp] [^116sCzgs].

> Let me consider special populations and cautions. In older adults, I should titrate conservatively given blunted hypoglycemia awareness; in renal or hepatic impairment, more frequent glucose monitoring is warranted and dose reductions may be needed because insulin clearance is altered; in hospitalized patients switching from longer-acting basal analogs, temporary dose reductions may be prudent to avoid overlapping effects, with careful inpatient glucose surveillance and subsequent outpatient retitration [^1146K4bo] [^114uxJ1M].

> I should double-check immunogenicity and device considerations. Anti-insulin antibody development has been observed with Basaglar but has not been associated with clinically meaningful differences in efficacy or safety; nonetheless, I need to ensure patients use the correct pen, never share devices, and verify the product label at each injection to prevent mix-ups, especially during transitions [^113Uy2DL] [^116EMZH8].

> But wait, what about cost and access implications of switching? Real-world and claims analyses suggest Basaglar can reduce drug acquisition costs compared with Lantus while maintaining similar glycemic outcomes and adherence, which may support switching when clinically appropriate; however, payer formularies and substitution laws vary, so I should coordinate with pharmacy and insurance to avoid unintended coverage issues during the switch [^116WHf87] [^111zfYxz] [^116wZfe5].

> Let me synthesize a practical implementation checklist. First, confirm the current basal product and concentration; if Lantus U-100, convert unit-for-unit to Basaglar U-100 and maintain the same daily schedule; if Toujeo U-300 or twice-daily NPH, reduce to 80% of the total daily dose when switching to Basaglar; educate the patient on the new pen and label verification; arrange frequent glucose checks for 1–2 weeks; titrate to fasting targets; review concomitant medications that affect glucose or mask hypoglycemia; and schedule follow-up within 2–4 weeks to reassess control and adherence [^113VcYZA] [^116EMZH8] [^113zdnhp].

> In summary, I need to ensure the core message is clear and evidence-based: for patients switching from Lantus U-100 to Basaglar U-100, use a 1:1 unit conversion, keep the same timing, monitor closely, and titrate to fasting glucose targets; apply the 80% rule only when switching from U-300 glargine or from twice-daily NPH, and individualize for special populations and drug interactions to maintain safety and efficacy during the transition [^113VcYZA] [^112oxzu2] [^116WHf87].

Switching from Lantus to Basaglar is a **unit-for-unit conversion** [^113VcYZA] because both are insulin glargine 100 units/mL with similar pharmacokinetics and clinical effects [^115ubif4] [^111u99aA]. No dose adjustment is needed when switching from Lantus to Basaglar, but **monitor glucose closely** during the transition to detect any variability in response [^116EMZH8]. Basaglar offers comparable glycemic control and safety to Lantus [^114cPiQD] [^116WHf87], with potential cost savings [^111zfYxz] [^116vFZDA].

---

## Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic similarity

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Basaglar and Lantus have similar absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination profiles, with prolonged, peakless basal insulin action [^117Q99R6] [^112DJbMK].

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Both provide stable, sustained glucose-lowering over 24 hours, supporting once-daily dosing [^1127BWU4] [^112DJbMK].

- **Clinical studies**: Clamp and clinical trials show comparable PK/PD and clinical effects between Basaglar and Lantus [^115ubif4] [^114cPiQD].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting unit-for-unit conversion

- **ELEMENT studies**: Basaglar was noninferior to Lantus for A1c reduction, fasting glucose, and hypoglycemia, supporting unit-for-unit switching [^114cPiQD] [^111u99aA].

- **Real-world data**: Retrospective studies show no significant dose change or A1c difference after switching from Lantus to Basaglar [^116WHf87].

- **Regulatory guidance**: FDA labeling states Basaglar dose should be the same as other insulin glargine 100 units/mL products [^113VcYZA].

---

## Recommended conversion protocol

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm current Lantus dose and regimen |
| 2 | Initiate Basaglar at the same unit dose and schedule as Lantus |
| 3 | Monitor glucose closely during the first week after switching |
| 4 | Adjust dose based on fasting glucose and clinical response |

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

- **Hypoglycemia**: Monitor for hypoglycemia, especially with changes in insulin or other glucose-lowering drugs [^116LqqBa].

- **Injection technique**: Rotate sites to reduce lipodystrophy and ensure consistent absorption [^113VxFRc].

- **Patient education**: Teach recognition and management of hypo- and hyperglycemia [^116EMZH8].

- **Drug interactions**: Review medications that may alter insulin needs (e.g. beta-blockers, thiazolidinediones) [^1142TVgH].

---

## Potential benefits of switching to Basaglar

Potential benefits include **cost savings**, as Basaglar is typically priced lower than Lantus, offering economic advantages for patients and payers [^111zfYxz] [^116oPYhq]. Real-world data show similar or improved adherence with Basaglar compared with Lantus, likely reflecting cost and access benefits [^117YAMpn]. Basaglar is widely available and included on many formularies, facilitating access [^notfound].

---

## Patient populations requiring caution

- **Renal or hepatic impairment**: Use caution and monitor glucose more frequently due to altered insulin clearance [^1146K4bo].

- **Elderly patients**: Greater hypoglycemia risk; start conservatively and titrate slowly [^1129fave].

- **Pregnancy**: Limited data; use caution and monitor closely.

---

## Summary of key points

- **Unit-for-unit**: Convert Lantus to Basaglar 1:1 without dose change [^113VcYZA].

- **Monitoring**: Close glucose monitoring is essential during the switch [^116EMZH8] [^116LqqBa].

- **Comparable**: Basaglar provides similar efficacy and safety to Lantus [^114cPiQD].

- **Cost**: Potential cost savings with Basaglar [^111zfYxz].

- **Caution**: Use caution in renal/hepatic impairment and elderly patients [^1146K4bo] [^1129fave].

Switching from Lantus to Basaglar is a straightforward, **unit-for-unit conversion** with comparable efficacy and safety; monitor glucose closely and adjust as needed [^111u99aA].

2.4 Changing to BASAGLAR from Other Insulin Therapies

If changing patients from another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, to BASAGLAR, the dose of BASAGLAR should be the same as the other insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL.
If changing patients from a once-daily insulin glargine product, 300 units/mL, to once-daily BASAGLAR, the recommended initial BASAGLAR dosage is 80% of the insulin glargine product, 300 units/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
If changing from a treatment regimen with an intermediate- or long-acting insulin to a regimen with BASAGLAR, a change in the dose of the basal insulin may be required.
If changing patients from twice-daily NPH insulin to once-daily BASAGLAR, the recommended initial BASAGLAR dosage is 80% of the total daily NPH dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Formulary considerations for insulins approved through the 505 (b) (2) "Follow-on" pathway [^1158wpPg]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To summarize formulary-relevant issues for follow-on insulins approved through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 505(b)(2) approval pathway (Basaglar and Admelog).

Data Sources

A search of the MEDLINE database was performed for articles pertaining to clinical and formulary considerations for follow-on insulin products through July 2018.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All clinical trials used in the 505(b)(2) approval process for follow-on insulin glargine and insulin lispro products were included and summarized.

Data Synthesis

Follow-on insulin glargine and insulin lispro products have been recently approved as the first lower-cost alternatives to innovator insulin products. The follow-on insulins were approved via the 505(b)(2) pathway, making them neither generics nor biosimilars. Current data do not suggest any clinically relevant differences between the follow-on insulins and their respective innovator products. Clinicians should be aware that follow-on insulins will be reclassified as biologic products in the year 2020. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This article provides information about currently available follow-on insulin products that were approved through the 505(b)(2) pathway, including product characteristics and efficacy and safety data. These products will likely be considered for both clinical use and formulary placement because of their potentially lower cost compared with innovator products.

Conclusions

Follow-on insulin products approved through the 505(b)(2) pathway are supported by robust efficacy and safety data. As new follow-on insulins are approved and the regulatory change that will occur with these products in 2020 approaches, formulary decisions and clinical policies (eg, substitution) will continue to be revisited.

### Lilly insulin glargine versus lantusin insulin-Naïve and insulin-treated adults with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, controlled trial (ELEMENT 5) [^116cQ5mY]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clinical guidelines recommend introduction of a basal insulin as an effective strategy for initiating insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes (T2D) when patients fail to meet glycemic goals using non-insulin antihyperglycemic agents. Basal insulins should provide relatively constant blood levels sufficient to suppress hepatic glucose output between meals and during the night. Long-acting basal insulin analogs were developed several years ago to overcome the deficiencies of conventional basal insulin therapy and more closely mimic endogenous basal insulin secretion. Insulin glargine (IGlar; Lantus ®, Sanofi-Aventis, Paris, France), the first long-acting basal insulin analog, became available in 2000 and continues to be an important treatment option for people with diabetes. Compared with neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH), IGlar has demonstrated less variability and a more prolonged duration of action (up to 24 h) with a more even concentration–time profile. Clinically, this has allowed once-daily (QD) dosing in most patients and resulted in a lower risk of hypoglycemia.

In 2014, Lilly insulin glargine (LY IGlar; Basaglar ®, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA and Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim am Rheim, Germany) received marketing authorization in the European Union as the first biosimilar insulin product, which was followed by approvals in Japan and the United States under the appropriate pathways. Protein-derived biosimilars or follow-on biologics, such as insulins, are highly similar versions of previously approved biopharmaceuticals with an amino acid sequence (primary protein structure) that is identical to that of the corresponding reference product. Their development may reduce costs and increase patient access to such therapies. Because of the nature of protein drugs, complex manufacturing processes are utilized, and differences in these processes can affect the final products. Thus, nonclinical and clinical studies comparing similar biologics with their reference products must demonstrate similar structural and functional characteristics and clinically similar outcomes, as required by regulatory agencies. Several such studies were conducted as part of the LY IGlar development program. Assessment of outcome effects across different racial backgrounds and clinical characteristics, such as prior insulin exposure, is also important as further characterization of the extent of effect comparability. Herein we report results from a phase III clinical trial (ELEMENT 5) that compares the efficacy and safety of LY IGlar and IGlar in a T2D population with expanded Asian participation and on additional basal insulin background therapies compared with that from an earlier study.

### Real-world evaluation of dosing in patients converted from insulin glargine (lantus) to insulin glargine (basaglar) [^116WHf87]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Basaglar, insulin glargine (BGlar; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN), a follow-on biologic, was developed after the patent for Lantus, insulin glargine (LGlar; Sanofi-Aventis, Paris, France) expired. Objective: To compare the dosing and hemoglobin A 1C (A1C)-lowering effects of BGlar compared with LGlar in a real-world setting. Methods: Adult patients, at 5 clinics, with type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who were converted from LGlar to BGlar were included in this retrospective observational study. The primary outcome compared mean basal insulin dose (U/d) from the date of conversion to 6 months. Basal insulin and total daily insulin doses were also compared from baseline to 3- and 12-months postconversion, as also change in A1C, body weight, and estimated monthly acquisition costs of basal insulin. Results: Of the 225 patients included, 56% were male, and 81% had T2DM. The mean conversion dose (U/d) of LGlar was 46.3 ± 32.7. There was no significant difference in the mean BGlar dose (U/d) at 6 months (45.9 ± 33.5; P = 0.52), nor was there a statistical difference at 3 or 12 months. There were no significant differences in change in A1C at any time point. The estimated monthly acquisition cost of BGlar was significantly less than that for LGlar at conversion ($286 vs $341, P < 0.001) and 6 months ($290 vs $351, P < 0.001) respectively. Conclusion/Relevance: The results of this retrospective study suggest that BGlar resulted in similar glycemic outcomes compared with LGlar in a real-world setting and may be a preferable option in a value-based health care environment.

### Insulin glargine utilization and spending before and after the first biosimilar insulin glargine: a real-world data study [^116dnJ53]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Insulin glargine Lantus® has been a top 10 Medicare Part D medication by spending for multiple years and was the only glargine until 2015. In 2016, Basaglar®, the first biosimilar referencing Lantus® was released. In 2020, the first biosimilar to achieve FDA-interchangeable designation, Semglee®, became available. This is the first large health-system study of utilization, costs, and savings attributable to alternative glargines.

Objective

Using the University of California Health Data Warehouse, we assessed utilization, costs, and savings before and after alternative glargines introduction to inform access and policy considerations for patients with diabetes.

Design

Retrospective, observational, longitudinal study.

Patients

110 659 glargine users with type I or II diabetes.

Main Measures

Number and proportion of patients receiving Lantus®, Basaglar®, and Semglee® glargines daily, by age category with spending and savings estimates.

Key Results

Lantus® user proportion reduction after Basaglar® availability was associated with monthly spending reduction from $191 to $147 for patients under 65 and from $191 to $158 in those 65 and older from January 2015 to January 2022. Glargine users increased from 8 541 to 39 536 from 2012 to 2022. Basaglar® users increased from 6 on January 1st 2017 to 6 010 on January 1st 2022. Semglee® users increased from 29 on January 1st 2021 to 207 on January 1st 2022. Number treated for $100 000 increased after biosimilar availability, from 132 to 171 among patients under 65 and from 124 to 151 among patients 65 and older from 2015 to 2022. Annual savings attributable to biosimilars was $19.05 million in 2022 in the study population.

Conclusion

Basaglar® release was associated with spending reductions that accelerated after Semglee® availability. Biosimilar availability was associated with increases in glargine users and users per fixed-dollar amount. This study provides supportive evidence for biosimilar adoption policies.

### Insulin glargin (Lantus) [^1161fQhk]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

2.3 Converting to LANTUS from other insulin therapies

If changing from a treatment regimen with an intermediate- or
long-acting insulin to a regimen with LANTUS, the amount and timing of
shorter-acting insulins and doses of any oral anti-diabetic drugs may need to be
adjusted.

If transferring patients from once-daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS,
the recommended initial LANTUS dose is the same as the dose of NPH that is being
discontinued.
If transferring patients from twice-daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS,
the recommended initial LANTUS dose is 80% of the total NPH dose that is being
discontinued. This dose reduction will lower the likelihood of hypoglycemia
[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Similar efficacy and safety of basaglarand lantusin patients with type 2 diabetes in age groups [^113ENYdU]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

To compare efficacy and safety of Basaglar ® [insulin glargine 100 units/mL; LY insulin glargine (LY IGlar)] to Lantus ® [insulin glargine 100 units/mL; SA insulin glargine (SA IGlar)] in older (≥ 65 years) or younger (< 65 years) patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Methods

This subgroup analysis of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multinational, 24-week study compared LY IGlar and SA IGlar on several clinical efficacy (change in glycated hemoglobin (A1c), basal insulin dose, weight) and safety outcomes (incidence of adverse events, insulin antibodies, hypoglycemia incidence and rates) in patients either ≥ 65 or < 65 years.

Results

Compared with patients aged < 65 years (N = 542), patients aged ≥ 65 years (N = 214) had a significantly longer duration of diabetes; lower baseline A1c and body weight; and body mass index; and were more likely to report prestudy SA IGlar use. Compared to patients < 65 years, patients ≥ 65 years needed a lower basal insulin dose and experienced lower body weight gain. There were no significant treatment-by-age interactions for the clinical efficacy and safety outcomes, indicating that there was no differential treatment effect (LY IGlar vs SA IGlar) for patients ≥ 65 years vs those < 65 years. Moreover, within each age subgroup, LY IGlar and SA IGlar were similar for all clinical efficacy and safety outcomes.

Conclusions

LY IGlar and SA IGlar exhibit similar efficacy and safety in patients with T2D who are ≥ 65 years and in those < 65 years.

### What do the guidelines say about use of biosimilar insulin therapy? Simple practical considerations to guide clinicians in different patient subgroups-sharing Canadian perspectives [^115JtzeY]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The rising cost of insulins are significantly impacting health care expenditure, thereby limiting access to treatment for more people affected by diabetes. Fear and misunderstanding of insulin therapy have worsened with the emergence of biosimilar insulins. Biosimilars are not the same as generic medications. Generic medication contains identical ingredients to the reference, whereas biosimilar medication is highly comparable but not necessarily identical to the reference.

Results

There are five biosimilar insulins currently available in Canada: insulin glargine (U-100) as the biosimilar insulins, Basaglar® and Semglee®, insulin lispro (U-100) as the biosimilar insulin, Admelog® and insulin aspart (U-100) as the biosimilar insulins, Trurapi® and Kirsty ™. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated comparable efficacy, safety and immunogenicity for biosimilar insulins compared with reference insulins. The dosing of biosimilar insulins is also the same as the reference for initiating, switching (1:1) and titrating. Regulatory agencies, payors and clinical practice guideline committees are initiating biosimilar initiatives aimed at reducing costs, impacting more patients worldwide. While few studies have evaluated biosimilar insulin use in a real-world clinical practice setting, the descriptive patterns retrieved from the LMC Diabetes Registry reflect the Ontario Ministry of Health's changes in biologic drug policy that were implemented to promote the use of biosimilar insulins.

Conclusion

Many health care providers are largely unfamiliar with biosimilar insulins. This limits the acceptance of biosimilar insulins by patients, as it is related to the comfort of health care providers in educating patients. Tailoring effective conversations to patient needs ensures the best possible therapeutic outcomes.

Plain Language Summary

This review article intends to review the efficacy and safety data from pivotal clinical trials with biosimilar insulins, as well as the regulatory and health economic considerations which underpin the safe and cost-effective use of biosimilar insulin therapy. Biosimilars are not the same as generic medications. Generic medication contains identical ingredients to the reference, whereas biosimilar medication is highly comparable but not necessarily identical to the reference. There are five biosimilar insulins currently available in Canada: insulin glargine (U-100) as the biosimilar insulins, Basaglar® and Semglee®, insulin lispro (U-100) as the biosimilar insulin, Admelog® and insulin aspart (U-100) as the biosimilar insulins, Trurapi® and Kirsty™. Data for biosimilars must be submitted in a stepwise approach to demonstrate similarity to the reference biologic under the following categories: structure & function, human clinical trials, comparative studies evaluating efficacy and safety and manufacturing quality control. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated comparable efficacy, safety and immunogenicity for biosimilar insulins compared with reference insulins. The dosing of biosimilar insulins is also the same as the reference for initiating, switching (1:1) and titrating. Health care providers are encouraged to stay up to date on the latest guidelines and recommendations regarding biosimilar insulin interchangeability to ensure safe and cost-effective use of these products. Regulatory agencies, payors and clinical practice guideline committees are initiating biosimilar initiatives aimed at reducing costs, impacting more patients worldwide. While few studies have evaluated biosimilar insulin use in a real-world clinical practice setting, the descriptive patterns retrieved from the LMC Diabetes Registry reflect the Ontario Ministry of Health's changes in biologic drug policy that were implemented to promote the use of biosimilar insulins. A summary of adults with diabetes from this registry showed 3.8% of individuals with T1D were prescribed Basaglar® before April 2023 compared to 12.0% after January 2024. For the T2D cohort, the use of basal biosimilar insulins, Basaglar® and Semglee®, similarly increased by approximately 10% and 2% after January 2024, respectively. The use of bolus biosimilar insulins also increased after January 2024 by approximately 28% in the T1D cohort and 60% in the T2D cohort using insulin therapy. Many health care providers are largely unfamiliar with biosimilar insulins. This limits the acceptance of biosimilar insulins by patients, as it is related to the comfort of health care providers in educating patients. People living with diabetes must have access to safe and effective treatment options, and they should be able to obtain appropriate medications at an affordable price and in a fair and timely manner.

### Insulin glargine (Basaglar) [^116sCzgs]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

In a randomized, controlled clinical study (Study G), patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to 5 years of treatment with another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, once-daily or twice-daily NPH insulin. For patients not previously treated with insulin, the starting dose of this other insulin glargine product or NPH insulin was 10 units daily. Patients who were already treated with NPH insulin either continued on the same total daily NPH insulin dose or started this other insulin glargine product at a dose that was 80% of the total previous NPH insulin dose. The primary endpoint for this study was a comparison of the progression of diabetic retinopathy by 3 or more steps on the ETDRS scale. HbA1cchange from baseline was a secondary endpoint. Similar glycemic control in the 2 treatment groups was desired in order to not confound the interpretation of the retinal data. Patients or study personnel used an algorithm to adjust this other insulin glargine product and NPH insulin doses to a target fasting plasma glucose ≤ 100 mg/dL. After this other insulin glargine product or NPH insulin dose was adjusted, other anti-diabetic agents, including pre-meal insulin were to be adjusted or added. The average age was 55.1 years. The majority of patients were Caucasian (85.3%) and 53.9% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 34.3 kg/m2. The mean duration of diabetes was 10.8 years. This other insulin glargine product group had a smaller mean reduction from baseline in HbA1ccompared to the NPH insulin group, which may be explained by the lower daily basal insulin doses in this other insulin glargine product group (see Table 11). Both treatment groups had a similar incidence of reported symptomatic hypoglycemia. The incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the ORIGIN Trial is given in Table 5 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Never Share a BASAGLAR Prefilled Pen Between Patients

Advise patients that they must never share a BASAGLAR prefilled pen with another person, even if the needle is changed, because doing so carries a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia

Inform patients that hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction with insulin. Inform patients of the symptoms of hypoglycemia. Inform patients that the ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Advise patients who have frequent hypoglycemia or reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycemia to use caution when driving or operating machinery.

Advise patients that changes in insulin regimen can predispose to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia and that changes in insulin regimen should be made under close medical supervision [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Medication errors

Inform patients to always check the insulin label before each injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Lilly insulin glargine versus lantusin insulin-Naïve and insulin-treated adults with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, controlled trial (ELEMENT 5) [^114cPiQD]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This study compared the efficacy and safety of similar U-100 insulin glargine products, namely, Lilly insulin glargine (LY IGlar; Basaglar ®) and the reference insulin glargine product (IGlar; Lantus ®), used once daily in combination with oral antihyperglycemic medications (OAMs) in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Methods

ELEMENT 5 was a phase III, randomized, multinational, open-label, treat-to-target, 24-week trial. Participants were insulin naïve (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] ≥ 7.0% to ≤ 11.0%) or on basal insulin (IGlar, neutral protamine Hagedorn or insulin detemir; HbA1c ≤ 11.0%) and taking ≥ 2 OAMs. The primary objective was to show that LY IGlar is noninferior to IGlar in terms of HbA1c reduction (0.4% noninferiority margin).

Results

The study population (N = 493) was predominantly Asian (48%) or White (46%), with similar baseline characteristics between arms (P > 0.05). At 24 weeks, LY IGlar was noninferior to IGlar in terms of change in HbA1c level from baseline (-1.25 vs. -1.22%, respectively; least squares mean difference -0.04%; 95% confidence interval -0.22%, 0.15%). Other 24-week efficacy and safety results were also similar between treatments (P > 0.05), including insulin dose; percentage of patients having HbA1c of < 7% and ≤ 6.5%; overall rate and incidence of total, nocturnal, and severe hypoglycemia; adverse events; insulin antibody response; and weight gain. Daily mean 7-point self-monitored blood glucose reduction was similar between treatments at 24 weeks, with no differences at any time point except premorning-meal (fasting) blood glucose (LY IGlar -2.37 mmol/L; IGlar -2.69 mmol/L; P = 0.007).

Conclusion

Overall, LY IGlar and IGlar combined with OAMs provided similar glucose control and safety findings in this T2D population, which included a greater proportion of Asian patients and had broader background basal insulin experience than a previously studied T2D population.

A comparison of the PK and PD properties of insulin glargine from 2 manufacturers is shown in Fig. 18. In the study shown, the test product (LY IGlar, Basaglar ®) met the criterion for similarity with the reference product (EU IGlar, Lantus ®) based on the regulatory guidance that the 90% CI for the ratio of the geometric means of the of PK and PD parameters for the 2 products are contained within predefined acceptance limits of 80% to 125%.

The ORIGIN Study

The Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention trial (i.e. ORIGIN) was an open-label, randomized, 2-by-2, factorial design study. One intervention in ORIGIN compared the effect of another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, to standard care on major adverse cardiovascular outcomes in 12,537 participants ≥ 50 years of age with abnormal glucose levels [i.e., impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)] or early type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular (i.e. CV) disease or CV risk factors at baseline.

The objective of the trial was to demonstrate that use of this other insulin glargine product could significantly lower the risk of major cardiovascular outcomes compared to standard care. Two co-primary composite cardiovascular endpoints were used in ORIGIN. The first co-primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke. The second co-primary endpoint was the time to the first occurrence of CV death or nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke or revascularization procedure or hospitalization for heart failure.

Participants were randomized to either this other insulin glargine product (N = 6264) titrated to a goal fasting plasma glucose of ≤ 95 mg/dL or to standard care (N = 6273). Anthropometric and disease characteristics were balanced at baseline. The mean age was 64 years and 8% of participants were 75 years of age or older. The majority of participants were male (65%). Fifty nine percent were Caucasian, 25% were Latin, 10% were Asian and 3% were Black. The median baseline BMI was 29 kg/m2. Approximately 12% of participants had abnormal glucose levels (IGT and/or IFG) at baseline and 88% had type 2 diabetes. For patients with type 2 diabetes, 59% were treated with a single oral antidiabetic drug, 23% had known diabetes but were on no antidiabetic drug and 6% were newly diagnosed during the screening procedure. The mean HbA1c(SD) at baseline was 6.5% (1.0). Fifty nine percent of participants had had a prior cardiovascular event and 39% had documented coronary artery disease or other cardiovascular risk factors.

14.3 Clinical Studies in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes

Patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a double-blind, active-controlled study to evaluate the glucose lowering effect of once-daily BASAGLAR plus oral antidiabetic medication (OAM) compared to that of another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, or a non-U.S.-licensed insulin glargine, 100 units/mL (comparator insulin glargine products, 100 units/mL) administered once-daily along with OAMs. Patients were either insulin naïve (approximately 60%) and had failed to achieve adequate glycemic control on at least 2 OAMs, or were already on another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, or a non-U.S.-licensed insulin glargine, 100 units/mL, along with at least 2 OAMs with adequate or inadequate glycemic control (approximately 40%). A total of 759 patients were randomized. Three patients randomized to BASAGLAR did not receive study drug and were not included in efficacy analysis. The average age was approximately 59 years. The majority of patients were White (78%) and 50% of the patients were male. Sixty-eight percent of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73m2. The mean BMI was approximately 32 kg/m2. At week 24, treatment with BASAGLAR provided a mean reduction in HbA1cthat was non-inferior to that achieved with comparator insulin glargine products, 100 units/mL (see Table 10).

5.3 Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins, including BASAGLAR [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). BASAGLAR, or any insulin, should not be used during episodes of hypoglycemia [see Contraindications (4)].

Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions (7)], or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia.

Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia

The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulins, the glucose lowering effect time course of BASAGLAR may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. The risk of hypoglycemia generally increases with intensity of glycemic control. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia

Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended.

The long-acting effect of BASAGLAR may delay recovery from hypoglycemia.

5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors

Accidental mix-ups between insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between BASAGLAR and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection.

### Lilly insulin glargine versus lantusin insulin-Naïve and insulin-treated adults with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, controlled trial (ELEMENT 5) [^116U8dZC]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Plain Language Summary

The phase III clinical trial reported here compared two similar basal insulin products, namely, Lilly insulin glargine (Basaglar ®) and a reference insulin glargine product (Lantus ®), used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes. Some patients were using basal insulin prior to entry, and others were insulin naïve. The main racial groups were Asian (48% of the study population), White (46%), and African American (6%). Patients were recruited from India, Korea, Taiwan, Russia, Turkey, the United States, and Puerto Rico. Efficacy and safety measures were acquired over 24 weeks. The main efficacy measures evaluated blood glucose, including glycated hemoglobin, an indicator of blood glucose levels over approximately 3 months, and self-monitored blood glucose taken at several time points over the course of the day. Safety measures included incidence and rate of low blood sugar, incidence of adverse events, and incidence and levels of insulin antibodies. Dose and weight assessments were also obtained. In general, the two treatments provided similar results for these measures. Only one result showed a statistically significant difference between treatments, namely, the reduction in premorning meal self-monitored blood glucose was greater in patients on Lantus ® at 24 weeks. To further evaluate this finding, we analyzed treatment effects on this measure across different sets of patient subgroups. No significant differential treatment effects were observed. Considering this and other results, the difference was not expected to be clinically meaningful. Findings from this study extend the body of evidence from other trials supporting the similarity of these two insulin glargine products.

14.1 Overview of Clinical Studies

The safety and effectiveness of another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, given once-daily at bedtime was compared to that of once-daily and twice-daily NPH insulin in open-label, randomized, active-controlled, parallel studies of 2,327 adults and 349 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 1,563 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (see Tables 8, 9, 11, and 12). In general, the reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) with this other insulin glargine product was similar to that with NPH insulin.

14.2 Clinical Studies in Adult and Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes

Patients with inadequately controlled type 1 diabetes participated in a 24-week open-label, active-controlled study with a 28 week extension to evaluate the glucose lowering effect of once-daily BASAGLAR compared to that of once-daily administration of another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, or a non-U.S.-licensed insulin glargine, 100 units/mL, (comparator insulin glargine products, 100 units/mL) both in combination with mealtime insulin lispro. Randomized were 535 adults with type 1 diabetes. Mean age was 41.2 years and mean duration of diabetes was 16.39 years. 57.9% were male. 74.5% were Caucasian, 2.1% Black or African American and 4.3% American Indian or Alaskan native. 3.9% were Hispanic. 73.5 percent of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73m2. The mean BMI was approximately 25.54 kg/m2. At week 24, treatment with BASAGLAR provided a mean reduction in HbA1cthat was non-inferior to that achieved with comparator insulin glargine products, 100 units/mL (see Table 7).

### Insulin glargine (Basaglar) [^11674uGm]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

In a randomized, controlled clinical study (Study E) (n = 570), another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, was evaluated for 52 weeks in combination with oral anti-diabetic medications (a sulfonylurea, metformin, acarbose, or combination of these drugs). The average age was 59.5 years. The majority of patients were Caucasian (92.8%) and 53.7% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 29.1 kg/m2. The mean duration of diabetes was 10.3 years. This other insulin glargine product administered once daily at bedtime was as effective as NPH insulin administered once daily at bedtime in reducing HbA1cand fasting glucose (see Table 11). The rate of hypoglycemia was similar in this other insulin glargine product and NPH insulin treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In a randomized, controlled clinical study (Study F), in patients with type 2 diabetes not using oral anti-diabetic medications (n = 518), a basal-bolus regimen of another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, once daily at bedtime or NPH insulin administered once or twice daily was evaluated for 28 weeks. Regular human insulin was used before meals, as needed. The average age was 59.3 years. The majority of patients were Caucasian (80.7%) and 60% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 30.5 kg/m2. The mean duration of diabetes was 13.7 years. This other insulin glargine product had similar effectiveness as either once- or twice daily NPH insulin in reducing HbA1cand fasting glucose (see Table 11) with a similar incidence of hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Type 1 Diabetes – Pediatric (see Table 9)

The efficacy of BASAGLAR to improve glycemic control in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus is based on an adequate and well-controlled trial of another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (Study D). In this randomized, active-controlled clinical study (Study D), pediatric patients (age range 6 to 15 years) with type 1 diabetes (n = 349) were treated for 28 weeks with a basal-bolus insulin regimen where regular human insulin was used before each meal. Patients were randomized to either this other insulin glargine product administered once daily at bedtime or NPH insulin administered once or twice daily. The average age was 11.7 years. The majority of patients were Caucasian (96.8%) and 51.9% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 18.9 kg/m2. The mean duration of diabetes was 4.8 years. Similar effects on HbA1c(see Table 9) were observed in both treatment groups.

### Which patients will benefit from a switch in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus oral antidiabetic drugs? Further analysis of the lantus registry study [^117JQfj8]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

The main limitations of the Lantus Registry Study have been reported previously. Briefly, the lack of comparator arm in the trial means that it is difficult to determine whether observed improvements in glycemic control following the switch in treatment are solely on account of treatment effectiveness or influenced by study design. This is because observation can alter the behavior of both patients and physicians involved in a clinical trial, which can influence outcome measures. Another general limitation of observational and single-arm studies is the strong likelihood of bias and confounding in study design. Treatment was at the discretion of the physicians, which further exposes the study to bias.

Additionally, the duration of the Lantus Registry Study was relatively short and did not allow proper evaluation of the clinical challenges associated with optimal titration of insulin glargine along with OAD dosage adjustments. A longer study is required for more robust evaluation of these clinical challenges and insulin glargine titration. As a result of the widespread use of premixed insulin in China, there is lack of clinical experience with insulin glargine, which may have led to insufficient titration and therefore a lower achievement of glycemic control than would have otherwise been seen. However, the current subgroup analysis of the Lantus Registry Study does provide insight into the characteristics of patients associated with the clinical benefits of transitioning therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus oral OADs, based on real-world data. It also highlights the need to improve the management of T2DM in clinical practice, especially with regard to titrating the dose of insulin glargine to enable patients to achieve adequate glycemic control. This study also raises the need for further investigation of the effects of switching therapy on the incidence of hypoglycemia in Asian populations to encourage optimal titration of the dose of insulin glargine.

2.4 Switching to LANTUS from Other Insulin Therapies

Dosage adjustments are recommended to lower the risk of hypoglycemia when switching patients to LANTUS from other insulin therapies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

When switching from:

Once-daily TOUJEO (insulin glargine 300 units/mL) to once-daily LANTUS (100 units/mL), the recommended starting LANTUS dosage is 80% of the TOUJEO dosage that is being discontinued.
Once-daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS, the recommended starting LANTUS dosage is the same as the dosage of NPH that is being discontinued.
Twice-daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS, the recommended starting LANTUS dosage is 80% of the total NPH dosage that is being discontinued.

Another Insulin Glargine Product, 100 units/mL, Timing of Daily Dosing (see Table 12)

The safety and efficacy of this other insulin glargine product administered pre-breakfast, pre-dinner, or at bedtime were evaluated in a randomized, controlled clinical study in patients with type 1 diabetes (Study H; n = 378). Patients were also treated with insulin lispro at mealtime. The average age was 40.9 years. All patients were Caucasian (100%) and 53.7% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 25.3 kg/m2. The mean duration of diabetes was 17.3 years. This other insulin glargine product administered at different times of the day resulted in similar reductions in HbA1ccompared to that with bedtime administration (see Table 12). In these patients, data are available from 8-point home glucose monitoring. The maximum mean blood glucose was observed just prior to injection of this other insulin glargine product regardless of time of administration.

In this study, 5% of patients in this other insulin glargine product-breakfast arm discontinued treatment because of lack of efficacy. No patients in the other two arms discontinued for this reason. The safety and efficacy of this other insulin glargine product administered pre-breakfast or at bedtime were also evaluated in a randomized, active-controlled clinical study (Study I, n = 697) in patients with type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled on oral anti-diabetic therapy. All patients in this study also received glimepiride 3 mg daily. The average age was 60.8 years. The majority of patients were Caucasian (96.6%) and 53.7% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 28.7 kg/m2. The mean duration of diabetes was 10.1 years. This other insulin glargine product given before breakfast was at least as effective in lowering HbA1cas this other insulin glargine product given at bedtime or NPH insulin given at bedtime (see Table 12).

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of patients with type 2 diabetes who were treated with BASAGLAR or another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, each in combination with oral agents in a controlled clinical trial environment, 28.3% were 65 and over, while 4.5% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when BASAGLAR is administered to geriatric patients. In elderly patients with diabetes, the initial dosing, dose increments, and maintenance dosage should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly.

8.6 Renal Impairment

The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of BASAGLAR has not been studied. Some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with renal failure. Frequent glucose monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary for BASAGLAR in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of BASAGLAR has not been studied. However, as with all insulin products, more frequent glucose monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary for BASAGLAR in patients with hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analog lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacodynamic profile for BASAGLAR was determined after subcutaneous administration of a single 0.5 U/kg dose in a euglycemic clamp study conducted in 91 healthy subjects. The median time to maximum effect of BASAGLAR (measured by the peak rate of glucose infusion) was approximately 12.0 hours. The pharmacodynamic profile of BASAGLAR following subcutaneous injection demonstrated sustained glucose lowering activity over 24 hours with no pronounced peak. The mean area under the glucose infusion rate curves (measure of overall pharmacodynamic effect) and maximum glucose infusion rate were 1670 mg/kg and 2.12 mg/kg/min, respectively.

A euglycemic clamp study in 20 patients with type 1 diabetes showed a similar pharmacodynamic profile with a sustained glucose lowering activity over 24 hours following a single 0.3 U/kg subcutaneous dose of BASAGLAR.

After subcutaneous injection of 0.3 units/kg of another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, in patients with type 1 diabetes, the duration of action after abdominal, deltoid, or thigh subcutaneous administration was similar.

The time course of action of insulins, including insulin glargine, may vary between individuals and within the same individual.

### Efficacy and safety of LY2963016 insulin glargine versus insulin glargine (lantus) in Chinese adults with type 2 diabetes: a phase III, randomized, open-label, controlled trial [^115Xt8ro]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a progressive disease characterized by deterioration and eventual loss of pancreatic β‐cell function, resulting in inadequate production of insulin and chronic hyperglycaemia. The International Diabetes Federation estimated that the number of people worldwide with diabetes in 2019 was 463 million, of which China accounted for 116.4 million, ranking first. The latest epidemiological survey of Chinese adults showed that the standardized prevalence of total diabetes and prediabetes using the American Diabetes Association criteria was 12.8% and 35.2%, respectively.

Exogenous insulin is considered the most effective treatment for lowering high blood glucose if adequate glycaemic control cannot be achieved through combinations of diet, exercise and oral antihyperglycaemic medications (OAMs). Long‐acting basal insulin analogues were developed to more closely match the kinetics of endogenous insulin compared with conventional intermediate‐acting basal insulins such as human neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH). Insulin glargine (IGlar; Lantus) was the first long‐acting insulin analogue to be approved for use in patients with T2D, in 2000. IGlar is associated with similar effectiveness for glycaemic control as NPH but with a moderate reduction in incidence of hypoglycaemia, and allows once‐daily injection versus two or more daily injections for NPH.

LY2963016 insulin glargine (LY IGlar; Abasaglar [European Union]; Basaglar [United States]) is a long‐acting human insulin analogue with an identical amino acid sequence, pharmaceutical form and strength (concentration of the active ingredient) as IGlar.LY IGlar was the first biosimilar insulin to receive approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in September 2014'. iosimilar' is a regulatory designation with different definitions under different jurisdictions. The EMA defines a biosimilar as 'a biological medicinal product that contains a version of the active substance of an already authorized original biological medicinal product (reference medicinal product)'. Similarity must be established in terms of quality characteristics, biological activity, safety and efficacy. The China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) requires independent approval of biosimilar medications, using criteria closely aligned with the EMA regulations.

1 INTRODUCTION

Injectable exogenous basal insulin is an important component of antihyperglycaemic treatment for patients with type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Insulin glargine (IGlar; Lantus® [Sanofi‐Aventis, Paris, France]) is a long‐acting basal insulin analogue, developed using recombinant DNA technology, and was the first long‐acting insulin analogue to receive regulatory approval, in 2000.LY2963016 insulin glargine (LY IGlar; Abasaglar [European Union]; Basaglar [United States]) has a primary amino acid sequence, pharmaceutical form and strength identical to reference IGlar.LY IGlar was the first biosimilar insulin to receive approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in September 2014, and received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2015.LY IGLar has shown similar efficacy and safety to IGlar in patients with T1DM and T2DM across multiple randomized, phase III noninferiority trials, in both Western and Asian patient populations.

### Which patients will benefit from a switch in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus oral antidiabetic drugs? Further analysis of the lantus registry study [^117JWpdD]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Approximately three-quarters (74.5%) of patients unable to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0% in this study also failed to achieve FPG ≤ 6.1 mmol/L. The lack of adequate FPG control in patients unable to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0% is not surprising given the increased contribution of fasting hyperglycemia to poorly controlled T2DM. Considering their high FPG levels, these patients would have a lower tendency to experience hypoglycemia. Our analysis also showed that the incidence of hypoglycemia did not increase in patients with endpoint HbA 1c ≥ 7.0% compared with patients achieving endpoint HbA 1c < 7.0% (P = 0.6889), even though patients in the ≥ 7.0% group were older, with a longer duration of diabetes, and a higher proportion of complications and comorbidities. The average endpoint insulin glargine dose for patients who failed both HbA 1c and FPG targets was 0.26 ± 0.09 U/kg/day, which was approximately 40% lower than the doses (0.4–0.5 U/kg/day) required to achieve adequate glycemic control while maintaining a low risk of hypoglycemia reported by other studies. This indicates that there is still potential for up-titration of the dose of insulin glargine in patients who failed to reach both glycemic targets. Hence, further up-titration of the insulin glargine dose in patients who failed to reach both HbA 1c and FPG targets may not increase the risk of hypoglycemia, and improve the likelihood of achieving adequate FPG control and therefore target HbA 1c.

Baseline Characteristics of the Patients Stratified by Endpoint HbA 1c

Patients were stratified according to an endpoint HbA 1c level of either < 7.0% or ≥ 7.0%. Among them, 1019 patients (55.2%) reached HbA 1c < 7.0% and 828 patients (44.8%) did not. Patient demographics and characteristics of the two groups at baseline are shown in Table 1. Patients with an endpoint HbA 1c < 7.0% were younger (55.10 ± 11.16 vs 57.90 ± 10.61 years; P < 0.001) and had lower baseline BMI (24.94 ± 2.94 vs 25.34 ± 3.58 kg/m 2; P < 0.05), shorter mean duration of diabetes (6.05 ± 5.60 vs 9.14 ± 6.49 years; P < 0.001), and lower baseline HbA 1c (7.34 ± 1.16% vs 8.28 ± 1.06%; P < 0.001) and FPG (7.60 ± 1.87 vs 8.70 ± 2.19 mmol/L; P < 0.001) than patients with an endpoint HbA 1c of ≥ 7.0%. The HbA 1c < 7.0% group also had a lower proportion of patients with diabetes complications (36.2% vs 45.4%; P < 0.001) and comorbidities (57.2% vs 63.6%; P < 0.01). A lower proportion of female patients achieved HbA 1c < 7.0% compared with those who achieved HbA 1c ≥ 7% (41.3% vs 47.7%; P < 0.05). Furthermore, patients with an endpoint HbA 1c of < 7.0% received a markedly lower dose of premixed insulin prior to treatment switch (0.41 ± 0.14 vs 0.46 ± 0.16 U/kg/day; P < 0.001). There was also a difference in the number OADs taken at baseline between patients who achieved HbA 1c < 7.0% and those who did not (P < 0.001); a higher proportion of patients who achieved HbA 1c < 7.0% took only one OAD at baseline (63.6% vs 49.3%).

Discussion

The Lantus Registry Study in China was a prospective, observational study that reported improved glycemic control and treatment satisfaction with a low incidence of hypoglycemia in adult Chinese patients with T2DM who switched from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus OADs. This subgroup analysis of the Lantus Registry Study aimed to identify the characteristics of patients who may gain the greatest benefit by transitioning therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus OADs.

In this study, following a switch in treatment from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus OADs, 55.2% of patients achieved an endpoint HbA 1c level of < 7.0% in comparison to the 28.6% of patients at baseline. Additionally, 63.2% demonstrated an improvement in HbA 1c. These results indicate the benefits of this transition in treatment.

Methods

Patients and Study Design

The Lantus Registry Study was a 16-week, open label, prospective, observational multicenter study conducted across China from September 2010 to June 2012.

In brief, patients were eligible for enrollment if they were 18 to 75 years of age, had received premixed insulin with or without OADs for at least 3 months, and had an HbA 1c level ≤ 10.0%. The main exclusion criteria included diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus, temporary insulin treatment for gestational diabetes or surgery, allergy to insulin glargine (100 U/ml)/OAD or its excipients, and acute diabetes-related complications such as hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state or diabetic ketoacidosis. The study protocol was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and approved by the local ethical committees or institutional review boards at each participating institution. All patients or their legally acceptable surrogates gave written informed consent.

Study Treatment

Eligible participants were switched from their previous premixed insulin therapy (with or without OADs) to insulin glargine plus OADs at the discretion of both the physician and the patient, and in accordance with local product labels. Insulin glargine was initiated at a dose equivalent to 60.0% (in patients with baseline HbA 1c ≤ 8.0%) or 80.0% (in patients with baseline HbA 1c > 8.0%) of the total dose of the intermediate insulin component of the patient's previous premixed dose. Insulin glargine was up-titrated every 3 days by 2, 4, 6, and 8 U for a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of 5.5–6.6, 6.7–7.7, 7.8–9.9, and ≥ 10.0 mmol/L, respectively, until an FPG level of ≤ 5.6 mmol/L was achieved. This titration algorithm was in line with the Treat-to-Target algorithm. The OAD type and dosage were adjusted at the physicians' discretion according to the label and standard practice.

6.2 Immunogenicity

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity.

In a 52-week study of type 1 diabetes patients, 42% of patients who received BASAGLAR once daily were positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at least once during the study, including 17% that were positive at baseline and 25% of patients who developed ADA during the study. Sixty-five percent of the ADA positive patients on BASAGLAR with antibody testing at week 52 remained ADA positive at week 52.

In a 24-week study of type 2 diabetes patients, 17% of patients who received BASAGLAR once daily were positive for ADA at least once during the study. Among the subjects who were positive, 5% had ADA at baseline and 12% developed antibodies during the study. The percent binding of patients positive at baseline on BASAGLAR did not increase significantly during the study. Fifty-one percent of the ADA positive patients on BASAGLAR with antibody testing at week 24 remained ADA positive at week 24. There was no evidence that these antibodies had an impact on efficacy and safety outcomes.

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay and may be influenced by several factors such as: assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medication, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to BASAGLAR with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.

6.3 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of insulin glargine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Medication errors have been reported in which other insulin products, particularly rapid-acting insulins, have been accidentally administered instead of insulin glargine.

Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred. Hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis; hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site.

### A review of basal-bolus therapy using insulin glargine and insulin lispro in the management of diabetes mellitus [^113BbNQN]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Basal-Bolus Therapy with Insulin Lispro and Insulin Glargine in Adults with Diabetes

In patients with severe insulin deficiency, insulin therapy should replace both basal and prandial insulin requirements, matching the physiologic pattern of insulin secretion as closely as possible. The basal-bolus approach involves multiple daily injections (MDI), with a long-acting insulin used as the basal insulin and a rapid-acting insulin adminstered at mealtimes. Long-acting insulin analogues generally reduce HbA1c to a similar extent to synthetic human insulins, but may be associated with less nocturnal hypoglycemia. RAIAs are often preferred over RHI for mealtime insulin administration because they are absorbed more rapidly, can be given nearer to the meal, their action better simulates the physiological insulin response to meals, and they are associated with less hypoglycemia.

Insulin glargine 100 U/mL and insulin lispro have both been available for many years, have been widely studied, and can be considered first-line options for use as the basal and bolus components, respectively, of BBT. A search of the PubMed database up to October 3, 2017 was performed to identify papers about BBT involving insulin glargine 100 U/mL plus insulin lispro in patients with T1DM or T2DM that were published in English. The search was limited to human data, and the following search string was used: ((basal insulin) OR (basal bolus therapy) OR basal-plus OR basal-bolus OR basal bolus premixed) AND (insulin glargine OR Lantus OR "Lantus SoloStar" OR Basaglar OR Abasaglar OR insulin lispro OR Humalog OR basal g OR flexpen OR Novorapid OR LY2963016 OR (LY2963016 AND lispro)) OR (insulin glargine biosimilar) NOT Letter. Additional papers were detected from bibliographies of the identified articles. Clinical trials, observational studies, and review articles were considered; trials could be of any duration and could involve adult patients of any age or pediatric populations. Only studies in which one treatment arm clearly comprised BBT with insulin glargine 100 U/mL plus insulin lispro (and no other insulin preparation) were retained. Comparisons with non-insulin therapy were excluded. The initial search identified 994 papers, of which 39 met the criteria for inclusion. The remainder of this section focuses on studies in adults; pediatric data are discussed later.

### Global barriers to accessing off-patent endocrine therapies: a renaissance of the orphan disease? [^115n9Px7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

In the life cycle of a medicine, after the arrival of many generic products, there is a period of potential supply risk. When multiple generics are available in the market, the competition drives the prices down, resulting in shrinking profit margins. With smaller profit margins, the market exit of several products can eventually lead to a de facto monopoly. A market monopoly for some of these medicines could also be driven by a smaller patient population for the given product, thus limiting the overall sales of the drug and profitability.

The insulin industry is one of the best examples of market oligopoly, meaning the market is dominated by 3 manufacturers who effectively dictate the price. These 3 companies were known to hold a 96% share of the insulin market. The lack of generic competition for insulin is multifactorial. Insulin is a large peptide molecule unlike other small molecule medicines; hence it is called a biologic. Therefore, manufacturing requires specific expertise and resources. Additionally, the development and approval of a biosimilar insulin was complex and required many preclinical and clinical studies to prove purity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity. Developing a generic version was limited further in the United States until 2020 since insulin was not officially classified as a biologic so was not subject to biosimilar competition. Basaglar® (insulin glargine) is an example of a generic that is called a follow-on biologic of Lantus® (insulin glargine), which underwent a complex approval pathway after pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity studies in healthy subjects and people with diabetes. Both Basaglar® and Admelog® (follow-on biologic of insulin lispro) were also from 2 of the previously mentioned 3 manufacturers and, therefore, the expected price drop due to competition was not observed. However, with several regulatory bodies promoting biosimilars for insulin with special guidance and less stringent approval processes, now several generics are entering the market.

### Which patients will benefit from a switch in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus oral antidiabetic drugs? Further analysis of the lantus registry study [^116PjfXY]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Various studies, including the recent Lantus Registry Study in China, have shown that switching to insulin glargine-based therapy can improve glycemic control in patients with T2DM who are poorly controlled on premixed insulin. These studies have demonstrated that a switch in therapy can lead to a significant reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) and an improvement in treatment satisfaction, along with a low incidence of hypoglycemic events. Once-daily insulin glargine is also considered to be a more flexible regimen with lower healthcare costs than premixed insulin, providing further evidence of the benefits of switching therapy.

The current study, a subgroup analysis of the Lantus Registry Study, aims to identify independent factors associated with changes in blood glucose for patients with T2DM who have switched their treatment from premixed insulin therapy to insulin glargine plus OADs. In doing so, this study aims to determine the characteristics of patients who are more likely to obtain real-life clinical benefits from this switch in treatment.

Optimally titrating the dose of insulin glargine is therefore a critical factor influencing achievement of adequate FPG control and therefore target HbA 1c. This finding holds particular significance as it demonstrates a mechanism by which patients can achieve target HbA 1c following a switch in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus OADs. This finding is also relevant to Asia, given that physicians in Asia often have a cautious approach to the titration of insulin, especially as Asian patients with T2DM, who are leaner than Caucasian patients, are perceived to be at an increased risk of hypoglycemia. This fear is unfounded as several studies conducted in Asian patients with T2DM have shown that the rates of hypoglycemia are low with insulin glargine when taken as combination therapy with OADs in insulin-naïve patients or in patients switching from premixed insulin. A study by Riddle et al. which sought to determine the relative contributions of basal hyperglycemia versus postprandial hyperglycemia in patients inadequately controlled on OADs prior to and following treatment intensification with various therapies, demonstrated that symptomatic hypoglycemic events were greater with the other treatments than with basal insulin.

### Duration of action of two insulin glargine products, LY2963016 insulin glargine and lantus insulin glargine, in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus [^114quTqb]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

LY2963016 insulin glargine (LY IGlar) is a long‐acting human insulin analog manufactured by Eli Lilly and Company with an amino acid sequence identical to that of Lantus insulin glargine (a registered trademark of Sanofi; hereafter IGlar). IGlar is indicated for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in adult and paediatric patients. 1 LY IGlar is currently approved for use in the European Union (EU) under the name Abasaglar and the United States (USA) under the name Basaglar for treatment of diabetes mellitus as a subcutaneous (SC) injection in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and above. 2

LY IGlar was developed in accordance with biosimilar guidelines established by the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration. 3, 4, 5 These guidelines recommend a pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) comparison of a new insulin analog with a reference insulin in glucose clamp studies. We have previously demonstrated the equivalence of PK and PD parameters between LY IGlar and IGlar in euglycaemic glucose clamp studies in healthy subjects. 6 However, it is difficult to determine accurately the duration of action of exogenous insulin in healthy subjects because of the presence of endogenous insulin and the induction of hormonal responses during prolonged fasting. This study was undertaken with the primary objective of comparing the duration of action of IGlar and LY IGlar in subjects with T1DM.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption and Bioavailability

The pharmacokinetic profile for BASAGLAR was determined after subcutaneous administration of a single 0.5 U/kg dose in a euglycemic clamp study conducted in 91 healthy subjects. The insulin serum concentrations indicated a slow and prolonged absorption and a relatively constant concentration/time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced peak.

The median time to maximum serum insulin concentration was 12 hours after injection. On average, serum insulin concentrations declined to baseline by approximately 24 hours. The mean observed area under the serum insulin concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours and peak serum insulin concentration were 1720 pmol*hr/L and 103 pmol/L, respectively.

Metabolism and Elimination

After subcutaneous injection of another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, in diabetic patients, insulin glargine is metabolized at the carboxyl terminus of the Beta chain with formation of two active metabolites M1 (21A-Gly-insulin) and M2 (21A-Gly-des-30B-Thr-insulin). The in vitro activity of M1 and M2 were similar to that of insulin.

Specific Populations

Age, Race, and Gender: Effect of age, race, and gender on the pharmacokinetics of BASAGLAR has not been evaluated.

Obesity: Effect of BMI on the pharmacokinetics of BASAGLAR has not been evaluated.

### Trends in insulin types and devices used by adults with type 2 diabetes in the United States, 2016 to 2020 [^116vFZDA]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

In contrast to assessments of insulin glargine, and despite their comparability with originator products, little has been published about recent trends in biosimilar insulin compared with the use of other insulins in the United States. The first biosimilar insulin to be approved in the United States was the biosimilar insulin glargine (Basaglar) in 2015. In a study of biosimilar medication use in Canada, an enormous projected potential cost savings (or unrealized savings) was observed with the use of the biosimilar (Basaglar) vs the nonbiosimilar glargine (Lantus). In addition, Hernandez et alfound that the introduction of biosimilar insulin was associated with less reimbursement per milliliter of insulin overall by Medicaid, which suggested that greater competition in the insulin market was associated with lower cost of insulin. Although we did not evaluate cost in our study as other investigators have, we found that biosimilar insulin use increased by more than 200% from 2017 to 2020.

Furthermore, we noted that analog insulin accounted for most treatment visits throughout the study period. These findings are consistent with older studies using privately insured payer cohorts and reports from resource-limited countries. To our knowledge, our study is the first to document a continued predominance of analog insulin use in the United States using a multipayer database and using the most up-to-date data available through the end of 2020.

Insulin glargine's continued predominance, relative to newer insulins, may be due to several factors, including clinical inertia, which has been commonly described in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition, expert guidelines note that analog basal insulins, including insulin glargine, are associated with less hypoglycemia compared with NPH (isophane) human insulin. However, they also highlight that insulin glargine U300 and insulin degludec may be associated with less hypoglycemia compared with insulin glargine U100 or insulin detemir.

### Which patients will benefit from a switch in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus oral antidiabetic drugs? Further analysis of the lantus registry study [^111XugQ9]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This subgroup analysis of the Lantus Registry Study aimed to identify the characteristics of patients with T2DM in China who may potentially benefit from transitioning therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine (100 U/ml) plus OADs. Results of this study demonstrate that patients with T2DM who are younger, have a shorter duration of diabetes, lower baseline HbA 1c and FPG levels, and a lower dose of premixed insulin prior to the switch have a greater potential to achieve glycemic targets following a transition in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus OADs. The group with improvement in HbA 1c had the highest baseline HbA 1c levels compared with those with no change or deterioration in HbA 1c. Therefore, this study demonstrates that while patients with lower baseline HbA 1c may be able to achieve glycemic targets following a switch in therapy, poorly controlled patients with higher baseline HbA 1c are most likely to demonstrate an improvement in glycemic control following a switch to insulin glargine plus OADs. The majority of patients who failed to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0% also failed to reach an FPG of ≤ 6.1 mmol/L, and this highlights the importance of titrating the dose of insulin glargine to an appropriate level in order to achieve adequate FPG control, which can aid achievement of target HbA 1c.

### Estimated changes in insulin prices and discounts after entry of new insulin products, 2012–2019 [^111zfYxz]. JAMA Health Forum (2023). High credibility.

Our findings are of relevance because policy making to address cost-related insulin access has been hampered by insufficient knowledge of the net price of insulin and its association with patient out-of-pocket costs, resulting in policy proposals that have been scored by the Congressional Budget Office as increasing the cost of insulin. Overall, our analysis confirms that insulin products are highly rebated and that net prices faced by payers increased at a slower pace than list prices from 2012 to 2019. Before competition, however, increasing discounts were not able to offset increases in list prices, meaning that list price growth resulted in higher net prices.

Our net price estimations revealed commercial strategies across insulin markets. Net prices of long-acting legacy insulin products Lantus and insulin detemir (Levemir) decreased after classwide competition owing to the introduction of biosimilar Basaglar, as well as Toujeo and insulin degludec (Tresiba), in 2015. At launch, Sanofi priced high-strength insulin glargine Toujeo at a lower net price than legacy insulin glargine Lantus even as it was reducing the net price of Lantus. This strategy, acknowledged by Sanofi to the Senate Finance Committee, aimed to encourage insurers to induce switches from Lantus to Toujeo, ostensibly to avoid automatic substitution of Lantus with forthcoming interchangeable biosimilars (first approved in 2021). Novo Nordisk priced insulin degludec (Tresiba) at a higher list and net price compared with legacy insulin detemir (Levemir), which likely reflects its ultralong duration of action unmatched by other products. However, by 2018, the net price of insulin degludec (Tresiba) had decreased below the net price of insulin detemir (Levemir) in 2014, suggesting intense competition in the crowded long-acting insulin market. The introduction of noninterchangeable insulin glargine Basaglar in 2015 was followed by decreases in net prices faced by payers across the entire class of long-acting insulin products. Although Toujeo has a lower net price than Basaglar, it has not captured as much market share as Basaglar (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1), which may reflect insurers' concern about switching patients to a formulation that will not face biosimilar competition for a longer period. Together, the change in trajectory of net prices of long-acting insulin products after competition suggests that competition resulted in lower net prices, likely reducing overall insulin spending.

### Considerations for insulin-treated type 2 diabetes patients during hospitalization: a narrative review of what we need to know in the age of second-generation basal insulin analogs [^114uxJ1M]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 3
Comparison of guidance (drawn from the authors' clinical experience) for the hospital care of patients with type 2 diabetes receiving outpatient basal insulin regimens

BG blood glucose, glargine U300 insulin glargine 300 units/ml, POC point of care

a First-generation basal insulin analogs (e.g. insulin glargine 100 units/ml or insulin detemir)

In a recent paper, Hirsch and Draznin explored several clinical scenarios in which challenges may arise when switching from degludec to a basal insulin with a shorter half-life. The authors surveyed 30 other HCPs on what they would do in each situation, and also offered their own recommendation, based on the PK/PD profile of the insulins involved. The most popular answer selected by HCPs often involved making unit-to-unit conversions between degludec and formulary insulins, but this may not be appropriate, especially in hospitalized patients who are vulnerable to hypoglycemia, because of the carry-over effect of previously injected degludec. For patients admitted to the hospital on degludec, the authors recommended halving their basal insulin dose on the first day they are switched to a first-generation formulary basal insulin and then upping the dose to 75–100% of the pre-admittance insulin dose the next day (depending on BG levels). This is based on the knowledge that 50% of the last degludec dose is still contributing to the serum insulin levels 25 h post-injection, as indicated by the terminal half-life. This is a conservative approach to avoid hypoglycemia when switching from a second- to first-generation basal insulin in hospitalized patients. It is important to consider when exactly the patient's last dose was given, especially given the flexibility in degludec dosing. For example, if the last dose of insulin (degludec) was > 30 h ago, halving the next dose of insulin (e.g. glargine U100, onset of action ≤ 6 h) may result in a temporary rise in glycemia. It is impossible to provide a precise and universal calculation for conversion, as every situation is different, and the factors listed in Table 1 will also determine patients' insulin requirements. Nevertheless, we would recommend considering a reduction in total daily insulin dose of between 20 and 50% when switching non-critical patients from degludec to a first-generation basal insulin upon admittance to hospital and a similar magnitude in dose reduction when switching back to degludec upon discharge to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.

### Effectiveness, safety and treatment adherence of biosimilar follow-on insulin in diabetes management [^117YAMpn]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

To assess the change in HbA1c after initiation of biosimilar follow-on insulin (Basaglar) or reference insulin (Lantus) among patients with type 2 diabetes. We also compared treatment adherence, safety events and costs at 1 year after initiation of insulin.

Materials and Methods

Using claims data from a large US health plan during 2016–2020, we identified adults with type 2 diabetes who initiated either Basaglar or Lantus. Generalized linear regression modelling assessed the differences in outcomes between the two groups. A 0.4% margin was used to determine non-inferiority for HbA1c.

Results

The study included 1136 Basaglar users and 6304 Lantus users. Both Lantus and Basaglar groups showed more than 1% reduction in HbA1c over 6months and over 12months. Reduction in HbA1c with Basaglar was similar (non-inferior) to that with Lantus, with an adjusted difference of Basaglar to Lantus of 0.14% (95% CI -0.02 to 0.30) over 6 months and 0.17% (95% CI 0.02 to 0.32) over 12months. Rates of adverse events were similar for both hypoglycaemia and vascular events. The Basaglar group showed higher adherence in terms of proportion of days covered (adjusted difference 0.06, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.08). Medical costs were similar, but the cost of Basaglar was lower (adjusted mean cost difference -$462, 95% CI -$556 to -$363) after adjustment.

Conclusions

In patients with type 2 diabetes, Basaglar provided similar glycaemic control compared with Lantus, had a similar safety profile and lower drug costs, and showed more favourable adherence.

Characteristics of Patients Unable to Achieve Target HbA 1c Stratified by Endpoint FPG

Further analysis of patients unable to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0% was conducted according to whether or not they were able to achieve an FPG of ≤ 6.1 mmol/L (Table 4). The majority of patients unable to achieve target HbA 1c also failed to reach an FPG of ≤ 6.1 mmol/L (74.5% vs 25.5%). Patients with an endpoint FPG of ≤ 6.1 mmol/L had significantly lower endpoint HbA 1c (7.60 ± 0.88% vs 7.90 ± 0.89%; P < 0.0001), baseline FPG (8.01 ± 1.82 vs 8.97 ± 2.25 mmol/L; P < 0.0001), endpoint FPG (5.46 ± 0.57 vs 8.01 ± 2.32 mmol/L; P < 0.0001), baseline 2-h PPG (11.67 ± 3.09 vs 12.81 ± 3.86 mmol/L; P < 0.0001), endpoint 2-h PPG (9.24 ± 2.66 vs 10.89 ± 2.68 mmol/L; P < 0.0001), BMI (24.12 ± 3.04 vs 25.76 ± 3.67 kg/m 2; P < 0.0001), dose of endpoint insulin glargine in U/day (16.42 ± 6.15 vs 18.39 ± 6.62 U/day; P = 0.0002), and baseline dose of premixed insulin in U/day (29.78 ± 9.28 vs 32.33 ± 11.55 U/day; P = 0.0013) than patients with an endpoint FPG of > 6.1 mmol/L. Other characteristics such as age, baseline HbA 1c, duration of diabetes, dose of endpoint insulin glargine in U/kg/day, and baseline dose of premixed insulin in U/kg/day were similar between both groups.

This study also demonstrates that BMI could be a factor influencing efficacy outcomes. Patients with endpoint HbA 1c < 7.0% were shown to have lower baseline BMI than patients with endpoint HbA 1c ≥ 7.0%. Higher BMI has been shown to be associated with decreased insulin sensitivity, which may be why patients with lower BMI exhibit greater glycemic control in response to insulin glargine.

Another factor of significance was the insulin glargine dose at endpoint, which was shown to be negatively associated with achieving HbA 1c < 7.0%. This may have been on account of the suboptimal glycemic control of patients at baseline. At baseline, the mean HbA 1c of the mITT set was 7.8% and the mean FPG was 8.1 mmol/L.

Findings from this study demonstrate that FPG is an important factor influencing the HbA 1c level of patients. Patients with an improvement in HbA 1c had significantly higher baseline HbA 1c in comparison to the unchanged and deterioration groups. This reflects a more marked reduction in HbA 1c for poorly controlled patients, although this does not necessarily indicate their achievement of HbA 1c < 7.0%. Fasting hyperglycemia is the main contributor to glycemic load for poorly controlled T2DM and this suggests that for patients with poor glycemic control at baseline, treatment with insulin glargine, which targets FPG, has a greater impact on overall glycemic control. This has also been observed in the study by Zhang et al. Patients with higher baseline HbA 1c levels, as a result of the nature of their hyperglycemia, are therefore likely to experience improvements in glycemic control in comparison to those with lower baseline HbA 1c levels during treatment switching.

Characteristics of Patients with Improved, Unchanged, or Deteriorated Levels of HbA 1c

Patients in the mITT population were also stratified according to whether their HbA 1c levels improved, unchanged, or deteriorated at the end of the study. The numbers of patients in the improved, unchanged, and deteriorated groups were 1168 (63.2%), 412 (22.3%), and 267 (14.5%) patients, respectively. Characteristics of patients in the different HbA 1c groups are shown in Table 3. Baseline HbA 1c was lowest in the unchanged group (6.90 ± 0.91%) and highest in the improvement group (8.25 ± 1.04%; P < 0.001). There was a trend toward older age at baseline when moving from the HbA 1c improvement (55.50 ± 11.14 years) to deterioration group (58.10 ± 10.53 years), although this difference was not statistically significant. BMI levels were similar across all three groups (P = 0.054). The number of patients with a mean duration of diabetes ≤ 5 years, 5–10 years, and > 10 years differed significantly between all three groups (P < 0.001). The number of patients with mean duration of diabetes ≤ 5 years was the highest for the improvement group compared with the unchanged and deterioration groups (507 vs 192 vs 81, respectively).

Severe Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including BASAGLAR. The rates of reported hypoglycemia depend on the definition of hypoglycemia used, diabetes type, insulin dose, intensity of glucose control, background therapies, and other intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors. For these reasons, comparing rates of hypoglycemia in clinical trials for BASAGLAR with the incidence of hypoglycemia for other products may be misleading and also, may not be representative of hypoglycemia rates that will occur in clinical practice.

Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose below 50 mg/dL (≤ 56 mg/dL in the 5-year trial and ≤ 36 mg/dL in the ORIGIN trial) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose or glucagon administration.

The incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in patients receiving BASAGLAR with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Studies (14)] was 4% at 52 weeks and 1% at 24 weeks, respectively.

The incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in a clinical trial with another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, in children and adolescents age 6 to 15 years with type 1 diabetes [see Clinical Studies (14)] was 23% at 26 weeks.

Table 5 displays the proportion of patients experiencing severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, and Standard Care groups in the ORIGIN Trial [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Allergic Reactions

Some patients taking insulins, including BASAGLAR have experienced erythema, local edema, and pruritus at the site of injection. These conditions were usually self-limiting. Severe cases of generalized allergy (anaphylaxis) have been reported.

Peripheral Edema

Some patients taking BASAGLAR have experienced sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy.

Lipodystrophy

Administration of insulins subcutaneously, including BASAGLAR, has resulted in lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue) in some patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Weight gain

Weight gain has occurred with insulins, including BASAGLAR, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glycosuria.

Methods

Study Design

We conducted a retrospective analysis of pharmacy claims in the MarketScan commercial claims data, spanning November 2020 to November 2022 (eMethods in Supplement 1). Institutional review board approval was waived because we analyzed deidentified patient-level data that were fully compliant with HIPAA (US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act). We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines for reporting observational studies.

The study population included commercially insured enrollees who were younger than 65 years and had at least 1 fill for a highly prescribed long-acting insulin glargine (Lantus [Sanofi]) or its substitutes, interchangeable biosimilar insulin glargine-yfgn (Semglee [Mylan Pharmaceuticals]) and a noninterchangeable insulin glargine (Basaglar [Lilly]) (eTable 1 in Supplement 1), in the 12-month period before and after November 16, 2021, when interchangeable insulin glargine-yfgn was launched (insulin glargine-yfgn was initially launched as a noninterchangeable biosimilar in June 2020). We included the noninterchangeable substitute, which was approved as a follow-on biologic to the highly prescribed insulin glargine, because it is widely considered a biosimilar in clinical practice. We excluded Toujeo (Sanofi; another branded insulin glargine) from the denominator because our focus was on understanding the extent to which state laws may influence the substitution of the highly prescribed insulin glargine with insulin glargine-yfgn (the other branded insulin glargine cannot be substituted with insulin glargine-yfgn).

Statistical Analysis

A modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis was used for reporting patient characteristics and demographics at baseline and study endpoint. The subgroup analyses were conducted using different efficacy variables: HbA 1c level at endpoint, change in HbA 1c from baseline, and FPG level at endpoint. Data were summarized using mean and standard deviation for continuous parameters, and counts plus percentages for categorical parameters. The t test was used for comparison between subgroups. In addition, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Chi-squared test were used for continuous and dichotomous variables, respectively. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the factors associated with achieving HbA 1c < 7.0%. The following variables were included in the analyses: baseline and endpoint HbA 1c (%); baseline and endpoint FPG (mmol/L); duration of diabetes at baseline (years); premixed insulin dose prior to study entry (U/kg and U/kg/day); age at baseline (years); body mass index (BMI) at baseline (kg/m 2); gender; dose of insulin glargine at study end (U/kg and U/kg/day); number of OADs at baseline; baseline and endpoint 2-h PPG; diabetic complications at baseline; comorbidities at baseline; hypoglycemia. A P value less than 0.05 (two-sided tests) was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were carried out using the SAS 9.1.3 software package (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

Information on the patients, study design, intervention, data collection, clinical assessment, and statistical analysis of the Lantus Registry Study have been reported previously.

Data Collection

At baseline (week 1), patient demographic data were obtained together with the disease history and details of diabetes treatment prior to participation in the study. Visits subsequently took place at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 16. Physical examinations were carried out at all visits, and FPG, 2-h postprandial glucose (PPG), safety data, and details of current treatment were recorded. For 2-h PPG, at least the latest recording from the laboratory test or self-monitoring was collected at each visit. However, patients could provide further recordings to assist the treating physician's decision. HbA 1c measurements were collected at weeks 1 and 16. Hypoglycemic events were also recorded, and were defined as all events in which patients showed symptoms of hypoglycemia for which their symptoms could be relieved by ingestion of carbohydrates or their symptoms occurred when blood glucose was ≤ 3.9 mmol/L. The number of patients who had experienced at least one hypoglycemic event since their last visit was recorded from visit 2 (week 2) to visit 5 (week 16).

Data Assessment

The primary endpoint of the Lantus Registry Study was change in HbA 1c from baseline to week 16. Secondary endpoints included FPG, 2-h PPG, and body weight changes from baseline to week 16, as well as treatment satisfaction score changes from baseline to week 16 based on the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire status version. The current subgroup analyses were performed to assess the characteristics of patients who successfully achieved or sustained HbA 1c < 7.0% (target HbA 1c). This was evaluated by comparing characteristics of patients who did and did not achieve HbA 1c < 7.0%, as well as by conducting logistic regression analysis. Characteristics of patients who showed improvement, deterioration, or no change in glycemic control following the transition from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus OADs were also assessed. Improvement of glycemic control was defined as a reduction in HbA 1c of ≥ 0.3%. Unchanged glycemic control was defined as a –0.3% to +0.3% change in HbA 1c, and deterioration of HbA 1c was defined as an increase in HbA 1c of ≥ 0.3%. Characteristics of patients who were unable to reach HbA 1c < 7.0% were further analyzed by stratifying these patients into subgroups based on their FPG at endpoint (> 6.1 or ≤ 6.1 mmol/L) and comparing these subgroups.

### Considerations for insulin-treated type 2 diabetes patients during hospitalization: a narrative review of what we need to know in the age of second-generation basal insulin analogs [^1165UhdK]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Challenges of Interrupting Treatment with Second-generation Basal Insulin Analogs during Hospitalization

Not all hospital formularies include second-generation basal insulins, so patients may need to be transferred to the available formulary basal insulin, and, in some cases, it might be more practical or desirable to transfer patients temporarily to continuous intravenous (IV) insulin infusion. The current lack of data and restricted formularies will mean that the vast majority of patients being treated with degludec or glargine U300 are likely to be switched to an insulin with a shorter half-life. Despite this, there are no guidelines on safely switching between second- and first-generation basal insulin analogs upon admittance and discharge from hospital. While the prescribing information gives recommendations on how to switch to these newer insulins (unit-for-unit conversions except when switching from twice-daily basal insulin to glargine U300, where a 20% dose reduction is recommended), it is unknown whether these are suitable for patients who may have just undergone major changes in glucose handling before being discharged from hospital, and there is even less information on switching from these insulins. Table 3 presents a comparison of guidance (drawn from the authors' clinical experience) on the hospital care of patients with T2D receiving outpatient basal insulin regimens involving a first- or second-generation basal insulin analog.

### Which patients will benefit from a switch in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus oral antidiabetic drugs? Further analysis of the lantus registry study [^114DHGDM]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Patient characteristics influencing treatment outcomes identified in this study were baseline duration of diabetes, HbA 1c, FPG, and age. Logistic regression analysis revealed that baseline duration of diabetes, HbA 1c, FPG, and age were negatively associated with achieving target HbA 1c levels of < 7.0%. This was reflected in patients with endpoint HbA 1c < 7.0% having a shorter mean duration of diabetes, lower HbA 1c and FPG, and younger age at baseline than patients with endpoint HbA 1c ≥ 7.0%. Additionally, a higher proportion of patients with mean duration of diabetes ≤ 5 years were found in the HbA 1c improvement group compared with the unchanged and deterioration groups. The mean age from the HbA 1c improvement to deterioration groups also increased numerically.

The above results suggest that switching treatment to insulin glargine plus OADs in patients earlier, while they are younger, with a shorter duration of diabetes and with lower levels of HbA 1c and FPG, can provide them with a better chance of achieving target glycemic control. Given that islet beta cell function has been shown to progressively deteriorate over time in patients with T2DM, an early transition in treatment for patients inadequately controlled on premixed insulin is more desirable. The above results have also been observed in two real-world Chinese studies which, similar to this study, have evaluated patient characteristics that aid in identifying patients who can benefit the most from a switch in treatment from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus OADs. One of the studies by Zhang et al. demonstrated, through comparison of patient groups who did and did not reach HbA 1c targets (HbA 1c ≤ 6.5%, 6.5% < HbA 1c < 7.0%, or HbA 1c > 7.0%) by the study end, that duration of diabetes and baseline HbA 1c were two factors closely associated with the success of the treatment transition. The other study by Yang et al. also demonstrated, through logistic regression analysis, that the probability of achieving a HbA 1c target of < 7.0% is lower with increased disease duration (odds ratio [OR] = 0.785) and higher baseline HbA 1c (OR = 0.482). The study by Yang et al. also demonstrated that patients with endpoint HbA 1c < 7.0% were younger than patients with HbA 1c ≥ 7.0% (54.67 ± 7.99 vs 57.42 ± 8.42 years; P = 0.0265). Studies have shown that there is impaired beta cell function and tissue sensitivity to insulin with aging, which may be why younger patients are able to better respond to the switch in treatment, and therefore reach glycemic targets or demonstrate an improvement in HbA 1c, in comparison to those who are older.

### Estimated changes in insulin prices and discounts after entry of new insulin products, 2012–2019 [^114y6yXu]. JAMA Health Forum (2023). High credibility.

Researchers and policy makers have expressed concern that pharmacy benefit manager rebates by branded products may result in insurers' preferring higher net-priced products with a rebate over lower net-priced products. Our data suggest that manufacturers are competing on net price but that a larger rebate may be a competitive advantage among similarly net-priced products. For instance, the net price of Lantus was lowered to match that of Basaglar even though Basaglar captured only 11% of market share. Insurer preference for Lantus may be due, in part, to its nearly 50% greater rebate. In the human insulin market, Humulin gained market share (eFigure 3 in Supplement 1) even though Novolin decreased its net price to be slightly lower than that of Humulin. Humulin uptake may reflect its larger rebates.

Across the 3 classes, even in the periods before new competition, net price growth was lower than others have estimated for branded pharmaceuticals overall, which suggests that pharmacy benefit managers have been effective in using formularies to reduce price growth even in duopoly markets. Pharmacy benefit managers also appear to have used new-brand competition to reduce net price growth before the introduction of interchangeable biosimilar products, as observed in the 2015 net price reductions among long-acting insulin analogues.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of subcutaneous injections of LANTUS
have been established in pediatric patients (age 6 to 15 years) with type 1
diabetes [see Clinical Studies
(14)]. LANTUS has not been studied in pediatric patients younger than
6 years of age with type 1 diabetes. LANTUS has not been studied in pediatric
patients with type 2 diabetes.

Based on the results of a study in pediatric patients, the dose
recommendation when switching to LANTUS is the same as that described for adults [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Studies (14)]. As in adults, the dosage of LANTUS must be individualized in pediatric
patients based on metabolic needs and frequent monitoring of blood glucose.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In controlled clinical studies comparing LANTUS to NPH insulin,
593 of 3890 patients (15%) with type 1 and type 2 diabetes were ≥ 65 years of age
and 80 (2%) patients were ≥ 75 years of age. The only difference in safety or
effectiveness in the subpopulation of patients ≥ 65 years of age compared to the
entire study population was a higher incidence of cardiovascular events
typically seen in an older population in both LANTUS and NPH insulin-treated
patients.

Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when LANTUS is administered to
geriatric patients. In elderly patients with diabetes, the initial dosing, dose
increments, and maintenance dosage should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic
reactions. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

5.6 Hepatic impairment

Due to its long duration of action, Lantus is not recommended
during periods of rapidly declining hepatic function because of the risk for
prolonged hypoglycemia.

Although studies have not been performed in patients with diabetes and
hepatic impairment, a reduction in the LANTUS dose may be required in patients
with hepatic impairment because of reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and
reduced insulin metabolism, similar to observations found with other insulins. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Insulin glargin (Lantus) [^113VxFRc]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

2.1 Dosing

LANTUS is a recombinant human insulin analog for once daily
subcutaneous administration with potency that is approximately the same as the
potency of human insulin. LANTUS exhibits a relatively constant glucose-lowering
profile over 24 hours that permits once-daily dosing.

LANTUS may be administered at any time during the day. LANTUS should be
administered subcutaneously once a day at the same time every day. The dose of
LANTUS must be individualized based on clinical response. Blood glucose
monitoring is essential in all patients receiving insulin therapy.

Patients adjusting the amount or timing of dosing with LANTUS, should only do
so under medical supervision with appropriate glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) .]

In patients with type 1 diabetes, LANTUS must be used in regimens with
short-acting insulin.

The intended duration of activity of LANTUS is dependent on injection into
subcutaneous tissue [see Clinical
pharmacology (12.2)]. LANTUS should not be administered intravenously
or via an insulin pump. Intravenous administration of the usual subcutaneous
dose could result in severe hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

As with all insulins, injection sites should be rotated within the same
region (abdomen, thigh, or deltoid) from one injection to the next to reduce the
risk of lipodystrophy [See Adverse Reactions
(6.1)].

In clinical studies, there was no clinically relevant difference in insulin
glargine absorption after abdominal, deltoid, or thigh subcutaneous
administration. As for all insulins, the rate of absorption, and consequently
the onset and duration of action, may be affected by exercise and other
variables, such as stress, intercurrent illness, or changes in co-administered
drugs or meal patterns.

2.2 Initiation of LANTUS therapy

The recommended starting dose of LANTUS in patients with type 1
diabetes should be approximately one-third of the total daily insulin
requirements. Short-acting, premeal insulin should be used to satisfy the
remainder of the daily insulin requirements.

The recommended starting dose of LANTUS in patients with type 2 diabetes who
are not currently treated with insulin is 10 units (or 0.2 Units/kg) once daily,
which should subsequently be adjusted to the patient's needs.

The dose of LANTUS should be adjusted according to blood glucose
measurements. The dosage of LANTUS should be individualized under the
supervision of a healthcare provider in accordance with the needs of the
patient.

### Insulin glargine (Lantus) [^112DJbMK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12	CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In clinical studies, the glucose-lowering effect on a molar basis (i.e., when given at the same doses) of intravenous LANTUS is approximately the same as that for human insulin. Figure 1 shows results from a study in patients with type 1 diabetes conducted for a maximum of 24 hours after subcutaneous injection of LANTUS or NPH insulin. The median time between subcutaneous injection and the end of pharmacological effect was 14.5 hours (range: 9.5 to 19.3 hours) for NPH insulin, and 24 hours (range: 10.8 to > 24 hours) (24 hours was the end of the observation period) for LANTUS.

The duration of action after abdominal, deltoid, or thigh subcutaneous administration of LANTUS was similar. The time course of action of insulins, including LANTUS, may vary between patients and within the same patient.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

After subcutaneous injection of LANTUS in healthy subjects and in patients with diabetes, the insulin serum concentrations indicated a slower, more prolonged absorption and a relatively constant concentration/time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced peak in comparison to NPH insulin.

Elimination

Metabolism

A metabolism study in humans indicates that insulin glargine is partly metabolized at the carboxyl terminus of the B chain in the subcutaneous depot to form two active metabolites with in vitro activity similar to that of human insulin, M1 (21A-Gly-insulin) and M2 (21A-Gly-des-30B-Thr-insulin). Unchanged drug and these degradation products are also present in the circulation.

Specific Populations

Age, Race, Body Mass Index, and Gender

Effect of age, race, body mass index (BMI), and gender on the pharmacokinetics of insulin glargine has not been evaluated. However, in controlled clinical studies in adults (n = 3,890) and a controlled clinical study in pediatric patients (n = 349), subgroup analyses based on age, race, BMI, and gender did not show differences in safety and efficacy between LANTUS and NPH insulin [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Introduction

This subgroup analysis of data from the 16-week Lantus Registry Study in China investigated the characteristics of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) associated with clinical benefits of transitioning therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine (100 U/ml) plus oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs).

Methods

The modified intention-to-treat population of the Lantus Registry Study, comprising 1847 patients with T2DM, were included in the current subgroup analyses. Enrolled patients were divided into subgroups based on efficacy variables of endpoint glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c), endpoint fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and change in HbA 1c from baseline. The baseline characteristics of those who did and did not achieve HbA 1c < 7.0% were compared, as were those with improvement, no change, or deterioration in HbA 1c. Characteristics of patients who were unable to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0%, further grouped according to whether or not they achieved FPG ≤ 6.1 mmol/L, were also compared. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with achieving HbA 1c < 7.0%.

Comparison between subgroups demonstrated that patients with endpoint HbA 1c < 7.0% were significantly younger, with a shorter duration of diabetes and lower baseline FPG, HbA 1c, body mass index, and dose of premixed insulin than patients with endpoint HbA 1c ≥ 7.0%. Logistic regression analysis revealed a negative correlation between baseline age, HbA 1c, FPG, and duration of diabetes with achieving HbA 1c < 7.0%. When stratified according to change in HbA 1c, the improvement group was younger, with higher baseline HbA 1c and a greater number of patients with duration of diabetes ≤ 5 years. Three-quarters of patients unable to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0% also failed to reach FPG ≤ 6.1 mmol/L.

Conclusion

Younger patients with a shorter duration of diabetes and lower HbA 1c, FPG, and premixed insulin dose following a switch in treatment to insulin glargine (100 U/ml) plus OADs from premixed insulin have greater potential to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0%. Poorly controlled patients with higher baseline HbA 1c are most likely to experience an improvement in HbA 1c following the switch in therapy. The majority of patients unable to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0% also failed to reach FPG ≤ 6.1 mmol/L, highlighting the importance of adequate titration of insulin glargine to achieve adequate FPG control, which can enable achievement of target HbA 1c.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Study and participant selection

Participant‐level data were collected and pooled for analysis from RCTs of up to 24 weeks, conducted by Sanofi, the manufacturer of Gla‐100 (Lantus, Paris, France) between 2000 and 2015. To fulfil the inclusion criteria for this analysis, all trials were required to enrol insulin‐naïve individuals whose T2DM was inadequately controlled (HbA1c > 7.0%; > 53 mmol/mol) while using OADs, with at least one study arm commencing once‐daily Gla‐100, and no other basal insulin, and using a titration algorithm, predominantly a once‐weekly dose adjustment of 2‐8 U/d, based on the patient's self‐measured plasma glucose (SMPG) to achieve an FPG of ≤ 5.6 mmol/L (≤ 100 mg/dL). Sixteen studies that met the inclusion criteria were identified and have been described elsewhere. 9 All study participants (N = 3415) for whom data were analysed were mainly receiving one (metformin or sulfonylurea) or two OADs (metformin with a sulfonylurea); a few participants received other OADs alone or in combination (eg, gliptin, thiazolidinedione or glinide) with Gla‐100 (Figure S1).

### Risk of clinically relevant hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes self-titrating insulin glargine U-100 [^1171AWsj]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Titration algorithms, which have been shown to be effective while maintaining a reasonable risk of hypoglycaemia, provide useful guidance to HCPs in titrating basal insulin. 3, 7 Patient‐driven self‐titration algorithms may be used as an alternative to titration led by HCPs. 8 Clinical trials comparing patient‐driven and physician‐driven basal insulin titration have provided reassuring results, showing similar or better glycaemic control with patient‐driven methods. 9 However, HCPs may feel uncomfortable advising patients to implement self‐titration because of concerns about hypoglycaemia. Further research is needed to understand the factors that will identify patients who might require more cautious self‐titration monitoring and more frequent supervision because of the risk of hypoglycaemia.

We have undertaken a reanalysis of hypoglycaemia in two RCTs that involved glargine self‐titration, using the definition of clinically relevant hypoglycaemia (blood glucose < 3 mmol/L [54 mg/dL]), which is in line with recent recommendations that glucose concentrations less than 3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) should be reported in clinical trials. 10 The ELEMENT‐2 and ELEMENT‐5 trials compared two IGlar U‐100 products, Lantus and LY2963016, in patients with T2D. 11, 12 LY2963016 is an insulin glargine product developed by Eli Lilly and Company and Boehringer Ingelheim which is considered a follow‐on biologic to Lantus in the United States and a biosimilar product in the EU and some other countries. Treatment comprised a 3‐month titration period, during which doses were frequently adjusted based on self‐monitored blood glucose, and a 3‐month maintenance period.

This study sought to provide additional insight into the burden of hypoglycaemia in patients with T2D who were self‐titrating IGlar 100 U/mL by determining if glycaemic control, older age or previous insulin treatment affected the risk of clinically relevant hypoglycaemia (blood glucose < 3 mmol/L) during IGlar self‐titration.

6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Two clinical trials with BASAGLAR were conducted: one in type 1 diabetes and one in type 2 diabetes.

The type 1 diabetes population had the following characteristics: Mean age was 41 years and mean duration of diabetes was 16 years. 58% were male. 75% were Caucasian, 2% Black or African American and 4% American Indian or Alaskan native. 4% were Hispanic. At baseline, mean eGFR was 109 mL/min/1.73m2. 73.5 percent of patients had eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73m2. The mean BMI was approximately 26 kg/m2. HbA1cat baseline was 7.8%. The data in Table 1 reflect exposure of 268 patients to BASAGLAR with a mean exposure duration of 49 weeks.

The type 2 diabetes population had the following characteristics: Mean age was 59 years and mean duration of diabetes was 11 years. 50% were male. 78% were Caucasian, 8% Black or African American and 5% American Indian or Alaskan native. 28% were Hispanic. At baseline, mean eGFR was 109 mL/min/1.73m2. 67.5 percent of patients had eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73m2. The mean BMI was approximately 32 kg/m2. HbA1cat baseline was 8.3%. The data in Table 2 reflect exposure of 376 patients to BASAGLAR with a mean exposure duration of 22 weeks.

Common adverse reactions were defined as reactions occurring in ≥ 5% of the population studied. Common adverse reactions during clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus (other than hypoglycemia) are listed in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively.

The frequencies of adverse reactions during a clinical trial of 5 years duration with another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in Table 3.

The frequencies of adverse reactions during clinical trials with another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus are listed in Table 4.

### Insulin glargine in type 2 diabetes in everyday clinical practice: 7 years experience [^116gj4VF]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Insulin therapy is often essential in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) but is typically not initiated early enough or aggressive enough, leading to worsening of glycaemic control and the majority of people staying above recommended haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) targets of < 7%. The extensive clinical experience gained with insulin glargine, in particular, the low risk of hypoglycaemia and consistent improvements in HbA(1c), suggests that insulin glargine can be initiated aggressively to help patients reach such HbA(1c) targets. However, many clinicians may be unaware of how easy it is to initiate insulin glargine. Indeed, the once-daily injection of insulin glargine plus once-daily measurement of blood glucose should provide little difficulty for patients. In the current review, the options for the initiation of insulin glargine in T2DM and how the patient can become more involved in management of their diabetes are discussed. The advantages of insulin glargine in randomized controlled trials and how these have translated into everyday clinical practice are also discussed.

LANTUS Timing of Daily Dosing (see Table
11).

The safety and efficacy of LANTUS administered pre-breakfast, pre-dinner, or
at bedtime were evaluated in a randomized, controlled clinical study in patients
with type 1 diabetes (study H, n = 378). Patients were also treated with insulin
lispro at mealtime. LANTUS administered at different times of the day resulted
in similar reductions in HbA1c compared to that with bedtime administration (see Table 11). In these patients, data are available from
8-point home glucose monitoring. The maximum mean blood glucose was observed
just prior to injection of LANTUS regardless of time of administration.

In this study, 5% of patients in the LANTUS-breakfast arm discontinued
treatment because of lack of efficacy. No patients in the other two arms
discontinued for this reason. The safety and efficacy of LANTUS administered
pre-breakfast or at bedtime were also evaluated in a randomized,
active-controlled clinical study (Study I, n = 697) in patients with type 2
diabetes not adequately controlled on oral anti-diabetic therapy. All patients
in this study also received glimepiride 3 mg daily. LANTUS given before
breakfast was at least as effective in lowering HbA1c as LANTUS given at bedtime
or NPH insulin given at bedtime (see Table 11).

2.3	Starting Dose in Insulin-Naive Pediatric and Adult Patients

Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes

The recommended starting dose of Insulin Glargine, U-300 in insulin-naive patients with type 1 diabetes is approximately one-third to one-half of the total daily insulin dose. The remainder of the total daily insulin dose should be given as a short-acting insulin and divided between each daily meal. As a general rule, 0.2 to 0.4 units of insulin per kilogram of body weight can be used to calculate the initial total daily insulin dose in insulin-naive patients with type 1 diabetes.
The maximum glucose lowering effect of a dose of Insulin Glargine, U-300 may take five days to fully manifest and the first dose may be insufficient to cover metabolic needs in the first 24 hours of use [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. When initiating Insulin Glargine, U-300, monitor glucose daily.

Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

The recommended starting dose of Insulin Glargine, U-300 in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes is 0.2 units per kilogram of body weight once daily.

2.4	Starting Dose in Pediatric and Adult Patients with Either Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes Already on Insulin Therapy

Dosage adjustments are recommended to lower the risk of hypoglycemia when switching patients to Insulin Glargine, U-300 from another insulin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

For patients currently on once-daily long or intermediate-acting insulin, start Insulin Glargine, U-300 at the same unit dose as the once-daily long-acting insulin dose. For patients controlled on LANTUS (insulin glargine, 100 units/mL), expect that a higher daily dose of Insulin Glargine, U-300 will be needed to maintain the same level of glycemic control [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].
For patients currently on twice-daily long or intermediate-acting insulin, start Insulin Glargine, U-300 at 80% of the total daily NPH or insulin detemir twice-daily dosage.
When switching patients to Insulin Glargine, U-300, monitor glucose frequently in the first weeks of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption and Bioavailability. After subcutaneous injection of
insulin glargine in healthy subjects and in patients with diabetes, the insulin
serum concentrations indicated a slower, more prolonged absorption and a
relatively constant concentration/time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced
peak in comparison to NPH insulin. Serum insulin concentrations were thus
consistent with the time profile of the pharmacodynamic activity of insulin
glargine.

After subcutaneous injection of 0.3 Units/kg insulin glargine in patients
with type 1 diabetes, a relatively constant concentration/time profile has been
demonstrated. The duration of action after abdominal, deltoid, or thigh
subcutaneous administration was similar.

Metabolism. A metabolism study in humans indicates that insulin
glargine is partly metabolized at the carboxyl terminus of the B chain in the
subcutaneous depot to form two active metabolites with in vitro activity similar
to that of insulin, M1 (21A-Gly-insulin) and M2 (21A-Gly-des-30B-Thr-insulin). Unchanged
drug and these degradation products are also present in the circulation.

Special Populations

Age, Race, and Gender. Information on
the effect of age, race, and gender on the pharmacokinetics of LANTUS is not
available. However, in controlled clinical trials in adults (n = 3890) and a
controlled clinical trial in pediatric patients (n = 349), subgroup analyses based
on age, race, and gender did not show differences in safety and efficacy between
insulin glargine and NPH insulin [see Clinical Studies (14)].

4 DISCUSSION

In the current study, the primary objective was to compare the duration of action of LY IGlar and IGlar using a 42‐hour euglycaemic clamp procedure following a single SC administration of 0.3 U/kg in subjects with T1DM. The duration of action was similar for LY IGlar and IGlar, with a median duration of 37.1 and 40.0 hours and a mean duration of action of 23.8 and 25.5 hours, respectively. The mean values do not include clamps where the end of action was not reached by 42 hours and thus are underestimates of the actual duration of action. Based on the time‐to‐event analysis, it was demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference in the duration of action of LY IGlar compared to IGlar.

The efficacy and safety of LY IGlar was previously assessed in two randomized, controlled clinical trials in patients with T1DM and T2DM. 9, 10 These trials demonstrated equivalent efficacy of LY IGlar to IGlar, as measured by change in HbA1c from baseline. In addition, the insulin glargine products demonstrated similar safety profiles. The clinical safety and efficacy studies, 9, 10 in addition to the extensive manufacturing comparisons, 11 non‐clinical comparisons, 11 and prior PK/PD clinical pharmacology studies, 6 were all part of a comprehensive program that established the similarity of LY IGlar and IGlar. These studies were not conducted, however, with the intent to establish the interchangeability of LY IGlar and IGlar. Interchangeability requires a different scientific standard than biosimilarity, including a demonstration of safety for patients who are switched back and forth between the biosimilar and reference products. 12 The USA is unlike the EU and most other markets in that a decision regarding interchangeability is made by the US regulatory authority and can serve as a basis for a biosimilar to be substituted for the reference biological product at the pharmacy, and without advance notice or agreement of the prescriber. It remains to be seen whether pharmacy substitution of insulin products will be accepted by patients and providers, many of whom may be justifiably reluctant to permit substitution for a well‐controlled patient or to support any such switch without medical supervision. 12

Methods

Study Sample

In this longitudinal study, we categorized insulin products available from 2012 to 2019 into 3 groups: (1) long-acting insulin analogues, including insulin glargine (Lantus, Toujeo, and Basaglar), insulin detemir (Levemir), and insulin degludec (Tresiba); (2) short-acting insulin analogues, including insulin lispro (Humalog and Admelog) and insulin aspart (Novolog and Fiasp); and (3) human insulin products, including Novolin and Humulin. Insulin products were categorized at the product level instead of the national drug code level because net sales data are reported only at the brand-name level. Therefore, we did not separately categorize formulations of a product (eg, Humulin N vs Humulin Mix).

Data Sources

We used 5 data sources: (1) net sales and total units from SSR Health; (2) Medicare Part B and Part D 5% claims; (3) Medicare Part D prescriber use files; (4) Medicare and Medicaid spending dashboards; and (5) the 340B covered entity database. The institutional review board at the University of California, San Diego deemed this study exempt from the need for informed consent because only deidentified data were used in analyses. Data analyses were performed from June 1, 2022, to October 31, 2022. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

### Duration of action of two insulin glargine products, LY2963016 insulin glargine and lantus insulin glargine, in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus [^115AmEL5]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Because the previous LY IGlar PK/PD studies designed to meet bioequivalence criteria were conducted in healthy subjects, it has not been possible to compare the PD duration of action of LY IGlar and that of IGlar because of the presence of endogenous insulin. A higher dose of 0.5 U/kg and a clamp duration limited to 24 hours also contributed to preventing determination of the duration of action.

Regulatory guidelines recommend clamp durations of at least 24 hours for determining the duration of action of intermediate or long‐acting insulins. 3 A clamp duration of 42 hours was used in the present study in an effort to allow a higher percentage of subjects to reach the end of action compared to shorter clamp durations. To our knowledge, this is the first euglycaemic clamp study reporting the duration of action for an insulin glargine using a clamp duration as long as 42 hours; although a clamp duration of 42 hours was also used in a study comparing IGlar and insulin degludec in subjects with T1DM, only data to 24 hours was reported. 13 While extending clamp duration further would allow for more subjects to reach end of action and potentially eliminate the need for right‐censoring, practical considerations and safety concerns related to the length of fasting and the relatively high blood loss make it problematic to extend glucose clamps beyond 42 hours.

### State substitution laws and uptake of an interchangeable insulin biosimilar [^116wZfe5]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Although biosimilars have potential to reduce drug spending, their use remains low. Automatic substitutions of biologic drugs by their biosimilars at pharmacies can facilitate biosimilar uptake. Yet, state regulations limiting the types and circumstances under which biosimilars may be substituted could discourage efficient biosimilar adoption.

Objective

To examine associations of state substitution laws in the US with biosimilar adoption in the insulin glargine market, in which an interchangeable biosimilar was recently launched.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study using MarketScan commercial claims data examined fills for insulin glargine among users who were younger than 65 years and had fills for the insulin glargine Lantus (Sanofi) and its biosimilars, interchangeable insulin glargine-yfgn (Semglee [Mylan Pharmaceuticals]) and a noninterchangeable insulin glargine (Basaglar [Lilly]). Data were analyzed from August 2024 to January 2025.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Market share of the insulin glargine, interchangeable insulin glargine-yfgn, and the noninterchangeable insulin glargine. Unit of analysis was the per-person prescription fill. Changes in fills between those residing in states with less vs more restrictive substitution laws in a 1-year period before and after the launch of interchangeable glargine-yfgn (November 16, 2021) were compared.

Results

A total of 487 281 per-person prescription fills (mean [SD] age, 49.5 [13.3] years; 56.9% male) were included, with 158 141 and 329 140 per-person prescription fills from less vs more restrictive states, respectively. Following the launch of insulin glargine-yfgn, its market share differentially increased by 7.03 percentage points (pp; 95% CI, 1.89–12.18 pp; p = 0.008), coinciding with a 6.48 pp (95% CI, -11.70 to -1.26 pp; p = 0.02) differential reduction in the insulin glargine market share in states with less vs more restrictive laws. In the last quarter, the market share for insulin glargine-yfgn was 20.6% and 12.1% in states with less and more restrictive laws, respectively. There were not statistically significant differential changes in fills for the noninterchangeable insulin glargine (-0.24 pp; 95% CI, -1.40 to 0.92 pp; p = 0.68). Three restrictions had more pronounced associations with a lower uptake of insulin glargine-yfgn: enhanced physician notification (-8.15 pp; 95% CI, -12.49 to -3.81 pp; P < .001), refill notifications (-4.68 pp; 95% CI, -8.78 to -0.58 pp; p = 0.03), and patient notification (-3.52 pp; 95% CI, -8.44 to 1.40 pp; p = 0.16).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, insulin users in states with less restrictive substitution laws were more likely to fill the biosimilar alternative to insulin glargine, underscoring the role of state regulations of substitution as an important determinant of biosimilar adoption and the need for reforms to increase efficient biosimilar adoption.

14.3	Clinical Studies in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

In a 26-week open-label, controlled study (Study C, n = 804), adults with type 2 diabetes were randomized to once-daily treatment in the evening with either Insulin Glargine, U-300 or LANTUS. Short-acting mealtime insulin analogues with or without metformin were also administered. The average age was 60 years. The majority of patients were White (92%) and 53% were male; 20% of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean BMI was approximately 36.6 kg/m2. At week 26, treatment with Insulin Glargine, U-300 provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.4% compared to LANTUS (Table 6). Patients treated with Insulin Glargine, U-300 used 11% more basal insulin than patients treated with LANTUS. There were no clinically important differences in body weight between treatment groups.

In two open-label, controlled studies (n = 1670), adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to either Insulin Glargine, U-300 or LANTUS once daily for 26 weeks as part of a regimen of combination therapy with noninsulin antidiabetic drugs. At the time of randomization, 808 patients were treated with basal insulin for more than 6 months (Study D) and 862 patients were insulin-naive (Study E).

Insulin glargine (Lantus, Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Bridgewater, NJ) is a long-acting once-daily dosed form of insulin intended to maintain a constant baseline insulin level. As a relatively new medication, there is limited experience in overdoses of Lantus. We present a case of a 37-year-old male insulin-dependent diabetic presenting with refractory hypoglycemia secondary to an intentional overdose of Lantus insulin to illustrate the varied management concerns in overdoses of long-acting insulins. The patient was managed with oral intake, intravenous dextrose bolus, peripheral 10% dextrose solution, 25% dextrose sliding scale via central line, and psychiatry evaluation for suicide attempt. Other potential treatments discussed for possible use with long-acting insulin overdoses include incision and drainage of the injection site, glucagon, and octreotide.

Results

Patient Disposition and Baseline Characteristics

The Lantus Registry Study was conducted between September 28, 2010 and June 18, 2012 at 53 hospitals across China. The mITT population comprised 1847 patients, who were included in the following subgroup analyses. The mean duration of diabetes of the mITT population was 8.4 years, mean HbA 1c was 7.8%, and mean FPG was 8.1 mmol/L. At study entry, 28.6% of patients had an HbA 1c level < 7.0%. Details of the baseline characteristics of the mITT population have been reported previously.

OAD Treatment Before and After the Switch

The types and number of OADs used before and after the switch have also been described previously. The overall pattern of OAD usage was similar before and after the switch. Before the switch, the most common regimen was premixed insulin plus one OAD (41.4%), followed by no OAD (40.4%), two OADs (15.9%) and more than two OADs (2.2%). Overall, the most common OADs used were biguanides (35.5%), followed by α-glucosidase inhibitors (26.2%), glinides (6.7%), sulfonylureas (6.0%), thiazolidinediones (TZDs) (4.8%), and others (0.9%).

After the switch, the types and number of OADs used in combination with insulin glargine demonstrated a trend of being stable after 8 weeks' treatment. One OAD in combination with insulin glargine was used by more than 45.0% of the patients at all visits after the switch and remained the most common regimen, followed by insulin glargine plus two types of OADs. Biguanides remained the most common OAD used after the switch (over 48.0% at all visits), followed by α-glucosidase inhibitors, glinides, sulfonylureas, TZDs, and others.

Safety Outcomes Trial

No clinical studies to establish the cardiovascular safety of Insulin Glargine, U-300 have been conducted. A cardiovascular outcomes trial, ORIGIN, has been conducted with LANTUS. It is unknown whether the results of ORIGIN can be applied to Insulin Glargine, U-300.

The Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention trial (i.e. ORIGIN) was an open-label, randomized, 12,537 patient study that compared LANTUS to standard care on the time to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE). MACE was defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The incidence of MACE was similar between LANTUS and standard care in ORIGIN (Hazard Ratio [95% CI] for MACE; 1.02 [0.94, 1.11]).

In the ORIGIN trial, the overall incidence of cancer (all types combined) (Hazard Ratio [95% CI]; 0.99 [0.88, 1.11]) or death from cancer (Hazard Ratio [95% CI]; 0.94 [0.77, 1.15]) was also similar between treatment groups.

Product-Specific Trends

The list price ($24.65) of the new product Toujeo, introduced in 2015, closely matched the 2016 list price ($24.71) of the originator Lantus; however, its net price was slightly lower ($12.92 for Toujeo vs $14.56 for Lantus) (Figure 1). The list and net prices of Tresiba were higher than the list and net prices of Lantus and insulin detemir throughout the study period. Basaglar, the product that is bioequivalent to Lantus, had a lower list price than Lantus ($21.50 vs $24.87) in 2017. The net price of Basaglar ($10.92) was slightly lower than the net price of Lantus ($12.79) in 2017, but the net price of Lantus was reduced to match that of Basaglar by 2019 ($9.95 vs $9.99, respectively).

Trends in List Prices, Net Prices, and Discounts for Long-Acting Insulin Analogues

List prices were estimated as mean reimbursement rates in Medicare Part D per 100 insulin units. Net prices were estimated as the difference between list prices and commercial discounts and represent the prices faced by Part D and private plans after rebates. The insulin glargine Toujeo was approved in February 2015, insulin degludec (Tresiba) in September 2015, and the insulin glargine Basaglar in December 2015. As explained in the Methods, prices and discounts of new products are not reported for the first year after market entry (drugs approved in the first half of a calendar year) or 2 years after market entry (drugs approved in the second half of a calendar year) to mitigate how inventory variation may have affected the data, which is why data for Toujeo are first reported in 2016 and data for insulin degludec and Basaglar are first reported in 2017. Outcomes are expressed per 100 insulin units. The dashed line indicates approval for Toujeo, insulin degludec, and Basaglar.
