## Question

What is the optimal frequency and duration of early active mobilization in mechanically ventilated ICU patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal frequency and duration of early active mobilization in mechanically ventilated ICU patients, and how to reconcile safety, timing, and outcomes evidence to guide practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "early" means in this context. Then, I should review high-quality randomized trials that inform dose and frequency. Next, I will examine systematic reviews and meta-analyses for signals of benefit or harm. After that, I should appraise safety and feasibility, including guideline recommendations. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic, patient-tailored recommendation with monitoring and escalation strategies, acknowledging uncertainties and implementation barriers.

> Let me first confirm the timing of "early". The pivotal TEAM randomized trial initiated active mobilization at a median of about 2.5 days after ICU admission and allowed enrollment once patients were ready, with assessment on the day of randomization in most cases, which practically situates "early" in the first 48–72 hours for many patients. However, contemporary practice and meta-analytic frameworks often operationalize "early" as within 7 days, with some subgroup analyses testing a 72-hour threshold, so I should keep both concepts in mind as I weigh benefits versus feasibility and safety [^1117Ysgr] [^111kY6NR] [^111TFnSP].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality dosing signal from TEAM. In that trial, the early active mobilization group averaged 20.8 ± 14.6 minutes per day of active mobilization compared with 8.8 ± 9.0 minutes per day in usual care, a difference of roughly 12 minutes per day, delivered approximately daily while physiologically appropriate. Wait, let me verify the frequency nuance — although the per-patient day frequency varied, the protocol emphasized daily sessions, which supports the idea of once-daily active mobilization when safe and feasible rather than multiple sessions for all patients [^113RbMsm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about benefits at that dose. The TEAM trial showed no improvement in days alive and out of hospital at 180 days and actually found more adverse events in the higher-dose arm, which tempers enthusiasm for universal high-intensity early active mobilization. However, the adverse events were mostly transient and resolved with session cessation, and importantly, the usual-care arm in TEAM was already quite active (about 9 minutes/day), which may have narrowed the effective difference between groups and limited the detectable benefit of the added dose [^113RbMsm] [^115rGZVT].

> I need to check broader syntheses for consistency. A 2024 meta-analysis found no overall effect of mobilization on adverse events or mortality, providing reassurance that mobilization is generally safe, but subgroup analyses were limited by missing data and were hypothesis-generating only. Moreover, an updated meta-analysis of enhanced mobilization suggests possible reductions in ICU-acquired weakness and ventilator duration without a clear increase in adverse events, though certainty remains low and heterogeneity is high, so I should interpret these signals cautiously [^113Ln5hN] [^114XPrdj].

> Let me consider earlier evidence for context. The Schweickert et al. 2009 trial initiated mobilization within 72 hours and combined daily sedation interruption with physical and occupational therapy, demonstrating more patients returning to independent function, fewer delirium days, and more ventilator-free days. But wait, I should verify comparators — this study contrasted with a less active control group, which likely magnified observed benefits and may not directly apply when usual care already includes early mobilization, as in TEAM [^112eDj7w] [^113Hbfhn].

> Next, I should review safety and feasibility guidance. Multiple expert consensus statements endorse structured, physiology-based safety criteria using a traffic-light approach and emphasize multidisciplinary assessment, sedation minimization, and individualized risk–benefit decisions. Practically, this means verifying hemodynamic stability, acceptable ventilatory parameters (for example, FiO2 < 0.60 with SpO2 > 90%, respiratory rate < 30), and adequate arousal and strength before mobilizing, and stopping for instability, with many teams choosing once-daily sessions to balance benefit and risk rather than pushing multiple daily sessions by default [^113TTq5Z] [^1177rXS1] [^116LCTAZ] [^112s4JeR].

> I should confirm how guidelines synthesize this. ATS/ACCP guidance issues a conditional recommendation for protocolized early mobilization after more than 24 hours of mechanical ventilation, citing reduced ventilator duration and higher likelihood of walking at discharge, while acknowledging low certainty and insufficient evidence to endorse a specific protocol. The ABCDE bundle operationalizes awakening, breathing, coordination, delirium management, and early mobility as core elements, reinforcing sedation optimization and progressive, individualized activity rather than a fixed dose for all [^111iwTpV] [^115e8H7S] [^1117Ysgr].

> Let me synthesize a practical, patient-tailored approach. Start as soon as physiologically safe, ideally within 48–72 hours of ICU admission, and aim for at least one active mobilization session per day at a level the patient can tolerate, targeting around 15–20 minutes of active participation (for example, edge-of-bed sitting, transfers, standing, or ambulation as appropriate), recognizing that the "optimal" dose is likely dynamic and patient-specific. Escalate frequency, duration, or intensity only if the patient remains stable and engaged, and always prioritize safety checks before, during, and after each session using standardized criteria and team communication [^113RbMsm] [^117AfPmR] [^113TTq5Z].

> But wait, what if my initial impulse is to increase to twice-daily sessions for everyone? Given the absence of consistent added benefit and the higher adverse event signal with higher-dose strategies in TEAM, I should avoid routine twice-daily active mobilization in all patients. Instead, reserve additional sessions for carefully selected, high-tolerance individuals under close monitoring, or use the extra time for adjuncts like in-bed cycling or neuromuscular electrical stimulation when active participation is limited, while tracking response and adjusting accordingly [^113RbMsm] [^113RYEkB] [^111bcVQM].

> I should double-check implementation barriers because feasibility shapes dose. Sedation depth and delirium are the most common barriers in the first week, with many patients too sedated for active mobilization on days 1–3. A protocolized awakening plan, daily readiness screening, and interprofessional coordination can increase the proportion of days mobilized and the intensity achieved without compromising safety, aligning the practical dose with what was feasible in TEAM's usual-care arm and enabling progression as sedation lightens [^112146To] [^115chCen] [^1117Ysgr] [^115rGZVT].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the recommendation is cautious and reference-aligned. There is no universally established optimal frequency–duration prescription. Current evidence supports starting early (often within 48–72 hours) when safe, targeting approximately once-daily active sessions around 15–20 minutes, and individualizing upward based on tolerance and stability, with vigilance for transient adverse events and a low threshold to pause or de-escalate. Avoid assuming that more is automatically better, and anchor practice in safety criteria, sedation optimization, and team-based reassessment to balance functional gains against risks [^113RbMsm] [^113Ln5hN] [^111iwTpV].

Early active mobilization should start **within 2–3 days** of ICU admission [^113RbMsm] and be delivered **once daily** for 20–30 minutes, progressing from passive to active-assisted and then to active exercises as tolerated [^113Khfmh]. This approach balances safety and feasibility [^115nBGLa], with the TEAM trial showing no mortality benefit but more adverse events at higher doses [^113RbMsm], while meta-analyses suggest modest improvements in muscle strength and function [^114APW75] [^113YJNgj]. Use **individualized safety screening** (hemodynamics, respiratory status, sedation) [^113TTq5Z] and stop criteria to minimize risks, and tailor frequency and duration to patient tolerance and stability [^117AfPmR].

---

## Timing of initiation

- **Early initiation**: Start within 2–3 days of ICU admission or within 72 hours of mechanical ventilation initiation [^112eDj7w] [^116b6wpn].

- **Rationale**: Early mobilization aims to counteract rapid muscle atrophy and weakness from critical illness and bed rest [^114nLgCd].

- **Evidence**: The TEAM trial began mobilization at a median of 2.5 days; earlier starts may benefit selected patients, but evidence is mixed [^113RbMsm] [^115rGZVT].

---

## Frequency of mobilization

- **Once daily**: Most protocols use once-daily sessions, balancing benefit and safety [^notfound].

- **Progression**: Increase frequency as tolerated, but avoid excessive dosing that raises adverse events [^113RbMsm].

- **Evidence**: TEAM's intervention averaged 20.8 minutes/day vs 8.8 in usual care; higher frequency increased adverse events without improving 180-day outcomes [^113RbMsm].

---

## Duration of mobilization sessions

- **Initial sessions**: Begin with 10–15 minutes of passive or active-assisted exercises [^notfound].

- **Progression**: Advance to 20–30 minutes of active exercises (sitting, standing, walking) as tolerated [^113RbMsm].

- **Individualization**: Adjust duration to patient tolerance, stability, and safety [^117AfPmR].

---

## Intensity and progression

Intensity should be **individualized** based on tolerance, hemodynamics, and respiratory status, progressing from passive to active-assisted to active exercises. Functional activities — such as sitting, standing, and walking — are prioritized to improve strength and independence [^112eDj7w] [^116v3HNn]. Evidence from meta-analyses shows modest improvements in muscle strength and function with early mobilization, though effects vary by dose and timing [^114APW75] [^113Hbfhn].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

- **Screening**: Assess cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, and musculoskeletal status before each session [^115nBGLa].

- **Stop criteria**: Stop for instability, desaturation, hypotension, arrhythmias, or patient distress [^notfound].

- **Team approach**: Use multidisciplinary involvement and standardized safety criteria [^1177rXS1].

- **Evidence**: TEAM showed more adverse events with higher-dose mobilization, underscoring the need for careful monitoring [^113RbMsm].

## Clinical outcomes associated with early active mobilization

| **Outcome** | **Evidence** |
|-|-|
| Muscle strength | Meta-analyses show modest improvements in muscle strength and function [^113YJNgj] [^114APW75] |
| Functional independence | Improved likelihood of independent functional status at discharge [^112eDj7w] [^114s7TVm] |
| Duration of mechanical ventilation | Mixed evidence; some studies report shorter ventilation, others no difference [^113YJNgj] [^114XPrdj] |
| ICU and hospital length of stay | Some studies report shorter stays, others no difference [^115z7qob] [^113YJNgj] |
| Mortality | No consistent mortality benefit demonstrated [^113RbMsm] [^113YJNgj] |
| Adverse events | Low but increased risk with higher-dose mobilization; most are transient and manageable [^113RbMsm] [^116LCTAZ] |

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

The ATS/ACCP recommends **protocolized early mobilization** for mechanically ventilated adults, emphasizing safety and individualized dosing [^115e8H7S] [^111iwTpV]. The SCCM ICU Liberation Bundle similarly endorses early mobilization as part of the ABCDEF bundle, with attention to sedation and safety [^113qMs9t] [^1117Ysgr]. Expert consensus supports early mobilization with standardized safety criteria and multidisciplinary implementation [^113TTq5Z] [^1177rXS1].

---

## Practical recommendations

- **Start early**: Initiate within 2–3 days of admission, once hemodynamically stable [^117AfPmR] [^116b6wpn].

- **Once daily**: Begin with once-daily sessions of 10–15 minutes, progressing to 20–30 minutes as tolerated [^notfound].

- **Individualize**: Tailor frequency, duration, and intensity to patient tolerance and stability [^117AfPmR] [^113TTq5Z].

- **Monitor closely**: Use standardized safety criteria and stop rules [^113TTq5Z] [^1177rXS1].

- **Multidisciplinary team**: Involve physical therapy, nursing, respiratory therapy, and physicians [^112yCf2X].

---

Early active mobilization should begin **within 2–3 days** of ICU admission, with **once-daily sessions** of 20–30 minutes, progressing from passive to active exercises as tolerated. This approach balances potential benefits in muscle strength and function with safety, using individualized assessment and close monitoring to minimize adverse events [^113RbMsm] [^114APW75].

### The cost-effectiveness of early active mobilization during mechanical ventilation in the ICU: an economic evaluation alongside the treatment of mechanically ventilated adults with early activity and mobilization (TEAM) trial [^116rmRqz]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives:

Early mobilization is recommended by the Society of Critical Care Medicine ICU Liberation Bundle. The Treatment of Mechanically Ventilated Adults With Early Activity and Mobilization (TEAM) randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared early active mobilization to usual care mobilization and found no difference in the primary outcome of days alive and out of hospital to day 180; however, it did find an increase in adverse events in the intervention group. To date, no RCT of early mobilization has reported costs or cost-effectiveness. We aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of early active mobilization from the perspective of the healthcare sector.

Design:

We conducted a prospective, within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis alongside the TEAM study.

Setting:

Forty-nine ICUs in six countries (Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, and Brazil).

Patients:

The cost-effectiveness analysis included 733 adult ICU patients who were undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation and enrolled in the TEAM study.

Interventions:

Early active mobilization or usual care mobilization

Measurements and Main Results:

A significantly higher number of hours were spent by staff in delivering high-dose early active mobilization vs. usual care mobilization; however, incremental costs were not significantly different between the groups ($1,823; 95% CI, –$10,552 to $12,027). EuroQoL-5D 5-level utility scores at 6 months were not significantly different between the groups (0.532 [, 0.021] vs. 0.548 [, 0.021]; p = 0.585). The probability of early active mobilization being cost-effective is less than 50%, even at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $200,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Sensitivity analyses incorporating meta-analysis data indicated that early active mobilization may be cost-saving; however, this involves the occurrence of lower QALY gains when compared with usual care mobilization.

Conclusions:

Our trial-based analysis found no evidence that higher-dose early active mobilization is a cost-effective intervention compared with usual care mobilization for mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients; however, results from sensitivity analyses provided some evidence that it may be cost saving if one is willing to accept poorer outcomes. Further research is necessary to determine whether there are scenarios in which early active mobilization provides value for money.

### Active mobilization for mechanically ventilated patients: a systematic review [^111Xje1q]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effectiveness and safety of active mobilization on improving physical function and hospital outcomes in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, SinoMed, and ISI Web of Knowledge were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, other comparative studies, and case series with 10 or more consecutive cases. Additional studies were identified through references, citation tracking, and by contacting the authors of eligible studies.

Study Selection

Two reviewers independently selected potential studies according to the inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the methodologic quality.

Data Synthesis

A narrative form was used to summarize study characteristics and outcomes, because the substantial heterogeneity between the individual studies precluded formal meta-analyses. Among the 17 eligible studies, 7 RCTs, 1 quasi-RCT, 1 prospective cohort study, and 1 history controlled study were used to examine the effectiveness; and 2 RCTs, 1 prospective cohort study, and 7 case series were used to examine the safety of active mobilization in patients receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours. We found that active mobilization may improve muscle strength, functional independence, and the ability to wean from ventilation and may decrease the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital. However, only 1 study reported that active mobilization reduced the 1-year mortality rate. No serious adverse events were reported among included studies.

Conclusions

Active mobilization appears to have a positive effect on physical function and hospital outcomes in mechanical ventilation patients. Early active mobilization protocols may be initiated safely in the ICU setting and continued in post-ICU settings. However, the current available studies have great heterogeneity and limited methodologic quality. Further research is needed to provide more robust evidence to support the effectiveness and safety of active mobilization.

### Early mobilization of trauma patients admitted to intensive care units: a systematic review and meta-analyses [^116247y2]. Injury (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the effect of early mobilization (EM) in trauma patients admitted to the ICU. Outcomes of interest included mortality, hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS), and duration of mechanical ventilation.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of 4 electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library) and the grey literature. Eligible study designs included randomized control trials, prospective cohorts, or retrospective cohorts. Studies must have compared EM to usual care (i.e., delayed or no mobilization) in trauma patients admitted to ICU. Overall, there were 2982 articles screened and 9 were included in the analysis. Two authors independently performed data extraction using a standardized form. Pertinent study design and population characteristics were recorded, as were prespecified outcome measures. Meta-analyses were performed using random effects models. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.

Results

Study cohorts ranged from 15 to 1132 patients (median 63) and varied in their inclusion criteria. Most studies utilized a progressive mobility protocol as their intervention. Mortality was reported in 5 studies, of which 3 observed a lower rate with EM; however, meta-analysis showed no difference in mortality between patients mobilized early and those receiving usual care. Eight studies reported on LOS (in-hospital and ICU); although all 8 studies found EM reduced LOS, the difference in LOS was not significant on meta-analysis. Finally, 3 studies reported on ventilator days, all of which observed a reduction in the EM group. On meta-analysis, duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly lower with EM (mean difference -1.18 days, 95% CI, -2.17 - -0.19).

Conclusions

Few studies have investigated the effects of EM in trauma ICU patients. The available evidence suggests that patients who receive EM require fewer days of mechanical ventilation, but have similar mortality and LOS compared to those receiving usual care.

Results

Study selection

In the first stage of the literature search, we found three high-quality systematic reviews published between 2015 and 2019, through which we identified 108 references. In the second stage, the systematic update search yielded further 2,299 records, and six references were identified through bibliographies from relevant publications. Twelve studies were finally included in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. Figure 1 shows the study selection process and the main reasons for exclusion at the different stages.

Study characteristics

The included studies provided data from 679 people randomized to systematic early mobilization and 625 people receiving one of the comparators. We categorized two studies as comparing systematic early against late mobilization and the majority of studies (9 out of 12) as comparing systematic early against standard early mobilization. Six studies did not report information on the time from ICU admission to first mobilization in the intervention group. Information about the timing difference between intervention and comparator group was unavailable for six studies, which were thus included in the standard early mobilization category. One study was categorized as comparing systematic early mobilization against no mobilization, but contributed data to secondary outcomes reported in Additional file 3 only.

An overview of the included studies, study participant characteristics and interventions is provided in Tables 1 and 2. There was considerable heterogeneity in the baseline characteristics of participants in terms of gender, age and disease severity, both between studies and between intervention and comparator groups within studies. While most studies included a diverse mix of diagnoses, three studies focused on specific populations such as cardiothoracic surgery or sepsis patients. While interventions primarily involved physical therapy, one study additionally investigated combined physical and cognitive therapy in one of the intervention groups. Two studies involved occupational therapy and two included neuromuscular electro-stimulation. None of the studies involved speech therapy or ICU diary keeping in addition to early mobilization.

### Systematic early versus late mobilization or standard early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1152UGzA]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients in intensive care units (ICUs) frequently suffer from ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW) and lasting physical and neurocognitive impairment, resulting in difficulties in achieving full functionality in their social and professional lives. As a consequence, ICU stays are associated with a reduced quality of life as well as increased utilization of medical care, costs and mortality.

The systematic early mobilization of ICU patients is commonly advocated as an intervention to improve patient outcomes and is part of various clinical practice guidelines. There is evidence from several studies that early mobilization may improve physical function, decrease the risk of acquiring ICUAW or delirium and shorten the time to weaning from mechanical ventilation. However, some systematic reviews found no or inconclusive evidence for a benefit. It is not fully clear how the inconsistency in effects between studies arises. While heterogeneity in study populations and modality or intensity of study interventions may play a role, the timing of early mobilization has been discussed as an important factor for the effectiveness of the intervention, with earlier interventions showing greater benefit. However, the definition of standard care is not consistent between trials and may have changed over time as early mobilization was increasingly adopted in clinical practice. Thus, standard care may involve mobilization approaches that are also provided early, but less systematically. This may complicate the evaluation of the effects of early mobilization.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to determine the effectiveness of systematic early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients, while explicitly considering the timing of the delivery of the comparator intervention.

MRC Sum Score

Five studies reported on MRC-SS at ICU discharge. Four studies found no statistically significant difference between systematic early mobilization and late mobilization or standard early mobilization. Dantas et al. reported a statistically significantly higher MRC-SS in favor of systematic early mobilization compared with standard early mobilization. However, the mean MRC-SS of participants in the systematic early mobilization group was already higher at baseline compared to the comparator group. Meta-analysis including data from four studies (203 patients) showed no statistically significant difference in MRC-SS at ICU discharge between systematic early mobilization and standard early mobilization (MD 5.8 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) − 1.4 to 13.0; p = 0.12; I² = 81.7%; very low certainty; Fig. 3). In a sensitivity analysis, we excluded the study by Dantas et al. due to the baseline imbalance in MRC-SS, which may have affected their results. We found no evidence for a between-group difference in this analysis (MD 2.2; 95% CI − 2.5 to 6.9; p = 0.36; I² = 41.2%; low certainty).

Fig. 3
Meta-analysis results on MRC Sum Scores at ICU discharge and proportion of patients developing ICU-acquired weakness during hospitalization

Proportion of patients developing ICUAW during hospitalization

While four studies published results on the proportion of patients developing ICUAW during hospitalization, none of these found a statistically significantly lower rate of ICUAW in the systematic early mobilization group compared to late mobilization or standard early mobilization groups. A meta-analysis of all four studies (499 patients) showed no statistically significant difference in the incidence of ICUAW between groups (Fig. 3). However, the effects may be clinically meaningful, with a 38% reduction in the risk for developing ICUAW for systematic early mobilization compared with late mobilization (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.38–1.02; p = 0.06; I² = 0.0%; one study; low certainty), and a 10% risk reduction for systematic early compared with standard early mobilization (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.63–1.27; p = 0.54; I² = 33.3%; very low certainty).

### Expert consensus and recommendations on safety criteria for active mobilization of mechanically ventilated critically ill adults [^116LCTAZ]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

In the past, critically ill patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation were often managed with deep sedation and bed rest, at least during the early stages of their ICU admission. Despite long-standing evidence that prolonged bed rest results in deconditioning, studies investigating the effectiveness of early progressive mobilization for ICU patients have only started appearing in the literature in the last 10 to 15 years. While the earlier publications documented the feasibility, safety and physiological effects associated with the mobilization of ICU patients, point-prevalence studies and controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of early progressive mobilization have been published in more recent years. These studies, and concomitant systematic reviews, provide evidence that early progressive mobilization of adult ICU patients is feasible, safe, and may result in benefits including improved functional outcomes, and reduced ICU and hospital length of stay.

These findings are contributing to a shift in ICU clinical practice, where patients who once would have received deep sedation and bed rest, are now less heavily sedated and receive early progressive mobilization. The incidence of reported adverse events associated with early progressive mobilization of ICU patients is low (≤ 4%). Moreover, most of these adverse events were transient and benign. Whilst it is important that consideration is given to the potential benefits versus the potential adverse events associated with early progressive mobilization, it is possible that undue concern about adverse events may be resulting in mobilization being withheld where it might otherwise be beneficial. In order for early progressive mobilization to be undertaken safely in an ICU setting, with a minimal risk of adverse sequelae, it is essential that patients be carefully assessed prior to any mobilization intervention. Such assessment is facilitated by the availability of objective criteria that indicate that it is reasonable or safe to initiate mobilization. A logical process for the development of such criteria is to utilize expert opinion to achieve consensus and, subsequently, determine the validity of these criteria by empiric research. The aim of this study was to develop consensus recommendations on safety criteria that should be considered prior to mobilizing adult, mechanically ventilated, ICU patients.

### Should early mobilization Be routine in mechanically ventilated patients? [^117Xe47B]. Respiratory Care (2016). Low credibility.

ICU-acquired weakness is a major complication of critical illness requiring mechanical ventilation. Early mobilization has been shown to decrease the negative consequences of ICU-acquired weakness. However, early mobilization might entail risks to the patient. Additional staffing needs might have a negative financial impact. This review examines whether early mobilization should be routinely performed in mechanically ventilated patients.

### Effects of robotic-assisted early mobilization versus conventional mobilization in intensive care unit patients: prospective interventional cohort study with retrospective control group analysis [^117Rhznz]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately every third survivor of critical illness suffers from intensive-care-unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW). Affected patients show a reduction in muscle mass, strength, and function and suffer from increased mortality and impaired quality of life. Known risk factors are mechanical ventilation, severe sepsis, organ dysfunctions, neuro/myotoxic agents, and immobilization. By specifically counteracting immobilization, active mobilization may mitigate some negative effects of ICUAW.

The effects of robotic-assisted mobilization on the critically ill have not yet been investigated. In the rehabilitation after stroke, addition of robotic-mobilization increases the chances of regaining independent walking abilities especially if applied early and in the non-ambulatory. If robotic assistance can reasonably be integrated into the intensive care setting, it could support early mobilization and relieve mobilizing professionals. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of robotic mobilization and verticalization on the outcomes of critical care patients and compare them to a conventionally mobilized historical cohort. The primary outcome measure was the duration of mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcome measures were the length of ICU stay, muscle parameters, and quality of life after three months.

### Assessing the impact of early progressive mobilization on moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury: a randomized controlled trial [^114CLpNh]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our results advocate for the incorporation of the EPM protocol into early rehabilitation intervention for patients with moderate-to-severe TBI, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving mobility and functional independence. Furthermore, initiating early mobilization within the first week post-injury significantly decreases the length of ICU stay and the need for mechanical ventilation, emphasizing the critical role of early intervention in enhancing moderate-to-severe TBI patient recovery outcomes.

### What is the proper approach to liberating the weak from mechanical ventilation? [^116rYE16]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The general issue of weaning can be viewed as composed of three different groups of patients. First, simple or easy weaning, represents 60% to 70% of patients whose first trial of spontaneous breathing is successful. The main objective of the weaning process is to detect weaning readiness as early as possible, which is best achieved using a systematic approach. The percentage of patients in this group in a given intensive care unit represents the pretest probability of weaning. A second group is made of patients who experience failure of the first spontaneous breathing trial and in whom up to 7 days from the first trial may be required to achieve weaning. This group represents 20% to 25% of patients who undergo weaning from mechanical ventilation. Muscle weakness contributes to the prolongation of weaning in many of these patients. The last group is made of patients who are characterized by a prolonged or very difficult weaning process (about 5% to 15% of patients undergoing weaning). Muscle weakness is likely to be a major contributing factor. Early use of spontaneous breathing, well-controlled use of sedation, and early mobilization may help in reducing muscle weakness and hasten the weaning process. The postextubation period may be particularly at risk in these patients. More research is needed to guide clinicians regarding the best ventilatory management.

Physical conditioning — early mobility recommends to provide early exercise and mobilization (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE); early exercise and mobilization programs may shorten duration of mechanical ventilation, reduce ICU length of stay, lower VAP rates, and increase the rate of return to independent function, with no consistent association between early mobilization and hospital length of stay or mortality, and financial modeling suggests that early mobility programs may be cost saving.

Weaning and sedation protocols have contributed to the management of weaning in important ways over the past 15 years. New developments in this specialty are targeted at discontinuing invasive ventilatory support in a timely manner by using automated systems or non-invasive ventilation as a weaning strategy, and awakening and mobilising critically ill patients as soon as possible. Applying protocols to real life clinical practice can be difficult because their effectiveness depends on many factors, including their acceptability to clinicians, the workload of the intensive care unit, the requirement for frequent assessments, and monitoring to ensure compliance. Thus, automated computerised systems are increasingly being used in an attempt to improve the adaptation of mechanical support to the needs of individual patients during weaning and to reduce the time spent on ventilation, costs, and staff workload. Computers can continuously monitor changes in ventilation, interpret real time physiological changes, and adapt ventilation in response to these changes. As shown in this review, however, compared with usual care their efficacy in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation has yet to be established. Nevertheless, the use of weaning protocols is increasing to the point where it is "usual practice" in many units, and we are now beginning to see more studies that compare automated weaning with weaning with a protocol.

Non-invasive ventilation (where the endotracheal tube is removed, but the patient continues to receive ventilatory support delivered by face or nasal mask) is gaining popularity as a weaning strategy. To date the number of trials are small (around five), but a recent systematic review has shown the clinical benefit of this strategy in reducing the total duration of mechanical ventilation support in cases of difficult weaning, particularly in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

In patients in intensive care, mechanical ventilation and immobilisation contribute to complications such as delirium and weakness, which can affect the duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay in intensive care and hospital. A recent randomised controlled trial of early mobilisation instigated during periods of daily sedation breaks showed significantly shorter durations of delirium (median 2 v 4 days, P = 0.02) and more ventilator-free days (median 23.5 v 21.1 days, P = 0.05).

### Early mobilization using a mobile patient lift in the ICU: a randomized controlled trial [^112ciwrN]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Using mobile patient lifts for ICU patients on mechanical ventilation may improve their physical function during ICU admission by accelerating the standing process. The results need to be validated in studies designed to be at lower risk of bias. Verification of safety is also required.

### Early mobilization and recovery in mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU: a bi-national, multi-centre, prospective cohort study [^112oFyV7]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Mobilisation activities

Of our cohort, 122 (63.5%) patients did not receive early mobilisation. We collected information during 1,288 patient–physiotherapy interactions while patients were mechanically ventilated (Figure 2). No early mobilisation occurred in 1,079 (84%) of these episodes. The first physiotherapy sessions occurred early in the ICU stay (median 2 days from ICU admission, IQR 2 to 4 days) as the patients could be seen for respiratory physiotherapy or for early mobilisation.

Figure 2
Flow of included patients through the study from days 1 to 14. Data for the number of patients invasively ventilated and mobilising (active), invasively ventilated and inactive, dead, extubated or discharged from the ICU.

Of the 70 patients (36.5%) who received early mobilisation during mechanical ventilation, the median (IQR) time from ICU admission to early mobilisation was 5 (3 to 8) days and the median (IQR) number of active mobilisation episodes per patient was 2 (1 to 4). There was no difference in any baseline variables between patients who were mobilised compared with patients who were not mobilised. There were 209 recorded episodes of early mobilisation. Among these episodes, the maximum levels of mobilisation were exercise in bed (n = 94, 45%), passively transferred to sitting (n = 52, 25%), sitting over the edge of the bed (dangling, n = 22, 11%), standing at the bedside (n = 11, 5%), transferring from bed to chair through standing (n = 4, 2%) or walking (n = 26, 12%) (Figure 3). One-quarter of these patients were mobilised by day 3 and one-third by day 4. No mechanically ventilated patients were walking before day 7. All patients who were mobilised out of bed and stood had a Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale score of –1 to +1, while some patients were able to sit over the edge of the bed with a Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale score of between –2 and +2.

### Expert consensus and recommendations on safety criteria for active mobilization of mechanically ventilated critically ill adults [^113TTq5Z]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This study reports on the development of consensus recommendations outlining safety considerations prior to the mobilization of adult, mechanically ventilated patients in an ICU setting. The implementation of these recommendations has the potential to maximize early mobilization while minimizing the risk of adverse safety events, which in turn might improve functional outcomes and translate into reduced ICU and hospital length of stay. Future research required includes systematic evaluation of these recommendations.

### Early mobilization reduces duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit stay in patients with acute respiratory failure [^115z7qob]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of a quality improvement program to introduce early mobilization on the outcomes of patients with mechanical ventilation (MV) in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Design

A retrospective observational study.

Setting

Nineteen-bed ICU at a medical center.

Participants

Adults patients with MV (N = 153) admitted to a medical ICU.

Interventions

A multidisciplinary team (critical care nurse, nursing assistant, respiratory therapist, physical therapist, patient's family) initiated the protocol within 72 hours of MV when patients become hemodynamically stable. We did early mobilization twice daily, 5d/wk during family visits (30min each time), and cooperated with family, if possible.

Main Outcome Measures

MV duration, rate of successful weaning, and length of ICU and hospital stay.

Results

We enrolled 63 patients in the before protocol group and 90 in the after protocol group. The 2 groups were well matched in age, sex, body height, body weight, body mass index, disease severity, cause of intubation, number of comorbidities, and most underlying diseases. After protocol group patients had shorter MV durations (4.7d vs 7.5d; P < .001) and ICU stays (6.9d vs 9.9d; p = 0.001) than did before protocol group patients. Early mobilization was negatively associated with the duration of MV (β = -.269; P < .002; 95% confidence interval [CI] -4.767 to -1.072), and the risk of MV for ≥ 7 days was lower in patients who underwent early mobilization (odds ratio, .082; 95% CI, .021-.311).

Conclusions

The introduction of early mobilization for patients with MV in the ICU shortened MV durations and ICU stays. A multidisciplinary team that includes the patient's family can work together to improve the patient's clinical outcomes.

### Ten strategies to optimize early mobilization and rehabilitation in intensive care [^113LY2YF]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Assess outcomes and performance

Mobility and rehabilitation-related measures, appropriate to the ICU setting and integrated into clinical care, are needed to set patient goals and track their progress, allocate scarce rehabilitation resources to those patients who may benefit the most, and conduct evaluations of structured quality improvement programs. Understanding patients' functioning prior to critical illness, and their own goals, are also important considerations.

### Liberation from mechanical ventilation in critically ill adults: an Official American College of Chest Physicians / American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: inspiratory pressure augmentation during spontaneous breathing trials, protocols minimizing sedation, and noninvasive ventilation immediately after extubation [^113uQBmh]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

ATS/CHEST guideline — early mobilization rehabilitation after mechanical ventilation > 24 h: For acutely hospitalized adults who have been mechanically ventilated for > 24 h, we suggest protocolized rehabilitation directed toward early mobilization (Conditional Recommendation, Low Quality Evidence), and there is insufficient evidence to recommend any rehabilitation protocol over another. The evidence synthesis demonstrated that patients who received an intervention directed toward early mobilization had a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and were more likely to be able to walk at hospital discharge. There were no differences in mortality, ICU length of stay, ability to walk at ICU discharge, 6-min walk distance, or ventilator-free days. Low rates of serious adverse events, including arrhythmias, have been reported. This recommendation places a high value on reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation and maintenance of ambulation and a lower value on cost and resource use.

### Early mobilization and rehabilitation of patients who are critically ill [^1136n3MP]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Neuromuscular disorders are increasingly recognized as a cause of both short- and long-term physical morbidity in survivors of critical illness. This recognition has given rise to research aimed at better understanding the risk factors and mechanisms associated with neuromuscular dysfunction and physical impairment associated with critical illness, as well as possible interventions to prevent or treat these issues. Among potential risk factors, bed rest is an important modifiable risk factor. Early mobilization and rehabilitation of patients who are critically ill may help prevent or mitigate the sequelae of bed rest and improve patient outcomes. Research studies and quality improvement projects have demonstrated that early mobilization and rehabilitation are safe and feasible in patients who are critically ill, with potential benefits including improved physical functioning and decreased duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care, and hospital stay. Despite these findings, early mobilization and rehabilitation are still uncommon in routine clinical practice, with many perceived barriers. This review summarizes potential risk factors for neuromuscular dysfunction and physical impairment associated with critical illness, highlights the potential role of early mobilization and rehabilitation in improving patient outcomes, and discusses some of the commonly perceived barriers to early mobilization and strategies for overcoming them.

### Expert consensus and recommendations on safety criteria for active mobilization of mechanically ventilated critically ill adults [^112kTgUe]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

A group of 23 multidisciplinary experts who had considerable clinical experience and were currently involved in research about early mobilization of adult ICU patients were invited to participate in a consensus meeting. All participants were based at tertiary centers. All 23 invitees attended a face-to-face meeting on 21 June 2013. These 23 participants comprised 17 physiotherapists, 5 intensivists and 1 nurse, who were from Australia (n = 19), United States (n = 2), New Zealand (n = 1) and Finland (n = 1).

Prior to the face-to-face meeting, a systematic review of the literature was performed by two members of the group (CH, CT). Protocols and publications that outlined safety criteria for early mobilization in ICU were identified and distributed to the group. Additionally, any publication or protocol that a member of the consensus committee deemed important was circulated prior to the meeting.

The face-to-face meeting was divided into three parts. First, there were presentations from individual panel members of any published or unpublished safety criteria for mobilization. Second, the panel members were divided into small working groups to determine where there was clear agreement and where further discussion was required regarding safety criteria. Third, the entire group then re-formed and discussed the recommendations from the smaller working parties in order to determine where consensus had been reached and where further discussion was required. Following the face-to-face meeting, a summary of the safety criteria for mobilization was drafted and, using an iterative process, was circulated to panel members via email until the group had reached consensus or agreed that they could not reach consensus. Consensus was defined as 100% agreement amongst the group.

### Early mobilization and rehabilitation in the ICU: moving back to the future [^116VhScd]. Respiratory Care (2016). Low credibility.

Despite the historical precedent of mobilizing critically ill patients, bed rest is common practice in ICUs worldwide, especially for mechanically ventilated patients. ICU-acquired weakness is an increasingly recognized problem, with sequelae that may last for months and years following ICU discharge. The combination of critical illness and bed rest results in substantial muscle wasting during an ICU stay. When initiated shortly after the start of mechanical ventilation, mobilization and rehabilitation can play an important role in decreasing the duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay and improving patients' return to functional independence. This review summarizes recent evidence supporting the safety, feasibility, and benefits of early mobilization and rehabilitation of mechanically ventilated patients and presents a brief summary of future directions for this field.

### Early rehabilitation with dedicated use of belt-type electrical muscle stimulation for severe COVID-19 patients [^113n3LZf]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has produced a global pandemic. Many patients, mainly those with plural risk factors, have developed to critically ill status and have required intensive care including mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Although evidence remains limited about how long mechanical ventilation is generally necessary, 1 to 2 weeks of ventilation usage are typically prepared to treat severe cases of COVID-19. Because intensive care unit (ICU) acquired weakness (ICU-AW) often accompanies acute respiratory distress syndrome, treatment of ICU-AW is fundamentally important for clinical practice for COVID-19.

Early mobilization and exercise are vitally necessary to treat severe COVID-19. In an international expert team's guide to physiotherapy management for COVID-19, early exercise is recommended, with active involvement by a physiotherapist, after ICU treatment. However, in actual practice, active early rehabilitation can frequently not be performed for various reasons such as exhaustion of medical resources, especially of personal protective equipment. Moreover, Chinese recommendations for respiratory rehabilitation have suggested avoidance of early rehabilitation in the acute phase of severe COVID-19.

To reduce exposure and to conserve medical resources, service automation is also desired in early mobilization. Electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) is an exclusive automated method of physiotherapy used in current critical care. As discussed for EMS efficacy, its use in early acute phase can contribute to the countering of ICU-AW if combined with optimal nutrition therapy including adequate protein delivery. Automated EMS is expected to be an ideal mobilization for severe COVID-19 patients.

Moreover, among the various modes of EMS, belt-type EMS is expected to be effective for critical care because it can induce whole lower extremity exercise through whole muscle contraction between wrapped belts. Exposure to medical staff can be minimized while realizing frequent actuation with a longer duration for each bout of stimulation by assigning each COVID-19 patient a dedicated belt-type EMS, for which no belt change would be necessary (Fig. 1). At Hitachi General Hospital, we assigned each ventilated COVID-19 patients a dedicated belt-type EMS: a measure which achieved better outcomes by administration of 50 min bouts, with three bouts per day, requiring only switching on by a nurse.

### Clinical practice guideline: early mobilization and rehabilitation of critically ill burn patients [^113G7em3]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2023). High credibility.

Early mobilization in adult burn ICU patients — Gille et al evaluated an intervention aimed at facilitating early spontaneous breathing in adults with burns with an abbreviated burn severity index ≥ 7, which included early active mobilization starting on postoperative day 1 to a chair or walking. Compared with historical controls, the protocol group had significant reductions in continued hours of ventilation and total ventilator days, and 73% of patients had been extubated within 24 hours compared with only 36% in the controls. However, the mobilization component was not described in detail and no data showed how much mobilization was delivered, making it impossible to determine with confidence the specific effects of early mobilization on duration of ventilation.

### Safety assessment criteria for early active mobilization in mechanically ventilated ICU subjects [^115nBGLa]. Respiratory Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although studies have confirmed the safety and feasibility of early active mobilization, its implementation status is still unsatisfactory. The most important obstacle is ensuring patient safety. Comprehensively assessing the physical condition of patients considered for mobilization is the basis of safety. However, appropriate guidance is lacking. We performed a systematic review to extract and summarize current safety assessment criteria for the early active mobilization of mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU.

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted using English and Chinese databases according to the PRISMA checklist and guidelines to identify relevant original studies that evaluated safety assessment variables and specific parameters.

Results

A total of 24 medium- and high-quality articles involving a total of 4,842 subjects were included in the analysis. Among these studies, there were 15 randomized controlled trials involving 1,777 subjects (888 in the control groups, 889 in the interventional groups) and 9 cohort studies involving 3,065 subjects (1,240 in the control groups, 1,825 in the exposure groups). There were 5 safety assessment criteria, including cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, musculoskeletal, and other. Within these were 17 different variables and 48 specific parameters.

Conclusions

The safety assessment criteria should focus on cardiac reserve, respiratory reserve, consciousness, and muscle strength. It is especially important to note whether the parameters are stable because parameter stability can be more representative of a patient's condition than absolute values. We provide a flow diagram for clinical safety assessments; however, some limitations exist, and this assessment requires further validation and optimization.

### Effect of neuromuscular electrical stimulation combined with early rehabilitation therapy on mechanically ventilated patients: a prospective randomized controlled study [^111bcVQM]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Early pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with MV can be divided into passive exercise and active exercise. Early mobility and exercise, an important part of ABCDE bundle to prevent delirium in critical ill patients, has been proved feasible, safe, and beneficial for patients with prolonged MV in the ICU. Active mobilization and rehabilitation in the ICU improves mobility status, increases muscle strength, and elongates the survival time of patients. The combination of early mobility with other complementary care processes creates a holistic approach to clinical care, helps patients recover, and creates a philosophy of care that is greater than the sum of its parts.

Passive exercise is suitable for patients who cannot cooperate, including passive limb movement, passive bedside cycling, and NMES. As an alternative therapy for mobilization and exercise, NMES is particularly suitable for patients who are bedridden. The involvement of motor units during NMES contraction differs from the underlying spontaneous activation. NMES activate sensory pathways through movement and cause depolarization of peripheral motor nerves. However, the mechanism for strengthening muscle has not been fully understood. One theory is that NMES may increase muscle strength just like that of voluntary activity. Another hypothesis is that NMES stimulate motor units to recruit type II fibers and cause contractions, which are the opposite of normal contractions, to achieve a more significant muscle-building effect than voluntary exercise alone. In addition, peripheral application of NMES can evoke a wide range of activities in the central nervous system, which can lead to a series of neural adjustments and adaptations. Therefore, the combination of NMES and routine rehabilitation may achieve the recruitment of more motor units, the recovery of nerve function, and the improvement of muscle strength. Previous study recommended that NMES should be performed for 60 min a day, with the recommended stimulation intensity of 45 Hz and the recommended frequency of once a day. In this study, each NMES session lasted 30 min and the parameters were set as 50 Hz frequency. Four patients in the NMES group suffered adverse effects, including increased blood pressure and decreased oxygen saturation, and two of them suffered intractable hiccups, which resolved after discontinuation of neuromuscular electrical stimulation and medical treatment. One patient experienced a drop in blood pressure during routine rehabilitation and recovered after stopping rehabilitation. Although the rate and duration of NMES used in this study are different from those previously reported, the results of this study suggest that such frequency of operation is still safe and effective.

### Clinical practice guideline: early mobilization and rehabilitation of critically ill burn patients [^117L4zX4]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2023). High credibility.

Early mobilization and rehabilitation (EMR) — duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) in critically ill adult burn patients: No recommendation is made to initiate EMR to reduce MV duration because evidence is insufficient; there is no available scientific evidence in burn literature, insufficient evidence in non-burn ICU literature, and overall lack of confidence to recommend EMR to shorten MV duration in this population.

### Systematic early versus late mobilization or standard early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Hbfhn]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Interpretation

We found considerable heterogeneity between the included studies. First, there were important differences in study populations. While most studies included a mixed ICU collective, three were limited to postoperative or septic patients. There were large differences between studies in the average length of ICU and hospital stay, as well as in the duration of mechanical ventilation, indicating marked differences in patient recovery between studies. However, on a study level, longer hospitalization and ventilation were barely associated with higher disease severity, as reflected by average Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) scores. We thus consider it likely that these differences were due to variations in standard ICU practices, reasons for ICU admission or other patient characteristics.

Second, there were differences in the interventions provided in the studies. While almost all studies described a diverse set of exercises, tailored to the patient's capability and increasing intensity over time, the systematic early mobilization interventions differed markedly in their scope, intensity and composition between studies. Furthermore, the allocated intervention extended beyond hospital discharge in two studies, which did not appear to result in stronger effects on muscle strength or physical function.

Third, the definition of 'early mobilization' and its distinction from 'standard care' were often unclear and varied strongly between studies. Standard care was often poorly described, and not all studies reported on differences in the timing of the first mobilization between study arms. Our approach of categorizing studies in comparing systematic early mobilization with either late mobilization or standard early mobilization partially accounted for this issue and revealed that the timing of mobilization in the comparator group may be an important explanatory factor for differences in effects between trials. It is possible that standard practice has evolved after earlier studies on early mobilization found strong effects compared with late mobilization, such as the one by Schweickert et al. This may have resulted in smaller differences in effects between intervention and control groups, especially in more recent trials which we categorized as comparing systematic early with standard early mobilization.

Finally, we judged most studies to be at risk of bias, which also affected our confidence in most estimates in the GRADE assessment. However, considering results from studies at low risk of bias only would have led to the same conclusions.

### To mobilise or not to mobilise: is that the right question? [^115rGZVT]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Similar to other trials of early mobilisation, the recent phase III trial (the TEAM trial) randomised 750 critically ill patients from 49 hospitals across six countries and has questioned the safety of early mobilisation compared to standard care. In this trial, participants were a mixed cohort, of whom 66% had sepsis, mean body mass index was 30, 62% received vasopressors, and 22% received renal replacement therapy. Adverse events were 2.5 times more likely to occur in the intervention group compared to usual care and were more likely to reoccur in the same patients. These resolved with cessation of the early mobilisation session. Following this trial, a systematic review of the effects of early mobilisation on 6-month functional recovery was completed. It included a Bayesian analysis of the data using vague priors, and reported 75% probability that early mobilisation was associated with an increase in days alive and out of hospital at 6 months, and 95% probability that it was associated with improved physical function at 6 months. However, it was also associated with 66% chance of increased adverse events and 72% chance of increased mortality at 6 months.

Overall, usual care groups have been poorly reported in the ICU rehabilitation literature. Of the studies that have reported the activities included in usual care, the content varies considerably. Activities may include passive (no patient participation, e.g. passive range of motion), active-assisted (some participation, e.g. active-assisted range of motion), or active participation. In the TEAM trial, the usual care group reported active or active-assisted mobilisation (i.e. sitting at the edge of bed or higher) for a mean duration of 9 min per day for approximately 5 days per week, as compared to 21 min, for approximately 7 days a week, in the intervention group. Similar mobility milestones were achieved in the usual care group compared to the intervention group, but not as quickly (i.e. 1–2 days later for major mobility milestones in the usual care group) in 89% of patients, including during invasive mechanical ventilation. On the other hand, the study by Patel and colleagues reported an improvement in cognitive function with early mobilisation compared to standard care. Standard care in this trial included only 6/99 (6%) patients who were mobilised during mechanical ventilation.

### Systematic early versus late mobilization or standard early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Khfmh]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Study types

Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English, German, French or Italian language were included. We did not consider observational evidence as we assumed a high probability of confounding by indication and differences in the provision of early mobilization between patients in a non-standardized, non-randomized setting.

Information sources and search strategy

To identify relevant studies, we followed a two-stage systematic search process based on previously published high-quality systematic reviews. In the first stage, we systematically searched the MEDLINE and Cochrane Library databases for relevant systematic reviews published between 2015 and 2019. We assessed the identified systematic reviews in full text for eligibility and selected high-quality systematic reviews based on the Assessing the Methodology of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR 2) assessment checklist. The selected high-quality systematic reviews were then used as a basis to identify potentially eligible RCTs. All records identified in these reviews were included in the full-text assessment in the second stage of our systematic review.

In the second stage, we performed a systematic follow-up search in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and CENTRAL databases to identify more recently published studies. We adopted the search strategies of the high-quality reviews, additionally applying the Cochrane sensitivity and precision-maximizing RCT filter. Each search was conducted for a timeframe starting two months prior to the last search in the respective review up to January 17, 2019, to account for a potential lag in the indexing of publications (see Additional file 1 for detailed search strategies). Additional references were identified through bibliographies of included studies and registry records. We screened the title and abstract of all records retrieved through the update searches and pooled potentially eligible records with the records retrieved from the high-quality systematic reviews. After deduplication, we assessed the pooled references in full text to select eligible studies. All study selection processes were carried out independently and in duplicate by three reviewers. Disagreements were resolved by consensus with an experienced senior reviewer.

Data extraction

We extracted information regarding the study design, study population characteristics, intervention and comparator details (i.e. modality, timing, frequency, duration), measured outcomes and follow-up. Where reporting of intervention, comparator or results was insufficient to allow judgments about the categorization of studies, we consulted study protocols and contacted authors for additional information. Data extraction was performed in duplicate by three reviewers.

### Effect of neuromuscular electrical stimulation in critically ill adults with mechanical ventilation: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113RYEkB]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Critically ill patients often experience prolonged periods of bed rest and inactivity resulting from their stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), and this is particularly true for those requiring mechanical ventilation (MV). Such patients are at a heightened risk of rapid muscle mass deterioration, with approximately 37% exhibiting signs of muscle atrophy as early as the fourth day of their ICU admittance. This loss of skeletal muscle is correlated with diminished physical capabilities, extended duration of mechanical ventilation, prolonged ICU stays, and an increase in mortality. Therefore, it is essential to implement immediate strategies to mitigate muscle degradation as promptly as possible for these individuals.

Early physical rehabilitation, including early mobility and exercise during the initial days of ICU admission for ventilated patients, stands as a crucial method to influence or even prevent skeletal muscle debilitation and atrophy. Studies have shown that early physiotherapy protocol can enhance muscle quality and functionality in critically ill patients, as well as decrease length of ICU stay and mechanical ventilation duration. Nonetheless, early and intensive mobilization in ventilated patients presents challenges due to their severe conditions, high levels of ventilatory support, or impaired consciousness. In the early stages, feasible exercises for these patients typically involve low-intensity or passive activities, such as passive cycling at the bedside. Another obstacle to early active rehabilitation is the potential insufficient duration of available physiotherapy time, often due to the lack of physiotherapists. Consequently, there is a need for alternative or supplemental rehabilitation methodologies that do not rely on patient cooperation or that utilize automated devices.

### An official American Thoracic Society / American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline: liberation from mechanical ventilation in critically ill adults. rehabilitation protocols, ventilator liberation protocols, and cuff leak tests [^111iwTpV]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ATS/CHEST guideline — early mobilization rehabilitation in acutely hospitalized adults mechanically ventilated for more than 24 hours: In pooled analyses, intervention directed toward early mobilization was associated with a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference, 2.7 fewer days) and a higher ability to walk at hospital discharge (64.0% vs. 41.4%; RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.15–2.10), with no meaningful differences in mortality, ICU length of stay, ability to walk at ICU discharge, 6-minute-walk distance, or ventilator-free days. The panel considered the 2.7-day reduction to be large relative to an 8-day average duration across the four trials, and a large case series reported low serious adverse event rates during rehabilitation (6.5 events per 1,000 physical therapy sessions) and for arrhythmias (1.9 events per 1,000 physical therapy sessions). For acutely hospitalized adults who have been mechanically ventilated for more than 24 hours, the panel states "we suggest protocolized rehabilitation directed toward early mobilization (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the evidence)", with the remark that "There is insufficient evidence to recommend any rehabilitation protocol over another", and values and preferences that "place a high value on reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation and increasing the likelihood of being able to walk at discharge and a lower value on cost and resource use".

### Ten strategies to optimize early mobilization and rehabilitation in intensive care [^115uup5d]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Evidence is still evolving about early mobilization in ICU with ongoing large, multi-center trials. Further research is needed to understand the optimal timing, type and dose of interventions, and their effect on long-term patient outcomes. These 10 strategies provide guidance for implementing early mobilization and rehabilitation in the ICU with the goal of optimizing safety and effectiveness to improve patients' experiences and outcomes.

### Dose of early therapeutic mobility: does type or frequency… [^115QBKx3]. ClinicalTrials (2009). Low credibility.

Study Overview Early therapeutic mobility activity has been recommended to facilitate recovery and improve outcomes for the survivors of critical illness who experience prolonged mechanical ventilation. The effective dose of ETM activity is not known and there are limited reports about the application and effects of ETM in mechanically ventilated intensive care unit patients. The primary aim of this interdisciplinary study is to compare the immediate effects of frequency — single and twice daily episodes — of ETM activity and the effects of type — low and moderate intensity — of ETM activity on molecular biomarkers of inflammation and systemic markers of physical health in mechanically ventilated adults. This is an experimental design, using repeated measures; subjects will be randomized to receive either one or two episodes of ETM activity daily during week days while in the ICU. Type of activity will be determined by patient condition.

The research questions are:

- a. What are the differences between frequency of ETM activities on systemic markers of physical health: vital signs, delirium, muscle strength, ventilator-associated pneumonia and duration of mechanical ventilation.
2. b. What are the differences between type of ETM activities on systemic markers of physical health: vital signs, delirium, muscle strength, ventilator-associated pneumonia and duration of mechanical ventilation. Data will be collected for a maximum of 3 contiguous days in ICU patients who are mechanically ventilated for > 48 hours, then weekly to examine short-term patient responses to ETM activities in this preliminary study. Daily episodes of activity will be provided by a study interventionist. Repeated measures MANCOVA and ANCOVA will be used to answer the research questions.

This collaborative study evaluates a biobehavioral methodology within an interdisciplinary team consistent with the biobehavioral methods to improve outcome research and the mission of the National Institute of Nursing Research to improve treatments and health based on evidence.

### A binational multicenter pilot feasibility randomized controlled trial of early goal-directed mobilization in the ICU [^111WRw7B]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine if the early goal-directed mobilization intervention could be delivered to patients receiving mechanical ventilation with increased maximal levels of activity compared with standard care.

Design

A pilot randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Five ICUs in Australia and New Zealand.

Participants

Fifty critically ill adults mechanically ventilated for greater than 24 hours.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to either early goal-directed mobilization (intervention) or to standard care (control). Early goal-directed mobilization comprised functional rehabilitation treatment conducted at the highest level of activity possible for that patient assessed by the ICU mobility scale while receiving mechanical ventilation.

Measurements and Main Results

The ICU mobility scale, strength, ventilation duration, ICU and hospital length of stay, and total inpatient (acute and rehabilitation) stay as well as 6-month post-ICU discharge health-related quality of life, activities of daily living, and anxiety and depression were recorded. The mean age was 61 years and 60% were men. The highest level of activity (ICU mobility scale) recorded during the ICU stay between the intervention and control groups was mean (95% CI) 7.3 (6.3–8.3) versus 5.9 (4.9–6.9), p = 0.05. The proportion of patients who walked in ICU was almost doubled with early goal-directed mobilization (intervention n = 19 [66%] vs control n = 8 [38%]; p = 0.05). There was no difference in total inpatient stay (d) between the intervention versus control groups (20 [15–35] vs 34 [18–43]; p = 0.37). There were no adverse events.

Conclusions

Key Practice Points: Delivery of early goal-directed mobilization within a randomized controlled trial was feasible, safe and resulted in increased duration and level of active exercises.

### Expert consensus and recommendations on safety criteria for active mobilization of mechanically ventilated critically ill adults [^116LQDW6]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The strength of the safety recommendations outlined in this paper is that they are based on evidence from relevant clinical studies and required consensus of panel members, all of whom have clinical expertise and were currently involved in research regarding the early mobilization of ICU patients. There are several limitations to the current study as follows. The consensus group was predominantly comprised of clinicians working in Australia, therefore the recommendations may be reflective of Australian ICU culture and practice and thus may not be generalizable to other countries. However, the results of the consensus were presented at the Seventh International Meeting of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in Critically Ill held in San Diego on 17 May 2014. At this meeting there were 94 multidisciplinary clinicians, from both academic and non-academic hospitals, interested in early mobilization in ICU. Each of the criteria was discussed individually as documented and consensus was sought from attendees. Consensus was reached when 100% of attendees agreed to the proposed wording of the document. As a result of their feedback, minor amendments were made to the consensus document to reflect international practice. It is also acknowledged that the consensus recommendations are predominantly based on the experts' interpretation of literature and their opinions which are based on their clinical practice.

Further research is required to validate each of the safety considerations discussed in these recommendations and the recommendations as a whole, both in centers with expertise in ICU mobilization and in centers without. Furthermore, as early progressive mobilization continues to be more extensively practiced and researched, and critical care medicine advances, it may be that criteria currently noted in red may become yellow in future versions of these recommendations. Finally, while the consensus group discussed safety parameters that should be assessed prior to mobilization, safety parameters that should be monitored during mobilization interventions were not considered.

### Expert consensus and recommendations on safety criteria for active mobilization of mechanically ventilated critically ill adults [^112s4JeR]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The aim of this study was to develop consensus recommendations on safety parameters for mobilizing adult, mechanically ventilated, intensive care unit (ICU) patients.

Methods

A systematic literature review was followed by a meeting of 23 multidisciplinary ICU experts to seek consensus regarding the safe mobilization of mechanically ventilated patients.

Results

Safety considerations were summarized in four categories: respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological and other. Consensus was achieved on all criteria for safe mobilization, with the exception being levels of vasoactive agents. Intubation via an endotracheal tube was not a contraindication to early mobilization and a fraction of inspired oxygen less than 0.6 with a percutaneous oxygen saturation more than 90% and a respiratory rate less than 30 breaths/minute were considered safe criteria for in- and out-of-bed mobilization if there were no other contraindications. At an international meeting, 94 multidisciplinary ICU clinicians concurred with the proposed recommendations.

Conclusion

Consensus recommendations regarding safety criteria for mobilization of adult, mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU have the potential to guide ICU rehabilitation whilst minimizing the risk of adverse events.

### The cost-effectiveness of early active mobilization during mechanical ventilation in the ICU: an economic evaluation alongside the treatment of mechanically ventilated adults with early activity and mobilization (TEAM) trial [^112iML5X]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: What is the cost-effectiveness of higher-dose early active mobilization compared with usual care mobilization for mechanically ventilated adults in ICU?

Findings: In this cost-effectiveness analysis alongside the Treatment of Mechanically Ventilated Adults With Early Activity and Mobilization (TEAM) randomized controlled trial, early active mobilization resulted in higher costs and produced less quality-adjusted life years than usual care mobilization, although the differences were not statistically significant. The probability of early active mobilization being cost-effective was less than 50%, although there was a high degree of uncertainty around the results.

Meanings: The trial-based analysis did not find evidence that higher-dose early active mobilization is a cost-effective intervention compared with usual care mobilization for mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients.

Healthcare consumes more than 17% of the United States' gross domestic product, with inpatient hospital care estimated to account for up to one-third of spending. The costs of critical illness on the healthcare system are substantial, with annual costs of critical care medicine increasing 92% between 2000 and 2010, from U.S. dollars (U.S.$) 56.6 billion to U.S.$108 billion. Thus, cost-effectiveness is key component of the evaluation of therapeutic interventions.

Early mobilization

Research question Does early mobilization of critically ill patients reduce the incidence or duration of PICS?

Recommendation 1 Early mobilization ought to be started within the first few days in the ICU, depending on the patient's resilience and general condition.

Therapy Option 1: Supplemental use of ergometers (bed cycling) in addition to early mobilization can be considered.

Rationale Mobilization is an energy-consuming process aimed at maintaining and promoting a person's mobility. Early mobilization is started within 72 h after admission and intensified during the stay in ICU. Various methods of early mobilization can be performed with different approaches, including passive mobilization (bed mobility, neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)), assisted exercises (bed cycling, robotics, functional exercises, resistance exercises, transfers), active exercises (active exercises, activities of daily living, walking), or other exercises, e.g. cognitive exercises. Early mobilization is generally recommended during the stay on ICU, as it can have positive effects on the duration of ventilation and length of stay, delirium incidence, and muscle strength at the time of discharge. Although early mobilization in the ICU does not seem to have a significant effect on long-term physical, functional, cognitive, or psychosocial outcome compared to usual care, short-term effects such as reduction of mechanical ventilation and length of stay or delirium frequency in the ICU can be demonstrated. These issues are highly relevant for patients and families. Therefore, we recommend structured, interprofessional implementation of early mobilization of critically ill patients according to defined inclusion and exclusion criteria with the best possible dosage and frequency.

### Early mobilization and recovery in mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU: a bi-national, multi-centre, prospective cohort study [^1141zXZc]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The aim of this study was to investigate current mobilization practice, strength at ICU discharge and functional recovery at 6 months among mechanically ventilated ICU patients.

Method

This was a prospective, multi-centre, cohort study conducted in twelve ICUs in Australia and New Zealand. Patients were previously functionally independent and expected to be ventilated for > 48 hours. We measured mobilization during invasive ventilation, sedation depth using the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS), co-interventions, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW) at ICU discharge, mortality at day 90, and 6-month functional recovery including return to work.

Results

We studied 192 patients (mean age 58.1 ± 15.8 years; mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) (IQR) II score, 18.0 (14 to 24)). Mortality at day 90 was 26.6% (51/192). Over 1,351 study days, we collected information during 1,288 planned early mobilization episodes in patients on mechanical ventilation for the first 14 days or until extubation (whichever occurred first). We recorded the highest level of early mobilization. Despite the presence of dedicated physical therapy staff, no mobilization occurred in 1,079 (84%) of these episodes. Where mobilization occurred, the maximum levels of mobilization were exercises in bed (N = 94, 7%), standing at the bed side (N = 11, 0.9%) or walking (N = 26, 2%). On day three, all patients who were mobilized were mechanically ventilated via an endotracheal tube (N = 10), whereas by day five 50% of the patients mobilized were mechanically ventilated via a tracheostomy tube (N = 18).

Conclusions

Early mobilization of patients receiving mechanical ventilation was uncommon. More than 50% of patients discharged from the ICU had developed ICU-acquired weakness, which was associated with death between ICU discharge and day-90.

### Association of active mobilisation variables with adverse events and mortality in patients requiring mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Ln5hN]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Background

Mobilisation during critical illness is now included in multiple clinical practice guidelines. However, a large, randomised trial and systematic review have recently identified an increased probability of adverse events and mortality in patients who received early active mobilisation in the intensive care unit (ICU). We aimed to determine the effects of mobilisation compared with usual care on adverse events and mortality in an acute ICU setting. In subgroup analyses, we specifically aimed to investigate possible sources of harm, including the timing and duration of mobilisation achieved, ventilation status, and admission diagnosis.

Methods

In this systematic review with frequentist and Bayesian analyses, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and PEDro electronic databases, as well as clinical trial registries (ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov), from inception to March 16, 2023, without language restrictions. Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials that examined active mobilisation compared with either no mobilisation or mobilisation commencing later, or at a lower frequency or intensity, in adults who were critically ill during or after a period of mechanical ventilation in an acute ICU setting. Two authors independently screened reports, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (version 1). The primary outcome was the number of adverse events that occurred during the implementation of mobilisation, with the effect of mobilisation on mortality being the secondary outcome. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs were calculated in R (version 4.0.3) using random-effects modelling, with Bayesian analysis completed to calculate the probability of treatment harm (ie, RR > 1). Subgroup analyses were completed to investigate the association of various factors of mobilisation on adverse events and mortality: duration of mobilisation (longer [≥ 20 min per day] vs shorter [< 20 min per day]), timing of commencement (early [≤ 72 h from ICU admission] vs late [> 72 h from ICU admission]), ventilation status at commencement (all patients mechanically ventilated vs all patients extubated), and ICU admission diagnosis (surgical vs medical). This study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022369272.

Findings

After title and abstract screening of 14440 studies and review of 466 full texts, 67 trials with 7004 participants met inclusion criteria, with 59 trials contributing to the meta-analysis. Of the 67 included studies, 15 (22%) did not mention adverse events and 13 (19%) reported no adverse events occurring across the trial period. Overall, we found no effect of mobilisation compared with usual care on the occurrence of adverse events (RR 1.09 [95% CI 0.69–1.74], p = 0.71; I 2 91%; 32731 events, 20 studies; very low certainty), with a 2.96% occurrence rate (693 events in 23395 intervention sessions; 25 studies). Mobilisation did not have any effect on mortality (RR 0.98 [95% CI 0.87–1.12], p = 0.81; I 2 0%; n = 6218, 58 studies; moderate certainty). Subgroup analysis was hindered by the large amount of data that could not be allocated and analysed, making the results hypothesis generating only.

Interpretation

Implementation of mobilisation in the ICU was associated with a less than 3% chance of an adverse event occurring and was not found to increase adverse events or mortality overall, providing reassurance for clinicians about the safety of performing this intervention. Subgroup analyses did not clearly identify any specific variable of mobilisation implementation that increased harm.

### Association of early mobility with the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis and mortality among critically ill patients: a post hoc analysis of PREVENT trial [^111PvXgT]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Several studies have shown that mobility in critically ill patients was associated with better clinical outcomes, including lower rates of deep-vein thrombosis, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and pressure injury, increased muscle strength and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU and hospital stay. In a pre-post quasi-experimental study in trauma patients (1,044 patients in the pre- and 1,132 patients in the post-intervention cohort), an early mobility program was associated with lower rate of deep-vein thrombosis (6.7% versus 10.9%, p < 0.01; adjusted relative risk 0.67, 95% CI 0.50, 0.90). Another pre-post quasi-experimental study evaluated a structured progressive mobility protocol in trauma and burns patients (184 patients in the pre- and 159 patients in post-intervention cohort) observed lower rate VTE in postintervention cohort (7.5% versus 21%, p = 0.0004). A systemic review and meta-analysis also showed that mobility reduced the risk of deep-vein thrombosis (risk ratio 0.16; 95% CI 0.06, 0.47). This was based on 7 randomized controlled trials, mostly with small sample sizes (total of 730 patients) and significant biases. Additionally, the studies used different definitions of mobility. In the current study, we found that higher early mobility levels were associated with similar incident lower-limb deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism compared with lower mobility level (range of motion) in patients expected to stay > 72 h in the ICU. As all study patients were on pharmacologic prophylaxis by study design, it is possible that early mobility has little impact on VTE prevention in such a setting, especially that mobilization was probably relatively short in duration for each session relative to the rest of the time during the day spent in the ICU. We also found that higher mobility levels were associated with lower mortality and less organ support. A meta-analysis of randomized and controlled trials found that mobility had no impact on short- and long-term mortality in ICU patients but led to more days alive and out of hospital to day 180. More recently, The Treatment of Mechanically Ventilated Adults with Early Activity and Mobilization (TEAM) trial randomized 750 adult patients on mechanical ventilation and found that an increase in early active mobilization (sedation minimization and daily physiotherapy) did not result in a significantly greater number of days alive and out of hospital compared with the usual level of mobilization in the ICU. In this trial, both groups received active physiotherapy; the number of days per patient when physiotherapy assessment occurred was 0.94 ± 0.11 in the early active mobilization group and 0.81 ± 0.24 in the usual care group. The limited separation in treatment exposure between the two groups and the active mobility program in the control arm, which do not reflect mobility practices in most ICUs, keep this question open.

### Expert consensus and recommendations on safety criteria for active mobilization of mechanically ventilated critically ill adults [^1177rXS1]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Nature of the safety recommendations

The consensus group agreed that the recommendations were aimed at assisting in the assessment of adult, mechanically ventilated ICU patients to determine if and when mobilization could commence. A critical element that was adopted was that these criteria should be regarded as a guide and should always be used in conjunction with clinical reasoning. It was agreed that the input into the decision to mobilize should lie with all members of the multidisciplinary team (that is, physiotherapy, medical, nursing staff) with the treating clinician having ultimate responsibility for decision making.

The safety criteria developed by the group are intended to be used whenever mobilization is considered, which might be up to several times per day for an individual patient. The consensus group agreed that a standard traffic-light system of recommendations would be used to assist clinicians in evaluating safety criteria, where red would indicate the need for caution as the risk of an adverse event, or consequences of an adverse event, was high, yellow would indicate that mobilization was possible, but only after further consideration and/or further discussion among the ICU multidisciplinary team, and green would indicate that the patient was safe to be mobilized (see Figure 1). It was agreed that the most conservatively scored parameter must take precedence over all other scores (for example, a single red would be sufficient to caution about the potential for high risk of an adverse event during mobilization, even if all other parameters were green). In considering the decision to mobilize a patient, the criteria should be assessed on the status of the patient at the time of planned mobilization, but changes in condition, and direction of trends, in the preceding hours should also be taken into account. The potential consequences of an adverse event in an individual patient should also be considered as part of the overall clinical reasoning process.

### Expert consensus and recommendations on safety criteria for active mobilization of mechanically ventilated critically ill adults [^115RXECf]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The aim of this study was to develop consensus recommendations on safety criteria to determine readiness for actively mobilizing adult, mechanically ventilated, ICU patients. Utilizing previous evidence and expert opinion, the consensus group achieved consensus for most of the respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological and other safety considerations.

The criteria that have been used to determine when critically ill patients can be mobilized have varied between studies. Criteria for the early mobilization of adult ICU patients were published by Stiller and Phillips in 2004, primarily based on physiological principles and their clinical experience, and were later endorsed by Gosselink et al. for the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. However, the level of evidence supporting these recommendations is limited. Compared to previous studies that have outlined safety parameters for the early mobilization of ICU patients, the recommendations outlined in this paper appear to be less conservative and more comprehensive by covering a wider array of clinical scenarios. The recommendations and clinical scenarios were identified by the group in an attempt to maximize mobilization of ICU patients. We believe these recommendations will assist in standardizing safety precautions regarding mobilization in ICUs across different healthcare centers and are appropriate for use by experienced ICU clinicians. However, each ICU should consider the recommendations in light of their own staffing levels and expertise. In the current study, panel members were unable to reach consensus for some safety considerations, specifically, the level of vasoactive drugs as noted earlier. Clearly, there is a need for research in this area to clarify safety parameters.

### Early intervention (mobilization or active exercise) for critically ill adults in the intensive care unit [^114s7TVm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Survivors of critical illness often experience a multitude of problems that begin in the intensive care unit (ICU) or present and continue after discharge. These can include muscle weakness, cognitive impairments, psychological difficulties, reduced physical function such as in activities of daily living (ADLs), and decreased quality of life. Early interventions such as mobilizations or active exercise, or both, may diminish the impact of the sequelae of critical illness.

Objectives

To assess the effects of early intervention (mobilization or active exercise), commenced in the ICU, provided to critically ill adults either during or after the mechanical ventilation period, compared with delayed exercise or usual care, on improving physical function or performance, muscle strength and health-related quality of life.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL. We searched conference proceedings, reference lists of retrieved articles, databases of trial registries and contacted experts in the field on 31 August 2017. We did not impose restrictions on language or location of publications.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that compared early intervention (mobilization or active exercise, or both), delivered in the ICU, with delayed exercise or usual care delivered to critically ill adults either during or after the mechanical ventilation period in the ICU.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two researchers independently screened titles and abstracts and assessed full-text articles against the inclusion criteria of this review. We resolved any disagreement through discussion with a third review author as required. We presented data descriptively using mean differences or medians, risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals. A meta-analysis was not possible due to the heterogeneity of the included studies. We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE.

Main Results

We included four RCTs (a total of 690 participants), in this review. Participants were adults who were mechanically ventilated in a general, medical or surgical ICU, with mean or median age in the studies ranging from 56 to 62 years. Admitting diagnoses in three of the four studies were indicative of critical illness, while participants in the fourth study had undergone cardiac surgery. Three studies included range-of-motion exercises, bed mobility activities, transfers and ambulation. The fourth study involved only upper limb exercises. Included studies were at high risk of performance bias, as they were not blinded to participants and personnel, and two of four did not blind outcome assessors. Three of four studies reported only on those participants who completed the study, with high rates of dropout. The description of intervention type, dose, intensity and frequency in the standard care control group was poor in two of four studies. Three studies (a total of 454 participants) reported at least one measure of physical function. One study (104 participants) reported low-quality evidence of beneficial effects in the intervention group on return to independent functional status at hospital discharge (59% versus 35%, risk ratio (RR) 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11 to 2.64); the absolute effect is that 246 more people (95% CI 38 to 567) per 1000 would attain independent functional status when provided with early mobilization. The effects on physical functioning are uncertain for a range measures: Barthel Index scores (early mobilization: median 75 control: versus 55, low quality evidence), number of ADLs achieved at ICU (median of 3 versus 0, low quality evidence) or at hospital discharge (median of 6 versus 4, low quality evidence). The effects of early mobilization on physical function measured at ICU discharge are uncertain, as measured by the Acute Care Index of Function (ACIF) (early mobilization mean: 61.1 versus control: 55, mean difference (MD) 6.10, 95% CI -11.85 to 24.05, low quality evidence) and the Physical Function ICU Test (PFIT) score (5.6 versus 5.4, MD 0.20, 95% CI -0.98 to 1.38, low quality evidence). There is low quality evidence that early mobilization may have little or no effect on physical function measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery score at ICU discharge from one study of 184 participants (mean 1.6 in the intervention group versus 1.9 in usual care, MD -0.30, 95% CI -1.10 to 0.50), or at hospital discharge (MD 0, 95% CI -1.00 to 0.90). The fourth study, which examined postoperative cardiac surgery patients did not measure physical function as an outcome. Adverse effects were reported across the four studies but we could not combine the data. Our certainty in the risk of adverse events with either mobilization strategy is low due to the low rate of events. One study reported that in the intervention group one out of 49 participants (2%) experienced oxygen desaturation less than 80% and one of 49 (2%) had accidental dislodgement of the radial catheter. This study also found cessation of therapy due to participant instability occurred in 19 of 498 (4%) of the intervention sessions. In another study five of 101 (5%) participants in the intervention group and five of 109 (4.6%) participants in the control group had postoperative pulmonary complications deemed to be unrelated to intervention. A third study found one of 150 participants in the intervention group had an episode of asymptomatic bradycardia, but completed the exercise session. The fourth study reported no adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence on the effect of early mobilization of critically ill people in the ICU on physical function or performance, adverse events, muscle strength and health-related quality of life at this time. The four studies awaiting classification, and the three ongoing studies may alter the conclusions of the review once these results are available. We assessed that there is currently low-quality evidence for the effect of early mobilization of critically ill adults in the ICU due to small sample sizes, lack of blinding of participants and personnel, variation in the interventions and outcomes used to measure their effect and inadequate descriptions of the interventions delivered as usual care in the studies included in this Cochrane Review.

### Early active mobilization during mechanical ventilation in the ICU [^113RbMsm]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired weakness often develops in patients who are undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. Early active mobilization may mitigate ICU-acquired weakness, increase survival, and reduce disability.

Methods

We randomly assigned 750 adult patients in the ICU who were undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation to receive increased early mobilization (sedation minimization and daily physiotherapy) or usual care (the level of mobilization that was normally provided in each ICU). The primary outcome was the number of days that the patients were alive and out of the hospital at 180 days after randomization.

Results

The median number of days that patients were alive and out of the hospital was 143 (interquartile range, 21 to 161) in the early-mobilization group and 145 days (interquartile range, 51 to 164) in the usual-care group (absolute difference, -2.0 days; 95% confidence interval [CI] -10 to 6; P = 0.62). The mean (± SD) daily duration of active mobilization was 20.8 ± 14.6 minutes and 8.8 ± 9.0 minutes in the two groups, respectively (difference, 12.0 minutes per day; 95% CI, 10.4 to 13.6). A total of 77% of the patients in both groups were able to stand by a median interval of 3 days and 5 days, respectively (difference, -2 days; 95% CI, -3.4 to -0.6). By day 180, death had occurred in 22.5% of the patients in the early-mobilization group and in 19.5% of those in the usual-care group (odds ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.65). Among survivors, quality of life, activities of daily living, disability, cognitive function, and psychological function were similar in the two groups. Serious adverse events were reported in 7 patients in the early-mobilization group and in 1 patient in the usual-care group. Adverse events that were potentially due to mobilization (arrhythmias, altered blood pressure, and desaturation) were reported in 34 of 371 patients (9.2%) in the early-mobilization group and in 15 of 370 patients (4.1%) in the usual-care group (P = 0.005).

Conclusions

Among adults undergoing mechanical ventilation in the ICU, an increase in early active mobilization did not result in a significantly greater number of days that patients were alive and out of the hospital than did the usual level of mobilization in the ICU. The intervention was associated with increased adverse events.

### Ten strategies to optimize early mobilization and rehabilitation in intensive care [^115Az21V]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Understand patient preferences

ICU patients' experience with early mobilization and rehabilitation is variable. It may be tiring, uncomfortable and difficult, while at other times be motivating and rewarding for patients. With improving cognitive status, patients may be shocked by the severity of their muscle weakness. In the early stages of critical illness, patients may prefer to focus on short-time goals (e.g. sitting in a chair) set by the multidisciplinary team. As patients progress, they may become more engaged in goal setting and longer-term rehabilitation planning (e.g. walking longer distances, sitting outside) (Fig. 1).

### The cost-effectiveness of early active mobilization during mechanical ventilation in the ICU: an economic evaluation alongside the treatment of mechanically ventilated adults with early activity and mobilization (TEAM) trial [^112vjhHz]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Summary of Findings

This economic evaluation of the TEAM RCT did not find evidence that higher-dose early active mobilization is a cost-effective intervention compared with usual care mobilization for patients who are mechanically ventilated in ICU. However, there was a high degree of uncertainty around the results. Early active mobilization resulted in higher costs and produced less QALYs than usual care mobilization, although the differences were not statistically significant. The INMB was negative, indicating that higher-dose early active mobilization is not a cost-effective intervention at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY, although the CI included both negative and positive values. However, a sensitivity analysis applying results from a meta-analysis of early active mobilization to the usual care mobilization group in the TEAM study indicated that early active mobilization is cost-effective, although this resulted from reduced costs and poorer outcomes. Finally, we found some heterogeneity in costs between geographical regions and minimal heterogeneity in QALYs.

Comparison to Previous Research

Early active mobilization is a key component of recommended bundles of care in the ICU and clinical practice guidelines globally. Despite this, there have been no economic evaluations alongside RCTs of early active mobilization in ICU patients. A retrospective, single-center U.S. study found no difference despite shorter hospital stays. A retrospective preintervention and postintervention quality comparison study in 391 ICU patients found a reduction in total hospital costs after the introduction of a progressive early mobilization program. However, economic evaluations or costing studies using data from nonrandomized trials can result in an over-representation of the cost-effectiveness of an intervention. Economic evaluations of early active mobilization in other clinical areas have concurred with our results — an economic evaluation alongside the phase III A Very Early Rehabilitation Trial after stroke (AVERT) RCT of very early mobilization after stroke found that very early mobilization was unlikely to be cost-effective compared with usual care mobilization.

### The cost-effectiveness of early active mobilization during mechanical ventilation in the ICU: an economic evaluation alongside the treatment of mechanically ventilated adults with early activity and mobilization (TEAM) trial [^113qMs9t]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

ICU-acquired weakness is common in mechanically ventilated patients and is associated with prolonged hospitalization, increased mortality, poor quality of life in survivors, and increased ICU and hospitalization costs. Early active mobilization may reduce ICU-acquired weakness and improve patient function. The Treatment of Mechanically Ventilated Adults With Early Activity and Mobilization (TEAM) randomized controlled trial (RCT) was an international, multicenter trial that compared a higher dose of early active mobilization to usual care mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients. The trial found no difference in the primary outcome of days alive and out of hospital to day 180; however, it did find an increase in adverse events in the intervention group.

In contrast to the above findings, early mobilization is recommended by the Society of Critical Care Medicine ICU Liberation Bundle. Furthermore, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis identified 15 RCTs of early active mobilization and found a 75.1% probability that early active mobilization increases days alive and out of hospital and a 95.1% probability that it improves patient-reported physical function at 6 months. However, none of the included RCTs reported costs or had an associated economic evaluation. While there was no difference in the primary outcome of the TEAM trial, small, nonsignificant differences in numerous parameters in a trial can result in cost estimates that are unexpected compared with looking at individual parameters alone. Accordingly, we aimed to assess quality of life and resource use from the perspective of healthcare payers over the 6 months in the TEAM trial and estimate the cost-effectiveness of a higher dose of early active mobilization.

### To mobilise or not to mobilise: is that the right question? [^116v3HNn]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Early mobilisation is defined by an exercise intervention based on a reproducible and physiological approach. The aim is to deliver early mobilisation as soon as it is safe to do so, when patients are physiologically stable. There are several difficulties with interpreting the evidence for early mobilisation:

(1) There is no clear definition of "early". Some randomised-controlled trials have defined early mobilisation as mobilisation that commenced within 2 days of invasive mechanical ventilation, whilst others have defined it as within 5 days of admission to ICU or any time in ICU (Table 1). In the largest randomised controlled trial (RCT) to date of early mobilisation published in 2022 (N = 750), the mean duration of time from ICU admission to randomisation was 2.5 days and assessment for early active mobilisation occurred on the day of randomisation in 86% of the intervention group. This study did not measure or include passive mobilisation which may have started earlier. However, in the recent study published by Patel and colleagues in 2023 (N = 200), early mobilisation (passive or active) occurred within 1.1 days

(2) The definition and dose of "mobilisation" may be different amongst trials, for example, starting with passive exercies versus active exercises, varied use of equipment such as cycle ergometers, tilt tables or electrical muscle stimulation, or any combinations of exercise and equipment. Evidence synthesis suggests that functional exercises, such as standing, sitting, and walking, may be the most effective.

(3) There may be a heterogeneity of treatment effect with early mobilisation where some patients respond better than others.

International clinical practice is varied. Pragmatic trials that have used "usual care" as the comparator to the intervention group may differ between trials (Table 1). Usual care comprises over half of control groups in ICU rehabilitation trials, with varied terminology, such as usual care, standard care, conventional care, and routine care. For clinicians considering the applicability of trial results in their clinical context, it is crucial to carefully review the description of both the intervention and the control groups of the study, and compare it to their own practice (Table 1). It is clear that some trials have included a usual care arm that includes minimal mobilisation in ICU, whilst other trials have included a usual care arm that includes a substantial amount of mobilisation consistent with standard practice in their ICU.

### Ten strategies to optimize early mobilization and rehabilitation in intensive care [^117KGSUY]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the last decade, there have been more than 40 randomized trials evaluating early mobilization and rehabilitation in intensive care units (ICU). Such trials generally aim to reduce the incidence of ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW) which is associated with poor long-term survival, physical functioning, and quality of life. At least eight international guidelines have recommended ICU early mobilization and rehabilitation.

Despite supporting evidence and guidelines, implementation of ICU mobilization and rehabilitation is highly variable. Hence, we report on 10 steps to help ICU clinicians in optimizing early mobilization and rehabilitation.

### Effects of robotic-assisted early mobilization versus conventional mobilization in intensive care unit patients: prospective interventional cohort study with retrospective control group analysis [^11616Zjh]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately one in three survivors of critical illness suffers from intensive-care-unit-acquired weakness, which increases mortality and impairs quality of life. By counteracting immobilization, a known risk factor, active mobilization may mitigate its negative effects on patients. In this single-center trial, the effect of robotic-assisted early mobilization in the intensive care unit (ICU) on patients' outcomes was investigated.

Methods

We enrolled 16 adults scheduled for lung transplantation to receive 20 min of robotic-assisted mobilization and verticalization twice daily during their first week in the ICU (intervention group: IG). A control group (CG) of 13 conventionally mobilized patients after lung transplantation was recruited retrospectively. Outcome measures included the duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, muscle parameters evaluated by ultrasound, and quality of life after three months.

Results

During the first week in the ICU, the intervention group received a median of 6 (interquartile range 3–8) robotic-assisted sessions of early mobilization and verticalization. There were no statistically significant differences in the duration of mechanical ventilation (IG: median 126 vs. CG: 78 h), length of ICU stay, muscle parameters evaluated by ultrasound, and quality of life after three months between the IG and CG.

Conclusion

In this study, robotic-assisted mobilization was successfully implemented in the ICU setting. No significant differences in patients' outcomes were observed between conventional and robotic-assisted mobilization. However, randomized and larger studies are necessary to validate the adequacy of robotic mobilization in other cohorts.

### Systematic early versus late mobilization or standard early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ujF8A]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the effectiveness of systematic early mobilization in improving muscle strength and physical function in mechanically ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients.

Methods

We conducted a two-stage systematic literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library until January 2019 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effects of early mobilization initiated within 7 days after ICU admission compared with late mobilization, standard early mobilization or no mobilization. Priority outcomes were Medical Research Council Sum Score (MRC-SS), incidence of ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW), 6-min walk test (6MWT), proportion of patients reaching independence, time needed until walking, SF-36 Physical Function Domain Score (PFS) and SF-36 Physical Health Component Score (PCS). Meta-analysis was conducted where sufficient comparable evidence was available. We evaluated the certainty of evidence according to the GRADE approach.

Results

We identified 12 eligible RCTs contributing data from 1304 participants. Two RCTs were categorized as comparing systematic early with late mobilization, nine with standard early mobilization and one with no mobilization. We found evidence for a benefit of systematic early mobilization compared to late mobilization for SF-36 PFS (MD 12.3; 95% CI 3.9–20.8) and PCS (MD 3.4; 95% CI 0.01–6.8), as well as on the proportion of patients reaching independence and the time needed to walking, but not for incidence of ICUAW (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.38–1.03) or MRC-SS. For systematic early compared to standard early mobilization, we found no statistically significant benefit on MRC-SS (MD 5.8; 95% CI − 1.4 to 13.0), incidence of ICUAW (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.63–1.27), SF-36 PFS (MD 8.1; 95% CI − 15.3 to 31.4) or PCS (MD − 2.4; 95% CI − 6.1 to 1.3) or other priority outcomes except for change in 6MWT from baseline. Generally, effects appeared stronger for systematic early compared to late mobilization than to standard early mobilization. We judged the certainty of evidence for all outcomes as very low to low.

Conclusion

The evidence regarding a benefit of systematic early mobilization remained inconclusive. However, our findings indicate that the larger the difference in the timing between the intervention and the comparator, the more likely an RCT is to find a benefit for early mobilization.

### Clinical practice guideline: early mobilization and rehabilitation of critically ill burn patients [^113CfRTU]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2023). High credibility.

Early mobilization and rehabilitation (EMR) in non-burn ICU patients — mechanical ventilation outcomes are mixed and heterogeneous; a systematic review "was unable to perform a meta-analysis on the outcome of MV duration because much of the data were significantly skewed", and "there was considerable heterogeneity between these studies with respect to the comparisons made". Trial-level findings vary: "Individually, the vast majority of RCTs have demonstrated that an early physical therapy intervention produced a significant reduction in the duration of MV or improvement (increase) in ventilator-free days", yet "a small number of RCTs have shown no effect of early rehabilitation and mobilization on time spent on a ventilator", leading to the conclusion that "In summary, there is uncertainty about the effect of an early physiotherapy intervention on the duration of MV in non-burn ICU patients".

### Implementing early mobilization interventions in mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU [^1117DEZy]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

As ICU survival continues to improve, clinicians are faced with short- and long-term consequences of critical illness. Deconditioning and weakness have become common problems in survivors of critical illness requiring mechanical ventilation. Recent literature, mostly from a medical population of patients in the ICU, has challenged the patient care model of prolonged bed rest. Instead, the feasibility, safety, and benefits of early mobilization of mechanically ventilated ICU patients have been reported in recent publications. The benefits of early mobilization include reductions in length of stay in the ICU and hospital as well as improvements in strength and functional status. Such benefits can be accomplished with a remarkably acceptable patient safety profile. The importance of interactions between mind and body are highlighted by these studies, with improvements in patient awareness and reductions in ICU delirium being noted. Future research to address the benefits of early mobilization in other patient populations is needed. In addition, the potential for early mobilization to impact long-term outcomes in ICU survivors requires further study.

### Clinical review: early patient mobilization in the ICU [^111VAKmx]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Early mobilization (EM) of ICU patients is a physiologically logical intervention to attenuate critical illness-associated muscle weakness. However, its long-term value remains controversial. We performed a detailed analytical review of the literature using multiple relevant key terms in order to provide a comprehensive assessment of current knowledge on EM in critically ill patients. We found that the term EM remains undefined and encompasses a range of heterogeneous interventions that have been used alone or in combination. Nonetheless, several studies suggest that different forms of EM may be both safe and feasible in ICU patients, including those receiving mechanical ventilation. Unfortunately, these studies of EM are mostly single center in design, have limited external validity and have highly variable control treatments. In addition, new technology to facilitate EM such as cycle ergometry, transcutaneous electrical muscle stimulation and video therapy are increasingly being used to achieve such EM despite limited evidence of efficacy. We conclude that although preliminary low-level evidence suggests that EM in the ICU is safe, feasible and may yield clinical benefits, EM is also labor-intensive and requires appropriate staffing models and equipment. More research is thus required to identify current standard practice, optimal EM techniques and appropriate outcome measures before EM can be introduced into the routine care of critically ill patients.

### The feasibility of early physical activity in intensive care unit patients: a prospective observational one-center study [^116k5zw3]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Prolonged immobilization may harm intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and early mobilization has been proposed to counteract that process. We describe our experience in early rehabilitation of ICU patients, and its effects on physiologic outcomes.

Methods

We included all patients who stayed in our 14-bed medical ICU for ≥ 7 days and received invasive mechanical ventilation for ≥ 2 days. The rehabilitation program included chair-sitting, tilting-up (with arms supported or unsupported), and walking. We collected vital signs before and after each intervention.

Results

Over a 5-month period we studied 20 patients, after a median ICU stay of 5 days. A contraindication to the intervention was present on 230 days (43%). Sedation (15%), shock (11%), and renal support (9%) were the most frequent contraindications. We obtained complete data from 275 of 424 interventions, 33% of which were performed during mechanical ventilation. The chair-sitting intervention was the most frequent (56%), followed by the tilting-up-with-arms-unsupported intervention (25%), the walking intervention (11%), and the tilting-up arms-supported intervention (8%). The chair-sitting intervention was associated with a significant (P = 0.03) decline in both heart rate (mean -3.5 beats/min, 95% confidence interval [CI] -6.5 to -0.4 beats/min) and respiratory rate (-1.4 breaths/min, 95% CI -2.6 to 0.1 breaths/min), whereas blood oxygen saturation (measured via pulse oximetry [S(pO(2))]) and mean arterial blood pressure did not change significantly. Heart rate and respiratory rate similarly increased with tilting-up: 14.6 beats/min, 95% CI 10.8 to 18.4 beats/min, and 5.5 breaths/min, 95% CI 3.6 to 7.3 breaths/min with arms unsupported, and 12.4 beats/min, 95% CI 7.0 to 17.9 beats/min and 2.6 breaths/min, 95% CI -0.4 to 5.7 breaths/min with arms supported). Heart rate and respiratory rate also increased with the walking intervention: 6.9 beats/min, 95% CI 2.6 to 11.1 beats/min, and 5.9 breaths/min, 95% CI 3.8 to 8.0 breaths/min. The walking intervention significantly decreased S(pO(2)). An adverse event occurred in 13 (3%) of 424 interventions, but none had harmful consequences.

Conclusions

Early rehabilitation is feasible and safe in patients in the ICU for longer than 1 week. The chair-sitting intervention was associated with nonsignificant oxygenation improvement. The tilting-up intervention was an effort as intense as walking.

### A team approach to the introduction of safe early mobilisation in an adult critical care unit [^111EjdGo]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

A systematic review of active mobilisation of patients who were ventilated for more than 24 hours found that active mobilisation may improve muscle strength, functional independence, weaning from the ventilator, and reduce hospital length of stay. No serious adverse events were reported in the studies reviewed. A more recent systematic review which included studies of active therapies including sitting at the edge of the bed, and active exercises, hoisting to a chair, standing and walking, found that active mobilisation led to better muscle strength at ICU discharge, greater probability of walking without assistance at hospital discharge, and more days alive and out of hospital at 180 days. It found no difference in ICU or hospital length of stay, quality of life, or duration of mechanical ventilation. A randomised control trial of goal-directed mobilisation examined the effect of graded mobilisation in ICU patients. Patients who were functionally independent prior to ICU admission, and who were ventilated for less than 48 hours during their ICU stay, were mobilised according to goals set on ward rounds, either no mobilisation, passive movements, sitting, standing or walking. Interprofessional planning and working was assured by a facilitator who ensured the delivery of the mobilisation protocol. The intervention led to higher mobilisation scores, shorter length of stay and greater functional mobility at hospital discharge. A pilot study randomised patients expected to be ventilated for more than 48 hours to usual physiotherapy or early goal-directed mobilisation. This was a protocolised graded intervention consisting of 30–60 min of activity consisting of sitting in bed, sitting at the edge of the bed, sitting in a chair, standing or walking, depending on the mobility assessed by a scoring system. The study found that this approach was feasible and safe, and improved mobilisation rates with double the proportion of patients in the intervention group walking. Although not powered to look at other outcomes, there was no difference in ICU or hospital length of stay or duration of ventilation.

### Systematic early versus late mobilization or standard early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111TFnSP]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Results in context

Several systematic reviews have addressed early mobilization in recent years. Conclusions drawn by these reviews differ as to whether or not the evidence is sufficiently strong to conclude that early mobilization provides a benefit on muscle strength, physical function, quality of life, mortality, length of stay and other outcomes. While Doiron et al. and Castro-Avila et al. reported no statistically significant effects on outcomes related to muscle strength and physical function, Fuke et al. Okada et al. and Zang et al. found a statistically significant benefit with early mobilization. This discrepancy primarily stems from slight differences in the inclusion of RCTs. Our review excluded some studies that were included in other reviews due to ineligibility of the study population or late initiation of the mobilization intervention. Conversely, we included the recent study by Eggmann et al. which found no evidence for a benefit comparing early mobilization with standard care with a very small timing difference between groups (median 47 vs. 52 h). This may explain why our review did not find sufficient evidence to conclude an effect of early mobilization on muscle strength or physical function outcomes.

As discussed by other authors, the definition of 'early mobilization' varies strongly across studies. While there is no uniform consensus, the field appears to increasingly define early mobilization as starting within 72 h of ICU admission. Ding et al. attempted to identify the optimal starting time for early mobilization in a network meta-analysis of 15 RCTs, from which they concluded that initiation of mobilization within 72–96 h of mechanical ventilation would be most beneficial for the improvement of ICUAW. Unfortunately, their analysis did not account for timing differences between intervention and comparator groups.

However, the difference in timing between intervention and comparator group may be an important determinant for identifying a benefit of systematic early mobilization in studies. Our findings suggest that systematic early mobilization may be effective when compared to late mobilization, but there was insufficient evidence for a benefit of systematic early mobilization compared to standard early mobilization. Thus, the difference in timing between intervention and comparator groups may be at least as important as the absolute timing of the first mobilization in the intervention group. We consider the separate analysis of different comparator categories a unique strength of our systematic review, as this contrast sheds light on an important issue when interpreting the available evidence on early mobilization. Treatment recommendations on early mobilization need to consider comparator group interventions in trials to judge whether more systematic or earlier mobilization approaches may provide additional clinical benefits over standard care and are cost-effective in the respective context.

### The cost-effectiveness of early active mobilization during mechanical ventilation in the ICU: an economic evaluation alongside the treatment of mechanically ventilated adults with early activity and mobilization (TEAM) trial [^114w6sHU]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The current economic evaluation found that, using the individual patient data from the TEAM trial, higher-dose early active mobilization is not a cost-effective intervention compared with usual care mobilization for mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients, and the probability that it is a cost-effective intervention compared with usual care is less than 50%. However, results from sensitivity analyses indicate that early active mobilization may be cost-effective if one is willing to accept poorer outcomes to reduce costs. Further research is necessary to determine whether there are scenarios in which early active mobilization provides value for money.

### Clinical practice guideline: early mobilization and rehabilitation of critically ill burn patients [^111ti4HQ]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2023). High credibility.

Early mobilization and rehabilitation of critically ill burn patients — critically ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients are subjected to prolonged bedrest and immobilization, with deconditioning and progressive weakness of skeletal and respiratory muscles during controlled mechanical ventilation (MV); delirium and ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW) can develop and persist, and many survivors lack normal physical function even as late as 5 years after ICU discharge. In non-burn ICU populations, several systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have been conducted; while some concluded that early mobilization lessened ICU-acquired muscle weakness, improved measures of physical function, shortened the duration of MV, and improved health-related quality of life following hospital discharge, other reviews were inconclusive or found no consistent effect, and some identified high risk of bias and low overall confidence in the literature. Early mobilization in the ICU is generally considered to be safe and feasible, although one systematic review reported low certainty in the scientific evidence on the risk of adverse events. Prolonged bedrest, ICUAW, prolonged ventilatory support, and PICS are anticipated to be especially problematic among burn patients in the ICU; although post-discharge exercise rehabilitation has shown benefits in severely burned patients, relatively little is known about initiating active exercise during the burn ICU stay, and many centers use heterogeneous approaches without standardized guidelines. Methods for this guideline included virtual meetings and electronic communication by the committee, which identified clinically important questions by discussion and consensus and designed them using a PICO approach.

### Early physical and occupational therapy in mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients: a randomised controlled trial [^112eDj7w]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Long-term complications of critical illness include intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired weakness and neuropsychiatric disease. Immobilisation secondary to sedation might potentiate these problems. We assessed the efficacy of combining daily interruption of sedation with physical and occupational therapy on functional outcomes in patients receiving mechanical ventilation in intensive care.

Methods

Sedated adults (≥ 18 years of age) in the ICU who had been on mechanical ventilation for less than 72 h, were expected to continue for at least 24 h, and who met criteria for baseline functional independence were eligible for enrolment in this randomised controlled trial at two university hospitals. We randomly assigned 104 patients by computer-generated, permuted block randomisation to early exercise and mobilisation (physical and occupational therapy) during periods of daily interruption of sedation (intervention; n = 49) or to daily interruption of sedation with therapy as ordered by the primary care team (control; n = 55). The primary endpoint-the number of patients returning to independent functional status at hospital discharge-was defined as the ability to perform six activities of daily living and the ability to walk independently. Therapists who undertook patient assessments were blinded to treatment assignment. Secondary endpoints included duration of delirium and ventilator-free days during the first 28 days of hospital stay. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00322010.

Findings

All 104 patients were included in the analysis. Return to independent functional status at hospital discharge occurred in 29 (59%) patients in the intervention group compared with 19 (35%) patients in the control group (p = 0.02; odds ratio 2.7 [95% CI 1.2–6.1]). Patients in the intervention group had shorter duration of delirium (median 2.0 days, IQR 0.0–6.0 vs 4.0 days, 2.0–8.0; p = 0.02), and more ventilator-free days (23.5 days, 7.4–25.6 vs 21.1 days, 0.0–23.8; p = 0.05) during the 28-day follow-up period than did controls. There was one serious adverse event in 498 therapy sessions (desaturation less than 80%). Discontinuation of therapy as a result of patient instability occurred in 19 (4%) of all sessions, most commonly for perceived patient-ventilator asynchrony.

Interpretation

A strategy for whole-body rehabilitation-consisting of interruption of sedation and physical and occupational therapy in the earliest days of critical illness-was safe and well tolerated, and resulted in better functional outcomes at hospital discharge, a shorter duration of delirium, and more ventilator-free days compared with standard care.

### Clinical trials of early mobilization of critically ill patients [^112yCf2X]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Intensive care unit-acquired weakness is a common complication of critical illness leading to severe functional impairment in many intensive care unit survivors. Critically ill patients who require mechanical ventilation are routinely immobilized for prolonged time periods. This immobilization is exacerbated by frequent administration of sedative agents. Recently, several investigators have described the feasibility and potential benefits of mobilizing mechanically ventilated intensive care unit patients. Such an intervention requires a multidisciplinary team approach to patient care, involving nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and respiratory therapy practitioners. Recent studies of early mobilization of mechanically ventilated intensive care unit patients have noted this intervention to be safe and associated with improved functional outcomes in this extremely ill patient cohort. Such outcomes include high percentages of patients able to ambulate on intensive care unit and hospital discharge and shortened hospital length of stay. With preliminary studies demonstrating remarkable feasibility and successes, further prospective studies of early mobilization are needed to evaluate this intervention.

### Systematic early versus late mobilization or standard early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1169SrUR]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Risk of bias assessment

We assessed the risk of bias of included RCTs using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and evaluated study-level bias as recommended by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). As blinding of personnel is commonly not possible in the context of rehabilitative interventions, this domain was not considered for the study-level assessment.

Data synthesis

We primarily used a narrative synthesis due to the high heterogeneity between RCTs, measured outcomes and follow-up time points. As we considered the comparator interventions to be a major source of heterogeneity, we report results stratified by comparator category (i.e. late mobilization, standard early mobilization or no mobilization). Studies were categorized according to the timing and the nature of the comparator intervention. Studies in which the comparator did not meet the definition of early mobilization were assigned to the late mobilization category. Studies in which the comparator was also administered early, but in a less protocol-driven and consistent manner, according to less strict criteria or not in all eligible patients, were assigned to the standard early mobilization category. Studies that could not be categorized with respect to the timing of the comparator were also assigned to the standard early mobilization category, in order to enable separate evaluation of studies in which a clear timing difference between groups was present (i.e. comparing early with late mobilization). Studies with a sham procedure or no rehabilitative intervention as comparator were assigned to the no mobilization category.

We conducted pairwise fixed- and random-effects meta-analyses for outcomes that were reported by at least three studies. Studies reporting median and interquartile range (IQR) only were not included in the meta-analyses. We report risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. Study heterogeneity was assessed visually using forest plots and statistically using the I 2 -statistic. We further conducted sensitivity analyses to explore heterogeneity. We planned to conduct heterogeneity assessment based on predefined factors (continuation of the intervention post ICU discharge, intervention type, study population characteristics, study-level risk of bias) and to assess small study effects using funnel plots and Egger's test, where appropriate. However, the number of studies for each reported outcome was too low to allow a meaningful assessment. Preplanned subgroup analyses based on age and length of ICU stay were not possible because no separate data were reported for these populations. We used R (version 3.5.2) for all statistical analyses.

Early mobilization during ICU care — acutely hospitalized adults ventilated for more than 24 hours: For acutely hospitalized adults who have been mechanically ventilated for more than 24 hours, we suggest protocolized rehabilitation directed toward early mobilization (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the evidence). Evidence indicated a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and patients more likely to be able to walk at hospital discharge, with no differences in mortality, ICU length of stay, ability to walk at ICU discharge, 6-minute walk distance, or ventilator-free days; low rates of serious adverse events, including arrhythmias, have been reported. There is insufficient evidence to recommend any rehabilitation protocol over another.

### Clustering of critically ill patients using an individualized learning approach enables dose optimization of mobilization in the ICU [^111vawZw]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Early mobilization has been suggested as a promising intervention to counteract intensive care unit acquired weakness (ICUAW) by attenuating the muscle wasting associated with critical illness. Previous clinical studies with an early intervention start have shown, early mobilization can be safely initiated in the ICU and might improve the functional capacity, reduce days with mechanical ventilation in the ICU and increase the rate of discharge home. However, in the recently published TEAM trial increasing active early mobilization did not result in significantly reduced hospital length of stay or mortality compared to usual ICU mobilization. In addition, the rate of adverse events was increased in the intervention group. This raises the question which patients benefit most from early mobilization and how to determine the appropriate type, timing, intensity, coordination and duration of therapy. Wide variability was found in intervention characteristics, outcome measures and associated metrics, leading to conflicting results regarding the influence of early mobilization dosage on functional status after ICU stay. Commonly, only the maximum level of mobilization achieved is quantified, whereas the duration, intensity and frequency as important parameters of the dosage of mobilization are not. Since the group of intensive care patients is extremely heterogeneous, it is difficult to recommend interventions across all patients. The relationship between severity of illness, age, weight and the presence of functional impairment and comorbidities regarding the implementation of rehabilitation also remains unclear. As a result, it is difficult to determine the appropriate timing and dose of intervention to achieve the optimal benefit for the respective patient.

An individualized approach to early mobilization which considers the pre-existing functional status, frailty, comorbidities, disease severity and invasiveness of the treatment in the ICU might be meaningful. The aim of this study was to test that it is feasible to divide the diverse group of ICU patients into specific cohorts by clustering and derive specific individualized recommendations for mobilization to increase the probability to be discharged home. We hypothesized that identifiable patient groups benefit differently from different mobilization components.

### Early mobilization and recovery in mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU: a bi-national, multi-centre, prospective cohort study [^111uBGJE]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Measurements and data collection

Research coordinators at each participating site screened the patients for eligibility and sought consent as required. Research coordinators collected demographic data including age, gender and body weight, admission source, functional co-morbidities using the functional co-morbidities index, date and time of ICU and hospital admission, and date and time of first intubation at the time of enrolment into the study. We recorded the APACHE II score utilising data from the first 24 hours of admission to ICU and daily therapeutic interventions, including administration of mechanical ventilation, vasoactive agents and renal replacement therapy.

Research coordinators or site investigators collected daily data for the first 14 days of mechanical ventilation or until ICU discharge or death, whichever occurred first. Data were collected daily at 12:00 noon and included physiological information, Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale score and maximum level of mobilisation using the ICU mobility scale. Data were also collected daily during mechanical ventilation about physiotherapy–patient interactions. Every patient was assessed by a physiotherapist to determine their ability to perform early mobilisation, as part of the standard care in each participating hospital. For patients who received early mobilisation, we collected data for all of the physiotherapy sessions on the day that the patient was seen regarding the duration of mobilisation activities, types of mobilisation activities and co-interventions (such as continuous renal replacement therapy or vasoactive agents). For patients who did not receive early mobilisation, we collected the reported barriers to mobilisation.

Early mobilisation was defined as any active exercise where the patients could assist with the activity using their own muscle strength and control that occurred while the patient was receiving invasive ventilation and was scored using the ICU mobility scale. This included the activities of rolling, bridging, sitting, standing and walking, and upper and lower limb flexion and extension, and did not preclude the patient receiving assistance from staff or equipment.

Serious adverse events were prospectively defined as a fall, unplanned extubation, cardiac arrest, loss of an invasively inserted line and new-onset atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmia, and were recorded during mobilisation sessions. We defined adverse events that required a mobilisation session to be stopped prematurely a priori. These events were a decrease in mean arterial pressure < 60 mmHg or a decrease in oxygen saturation < 88% for more than 3 minutes and occurrence of a new oxygen requirement for a fraction of inspired oxygen > 0.6.

### Systematic early versus late mobilization or standard early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1142C4Qe]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Eligibility criteria

Population

We included studies conducted in adult ICU patients (aged ≥ 18 years) requiring invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation at enrollment or during the ICU stay. We excluded studies that enrolled relevant proportions (≥ 10%) of patients with burn injuries, neurological conditions or transplant patients, as well as studies conducted in postoperative patients requiring ventilation for less than 24 h on average, as we considered these patients to have different needs or be at higher risk for adverse events than other ICU patients.

Intervention

The experimental intervention of interest was systematic early mobilization, which we defined as any physical or occupational therapy targeting muscle activation, initiated within 7 days after ICU admission and performed according to a clearly defined protocol or specific clinical criteria in all eligible patients. Neurocognitive interventions, speech therapy and ICU diary keeping were considered eligible as part of an early rehabilitation approach including systematic mobilization. Studies examining interventions primarily targeted at preventing pressure ulcers or joint stiffness, or respiratory therapy alone were not included.

Comparators

Based on a priori-defined criteria, eligible comparators were categorized as: (i) late mobilization (i.e. mobilization initiated 7 days or more after ICU admission), (ii) standard early mobilization (i.e. mobilization initiated within 7 days but less systematically, as outlined above) or (iii) no mobilization (i.e. sham intervention or no rehabilitative intervention).

Outcomes

As part of a comprehensive assessment, we prespecified multiple primary outcomes related to muscle strength and functional mobility and secondary outcomes related to quality of life, mortality, length of stay and safety (see Additional file 1). Follow-up time points considered included ICU discharge, hospital discharge, as well as 3, 6 and 12 months after hospital discharge. Out of all outcomes, the most clinically important and patient-relevant outcomes were prioritized by four ICU experts involved as stakeholders in this project without prior knowledge of the data. Here, we primarily report on these priority outcomes, which include the Medical Research Council Sum Score (MRC-SS) at ICU discharge, proportion of patients developing ICUAW during hospitalization, 6-min walk test (6MWT) performance, time needed until walking for the first time, proportion of patients returning to independence from assistance, SF-36 Physical Function Domain Score (PFS) and SF-36 Physical Health Component Summary Score (PCS) at 6 months after discharge.

### Systematic early versus late mobilization or standard early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111kY6NR]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Several limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings. First, we defined 'early mobilization' as mobilization starting within 7 days of ICU admission in line with previous reviews on the subject. Using a stricter definition limiting the intervention to early mobilization within 72 h after ICU admission would have led to the exclusion of one study and re-categorization of two studies into the late mobilization category. This would have resulted in an even weaker evidence base for systematic early mobilization compared to both late mobilization and standard early mobilization. However, it would not have altered our main conclusions.

Second, we categorized studies into comparator categories based on predefined criteria. Due to the heterogeneity of 'early mobilization' between studies, it could occur that the comparator in one study was similar in timing or nature to the experimental intervention in another study, or vice versa. This was especially the case in the standard early mobilization category. Alternative assessments showed that if studies for which the timing difference between intervention and comparator group was unclear were excluded from analysis, this would not have altered our conclusions for any of the priority outcomes. Had these studies been assigned to the late mobilization category, we would have found smaller and not statistically significant effects on MRC-SS, incidence of ICUAW, SF-36 PFS and PCS for the comparison between systematic early and late mobilization. However, our conclusions regarding the comparison between systematic early and standard early mobilization would have remained unchanged. Since our categorization may not fully reflect the timing differences between studies, a more detailed consideration of interventions and comparators in the individual studies may be warranted when making recommendations for practice.

Third, we excluded studies with relevant proportions of neurological, burns, transplant or postoperative patients requiring only short ventilation. This, as well as the language restriction, may have led to the exclusion of some studies that would have provided additional evidence and could have altered our results.

Fourth, we did not conduct a more detailed analysis of the frequency, duration and intensity, or exact implementation of the interventions. While these factors are likely to influence the effectiveness of interventions, the available information did not provide a sufficient basis for such comparisons.

Finally, we did not perform subgroup analyses other than by comparator category. While it is possible that specific patient subgroups may benefit more strongly from early mobilization than others, the available data were insufficient to conduct such subgroup analyses.

### To mobilise or not to mobilise: is that the right question? [^1117Ysgr]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Muscle atrophy commences early, within hours of commencement of invasive mechanical ventilation. Therefore, patients who receive prolonged mechanical ventilation are at high risk of muscle atrophy, severe weakness, long-term disability, and increased mortality. To mitigate these risks, early mobilisation has been recommended in at least seven international guidelines. It is a management strategy that has had widespread support from clinicians.

Early mobilisation will purportedly reduce duration of mechanical ventilation and delirium and improve functional recovery, although the evidence from individual trials has been inconsistent. The evidence for the international guidelines has been pooled from pilot studies, phase II trials, observational studies, and expert consensus.

Clinical practice guidelines universally recommend implementation of early mobilisation activities in the intensive care unit (ICU). Each of the guidelines has made recommendations for operationalising early mobilisation differently, reflecting the heterogeneity across included studies. Almost all of the guidelines highlight the importance of considerations of the ABCDE (awakening, breathing, coordination, delirium monitoring and management, and early mobility) bundle of care. As clinicians implement mobilisation, consideration for a patient's level of sedation and delirium is crucial, as the main barrier reported to early mobilisation is sedation. Other important factors for implementation include clinician expertise and the availability of specific mobilisation equipment. Daily evaluation of a patient's physiological status for the suitability of mobility activities and a-priori considerations for terminating a mobility session should be discussed. However, clinical practice guidelines should be considered according to the comprehensiveness and recency of the systematic review informing the guidelines, given the recent increase in primary research evaluating early mobilisation.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: key concepts and advances in pulmonary rehabilitation [^111bkmX8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary rehabilitation — early mobilization and exercise in critically ill respiratory failure patients emphasizes that, when patients are unable to move actively, neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) was associated with reductions in muscle atrophy and critical illness neuropathy, and quadriceps NMES plus active limb mobilization enhanced muscle strength and hastened independent transfer from bed to chair. In individuals requiring long-term mechanical ventilation, a 6-week upper and lower limb training program improved limb muscle strength, ventilator-free time, and functional outcomes compared with usual care. Organizational strategies influence mobility, as transferring a patient from the intensive care unit (ICU) to the respiratory ICU increased the number of individuals ambulating threefold versus pretransfer rates, and physical therapists mobilize critically ill individuals to higher levels of mobilization than nursing staff; physiotherapists are described as ideally heavily involved in mobilization plans, exercise prescription, and progression with medical and nursing staff.

### Investigating dose level and duration of rehabilitation of mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU [^117HmoX2]. Respiratory Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: The dose level and duration needed for early rehabilitation of mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU need to be characterized. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the association between mobilization level, rehabilitation time, and dose (defined as the mean mobilization quantification score [MQS]) during ICU admission and the end point walking independence at hospital discharge in subjects needing ICU admission. Methods: This prospective, multi-center, cohort study included 9 ICUs. Consecutive subjects admitted to the ICU between September 2022-March 2023 receiving mechanical ventilation for > 48 h were included in the study. The mean MQS score, highest ICU mobility score (IMS) during the ICU stay, time to the first mobilization day, ICU rehabilitation time (minutes of each rehabilitation physical activity from start to finish), frequency/d, baseline characteristics, and walking independence at hospital discharge were assessed. Results: Among the 116 subjects, 64 did and 51 did not walk independently at hospital discharge, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the mean MQS and time to first mobilization were significantly associated with walking independence at hospital discharge. We observed that mean MQS was better than IMS, rehabilitation time, frequency, and time to first mobilization predicted walking independence based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve comparison. Comparison of the mean MQS with that on the first mobilization day revealed superior predicting power of the mean MQS. The ROC curve cutoff value for the mean MQS was 4.0. Conclusions: This study shows that in subjects mechanically ventilated for > 48 h the dose of rehabilitation calculated using the mean MQS during ICU was a better predictor of walking independence at hospital discharge than intensity, duration, or frequency of the mobilization therapy. Mean MQS during ICU stay may be used to measure and titrate optimal mobilization therapy.

### Ten strategies to optimize early mobilization and rehabilitation in intensive care [^117AfPmR]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Evaluate optimal timing, type, and dose of intervention

Important knowledge gaps exist regarding exercise, including the timing, type, and dose of interventions. There is some evidence suggesting that starting rehabilitation within 2 or 3 days of ICU admission may be superior to later initiation. Types of interventions to be considered include active functional mobilization, in-bed cycle ergometry, electrical muscle stimulation (with or without passive/active exercises), tilt tables, and use of various rehabilitation equipment. In addition, the intensity, duration, and frequency of each intervention type are important considerations. Additional research is needed to further understand potential benefit or harm. Until that time, clinician judgement will play an important role and must be tailored to individual patients and to the dynamic nature of critical illness.

Relationship to previous studies

We defined early mobilisation as any early, active exercise during invasive ventilation, and it was not common in our cohort despite the fact that physiotherapy services were available to all ICU patients included in the study as part of standard ICU care. A snapshot of early mobilisation has been described previously in Australia and Germany in 1-day point-prevalence studies. In the Australian point-prevalence study only 45% of the 498 patients included in the study were mechanically ventilated and no active mobilisation occurred out of bed in the patients who were mechanically ventilated. This was different to the German point-prevalence study the following year, in which all patients were mechanically ventilated (n = 783) and 24% of them mobilised out of bed, although only 8% of these had an endotracheal tube inserted. Importantly, these point-prevalence studies may include patients beyond 14 days of mechanical ventilation who have stabilised from the initial critical illness but have ongoing respiratory failure. In the current study, only 36.5% of mechanically ventilated patients received any active mobilisation and < 10% of mobilisation episodes included activities out of bed, which may reflect the early time period of data collected (within 14 days of mechanical ventilation) and potential loss of data from patients with an ICU stay > 2 weeks, although we know from previous work in our region that this is a very small percentage of the ICU patients. The main reported barrier to mobilisation in our cohort was sedation, with nearly one-half of our cohort reported as too sedated for mobilisation on days 1 and 2 and > 30% on days 3 and 4. This is different to the German study where only 15% of patients were reported as having sedation as the barrier to mobilisation. In a recent editorial accompanying the German point-prevalence study, Clemmer stated that, to successfully mobilise our patients, sedation, sleep and delirium monitoring must be routine and their barriers vigorously addressed. In another study of barriers to mobilisation, the authors suggested that 47% of reported barriers to early mobilisation were potentially avoidable in a 4-week audit of 106 patients in the ICU.

### Systematic early versus late mobilization or standard early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114APW75]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This systematic review and meta-analysis found a beneficial effect of systematic early mobilization in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients on muscle strength and physical function when compared to late mobilization, but did not find evidence for such an effect when compared to standard early mobilization initiated within 7 days of ICU admission. This contrast widens the perspective on early mobilization in the ICU, highlighting the need to consider the characteristics of comparator interventions when interpreting RCT-based evidence to make recommendations for clinical practice.

### The effects of active mobilisation and rehabilitation in ICU on mortality and function: a systematic review [^113YJNgj]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Early active mobilisation and rehabilitation in the intensive care unit (ICU) is being used to prevent the long-term functional consequences of critical illness. This review aimed to determine the effect of active mobilisation and rehabilitation in the ICU on mortality, function, mobility, muscle strength, quality of life, days alive and out of hospital to 180 days, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation and discharge destination, linking outcomes with the World Health Organization International Classification of Function Framework.

Methods

A PRISMA checklist-guided systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised and controlled clinical trials.

Results

Fourteen studies of varying quality including a total of 1753 patients were reviewed. Active mobilisation and rehabilitation had no impact on short- or long-term mortality (p > 0.05). Meta-analysis showed that active mobilisation and rehabilitation led to greater muscle strength (body function) at ICU discharge as measured using the Medical Research Council Sum Score (mean difference 8.62 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39–15.86), greater probability of walking without assistance (activity limitation) at hospital discharge (odds ratio 2.13, 95% CI 1.19–3.83), and more days alive and out of hospital to day 180 (participation restriction) (mean difference 9.69, 95% CI 1.7–17.66). There were no consistent effects on function, quality of life, ICU or hospital length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation or discharge destination.

Conclusion

Active mobilisation and rehabilitation in the ICU has no impact on short- and long-term mortality, but may improve mobility status, muscle strength and days alive and out of hospital to 180 days.

### Effect of enhanced versus usual mobilization activities in critically ill adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114XPrdj]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to capture updated evidence regarding the benefits and harms of enhanced mobilization activities and explore whether specific approaches may be more beneficial than others.

Data Sources, Study Selection, and Data Extraction

This study was prospectively registered PROSPERO: CRD42024550360. Parallel group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included adult patients (≥ 18 yr old) admitted to the ICU were included. The intervention group was required to receive enhanced mobilization activities above usual care while in the ICU, while the control group received usual care, which was required to include some degree of mobilization. Four databases and two trial registries were searched until May 2024. Review and data extraction of all potentially eligible articles was performed independently and in duplicate. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach was used to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome.

Data Synthesis

Fifty-nine RCTs (n = 8462) met eligibility criteria. Enhanced mobilization activities may reduce the incidence of ICU-acquired weakness (risk ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66–0.95; moderate certainty), duration of delirium (mean difference [MD], -1.34 d; 95% CI, -1.85 to -0.83; low certainty), and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation (MD, -1.07 d; 95% CI, -1.64 to -0.50 d; moderate certainty). ICU and hospital length of stay may also be slightly reduced by enhanced mobilization (low certainty). Enhanced mobilization may result in little to no difference in adverse events (low certainty).

Conclusions

This review demonstrates that enhanced mobilization likely reduces the incidence of ICU-acquired weakness and may reduce duration of delirium, while supporting prior findings that there is little to no difference in risk of adverse events. Early mobilization may be the most promising avenue for optimizing mobilization activities and raise the question of whether the key to improving outcomes lies in early exposure to these activities rather than increased intensity.

### Clinical review: intensive care unit acquired weakness [^114nLgCd]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Reducing the duration of immobilization is another potentially important target in the prevention of ICUAW. This target can be realized by decreasing the levels of sedation. Approaches aimed at sedating patients to the minimal level needed for comfort and safety clearly have overall beneficial effects. The actual impact of such strategies on ICUAW has not been studied. Reducing the duration of immobilization with early physical therapy adjusted to the medical situation, muscle strength, and level of cooperation is another strategy that was shown to be safe and feasible in the ICU and improved outcome. Additionally, quadriceps strength at hospital discharge improved in long-stay patients receiving passive or active exercise training using a bedside ergometer, as compared with patients receiving standard physiotherapy. This training involved 20 minutes of bedcyling 5 days per week, from the 5th day following ICU admission. Both functional status and health-related quality of life at hospital discharge were also improved. Early mobilization and occupational therapy within 72 hours of initiation of mechanical ventilation in addition to daily sedation interruption improved outcome, including functional status, although the incidence of ICUAW was not reduced. The training consisted of an individually tailored daily program starting with passive range-of-motion exercises in unresponsive patients, progressing to active range-of-motion exercises, bed mobility, sitting upright, transfer training, and eventually walking. A secondary analysis of this trial reported that, after correction of other risk factors, both early mobilization and increasing insulin dose independently prevented ICUAW. Despite clear benefits from early mobilization of patients in the ICU, daily practice appears to vary significantly among centers and clinical settings and many barriers exist, hampering a wide implementation. Identification of subgroups of patients who are most likely to benefit would allow a better allocation of resources. Patients with ICUAW might represent a group of particular interest but data supporting such an approach are currently lacking. Analogous to the peripheral muscles, early mobilization of the diaphragm allowing for spontaneous breathing while avoiding overactivation is considered standard practice to minimize respiratory muscle weakness.

### Early mobilization in the ICU and diabetes: a bittersweet concoction? [^117YKeTm]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Although mortality rates due to critical illness have decreased during the past several decades as a result of improvements in clinical care in the ICU, as many as two thirds of survivors experience one or more persistent impairments as part of a post–intensive care syndrome (PICS), which manifests as physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments for years after hospitalization. Prolonged immobility in the ICU is a key independent risk factor for the acquisition of muscle and nerve disease during critical illness, referred to as ICU-acquired weakness, which leads to the long-term physical impairments seen in PICS and ultimately disability. To reduce the profound insults of critical illness on skeletal muscle and physical function, early mobilization and rehabilitation in the ICU has been studied as a PICS prevention strategy. Notably, early mobility has been shown to yield a 19% absolute risk reduction in cognitive impairment at 1 year in ICU survivors after mechanical ventilation in a recent single-center trial, in addition to reducing ICU-acquired weakness at 1 year. Although studies of early mobility performed ⩾72 hours after initiation of mechanical ventilation have not shown benefit, trials initiating early mobility within 72 hours have demonstrated improved outcomes, including better functional status before hospital discharge and reductions in ICU-acquired weakness in survivors. However, these trials left several unanswered questions about the optimal timing and "dose" of early mobility.

The Treatment of Mechanically Ventilated Adults with Early Activity and Mobilization (TEAM) randomized trial, published in 2022, was an international multicenter randomized controlled trial that randomized 750 mechanically ventilated adults to receive increased early mobilization versus usual care to investigate the optimal dose of early mobility in the ICU. To put this trial into context with earlier trials, patients in both arms were enrolled an average of approximately 80 hours after admission to the hospital, and the intervention group received approximately 21 minutes of early mobility compared to approximately 9 minutes in the control group. In comparison with usual care, the trial found no improvement from the intervention on the primary outcome, which was the number of days alive and out of the hospital at Day 180. Similarly, no benefit to early mobility was seen for secondary outcomes, including health-related quality of life and disability at 180 days. In contrast, there was a signal of an increased number of adverse events in the early mobility treatment group. The TEAM trial was a landmark study in the realm of early mobility trials and generated important additional questions about identifying responders to ICU rehabilitation.

### Feasibility of mobilisation in ICU: a multi-centre point prevalence study of mobility practices in the UK [^115chCen]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The anabolic and cardiovascular benefits of exercise are well recognised in both health and many chronic disease states. Early studies of physical activity in critical illness designed to mitigate the impact of Intensive Care Unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW) have demonstrated improved function. This evidence contributed to national UK guidance recommending instigation of early mobilisation within the critical care setting.

Nonetheless, over the following decade multiple controlled trials have failed to demonstrate superiority of any specific type, dose, or intensity of rehabilitation within critical care, with the majority showing little or no difference between the intervention and usual care. It has been argued that the benefits of mobilisation were only shown in those trials whose intervention commenced within 72 h of critical care admission. Combined with a growing appreciation of the rapidity of onset of ICUAW, this has led to a particular focus on 'early mobility' in critical illness.

A key challenge to the implementation of early mobility is patient safety. Only a small percentage of critical care patients meet physiological inclusion criteria for many rehabilitation trials, raising the question of generalisability of results. An international expert consensus on the safety of mobilising mechanically ventilated adults outlined suggested parameters of physiological status within which active mobility is safe. The authors specifically commented that an undue focus on potential adverse events attributed to mobilisation may result in missed opportunities to demonstrate benefit. However, point prevalence studies continue to show relatively low overall rates of active mobility.

A further barrier to the evidence base for mobilisation of critical care patients is the lack of definition of 'usual care' received by control patients in almost all studies. In the UK, this is assumed to be the provision of some physical rehabilitation, with timing, dose and type of rehabilitation determined by clinician assessment, as recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. There are no published studies of usual practice within UK critical care units against which mobilisation strategies can be compared or whether those undertaking out-of-bed mobilisation satisfy safety criteria. In addition, the proportion of patients who do so within the first 48–72 h is unknown.

Risk of bias and certainty of evidence

We considered nine out of twelve RCTs to be at high risk of bias in one or more criteria and therefore rated them as of 'poor overall quality'. Two studies were judged to be of 'good overall quality' and one study of 'fair overall quality'. The most frequent issues apart from the blinding of participants and personnel were incomplete outcome data and concerns related to selective reporting. Figure 2 shows an overview of the risk of bias assessment (see Additional file 2 for details). While the number of RCTs reporting results for each priority outcome was low, we found no indication for a small study effect that may have influenced our results. The GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence is presented in Table 3.

### The cost-effectiveness of early active mobilization during mechanical ventilation in the ICU: an economic evaluation alongside the treatment of mechanically ventilated adults with early activity and mobilization (TEAM) trial [^114pQgT1]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Early mobilization is recommended by the Society of Critical Care Medicine ICU Liberation Bundle. The Treatment of Mechanically Ventilated Adults With Early Activity and Mobilization (TEAM) randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared early active mobilization to usual care mobilization and found no difference in the primary outcome of days alive and out of hospital to day 180; however, it did find an increase in adverse events in the intervention group. To date, no RCT of early mobilization has reported costs or cost-effectiveness. We aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of early active mobilization from the perspective of the healthcare sector.

Design

We conducted a prospective, within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis alongside the TEAM study.

Setting

Forty-nine ICUs in six countries (Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, and Brazil).

Patients

The cost-effectiveness analysis included 733 adult ICU patients who were undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation and enrolled in the TEAM study.

Interventions

Early active mobilization or usual care mobilization.

Measurements and Main Results

A significantly higher number of hours were spent by staff in delivering high-dose early active mobilization vs. usual care mobilization; however, incremental costs were not significantly different between the groups ($1,823; 95% CI, -$10,552 to $12,027). EuroQoL-5D 5-level utility scores at 6 months were not significantly different between the groups (0.532 [se, 0.021] vs. 0.548 [se, 0.021]; p = 0.585). The probability of early active mobilization being cost-effective is less than 50%, even at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $200,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Sensitivity analyses incorporating meta-analysis data indicated that early active mobilization may be cost-saving; however, this involves the occurrence of lower QALY gains when compared with usual care mobilization.

Conclusions

Our trial-based analysis found no evidence that higher-dose early active mobilization is a cost-effective intervention compared with usual care mobilization for mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients; however, results from sensitivity analyses provided some evidence that it may be cost saving if one is willing to accept poorer outcomes. Further research is necessary to determine whether there are scenarios in which early active mobilization provides value for money.
