## Question

What is metabolic acidosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what metabolic acidosis is, preserving the thinking process and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining metabolic acidosis and distinguishing it from acidemia. Then, I should verify the pathophysiological mechanisms and classify the disorder by anion gap. Next, I will review acute versus chronic forms and their clinical consequences. After that, I need to check the diagnostic approach, including laboratory interpretation and common pitfalls. Finally, I will examine treatment principles, including when to use sodium bicarbonate, renal replacement therapy, and oral alkali, and close with special populations and controversies, making sure I continuously verify claims against the cited literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't conflate terms. Metabolic acidosis is a primary reduction in serum bicarbonate with a secondary decrease in PaCO2 and a reduction in blood pH when uncompensated, but importantly, acid retention can precede overt acidemia, meaning patients may have low-grade metabolic acidosis with normal pH due to buffering and compensation, so I should not equate a normal pH with absence of acidosis [^1117qBur] [^114vEL3o] [^113t7fRM].

> Hold on, I should verify the core mechanisms before moving on. Metabolic acidosis arises from three broad mechanisms: increased acid production (e.g., lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, toxin metabolites), decreased acid excretion (e.g., renal failure, renal tubular acidosis), and loss of base/bicarbonate (e.g., diarrhea, gastrointestinal fistulae), and the kidney's role in regenerating bicarbonate and excreting acid is central to chronic acid-base balance, so any impairment there can sustain acidosis even when production is modest [^1117qBur] [^111hy9Zi] [^113HJS1L].

> Next, I should review the classification because it frames the differential. The anion gap, calculated as [Na+] − ([HCO3−] + [Cl−]), separates high anion gap acidoses (accumulation of unmeasured organic anions like lactate, ketones, toxic alcohol metabolites) from normal anion gap (hyperchloremic) acidoses (bicarbonate loss or impaired renal acidification), and I need to remember to correct the anion gap for albumin to avoid misclassification, especially in hypoalbuminemia [^1117qBur] [^113JDFth] [^113XiPyq].

> Wait, let me verify the distinction between acute and chronic forms because the time course changes both physiology and management. Acute metabolic acidosis develops over minutes to days and often reflects overproduction of organic acids or abrupt loss of bicarbonate, whereas chronic metabolic acidosis persists for weeks to years and typically reflects impaired renal acidification or ongoing bicarbonate losses; chronic acidosis drives bone buffering and muscle protein catabolism, so the clinical consequences differ substantially by chronicity [^1117qBur] [^111hy9Zi].

> I will now examine the clinical consequences, but I should double-check that I separate acute from chronic effects. Acute acidosis can reduce myocardial contractility, lower systemic vascular resistance, impair oxygen delivery via the Bohr effect, depress catecholamine responsiveness, and predispose to arrhythmias, while chronic acidosis accelerates kidney disease progression, promotes bone demineralization, increases muscle protein catabolism, and is associated with insulin resistance and mortality in CKD; critically ill patients with moderate to severe metabolic acidosis have high mortality, underscoring prognostic significance beyond the pH value alone [^1117qBur] [^111hy9Zi] [^112Hb8H4] [^1113Jr1J].

> Let me think about the diagnostic approach and make sure I don't skip steps. I should confirm the primary process from pH, PaCO2, and HCO3−, assess the appropriateness of respiratory compensation, calculate the anion gap and correct it for albumin, and then use the gap to guide etiologic thinking; in non–anion gap acidosis, the urine anion gap helps distinguish renal from gastrointestinal bicarbonate losses, and in high anion gap cases, I should consider lactate, ketones, renal function, and toxins, using the osmolal gap when ingestion is suspected [^113XiPyq] [^113qrZvM] [^113JDFth].

> But wait, what if the bicarbonate is low and the pH is normal — could this still be metabolic acidosis? Yes, I need to check for compensated or low-grade acidosis, where buffering and hyperventilation maintain pH at the expense of bicarbonate stores; in CKD, eubicarbonatemic acidosis can exist with acid retention despite normal pH, so fasting serum bicarbonate, urine pH, and even urinary citrate can help detect early acidosis and monitor therapy response [^113t7fRM] [^116tWvb7] [^112UiYmk].

> Next, I should review treatment principles and verify where the evidence is strong versus uncertain. The cornerstone is to treat the underlying cause — restore perfusion in shock, give insulin in DKA, stop the toxin, correct diarrhea, address renal failure — while supportive care maintains oxygenation, perfusion, and electrolyte balance; routine bicarbonate for lactic acidosis or DKA is not supported by outcome data, and sodium bicarbonate is reserved for select scenarios such as severe acidemia with hemodynamic compromise or specific intoxications, ideally with careful monitoring and mitigation of side effects like ionized hypocalcemia and CO2 generation [^1117qBur] [^115qNaVZ] [^117RtCV8] [^112wKKwe].

> Hold on, I should verify the ICU data on bicarbonate because practice varies and conclusions are nuanced. Observational and randomized data suggest no mortality benefit from routine bicarbonate in lactic acidosis, though a French RCT in severe acidosis showed reduced RRT use and signals of benefit in AKI subgroups; contemporary observational analyses suggest possible hemodynamic improvements in vasopressor-dependent patients, but heterogeneity and confounding limit conclusions, so bicarbonate use should be individualized and ideally within trials or protocols that anticipate CO2 handling and calcium effects [^114fqzVA] [^112mUzxa] [^1117ueGb] [^116Ks1ZT].

> I need to ensure I cover renal replacement therapy appropriately. In severe acidosis with organ dysfunction, particularly with AKI or toxin-mediated acidosis, CRRT or intermittent hemodialysis can correct acid-base and remove acids or toxins when the kidney fails; this is especially relevant in metformin or toxic alcohol poisonings where clearance is time-critical and bicarbonate alone is insufficient [^11494PBZ] [^113WGksB] [^114iHNUk].

> Let me reconsider chronic metabolic acidosis in CKD because this is where alkali therapy has the most consistent signal. Guidelines suggest treating CKD patients with serum bicarbonate less than about 22 mmol/L using oral bicarbonate or base precursors, aiming for 22–28 mmol/L, with attention to sodium load, blood pressure, and potassium; multiple studies and meta-analyses suggest slower eGFR decline and improved kidney outcomes with bicarbonate therapy, though the largest modern trial of veverimer did not show reduced CKD progression, likely due to small bicarbonate separation, so ongoing research refines thresholds and agents [^111MEz24] [^1147SnGX] [^117NDEyB] [^113dFiFK].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied veverimer improved kidney outcomes — let me correct that. Veverimer effectively raised bicarbonate and improved patient-reported physical function in subgroup analyses, but the VALOR-CKD trial did not demonstrate slowed CKD progression, highlighting that bicarbonate repletion may improve symptoms even when hard renal endpoints are not affected, and reinforcing that the magnitude of bicarbonate correction may matter for outcome trials [^114pVP3d] [^113dFiFK].

> I should double-check special populations and drug-induced acidosis so I don't miss modifiable causes. In kidney transplant recipients, correcting acidosis with bicarbonate did not alter eGFR decline in a large RCT, so routine alkali for graft preservation is not supported; in pediatrics, neonatal immaturity predisposes to RTA and acidosis, and fluid choices can worsen hyperchloremic acidosis; topiramate and zonisamide cause dose-related carbonic anhydrase inhibition with non–anion gap acidosis, so medication reconciliation is essential when evaluating a low bicarbonate [^117GSVQY] [^113s7jPo] [^115YfctW] [^115vKWcS].

> Let me verify a common pitfall so I don't misclassify cases. Hypobicarbonatemia can reflect chronic respiratory alkalosis with appropriate renal compensation rather than metabolic acidosis; integrating ABG, clinical context, and urine studies prevents misdiagnosis and inappropriate alkali therapy, so I should always ask whether the respiratory drive explains the bicarbonate fall before labeling it as metabolic acidosis [^1116ZUbJ] [^113XiPyq].

> In summary, I need to ensure my approach remains systematic: define the acid-base disorder, classify by anion gap, determine chronicity, identify the cause, assess severity and organ impact, and tailor therapy to the cause while reserving bicarbonate for select indications; given persistent uncertainties, participation in protocols or trials and careful monitoring of electrolytes, volume status, and ventilation are prudent, and I should remain alert to evolving evidence that refines thresholds, agents, and outcomes in both acute and chronic metabolic acidosis [^1117qBur] [^11494PBZ] [^1147SnGX].

Metabolic acidosis is a **primary decrease in serum bicarbonate** [^1117qBur] with a compensatory decrease in PaCO2, leading to a fall in pH when uncompensated [^1117qBur]. It is classified as **anion gap or non–anion gap** [^113JDFth] based on the presence of unmeasured anions, and the anion gap helps identify the cause [^113XiPyq]. Management centers on **treating the underlying cause** [^113uTM3c]; sodium bicarbonate is reserved for severe acidemia (pH < 7.1–7.2) or specific indications, and renal replacement therapy is used for severe cases with organ dysfunction [^11494PBZ] [^117RtCV8]. Chronic metabolic acidosis accelerates CKD progression [^111hy9Zi], bone loss, and muscle catabolism [^111hy9Zi]; correcting acidosis can slow CKD decline and improve outcomes [^112Q6hVw] [^117NDEyB].

---

## Pathophysiology

Metabolic acidosis arises from **three mechanisms**:

- **Increased acid production**: lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis (DKA, AKA), renal failure, toxin ingestions (methanol, ethylene glycol, salicylates) [^1117qBur] [^115cHVD3].
- **Decreased acid excretion**: renal failure, renal tubular acidosis (RTA) [^111jr1sU].
- **Loss of bicarbonate**: diarrhea, gastrointestinal fistulas, ureteral diversion [^111kSWbh].

---

## Classification

Metabolic acidosis is classified by the **anion gap (AG)** [^113XiPyq]:

| **Category** | **Definition** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|-|
| High anion gap | AG > 12 mEq/L | - Lactic acidosis <br/> - Ketoacidosis <br/> - Renal failure <br/> - Toxins (methanol, ethylene glycol, salicylates) [^notfound] |
| Non–anion gap (hyperchloremic) | AG 8–12 mEq/L | - Diarrhea <br/> - RTA <br/> - Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide, topiramate) [^115YfctW] |

---

## Clinical manifestations

Clinical features vary with severity and chronicity. Acute metabolic acidosis causes **cardiovascular effects** — reduced myocardial contractility, vasodilation, hypotension, and arrhythmias [^1117qBur] — as well as **respiratory compensation** with hyperventilation (Kussmaul respirations) [^113XiPyq]. Chronic metabolic acidosis leads to bone demineralization, muscle protein catabolism, growth retardation, and insulin resistance [^111hy9Zi] [^1113Jr1J].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic approach** is essential [^113XiPyq]:

- **Arterial blood gas (ABG)**: low pH, low HCO3-, compensatory PaCO2 decrease [^1117qBur].
- **Serum electrolytes**: calculate anion gap [^113JDFth].
- **Urine studies**: urine anion gap, urine pH, osmolal gap to differentiate causes [^113qrZvM].
- **Additional tests**: lactate, ketones, renal function, toxin screens as indicated [^114RPu15].

---

## Management

Management focuses on the **underlying cause** [^113uTM3c]:

- **Treat underlying cause**: insulin for DKA, fluids for sepsis, antidotes for toxins, stop offending drugs [^112wKKwe] [^114iHNUk].
- **Sodium bicarbonate**: reserved for severe acidemia (pH < 7.1–7.2) or specific indications (e.g. hyperkalemia, certain toxin ingestions) [^117RtCV8] [^112wKKwe].
- **Renal replacement therapy (RRT)**: for severe acidosis with organ dysfunction or toxin removal [^114iHNUk].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis depends on the cause, severity, and response. Severe metabolic acidosis is associated with **high mortality**, particularly in critical illness [^112Hb8H4]. Chronic acidosis accelerates CKD progression, bone demineralization, and muscle catabolism; correcting acidosis can slow CKD decline and improve outcomes [^111hy9Zi] [^112Q6hVw].

---

Metabolic acidosis is a **primary decrease in serum bicarbonate** with compensatory respiratory responses; management targets the cause, with bicarbonate and RRT for severe cases, and correcting acidosis improves outcomes in chronic kidney disease [^1117qBur].

Conclusion

We have reviewed the recent clinical data on epidemiology and management of metabolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis is common in the ICU, and even moderate metabolic acidosis carries higher mortality than severe sepsis. Sodium bicarbonate or RRT is used occasionally to normalize acid–base imbalance due to metabolic acidosis in the ICU; however, high-quality evidence is still limited. Patients with severe metabolic acidosis and stage 2 or 3 AKI might be a possible target population for sodium bicarbonate administration. Further clinical trials are required to provide more robust information in a clinically relevant patient population.

### Metabolic acidosis [^115kCUEP]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis occurs in a number of diseases and even certain normal activities such as heavy exercise. It arises from increased endogenous acid production, exogenous acid (or acid-precursor) administration, base losses, and depression of renal acid secretion. Although the magnitude of acidosis is important, the ultimate pathophysiological impact of any metabolic acidosis is defined by the rate of change and the specific cause of the acidosis. This review discusses whole body, organ, and cellular effects of metabolic acidosis, its diagnosis by pathophysiologic categories, and treatment. The diagnosis is made by a synthesis of the clinical history, physical examination, other hematological values, serum and urinary chemistries, and arterial blood gases and electrolytes. Calculation of the anion and osmolal gaps can be effectively used to further narrow the diagnostic possibilities. Supportive care and therapy directed at the cause of the metabolic acidosis are the mainstays of treatment, since most acidotic states will spontaneously correct once the initiating cause is removed or reversed. Theoretical and clinical evidence are discussed for alkalinizing agents, whose use remains controversial except in the treatment of metabolic acidosis associated with hyperkalemia and certain drug or toxin ingestions.

### Metabolic acidosis and the progression of chronic kidney disease [^111eFY93]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of chronic kidney disease. Accumulating evidence identifies acidosis not only as a consequence of, but as a contributor to, kidney disease progression. Several mechanistic pathways have been identified in this regard. The dietary acid load, even in the absence of overt acidosis, may have deleterious effects. Several small trials now suggest that the treatment of acidosis with oral alkali can slow the progression of kidney disease.

### Metabolic acidosis and the role of unmeasured anions in critical illness and injury [^112uVzdG]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Acid-base disorders are frequently present in critically ill patients. Metabolic acidosis is associated with increased mortality, but it is unclear whether as a marker of the severity of the disease process or as a direct effector. The understanding of the metabolic component of acid-base derangements has evolved over time, and several theories and models for precise quantification and interpretation have been postulated during the last century. Unmeasured anions are the footprints of dissociated fixed acids and may be responsible for a significant component of metabolic acidosis. Their nature, origin, and prognostic value are incompletely understood. This review provides a historical overview of how the understanding of the metabolic component of acid-base disorders has evolved over time and describes the theoretical models and their corresponding tools applicable to clinical practice, with an emphasis on the role of unmeasured anions in general and several specific settings.

### The continuum of acid stress [^113t7fRM]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Acid-related injury from chronic metabolic acidosis is recognized through growing evidence of its deleterious effects, including kidney and other organ injury. Progressive acid accumulation precedes the signature manifestation of chronic metabolic acidosis, decreased plasma bicarbonate concentration. Acid accumulation that is not enough to manifest as metabolic acidosis, known as eubicarbonatemic acidosis, also appears to cause kidney injury, with exacerbated progression of CKD. Chronic engagement of mechanisms to mitigate the acid challenge from Western-type diets also appears to cause kidney injury. Rather than considering chronic metabolic acidosis as the only acid-related condition requiring intervention to reduce kidney injury, this review supports consideration of acid-related injury as a continuum. This "acid stress" continuum has chronic metabolic acidosis at its most extreme end, and high-acid-producing diets at its less extreme, yet detrimental, end.

### Acidosis in the critically ill-balancing risks and benefits to optimize outcome [^116qGb3i]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Acidosis is associated with poor outcome in critical illness. However, acidosis - both hypercapnic and metabolic - has direct effects that can limit tissue injury induced by many causes. There is also a clear potential for off-target harm with acute exposure (for example, raised intracranial pressure, pulmonary hypertension), and with exposure for prolonged periods (for example, increased risk of infection) or at high doses. Ongoing comprehensive determination of molecular, cellular and physiologic impact across a range of representative pathologies will allow us to understand better the risks and benefits of hypercapnia and acidosis during critical illness.

Metabolic acidosis is defined as an acidemia created by one of three mechanisms: increased production of acids, decreased excretion of acids, or loss of alkali. This article addresses the identification and correct diagnosis of metabolic acidosis by reviewing important historical factors, pathophysiological principles, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings accompanying common high and normal anion gap metabolic acidoses in emergency department patients.

### Bicarbonate therapy in severe metabolic acidosis [^115qNaVZ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

The utility of bicarbonate administration to patients with severe metabolic acidosis remains controversial. Chronic bicarbonate replacement is obviously indicated for patients who continue to lose bicarbonate in the ambulatory setting, particularly patients with renal tubular acidosis syndromes or diarrhea. In patients with acute lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis, lactate and ketone bodies can be converted back to bicarbonate if the clinical situation improves. For these patients, therapy must be individualized. In general, bicarbonate should be given at an arterial blood pH of ≤ 7.0. The amount given should be what is calculated to bring the pH up to 7.2. The urge to give bicarbonate to a patient with severe acidemia is apt to be all but irresistible. Intervention should be restrained, however, unless the clinical situation clearly suggests benefit. Here we discuss the pros and cons of bicarbonate therapy for patients with severe metabolic acidosis.

### Metabolic acidosis [^115VvaKe]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common disorder that occurs in a variety of clinical settings. The kidney maintains acid-base homeostasis through the elimination of protons and reabsorption/generation of bicarbonate. Metabolic acidosis develops when these mechanisms are overwhelmed or impaired, in situations such as rapid production of nonvolatile acids, abnormally high bicarbonate losses, and impaired acid excretion by the kidney. Determining the presence or absence of an anion gap is the first step in ascertaining the etiology of metabolic acidosis. The presence or absence of an osmolal gap, urine pH, and serum potassium levels may be useful in certain settings. We discuss a comprehensive approach to metabolic acidosis and present important clinical scenarios.

### Acidosis in the critically ill-balancing risks and benefits to optimize outcome [^1133nt6p]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The effects of acidosis in critical illness are complex and depend on multiple factors, including the etiology of the acidosis (hypercapnic versus metabolic), the degree of acidosis and whether the acidosis accumulates acutely or more gradually, where compensatory or adaptive mechanisms may blunt its effects. While acidosis is traditionally associated with poor outcome in critical illness, it is not clear to what extent - if any - this is a causal relationship. In any case, simple avoidance of acidosis is generally not feasible in the critically ill. In fact, conventional protective ventilation strategies that minimize lung stretch increase the prevalence of hypercapnic acidosis (HCA) in the critically ill, and have been clearly demonstrated to save lives in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, there is also a clear potential for harm with HCA or metabolic acidosis (MAC), whether due to acute exposure (for example, raised intracranial pressure, pulmonary hypertension), exposure for prolonged periods of time (for example, increased risk of infection) or high concentrations. These complexities are further underlined by the findings in multiple preclinical studies that acidosis may have direct effects which can protect cells and organs in the setting of acute organ injury. Thus, managing acidosis is an integral component of critical care, and efforts to deepen our understanding of its consequences are therefore welcome.

### Metabolic acidosis in the critically ill: part 2. causes and treatment [^114iHNUk]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

The correct identification of the cause, and ideally the individual acid, responsible for metabolic acidosis in the critically ill ensures rational management. In Part 2 of this review, we examine the elevated (corrected) anion gap acidoses (lactic, ketones, uraemic and toxin ingestion) and contrast them with nonelevated conditions (bicarbonate wasting, renal tubular acidoses and iatrogenic hyperchloraemia) using readily available base excess and anion gap techniques. The potentially erroneous interpretation of elevated lactate signifying cell ischaemia is highlighted. We provide diagnostic and therapeutic guidance when faced with a high anion gap acidosis, for example pyroglutamate, in the common clinical scenario 'I can't identify the acid — but I know it's there'. The evidence that metabolic acidosis affects outcomes and thus warrants correction is considered and we provide management guidance including extracorporeal removal and fomepizole therapy.

### Low-grade metabolic acidosis as a driver of chronic disease: a 21st century public health crisis [^112JNrCa]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Low-grade metabolic acidosis is a common phenomenon in the Western world. We have provided several ways for clinicians to test for metabolic acidosis and strategies to neutralise a high dietary acid load. A greater emphasis on low-grade metabolic acidosis should be provided during medical school so that clinicians are more aware of this condition and how to treat it.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^1147SnGX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Metabolic acidosis in CKD — practice points, treatment thresholds, and dietary guidance are as follows: Practice Point 3.10.1 states to consider use of pharmacological treatment with or without dietary intervention to prevent development of acidosis with potential clinical implications (e.g., bicarbonate < 18 mmol/l in adults). Practice Point 3.10.2 advises monitoring to ensure therapy does not result in serum bicarbonate concentrations exceeding the upper limit of normal and does not adversely affect BP control, serum potassium, or fluid status. The KDOQI Work Group agrees that acidosis in adults should only be treated with pharmacologic agents when bicarbonate < 18 mmol/l or if there is a clear indication to do so, and notes a large clinical trial of veverimer did not demonstrate a decline in a composite CKD progression outcome. Pediatric clinicians may choose to treat milder acidosis more aggressively to help optimize growth and bone health. Nutrition guidance supports prevention and treatment via increased dietary intake of fruits and vegetables, including the statement: In adults with CKD 1–4, we suggest reducing net endogenous acid production through increased dietary intake of fruits and vegetables (2C) to reduce the rate of decline of residual kidney function.

### Metabolic acidosis in CKD: core curriculum 2019 [^111hy9Zi]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Maintenance of normal acid-base homeostasis is one of the most important kidney functions. In chronic kidney disease, the capacity of the kidneys to excrete the daily acid load as ammonium and titratable acid is impaired, resulting in acid retention and metabolic acidosis. The prevalence of metabolic acidosis increases with declining glomerular filtration rate. Metabolic acidosis is associated with several clinically important complications, including chronic kidney disease progression, bone demineralization, skeletal muscle catabolism, and mortality. To mitigate these adverse consequences, clinical practice guidelines suggest treating metabolic acidosis with oral alkali in patients with chronic kidney disease. However, large clinical trials to determine the efficacy and safety of correcting metabolic acidosis with oral alkali in patients with chronic kidney disease have yet to be conducted. In this Core Curriculum article, established and emerging concepts regarding kidney acid-base regulation and the pathogenesis, risk factors, diagnosis, and management of metabolic acidosis in chronic kidney disease are discussed.

### Metabolic acidosis and the progression of chronic kidney disease [^1158pCfH]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Patients with CKD develop metabolic acidosis due to reduced kidney mass and defects in renal acid excretion. Chronic metabolic acidosis is a common complication of CKD and appears to contribute to the progression of kidney disease. High dietary acid intake has also been demonstrated to worsen kidney function by induction of metabolic acidosis and/or subclinical acid retention. The factors that have been implicated in this effect of acidosis on CKD progression include ammonia-induced activation of the alternative complement system, as well as increased endothelin and aldosterone production. Existing evidence from clinical trials suggests that alkali therapy could retard the progression of CKD. Increased fruit and vegetable consumption appears to be a reasonable alternative to alkali therapy for patients with mild metabolic acidosis and without hyperkalemia. However, definitive evidence is lacking for optimal evidence-based practice guidelines. Ongoing trials will hopefully facilitate more evidence-based treatment of metabolic acidosis in the future.

Agenda for future research

Recent clinical research, including large RCTs, has provided new evidence and advanced our understanding of the management of metabolic acidosis. However, high-quality data from rigorous clinical research to guide standard practice are still lacking. Research priorities include the following:
The benefits and harms of sodium bicarbonate on cardiovascular function
Sodium bicarbonate not only for severe metabolic acidosis but for moderate metabolic acidosis
Sodium bicarbonate for severe metabolic acidosis with stage 2 or 3 AKI (BICARICU-2, identifier NCT04010630, in progress).

Defining metabolic acidosis

Acidemia, or too much acid in the blood, only occurs when the body's buffering capacity can no longer maintain a normal pH level. A normal blood pH is considered to be 7.35–7.45. However, even at a normal blood pH metabolic acidosis can occur. In fact, once the blood pH falls below 7.4, there is usually acid retention in the body and low-grade metabolic acidosis. However, the blood pH does not drop below the normal range until metabolic acidosis has become severe. Once this occurs it is usually referred to as 'metabolic acidosis' by the clinician. However, this is actually acidemia (or too much acid in the blood). Thus, someone with a low blood pH has likely had low-grade metabolic acidosis for years or more likely decades.

Low-grade metabolic acidosis is something that many people in the Western world have. Low-grade means there are no apparent or noticeable harms but the body is retaining acid, depleting bicarbonate stores and damage is occurring in numerous tissues in the body. Typically, with low-grade metabolic acidosis, the blood pH drops slightly, as does the bicarbonate levels, but they will still be in the 'normal' range. Thus, if blood pH and/or bicarbonate levels are at the lower end of normal this is highly suggestive that someone has metabolic acidosis.

With low-grade metabolic acidosis, the total blood buffering capacity is reduced and thus a greater reliance on muscle, bone and connective tissue will be required for the elimination of additional acid. The harms of low-grade metabolic acidosis increase with age and decreasing kidney function as the kidneys ability to excrete acid goes down. The increase in the acid load in the body worsens kidney function over the long run. For example, chronic metabolic acidosis leads to nephron hypertrophy in the kidneys of animals. This is likely due to the toxic effects that ammonia has on the kidneys. Metabolic acidosis can also lead to an increased loss of sodium and potassium in the urine, as well as an increased loss of water increasing the risk of dehydration. In addition, metabolic acidosis can cause magnesium and calcium loss out the urine.

Numerous drugs and toxins can cause metabolic acidosis. The treating clinician should be aware of the many compounds that can produce metabolic acidosis following an accidental exposure, an overdose, or with therapeutic use. Awareness and comprehension of those substances associated with metabolic acidosis will facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of poisoned patients.

### Incidence and management of metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate in the ICU: an international observational study [^114fqzVA]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic acidosis is a major acid–base derangement in critically ill patients. Metabolic acidosis may impair cardiovascular contractility, which may contribute to reduced oxygen delivery to tissues, induce insulin resistance and may be associated with increased mortality. The treatment of metabolic acidosis is focused on addressing the underlying condition, i.e. shock. While the intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate in vitro can correct acidosis, its use or effect in the clinical context is unclear. In this regard, some clinicians recommend the administration of sodium bicarbonate to patients with significant metabolic acidosis. These recommendations are based on the assumption that sodium bicarbonate might restore normal cardiovascular function and subsequently improve oxygen delivery and help correct a low pH. This effect of bicarbonate on pH is supported by a recently conducted systematic review. However, in a low pH environment, hemoglobin plays a role as a buffer, by binding hydrogen ion and unloading oxygen to peripheral tissue. Administration of sodium bicarbonate may interfere with this buffering effect. Whether the intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate to correct metabolic acidosis in vivo has beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, i.e. vasopressor sparing effect, let alone patient-centered outcomes, i.e. mortality, remains controversial.

A recent multi-center, open-label, phase 3 clinical trial (n = 389) published in 2018 assessed the effect of sodium bicarbonate therapy in critically ill patients with severe metabolic acidosis. This trial reported that targeting a pH above 7.3 with intravenous sodium bicarbonate did not significantly reduce overall 28-day mortality. However, it also reported a reduction in the use of renal replacement therapy (RRT), a secondary outcome, with such treatment. These findings have renewed interest in the role of bicarbonate therapy in patients with metabolic acidosis. However, it is unclear whether these findings are relevant and applicable to clinicians and patients in other clinical settings, because the current management of metabolic acidosis in critically ill patients is unknown.

Accordingly, we aimed to investigate the incidence and current clinical management of metabolic acidosis and the use of intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy in the ICU in a multicenter, international setting and assess the association of such therapy with relevant biochemical and clinical outcomes.

### Low-grade metabolic acidosis as a driver of chronic disease: a 21st century public health crisis [^114ic2Eu]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic acidosis is a chronic condition that many people in the Western world have but do not realise it. It occurs when there is retention of acid in the body, which leads to a depletion in the bicarbonate stores of the body. The term metabolic acidosis is typically used when referring to low blood pH or acidemia due to a metabolic abnormality. However, this is inappropriate as most cases of metabolic acidosis do not have acidemia. In fact, a low blood pH is typically one of the last surrogate markers to become abnormal in those with low-grade metabolic acidosis. This is because the body maintains a normal blood pH at the expense of bicarbonate reserves. Metabolic acidosis primarily occurs inside the cell and in the fluid that surrounds our tissues (interstitial fluid). When checking for metabolic acidosis the clinician should look at fasting serum bicarbonate, urinary pH (with a measurement at least 4 hours separated from the last ingested meal) and 24-hour urinary citrate levels. While there is not a universally accepted way to diagnose low-grade metabolic acidosis, this paper will help to give the clinician insights into checking for this condition in their patients.

### Posttransplant metabolic acidosis: a neglected factor in renal transplantation? [^1161jeHF]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The occurrence and pathogenesis of metabolic acidosis after renal transplantation is reviewed. Posttransplant acidosis is shown to be a key mechanism for major metabolic complications in mineral and muscle metabolism, and for anemia, discussed in the context of both acidosis and renal transplantation.

Recent Findings

Continuous improvement in kidney transplant survival has shifted attention to long-term outcomes, specifically to disorders linked to cardiovascular disease, physical capacity and quality of life. Metabolic acidosis is gaining growing acceptance as a clinical entity and has occasionally come into focus in the context of renal transplantation. The possible link to metabolic disturbances resulting in impairment of musculoskeletal disorders and physical limitations, however, has not been considered specifically.

Summary

Available evidence suggests a high prevalence of (compensated) metabolic acidosis after renal transplantation, presenting as low serum bicarbonate and impaired renal acid excretion. This condition is associated with relevant disorders in mineral metabolism and muscle function. Current knowledge about the effects of acidosis on renal electrolyte handling, mineral metabolism and protein synthesis suggests that acid/base derangements contribute to the muscle and bone pathology, as well as anemia, encountered after kidney transplantation. Consequently, posttransplant acidosis may be a relevant factor in the causal pathway of impaired physical capacity observed in this patient group.

### Effects of veverimer on serum bicarbonate and physical function in diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease and metabolic acidosis: subgroup analysis from a randomized, controlled trial [^114pVP3d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What is already known about this subject?

Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and can accelerate CKD progression, bone demineralization and muscle protein catabolism;
patients with diabetes are prone to metabolic acidosis and functional limitations; and
few interventions for patients with diabetes and CKD have successfully improved quality of life or physical functioning.

What this study adds?

Veverimer effectively treated metabolic acidosis in patients with diabetes and CKD; and
veverimer significantly improved how patients with diabetes and CKD felt and functioned.

What impact this may have on practice or policy?

This study shows that treatment of metabolic acidosis is among the very few clinical interventions other than kidney replacement therapy that improves how patients with CKD feel and function. As a result, clinicians might more aggressively look for and treat metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD, a complication that is highly under-treated presently; and
improved physical function from treating metabolic acidosis holds promise to allow patients with CKD to better perform activities of daily living and increase their employability, a recognition that might encourage policy makers to incentivize treatment of metabolic acidosis.

### Metabolic acidosis: pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^1117qBur]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a primary reduction in serum bicarbonate (HCO(3)(-)) concentration, a secondary decrease in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) of approximately 1 mmHg for every 1 mmol/l fall in serum HCO(3)(-) concentration, and a reduction in blood pH. Acute forms (lasting minutes to several days) and chronic forms (lasting weeks to years) of the disorder can occur, for which the underlying cause/s and resulting adverse effects may differ. Acute forms of metabolic acidosis most frequently result from the overproduction of organic acids such as ketoacids or lactic acid; by contrast, chronic metabolic acidosis often reflects bicarbonate wasting and/or impaired renal acidification. The calculation of the serum anion gap, calculated as [Na⁺] − ([HCO₃⁻] + [Cl⁻]), aids diagnosis by classifying the disorders into categories of normal (hyperchloremic) anion gap or elevated anion gap. These categories can overlap, however. Adverse effects of acute metabolic acidosis primarily include decreased cardiac output, arterial dilatation with hypotension, altered oxygen delivery, decreased ATP production, predisposition to arrhythmias, and impairment of the immune response. The main adverse effects of chronic metabolic acidosis are increased muscle degradation and abnormal bone metabolism. Using base to treat acute metabolic acidosis is controversial because of a lack of definitive benefit and because of potential complications. By contrast, the administration of base for the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis is associated with improved cellular function and few complications.

### Endpoints of resuscitation [^115HSs6C]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Despite the multiple causes of the shock state, all causes possess the common abnormality of oxygen supply not meeting tissue metabolic demands. Compensatory mechanisms may mask the severity of hypoxemia and hypoperfusion, since catecholamines and extracellular fluid shifts initially compensate for the physiologic derangements associated with patients in shock. Despite the achievement of normal physiologic parameters after resuscitation, significant metabolic acidosis may continue to be present in the tissues, as evidenced by increased lactate levels and metabolic acidosis. This review discusses the major endpoints of resuscitation in clinical use.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^116kvFRd]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Deleterious hemodynamic effects of severe lactic acidosis are largely suggested by experimental data, although not fully confirmed by human studies. Pending the effectiveness of an etiological treatment, there is no efficient and validated symptomatic therapy at hand to correct a life-threatening metabolic acidosis. Upcoming research in this field should be focused on the optimal strategy to treat severe metabolic acidosis, including symptomatic therapy.

### Metabolic acidosis in the critically ill: part 1. classification and pathophysiology [^115RbJd4]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidaemia (pH < 7.35 not primarily related to hypoventilation) is common amongst the critically ill and it is essential that clinicians caring for such patients have an understanding of the common causes. The exclusive elimination routes of volatile (carbon dioxide), organic (lactic and ketone) and inorganic (phosphate and sulphate) acids mean compensation for a defect in any one is limited and requires separate provision during critical illness. We discuss the models available to diagnose metabolic acidosis including CO2/HCO3(-) and physical chemistry-derived (Stewart or Fencl-Stewart) approaches, but we propose that the base excess and anion gap, corrected for hypoalbuminaemia and iatrogenic hyperchloraemia, remain most appropriate for clinical usage. Finally we provide some tips for interpreting respiratory responses to metabolic acidosis and how to reach a working diagnosis, the consequences of which are considered in Part 2 of this review.

### Management of acute metabolic acidosis in the ICU: sodium bicarbonate and renal replacement therapy [^116Ks1ZT]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

How we manage metabolic acidosis in the ICU

Metabolic acidosis in critically ill patients is not a single disease but a syndrome driven by various underlying conditions. As such, the basic principle is to treat the underlying cause of metabolic acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate may be administered if there is a concern for the suppressed cardiac function that metabolic acidosis may cause. The rationale for using sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis is that the intravenous administration of a high SID solution would increase the pH, resulting in improved cardiac function.

The evidence on the biochemical effects of intravenous sodium bicarbonate in acute metabolic acidosis has been systematically reviewed. The summary of 12 relevant studies showed that pH, serum bicarbonate, base excess, serum sodium, and PaCO2 increased during and after the intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate. By contrast, serum anion gap and potassium decreased. Some concern was raised about intracellular acidosis due to the back-diffusion of CO2 and decreased ionized calcium that might impair cardiac contraction. However, there was no consistent evidence from the literature review that sodium bicarbonate administration was associated with decreased ionized calcium or decreased cardiac output.

### VALOR-CKD: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial evaluating veverimer in slowing progression of CKD in patients with metabolic acidosis [^113dFiFK]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Significance Statement

Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of CKD and is associated with more rapid decline of kidney function, but well-powered controlled randomized trials testing the effect of treating metabolic acidosis on slowing CKD progression have not been conducted. The VALOR-CKD study randomized 1480 individuals with CKD and metabolic acidosis, across 320 sites to placebo or veverimer (a novel hydrochloric acid binder). The findings did not demonstrate the efficacy of veverimer in slowing CKD progression, but the difference in serum bicarbonate between placebo and drug arms was only approximately 1 mEq/L. Veverimer was safe and well tolerated.

Background

Metabolic acidosis is common in CKD, but whether its treatment slows CKD progression is unknown. Veverimer, a novel hydrochloric acid binder that removes acid from the gastrointestinal tract, leads to an increase in serum bicarbonate.

Methods

In a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients with CKD (eGFR of 20–40 ml/min per 1.73 m 2) and metabolic acidosis (serum bicarbonate of 12–20 mEq/L) from 35 countries were randomized to veverimer or placebo. The primary outcome was the composite end point of CKD progression, defined as the development of ESKD (kidney transplantation or maintenance dialysis), a sustained decline in eGFR of ≥ 40% from baseline, or death due to kidney failure.

Results

The mean (± SD) baseline eGFR was 29.2 ± 6.3 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, and serum bicarbonate was 17.5 ± 1.4 mEq/L; this increased to 23.4 ± 2.0 mEq/L after the active treatment run-in. After randomized withdrawal, the mean serum bicarbonate was 22.0 ± 3.0 mEq/L and 20.9 ± 3.3 mEq/L in the veverimer and placebo groups at month 3, and this approximately 1 mEq/L difference remained stable for the first 24 months. A primary end point event occurred in 149/741 and 148/739 patients in the veverimer and placebo groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.8 to 1.2; P = 0.90). Serious and overall adverse event incidence did not differ between the groups.

Conclusions

Among patients with CKD and metabolic acidosis, treatment with veverimer did not slow CKD progression. The lower than expected bicarbonate separation may have hindered the ability to test the hypothesis.

### Sodium bicarbonate treatment and clinical outcomes in chronic kidney disease with metabolic acidosis: a meta-analysis [^116Ys63h]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Advanced CKD impairs the ability to excrete acid loads, leading to acid retention and metabolic acidosis (MA).MA is linked with several complications, including CKD progression, cardiovascular (CV) disease, and an increased risk of mortality.

Sodium bicarbonate has emerged as a therapeutic option for MA in CKD populations, with several studies suggesting its clinical benefits in preventing kidney function deterioration. – However, some studies have not identified the benefits of sodium bicarbonate in slowing eGFR decline. Previous research indicated improved eGFR with sodium bicarbonate in patients with CKD with low to normal bicarbonate levels, but its effects in patients with MA have not been specifically studied, leaving its role in CKD with concurrent MA controversial. In addition, there is currently no clear evidence regarding the effects of sodium bicarbonate on serum albumin, muscle mass, calcium and phosphate, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) in CKD populations with MA.

To address this issue, we conducted a meta-analysis to provide definitive evidence concerning the effects of oral sodium bicarbonate on prognostic markers and clinical outcomes in patients with CKD and MA.

### Metabolic acidosis or respiratory alkalosis? Evaluation of a low plasma bicarbonate using the urine anion gap [^1116ZUbJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Hypobicarbonatemia, or a reduced bicarbonate concentration in plasma, is a finding seen in 3 acid-base disorders: metabolic acidosis, chronic respiratory alkalosis and mixed metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. Hypobicarbonatemia due to chronic respiratory alkalosis is often misdiagnosed as a metabolic acidosis and mistreated with the administration of alkali therapy. Proper diagnosis of the cause of hypobicarbonatemia requires integration of the laboratory values, arterial blood gas, and clinical history. The information derived from the urinary response to the prevailing acid-base disorder is useful to arrive at the correct diagnosis. We discuss the use of urine anion gap, as a surrogate marker of urine ammonium excretion, in the evaluation of a patient with low plasma bicarbonate concentration to differentiate between metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. The interpretation and limitations of urine acid-base indexes at bedside (urine pH, urine bicarbonate, and urine anion gap) to evaluate urine acidification are discussed.

### Clinical evidence that treatment of metabolic acidosis slows the progression of chronic kidney disease [^112naoeF]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Metabolic acidosis arises from a fundamental disturbance of acid–base balance and is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Optimal cell, tissue and organ function requires the maintenance of hydrogen ion (H +) concentration within a physiologic range, which for serum is 35–45 nM (pH 7.46–7.35). The dynamic process leading to a net gain of H + in body fluids is called acidosis. When acidosis is due to a gain of 'fixed acid' H + (as opposed to the gain of 'volatile' H + because of accumulation of carbon dioxide gas, causing respiratory acidosis) and this H + gain decreases the metabolic component of the acid–base equilibrium, bicarbonate (HCO 3), it is called metabolic acidosis. If the amount or rate of added H + exceeds normal excretory capacity or if H + excretory capacity is reduced as in CKD with reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), metabolic acidosis becomes chronic. Epidemiological studies show that the prevalence of metabolic acidosis is approximately 15–19% in CKD stage 3–5 patients, with metabolic acidosis affecting approximately 3 million patients with CKD in the United States.

### Acid-base interpretation: a practical approach [^113XiPyq]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are prevalent in critically ill patients, and a systematic approach is essential for evaluation. The first step is to determine the primary process based on a patient's pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and bicarbonate measurements. After this is complete, the next step is to evaluate for respiratory or metabolic compensation. Deviations from expected compensation may indicate additional acid-base processes. For metabolic acidosis, anion gap calculation distinguishes between anion gap metabolic acidosis and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. The evaluation for anion gap metabolic acidosis includes calculating the osmolal gap and conducting a gap-gap analysis. Evaluating non-anion gap metabolic acidosis involves urine anion gap calculation. These analyses identify potential etiologies and additional acid-base disturbances. Metabolic alkalosis assessment begins with measuring urine chloride levels to determine whether the process is a result of chloride depletion. Respiratory acidosis, caused by hypoventilation, often results from chronic lung disease or neuromuscular dysfunction. Respiratory alkalosis, due to hyperventilation, is common in sepsis, chronic liver disease, and acute pulmonary embolism.

### Clinical evidence that treatment of metabolic acidosis slows the progression of chronic kidney disease [^112Q6hVw]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Based on data provided in four of the prospective studies that enrolled CKD stage 3–5 patients with overt metabolic acidosis (serum HCO₃ < 22 mEq/l), it is possible to calculate an event rate corresponding to initiation of dialysis or kidney transplant or at least 40% reduction of eGFR. In this analysis, the difference between the treatment and control groups in the increase in serum HCO 3 from the beginning to the end of the treatment period ranged from 4 to 6.8 mEq/l (Fig. 1 a). The corresponding difference in eGFR decline between the treatment and control groups was between 4.0 and 4.2 ml/min/1.73 m 2 over the 6–24-month treatment durations (Fig. 1 b). Further, the change in serum HCO 3 of 4–6.8 mEq/l corresponded with a reduction in the observed kidney event rate of between 51 and 100% in the treated groups as compared to the control groups over the four studies (Fig. 2). Taken together, these four prospective studies provide strong evidence that raising serum HCO 3 in CKD patients with metabolic acidosis significantly improves clinical outcomes.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^114qBo4m]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Not all metabolic acidoses are the same. In our cohort study, each type of metabolic acidosis had a different mortality associated with it. There was increased mortality associated with lactate and unidentified anions (SIG). Metabolic acidosis (both lactic and non-lactic) seems to be associated with high mortality and increased length of stay in hospital and in the ICU. Like that of lactate, monitoring of SIG seems warranted and this can be simplified by the use of an anion gap normalized to the patient's albumin and phosphate concentrations.

### Ileal neobladder: an important cause of non-anion gap metabolic acidosis [^112pmYb7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The differential diagnosis for a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis is probably less well known than the differential diagnosis for an anion gap metabolic acidosis. One etiology of a non-anion gap acidosis is the consequence of ileal neobladder urinary diversion for the treatment of bladder cancer.

Case Report

We present a case of a patient with an ileal neobladder with a severe non-anion gap metabolic acidosis caused by a urinary tract infection and ureteroenterostomy. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Part of the ileal neobladder surgery includes ureteroenterostomy and predisposes patients to several clinically significant metabolic derangements, including a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. These patients have an increased chronic acid load, bicarbonate deficit, and hypokalemia, which should be appreciated when resuscitating these patients.

### The relationship between anti-seizures medications and metabolic acidosis in craniotomy operations: is topiramate or zonisamide the cause of metabolic acidosis? [^1124GNka]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Metabolic acidosis, whether acute or chronic, can have significant clinical consequences. It has been linked to impaired brain metabolism and cerebral blood flow, which may be of particular concern in neurosurgical patients. Possible side effects of acute metabolic acidosis include hyperventilation, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, delirium, and joint-muscle pain. Severe acute metabolic acidosis can lead to respiratory failure, reduced cardiac output, hypotension, arrhythmias, increased seizure activity, and coma.

Intraoperative and postoperative metabolic acidosis can be caused by topiramate and zonisamide. To stabilize intraoperative hemodynamics, it is important to inquire about the ASMs used in the preoperative evaluation in terms of mortality and morbidity. Prior to intracranial surgery, it is important to evaluate the interchangeability of these drugs with the guidance of an epileptologist and implement a treatment plan. It is also important to consider postoperative intensive care follow-up for patients using zonisamide and topiramate ASMs. It is evident that larger multicentre studies are required to gain further insight into this subject.

### Low-grade metabolic acidosis as a driver of insulin resistance [^1113Jr1J]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

However, one such study has already been performed. Indeed, when using the hyperglycaemic and euglycaemic clamp technique (the gold standard for measuring insulin resistance), experimentally inducing metabolic acidosis has been proven to induce glucose intolerance. Indeed, metabolic acidosis caused a significant decrease in tissue insulin sensitivity by 32% and tissue sensitivity to exogenous insulin by 15%. Fasting insulin levels also increased, despite normal glucose concentrations, indicating insulin resistance. These harms occurred when blood pH decreased from 7.42 to 7.37, which is still considered a normal blood pH (7.35–7.45). However, serum bicarbonate decreased from 24 to 19 mEq/L (below the normal range of bicarbonate, 23–29 mEq/L, indicating low-grade metabolic acidosis). To summarise, human studies have confirmed that inducing low-grade metabolic acidosis induces insulin resistance using the gold-standard glucose clamp techniques and that correcting this metabolic acidosis improves insulin sensitivity.

Summary of the effects of acidosis on insulin resistance

Experimentally inducing metabolic acidosis in humans impairs glucose metabolism and cellular insulin sensitivity.
Correcting metabolic acidosis in humans improves insulin sensitivity.
Metabolic acidosis reduces the binding of insulin to receptors on adipocytes and induces insulin resistance in muscle.
Metabolic acidosis increases the production of cortisol, which reduces insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and fat cells.
Mild metabolic acidosis reduces the binding of insulin to its receptor and downstream intracellular insulin signalling in myoblasts and adipocytes.
A low pH decreases the expression of the insulin sensitiser adiponectin, which is a hormone that improves skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity.
Leptin secretion is downregulated in adipocytes exposed to a low pH medium, whereas sodium bicarbonate administration to people with renal-induced acidosis increases serum leptin levels.

### Differential diagnosis of nongap metabolic acidosis: value of a systematic approach [^113qrZvM]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Nongap metabolic acidosis is a common form of both acute and chronic metabolic acidosis. Because derangements in renal acid-base regulation are a common cause of nongap metabolic acidosis, studies to evaluate renal acidification often serve as the mainstay of differential diagnosis. However, in many cases, information obtained from the history and physical examination, evaluation of the electrolyte pattern (to determine if a nongap acidosis alone or a combined nongap and high anion gap metabolic acidosis is present), and examination of the serum potassium concentration (to characterize the disorder as hyperkalemic or hypokalemic in nature) is sufficient to make a presumptive diagnosis without more sophisticated studies. If this information proves insufficient, indirect estimates or direct measurement of urinary NH₄⁺ concentration, measurement of urine pH, and assessment of urinary HCO(3)(-) excretion can help in establishing the diagnosis. This review summarizes current information concerning the pathophysiology of this electrolyte pattern and the value and limitations of all of the diagnostic studies available. It also provides a systematic and cost-effective approach to the differential diagnosis of nongap metabolic acidosis.

### Low-grade metabolic acidosis as a driver of chronic disease: a 21st century public health crisis [^112UiYmk]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

It is the slow depletion in our body's buffering systems that keeps our blood pH normal despite acid overload. Thus, some individuals can have a normal blood pH level and a fully functioning buffering system in the body, whereas others can have a normal blood pH but their buffering systems are deficient. An accumulated of acid in the cell and/or the interstitial fluid can lead to cellular damage, pain and insulin resistance.

One buffering system in the body is bicarbonate. This system is the primary buffering system in the blood, and it helps to maintain a normal blood pH. Typically, serum bicarbonate levels drop prior to blood pH. Thus, measuring fasting serum bicarbonate levels is important when checking for low-grade metabolic acidosis. However, it should still be paired with several other tests. A normal serum bicarbonate level is considered 23–30 mEq/L. However, optimal serum bicarbonate levels are more around 25–30 mEq/L (preferably 27–30 mEq/L). A serum bicarbonate level at or below 24 mEq/L should be considered suboptimal and suggests low-grade metabolic acidosis, especially if paired with low urinary citrate or high urinary ammonium. A urinary pH of < 5.3 in adults or < 5.6 in children almost certainly indicates metabolic acidosis and is found in a large portion of the population. However, a urinary pH < 6.5 indicates a net acid excretion of > 40 mEq, which can lead to acid retention and metabolic acidosis in approximately 50% of the population. Thus, even a urinary pH of 6.5 or less can suggest low-grade metabolic acidosis. For most individuals, an optimal urinary pH is ~6.8–7.0, which signifies a net acid excretion of approximately zero. Box 1 summarises the ways to test for low-grade metabolic acidosis.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^117RtCV8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In summary, there is no mortality benefit or demonstrated improvement in hemodynamics with use of sodium bicarbonate in lactic acidosis, although emerging data suggest patients with persistent metabolic acidosis and acute kidney injury may benefit from an infusion of bicarbonate after initial resuscitation. Emphasis should be placed on treatment of the underlying cause of the acidosis.

Recommendation

The routine use of bicarbonate supplementation for lactic acidosis and shock states is not recommended. There may be a role for an infusion of sodium bicarbonate after initial resuscitation in patients with acute kidney injury and pH < 7.2, although data are limited, and ongoing trials are evaluating benefit (Level of evidence: B).

Cardiac Arrest

The benefit of rapid pushes of ampules of sodium bicarbonate therapy in cardiac arrest is controversial. Decreased perfusion leads to hypoxia, anaerobic glycolysis, and generation of lactate. In addition, cessation of spontaneous ventilation causes buildup of carbon dioxide, decreases coronary perfusion pressure, and contributes to a mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis. Acidemia has detrimental effects on hemodynamics, increases myocardial irritability, and lowers the threshold for dysrhythmias. Indeed, the use of sodium bicarbonate was initially part of Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines dating back to 1976. However, over the years, data emerged that did not show improvement in resuscitation outcomes with bicarbonate supplementation, thus calling into question the routine use of sodium bicarbonate during resuscitation. Subsequently, incorporation of sodium bicarbonate during cardiac arrest began to fall out of favor, instead emphasis has shifted to early defibrillation and high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation to augment coronary perfusion with improved patient centered outcomes.

### Role of NHE1 in the cellular dysfunction of acute metabolic acidosis [^113eQpw6]. American Journal of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Metabolic acidosis is associated with impaired cellular function. This has been attributed to the accompanying reduction in intracellular and interstitial pH of the myocardium. Recent studies suggest that activation of the cellular Na(+)-H(+) exchanger NHE1 might contribute to myocardial dysfunction. This review examines the experimental evidence which supports the role of NHE1 in the genesis of acidosis-induced cellular dysfunction, the benefits of its inhibition, and the type of acidosis that might benefit from therapy.

Summary

Information was obtained by searching MEDLINE for articles published between 1969 and 2013 using the terms: NHE1, metabolic acidosis, lactic acidosis, ischemia-reperfusion, shock, resuscitation, high anion gap acidosis, and non-gap acidosis. Each article was also reviewed for additional suitable references. Nineteen manuscripts published between 2002 and 2013 assessed the impact of inhibition of NHE1 on cellular function. They revealed that NHE1 is activated with metabolic acidosis associated with hypoxia, hypoperfusion, hemorrhagic shock, and sepsis. This was associated with a rise in cellular sodium and calcium and cardiac dysfunction including reduced contractility and a predisposition to cardiac arrhythmias. Inhibition of NHE1 with specific inhibitors improved cardiac function, reduced blood and tissue levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and decreased mortality. Key Message: These results suggest that use of inhibitors of NHE1 might be worthwhile in the treatment of some types of acute metabolic acidosis, specifically the lactic acidosis associated with hypoxia, hemorrhagic shock, and cardiac arrest. Its potential role in the treatment of other forms of acute metabolic acidosis remains to be determined.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^115W2W1J]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

This study thus raises the question about what is hoped to be achieved when initially investigating possible DKA in an acute setting. Is it to establish if there is hyperglycemia present (or another cause) which is sufficient to lead to hyperketonemia and then to determine whether this has resulted in a significant metabolic acidosis (a 'D-K-A' strategy)? Or is it to establish the reverse, namely, if there is a metabolic acidosis present, whether ketonemia is its major (or only) source and then to determine if hyperglycemia also exists (an 'A-K-D' strategy)? It could be argued that any life-threatening situation is likely to be a consequence of acidosis rather than ketonemia, irrespective of whether hyperglycemia exists, although acid-base compensatory mechanisms mean pH or bicarbonate measurements alone are unlikely to be perfect triage tests either. Certainly, guidelines cannot cover every clinical presentation and, as previously pointed out, some, such as the ADA position statement, make clear that the criteria may be inaccurate in roughly 10% of cases. In our study, 22 of 133 episodes of potential DKA (~ 17%) with a bicarbonate concentration ≤ 18mmol/L were either not diagnostically hyperglycemic (> 13.9mmol/L, n = 8) or ketonemic (≤ 3mmol/L, n = 9) or both (n = 5).

### Renal tubular acidosis [^111jr1sU]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Renal tubular acidosis should be suspected in poorly thriving young children with hyperchloremic and hypokalemic normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, with/without syndromic features. Further workup is needed to determine the type of renal tubular acidosis and the presumed etiopathogenesis, which informs treatment choices and prognosis. The risk of nephrolithiasis and calcinosis is linked to the presence (proximal renal tubular acidosis, negligible stone risk) or absence (distal renal tubular acidosis, high stone risk) of urine citrate excretion. New formulations of slow-release alkali and potassium combination supplements are being tested that are expected to simplify treatment and lead to sustained acidosis correction.

### Sodium bicarbonate for kidney transplant recipients with metabolic acidosis in Switzerland: a multicentre, randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^117GSVQY]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Metabolic acidosis is common in kidney transplant recipients and is associated with declining graft function. Sodium bicarbonate treatment effectively corrects metabolic acidosis, but no prospective studies have examined its effect on graft function. Therefore, we aimed to test whether sodium bicarbonate treatment would preserve graft function and slow the progression of estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline in kidney transplant recipients.

Methods

The Preserve-Transplant Study was a multicentre, randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at three University Hospitals in Switzerland (Zurich, Bern, and Geneva), which recruited adult (aged ≥ 18 years) male and female long-term kidney transplant recipients if they had undergone transplantation more than 1 year ago. Key inclusion criteria were an estimated GFR between 15 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 and 89 mL/min per 1·73 m 2, stable allograft function in the last 6 months before study inclusion (< 15% change in serum creatinine), and a serum bicarbonate of 22 mmol/L or less. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to either oral sodium bicarbonate 1·5–4·5 g per day or matching placebo using web-based data management software. Randomisation was stratified by study centre and gender using a permuted block design to guarantee balanced allocation. We did multi-block randomisation with variable block sizes of two and four. Treatment duration was 2 years. Acid-resistant soft gelatine capsules of 500 mg sodium bicarbonate or matching 500 mg placebo capsules were given at an initial dose of 500 mg (if bodyweight was < 70 kg) or 1000 mg (if bodyweight was ≥ 70 kg) three times daily. The primary endpoint was the estimated GFR slope over the 24-month treatment phase. The primary efficacy analyses were applied to a modified intention-to-treat population that comprised all randomly assigned participants who had a baseline visit. The safety population comprised all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03102996.

Findings

Between June 12, 2017, and July 10, 2019, 1114 kidney transplant recipients with metabolic acidosis were assessed for trial eligibility. 872 patients were excluded and 242 were randomly assigned to the study groups (122 [50%] to the placebo group and 120 [50%] to the sodium bicarbonate group). After secondary exclusion of two patients, 240 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The calculated yearly estimated GFR slopes over the 2-year treatment period were a median -0·722 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 (IQR -4·081 to 1·440) and mean -1·862 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 (SD 6·344) per year in the placebo group versus median -1·413 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 (IQR -4·503 to 1·139) and mean -1·830 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 (SD 6·233) per year in the sodium bicarbonate group (Wilcoxon rank sum test p = 0·51; Welch t-test p = 0·97). The mean difference was 0·032 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 per year (95% CI -1·644 to 1·707). There were no significant differences in estimated GFR slopes in a subgroup analysis and a sensitivity analysis confirmed the primary analysis. Although the estimated GFR slope did not show a significant difference between the treatment groups, treatment with sodium bicarbonate effectively corrected metabolic acidosis by increasing serum bicarbonate from 21·3 mmol/L (SD 2·6) to 23·0 mmol/L (2·7) and blood pH from 7·37 (SD 0·06) to 7·39 (0·04) over the 2-year treatment period. Adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in both groups. Three study participants died. In the placebo group, one (1%) patient died from acute respiratory distress syndrome due to SARS-CoV-2 and one (1%) from cardiac arrest after severe dehydration following diarrhoea with hypotension, acute kidney injury, and metabolic acidosis. In the sodium bicarbonate group, one (1%) patient had sudden cardiac death.

Interpretation

In adult kidney transplant recipients, correction of metabolic acidosis by treatment with sodium bicarbonate over 2 years did not affect the decline in estimated GFR. Thus, treatment with sodium bicarbonate should not be generally recommended to preserve estimated GFR (a surrogate marker for graft function) in kidney transplant recipients with chronic kidney disease who have metabolic acidosis.

### Clinical evidence that treatment of metabolic acidosis slows the progression of chronic kidney disease [^115TqLY2]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The importance of normalizing serum HCO 3 in CKD patients with metabolic acidosis is reflected in the leading treatment guidelines for CKD. The US-based National Kidney Foundation's KDOQI guidelines state that serum HCO 3 levels should be maintained at 22 mEq/l or greater and recommend the use of oral alkali supplements to attain this goal, whereas maintaining an awareness of the complications related to the use of such supplements. Similarly, guidelines from KDIGO suggest that in patients with CKD and serum bicarbonate less than 22 mEq/l treatment with oral bicarbonate supplementation can be given to maintain serum bicarbonate within the normal range unless contraindicated. Several large retrospective database analyses show that clinical outcomes for CKD patients with serum HCO 3 levels that are below normal (i.e. < 22 mEq/l) are significantly worse compared with patients with normal serum HCO 3 (i.e. 22–29 mEq/l). In addition, several single-center, prospective studies examining the effects of sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate, or dietary interventions have also elucidated the beneficial effects of treating chronic metabolic acidosis. In four of the seven key interventional studies discussed here, the provision of oral bicarbonate supplementation increased serum HCO 3 in enrolled CKD patients with baseline serum HCO 3 less than 22 mEq/l, often within 6 months of treatment initiation. Further, long-term treatment of metabolic acidosis (1–3 years) or treatment of hypertension-associated nephropathy patients with normal serum HCO 3 belying an increased acid load (5 years), showed direct benefit on reducing eGFR decline and improving kidney outcomes. Importantly, these improvements were accompanied by a reduction in the expression of urine biomarkers that reflect continued injury to kidneys exposed to chronic acid loading. A post hoc analysis of data from the Phisitkul et al. study showed that the provision of oral alkali to CKD patients with metabolic acidosis reduced the number of patients who experienced at least 40% decline in eGFR, an accepted surrogate endpoint of kidney disease progression to ESKD. Although 27.6% of control patients in this study showed at least 40% decline in eGFR over the 2-year treatment interval, no patients in the sodium citrate treatment group experienced eGFR declines of this magnitude (Table 3; Fig. 2). A limitation of the studies reviewed here is in the enrollment of patients who did not have severe comorbidities commonly found in CKD (e.g. edema, heart failure, poorly-controlled hypertension), as treatment with sodium-based oral alkali might aggravate fluid homeostasis in such patients. Based on these findings, it seems likely that nutritional and pharmacologic management of metabolic acidosis preserves kidney function, and larger scale, multicenter testing of this hypothesis is warranted.

### Lactic acidosis in a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113WGksB]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis occurs when lactate production exceeds its metabolism. There are many possible causes of lactic acidosis, and in any given patient, several causes may coexist. This Attending Rounds presents a case in point. Metformin's role in the pathogenesis of lactic acidosis in patients with diabetes mellitus is complex, as the present case illustrates. The treatment of lactic acidosis is controversial, except for the imperative to remedy its underlying cause. The use of sodium bicarbonate to treat the often alarming metabolic derangements may be quite efficacious in that regard but is of questionable benefit to patients. Renal replacement therapies (RRTs) have particular appeal in this setting for a variety of reasons, but their effect on clinical outcomes is untested.

### Clinical efficacy of sodium bicarbonate in treating pediatric metabolic acidosis with varying level of acid-base balance parameters: a real-world study [^1158Z3Vt]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Metabolic acidosis is an acid–base imbalance that depletes the body's buffers, resulting in a decrease in serum bicarbonate (HCO3 −) concentration, which leads to a secondary reduction in carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) levels and a decrease in blood pH. Critically ill patients, such as those with sepsis, severe hypoxemia, and cardiogenic shock, are often susceptible to developing metabolic acidosis, which can cause hemodynamic instability, reduced myocardial contractility, impaired cellular oxygen supply and mitochondrial oxygen consumption, compromised catecholamine reactivity, and an increased risk of mortality. Moderate to severe metabolic acidosis affects around 8.4% of ICU patients, with ICU and hospital mortality rates of 17.3% and 21.5%, respectively.

To restore normal cardiovascular function and oxygen delivery to tissues, intravenous sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3, SB) solutions have been commonly administered over the past two decades, with the assumption that SB raises extracellular pH by delivering sodium ions and bicarbonate, consequently increasing extracellular strong ion difference (SID) with the sodium ion remaining in its monovalent form. Despite the commonality of this clinical practice, there is inadequate assessment of the effect of SB on biochemical parameters, with controversy remaining as to whether treating metabolic acidosis with SB results in improved clinical outcomes. Studies have found that treating adults and children with severe metabolic acidosis with SB does not improve mortality or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. However, SB treatment has demonstrated the potential to reduce organ damage and 28-day mortality rate in acute kidney injury patients with an Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) score of 2 or 3, reducing the demand for renal replacement therapy and facilitating early weaning from mechanical ventilation and shortening ICU stays in hyperlactate sepsis patients. Although it does not improve hemodynamic parameters, some scholars have recommended SB infusion in patients with a pH of less than 7.15. Nevertheless, this treatment has not been proven to improve overall mortality.

### Monitoring acid base status in CKD patients: can urinary citrate help? [^116tWvb7]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is an early and deleterious complication of chronic kidney disease. Because it is frequently eubicarbonatemic, diagnosis may be difficult. In this issue, Gianella et al. suggest that lower urinary citrate excretion, considered as an homeostatic response to metabolic acidosis, may be helpful for early diagnosis and monitoring of alkali treatment. This study should be an incentive for further assessment of the tubular handling of urinary citrate in CKD patients and determination of the performance of urinary citrate for the diagnosis of eubicarbonatemic metabolic acidosis and monitoring of alkali therapy.

### Hemodynamic instability and abnormal vasopressor responsiveness in the setting of severe metabolic acidosis treated with adapted alkalinization and continuous renal replacement therapy in the emergency department [^114TJZfa]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Whereas laboratory data and clinical experience suggest that metabolic acidosis deleteriously affects certain cardiovascular functions and may contribute to hemodynamic compromise, treatment of acidemia itself with alkalinization therapy, predominantly in the form of bolus dosing of intravenous sodium bicarbonate, has not been shown to improve hemodynamics or patient-oriented outcomes in clinical trials. Detailed examination of the biochemical effects of standard sodium bicarbonate administration reveals a possible explanation: ionized serum hypocalcemia, serum hypercarbia, and a paradoxical decrease in intracellular pH occur when bicarbonate is given alone and rapidly, without adjustment in minute ventilation or calcium supplementation. "Adapted alkalinization" treatment countering these side effects through hyperventilation, calcium supplementation, and slower sodium bicarbonate infusion has been studied in animals, but not yet described in humans.

Case Report

We report a case of successful treatment of severe hemodynamic instability and vasopressor hyporesponsiveness in the setting of profound metabolic acidosis with such an adapted alkalinization approach, plus short-term continuous renal replacement therapy, in a critically ill patient, all performed in the emergency department. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians encounter patients with severe metabolic acidosis, shock, and hemodynamic instability despite vasopressor agents. Adapted alkalinization therapy with sodium bicarbonate, hyperventilation, and calcium administration may promote hemodynamic stability in such patients and allow for successful treatment of the underlying disease process.

### Metabolic acidosis of chronically hemodialyzed patients [^115Kccqh]. American Journal of Nephrology (2003). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a condition that is commonly encountered in both chronic renal failure and in end-stage renal disease. Metabolic acidosis is associated with many adverse effects: negative nitrogen balance, increased protein decomposition, anorexia, fatigue, bone lesions, impaired function of the cardiovascular system, impaired function of the gastrointestinal system, hormonal disturbances, insulin resistance, hyperkalemia, altered gluconeogenesis and triglyceride metabolism, increased progression of chronic renal failure, and growth retardation in children. Even 'minor' degrees of metabolic acidosis are deleterious. Metabolic acidosis of end-stage renal patients could be successfully corrected with bicarbonate hemodialysis and with peroral bicarbonate-containing phosphate binders, i.e. calcium carbonate. Bicarbonate powder compared with bicarbonate solutions has some advantages and enables a stabile composition of electrolytes. 'High' dialysate bicarbonate (40–42 mmol/l) is a safe, well-tolerated and useful tool for better correction of the metabolic acidosis and must become a standard of hemodialysis treatment. Measured postdialysis blood bicarbonate concentration should be obtained at least every month and correction of metabolic acidosis by maintaining serum bicarbonate ≥ 22 mmol/l should be a goal of the management of patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis.

Although the definition of renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is simple, understanding the physiologic basis underlying the various types of this clinical entity is much more difficult. The pathophysiology of this disorder is reviewed using the normal acid-base functions of the involved segments of the nephron as a guide to understanding. Clinical and laboratory features of the subtypes of RTA are addressed, and diagnosis and treatment discussed. New developments in the knowledge and understanding of the associated growth disturbances, mineral metabolism, and molecular biology of RTA are also reviewed to provide the most current view of this relatively common pediatric entity.

### Acid-base disorders in the critically ill patient [^113uTM3c]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are common in the intensive care unit. By utilizing a systematic approach to their diagnosis, it is easy to identify both simple and mixed disturbances. These disorders are divided into four major categories: metabolic acidosis, metabolic alkalosis, respiratory acidosis, and respiratory alkalosis. Metabolic acidosis is subdivided into anion gap and non-gap acidosis. Distinguishing between these is helpful in establishing the cause of the acidosis. Anion gap acidosis, caused by the accumulation of organic anions from sepsis, diabetes, alcohol use, and numerous drugs and toxins, is usually present on admission to the intensive care unit. Lactic acidosis from decreased delivery or utilization of oxygen is associated with increased mortality. This is likely secondary to the disease process, as opposed to the degree of acidemia. Treatment of an anion gap acidosis is aimed at the underlying disease or removal of the toxin. The use of therapy to normalize the pH is controversial. Non-gap acidoses result from disorders of renal tubular H + transport, decreased renal ammonia secretion, gastrointestinal and kidney losses of bicarbonate, dilution of serum bicarbonate from excessive intravenous fluid administration, or addition of hydrochloric acid. Metabolic alkalosis is the most common acid-base disorder found in patients who are critically ill, and most often occurs after admission to the intensive care unit. Its etiology is most often secondary to the aggressive therapeutic interventions used to treat shock, acidemia, volume overload, severe coagulopathy, respiratory failure, and AKI. Treatment consists of volume resuscitation and repletion of potassium deficits. Aggressive lowering of the pH is usually not necessary. Respiratory disorders are caused by either decreased or increased minute ventilation. The use of permissive hypercapnia to prevent barotrauma has become the standard of care. The use of bicarbonate to correct the acidemia is not recommended. In patients at the extreme, the use of extracorporeal therapies to remove CO 2 can be considered.

### Incidence and management of metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate in the ICU: an international observational study [^112mUzxa]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Key findings

Early metabolic acidosis was common in our study cohort, and early intravenous sodium bicarbonate was variably used in such patients across the study ICUs. Most patients who received sodium bicarbonate did so as a bolus dose. However, the prescription was not adjusted for body weight or the severity of metabolic acidosis. Patients who received sodium bicarbonate had a higher severity of critical illness and more severe metabolic acidosis. However, their biochemical parameters and PaO2/FiO2 ratios improved more rapidly than for patients who did not receive bicarbonate. Early sodium bicarbonate was not significantly associated with improved clinical outcomes overall. However, in patients with vasopressor dependency at diagnosis, sodium bicarbonate was associated with higher mean arterial pressures within six hours and a favorable, but not statistically significant, aOR for ICU mortality.

Relationship with prior studies

A recent systematic review reported that the biochemical and physiological effects of sodium bicarbonate had been poorly examined. Such a lack of data significantly limits our understanding of how much and how fast sodium bicarbonate should effectively be given to patients with metabolic acidosis. The current study confirms that the speed of administration, the mode (bolus or infusion or both), and the dose are highly variable and not related to any clinical or biochemical parameters. Moreover, despite the suggested rationale for administering sodium bicarbonate, there is a paucity of recent data exploring any effect on hemodynamic indices. Thus, our study is the first contemporary work to indicate that this therapy might increase mean arterial pressure early in patients on vasopressors at the diagnosis of metabolic acidosis, a finding consistent with the putative effect on the cardiovascular system.

The effects of sodium bicarbonate on clinical outcomes have been rarely reported, except for a recent randomized clinical trial conducted in France. This trial reported that administration of sodium bicarbonate for severe metabolic acidosis defined by pH ≤ 7.20, PaCO 2 ≤ 45 mm Hg, and bicarbonate concentration ≤ 20 mmol/L decreased the need for RRT by 16.7%. Moreover, in patients with AKI, sodium bicarbonate reduced mortality by 17.7%. The results suggest promising effects of sodium bicarbonate therapy for metabolic acidosis; however, the trial was not blinded, creating the possibility of performance bias and focused only on severe metabolic acidosis. Thus, the applicability and relevance of the findings are unclear for most patients in the ICU. The current study demonstrated that mild to moderate metabolic acidosis defined by pH < 7.3 and BE < -4 mEq/L were frequently observed in the ICU, and sodium bicarbonate was commonly used in such patients.

INCREASING SERUM BICARBONATE SLOWS PROGRESSION OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

Five studies have examined the impact of metabolic acidosis treatment with oral alkali or base-producing dietary interventions on the progression of kidney disease in CKD stage 3–5 patients with reduced serum HCO 3 (< 22 mEq/l) (Table 1). The study by de Brito-Ashurst et al. represented an important first step in linking correction of low serum HCO 3 and improved outcomes in patients with CKD and metabolic acidosis. In this single-center, open-label, prospective, parallel-group study, 134 CKD stage 4–5 patients with metabolic acidosis (serum HCO₃ > 16 and < 20 mEq/l) were randomized 1:1 to intervention with oral sodium bicarbonate, administered as 600 mg tablets three times per day and increased as necessary to achieve and maintain serum HCO 3 at least 23 mEq/l, or standard of care for 2 years. The objectives of the study were to assess the effects of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy on progression of CKD and on nutritional status in these predialysis patients. The study population had an average baseline creatinine clearance of ∼20 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and an average baseline serum HCO 3 level of ∼20 mEq/l. Study criteria excluded patients with poorly controlled blood pressure (BP; > 150/90 mmHg, despite use of four agents), overt congestive heart failure, morbid obesity, and chronic sepsis, all conditions with potential fluid balance complications that could be worsened with ingestion of ∼500 mg of sodium that accompanied the average oral sodium bicarbonate daily dose administered in this study (1.82 ± 0.80 g/day). At the end of the 2-year study, serum HCO 3 increased in the treated patients by approximately 4 mEq/l compared with the control group (Fig. 1 a); these results were clinically meaningful and statistically significant (P < 0.0001). Compared with the control group, decline in creatinine clearance was slower with sodium bicarbonate supplementation (−1.88 versus −5.93 ml/min/1.73 m 2; P < 0.0001), a difference of approximately 4 ml/min/1.73 m 2 over the 2-year treatment period (Fig. 1 b). Patients who received treatment for their metabolic acidosis were also significantly less likely than controls to experience rapid progression of kidney failure (9 versus 45%; P < 0.0001) or to develop ESKD (6.5 versus 33%; P < 0.001) over the 2-year treatment period (Fig. 2). Thus, this landmark study demonstrated the beneficial effects of increasing serum HCO 3 on slowing the progression of kidney disease to an extent that was both statistically significant and clinically meaningful.

See Bonus NeoBriefs videos and downloadable teaching slides Metabolic acidosis can manifest in the neonatal period and cause significant morbidity and mortality in neonates. Preterm infants are at an even higher risk of developing metabolic acidosis. If the acidosis results from a dysfunction of acid-base homeostasis by the renal system, the disorder is known as renal tubular acidosis (RTA). In this review, we will describe renal development and normal acid-base homeostasis by the renal system. We will also discuss the pathophysiology of the different types of RTA, laboratory findings to aid in diagnosis, and treatment considerations. Understanding RTA will help neonatal clinicians recognize and diagnose an infant affected by RTA and initiate treatment in a timely manner.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^113qwkTi]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

An inconsistent relationship has been reported between acid–base abnormalities, their treatment, and outcomes in critically ill patients. Some studies have suggested an independent association between low pH or standard base excess (SBE) and mortality, whereas others have not.

We have recently shown that hemodynamically stable rats with sepsis become hypotensive after infusion of dilute HCl. Similarly we have found decreased survival time in rats with elevated serum chloride levels that were exposed to lethal doses of lipopolysaccharide, as well as different cytokine responses to acidosis induced by lactate or HCl in cell cultures. We therefore propose that the etiologic anion of metabolic acidosis (lactate, chloride, or others) may be a more important determinant of outcome than the pH itself.

Although lactic acidosis has attracted considerable study in critically ill patients, metabolic acidosis can result from a variety of conditions. Although the existing literature does not suggest a strong relationship between the type of acidosis and outcome, traditional methods of classifying and analyzing acid–base abnormalities have significant limitations, especially in critically ill patients. In particular, studies have usually failed to identify the effects that causative anions (for example lactate, chloride, or all others) have on their resulting pH and SBE. Data may be reported as 'non-lactate metabolic acidosis' or 'anion gap metabolic acidosis' without identifying a predominant source. By using a physical–chemical approach to quantify unmeasured anions accurately, coupled with multivariable logistic regression, we believe that a more rigorous characterization of acid–base disorders and their clinical significance can be achieved. Our objective was to determine the effect of different etiologies of metabolic acidosis on hospital mortality and length of stay in critically ill patients suspected of having lactic acidosis. The hypothesis was that the various etiologies of metabolic acidosis have unique mortality and morbidity rates associated with them.

### Zonisamide [^115vKWcS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic Acidosis:

Zonisamide causes hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis) (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests subsection). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to the inhibitory effect of zonisamide on carbonic anhydrase. Generally, zonisamide-induced metabolic acidosis occurs early in treatment, but it can develop at any time during treatment. Metabolic acidosis generally appears to be dose-dependent and can occur at doses as low as 25 mg daily.

Conditions or therapies that predispose to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of zonisamide.

Some manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae including cardiac arrhythmias or stupor. Chronic, untreated, metabolic acidosis may increase the risk for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. Nephrolithiasis has been observed in the clinical development program in 4% of adults treated with zonisamide, has also been detected by renal ultrasound in 8% of pediatric treated patients who had at least one ultrasound prospectively collected, and was reported as an adverse event in 3% (4/133) of pediatric patients (see PRECAUTIONS, Kidney Stones subsection). Metabolic acidosis can also increase the risk for hyperammonemia, particularly in the presence of drugs which can cause hyperammonemia.

INTRODUCTION

Acid produced daily through metabolism and diet is initially neutralized through titration and reduction of serum bicarbonate, which must ultimately be excreted to maintain normal acid–base homeostasis. Normally functioning kidneys maintain this homeostasis through acid excretion and regeneration of new bicarbonate to replace the titrated bicarbonate and thereby restore serum bicarbonate to normal. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) develop metabolic acidosis due to acid retention from impaired kidney acid excretion due in part to reduced kidney ammoniagenesis. Reduced renin–aldosterone–angiotensin II system activity and reduced responsiveness to aldosterone (Type IV renal tubular acidosis) further contribute to metabolic acidosis in patients with diabetes. Metabolic acidosis increases the risk of CKD progression and causes bone demineralization, muscle protein catabolism and loss of muscle mass. Acidemia directly stimulates glutamine extraction from blood by several fold and increases proximal tubule glutamine catabolism — a process that generates new bicarbonate, which is transported into the blood and ammonia, which is excreted into the urine. The increased need for glutamine to support maximal renal ammoniagenesis is met, in part, by metabolic acidosis-induced skeletal muscle protein catabolism. While skeletal muscle protein catabolism facilitates acid excretion, bones facilitate acid buffering. Bone is a large repository of carbonate and phosphate, which when released into the blood can serve as an acid buffer. Metabolic acidosis induces direct dissolution of bone and activation of osteoclasts, which break down bone leading to release of carbonate and phosphate from the skeleton, reducing bone density and strength. In patients with CKD and metabolic acidosis the bone histology is predominantly osteomalacia and it is not reversible with calcitriol treatment. In patients with CKD, both low bone mineral density and annual percent decline in bone mineral density have been shown to be significant predictors of incident fractures.

Insulin normally inhibits muscle protein degradation but patients with CKD and metabolic acidosis have reduced sensitivity to the suppression of protein catabolism by insulin. These defects may change body tissue composition analogous to fasting and/or low energy intake that overlap with alterations in insulin sensitivity that occur with aging. As such, metabolic acidosis in patients with diabetes and CKD may contribute to the premature functional decline observed clinically in these patients. Data from a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling US adults found that in patients ≥ 60 years with diabetes, 32% of women and 15% of men reported an inability to walk a quarter of a mile, climb stairs or do housework compared with 14% of women and 8% of men without diabetes. The effect of treating metabolic acidosis on physical function in patients with diabetes and CKD has not been reported previously.

### Topiramate [^115YfctW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

Topiramate can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by topiramate. Topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of topiramate.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with topiramate in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to < 2% for placebo.

Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L.

### Understanding base excess (BE): merits and pitfalls [^114W1r44]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

SBE is a useful parameter to assist in the diagnosis of metabolic acid–base disorders and to assess the metabolic displacement quantitatively. It is a calculated value, that relies on several measured variables (pH, PCO 2, hemoglobin concentration) and assumes normal plasma proteins. Importantly, SBE by itself does not provide information about the underlying condition and could be perfectly normal in the case of multiple conditions acting in opposite directions. Therefore, while an abnormal SBE is a reliable marker of an active metabolic issue, a normal SBE is not enough to exclude it. For this reason, SBE cannot be considered a stand-alone parameter. Indeed, it is fundamental to integrate its values with other information to identify complex acid–base disorders.

### Lactic acidosis in sepsis: It's not all anaerobic: implications for diagnosis and management [^114RPu15]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Increased blood lactate concentration (hyperlactatemia) and lactic acidosis (hyperlactatemia and serum pH < 7.35) are common in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In some patients, most of the lactate that is produced in shock states is due to inadequate oxygen delivery resulting in tissue hypoxia and causing anaerobic glycolysis. However, lactate formation during sepsis is not entirely related to tissue hypoxia or reversible by increasing oxygen delivery. In this review, we initially outline the metabolism of lactate and etiology of lactic acidosis; we then address the pathophysiology of lactic acidosis in sepsis. We discuss the clinical implications of serum lactate measurement in diagnosis, monitoring, and prognostication in acute and intensive care settings. Finally, we explore treatment of lactic acidosis and its impact on clinical outcome.

Acute metabolic acidosis is well-recognized in the ICU. However, epidemiological data are scarce, which has limited our understanding of the approach to metabolic acidosis until recently.

A retrospective observational study using a large bi-national ICU database in Australia and New Zealand examined the incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of patients with various definitions of metabolic acidosis. Severe metabolic acidosis was defined as a pH ≤ 7.20, PaCO2 ≤ 45 mmHg, HCO₃⁻ ≤ 20 mmol/l, and total sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score ≥ 4 or lactate ≥ 2 mmol/l and occurred in 1.5% of the patients in the ICU. The ICU and hospital mortality rates of these patients were 43.5% and 48.3%, respectively. Moderate or severe metabolic acidosis was defined as pH < 7.30, base excess < −4 mmol/l and PaCO2 ≤ 45 mmHg, and occurred in 8.4% of ICU patients. The ICU and hospital mortality rates were 17.3% and 21.5%, respectively. The mortality of patients with moderate or severe metabolic acidosis was higher than that of patients with sepsis observed in the same database, suggesting the clinical relevance of improving care for patients with metabolic acidosis.

A French multicenter prospective study described the incidence of severe acidemia in five ICUs. Severe acidemia was defined as pH < 7.2, including respiratory acidosis, metabolic acidosis, and mixed acidosis. This severe acidosis occurred in 8% (200/2550) of the patients within 24 h of ICU admission. After excluding patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is adjudicated to be an entity with a low risk of death, and patients with respiratory acidosis, ICU mortality of patients with metabolic or mixed severe acidosis was as high as 57% (89/155).

A recently published international observational study conducted in 18 ICUs in Australia, Japan, and Taiwan reported that 14% (1292/9437) of critically ill patients had moderate or severe metabolic acidosis. The median incidence of metabolic acidosis at a study ICU was 172.5 patients/year, suggesting that the management of metabolic acidosis is a relevant issue in patient care in the ICU.

Introduction

Metabolic acidosis is a process caused by an increase in weak acids or a decrease in strong ion difference (SID). Serum proteins, albumin, and inorganic phosphate are considered as weak acids. Strong ions, such as Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, and Cl⁻, exist at a fully ionized status in body fluids. SID is the presence of an excess of strong cations over strong anions, and the normal value in plasma is 42 mEq/l. The method to quantify metabolic acidosis using SID and weak acids was introduced by Stewart in the 1980s and still creates debate in its clinical application. Plasma base excess is widely used to identify a metabolic component of acidosis in clinical practice. The base excess approach was shown to be equivalent to Stewart's SID approach in quantifying acid–base status in critically ill patients.

Metabolic acidosis is classified into acute and chronic. Although it is not clearly defined, acute metabolic acidosis occurs within a few days. Chronic acidosis is a condition that lasts for weeks or even years. In this chapter, we focus on acute metabolic acidosis in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and provide an update from recently published clinical studies.

### Severe metabolic or mixed acidemia on intensive care unit admission: incidence, prognosis and administration of buffer therapy. A prospective, multiple-center study [^114LpaWz]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

"Acidemia" can be defined as the accumulation of protons in the plasma which results in a lower blood pH if secondary responses are overwhelmed. In critically ill patients, acidosis is often the result of a combination of single disorders occurring simultaneously that are commonly known collectively as "mixed acid-base disorders".

Although "severe acidemia" is not a universally accepted term, it usually indicates that plasma pH is lower than 7.20. Severe acidemia can be critical, especially when an extremely low pH develops quickly. Clinical manifestations of severe acidemia include cerebral edema, seizures, diaphragm dysfunction, decreased myocardial contractility, pulmonary vasoconstriction and systemic vasodilatation. Acidemia is a potentially life-threatening condition, and previous studies have described the incidence and mechanisms of acidosis occurring in the ICU. Surprisingly, however, these studies failed to focus specifically on severe acidemia. Furthermore, despite the fact that severe acidemia reflects a serious underlying disease that should be treated as soon as possible, the treatment of acidemia by itself with the administration of intravenous buffers remains controversial. Indeed, notwithstanding experts' opinions arguing against treatment with intravenous buffers except in dedicated situations (for example, massive digestive fluid loss during diarrhea or tubular acidosis), 86% of polled US nephrologists indicated that they would prescribe buffers to treat lactic acidosis in patients with a targeted pH above 7.20. Moreover, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggests not treating lactic acidosis when the plasma pH level is above 7.15, but does not give any recommendations for cases where the plasma pH level is below this threshold. To date there have been only two small, prospective, randomized crossover studies assessing the impact of sodium bicarbonate treatment for lactic acidosis on hemodynamic, acid-base and electrolyte changes. Both studies included 24 patients and could not address any difference in terms of morbidity and mortality with regard to whether the patients had first been treated with sodium bicarbonate.

Therefore, we had two aims in our study. First, we sought to describe the incidence of severely metabolic or mixed acidemia patients admitted to the ICU. Second, we wanted to describe the outcomes of patients who had been treated at the onset of acidemia (within the first 24 hours of ICU admission) with intravenous sodium bicarbonate compared with those who had not. We hypothesized that severe acidosis within the 24 first hours after ICU admission is an infrequent phenomenon but that its correction rather than its initial severity is associated with prognosis.

### A case of concurrent metformin-associated lactic acidosis and euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis [^112uedtB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Combination therapy with metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors is strongly recommended for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have inadequate glycemic control. These inhibitors are particularly indicated for patients with a history or high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease. Consequently, the number of patients receiving both metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors is expected to increase. However, these treatments pose a risk of life-threatening acidoses, specifically metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) and euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (euDKA), which require prompt differentiation and distinct treatments.

Case Report

We present the case of a woman in her 50s with chronic heart failure who had been treated for type 2 diabetes for 15 years. After dehydration caused by working in hot conditions and fluid restriction, she presented with dehydration, fatigue, respiratory distress, hypotension, tachypnea, hypothermia, acute renal failure, hypoglycemia, and severe metabolic acidosis. Despite supportive care, lactic acidosis persisted, leading to a diagnosis of MALA. Hemodialysis improved lactate levels, but a persistent anion gap and elevated β-hydroxybutyrate level confirmed euDKA. Metabolic abnormalities resolved with continuous insulin infusion and the patient was discharged without sequelae. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? The combination of MALA and euDKA represents rare but potentially fatal conditions requiring distinct diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. With their growing use for type 2 diabetes management and cardiovascular/kidney benefits, emergency physicians are more likely to encounter complications associated with these medications.

Metabolic acidosis is encountered frequently in intensive care and common causes include lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, or renal failure. We describe a patient presenting to intensive care with a rare cause of metabolic acidosis associated with an increased anion gap: multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. The pathophysiology of this condition is discussed along with potential treatment options.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^1116K34d]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

The present review was written based on a critical and personal appraisal of the literature from 1 January 1980 to 1 December 2014 searched for using the MEDLINE database. The object of the search was the hemodynamic consequences of lactic acidosis during the shock state. The following terms were searched and combined: 'bicarbonate', 'metabolic acidosis', 'lactic acidosis', 'pH', 'shock', 'renal replacement therapy', and 'anion gap acidosis'. In addition, references from each identified article were carefully reviewed for additional suitable references. Studies involving humans or animals were examined, and the search was restricted to articles published in the English language.

This review focuses only on the hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis with appropriate response of the ventilatory system; that is, pH < 7.2, PCO₂ ≤ 42 mmHg and lactatemia > 5 mmol·l⁻¹ (approximation based on the Henderson-Hasselbach equation for PCO₂ = 42 mmHg). The complex association of respiratory and metabolic acidosis is not discussed in this article. Symptomatic therapeutic options are also reviewed. However, other types of metabolic acidosis, such as isolated acute renal failure, bicarbonate-losing metabolic acidosis, ketoacidosis, hyperchloremic acidosis or metformin-induced lactic acidosis, are not addressed, aside from specific comparisons.

### Circulating anions usually associated with the krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis [^114qeCd4]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

The consequences of metabolic acidosis can be catastrophic and a considerable body of literature highlights the poor outlook in patients where lactic acid is the principal component of the acidaemia. This increase in blood lactate concentration reflects either increased lactate production, reduced lactate metabolism or, more commonly, a combination of the two. In patients with DKA, 3-hydroxybutyric acid and, to a lesser extent, acetoacetic acid play the major role in the generation of the anion gap. As outlined, however, in a third patient group, neither lactate nor 3-hydroxybutyrate is responsible for the elevated anion gap and the relevant anions responsible remain unknown. In the fourth patient group, acidosis is generated as a result of uncontrolled electrolyte loss either from the kidney (renal tubular acidosis) or the gut.

We have shown that the plasma concentrations of acids usually associated with the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle are significantly increased in patients with lactic acidosis as well as those with 'unexplained acidosis' with normal or near normal blood lactate concentrations. In DKA, although the concentrations of these acids are less strikingly elevated, they are still abnormal in the majority of patients when compared to controls. They are not, however, significantly elevated in patients with normal anion gap acidosis secondary to excess base loss. The accumulation of such acids may contribute significantly to the production of the anion gap and account, in part, for the 'missing' anions in patients with certain forms of acidosis. Recent studies, in keeping with previous work, have demonstrated the predictive value of acid-base variables on outcome in the critically ill. Furthermore, the calculation of unmeasured anions appears to be a better discriminator of outcome than lactate or base deficit.

### Negative anion gap metabolic acidosis in salicylate overdose – a zebra! [^111FjRKB]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Salicylate poisoning classically results in an increased anion gap metabolic acidosis. We discuss a case of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis despite elevated serum salicylate concentration. This diagnostic dilemma stemmed from aberrant reading of salicylate ions by analyzer electrodes as chloride ions leading to falsely negative anion gap. On review, this phenomenon is found to be possible with a number of commonly used analyzers. In emergency department settings, high level of clinical suspicion for salicylate poisoning should be maintained, and metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap should not be used to rule out salicylate overdose. This can prevent significant avoidable morbidity and mortality.

### Sodium bicarbonate in treating lactic and non-lactic metabolic acidosis at different chloride levels: a retrospective study [^117Kc6Vh]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of alkaline agents to correct acidosis in pediatric patients is common in clinical practice, with sodium bicarbonate being a widely used alkaline drug. However, it is concerning that the results of multi-center randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews suggest that sodium bicarbonate treatment does not improve overall patient survival. Treating metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate in the absence of severe metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.15) not only lacks benefits but may also be harmful.

Chloride plays a crucial role in acid–base balance and metabolism. Plasma pH results from kidney bicarbonate synthesis and excretion of chloride, maintaining the homeostatic balance of the blood CO2/bicarbonate buffer. Bicarbonate deficiency and chloride excess are essentially two sides of the same coin. Theoretically, it is reasonable to assume that sodium bicarbonate treatment could benefit patients with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Promisingly, recent findings of Liu et al. have supported this hypothesis regarding pediatric patients' survival for the first time. They identified that sodium bicarbonate treatment significantly improves the survival rate of metabolic acidosis patients with hyperchloremia (chloride ≥ 113 mmol/L). Still, it increases the risk of death in non-hyperchloremic (chloride < 107 mmol/L) metabolic acidosis patients.

Lactic acidosis is a common form of metabolic acidosis, representing half of all cases. Elevated lactate levels strongly correlate with mortality. Research indicates that mortality rates are twice as high in lactic acidosis cases compared to those without, which has attracted considerable attention from researchers. Therefore, building on the work conducted by Liu et al. this study aimed to analyze the prognosis of pediatric patients treated with sodium bicarbonate and its interaction with chloride levels by classifying them into two subgroups: lactic acidosis and non-lactic acidosis.

### Use of anion gap in the evaluation of a patient with metabolic acidosis [^113JDFth]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

High anion gap (AG) metabolic acidosis, a common laboratory abnormality encountered in clinical practice, frequently is due to accumulation of organic acids such as lactic acid, keto acids, alcohol metabolites, and reduced kidney function. The cause of high AG metabolic acidosis often is established easily using historical and simple laboratory data. Despite this, several challenges in the diagnosis and management of high AG metabolic acidosis remain, including quantifying the increase in AG, understanding the relationship between changes in AG and serum bicarbonate level, and identifying the cause of high AG metabolic acidosis when common causes are ruled out. The present case was selected to highlight the importance of the correction of AG for serum albumin level, the use of actual baseline AG rather than mean normal AG, the relationship between changes in serum bicarbonate level and AG, and a systematic diagnostic approach to uncommon causes of high AG metabolic acidosis, such as 5-oxoproline acidosis (pyroglutamic acidosis).

### Renal tubular acidosis is highly prevalent in critically ill patients [^111kSWbh]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Imbalances of the acid-base state and particularly metabolic acidosis are common problems in critically ill patients. To further investigate the underlying causes, analysis of the acid-base state and determination of plasma and urine electrolytes are crucial. Metabolic acidosis is subdivided in conditions with either high serum anion gap (SAG) or normal SAG according to the classic model of metabolic acid-base disorders. The SAG is the difference in the measured cations (Na +, K +) and anions (Cl −, HCO 3−) in serum.

High SAG is typical for the occurrence of unmeasured anions (for example ketones, lactate, metabolites of methanol and ethylene glycol, phosphate) where HCO 3− is consumed via its action as a buffer. High SAG metabolic acidosis is seen in ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, intoxication and acute renal failure.

Metabolic acidosis with normal SAG - hyperchloremic acidosis - is characterized by the replacement of bicarbonate with chloride caused by extrarenal or renal bicarbonate disposal or a dysfunction in renal H + secretion. Hyperchloremic acidosis is typically seen in bicarbonate wasting due to diarrhea, urine-gut diversions, intestinal or pancreatic fistulae, surgical drains or renal tubular acidosis (RTA).

The analysis of the urine osmolal gap (UOG) is necessary to further differentiate these conditions. The UOG represents the difference of the directly measured urine osmolality to an estimate of the urine osmolality derived from the urine concentrations of sodium, potassium, urea nitrogen, and glucose concentrations.

A UOG - as an approximate measure of unmeasured urine ammonium salts - of less than 150 mosmol/kg in combination with a preserved renal function is characteristic for altered urine acidification typical for RTA, while a UOG of more than 150 mosmol/kg suggests extrarenal bicarbonate loss.

### Zonisamide (Zonisade) [^1169N7mt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Metabolic Acidosis

Zonisamide causes hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to the inhibitory effect of zonisamide on carbonic anhydrase. Generally, zonisamide-induced metabolic acidosis occurs early in treatment, but it can develop at any time during treatment. Metabolic acidosis generally appears dose-dependent and can occur at doses as low as 25 mg daily.

Conditions or therapies that predispose to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of zonisamide.

Some manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae including cardiac arrhythmias or stupor. Chronic, untreated, metabolic acidosis may increase the risk for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. Nephrolithiasis has been observed in the clinical development program in 4% of adults treated with zonisamide, has also been detected by renal ultrasound in 8% of pediatric treated patients who had at least one ultrasound prospectively collected, and was reported as an adverse event in 3% (4/133) of pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)]. Metabolic acidosis can also increase the risk for hyperammonemia, particularly in the presence of drugs which can cause hyperammonemia.

### Randomized, controlled trial of TRC101 to increase serum bicarbonate in patients with CKD [^111zv5vY]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Metabolic acidosis is common in patients with CKD and has significant adverse effects on kidney, muscle, and bone. We tested the efficacy and safety of TRC101, a novel, sodium-free, nonabsorbed hydrochloric acid binder, to increase serum bicarbonate in patients with CKD and metabolic acidosis.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

One hundred thirty-five patients were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, in-unit study (designated the TRCA-101 Study). Patients had a mean baseline eGFR of 35 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, a mean baseline serum bicarbonate of 17.7 mEq/L, and comorbidities, including hypertension (93%), diabetes (70%), and heart failure (21%). Patients ate a controlled diet and were treated for 14 days with placebo or one of four TRC101 dosing regimens (1.5, 3, or 4.5 g twice daily or 6 g once daily). After treatment, patients were discharged and followed for 7–14 days.

Results

All TRC101 treatment groups had a mean within-group increase in serum bicarbonate of ≥ 1.3 mEq/L (P < 0.001) within 72 hours of the first dose and a mean increase in serum bicarbonate of 3.2–3.9 mEq/L (P < 0.001) at the end of treatment compared with placebo, in which serum bicarbonate did not change. In the combined TRC101 treatment group, serum bicarbonate was normalized (22–29 mEq/L) at the end of treatment in 35% of patients and increased by ≥ 4 mEq/L in 39% of patients. After discontinuation of TRC101, serum bicarbonate decreased nearly to baseline levels within 2 weeks. All adverse events were mild or moderate, with gastrointestinal events most common. All patients completed the study.

Conclusions

TRC101 safely and significantly increased the level of serum bicarbonate in patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD.

### Metabolic acidosis and the progression of chronic kidney disease [^113HJS1L]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology leading to acidosis in CKD

Under normal conditions, the extracellular H + concentration is tightly regulated and varies little from the normal value of approximately 40 nanomol/L. Regulation of acid–base homeostasis involves three basic steps: chemical buffering by extracellular and intracellular buffers, alteration of alveolar ventilation, and changes in renal H + excretion. The kidneys regulate H + excretion by reabsorbing filtered HCO 3 − and generating new HCO 3 − in response to various stimuli. Secreted H⁺ combine with urinary buffers such as HPO₄²⁻ and ammonia. In CKD the reduction in functioning nephrons causes defects in renal excretion of acid, mainly in the form of ammonium. A fraction of patients may have inappropriate bicarbonate wasting in the urine.

The acidosis in CKD usually remains relatively stable. In uncomplicated acidosis, the serum bicarbonate levels typically are > 12 mEq/L and blood pH is > 7.2. There are two general possibilities for this stabilization of serum bicarbonate levels. One is that after an initial period of acid retention, the excretion and production of acid equalize. The other possibility is that acidosis evokes extrarenal mechanisms that dispose of the endogenous acid not excreted in the urine. The major source of such buffering would be base derived from bone. Carefully conducted balance studies in CKD patients with acidosis found a positive acid balance of approximately 10–20 mEq per day and negative calcium balance that improved with correction of acidosis. However, the degree of acid retention has been debated, with the suggestion that these findings resulted from systematic measurement error. While the magnitude of acid retention may be less than reported, it seems likely that acid production does exceed excretion in the setting of chronic renal acidosis.

The acidosis in mild to moderate CKD is predominantly hyperchloremic, with an increased anion gap observed variably and generally only with advanced CKD. However, accounting for changes in serum albumin and other electrolytes in the anion gap calculation reveals a slightly more nuanced view. This maneuver reveals minor elevations in the anion gap, which are associated with decrements in serum bicarbonate, even in the CKD stage 2 eGFR range. Although small, these differences in anion gap are independently associated with mortality. Thus, there may be low-level accumulation of organic solutes even when the GFR is relatively preserved that partially accounts for changes in the serum bicarbonate level.

### Topiramate (eprontia) [^117DDyR5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

EPRONTIA can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by EPRONTIA. EPRONTIA induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of EPRONTIA.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with topiramate in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to ≤ 2% for placebo.

Topiramate can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by topiramate. Topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of topiramate.

### Association between early metabolic acidosis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia / death in preterm infants born at less than 28 weeks' gestation: an observational cohort study [^111FN6Bj]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common and serious chronic respiratory disease in preterm infants. Extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGAN), those born before 28 completed weeks of gestational age, are in particular at high-risk of developing BPD. Despite improved survival in extremely preterm infants and advances in neonatal care, the number of infants with BPD has steadily increased. The pathogenesis of BPD is multifactorial and attributed to impaired alveolar and vascular development. Intrauterine growth restriction and infections, gestational age, birth weight, male sex, and mechanical ventilation are among the important risk factors for developing BPD. BPD is associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes throughout childhood and causes relevant health care utilization and costs.

Metabolic acidosis in the first days after birth is common in ELGAN. Metabolic acidosis has a multifactorial etiology. Renal immaturity, parenteral nutrition, protein metabolism, medication, respiratory failure, hemodynamic disturbances, and hypovolemia influence acid-base homeostasis in extremely preterm infants. In particular, renal tubular immaturity is characterized by a lower renal bicarbonate threshold, leading to increased urinary bicarbonate losses and a reduced urinary excretion of ammonium and titratable acids. In addition, high chloride levels are associated with the development of metabolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis in ELGAN is self-limiting and resolves within the second week of life, in parallel with a renal maturation process during this period.

The management of metabolic acidosis in preterm infants can be challenging. Metabolic acidosis has been described as a risk factor for intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants and has been associated with longer hospitalization and a poorer neurological outcome in very low birth weight infants. Whether or at what threshold metabolic acidosis needs to be treated at all is still controversial. Sodium bicarbonate is routinely used in preterm infants despite evidence of increased rates of intraventricular hemorrhage and mortality. Alternatively, sodium acetate can be used to correct metabolic acidosis.

Results from recent studies may indicate a link between metabolic acidosis and the development of BPD. Lower minimum pH values during the first 14 postnatal days have been associated with the development in BPD in premature infants < 32 weeks of gestational age. In addition, the administration of sodium acetate instead of sodium chloride in parenteral nutrition has been shown to reduce the frequency of metabolic acidosis and BPD in preterm infants.

The objective of this study was to investigate the association between metabolic acidosis during the first two postnatal weeks and BPD and/or mortality in ELGAN. The underlying null hypothesis was that infants with metabolic acidosis during the first 14 days of life would not have a higher incidence of BPD/death.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^1151jCXe]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, as a retrospective study, our database is limited to the variables that were collected for clinical management, and some patients with metabolic acidosis may have been excluded because of missing data. However, these were the data available to clinicians and our study demonstrates that a significant number of patients suspected of having lactic acidosis clinically do in fact have other forms of metabolic acidosis. Second, we could not control for severity of illness between groups. Severity of illness scores (for example Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)) were recorded only on admission to ICU and only in a subset of patients. Several patients had their highest lactate levels several days into their stay in ICU. However, the use of severity of illness scores are potentially misleading because metabolic acidosis itself might lead to worsening disease severity. Indeed, most severity scoring systems take into account acid–base variables and/or lactate. Thus, for our model we included age as covariate. We also report the admission diagnostic category in Table 2. The nature of our database (laboratory values) also limited our logistic regression model. Ideally we would have included treatment variables (saline and other resuscitation fluid) as well as other clinical variables (hemodynamics). Another limitation involved our initial selection process. The 'suspicion of lactic acidosis' excluded several patients in whom a metabolic acidosis may have been present for other reasons but was not suspected. The categories of metabolic acidosis were used to describe the predominating anion. Rather than using an arbitrary definition of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis that relies on an absolute value of chloride, we first eliminated all other causes of what has been traditionally classified as an anion gap metabolic acidosis (SIG or lactate). Our classification scheme leaves open the possibility that a combined lactic/SIG acidosis would have been misclassified as hyperchloremic. Conversely, some hyperchloremic cases could have been misclassified as either SIG or lactic acidosis if pre-existing or concomitant metabolic alkalosis was also present, decreasing the apparent impact of chloride. However, these limitations exist with any acid–base classification scheme and given that hyperchloremic acidosis is defined on the basis of 'acidosis without an AG', rather than on the basis of chloride levels, some imprecision is always going to be present.

### Sodium bicarbonate [^112wKKwe]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Sodium Bicarbonate Injection is indicated in the treatment of metabolic acidosis which may occur in severe renal disease, uncontrolled diabetes, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, extracorporeal circulation of blood, cardiac arrest and severe primary lactic acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate is further indicated in the treatment of certain drug intoxications, including barbiturates (where dissociation of the barbiturate-protein complex is desired), in poisoning by salicylates or methyl alcohol and in hemolytic reactions requiring alkalinization of the urine to diminish nephrotoxicity of hemoglobin and its breakdown products. Sodium bicarbonate also is indicated in severe diarrhea which is often accompanied by a significant loss of bicarbonate.

Treatment of metabolic acidosis should, if possible, be superimposed on measures designed to control the basic cause of the acidosis – e.g., insulin in uncomplicated diabetes, blood volume restoration in shock. But since an appreciable time interval may elapse before all of the ancillary effects are brought about, bicarbonate therapy is indicated to minimize risks inherent to the acidosis itself.

Vigorous bicarbonate therapy is required in any form of metabolic acidosis where a rapid increase in plasma total CO2content is crucial – e.g., cardiac arrest, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, and in severe primary lactic acidosis or severe diabetic acidosis.

But since an appreciable time interval may elapse before all of the ancillary effects are brought about, bicarbonate therapy is indicated to minimize risks inherent to the acidosis itself.

Vigorous bicarbonate therapy is required in any form of metabolic acidosis where a rapid increase in plasma total C02 content is crucial - e.g., cardiac arrest, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, and in severe primary lactic acidosis or severe diabetic acidosis.

### Management of acute metabolic acidosis in the ICU: sodium bicarbonate and renal replacement therapy [^1117ueGb]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

In a retrospective, observational study using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database, sodium bicarbonate administration was not associated with improved survival in patients with metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.3, HCO3 − < 20 mmol/l and PaCO2 < 50 mmHg) but was associated with improved survival in septic patients with stage 2 or 3 AKI and severe acidemia (pH < 7.2).

A recent international observational study revealed that 18% of patients with moderate or severe metabolic acidosis receive sodium bicarbonate in current clinical practice. However, the total amount of sodium bicarbonate given during the first 24 h of metabolic acidosis was 110 mmol, which was not adjusted for body weight or base excess. The study also reported that sodium bicarbonate administration was possibly associated with lower ICU mortality in acidotic patients with vasopressor dependency, albeit with a lack of statistical significance. Given that the rationale to use sodium bicarbonate would be to support cardiovascular function, this finding provides a sound basis for further investigation on the effect of sodium bicarbonate in patients with metabolic acidosis and on vasopressors.

### Is lactic acidosis a cause of exercise induced hyperventilation at the respiratory compensation point? [^1161d7cG]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

The respiratory compensation point (RCP) marks the onset of hyperventilation ("respiratory compensation") during incremental exercise. Its physiological meaning has not yet been definitely determined, but the most common explanation is a failure of the body's buffering mechanisms which leads to metabolic (lactic) acidosis. It was intended to test this experimentally.

Methods

During a first ramp-like exercise test on a cycle ergometer, RCP (range: 2.51–3.73 l x min(-1) oxygen uptake) was determined from gas exchange measurements in five healthy subjects (age 26–42; body mass index (BMI) 20.7–23.9 kg x m(-2); Vo(2peak) 51.3–62.1 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1)). On the basis of simultaneous determinations of blood pH and base excess, the necessary amount of bicarbonate to completely buffer the metabolic acidosis was calculated. This quantity was administered intravenously in small doses during a second, otherwise identical, exercise test.

Results

In each subject sufficient compensation for the acidosis, that is, a pH value constantly above 7.37, was attained during the second test. A delay but no disappearance of the hyperventilation was present in all participants when compared with the first test. RCP occurred on average at a significantly (p = 0.043) higher oxygen uptake (+0.15 l x min(-1)) compared with the first test.

Conclusions

For the first time it was directly demonstrated that exercise induced lactic acidosis is causally involved in the hyperventilation which starts at RCP. However, it does not represent the only additional stimulus of ventilation during intense exercise. Muscle afferents and other sensory inputs from exercising muscles are alternative triggering mechanisms.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^114VCcKX]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Overall, hyperchloremic acidosis was associated with mortality similar to that of the non-acidotic group (29% versus 26%; p = NS). This is perhaps a reassuring finding because many cases of hyperchloremic acidosis are iatrogenic – due to the administration of saline-based intravenous fluids – and can mostly be avoided by resuscitating with a more balanced solution such as lactated Ringer's. However, our methods do not permit us to disentangle the potentially adverse effects of saline-induced acidosis from the potential advantages of fluid administration. Indeed, given that our cohort was that of suspected lactic acidosis, fluid administration might have reversed shock in some patients at the expense of hyperchloremic acidosis. In this way, saline resuscitation might also have converted some patients with hypoperfusion-induced lactic acidosis into hyperchloremia. Against this hypothesis are numerous observations that lactic acidosis in ICU patients usually does not reflect hypoperfusion. However, we did not exclude patients whose worst ABG was drawn before ICU admission (though only patients admitted to the ICU were included) and thus our cohort may have included some patients with shock and lactic acidosis and other patients with saline-induced acidosis after resuscitation. Our database does not permit us to test this hypothesis directly and furthermore our sample size, although relatively large, is still insufficient to exclude a clinically significant effect of hyperchloremia on mortality. It is important to keep in mind that chloride is a strong anion and, with regards to plasma, the addition of normal saline increases the value from baseline of chloride more than that of sodium. This change in the ratio of sodium to chloride is what is important. The increase in chloride relative to that of sodium decreases SID, resulting in a decrease in the alkalinity of blood. In this sense, chloride must always be interpreted with the sodium level because they both change with regard to the patient's volume status and the composition of intravenous fluids.
