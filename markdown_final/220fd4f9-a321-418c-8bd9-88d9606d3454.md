## Question

Screening for vitamin d deficiency

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to screen for vitamin D deficiency, when not to screen, how to interpret results, and how to manage identified deficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence base and guideline consensus. Then, I should verify the scope and key exclusions. Next, I will examine the evidence gaps that drive the "insufficient evidence" conclusion. After that, I should review assay limitations and definitional uncertainty. Then, I will identify high-risk subgroups where targeted testing is reasonable despite the general recommendation. I will also consider special populations like pregnancy, older adults, and chronic disease. Finally, I will outline interpretation thresholds, treatment strategies, and a practical clinical algorithm, making sure I double-check areas of controversy and correct any outdated assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the core recommendation and its credibility. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issues an I statement for screening asymptomatic, community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults, concluding that the balance of benefits and harms of screening cannot be determined from current evidence, and this position is echoed by the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Society for Clinical Pathology, which advise against routine population screening [^111UJRQk] [^113LbYKt] [^112a2CfF].

> Wait, let me verify the scope so I don't overgeneralize. This applies to asymptomatic, community-dwelling adults without conditions for which vitamin D treatment is already indicated; it does not apply to institutionalized persons, inpatients, or those with signs/symptoms or established indications for testing, and it is distinct from USPSTF recommendations on vitamin D supplementation for primary prevention of falls, fractures, or cardiometabolic disease, which address supplementation without prior screening [^111QhBPH] [^112SRjcj].

> I need to check the evidentiary basis for the I statement. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — does any trial show that screening improves outcomes? No direct trials compare screening versus no screening, and among asymptomatic community-dwelling adults with low 25(OH)D, treatment does not improve mortality, fractures, diabetes, cardiovascular events, cancer, depression, or falls, with pooled analyses showing null effects across these outcomes, which undermines a screening strategy that presumes benefit from early detection and treatment [^113eufYa] [^114TynPS] [^116GMwd2].

> Next, I should review assay and definitional issues that erode confidence in screening. Total 25(OH)D is the best available marker, but results vary by method and between laboratories; LC-MS/MS is the reference method, yet standardization remains imperfect despite the Vitamin D Standardization Program, and there is no consensus cutpoint defining deficiency across clinical outcomes, with the IOM anchoring sufficiency at 20 ng/mL for bone health while acknowledging uncertainty for extraskeletal outcomes, and the Endocrine Society's 2011 thresholds have been superseded by 2024 guidance that no longer endorses fixed numeric targets for sufficiency [^113SWNpu] [^1159T71R] [^1128upyg] [^11535HZz].

> Let me consider who might still warrant targeted testing despite the general recommendation. I should confirm risk factors repeatedly cited: obesity, older age, limited UVB exposure (dark complexion, high latitude, winter, indoor lifestyle), low dietary intake, malabsorption, chronic liver/kidney disease, and medications that accelerate catabolism; these factors increase prevalence and plausibility of clinically relevant deficiency, though the clinical significance of low levels in some subgroups remains uncertain and testing should be individualized [^1173FY29] [^1157dBB6] [^111tPxE5].

> But wait, what about pregnancy — this is often contentious. ACOG states evidence is insufficient to recommend universal screening, while allowing consideration of testing in those at increased risk; ASPEN highlights maternal deficiency as a neonatal risk and supports considering screening in pregnancy; the Endocrine Society's 2024 guideline advises against routine 25(OH)D testing during pregnancy, favoring empiric supplementation strategies in many cases; and bariatric pregnancy guidance recommends trimester-based nutritional surveillance including vitamin D, reflecting a higher-risk context where testing may be reasonable [^116mapQP] [^114ffNc6] [^114YjBqz] [^112bNuE3] [^112P96FT] [^116BQp8j].

> I should double-check older adults. The USPSTF found no benefit of screening asymptomatic older adults and no benefit of treatment on mortality, fractures, or falls in screen-detected deficiency, while the Endocrine Society suggests against routine testing in adults aged 75 years and older, noting that outcome-specific benefit thresholds have not been established; however, a very small mortality signal with vitamin D in adults over 75 has been observed in recent syntheses, which supports empiric supplementation in some older adults rather than screening to guide treatment [^114TynPS] [^116VpLes] [^117Va2Uq].

> Let me review chronic disease contexts where testing is commonly pursued. In inflammatory bowel disease on corticosteroids or with suspected deficiency, ESPEN recommends monitoring 25(OH)D; in cystic fibrosis, annual 25(OH)D testing is standard due to high deficiency rates and bone health risks; in chronic liver disease, expert reviews endorse screening in hepatic failure and broader fat-soluble vitamin assessment in cholestatic disease; and in prediabetes, vitamin D may modestly reduce progression to diabetes, though routine screening is not advised and empiric supplementation may be considered in selected patients [^1157dBB6] [^115B3zQ9] [^111tPxE5] [^117Va2Uq].

> Hold on, I should verify how to interpret results if testing is done. Severe deficiency is commonly operationalized at < 12 ng/mL, deficiency at < 20 ng/mL, and insufficiency at 21–29 ng/mL, but I must emphasize that these thresholds are outcome- and guideline-dependent and that the Endocrine Society no longer endorses universal numeric targets; interpretation should be anchored to clinical context, seasonality, and the assay used, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D should not be used to assess vitamin D status except in specific disorders of vitamin D metabolism [^115TEChd] [^11535HZz] [^111vVZHD].

> Next, I should review treatment principles and correct an outdated assumption. I initially thought maintaining levels above 30 ng/mL was a universal target, but wait, the 2024 Endocrine Society guideline explicitly withdraws endorsement of a 30 ng/mL target and emphasizes that outcome-specific benefit thresholds have not been established; treatment should be individualized, with typical repletion using cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol, often 50,000 IU weekly for 6–8 weeks followed by maintenance at 800–2,000 IU daily, while recognizing that higher daily doses may be needed in obesity or malabsorption and that intermittent high-dose regimens may increase falls in older adults [^11535HZz] [^111tPxE5] [^1114js6Q] [^117Va2Uq].

> I need to ensure I address potential harms and costs. Screening itself has minimal direct harm but may lead to misclassification and overtreatment; treatment is generally safe at usual doses, with toxicity rare and typically associated with 25(OH)D levels above 150 ng/mL; nonetheless, population screening would entail substantial costs and effort without proven outcome benefit, and feasibility and equity impacts remain uncertain [^113MKBT4] [^112hWsEs] [^111DBJdp].

> Let me synthesize a practical clinical approach. For generally healthy, asymptomatic adults, do not screen; instead, use risk-based clinical judgment and consider empiric supplementation in groups with plausible benefit such as older adults, those with limited sun exposure or darker complexion, and individuals with obesity, while avoiding routine testing in these groups unless there is a specific indication; reserve 25(OH)D testing for patients with signs/symptoms of deficiency, metabolic bone disease, malabsorption, chronic liver or kidney disease, certain medications, or special populations like pregnancy after bariatric surgery or cystic fibrosis, and if testing is pursued, interpret results with attention to assay variability and clinical context rather than rigid thresholds [^111DBJdp] [^113VHJ8R] [^1114js6Q] [^1126dgNJ].

> Finally, I should confirm the bottom line and reconcile differing guidance. The USPSTF's I statement reflects the absence of direct screening trials and the lack of demonstrated outcome benefit from treating screen-detected deficiency, while specialty societies converge on avoiding routine screening in healthy adults and instead targeting testing to those at higher risk or with established indications; where uncertainty persists, shared decision-making that weighs individual risk, values, and the limited incremental value of a 25(OH)D level is prudent [^111UJRQk] [^111DBJdp] [^113hNi1n].

---

Routine screening for vitamin D deficiency is **not recommended** for the general population [^111UJRQk] because evidence does not show that screening improves clinical outcomes [^113eufYa] and testing can lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment [^113MKBT4] [^111ByWWk]. Targeted testing is appropriate for high-risk groups — older adults, people with limited sun exposure, dark skin, obesity, chronic liver or kidney disease, malabsorption, or those on medications that affect vitamin D metabolism [^1173FY29] [^113LbYKt]. Universal screening is not advised in pregnancy [^112P96FT] or older adults [^112DV3AJ] [^113TnwPf] unless specific risk factors are present. If deficiency is confirmed, treat with vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and monitor 25(OH)D levels to guide therapy [^notfound].

---

## Evidence and guidelines regarding screening

The USPSTF concludes that evidence is **insufficient** to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults [^111UJRQk] [^1172jHhK]. This conclusion is based on the lack of direct evidence that screening improves clinical outcomes, such as fracture prevention, fall reduction, or improved physical function [^113eufYa] [^114TynPS]. The Endocrine Society and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) similarly **do not recommend routine screening** for vitamin D deficiency in the general population [^113LbYKt] [^112P96FT] [^116mapQP]. They advise targeted testing only for individuals at high risk or with specific clinical indications [^113LbYKt] [^113VHJ8R].

---

## Populations at risk for vitamin D deficiency

While routine screening is not recommended, certain populations are at **increased risk** for vitamin D deficiency and may benefit from targeted testing:

- **Older adults**: Age-related decline in skin synthesis of vitamin D and reduced dietary intake increase deficiency risk [^1173FY29].
- **Individuals with limited sun exposure**: Those living at high latitudes, with indoor lifestyles, or who consistently use sunscreen have lower vitamin D synthesis [^1173FY29].
- **Individuals with dark skin pigmentation**: Higher melanin levels reduce cutaneous vitamin D synthesis [^1173FY29].
- **Individuals with obesity**: Vitamin D sequestration in adipose tissue lowers circulating 25(OH)D levels [^1173FY29].
- **Individuals with chronic liver or kidney disease**: Impaired hydroxylation of vitamin D reduces active vitamin D levels [^111tPxE5].
- **Individuals with malabsorption syndromes**: Conditions such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and cystic fibrosis impair vitamin D absorption [^115B3zQ9].
- **Individuals on medications affecting vitamin D metabolism**: Glucocorticoids, anticonvulsants, and certain antifungal agents can increase vitamin D catabolism [^notfound].

---

## Clinical indications for vitamin D testing

Vitamin D testing is **recommended** in specific clinical scenarios, including:

- **Musculoskeletal symptoms**: Bone pain, muscle weakness, or unexplained fractures may indicate vitamin D deficiency [^1149Fjct].
- **Metabolic bone diseases**: Osteomalacia, osteoporosis, or hyperparathyroidism warrant vitamin D status assessment [^111ByWWk].
- **Hypocalcemia**: Low serum calcium levels may result from vitamin D deficiency [^113VHJ8R].
- **Chronic liver or kidney disease**: These conditions impair vitamin D metabolism and necessitate monitoring [^111tPxE5].
- **Malabsorption syndromes**: Clinical suspicion or diagnosis of malabsorption warrants vitamin D testing [^notfound].

---

## Methods of screening and diagnosis

The **primary biomarker** for assessing vitamin D status is serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] [^114xwr92]. This form reflects both dietary intake and cutaneous synthesis and has a half-life of approximately three weeks, making it the most stable and reliable indicator of vitamin D status [^1128upyg]. Laboratory methods for measuring 25(OH)D include immunoassays, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and radioimmunoassays. LC-MS/MS is considered the **reference method** due to its accuracy and reliability, although it is not universally available [^113SWNpu] [^114W96ke].

---

## Definition of vitamin D deficiency

There is ongoing debate regarding the **definition of vitamin D deficiency**. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) defines deficiency as serum 25(OH)D levels below 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), which covers the requirements of at least 97.5% of the population [^1128upyg]. The Endocrine Society previously defined deficiency as levels below 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) and insufficiency as 21–29 ng/mL (52.5–72.5 nmol/L) [^115TEChd]. However, recent guidelines from the Endocrine Society (2024) **no longer endorse specific 25(OH)D thresholds** due to lack of clinical trial evidence supporting distinct cutoffs tied to outcome-specific benefits [^11535HZz].

---

## Potential benefits and harms of screening

### Benefits

Potential benefits of screening include **early detection** of deficiency, enabling timely intervention to prevent musculoskeletal complications such as osteomalacia, osteoporosis, and fractures [^116pPHVn]. Screening may also identify individuals at risk for falls, although evidence for fall prevention through screening alone is limited [^113eufYa].

---

### Harms

Screening may lead to **overdiagnosis and overtreatment**, as low 25(OH)D levels may not necessarily indicate clinical deficiency or require intervention [^113MKBT4]. Unnecessary supplementation can result in hypercalcemia, kidney stones, and increased healthcare costs [^113MKBT4]. Additionally, variability in assay performance and lack of standardization may result in misclassification of vitamin D status [^113MKBT4].

---

## Clinical management of identified deficiency

When vitamin D deficiency is identified, **management typically includes**:

- **Vitamin D supplementation**: Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is the preferred form due to its superior pharmacokinetic properties and sustained elevation of 25(OH)D levels [^notfound].
- **Dosing regimens**: Initial high-dose regimens (e.g. 50,000 IU weekly for 6–8 weeks) followed by maintenance therapy (800–2,000 IU daily) are commonly recommended [^111tPxE5].
- **Monitoring**: Serum 25(OH)D levels should be monitored to assess treatment response and adjust dosing accordingly [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

### Pregnancy

Routine screening for vitamin D deficiency is **not recommended** during pregnancy [^112P96FT]. However, supplementation is generally advised to support maternal and fetal bone health, with typical doses ranging from 600–2,000 IU daily [^1114js6Q] [^114Hfpqn] [^114u8Lh2].

---

### Older adults

Routine screening is **not recommended** for older adults, but supplementation may be considered to reduce the risk of falls and fractures, particularly in institutionalized or frail populations [^116VpLes] [^115Jf2jH].

---

### Individuals with chronic diseases

Patients with chronic liver or kidney disease, malabsorption syndromes, or those on medications affecting vitamin D metabolism may **require individualized assessment and monitoring** of vitamin D status [^111tPxE5] [^1157dBB6].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine screening for vitamin D deficiency is **not recommended** for the general population due to insufficient evidence of benefit and potential harms from overdiagnosis and overtreatment [^112abct4]. Targeted testing is appropriate for high-risk individuals and those with specific clinical indications. When deficiency is identified, evidence-based supplementation and monitoring strategies should be employed to optimize clinical outcomes [^114gUrCM].

Description

New USPSTF recommendation on screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for and treatment of vitamin D deficiency, including the benefits and harms of screening and early treatment.

Population

This recommendation applies to community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults aged 18 years or older who are seen in primary care settings and are not known to have signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults. (I statement).

---

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111UJRQk]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that performs an important role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism and also affects many other cellular regulatory functions outside the skeletal system. Vitamin D requirements may vary by individual; thus, no one serum vitamin D level cutpoint defines deficiency, and no consensus exists regarding the precise serum levels of vitamin D that represent optimal health or sufficiency.

Objective

To update its 2014 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on screening for vitamin D deficiency, including the benefits and harms of screening and early treatment.

Population

Community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults who have no signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes that the overall evidence on the benefits of screening for vitamin D deficiency is lacking. Therefore, the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults. (I statement).

### Should we screen for vitamin D deficiency? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^113hNi1n]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently issued guidelines on screening for vitamin D deficiency. The guidelines were based on randomized trials of vitamin D deficiency screening and treatment, as well as on case-control studies nested within the Women's Health Initiative. The USPSTF concluded that current evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults. Compared with placebo or no treatment, vitamin D was associated with decreased mortality; however, benefits were no longer seen after trials of institutionalized persons were excluded. Vitamin D treatment was associated with a possible decreased risk for at least 1 fall and the total number of falls per person but not for fractures. None of the studies examined the effects of vitamin D screening versus not screening on clinical outcomes. In this Grand Rounds, 2 prominent endocrinologists debate the issue of screening for vitamin D deficiency in a 55-year-old, asymptomatic, postmenopausal woman. They review the data on which the USPSTF recommendations are based and discuss the potential benefits and risks, as well as the challenges and controversies, of screening for vitamin D deficiency in primary care practice.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111QhBPH]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) vitamin D deficiency screening — scope clarifications state that this recommendation focuses on screening for vitamin D deficiency and that separate recommendations address vitamin D supplementation; it applies to asymptomatic, community-dwelling adults, does not apply to persons in institutional or hospital settings who may have underlying or concurrent conditions that warrant vitamin D testing or treatment, and did not review the evidence on COVID-19 and vitamin D.

---

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1173FY29]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Assessment of risk for low vitamin D in adults notes that although evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against screening, several factors are associated with lower vitamin D levels, including low dietary vitamin D intake, little or no UV B exposure (eg, winter season, high latitude, or sun avoidance), older age, and obesity, which is associated with lower 25(OH)D levels. People who are obese have a 1.3- to 2-fold increased risk of being vitamin D-deficient depending on the threshold used to define deficiency, and depending on the serum threshold used, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is 2 to 10 times higher in non-Hispanic Black persons than in non-Hispanic White persons. These prevalence estimates are based on total 25(OH)D levels, controversy remains about whether this is the best measure of vitamin D status among different racial and ethnic groups, and a significant proportion of the variability in 25(OH)D levels among individuals is not explained by the risk factors noted.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115TEChd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to definitions, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to define vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency according to the level of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D as follows:

- deficiency: < 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L)

- insufficiency: 21–29 ng/mL (52.5–72.5 nmol/L).

---

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114gUrCM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to provide guidelines to clinicians for the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency with an emphasis on the care of patients who are at risk for deficiency.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a Chair, six additional experts, and a methodologist. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during several conference calls and e-mail communications. The draft prepared by the Task Force was reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical Affairs Core Committee, and cosponsoring associations, and it was posted on The Endocrine Society web site for member review. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

Conclusions

Considering that vitamin D deficiency is very common in all age groups and that few foods contain vitamin D, the Task Force recommended supplementation at suggested daily intake and tolerable upper limit levels, depending on age and clinical circumstances. The Task Force also suggested the measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test in patients at risk for deficiency. Treatment with either vitamin D(2) or vitamin D(3) was recommended for deficient patients. At the present time, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend screening individuals who are not at risk for deficiency or to prescribe vitamin D to attain the noncalcemic benefit for cardiovascular protection.

### Low vitamin D status: definition, prevalence, consequences, and correction [^116pPHVn]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Low vitamin D status is extremely common worldwide due to low dietary intake and low skin production. Suboptimal vitamin D status contributes to many conditions, including osteomalacia/rickets, osteoporosis, falls, and fractures. It is possible or even likely that low vitamin D status increases risk for a multitude of other conditions. Although consensus does not exist, it appears that circulating 25(OH)D concentrations greater than 30 to 32 ng/mL are needed for optimal health. To achieve this, daily intakes of at least 1000 IU of D3 daily are required, and it is probable that substantially higher amounts are required to achieve such values on a population basis. It seems premature to recommend widespread screening for 25(OH)D measurement. Targeted measurement in those at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency and those most likely to have a prompt positive response to supplementation is appropriate. Widespread optimization of vitamin D status likely will lead to prevention of many diseases with attendant reduction of morbidity, mortality, and expense.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113SWNpu]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Supporting evidence — scope of review and accuracy of screening tests: To update its 2014 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review focused on asymptomatic, community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults 18 years or older seen in primary care who do not have clinical signs of vitamin D deficiency or conditions that could cause it or for which treatment is recommended; total 25(OH)D can be measured by both binding and chemical assays, but serum total 25(OH)D levels are difficult to measure accurately, LC-MS/MS is considered the reference assay yet is complicated and subject to variation and error, and in 2010 the Vitamin D Standardization Program was initiated to promote standardized 25(OH)D measurement, with most trials reviewed predating this program.

---

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116GMwd2]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF rationale — evidence and harms for adult screening explains that total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels are currently considered the best marker of vitamin D status, yet levels are difficult to measure accurately and results vary by testing method and between laboratories using the same testing methods. There is no direct evidence on the benefits of screening for vitamin D deficiency, and adequate evidence shows that treatment of asymptomatic vitamin D deficiency has no benefit on mortality, risk for fractures in persons selected solely on the basis of low vitamin D levels or incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, while evidence on other outcomes remains inadequate. Regarding harms, there is no direct evidence on the harms of screening, and adequate evidence indicates that the harms of treatment of vitamin D deficiency are small to none. Overall, the evidence on the benefits of screening is lacking; therefore, the balance of benefits and harms in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1159T71R]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Vitamin D levels and population prevalence — The document states that "no one serum vitamin D level cutpoint defines deficiency, and no consensus exists regarding the precise serum levels of vitamin D that represent optimal health or sufficiency". It reports that "an estimated 97.5% of the population will have their vitamin D needs met at a serum level of 20 ng/mL (49.9 nmol/L) and risk for deficiency, relative to bone health, begins to occur at levels less than 12 to 20 ng/mL (29.9–49.9 nmol/L)". Additionally, a report based on 2014 survey data found that 5% of persons 1 year or older had very low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels (< 12 ng/mL) and 18% had levels between 12 and 19 ng/mL.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115GCzBc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Screening for low vitamin D status with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) testing — definitions and utilization: Vitamin D deficiency is traditionally defined clinically as having symptoms and signs of rickets or osteomalacia, but prevalence estimates vary by laboratory threshold; if defined as 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL (50.0 nmol/L), 24% of US adults meet the criterion, whereas if defined as < 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/L), 6% of US adults would be considered vitamin D–deficient. Test utilization has risen, with 25(OH)D testing increasing from 0.29 per 1000 person-years at risk (95% CI, 0.27–0.31) in 2008 to 1.61 per 1000 person-years at risk (95% CI, 1.59–1.62) in 2015; the panel prioritized 3 clinical questions related to screening thresholds and whether treatment should be limited to individuals below a threshold.

Potential harms — screening and treatment considerations: Screening may misclassify persons with a vitamin D deficiency because of uncertainty about the cutoff for deficiency and variability of available testing assays, which can lead to overdiagnosis or underdiagnosis. A rare but potential harm of treatment with vitamin D is toxicity characterized by marked hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypercalciuria; however, the 25(OH)D level associated with toxicity (typically > 150 ng/mL) is well above the level considered sufficient, and in general, treatment with oral vitamin D does not seem to be associated with serious harms.

Importance

Low serum vitamin D levels have been associated with adverse clinical outcomes; identifying and treating deficiency may improve outcomes.

Objective

To review the evidence about screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and trial registries through March 12, 2020; bibliographies from retrieved articles, outside experts, and surveillance of the literature through November 30, 2020.

Study Selection

Fair- or good-quality, English-language randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of screening with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) compared with no screening, or treatment with vitamin D (with or without calcium) compared with placebo or no treatment conducted in nonpregnant adults; nonrandomized controlled intervention studies for harms only. Treatment was limited to studies enrolling or analyzing participants with low serum vitamin D levels.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers assessed titles/abstracts and full-text articles, extracted data, and assessed study quality; when at least 3 similar studies were available, meta-analyses were conducted.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Mortality, incident fractures, falls, diabetes, cardiovascular events, cancer, depression, physical functioning, and infection.

Results

Forty-six studies (N = 16 205) (77 publications) were included. No studies directly evaluated the health benefits or harms of screening. Among community-dwelling populations, treatment was not significantly associated with mortality (pooled absolute risk difference [ARD], 0.3% [95% CI, -0.6% to 1.1%]; 8 RCTs, n = 2006), any fractures (pooled ARD, -0.3% [95% CI, -2.1% to 1.6%]; 6 RCTs, n = 2186), incidence of diabetes (pooled ARD, 0.1% [95% CI, -1.3% to 1.6%]; 5 RCTs, n = 3356), incidence of cardiovascular disease (2 RCTs; hazard ratio, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.74 to 1.35] and 1.09 [95% CI, 0.68 to 1.76]), incidence of cancer (2 RCTs; hazard ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.68 to 1.39] and 1.01 [95% CI, 0.65 to 1.58], or depression (3 RCTs, various measures reported). The pooled ARD for incidence of participants with 1 or more falls was -4.3% (95% CI, -11.6% to 2.9%; 6 RCTs). The evidence was mixed for the effect of treatment on physical functioning (2 RCTs) and limited for the effect on infection (1 RCT). The incidence of adverse events and kidney stones was similar between treatment and control groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

No studies evaluated the direct benefits or harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency. Among asymptomatic, community-dwelling populations with low vitamin D levels, the evidence suggests that treatment with vitamin D has no effect on mortality or the incidence of fractures, falls, depression, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, or adverse events. The evidence is inconclusive about the effect of treatment on physical functioning and infection.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111fyovA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D screening considerations in generally healthy adults — The panel noted that low vitamin D status has been linked to a number of important health problems and agreed that adverse effects may manifest only after a long latency period, with early detection plausibly improving long-term outcomes; they emphasized that the condition has a latent (preclinical) phase and that persons with positive screening results would be managed differently from those with negative results. They agreed that vitamin D supplementation is widely available, inexpensive, and highly effective at raising 25(OH)D levels, and that high- or moderate-certainty evidence supports acceptable screening test accuracy, although there is still considerable variability of 25(OH)D assays. The systematic review did not identify any studies showing that 25(OH)D testing is harmful, and the panel did not identify harms related to screening other than financial costs; additional considerations included that effective management improves patient-important outcomes when implemented in the latent phase and that any screening strategy should be cost-effective, acceptable to stakeholders, and feasible to implement. This section addresses whether to screen with a 25(OH)D test in generally healthy populations and does not specifically address how those with documented low levels of 25(OH)D should be evaluated or treated.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency: a systematic review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^113BvQRy]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with adverse health outcomes.

Purpose

To systematically review benefits and harms of vitamin D screening in asymptomatic adults.

Data Sources

Ovid MEDLINE (through the third week of August 2014), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

Study Selection

Randomized trials of screening for and treatment of vitamin D deficiency and case-control studies nested within the Women's Health Initiative.

Data Extraction

One investigator abstracted data, a second reviewed data for accuracy, and 2 investigators independently assessed study quality using predefined criteria.

Data Synthesis

No study examined the effects of vitamin D screening versus no screening on clinical outcomes. Vitamin D treatment was associated with decreased mortality versus placebo or no treatment (11 studies; risk ratio [RR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.70 to 0.99]), although benefits were no longer seen after trials of institutionalized persons were excluded (8 studies; RR, 0.93 [CI, 0.73 to 1.18]). Vitamin D treatment was associated with possible decreased risk for having at least 1 fall (5 studies; RR, 0.84 [CI, 0.69 to 1.02]) and falls per person (5 studies; incidence rate ratio, 0.66 [CI, 0.50 to 0.88]) but not fractures (5 studies; RR, 0.98 [CI, 0.82 to 1.16]). Vitamin D treatment was not associated with a statistically significant increased risk for serious adverse events (RR, 1.17 [CI, 0.74 to 1.84]).

Limitation

Variability across studies in 25-hydroxyvitamin D assays and baseline levels, treatment doses, use of calcium, and duration of follow-up.

Conclusion

Treatment of vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic persons might reduce mortality risk in institutionalized elderly persons and risk for falls but not fractures.

### Screening and treatment of vitamin D deficiency on hospital admission: is there a benefit for medical inpatients? [^113C5hj8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Whether screening and treatment of vitamin D deficiency improves clinical outcomes in medical inpatients remains unclear. We performed a systematic search and summarized the evidence from observational and randomized, controlled studies (RCTs) on the influence of vitamin D deficiency and its treatment on patient outcomes.

Methods

The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched in January 2015 using the terms "vitamin D deficiency", "vitamin D", "mortality", "inpatient", "length of stay", "hospitalization", "accidental falls", "quality of life", "activities of daily living", and "intensive care units".

Results

Of 239 potential studies, 29 observational studies and 5 RCTs were included. Observational studies revealed an association between vitamin D deficiency and adverse patient outcomes, such as mortality, higher incidence and severity of infections, and increased duration of hospital stay, in the inpatient and geriatric patient population. The RCT data, however, are inconclusive regarding beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation for reduction of mortality and length of hospital stay, as well as fall prevention.

Conclusions

Despite evidence of associations in observational studies, high-quality evidence from interventional trials on the benefits of vitamin D supplementation in inpatients is currently lacking. On the basis of the available evidence, general vitamin D screening and supplementation for the medical inpatient population in an acute care setting cannot be recommended.

### IOM committee members respond to endocrine society vitamin D guideline [^113736uM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

In early 2011, a committee convened by the Institute of Medicine issued a report on the Dietary Reference Intakes for calcium and vitamin D. The Endocrine Society Task Force in July 2011 published a guideline for the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency. Although these reports are intended for different purposes, the disagreements concerning the nature of the available data and the resulting conclusions have caused confusion for clinicians, researchers, and the public. In this commentary, members of the Institute of Medicine committee respond to aspects of The Endocrine Society guideline that are not well supported and in need of reconsideration. These concerns focus on target serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, the definition of vitamin D deficiency, and the question of who constitutes a population at risk vs. the general population.

Assessment of Vitamin D Status

To date, total serum 25(OH)D, the sum of 25(OH)D 3 and 25(OH)D 2, is the accepted biomarker of vitamin D status (Fig. 2). Observational studies have indicated the beneficial effects of an optimal vitamin D status on various outcomes not directly associated with the classical target tissues for the hormone — the so-called pleiotropic effects. Based on these studies, mostly using traditional radioimmunoassay measurements, vitamin D guidelines issued by major organizations worldwide recommend optimal 25(OH)D levels to be in the range of 50 to 75 nmol/L (20–30 ng/mL). However, optimal levels are still debated for several reasons. Lack of assay standardization contributes to the problem, and initiatives should be implemented to overcome it. In this perspective, the Endocrine Society (ES) has asked a task force to review its 2011 guidelines.

Figure 2.
Overview of vitamin D metabolism. The figure shows metabolism of vitamin D in physiologic and deficient status, with specific reference to conditions in which vitamin D should be evaluated.

Differences in the suggested optimal serum 25(OH)D levels depend on several factors. It is essential to clarify what is meant by optimal 25(OH)D level, that is, for whom and for what, as it is essential to consider patients' clinical profiles and the outcomes of interest. Many studies have been performed with a focus on osteoporosis and bone metabolism. Recently, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessed potential pleiotropic effects of 25(OH)D, in general, with negative results. Another pivotal factor in deciding optimal 25(OH)D levels is the perspective used. For example, although the outcomes used to derive desirable 25(OH)D levels were similar for the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the 2011 ES guidelines, most studies included conclusions that differed. For example, in the case of osteomalacia, although the same study was used, conclusions differed. This is because the ES selected a cutoff above which no individual had osteomalacia (clinical perspective), whereas IOM chose a cutoff where 97.5% of the cohort did not have osteomalacia (public health perspective). Finally, when discussing vitamin D status assessment, it is also important to differentiate between screening, that is, a public health approach undertaken in the general populations, and testing, that is, targeted testing of high-risk individuals in the clinical setting.

Advocacy for routine screening is contingent upon demonstrating that screenings can effectively identify individuals with low 25(OH)D who might not be detected through traditional risk factor assessments and that vitamin D supplementation after identifying a low 25(OH)D level leads to improvements in clinical outcomes; moreover, screening generally healthy adults would involve testing large numbers of people with important health system implications.

### Vitamin D deficiency in patients with liver cirrhosis [^111tPxE5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline (ESCPG) recommend screening for vitamin D deficiency (cutoff < 20 ng/mL) in individuals at high risk for deficiency, including those with hepatic failure, and recommends vitamin D supplementation in cases of deficiency. They also suggest that vitamin D requirements may be greater for sick patients than for healthy individuals and that serum vitamin D levels above 30 ng/mL may have additional benefits in reducing the risk for various disease conditions. They recommend that all adults who are vitamin D deficient to be treated with 50000 IU of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 once a week for 8 weeks or its equivalent of 6000 IU of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 daily to achieve a serum level of 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL, followed by maintenance therapy of 1500–2000 IU/day. Furthermore, they have set minimal daily dietary recommendations of vitamin D intake for patients at high risk for vitamin D deficiency, depending on their age group. The extent of the recommended screening indications is limited to hepatic failure and does not cover the full spectrum of liver diseases.

International liver study associations (both EASL and AASLD) recommend fat-soluble vitamin substitution for the management of all patients with cholestatic liver diseases. These recommendations focus mostly on the prevention of osteoporosis. More specifically, they propose clinical assessment of the risk of osteoporosis for all cholestatic patients and emphasize the importance of both identifying reversible risk factors and applying appropriate lifestyle changes. It is highlighted that the risk of osteoporosis is increased in decompensated disease and in high degree of cholestasis and it is suggested at least annual screening intervals following diagnosis. Finally, it is recommended that calcium and vitamin D supplementation should be considered in all cholestatic disease patients.

### An update on the screening, diagnosis, management, and treatment of vitamin D deficiency in individuals with cystic fibrosis: evidence-based recommendations from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation [^114qJU66]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to develop evidence-based clinical care guidelines for the screening, diagnosis, management, and treatment of vitamin D deficiency in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF).

Participants

The guidelines committee was comprised of physicians, registered dietitians, a pharmacist, a nurse, a parent of an individual with CF, and a health scientist, all with experience in CF.

Process

Committee members developed questions specific to vitamin D health in individuals with CF. Systematic reviews were completed for each question. The committee reviewed and graded the available evidence and developed evidence-based recommendations and consensus recommendations when insufficient evidence was available. Each consensus recommendation was voted upon by an anonymous process.

Conclusions

Vitamin D deficiency is common in CF. Given the limited evidence specific to CF, the committee provided consensus recommendations for most of the recommendations. The committee recommends yearly screening for vitamin D status, preferably at the end of winter, using the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D measurement, with a minimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration of 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/liter) considered vitamin D sufficient in individuals with CF. Recommendations for age-specific vitamin D intake for all individuals with CF, form of vitamin D, and a stepwise approach to increase vitamin D intake when optimal vitamin D status is not achieved are delineated.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 495: vitamin D: screening and supplementation during pregnancy [^114u8Lh2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

During pregnancy, severe maternal vitamin D deficiency has been associated with biochemical evidence of disordered skeletal homeostasis, congenital rickets, and fractures in the newborn. At this time, there is insufficient evidence to support a recommendation for screening all pregnant women for vitamin D deficiency. For pregnant women thought to be at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency, maternal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels can be considered and should be interpreted in the context of the individual clinical circumstance. When vitamin D deficiency is identified during pregnancy, most experts agree that 1,000–2,000 international units per day of vitamin D is safe. Higher dose regimens used for treatment of vitamin D deficiency have not been studied during pregnancy. Recommendations concerning routine vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy beyond that contained in a prenatal vitamin should await the completion of ongoing randomized clinical trials.

Populations at risk of vitamin D deficiency according to a clinical approach

Screening and testing vitamin D status — conclusions

Screening the general population for vitamin D deficiency is very expensive and does not result in practical clinical benefits. 25(OH)D measurements have primarily been indicated in patients with musculoskeletal disorders, but the increased awareness of potential pleiotropic effects has widened the interest in screening, although without any definitive evidence.

The most important risk factors in the general population, as identified by recent studies, include low ambient UV radiation, low vitamin D intake, and gene polymorphisms. Their inclusion as primary risk factors in risk stratification approaches to assess vitamin D status will help effectively target 25(OH)D assessment in those most in need and at risk. Finally, further studies — including those with health economic measures — are warranted to best identify all the situations in which the assessment of vitamin D status is actually needed — or not.

Methods: Assays, Thresholds, and Standardization

Accuracy and precision of vitamin D measurements are crucial to properly use the values obtained in biological fluids. The laboratory methods should be detailed in clinical trials, scientific papers, and even in the reports released to physicians and patients. The measurements could be obtained by either antibody-based methods (chemiluminescent or immunoenzymatic) or by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS or LC-MS/MS), with the latter giving more consistent and accurate results; regardless, the reference material should also be indicated in the report. The laboratory should define the reference values considering the method used for analyzing the molecule(s). The unit of measure (molar or mass) should be clearly indicated. The mol/L unit should be preferred as the SI standard unit; alternatively, both mol/L and ng/mL should be reported. Moreover, the critical difference (or least significance change), or reference change values, that is, the value (percentage) testifying to a real modification of the molecule(s) concentration between 2 consecutive measurements, assayed with the same method, in the same patient, and, on the contrary, that the modification is not only dependent from analytical and biological variability (natural oscillation of values in individuals), should be known and properly considered.

Theoretically, obtaining a 25(OH)D level within an optimal window for the general population will necessarily result in overscreening and overtreatment of healthy individuals. While general screening for 25(OH)D deficiency/insufficiency is not recommended, measurements could be performed in patients with several risk factors for severe deficiency or who are being evaluated for metabolic bone disease. This recommendation may help to mitigate the dramatic increase in the number of 25(OH)D measurements and the associated economic burden. Supporting this view, initiatives have been undertaken to reduce unnecessary 25(OH)D analyses in Australia. The change in recommended testing criteria halved the number of measurements but paradoxically increased the number of unnecessary tests and decreased tests of patients at high risk of deficiency, with only a small improvement in the detection of deficiency.

Levels of 25(OH)D in the general population vary considerably depending on several factors, including the season, latitude, cultural factors leading to reduced UVB light exposure, skin pigmentation, body mass index (BMI), sex, age, level of physical exercise, and food fortification with vitamin D or use of vitamin D supplements, even among otherwise comparable Western societies; moreover, genetic factors such as gene polymorphisms may have major effects on serum 25(OH)D according to twin studies and mendelian randomization (MR) reports.

In considering when to test for vitamin D deficiency, it is well recognized that serum 25(OH)D levels vary by season. This is not surprising, given that most vitamin D is generated in the skin following UVB exposure with little vitamin D available from the average unfortified diet. Given an observed drop in 25(OH)D levels between seasons, a higher target (∼75 nmol/L) may be required at the end of summer to allow for the anticipated 10 to 25 nmol/L drop during the winter months. For example, in a sunny country, such as Australia, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (< 50 nmol/L) is as high as 36% during winter and as low as 14% in summer. In Lebanon, another sunny country, mean serum 25(OH)D levels were 12 to 15 nmol/L higher in summer to fall compared to winter. In this regard, measurement of serum 25(OH)D levels at the end of winter or in early spring would increase the detection of low 25(OH)D levels in the general population.

Vitamin D deficiency in children — screening advises that pediatricians "should have a low threshold for screening for vitamin D deficiency" in the presence of nonspecific symptoms, in dark-skinned infants at higher latitudes in winter and spring, in children on anticonvulsants or chronic glucocorticoids, and in those with malabsorption-related diseases; "Another possible group to consider screening" is children with frequent fractures and low bone mineral density. A practical tool is "serum ALP, which if elevated for age should be followed with measurements of serum 25(OH)-D, calcium, phosphorus, and PTH", along with "radiologic examination of the distal ends of (1) the radius and ulna (wrist anteroposterior view) or (2) tibia and femur (knee anteroposterior view)"; reference ranges note "ALP levels are usually < 500 IU/L in neonates and < 1000 IU/L in children up to 9 years of age", and "the wrist radiograph may be the most reliable test for detecting subclinical rickets".

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin D requirements, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to consider advising intake of at least 600 and 800 IU/day of vitamin D in adults aged 50–70 and > 70 years, respectively. Insufficient evidence whether 600 and 800 IU/day of vitamin D are enough to provide all of the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D. Recognize that at least 1,500–2,000 IU/day of supplemental vitamin D may be required to raise the blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D > 30 ng/mL.

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — healthy adults screening with a 25(OH)D test: In healthy adults, we suggest against routine screening for 25(OH)D levels (2 |⊕⊕○○). This applies to adults who do not otherwise have established indications for testing with 25(OH)D levels (e.g., hypocalcemia), and reflects that in healthy adults, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials. The panel noted that variable access to 25(OH)D testing could be an important barrier for some, that screening entire adult populations would involve substantial costs and effort, thus feasibility from a societal perspective is unclear, that the panel did not identify studies that adequately addressed the cost-effectiveness of 25(OH)D screening in all adults, and that the effect of screening on health equity is unclear; it also recognized that it is possible that there is no single threshold 25(OH)D level appropriate for the entire general population.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^117TXj6D]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in children — summary and guidelines identify higher-risk groups and thresholds. The risk of vitamin D deficiency is higher in dark-skinned populations, children who live at higher latitudes, exclusively breastfed infants and children, infants born to vitamin D–deficient mothers, and premature infants and may also be affected by cultural practices. 25(OH)-D levels should be maintained at least above 50 nmol/L (20 ng/dL) in infants and children, and studies are necessary to determine if a level of 80 nmol/L (32 ng/ mL) should be considered the cutoff for vitamin D sufficiency in a pediatric population. Risks associated with exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) need to be balanced against risks of deficient cutaneous vitamin D synthesis, and currently recommended sun exposure for infants is insufficient to maintain vitamin D levels in the recommended range for dark-skinned infants and children, particularly at higher latitudes and during the winter months.

### A systematic review supporting the endocrine society clinical practice guidelines on vitamin D [^117Va2Uq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Context

Low vitamin D status is common and is associated with various common medical conditions.

Objective

To support the development of the Endocrine Society's Clinical Practice Guideline on Vitamin D for the Prevention of Disease.

Methods

We searched multiple databases for studies that addressed 14 clinical questions prioritized by the guideline panel. Of the 14 questions, 10 clinical questions assessed the effect of vitamin D vs no vitamin D in the general population throughout the lifespan, during pregnancy, and in adults with prediabetes; 1 question assessed dosing; and 3 questions addressed screening with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to assess certainty of evidence.

Results

Electronic searches yielded 37 007 citations, from which we included 151 studies. In children and adolescents, low-certainty evidence suggested reduction in respiratory tract infections with empiric vitamin D. There was no significant effect on select outcomes in healthy adults aged 19 to 74 years with variable certainty of evidence. There was a very small reduction in mortality among adults older than 75 years with high certainty of evidence. In pregnant women, low-certainty evidence suggested possible benefit on various maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. In adults with prediabetes, moderate certainty of evidence suggested reduction in the rate of progression to diabetes. Administration of high-dose intermittent vitamin D may increase falls, compared to lower-dose daily dosing. We did not identify trials on the benefits and harms of screening with serum 25(OH)D.

Conclusion

The evidence summarized in this systematic review addresses the benefits and harms of vitamin D for the prevention of disease. The guideline panel considered additional information about individuals' and providers' values and preferences and other important decisional and contextual factors to develop clinical recommendations.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1114js6Q]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — empiric vitamin D use and 25(OH)D testing: The panel suggests empiric vitamin D supplementation for children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years, for adults aged 75 years and older, for those who are pregnant, and for those with high‑risk prediabetes because of its potential to lower disease risks noted on the page. For nonpregnant people older than 50 years for whom vitamin D is indicated, the panel suggests daily administration rather than intermittent use of high doses. The panel suggests against empiric vitamin D supplementation above the current DRI to lower disease risk in healthy adults younger than 75 years, and suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in all populations considered because routine screening lacks supporting clinical trial evidence (including in those with obesity or dark complexion) and no clear preventive target level was identified. These recommendations are not meant to replace the current DRIs and do not apply to those with established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing.

Benefits of early detection and treatment — The USPSTF found no studies that directly evaluated the benefits of screening for vitamin D deficiency, but 26 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and 1 nested case-control study assessed treatment with deficiency variably defined as < 20 ng/mL to ≤ 31.2 ng/mL across outcomes. For all-cause mortality, trials ranged from 16 weeks to 7 years and a pooled analysis of 8 trials (n = 2006) showed no difference with vitamin D treatment vs controls (relative risk [RR], 1.13 [95% CI, 0.93–1.28]). For incident diabetes, 5 RCTs with 1 to 7 years of follow-up (n = 3356) found no difference (RR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.80–1.15]). For cardiovascular events, VITAL (n = 2001) and ViDA (n = 1270) reported no statistically significant differences among subgroups with serum vitamin D levels less than 20 ng/mL at baseline; VITAL had 5.3 years of follow-up and ViDA had 3.3 years of follow-up. For cancer incidence, VITAL and a post hoc ViDA analysis reported no difference among participants with serum 25(OH)D levels less than 20 ng/mL at baseline; ViDA had only 3 years of follow-up, and in the WHI Calcium–Vitamin D nested case-control, there was no significant difference at less than 12 ng/mL (adjusted OR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.59–1.79]) or between 12 and 20 ng/mL (adjusted OR, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.87–1.48]). For falls, pooled data found no association with number of falls (RR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.75–1.08]). In VITAL–DEP, among those with baseline less than 20 ng/mL (n = 1328), there was no difference in change in depression scores over a median 5.3 years. An unplanned subgroup analysis found no difference in incidence of a first urinary tract infection among participants with vitamin D deficiency treated with vitamin D compared with placebo. For outcomes with sufficient data (mortality, fractures, and falls), findings were similar between studies using a lower threshold and studies using a higher threshold.

How much vitamin D should people get?

A very important first step would be to ensure that all people get at least as much vitamin D with a dietary supplement as recommended for the various countries. The recommended daily amount is 400 IU in the UK. US recommendations are 600 IU for adults up to 70 years of age, and 800 IU for people over the age of 70. Individuals with known risk factors need more, but current recommendations are silent on their specific needs. Higher intakes are likely safe as long as the amounts are well under 4000 IU per day.

Summary of Vitamin D Deficiency-associated Clinical Outcomes

The long-known skeletal benefits of vitamin D and calcium related to rickets or osteoporosis remain valid. Most reported extraskeletal benefits of vitamin D were not confirmed by recent, large RCTs (see Table 3). The gradual increase in vitamin D levels in Western populations may explain these null findings, and older trials and meta-analyses may be more likely to show benefits because individuals were more likely to be vitamin D deficient than they are nowadays. RCTs and metanalyses published to date do not have adequate power to evaluate important subgroups, such as individuals with low 25(OH)D levels, men, the very old, ethnic groups other than White individuals, and those from low-income countries. Moreover, most of the studies use adverse events data to identify fractures and were performed in adults who were vitamin D replete at baseline in whom benefit would be unlikely and toxicity possible. Such studies confound the identification of possible beneficial effects in vitamin D–deficient individuals who might benefit from supplementation. Thus, when it comes to vitamin D, it is advisable to "giveth to those who needeth". In fact, the benefit-to-risk ratio for vitamin D depends on the target population and medical condition. It would be incorrect to extrapolate vitamin D guidelines that apply to the general population (such as those from the US National Academic of Medicine) to avoid vitamin D deficiency (ie, rickets, osteomalacia) and promote bone health to special populations for whom the benefit-to-risk ratio of vitamin D would be different.

Nonetheless, RCTs, MR studies, and metanalyses suggest a link between vitamin D status with the immune system and diabetes, as well as fleeting effects on some CV events and some benefits on mortality risk when vitamin D 3 is used.

### Effects of vitamin D supplementation on bone density in healthy children: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111SUYJi]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

In light of these data, the approach to addressing vitamin D deficiency in children and adolescents warrants further consideration. Possible choices include fortification of food or direct supplementation at either population or individual level. In trials of increasing vitamin D intake in children, whether through fortification of food or supplements, it is possible to achieve increases in serum vitamin D levels, but the doses of cholecalciferol required to correct deficiency and reach post-intervention vitamin D concentrations above 50 nmol/L are in excess of 400 IU/day. Thus, while food fortification may offer some protection against vitamin D deficiency in children, it is unlikely a sufficient dose could be delivered to achieve adequate serum levels in children with deficiency. Unfortunately, the alternative of screening for vitamin D deficiency and then correcting it is more costly and relatively invasive. The cost effectiveness and acceptability of screening remains to be established, including carrying out further randomised controlled trials to assess the benefits of doing so for bone health.

Serum 25OHD Levels and Screening

Guidelines regarding the use of serum markers of vitamin D status for medical management of individual patients and for screening were beyond the scope of the Committee's charge, and evidence-based consensus guidelines are not available. However, these issues should be addressed by appropriate federal agencies and professional organizations in light of the findings in this report. As noted above, the Committee recognized that serum 25OHD is a useful integrated marker of vitamin D exposure, incorporating endogenous synthesis from solar exposure, dietary intake from foods, fortified products, and/or supplements, and other factors. However, the Committee also recognized that observational studies of correlations between 25OHD and clinical outcomes are subject to confounding and do not prove causation. Concerns about inaccurate or imprecise serum 25OHD measurements are being overcome by methodological advances, frequent quality assessments, and accurate calibration tools. In contrast, serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D represents a more complex endocrine parameter, regulated by calcium and PTH status and affected by kidney function. After a careful review of available literature, the Committee concluded that serum 25OHD levels of 16 ng/ml (40 nmol/liter) cover the requirements of approximately half the population, and levels of 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) cover the requirements of at least 97.5% of the population. These levels will be useful to clinicians as they consider management of patients under their care. For upper levels of serum 25OHD, sparse data are available, particularly regarding long-term effects of chronically high concentrations, and a margin of safety for public health recommendations is prudent. Thus, serum 25OHD levels above 50 ng/ml (125 nmol/liter) should raise concerns among clinicians about potential adverse effects.

Key Points

Question

Is vitamin D status, reflecting vitamin D levels and treatment, associated with test results for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?

Findings

In this cohort study of 489 patients who had a vitamin D level measured in the year before COVID-19 testing, the relative risk of testing positive for COVID-19 was 1.77 times greater for patients with likely deficient vitamin D status compared with patients with likely sufficient vitamin D status, a difference that was statistically significant.

Meaning

These findings appear to support a role of vitamin D status in COVID-19 risk; randomized clinical trials are needed to determine whether broad population interventions and interventions among groups at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 could reduce COVID-19 incidence.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^115qyHxu]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Severe vitamin D deficiency — Currently, severe deficiency is somewhat arbitrarily defined as a 25(OH)-D level of ≤ 12.5 nmol/L (5 ng/mL). In one study, 86% of the children studied who had 25(OH)-D levels of < 20 nmol/L (8 ng/mL) had rickets, and 94% of the hypocalcemic children with vitamin D deficiency had levels of < 20 nmol/L (8 ng/mL).

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111FnWfU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D — generally healthy adults aged 50 to 74 years: Subgroup analyses did not provide evidence for benefit with vitamin D in subgroups with 25(OH)D below 20 to 24 ng/mL (50–60 nmol/L), and based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D, in addition to the anticipated undesirable effects, are likely to be trivial. The panel judged that vitamin D supplementation appears to have little or no beneficial impact on the outcomes analyzed in healthy populations aged 50 to 74 years, and concluded there was therefore no compelling rationale to recommend empiric vitamin D in this age group. Noting monetary costs and that a recommendation for 25(OH)D testing could decrease feasibility and health equity, the panel suggested against routine 25(OH)D testing (eg, screening) in generally healthy adults aged 50 to 74 years.

### ESPEN guideline on clinical nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease [^1157dBB6]. Clinical Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ulcerative colitis, more specifically with respect to screening for osteoporosis, ESPEN 2023 guidelines recommend to monitor serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D status in adult and pediatric patients with active IBD on corticosteroid treatment or suspected vitamin D deficiency. Initiate calcium/vitamin D supplementation, if required, to prevent low bone mineral density. Manage osteopenia and osteoporosis according to current osteoporosis guidelines.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^116dk6uZ]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Growing preclinical and clinical observations associating vitamin D with many health clinical conditions have been progressively reported in recent years. However, the lack of rigorous methodologies on patient enrollment, vitamin D supplements, and standardized laboratory assays have limited the ability to draw definitive conclusions about these data that still need to be more clearly understood.

Thus, a "whys, whens, and hows" of vitamin D assessment and supplementation derived from an international expert panel discussion about controversial topics regarding vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation is needed to help the scientific community in evaluating and conducting future further studies with more rigorous methodologies, to better explore any clinical setting potentially influenced by vitamin D, and to provide reliable data required to update our international recommendations.

### USPSTF recommendation: screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults… [^1149Fjct]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Total 25D levels are currently considered the best marker of vitamin D status; however, levels are difficult to measure accurately. Evidence suggests that results vary by testing method and between laboratories using the same testing methods. No direct evidence on the benefits of screening for vitamin D deficiency. Adequate evidence that treatment of asymptomatic vitamin D deficiency has no benefit on mortality, risk for fractures in persons selected solely on the basis of low vitamin D levels, or incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Objective To update its 2014 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force commissioned a systematic review on screening for vitamin D deficiency, including the benefits and harms of screening and early treatment. Population Community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults who have no signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended.

Quiz Ref IDThis recommendation applies to community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults who have no signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency, such as bone pain or muscle weakness, or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended. This recommendation focuses on screening, which differs from USPSTF recommendation statements on supplementation. The goal of screening for vitamin D deficiency would be to identify and treat it before associated adverse clinical outcomes occur. Total 25D level is currently considered the best marker of vitamin D status. 4, 19 A variety of assays can be used to measure 25D levels; however, levels can be difficult to measure accurately, and assays may underestimate or overestimate 25D levels.

Additionally, the current evidence is inadequate to determine whether screening for and treatment of asymptomatic low 25D levels improve clinical outcomes in community-dwelling adults. To update its 2014 recommendation statement, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review26, 27 of the evidence on screening for vitamin D deficiency, including the benefits and harms of screening and early treatment. The review focused on asymptomatic, community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults 18 years or older who do not have clinical signs of vitamin D deficiency or conditions that could cause vitamin D deficiency, or for which vitamin D treatment is recommended, and who were seen in primary care settings.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: recommendation… [^114PB7EQ]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefit of treatment of asymptomatic vitamin D deficiency on other outcomes, including psychosocial and physical functioning. Although the evidence is adequate for a few limited outcomes, the overall evidence on the early treatment of asymptomatic, screen-detected vitamin D deficiency in adults to improve overall health outcomes is inadequate. USPSTF ASSESSMENT The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults to improve health outcomes is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening and early intervention cannot be determined. Clinical Considerations PATIENT POPULATION UNDER CONSIDERATION This recommendation applies to community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults aged 18 years or older who are seen in primary care settings and are not known to have signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended.

This recommendation focuses on screening, which is different from other USPSTF recommendation statements on supplementation. If a threshold total serum 25-D level could be established to define vitamin D deficiency and if testing assays could be standardized, the goal of screening for vitamin D deficiency would be to identify and treat it before associated adverse clinical outcomes occur. However, current evidence is inadequate to determine whether screening for and treatment of asymptomatic low 25-D levels improve clinical outcomes in community-dwelling adults. Potential Harms.

Screening may misclassify persons with a vitamin D deficiency because of the uncertainty about the cut point for defining deficiency and the variability of available testing assays. Misclassification may result in overdiagnosis or underdiagnosis. SCREENING TESTS Current vitamin D assays measure total serum 25-D levels to determine vitamin D status. Many testing methods are available, including competitive protein binding, immunoassay, high-performance liquid chromatography, and combined high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.

### USPSTF review: screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults… [^114UkbSb]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Incidence of ≥ 2 falls: adjusted OR, 1. 03 for participants with vitamin D level < 12 ng/mL; adjusted OR,
1. 13 for participants with vitamin D level between > 12 ng/mL and ≤ 20 ng/mL. The rationale for screening for vitamin D deficiency among asymptomatic adults is to identify low serum vitamin D levels that place persons at risk for deficiency and offer treatment before potential adverse clinical outcomes occur. In 2014, the US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that the evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults. This review was conducted for the USPSTF to inform an update of its 2014 recommendation. 7–9. For KQ1 and KQ2, studies that were conducted among participants not known to have vitamin D deficiency were eligible for selection.

For KQ3 and KQ4, studies that either enrolled participants with known deficiency or reported findings for a subgroup of participants with known deficiency were eligible, as were nested case-control studies within RCTs. For KQ1 and KQ3, studies reporting health outcomes, such as mortality, falls, fractures, incident disease, and validated quality of life, and self-reported physical functioning measures were eligible; studies reporting only changes in serum vitamin D levels, intermediate physiologic outcomes, or physical fitness/muscle strength measures were not eligible. Key Question 1a. Does screening for vitamin D deficiency improve health outcomes. Key Question 1b.

Does screening efficacy vary among patient subpopulations at higher risk for vitamin D deficiency or vary by race/ethnicity. All studies used vitamin D3 as part of the active treatment intervention. Most studies used daily doses, which varied from as low as 400 IU to as high as 4000 IU.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults… [^1129Keqr]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Case Study A 49-year-old Black man with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and class I obesity presents for a wellness examination. The patient's hypertension and diabetes are well controlled with lisinopril and metformin; they do not take any other medications. The patient feels well today, with no health complaints and a negative review of systems. The patient tells you that they recently read an online article about vitamin D and is concerned they might have a low vitamin D level. B. The patient should be screened for vitamin D deficiency because screening is indicated in male patients. C. The patient should not be screened for vitamin D deficiency because their age stratifies them in the low-risk category for vitamin D deficiency. D. The patient should be screened for vitamin D deficiency because screening is recommended due to the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the United States. B.

Serum 25D is currently considered the best marker of vitamin D status. C. Laboratories are reliably well standardized in their testing methods. D. Vitamin D requirements may vary by individual.
3. According to the USPSTF, which one of the following statements about risk factors for a low vitamin D level is correct. A. People who have a body mass index of less than 25 kg per m 2are at higher risk for low vitamin D levels than people who are obese. B. Frequent sun exposure is paradoxically associated with a higher risk of low vitamin D levels. C. Younger people have a higher risk of low vitamin D levels than older people. D. Black people have a higher prevalence of low vitamin D levels than White people. E. Known risk factors account for almost all of the variability in 25D levels among individuals. Additionally, evidence suggests that results vary by testing method and between laboratories using the same testing methods.

Despite these variations, total serum 25D is considered the best marker of vitamin D status. 1, 2 The correct answer is D. Black people have a higher prevalence of low vitamin D levels than White people, although the clinical significance of this risk is uncertain.
