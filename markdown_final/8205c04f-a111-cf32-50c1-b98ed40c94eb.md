## Question

What are tonsil stones?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what tonsil stones are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining tonsil stones and their core characteristics. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology, including biofilm biology and calcification. Next, I will review epidemiology and clinical manifestations. After that, I need to check diagnostic approaches, including when imaging is warranted. Finally, I will consider management strategies, including when surgery is indicated, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these elements together with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and basic features. Tonsil stones, or tonsilloliths, are calcified concretions that develop within the crypts of the palatine tonsils; they are typically small and asymptomatic but can enlarge and cause symptoms such as halitosis, dysphagia, globus sensation, and referred otalgia, and they are often discovered incidentally on imaging obtained for other reasons [^115Z6mAJ] [^116bxofU].

> Wait, let me verify the composition and morphology. Tonsilloliths are composed of calcium salts including hydroxyapatite or calcium carbonate apatite, oxalates, magnesium salts, and ammonium radicals; histologically they resemble dental biofilms with corncob structures, filaments, and cocci, and they can be single or multiple and unilateral or bilateral depending on crypt involvement [^115Z6mAJ] [^115Zd934].

> I need to check the pathophysiology next. The prevailing model is that chronic tonsillar inflammation leads to crypt enlargement and trapping of bacteria, cellular debris, and food particles; these materials organize into a biofilm with oxygen gradients, and over time dystrophic calcification occurs, producing a stone; importantly, tonsilloliths are living biofilms with active bacterial metabolism, including oxygen respiration, denitrification, and acid production, which helps explain halitosis and persistent irritation [^115Z6mAJ] [^115Zd934].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about prevalence without anchoring to clinical context. Small tonsilloliths are common incidental findings, whereas larger, symptomatic stones are less frequent; tonsillectomy series show that tonsillar stones account for a minority of indications, around 6.8% in one adult cohort, and there is a perceived increase in presentations possibly related to social media awareness, though causality is uncertain [^113ywYNu] [^1129VcD4].

> Let me consider the clinical manifestations carefully. Most small stones are asymptomatic, but larger stones can cause halitosis from anaerobic metabolism, foreign-body sensation or globus, dysphagia, and referred otalgia; rarely, very large stones can mimic abscess or neoplasia and cause significant airway or swallowing symptoms, prompting imaging and surgical consideration [^115Z6mAJ] [^114FS5K8].

> I should double-check the diagnostic approach. Diagnosis is primarily clinical via inspection and palpation of the tonsillar crypts; when stones are obscured or the diagnosis is uncertain, panoramic radiography, CT, or MRI can confirm calcified concretions and distinguish them from other calcifications or foreign bodies; transoral sonography has been reported as a comfortable office-based adjunct in select cases, though evidence is limited [^116bxofU] [^115Z6mAJ].

> Next, I should review management and make sure I align with evidence strength. For asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic stones, expectant management with saltwater gargles, oral hygiene, and manual expression is reasonable; for persistent halitosis or recurrent symptoms attributable to cryptic disease, office-based cryptolysis techniques such as laser or coblation can reduce crypt burden and symptoms with favorable safety profiles; tonsillectomy is reserved for refractory cases or when stones are too large to pass spontaneously, recognizing that tonsillectomy carries morbidity and that the indication for stones alone is relatively uncommon [^112BrrDu] [^114FS5K8] [^112sdQe5] [^113ywYNu].

> But wait, what if the stone is actually something else? I need to ensure we keep mimics in mind. Large or atypically located calcifications may be confused with neoplasm, foreign body, or other calcified lesions; in such cases, imaging and, when indicated, tissue diagnosis help avoid misclassification and guide appropriate therapy [^115Z6mAJ].

> Let me synthesize succinctly. Tonsil stones are calcified biofilm concretions arising in chronically inflamed tonsillar crypts; they are common as small, silent findings but can enlarge to cause halitosis, dysphagia, globus, and referred otalgia; diagnosis is clinical with imaging reserved for uncertainty or large lesions; management is typically conservative, with office cryptolysis for bothersome cryptic disease and tonsillectomy for refractory or very large stones, balancing modest benefits against surgical risks and patient preferences [^115Z6mAJ] [^112BrrDu] [^114FS5K8] [^112sdQe5].

---

Tonsil stones (tonsilloliths) are **calcified concretions** [^115Z6mAJ] that form in tonsillar crypts from trapped debris, bacteria, and calcium salts; they are usually asymptomatic but can cause halitosis, sore throat, dysphagia, or a foreign-body sensation [^115Z6mAJ]. Diagnosis is **clinical**, with imaging (CT/MRI) reserved for large or atypical cases [^115Z6mAJ]. Management is **conservative** — gargles, manual removal, or cryptolysis [^114FS5K8] — with tonsillectomy for refractory or severe cases [^112BrrDu]. They are common, benign, and not associated with malignancy [^112BrrDu].

---

## Composition and structure

Tonsil stones are **primarily composed of calcium salts** (hydroxyapatite, calcium carbonate apatite, oxalates, magnesium salts, and ammonium radicals) [^115Z6mAJ] and organic material such as bacteria, cellular debris, and food particles [^115Zd934]. Microscopically, they resemble dental biofilms, with corncob structures, filaments, and cocci, and exhibit stratified layers with oxygen respiration at the outer layer, denitrification in the middle, and acidification at the bottom [^115Zd934].

---

## Pathogenesis

Tonsil stones arise from **chronic inflammation** of the tonsils, leading to enlarged crypts that trap debris and bacteria [^115Z6mAJ]. Over time, this material undergoes dystrophic calcification, forming hard concretions [^115Z6mAJ]. Biofilm formation within the stones creates oxygen gradients and supports anaerobic bacterial metabolism, contributing to halitosis and persistent symptoms [^115Zd934].

---

## Clinical presentation

Tonsil stones are often **asymptomatic** and discovered incidentally [^115Z6mAJ]. When symptomatic, common features include:

- **Halitosis**: Foul-smelling breath due to anaerobic bacterial metabolism [^117JXcSk].
- **Sore throat**: Mild discomfort or irritation [^114FS5K8].
- **Dysphagia**: Difficulty swallowing from larger stones [^115Z6mAJ].
- **Foreign-body sensation**: Feeling of something stuck in the throat [^115Z6mAJ].
- **Referred otalgia**: Ear pain from shared neural pathways [^115Z6mAJ].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, based on oral examination revealing white or yellowish, hard concretions within tonsillar crypts [^116bxofU]. Imaging (panoramic radiography, CT, or MRI) may be used for large, atypical, or deeply embedded stones, or to distinguish them from other calcified lesions [^115Z6mAJ].

---

## Management

Management depends on **symptom severity** and patient preference:

- **Conservative management**: Saltwater gargles, manual removal with cotton swabs or irrigation, and improved oral hygiene are first-line for mild cases [^notfound].
- **Cryptolysis**: Laser or coblation cryptolysis reduces crypt depth and recurrence, offering a minimally invasive alternative to tonsillectomy [^114FS5K8] [^112sdQe5].
- **Tonsillectomy**: Reserved for severe, recurrent, or refractory cases with significant morbidity; effective but associated with pain, bleeding, and anesthesia risks [^112BrrDu] [^113ywYNu].

---

## Prevalence and demographics

Tonsil stones are **common**, with prevalence estimates varying widely due to differing diagnostic criteria and populations studied. They occur in both children and adults, with higher incidence in individuals with chronic tonsillitis, cryptic tonsils, or poor oral hygiene [^notfound].

---

## Complications

Complications are **rare** but may include:

- **Chronic halitosis**: Persistent bad breath affecting social interactions [^117JXcSk].
- **Recurrent tonsillitis**: Repeated infections due to chronic inflammation and bacterial colonization [^notfound].
- **Peritonsillar abscess**: Rarely, secondary infection may lead to abscess formation [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **excellent**; tonsil stones are benign and carry no malignant potential. Conservative management is effective for most patients, and surgical options provide durable relief for refractory cases [^112BrrDu].

---

Tonsil stones are **benign calcified concretions** in tonsillar crypts, typically managed conservatively, with cryptolysis or tonsillectomy for persistent symptoms. They are common, non-malignant, and have an excellent prognosis with appropriate care [^115Z6mAJ].

### Tonsillitis and tonsilloliths: diagnosis and management [^112BrrDu]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Tonsillitis, or inflammation of the tonsils, makes up approximately 0.4% of outpatient visits in the United States. Tonsillitis is caused by a viral infection in 70% to 95% of cases. However, bacterial infections caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) account for tonsillitis in 5% to 15% of adults and 15% to 30% of patients five to 15 years of age. It is important to differentiate group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus from other bacterial or viral causes of pharyngitis and tonsillitis because of the risk of progression to more systemic complications such as abscess, acute glomerulonephritis, rheumatic fever, and scarlet fever after infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. A variety of diagnostic tools are available, including symptom-based validated scoring systems (e.g. Centor score), and oropharyngeal and serum laboratory testing. Treatment is focused on supportive care, and if group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus is identified, penicillin should be used as the first-line antibiotic. In cases of recurrent tonsillitis, watchful waiting is strongly recommended if there have been less than seven episodes in the past year, less than five episodes per year for the past two years, or less than three episodes per year for the past three years. Tonsilloliths, or tonsil stones, are managed expectantly, and small tonsilloliths are common clinical findings. Rarely, surgical intervention is required if they become too large to pass on their own.

### Coblation cryptolysis to treat tonsil stones: a retrospective case series [^1111txpG]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2012). Low credibility.

We introduce a novel and potentially effective approach in the treatment of tonsil stones using Coblation technology. A retrospective pilot case series was performed demonstrating the effectiveness of a technique that we call Coblation tonsil cryptolysis. This technique is unique in that it can be performed in adult patients without sedation using only local anesthesia, much like laser tonsil cryptolysis. As with laser cryptolysis, pain is significant for only a few days and most adults can resume normal diet and activity within 1 week. In contrast, tonsillectomy entails significant morbidity for several weeks. However, Coblation avoids the significant disadvantages of laser use, including the potential for airway fire, retinal damage from reflected scatter, dealing with plume from vaporized tissues, oral/facial burns, and the high cost of purchasing and maintaining laser equipment. After a single session of Coblation tonsil cryptolysis, a significant decrease and even elimination of tonsil stones can potentially be achieved.

### Adult tonsillectomy: an evaluation of indications and complications [^113ywYNu]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate current adult tonsillectomy indications along with risk factors associated with postoperative complications.

Methods

In this retrospective chart review, demographic, clinical, and surgical data were collected from 2004 to 2020 of adult patients who underwent tonsillectomy. Indications for surgery were categorized as infectious etiology, biopsy, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and tonsillar stones. Data regarding postoperative hemorrhage, emergency department (ED) visits, and readmissions were collected. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate factors associated with postoperative complications.

Results

574 adults (mean age 32 years, 69.9% F vs. 30.1% M) were included. The most common indication was infections (62.2%), followed by biopsy (26.5%), tonsillar stones (6.8%), and OSA (4.5%). The highest frequency of postoperative bleeds (17.9%) occurred in the tonsillar stones cohort; however, the indication for surgery was not a significant predictor on multivariate analysis. Male sex and younger age were independent predictors of postoperative bleeding, while younger age was a significant predictor of postoperative ED visits. There was a significant linear trend of an increasing proportion of tonsillectomies performed for tonsillar stones compared to other indications for 2011–2019.

Conclusion

Infectious etiology was the most common indication for tonsillectomy. Indication for surgery was not a significant predictor of postoperative bleeding; however, male sex and younger age had higher odds of postoperative bleeding. The proportion of tonsillectomies performed for tonsillar stones was steadily increasing.

### Halitosis and the tonsils: a review of management [^117JXcSk]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Halitosis secondary to pathology of the palatine tonsils is considered airway (type 2) halitosis in the etiologic classification. Reports differ as to the proportion of objective halitosis complaints that have tonsillar etiology, with some giving this figure as 3%. Due to their immunologic role, even healthy tonsils usually possess some subclinical inflammation. The tonsil crypt system is also the most ideal environment for anaerobic bacterial activity in the upper respiratory tract. Tonsillar halitosis is thought to occur mainly because of chronic caseous tonsillitis and tonsillolithiasis (tonsil stones). Tonsillectomy and various cryptolysis techniques are reported to improve halitosis in such cases. In this article, diagnostic methods and evidence for interventions are reviewed.

Data Source

Medline search.

Review Methods

Studies reporting the efficacy of any intervention (medical or surgical) on tonsillar halitosis were included, whether halitosis was the focus or one of several measures.

Conclusions

There are insufficient high-quality studies on this topic. Improved methodology, for example, use of control groups and utilization of more accurate halitosis detection/quantification techniques, are required.

Implications For Practice

Lack of evidence currently prevents firm conclusions, but the following is recommended: (1) Use reliable methods for halitosis diagnosis and confirmation of tonsillar etiology. Initial treatment such as tongue scraping is useful to rule out oral halitosis. (2) Tonsillar procedures are contraindicated in: subjective halitosis, non-tonsillar etiology, or if medical management resolves halitosis. (3) Where indicated and where facilities permit, less invasive techniques such as laser cryptolysis may be preferable to tonsillectomy in adults, potentially avoiding general anesthetic and the higher risk associated with tonsillectomy in this group.

### TikTok tonsils [^1129VcD4]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

There has been a subjective increase in the number of patients presenting for tonsil stones to our pediatric otolaryngology clinic. This may be related to frequent viewing of videos on the social media application, TikTok, pertaining to tonsil stones.

### Cholecystectomy, gallstones, tonsillectomy, and pancreatic cancer risk: a population-based case-control study in Minnesota [^114qPyga]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the US. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has estimated that 138 100 men and 127 900 women died from this malignancy worldwide in 2008. Despite high mortality, pancreatic cancer etiology virtually remains obscure. Although cigarette smoking has been established as a risk factor, it accounts for only about 25–30% of the variation of the disease. It is apparent that more risk factors need to be identified to enable the primary prevention of pancreatic cancer.

Cholecystectomy, gallstones (cholelithiasis), and tonsillectomy are common medical conditions/procedures. To date, at least 13 epidemiologic studies have investigated the associations of cholecystectomy and/or gallstones with pancreatic cancer risk. The results obtained from these studies are overall conflicting. Significantly increased risk associated with cholecystectomy and/or gallstones was observed in one case-control study and four cohort studies. However, null associations were found among four case-control studies and four cohort studies. Cholecystectomy and/or gallstones may occur as a manifestation of subclinical pancreatic cancer. Therefore, one of the potential reasons for these discrepant findings is that many previous studies failed to consider the time interval between diagnosis of medical conditions and of pancreatic cancer.

Tonsils are organs of lymphoid tissue that constitute the first line of defense of the immune system against invading pathogens. Tonsillectomy is usually performed following repeated occurrence of acute tonsillitis and airway obstruction. Data are scarce on whether tonsillectomy has any influence on pancreatic cancer risk. The present study thereby sought to evaluate cholecystectomy, gallstones, and tonsillectomy in relation to the risk of this fatal disease in a population-based case-control study in Minnesota.

### Tonsillolith: not just a stone but a living biofilm [^115Zd934]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the morphology and activity of tonsilloliths, demonstrating oxygen respiration, denitrification, and acidification on exposure to sucrose.

Study Design

Tonsilloliths were extracted in atraumatic conditions during tonsillectomy from 16 adults and sent to two different laboratories for histological, bacteriological, and biofilm studies under sterile conditions.

Setting

Multicenter laboratory study.

Subjects and Methods

Multiple tonsilloliths from two patients examined by confocal microscopy and microelectrodes were used to measure aerobic/anaerobic respiration and acid production (dissolved oxygen, nitrous oxide, pH) when exposed to saliva following addition of sucrose and fluoride.

Results

Morphologically, tonsilloliths were similar to dental biofilms, containing corncob structures, filaments, and cocci. Microelectrodes showed that the microorganisms respired oxygen and nitrate. The oxygen concentration in the center of the tonsillolith was depleted to approximately one-tenth of that of the overlying fluid. The addition of sucrose resulted in acid production within the tonsillolith, dropping the pH from 7.3 to 5.8. The data showed stratification with oxygen respiration at the outer layer of tonsillolith, denitrification toward the middle, and acidification toward the bottom. The depletion of oxygen and acid production following addition of sucrose may allow the proliferation of anaerobic/acidophilic bacteria. Fluoride suppressed acid production in the presence of sucrose.

Conclusions

Tonsilloliths exhibit biofilm structure and the formation of chemical gradients through physiological activity. Although tonsillectomy is an option for treating cryptic infections, understanding the morphology and biofilm characteristics of tonsilloliths may stimulate scientists to use limited or targeted remedies in the future.

### Coblation cryptolysis method in treatment of tonsil caseum-induced halitosis [^112sdQe5]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Halitosis, is a social problem affecting many patients seeking help from clinicians. Tonsil stones can cause halitosis and especially occur in crypts of palatine tonsils. Coblation cryptolysis is an alternative method for tonsil caseum treatment. The coblation technology includes passing a radiofrequency bipolar electrical current through a medium of normal saline which results in the production of a plasma field of sodium ions. In this study, our aim was to investigate the effectiveness of coblator cryptolysis treatment method in chronic caseous tonsillitis-induced halitosis.

Methods

We included in our study 28 patients who underwent coblator cryptolysis surgery for halitosis due to chronic caseous tonsillitis. The efficacy of treatment and the presence of caseoma were evaluated with the Finkelstein test, organoleptic test and VAS before the procedure and at the 6th month control after the treatment was completed.

Results

At the 6th month follow-up after the procedure (a single coblation cryptolysis) we found that 23 of the patients (82.1%) had no caseum. There was a statistically significant change in Finkelstein measurements before and after the procedure (p < 0.001). Organoleptic measurements demonstrated that 21 patients had no halitosis postoperatively and the mean organoleptic test score was calculated as 0.39 ± 0.79 after the procedure. The recovery was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The mean VAS score before coblation cryptolysis was 8.0 ± 1.33 (range 5–10). On the other hand 6 months after a single coblation cryptolysis session, the mean VAS score was 1.25 ± 1.78 (range: 0–6). This difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Our results suggest that coblation crptolysis is an effective, safe, minimally invasive and practical alternative method in treatment of halitosis due to tonsil caseums. We did not observe any complication after the procedure.

### Adenoid stones, an unknown culprit in pediatric throat pain [^115LBXdG]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

We present a case of a 12-year-old male who presented with complaints of nasal congestion, intermittent throat pain, and odynophagia. He was taken to the operating room for inferior turbinate reduction and adenoidectomy and found to have stones within adenoid crypts. Adenoidectomy resulted in resolution of the patient's throat pain and pain with swallowing. Not previously described in the literature, adenoid stones may represent an unrecognized etiology of odynophagia and throat pain in the pediatric population. Adenoidectomy should be considered for patients symptomatic from adenoid stones.

### Novel findings on the development and immunological functions of palatine tonsils [^113Naznc]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

The palatine tonsils, positioned at the aerodigestive crossroads, serve as immunological sentinels orchestrating frontline defense through coordinated surveillance of inhaled and ingested antigens. As secondary lymphoid organs, palatine tonsils bridge innate and adaptive immunity via specialized microanatomical domains. Recent paradigm shifts now position the tonsils as dual-function immunological entities: while essential for pathogen surveillance and mucosal immunity, their dysregulated immune responses may paradoxically drive systemic inflammation. Concurrently, emerging evidence demonstrates therapeutic implications of tonsillar modulation, particularly through precision interventions such as tonsillectomy. This review examines recent advances in tonsillar anatomy and histology while critically evaluating novel insights into their pathogenic involvement in autoimmune diseases and other extra-tonsillar disorders. Furthermore, we analyze evolving perspectives on tonsil-targeted therapies as potential disease-modifying strategies. The synthesis underscores the tonsils' evolving status from regional lymphoid tissue to systemic immunomodulatory organ, bridging mucosal defense mechanisms with systemic inflammatory pathogenesis.

### Transoral sonographic diagnosis of tonsilloliths: report of 3 cases [^116bxofU]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Tonsilloliths are calcified concretions that develop in tonsillar crypts. They are usually asymptomatic; however, they may cause problems such as halitosis, dysphagia, a globus sensation, and otalgia. Tonsilloliths may be diagnosed by a simple inspection or palpation of tonsillar crypts, which can be confirmed by panoramic radiography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. We report 3 cases of tonsilloliths diagnosed by transoral sonography that was performed easily and comfortably in an office-based setting.

### What's new with tubes, tonsils, and adenoids? [^113WMGYs]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based recommendations are constantly being updated for various pediatric surgical procedures, including the role for tympanostomy tubes, as well as indications for adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy. With a growing body of research available on some of the most prevalent pediatric conditions, an update on the current concepts surrounding management is warranted.

### Practice guidelines for the perioperative management of patients with obstructive sleep apnea: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative management of patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^116vGUHG]. Anesthesiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for obstructive sleep apnea, more specifically with respect to physical examination, ASA 2014 guidelines recommend to recognize that tonsil size may be associated with disease severity, as measured by apnea-hypopnea index, in adult patients with OSA.

### Fishbone foreign body ingestion in duodenal papilla: a cause of abdominal pain resembling gastric ulcer [^114BcNxS]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

Fishbone is the most common foreign body among the population in Asia, the Mediterranean, and other coastal countries due to dietary habits. Generally, it is recommended to remove fishbone before they pass through the pylorus, otherwise 15–35% of them may perforate the intestine. The frequent lodging sites of fishbones in the upper digestive tract are palatine tonsil, base of the tongue, valleculae, the piriform sinus and the first narrow area of esophagus. It has been reported in a case that a toothpick was inserted into the common bile duct, but fishbone inserted into the duodenal papilla was never reported. Since the fishbone in our case was long and thin and very similar to a toothpick, we speculated that the fishbone might also be inserted into the common bile duct.

Patients with duodenal papillary foreign body may go through the acute stage and the chronic stage. At the acute stage, if there is a clear history of foreign body ingestion, the diagnosis is quick but the treatments may be different. Ouzhu M reported a dental prosthesis impacted in the duodenal papilla, which was then removed through endoscopy. Dias R also reported a metal pin removed by a surgical exploration of the duodenum. If the patients do not report a history of foreign body ingestion, both diagnosis and treatment will be difficult. Some foreign bodies may cause acute pancreatitis, while others may lead to ascending cholangitis. In addition, at the acute stage, some foreign bodies might be misdiagnosed as choledocholithiasis. At the chronic stage, some foreign bodies might form biliary stones, which may cause the cholangitis or cholecystitis. Moreover, the foreign body may also cause chronic pancreatitis.

### Stress-related disorders among young individuals with surgical removal of tonsils or adenoids [^112QDtg7]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is undergoing surgical removal of tonsils or adenoids in early life associated with increased subsequent risk of stress-related disorders?

Findings

In this cohort study of 1 050 287 children and young adults in Sweden, those who underwent surgical removal of tonsils or adenoids exhibited a higher risk of stress-related disorders, especially posttraumatic stress disorder, compared with unexposed individuals or unexposed full siblings.

Meaning

These findings suggest a potential role of adenotonsillar diseases or associated health conditions in the development of stress-related disorders.

### Tonsillitis [^112ajYBc]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The definition of severe recurrent throat infections is arbitrary, but recent criteria have defined severe tonsillitis as: five or more episodes of true tonsillitis a year; symptoms for at least 1 year; and episodes that are disabling and prevent normal functioning. Diagnosis of acute tonsillitis is clinical, and it can be difficult to distinguish viral from bacterial infections. Rapid antigen testing has a very low sensitivity in the diagnosis of bacterial tonsillitis, but more accurate tests take longer to deliver results. Bacteria are cultured from few people with tonsillitis. Other causes include infectious mononucleosis from Epstein-Barr virus infection, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, HIV, hepatitis A, and rubella.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of tonsillectomy in children and adults with acute recurrent or chronic throat infections? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 10 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: cold-steel tonsillectomy and diathermy tonsillectomy.

### Peritonsillar abscess: complication of acute tonsillitis or Weber's glands infection? [^115rm58v]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature concerning the 2 primary hypotheses put forth to explain the pathogenesis of peritonsillar abscess: "the acute tonsillitis hypothesis" (peritonsillar abscess is a complication of acute tonsillitis) and "the Weber gland hypothesis" (peritonsillar abscess is an infection of Weber's glands).

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE.

Review Methods

Data supporting or negating one hypothesis or the other were elicited from the literature.

Conclusions

Several findings support the acute tonsillitis hypothesis. First, the 2 main pathogens in peritonsillar abscess have been recovered from pus aspirates and bilateral tonsillar tissues with high concordance rates, suggesting that both tonsils are infected in patients with peritonsillar abscess. Second, studies report signs of acute tonsillitis in the days prior to and at the time of peritonsillar abscess. Third, antibiotic treatment reduces the risk of abscess development in patients with acute tonsillitis. However, some findings suggest involvement of the Weber's glands in peritonsillar abscess pathogenesis. First, high amylase levels have been found in peritonsillar pus. Second, the majority of peritonsillar abscesses are located at the superior tonsillar pole in proximity of the Weber's glands. We propose a unified hypothesis whereby bacteria initially infect the tonsillar mucosa and spread via the salivary duct system to the peritonsillar space, where an abscess is formed.

Implications For Practice

Our findings support the rationale for antibiotic treatment of patients with severe acute tonsillitis to reduce the risk of abscess development. Improved understanding of peritonsillar abscess pathogenesis is important for the development of efficient prevention strategies.

Conclusions

Surgical removal of tonsils and adenoids is associated with a modestly increased risk of cancer during the decades following the surgery. The association is unlikely attributed to confounding due to shared genetic or non-genetic factors with a family.

### Review: known, emerging, and remerging pharyngitis pathogens [^114miVT2]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pharyngitis is an inflammatory condition of the pharynx and/or tonsils commonly seen in both children and adults. Viruses and bacteria represent the most common encountered etiologic agents — yeast/fungi and parasites are infrequently implicated. Some of these are predominantly observed in unique populations (eg, immunocompromised or unvaccinated individuals). This article (part 1 of 3) summarizes the impact of acute pharyngitis on the health care system and reviews the etiologic agents of acute pharyngitis, including both emerging and reemerging pathogens that health care providers should consider when evaluating their patients. Finally, it sets the stage for parts 2 and 3, which discuss the current and evolving state of diagnostic testing for acute pharyngitis.

### A unifying theory of tonsillitis, intratonsillar abscess and peritonsillar abscess [^1131ULoW]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2015). Low credibility.

We review existing models of the pathogenesis of peritonsillar abscess (PTA) and intra-tonsillar abscess (ITA) and present a novel pathophysiologic model based upon observed histopathology in 2 ITAs and 10 PTAs and acute tonsillitis cases. ITA is rare, and prevailing models are only able to account for a minority of cases. The tonsillar lymphatic ultrastucture and the rapid nature of intratonsillar lymphatic transit, offer the framework for a unifying model of the development and progression of tonsillitis, PTA and ITA.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children [^111t8WHa]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with more than 530,000 procedures performed annually in children younger than 15 years. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil including its capsule by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Depending on the context in which it is used, it may indicate tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy, especially in relation to sleep-disordered breathing. This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care and management of children 1 to 18 years old under consideration for tonsillectomy. In addition, this guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children 1 to 18 years of age who may be candidates for tonsillectomy.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to provide clinicians with evidence-based guidance in identifying children who are the best candidates for tonsillectomy. Secondary objectives are to optimize the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasize the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improve counseling and education of families of children who are considering tonsillectomy for their child, highlight the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reduce inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care.

Results

The panel made a strong recommendation that clinicians should administer a single, intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. The panel made a strong recommendation against clinicians routinely administering or prescribing perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. The panel made recommendations for (1) watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been fewer than 7 episodes in the past year or fewer than 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years or fewer than 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years; (2) assessing the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in statement 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergy/intolerance, periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis, or history of peritonsillar abscess; (3) asking caregivers of children with sleep-disordered breathing and tonsil hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that might improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, and behavioral problems; (4) counseling caregivers about tonsillectomy as a means to improve health in children with abnormal polysomnography who also have tonsil hypertrophy and sleep-disordered breathing; (5) counseling caregivers that sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management; (6) advocating for pain management after tonsillectomy and educating caregivers about the importance of managing and reassessing pain; and (7) clinicians who perform tonsillectomy should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy hemorrhage at least annually. The panel offered options to recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year or at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and 1 or more of the following: temperature > 38.3°C, cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A β-hemolytic streptococcus.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^115q8DWH]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillar structure, immune function, and effects of tonsillitis/tonsillectomy — The palatine tonsils are lymphoepithelial organs located at the junction of the oral cavity and oropharynx, and the greatest immunologic activity of the tonsils is found between the ages of 3 and 10 years. While all 5 immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes are produced in the palatine tonsils, IgA is arguably the most important product of the tonsillar immune system. With recurrent tonsillitis, the controlled process of antigen transport and presentation is altered due to shedding of the M cells from the tonsil epithelium; nevertheless, there are no studies to date that demonstrate a significant clinical impact of tonsillectomy on the immune system.

### Radiology quiz case 2: diagnosis… [^115Z6mAJ]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

C. DOUGLASPHILLIPSMD Tonsilloliths, or tonsil stones, are calcified bodies that develop in enlarged tonsillar crypts that are packed with bacteria and organic debris. 1 They arise as a result of dystrophic calcification in the crypts of the palatine tonsils owing to chronic inflammation of the tonsils. They are usually single and unilateral but occasionally may be multiple or bilateral. They are composed of calcium salts such as hydroxyapatite or calcium carbonate apatite, oxalates, and other magnesium salts and ammonium radicals2 and are usually of small size, although there have been occasional reports of large tonsilloliths or calculi in peritonsillar locations. Small stones are asymptomatic, but large tonsilloliths can produce a variety of symptoms, eg, halitosis, referred otalgia, and foreign body sensation in the throat, and some may mimic an abscess or neoplasia.

Tonsilloliths are difficult to diagnose in the absence of definite clinical symptoms and are often incidentally found on radiographs and computed tomograms that have been obtained for other purposes. Computed tomography might sometimes be necessary, especially when the lesion is covered by a mandibular ramus in a plain film. It is also helpful in distinguishing tonsilloliths from pathologic calcifications of arteries, lymph nodes, and salivary glands; displaced mandibular molars; or other anatomical structures of the pharyngeal region. 3 A review of the literature revealed that the present case might indeed represent one of the largest tonsilloliths reported to date. It is not surprising to note that such large tonsilloliths can cause dysphagia.

### Halitosis [^115mvskB]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Halitosis can be caused by oral disease, or by respiratory tract conditions such as sinusitis, tonsillitis, and bronchiectasis, but an estimated 40% of affected individuals have no underlying organic disease.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with physiological halitosis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to July 2008 (BMJ Clinical evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found five systematic reviews, RCTs or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: artificial saliva; cleaning, brushing or scraping the tongue; diet modification; regular or single use of mouthwash; sugar-free chewing gums; and zinc toothpastes.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update)-executive summary [^111JxXht]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2011 guideline developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations on the pre-, intra-, and postoperative care and management of children 1 to 18 years of age under consideration for tonsillectomy. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil, including its capsule, by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with 289,000 ambulatory procedures performed annually in children < 15 years of age, based on the most recent published data. This guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children who may be candidates for tonsillectomy.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing children under consideration for tonsillectomy and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to educate clinicians, patients, and/or caregivers regarding the indications for tonsillectomy and the natural history of recurrent throat infections. Additional goals include the following: optimizing the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasizing the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improving the counseling and education of families who are considering tonsillectomy for their children, highlighting the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reducing inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care. Children aged 1 to 18 years under consideration for tonsillectomy are the target patient for the guideline. For this guideline update, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of nursing, anesthesiology, consumers, family medicine, infectious disease, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, and sleep medicine.

Key Action Statements

The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following key action statements (KASs): (1) Clinicians should recommend watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been < 7 episodes in the past year, < 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or < 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years. (2) Clinicians should administer a single intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (3) Clinicians should recommend ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or both for pain control after tonsillectomy. The guideline update group made recommendations for the following KASs: (1) Clinicians should assess the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in KAS 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance, PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis), or history of > 1 peritonsillar abscess. (2) Clinicians should ask caregivers of children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing and tonsillar hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that may improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, asthma, and behavioral problems. (3) Before performing tonsillectomy, the clinician should refer children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing for polysomnography if they are < 2 years of age or if they exhibit any of the following: obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, or mucopolysaccharidoses. (4) The clinician should advocate for polysomnography prior to tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing in children without any of the comorbidities listed in KAS 5 for whom the need for tonsillectomy is uncertain or when there is discordance between the physical examination and the reported severity of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing. (5) Clinicians should recommend tonsillectomy for children with obstructive sleep apnea documented by overnight polysomnography. (6) Clinicians should counsel patients and caregivers and explain that obstructive sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management. (7) The clinician should counsel patients and caregivers regarding the importance of managing posttonsillectomy pain as part of the perioperative education process and should reinforce this counseling at the time of surgery with reminders about the need to anticipate, reassess, and adequately treat pain after surgery. (8) Clinicians should arrange for overnight, inpatient monitoring of children after tonsillectomy if they are < 3 years old or have severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 10 obstructive events/hour, oxygen saturation nadir < 80%, or both). (9) Clinicians should follow up with patients and/or caregivers after tonsillectomy and document in the medical record the presence or absence of bleeding within 24 hours of surgery (primary bleeding) and bleeding occurring later than 24 hours after surgery (secondary bleeding). (10) Clinicians should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy bleeding at least annually. The guideline update group made a strong recommendation against 2 actions: (1) Clinicians should not administer or prescribe perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (2) Clinicians must not administer or prescribe codeine, or any medication containing codeine, after tonsillectomy in children younger than 12 years. The policy level for the recommendation about documenting recurrent throat infection was an option: (1) Clinicians may recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year, at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years, or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and ≥ 1 of the following: temperature > 38.3°C (101°F), cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.

Differences From Prior Guideline

Incorporating new evidence profiles to include the role of patient preferences, confidence in the evidence, differences of opinion, quality improvement opportunities, and any exclusion to which the action statement does not apply. There were 1 new clinical practice guideline, 26 new systematic reviews, and 13 new randomized controlled trials included in the current guideline update. Inclusion of 2 consumer advocates on the guideline update group. Changes to 5 KASs from the original guideline: KAS 1 (Watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection), KAS 3 (Tonsillectomy for recurrent infection with modifying factors), KAS 4 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing), KAS 9 (Perioperative pain counseling), and KAS 10 (Perioperative antibiotics). Seven new KASs: KAS 5 (Indications for polysomnography), KAS 6 (Additional recommendations for polysomnography), KAS 7 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea), KAS 12 (Inpatient monitoring for children after tonsillectomy), KAS 13 (Postoperative ibuprofen and acetaminophen), KAS 14 (Postoperative codeine), and KAS 15a (Outcome assessment for bleeding). Addition of an algorithm outlining KASs. Enhanced emphasis on patient and/or caregiver education and shared decision making.

### Tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy versus non-surgical treatment for chronic / recurrent acute tonsillitis [^1139QbJo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical removal of the tonsils, with or without adenoidectomy (adeno-/tonsillectomy), is a common ENT operation, but the indications for surgery are controversial. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 3, 1999 and previously updated in 2009.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of tonsillectomy (with and without adenoidectomy) in children and adults with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis in reducing the number and severity of episodes of tonsillitis or sore throat.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 30 June 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) with non-surgical treatment in adults and children with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

This review includes seven trials with low to moderate risk of bias: five undertaken in children (987 participants) and two in adults (156 participants). An eighth trial in adults (40 participants) was at high risk of bias and did not provide any data for analysis. Good information about the effectiveness of adeno-/tonsillectomy is only available for the first year following surgery in children and for a shorter period (five to six months) in adults. We combined data from five trials in children; these trials included children who were 'severely affected' (based on the specific 'Paradise' criteria) and less severely affected. Children who had an adeno-/tonsillectomy had an average of three episodes of sore throats (of any severity) in the first postoperative year, compared to 3.6 episodes in the control group; a difference of 0.6 episodes (95% confidence interval (CI) -1 to -0.1; moderate quality evidence). One of the three episodes in the surgical group was the 'predictable' one that occurred in the immediate postoperative period. When we analysed only episodes of moderate/severe sore throat, children who had been more severely affected and had adeno-/tonsillectomy had on average 1.1 episodes of sore throat in the first postoperative year, compared with 1.2 episodes in the control group (low quality evidence). This is not a significant difference but one episode in the surgical group was that occurring immediately after surgery. Less severely affected children had more episodes of moderate/severe sore throat after surgery (1.2 episodes) than in the control group (0.4 episodes: difference 0.8, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.9), but again one episode was the predictable postoperative episode (moderate quality evidence). Data on the number of sore throat days is only available for moderately affected children and is consistent with the data on episodes. In the first year after surgery children undergoing surgery had an average of 18 days of sore throat (of which some - between five and seven on average - will be in the immediate postoperative period), compared with 23 days in the control group (difference 5.1 days, 95% CI 2.2 to 8.1; moderate quality evidence). When we pooled the data from two studies in adults (156 participants), there were 3.6 fewer episodes (95% CI 7.9 fewer to 0.70 more; low quality evidence) in the group receiving surgery within six months post-surgery. However, statistical heterogeneity was significant. The pooled mean difference for number of days with sore throat in a follow-up period of about six months was 10.6 days fewer in favour of the group receiving surgery (95% CI 5.8 fewer to 15.8 fewer; low quality evidence). However, there was also significant statistical heterogeneity in this analysis and the number of days with postoperative pain (which appeared to be on average 13 to 17 days in the two trials) was not included. Given the short duration of follow-up and the differences between studies, we considered the evidence for adults to be of low quality. Two studies in children reported that there was "no statistically significant difference" in quality of life outcomes, but the data could not be pooled. One study reported no difference in analgesics consumption. We found no evidence for prescription of antibiotics. Limited data are available from the included studies to quantify the important risks of primary and secondary haemorrhage.

Authors' Conclusions

Adeno-/tonsillectomy leads to a reduction in the number of episodes of sore throat and days with sore throat in children in the first year after surgery compared to (initial) non-surgical treatment. Children who were more severely affected were more likely to benefit as they had a small reduction in moderate/severe sore throat episodes. The size of the effect is very modest, but there may be a benefit to knowing the precise timing of one episode of pain lasting several days - it occurs immediately after surgery as a direct consequence of the procedure. It is clear that some children get better without any surgery, and that whilst removing the tonsils will always prevent 'tonsillitis', the impact of the procedure on 'sore throats' due to pharyngitis is much less predictable. Insufficient information is available on the effectiveness of adeno-/tonsillectomy versus non-surgical treatment in adults to draw a firm conclusion. The impact of surgery, as demonstrated in the included studies, is modest. Many participants in the non-surgical group improve spontaneously (although some people randomised to this group do in fact undergo surgery). The potential 'benefit' of surgery must be weighed against the risks of the procedure as adeno-/tonsillectomy is associated with a small but significant degree of morbidity in the form of primary and secondary haemorrhage and, even with good analgesia, is particularly uncomfortable for adults.

### Review: diagnostic potential for collaborative pharyngitis biomarkers [^112qihkp]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Pharyngitis is an inflammatory condition of the pharynx and/or tonsils commonly seen in both children and adults. Viruses and bacteria represent the most common encountered etiologic agents-yeast/fungi and parasites are infrequently implicated. Some of these are predominantly observed in unique populations (eg, immunocompromised or unvaccinated individuals). This manuscript (part 3 of 3) summarizes the current state of biomarker diagnostic testing and highlights the expanding role they will likely play in the expedited diagnosis and management of patients with acute pharyngitis. Biomarkers, in conjunction with rapid antigen and/or nucleic acid amplification testing, will likely become the standard of care to accurately diagnose the etiologic agent(s) of pharyngitis. This novel testing paradigm has the potential to guide appropriate patient management and antibiotic stewardship by accurately determining if the cause of pharyngitis is due to a viral or bacterial etiology.

Abstract

Pharyngitis is an inflammatory condition of the pharynx and/or tonsils commonly seen in both children and adults. Viruses and bacteria represent the most common encountered etiologic agents — yeast/fungi and parasites are infrequently implicated. Some of these are predominantly observed in unique populations (eg, immunocompromised or unvaccinated individuals). This manuscript (part 3 of 3) summarizes the current state of biomarker diagnostic testing and highlights the expanding role they will likely play in the expedited diagnosis and management of patients with acute pharyngitis.

### PROSPECT guideline for tonsillectomy: systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^116Ciaws]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Why was this guideline developed?

Tonsillectomy is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures and pain management remains challenging. The aim of this procedure‐specific guideline is to provide clinicians with up‐to‐date evidence for optimal pain management in tonsillectomy, and recommendations made based on this evidence, adverse effects and considerations regarding risks of interventions. Although other guidelines for tonsillectomy pain management are available, none have used the procedure‐specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) methodology to critically evaluate the available literature. This includes a systematic evidence‐based approach, the inclusion of a basic analgesic regimen for efficacy evaluation, a balance between efficacy and safety and a Delphi process for the final recommendations with international surgeons and anaesthetists involved.

Clinical practice guideline — scope and limitations state that the guideline is not intended as an exhaustive source of guidance and is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies, is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals and may not provide the only appropriate approach, and that clinical indicators and guidelines are promoted as conditional and provisional proposals that are not absolute; guidelines are not mandates, do not purport to be a legal standard of care, and the responsible physician must determine the appropriate treatment based on the individual patient.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^114ZVvvc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillectomy in children — evidence-based statement categories define three levels with corresponding implied obligations: Strong recommendation — A strong recommendation means that the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms and that the quality of the supporting evidence is high, and clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Recommendation — A recommendation means that the benefits exceed the harms but the quality of evidence is not as high, and clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. Option — An option means that either the quality of evidence is suspect or well-done studies show little clear advantage to one approach versus another, and clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### Why is there No statement regarding partial intracapsular tonsillectomy (tonsillotomy) in the new guidelines? [^1114Bet8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Partial intracapsular tonsillectomy (PIT) was revisited in 2003 as an alternate surgical option to total tonsillectomy for the treatment of tonsillar hypertrophy. However, evaluation of the existing literature on PIT reveals that it is largely focused on comparing perioperative outcomes after PIT and total tonsillectomy, with few data regarding long-term outcomes. The goal of this commentary is to explain why PIT was not incorporated into the 2019 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation clinical practice guideline for tonsillectomy, while acknowledging its use and potential advantages and disadvantages and outlining future research opportunities.

Head and neck examination — The provider will look in your mouth and throat with a bright light, and if you wear dentures you will need to remove them; the provider may use gauze to hold your tongue and feel the surfaces of the mouth, tongue, tonsils, or the back of your tongue. The provider may use a small mirror in your mouth to see the voice box, and if a "scope" is needed may first numb the nose and throat, then place a small tube in your nose and use a camera to examine your throat; you may have mild discomfort.

### Triprolidine and pseudoephedrine hydrochlorides and codeine phosphate syrup (triacin-C) [^113DNpjV]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General: Triacin-C should be prescribed with caution for certain special-risk patients, such as the elderly or debilitated, and for those with severe impairment of renal or hepatic function, gallbladder disease or gallstones, respiratory impairment, cardiac arrhythmias, history of bronchial asthma, prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture, and in patients known to be taking other antitussive, antihistamine or decongestant medications. Patients' self-medication habits should be investigated to determine their use of such medications. Triacin-C is intended for short-term use only.

Information For Patients:

Advise patients that some people have a genetic variation that results in codeine changing into morphine more rapidly and completely than other people. Most people are unaware of whether they are an ultra-rapid codeine metabolizer or not. These higher-than-normal levels of morphine in the blood may lead to life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression or signs of overdose such as extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing. Children with this genetic variation who were prescribed codeine after tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy for obstructive sleep apnea may be at greatest risk based on reports of several deaths in this population due to respiratory depression. As a result, codeine is contraindicated in all children who undergo tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Advise caregivers of children receiving codeine for other reasons to monitor for signs of respiratory depression (see WARNINGS – Death Related to Ultra-Rapid metabolism of Codeine to Morphine).

### Association between the microbiomes of tonsil and saliva samples isolated from pediatric patients subjected to tonsillectomy for the treatment of tonsillar hyperplasia [^112Ybxjy]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Based on the collective results, we have expanded our understanding of the interactions between the microbiomes of saliva and tonsils. Several factors are responsible for the loss of microbial diversity and homeostatic function, including inflammation, diet, xenobiotics, and altered host cell function. Given its critical roles in multiple diseases, the microbiome has become an extremely attractive target for therapeutic interventions. One of the biggest hurdles in microbiome research is the identification of cause-effect relationships and the design of microbiome-based therapies that are able to achieve predictable effects on the microbial community and host cell function. Further studies are required to develop strategies aimed at modulating the microbiome profile to improve host function and health.

In conclusion, the analysis of the microbiomes of paired tonsil and saliva samples from Korean pediatric patients diagnosed with hyperplasia without tonsillitis revealed that many bacterial communities are shared and show similarities in terms of diversity and composition, suggesting close interactions between the two microbial groups. Although further studies are clearly essential, we assume that the oral microbiome exerts significant effects on not only the tonsil itself but also the tonsil-derived immune or stem cells by regulating the microbial community. Our preliminary study may serve as a cornerstone in that it sheds light on the possibility of future research on novel microbiome-based therapeutic tactics using tonsil-derived cells or a tonsil-related microenvironment.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^114Vrioh]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillectomy in children — definition, scope, and epidemiology — is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil by dissecting the peritonsillar space; the guideline targets children aged 1 to 18 years under consideration for tonsillectomy and is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children who may be candidates; tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with 289,000 ambulatory procedures performed annually in children < 15 years of age.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^111h4gkF]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Efficacy and effectiveness of tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection show short-term benefits that diminish over time. Evidence "suggest[s] a modest but statistically significant reduction in frequency of throat infection among severely affected patients undergoing tonsillectomy for 1 year but no longer". In a trial meeting strict episode criteria, "the tonsillectomy group experienced a mean rate reduction of 1.9 episodes per year in the first year of follow-up", whereas controls had "a mean rate reduction of 0.5 to 1 episodes per year". For moderate or severe episodes, controls had "1.2 episodes in the first year versus 0.1 in the surgical group".

### Gizmo is a mean word! [^114zGne4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The editorial titled "Gizmos" in the April issue of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery was unfortunate. Intracapsular tonsillectomy is a rational surgical option for managing tonsillar hypertrophy causing obstructive sleep apnea in selected children. It is performed routinely by surgeons across the globe and has become the standard of care across northern Europe due to the high safety profile of the operation. The semirigid, dartlike design of the sinuplasty devices suggested the idea for an airway-specific set of high-pressure balloons. We began working on these in 2007 and had FDA approval in 2009. They are in wide use by many airway surgeons. Lingual tonsils are a frequent cause of obstructive sleep apnea, and there is no tool that manages this as effectively as endoscopic plasma ablation. We are all engaged in an honorable effort to improve care; surgical and creative skills are as important as analytical skills. Both are necessary for the continuous improvement of our work. Both are worthy of respect.

Tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection in children — evidence profile and policy level — is supported by "Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B…; some Grade C observational studies", with "Level of confidence in evidence: Medium". Benefits note that "Patients who proceed with the option of tonsillectomy will achieve a modest reduction in the frequency and severity of recurrent throat infection for 1 year after surgery and a modest reduction in frequency of group A streptococcal infection for 1 year after surgery", while "Risks, harms, costs" include surgical morbidity and direct and indirect costs. The "Benefits-harm assessment" is a "Balance between benefit and harm", "Role of patient preferences" is "Large role for shared decision making", and the "Policy level: Option". The group held "near consensus" but "1 member… felt that tonsillectomy should not be recommended", with some preferring to list both tonsillectomy and watchful waiting as options.

### Lingual tonsil abscess with parapharyngeal extension: a case report [^115e2u8R]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Lingual tonsil abscess is a rare disorder previously reported only once in the English literature. Because of their similar structure to that of the palatine tonsils, the lingual tonsils have the propensity to develop infection in the same way. The progression of infection, however, is different in that the lingual tonsils lack a capsule, thus preventing the formation of a peritonsillar abscess. Therefore, the only place for infection to spread is either into the tongue or into the parapharyngeal space. Here we present our experience with the latter, and we provide radiographic evidence of the disease. Lingual tonsil abscess, although rare, is an important potential cause of airway obstruction and must be considered in the case of a sore throat with a normal oropharyngeal exam.

### Lingual (not palatine) tonsillolith: case report [^1165x7Sg]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The lingual tonsil (LT), located at the base of the tongue posterior to the circumvallate papillae, consists of aggregates of lymphoid tissue separated by a median glossoepiglottic ligament that splits the LT into right and left halves. Tonsillar tissue on either side of the ligament exhibits discrete round nodules that project upward. Each prominence is covered by nonkeratinized epithelium and has a central crypt formed by an invagination of the overlying epithelium. Ducts of adjacent mucous glands empty into the crypt, serving as a flushing mechanism to cleanse the crypt. A thin fibrous connective tissue capsule isolates the LT from the underlying tongue musculature. Lingual tonsillar tissue tends to regress with aging. Hypertrophy and pathologic changes of the LT can develop and cause subjective symptomatology. Patient complaints include sore throats, dysphagia, globus sensation, dyspnea, obstructive sleep apnea, dysgeusia, halitosis, and otalgia. Tonsilloliths in the palatine tonsil are often reported, but the LT also can develop a tonsillolith. Only 1 report of LT tonsilloliths was found in the English-language dental literature. Because of its literary rarity, this report presents a case of an incidental finding of a lingual tonsillolith. Diagnostic skills are sharpened when such cases are brought to the attention of the profession.

### Updated guideline on treatment and management of craniosynostosis [^111e8quh]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

CHAPTER 10 CHIARI

10.1 What is the management of Chiari in craniosynostosis?

Introduction

The prevalence of Chiari varies considerably depending on the type of craniosynostosis. The prevalence, causes, consequences and need for treatment are often unclear. Chiari is best visualized with an MRI-scan, but there is uncertainty about how often it should be made for the different types of craniosynostosis and when which treatment is indicated.

Search and Selection

For the following specific questions original scientific studies or systematic reviews of scientific studies have been included:

1 How common is Chiari in children with craniosynostosis and what diagnostics are needed to detect it?
2 What are Chiari-specific factors that are considered in the indication for treatment?
3 What are determining factors with regard to the choice of surgical technique, indication and/or timing for the treatment of Chiari?

In the Medline (OVID) and Embase databases, a single comprehensive search was carried out for studies on craniosynostosis. The search strategy is shown in appendix 2, to the guideline. After deduplication, the literature search yielded 2732 hits.

Given the large number of studies, the chair of the working group first selected those that met the following general selection criteria:

The pre-selected studies that met the specific selection criteria listed in the Table below are included in the literature summary of this chapter.

Summary of the Literature

Isolated, non-syndromic craniosynostosis

In the study by Leikola, all 121 patients with isolated, non-syndromic craniosynostosis (90 sagittal, 13 metopic, 11 coronal, 7 lambdoid suture synostosis) had undergone MRI prior to surgery. 1 On analysis, 9 patients (7 sagittal and 2 coronal suture synostosis) had a tonsillar herniation, ranging from 6 to 12 mm, none of whom showed symptoms consistent with a tonsillar herniation. Seven patients received an MRI postoperatively for 27 to 81 months, after which the tonsillar herniation decreased in 4 patients and remained stable in 3 patients. The remaining 2 did not receive an MRI because of a contraindication due to a metal implant and a persistent upper respiratory tract infection. All remained symptom free and no one developed a syrinx.

### Tonsillar hypertrophy and prolapse in a child-is epiglottitis a predisposing factor for sudden unexpected death? [^114gjhAL]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

We report on a case of sudden and unexpected death in an 8-year-old female who was diagnosed with and treated for tonsillitis. Tonsillar hypertrophy was present, and obstruction of the airway was suspected to be the mechanism of death. The child was diagnosed with acute tonsillitis 2 days prior to her collapse and was placed on a course of oral antibiotics (Cefpodoxime) and oral paracetamol at her local clinic, and sent home. She was previously well, with no history of chronic disease or history of allergy. Clinical examination at the time was not suggestive of upper or lower airway obstruction and she was not toxically sick. No bacterial or viral cultures or PCR testing was done, as she presented to a local clinic. During the course of the day preceding her death she was feverish and vomited, but she remained responsive. She was found to be unresponsive and gasping for air by her mother's sister in her own bed in the early hours of the second morning after the start of the antibiotics. Resuscitation efforts at a local medical facility were unsuccessful and death was declared approximately 30 min after arrival at the facility.

A medico-legal autopsy was indicated under South African law as the death was classified as sudden and unexpected. The main external findings at autopsy were that the child was of normal weight and build for age. No fresh injuries or other signs of trauma were present. Both eyes were slightly sunken into the orbits. The tip of the tongue was clenched between the teeth.

Internal examination revealed massive and symmetrically enlarged palatine tonsils (so-called kissing tonsils) with the right tonsil measuring 32 mm × 23 mm × 15 mm and left tonsil 25 mm × 21 mm × 12 mm. The tonsils filled the pharynx almost completely. The right tonsil appeared slightly more mobile at its point of attachment than the left, abutting against the epiglottis. No surface exudate, pseudo-membrane formation or parenchymal haemorrhage were present on the surface, or in the tonsils; the tonsils only appeared slightly hyperaemic. The epiglottis and laryngeal mucosa at the base of the epiglottis in the vicinity of the aryepiglottic membrane and the superior aspect of the larynx displayed red-purple discoloration, with mucosal swelling and edema (Fig. 1). The tonsils were removed with the laryngo-pharyngeal block to preserve the relative position of the structures to each other.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^113ujDK2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillectomy in children — definitions for this guideline include the following: Tonsillectomy is defined as a procedure that completely removes the tonsil including its capsule by dissecting the peritonsillar space; throat infection is a sore throat caused by viral or bacterial infection of the pharynx or palatine tonsils and may or may not be culture positive for group A streptococcus, including strep throat, acute tonsillitis, pharyngitis, adenotonsillitis, or tonsillopharyngitis; obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (oSDB) is a clinical diagnosis with obstructive abnormalities during sleep (snoring, mouth breathing, pauses), spans a spectrum from primary snoring to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), may include daytime inattention, poor concentration, hyperactivity, or excessive sleepiness, and distinguishes from sleep-disordered breathing with central apnea or ventilation abnormalities; OSA is diagnosed when oSDB is accompanied by abnormal polysomnography with an obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 1; caregiver refers to parents, guardians, or other adults providing care to children under consideration for or undergoing tonsillectomy.

### Management of persistent, post-adenotonsillectomy obstructive sleep apnea in children: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1122wysB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Values and preferences

Regardless of whether medical or surgical intervention is chosen, there is probably no important uncertainty about or variability in how much patients/caregivers value the main outcomes that were chosen. There may be cultural norms regarding weight (e.g. some Pacific Islander cultures) that may decrease acceptability for weight loss.

Insurance coverage for medical residential or nonresidential or surgical weight-loss programs may not be readily available. The potential of long-term benefit will have to be weighed against the costs associated with the interventions. Patient/family acceptance is also variable for residential or outpatient intense programs.

Cost/implementation

There were no cost-effectiveness studies identified. For medical interventions, there is limited availability of weight-loss programs, variable coverage of costs, and questionable sustainability once the program is completed. For surgical interventions, the main limitations are cost and surgical candidacy (comorbidities and ability to participate in lifestyle changes to maintain long-term results).

What others are saying

A European Respiratory Society Statement and an AAP guideline for the treatment of OSA in children recommend weight loss in addition to other therapy in children with OSA who are overweight or obese.

Remarks/future research opportunities

There is a need for:

- Randomized controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of medical and surgical weight-loss interventions in children for OSA resolution, QOL, OSA-related morbidity including metabolic data, long-term sustainability of weight loss, as well as cost-effectiveness.
- Studies of patients with Down syndrome undergoing either medical or surgical weight-loss programs.

### Relation between peritonsillar infection and acute tonsillitis: myth or reality? [^115TkjYT]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the relationship between tonsillar and peritonsillar infections.

Study Design

Retrospective population-based study and a retrospective case series review.

Settings

Tertiary academic medical facility.

Subjects and Methods

All individuals hospitalized with peritonsillar abscess (PTA) or peritonsillar cellulitis (PTC) during 2004–2008 were reviewed. Patient age, gender, diagnosis of PTA or PTC, recurrence, and date of presentation were recorded. In addition, a database of patients diagnosed in the community with acute tonsillitis (AT) was reviewed for the same time period. The weekly number of patients with AT was recorded, and a comparison between incidence of tonsillar infections and peritonsillar infection was performed.

Results

A total of 685 patients were hospitalized with either PTA (467) or PTC (218). Incidence of both upper respiratory infections and AT peaked in January and February of every year with a nadir in August. In contrast, PTA and PTC showed a consistent rate of infection throughout the year. Likewise, assessment based on weekly intervals showed that peaks of PTA and PTC did not follow those of acute tonsillitis with a 1 to 2 weekly lag as would be expected if peritonsillar infection is a complication of AT. Rather, an association between peritonsillar infection and tonsillitis was found within the same week (P = 0.04).

Conclusion

Higher rates of occurrence of PTA or PTC following AT outbreaks were not found. These results lend further support to the theory that peritonsillar infection is associated not only with complications of AT but may occur from infection of Weber glands or other unknown causes.

### Laser tonsil cryptolysis: in-office 500 cases review [^114FS5K8]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Tonsilloliths, proven to be tonsillar biofilms cause symptoms of halitosis, foreign body sensation and recurrent sore throats. Laser Tonsil Cryptolysis (LTC) performed in the office may represent an alternative to tonsillectomy in selected cases of persistent tonsilloliths with cryptic infections.

Study Design

A retrospective chart analysis using CPT codes.

Setting

Office and hospital.

Methods

A retrospective complications review consisting of bleeding, the need for an additional procedure, patient satisfaction and conversion rate to complete tonsillectomy was documented.

Results

Five hundred consecutive LTCs performed in the office under local anesthesia with a CO2 or diode laser were identified. Energy delivery was in continuous mode with power settings of 18W and 10W respectively. Bleeding occurred in 6 patients requiring unscheduled return office visit for evaluation. Eighty patients required a second procedure, comprising total of 1.16 procedures per patient. Eighteen (3.6%) patients underwent complete tonsillectomy. Patient satisfaction was high with an overall incidence of 0–2 days of work absence. Follow-up was 1–8 years.

Conclusions

With a small tonsil size, controllable gag reflex and cooperative adult patient LTC allows several advantages compared to conventional tonsillectomy. Benefits of LTC include avoidance of general anesthesia and limited ablation of cryptic pockets, resulting in reduced post-operative pain, bleeding, shorter recovery time and the convenience and cost advantage of an office procedure. With 1.16 sessions required per patient, low conversion rate to standard tonsillectomy and minimal complication rate LTC can be considered an alternative option to a patient suffering from recurrent cryptic tonsillitis with or without tonsilloliths.

### MRI of acute neck infections: evidence summary and pictorial review [^111Z6jn7]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

The peritonsillar space refers to the potential space between the palatine tonsil capsule and the superior constrictor muscle, bounded anteriorly by the palatoglossus muscle (anterior tonsillar pillar) and posteriorly by the palatopharyngeus muscle (posterior tonsillar pillar) (Fig. 2). Therefore, peritonsillar space is in the pharyngeal mucosal space by definition. Peritonsillar abscess (PTA) is a collection of purulent fluid in peritonsillar space, often as a complication of tonsillitis or resulting from minor salivary gland infection (Figs. 14, 15). PTA can be found anywhere in the peritonsillar space. Compared with other locations, superiorly confined PTAs (43% of all, defined relative to the craniocaudal midpoint of the palatine tonsil), occur in younger patients, are more common in females than in males, are smaller, have lower rates of deep extension, and patients have a shorter hospital stay. Conversely, larger PTAs are associated with a more complicated course of illness. Technically, a simple PTA is not considered a deep neck infection and most cases can be managed on clinical grounds with local incision and drainage, without the need for imaging. However, in patients with PTA in whom incision yields no pus ("dry tap"), imaging can help define the extent of infection and accurate localization of abscess. For example, posterior and inferior PTA may not be drainable by simple superior incision. Imaging can also help in planning acute phase tonsillectomy.

### PROSPECT guideline for tonsillectomy: systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^116mWfEs]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The management of post‐tonsillectomy pain can be challenging and often inadequate. Tonsillectomy has been identified as one of the most painful surgical procedures [1], probably because pain remains poorly managed in clinical practice [1, 2, 3]. There are many reasons for undertreating pain after tonsillectomy, including clinicians underestimating the degree of pain associated with tonsillectomy surgery due to the fact that the surgical procedure is considered to be minimally invasive [1]. Moreover, despite numerous studies comparing and combining analgesics to find the most effective postoperative regimen, there is still no consensus on the best treatment strategy. Tonsillectomy is unique for several reasons including the type of tissue trauma, the exposure of the healing wound to movement of the pharynx during ingestion, the risk of bleeding and limitations in the choice of drugs, particularly in children. Thus, the ideal regimen providing adequate analgesia with few side‐effects after tonsillectomy remains to be defined. Guidelines on pain management after tonsillectomy have previously been published [4, 5].

The PROSPECT Working Group is a collaboration of surgeons and anaesthetists working to formulate procedure‐specific recommendations for pain management after common but potentially painful operations [6]. The recommendations are based on a procedure‐specific systematic review of randomised controlled trials. The methodology considers clinical practice, efficacy and adverse effects of analgesic techniques [7].

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available literature on the management of pain after tonsillectomy in both adults and children. Pain scores and analgesic requirements were the primary focus, but other recovery outcomes, including adverse effects, were also assessed when reported, and the limitations of the data were reviewed. The ultimate aim was to develop recommendations for pain management after tonsillectomy.

### Tonsillar hypertrophy and prolapse in a child-is epiglottitis a predisposing factor for sudden unexpected death? [^116orxv9]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Tonsillitis, with associated tonsillar hypertrophy, is a common disease of childhood, yet it is rarely associated with sudden death due to airway obstruction. Lethal complications involving the inflamed tonsils include haemorrhage, retropharyngeal abscess and disseminated sepsis.

Case presentation

We report on a case of sudden and unexpected death in an 8-year-old female who was diagnosed with and treated for tonsillitis. The child was diagnosed with acute tonsillitis 2 days prior to her collapse and was placed on a course of oral antibiotics. There were no signs of upper or lower airway obstruction. She was found to be unresponsive by her caregiver and gasping for air in her bed in the early hours of the second morning after the start of treatment. Autopsy showed massive and symmetrically enlarged palatine tonsils. The tonsils filled the pharynx almost completely. The epiglottis and laryngeal mucosa at the base of the epiglottis in the vicinity of the aryepiglottic membrane and the superior aspect of the larynx displayed red-purple discoloration, with mucosal swelling and edema. Histological examination of the palatine tonsils revealed prominent lymphoid hyperplasia, but no evidence of acute inflammation.

Conclusion

Palatine tonsillar hypertrophy in infants is a common feature of both viral and bacterial tonsillitis and has been postulated as a possible risk factor for Sudden and Unexplained Death in Infancy (SUDI), based on the theory of mechanical impediment of breathing by narrowing of the upper airway. The rounded shape of the tonsils may facilitate some airflow past the enlarged structures and hence protect against asphyxial death when the enlarged tonsils fill the laryngo-pharynx. Epiglottal and proximal laryngeal edema may play a more significant role in asphyxial unexpected deaths in cases of tonsillitis with tonsillar hypertrophy than previously suspected. This focusses the importance of careful examination of the epiglottis and proximal laryngeal mucosa, as part of a thorough examination of the laryngo-pharynx in cases of sudden death associated with tonsillar hypertrophy.

### Time to functional recovery after laser tonsillotomy performed under local anesthesia vs conventional tonsillectomy with general anesthesia among adults: a randomized clinical trial [^113XdxGT]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, tonsillolithiasis, halitosis, dysphagia, and snoring are common tonsil-related conditions in adults. When conservative treatment of these conditions fails, surgery may be indicated.

Classic dissection tonsillectomy with complete tonsil removal under general anesthesia is the most used surgical technique. In the United States and Europe combined, more than 500 000 tonsillectomies are performed in adult patients every year. After tonsillectomy, recovery to normal function is typically long. Postoperative complications of tonsillectomy include bleeding, infection, and severe pain, any of which may lead to hospital readmissions and contribute to a protracted recovery. Partial removal of the tonsil, tonsillotomy, has been performed for 3000 years and is increasingly being reexplored to potentially decrease patient burden and risk. During tonsillotomy, only the cryptic lymphatic tissue is removed, and the tonsil capsule that contains larger nerves and blood vessels is left intact. This may lead to less postoperative pain and bleeding. Tonsillotomy may be performed in adults using different instruments and techniques, including the use of carbon dioxide (CO 2) laser, diathermy, radiofrequency, microdebrider, coblation, bipolar electrosurgical device, and cold steel dissection.

The CO 2 laser is the most used laser modality in tonsillotomy and is known for its good ablation and hemorrhage-controlling characteristics. An advantage of the CO 2 laser is its ability to perform tonsillotomy under local anesthesia without sedation. General anesthesia has additional effects on postoperative and functional recovery, and obviating the need for general anesthesia may provide additional recovery benefit over tonsillectomy. However, there is a lack of evidence with sufficient quality regarding the clinical usefulness of tonsillotomy compared with tonsillectomy in adults.

We conducted a randomized clinical trial to compare CO 2 laser tonsillotomy performed under local anesthesia to tonsillectomy performed under general anesthesia for tonsil-related concerns in adults. We hypothesized that tonsillotomy would have a shorter functional recovery period. Secondary outcomes included relief 6 months after surgery of the primary concern that led to tonsil removal and tonsil symptom severity.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^113Ym1F8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

History < 12 months and observation before tonsillectomy: There are currently no randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of tonsillectomy for patients experiencing recurrent tonsillitis over a period < 12 months, and all required a minimum number of sore throats in the preceding 12 months; for example, in the study by Paradise et al, 62 (33%) of the 187 children who satisfied the Paradise criteria had ≥ 7 throat infections in the preceding 12 months. Because of this tendency to improve with time, at least a 12-month period of observation is recommended prior to consideration of tonsillectomy as an intervention, but this statement should not restrict access to tonsillectomy prior to 1 year of observation when patients may reasonably be considered in circumstances including complications of infection, such as ≥ 2 peritonsillar abscesses.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^1171rkAU]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Balance of benefit versus harm for tonsillectomy in severe recurrent throat infection indicates modest benefit and supports either surgery or watchful waiting with shared decision making. Caregivers and patients who meet the appropriate criteria for tonsillectomy as described here should be advised of only modest anticipated benefits of tonsillectomy, as weighed against the natural history of resolution with watchful waiting, as well as the risk of surgical morbidity and complications and the unknown risk of general anesthesia exposure in children < 4 years of age. The guideline panel agreed that there was not a clear preponderance of benefit over harm for tonsillectomy, even for children meeting the Paradise criteria, and felt there to be a balance that allows either tonsillectomy or watchful waiting as an appropriate management option that does not imply all qualifying children should have surgery; this underscores a substantial role for shared decision making with the child's caregiver and primary care clinician.

Recurrent throat infection — watchful waiting policy attributes emphasize evidence quality, benefits and harms, exclusions, and policy level. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A, systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials that fail to show clinically important advantages of surgery over observation alone; Grade C, observational studies showing improvement with watchful waiting. Level of confidence in evidence: High. Benefits: Avoid unnecessary surgery with potential complications of vomiting, bleeding, pain, infection, or anesthesia problems. Risks, harms, costs: Waiting may result in delayed treatment in patients who have unusually frequent and severe recurrent throat infections; potential direct cost of managing future throat infections. Benefits-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments: Panel consensus that tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection should be limited to circumstances for which clinically important benefits are shown in randomized controlled trials; emphasis on avoiding harm related to surgery or anesthesia in a condition that may be largely self-limited. Intentional vagueness: None. Role of patient preferences: None. Exclusions include patients with > 1 peritonsillar abscess, personal or family history of rheumatic heart disease, Lemierre's syndrome, severe infections requiring hospitalization, or numerous repeat infections in a single household ("ping-pong spread"). Policy level: Strong recommendation. Differences of opinions: None.

### Localized amyloidosis of bilateral palatine tonsils mimicking tonsillolithiasis [^114CNseh]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

A rare disease called localized tonsillar amyloidosis can cause serious problems with airway patency in severe cases. This was the case with an elderly man who experienced difficulty breathing and swallowing due to enlarged palatine tonsils. The physical and imaging findings suggested tonsillolithiasis, and the patient underwent bilateral tonsillectomy. The diagnosis of amyloidosis was confirmed with histopathological examination using Congo red staining. Surgical intervention and careful follow-up care can be effective in these cases, which generally have a good prognosis.

### Laser versus cold steel dissection tonsillectomy in recurrent acute tonsillitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111DKUDv]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Materials and Methods

This systematic review and meta‐analysis were performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The prospective protocol was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) in April 2024 (ID: CRD42024533742).

2.1 Search Strategy

We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to April 10, 2024. The following terms were searched in all three databases: "tonsillectomy", or "tonsil resection", or "tonsil removal", or "adenotonsillectomy", or "extracapsular", and "laser", or "CO2", or "carbon dioxide", or "KTP", or "potassium titanyl phosphate", or "thulium", or "diode", or "Nd:YAG" and "cold", or "steel", or "conventional", or "traditional", or "snare". The complete search strategy is available in the supporting material. Snowballing technique and a complementary search on the website ResearchGate were also performed to identify additional studies.

2.2 Study Selection

Two authors (M.M. and T.D.D.C.) independently screened articles according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved via consensus. Studies were included if they met all the following eligibility criteria, based on the PICOS statement: (1) RCTs or non‐randomized cohorts; (2) enrolling patients with the diagnosis of RAT and candidates for total TE, i.e. complete removal of the tonsils; (3) comparing laser dissection TE to (4) conventional cold steel dissection TE; (5) reporting data on at least one of the outcomes of interest. Studies were excluded if they included patients with conditions other than RAT, or if only a partial or intracapsular TE was performed. There was no restriction on follow‐up time or publication year. We excluded studies (1) with no control group, (2) not peer‐reviewed, and (3) not written in English.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^113V1uyu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillectomy in children — policy and rationale for tracking bleeding outcomes: Benefits-harm assessment indicates a preponderance of benefit over harm with risks, harms, costs limited to administrative burden. Value judgments include perceived heterogeneity among clinicians regarding knowledge of their own bleeding rates after tonsillectomy and the potential to reassess process of care and improve quality. Intentional vagueness acknowledges that specifics of how to determine the bleeding rate and the follow-up process are left to the clinician, but should include a good-faith effort to contact the patient; role of patient preferences and exclusions are none. The policy level is Recommendation, and although the majority supported the statement as written, 2 members were concerned that contacting every patient could be difficult and may not be feasible in every practice setting.

### Long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of laser tonsillotomy vs tonsillectomy: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^111yNyzn]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

Based on results of this randomized clinical trial, CO 2 laser TO appears to be ideal for adult patients prioritizing quicker recovery and less postoperative discomfort. It suits those unable or unwilling to undergo general anesthesia, need minimal disruption to daily activities, or are apprehensive about the invasiveness of TE.

In addition, CO 2 laser TO is recommended for patients with mild to moderate recurrent tonsil-related symptoms, where full tonsil removal may not always be necessary. Although some residual tissue and symptoms may remain, TO significantly reduces symptom severity to clinically nonrelevant levels, with low postoperative risk and low health care cost. Its reduced need for in-hospital care and preservation of tonsillar structure might align better with health care goals of individual patients.

For patients who wish to avoid the possibility of a secondary procedure, traditional TE may be the more appropriate choice. Careful patient selection and counseling about the potential for residual symptoms and a secondary procedure are essential to optimizing outcomes and satisfaction. This personalized approach, backed by the major economic benefits demonstrated in this study, underscores the value of integrating CO 2 laser TO into treatment strategies for persistent tonsil-related afflictions in adults.

This study's long-term follow-up showed that CO 2 laser TO was less effective than TE in fully resolving tonsil issues but led to a substantial decrease in symptoms for all patients with residual symptoms, resulting in similar patient satisfaction. A slight advantage in 2-year QALYs was noted with TE, but CO 2 laser TO was less costly, with lower societal costs due to reduced work absence and productivity loss. Based on these findings, CO 2 laser TO appears to be a safe, effective, and cost-effective method for long-term relief of tonsil-related problems with excellent patient satisfaction.

### Cancer risk following surgical removal of tonsils and adenoids-a population-based, sibling-controlled cohort study in Sweden [^115AKpgT]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

An increased risk of cancer following surgical removal of tonsils and adenoids might be due to multiple reasons. Tonsils and adenoids, as secondary lymphoid organs, produce secondary immune responses through exhibiting specific antibodies and B and T cell activities, demonstrating humoral and cellular immune functions. Removal of lymphoid tissues and its resultant immune-response alterations might therefore contribute to an increased risk of cancer. Alternatively, individuals receiving a surgical removal of tonsils and adenoids might have impaired immune responses to combat the underlying conditions (e.g. hypertrophic tonsils, chronic infection, and recurrent middle ear effusion), regardless of the surgical procedure. Although previous studies failed to demonstrate significant damages to the immune system or showed only a transient decline in immunity subsequent to tonsillectomy, multiple studies have indeed shown an increased risk of autoimmune disease, irritable bowel disease specifically, as well as a collective group of respiratory, allergic, and infectious diseases, demonstrating the presence of immune dysfunction among individuals with a previous tonsillectomy. Finally, the indications of the surgical removal, such as chronic infection, rather than the surgical procedure itself, might increase the risk of certain cancers. An infectious etiology is indeed confirmed for many cancer types, and estimated to be responsible for 10–20% of all human cancers. The similar result on any cancer shown in sensitivity analysis comparing exposed individuals with registered indications for surgical removal of tonsils or adenoids to unexposed individuals with similar diagnoses argues against indication bias as the sole explanation for the observed association. This sensitivity analysis is however not free of bias. For instance, we identified potential indications through registered hospital diagnoses alone and did not have detailed clinical information. As a result, although both groups had diagnoses that could potentially serve as indications for the surgical removal of tonsils and adenoids, individuals that eventually underwent the surgical procedure might have had "real indications" (e.g. severe and persistent symptoms) whereas individuals that did not undergo the surgical procedure might not have had such "real indications" (e.g. milder and transient symptoms) or have had contraindications for the surgical removal of tonsils and adenoids (e.g. anemia, poor anesthetic risk, and acute infection). Such differences might be associated with the risk of cancer in general or the risk of specific cancers (e.g. hematopoietic malignancies), leading to biased results. Regardless, irrespective of the underlying reasons (most likely multifold), this finding is still of substantial public health importance, given the high prevalence of the procedure (11% in the present study population) and the persistently increased risk of cancer more than 20 years after the procedure.

### Pediatric tonsillar pathology: a comprehensive ultrasonographic approach [^115ofTUD]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Palatine tonsils are part of the Waldeyer's ring and consist of lymphoid tissue. As a first-line immune system mechanism, they act against entering pathogens. They recognize and initiate an immune response to exogenous antigens. Tonsillar disease in children, particularly inflammatory conditions, is well known in the medical community. Inflammatory diseases include conditions such as tonsillitis and peritonsillar cellulitis and other more complicated diseases such as intratonsillar abscess, peritonsillar abscess, and parapharyngeal abscess. Their treatment varies, with more severe cases often requiring intervention when antibiotic therapy is insufficient. Prompt differential diagnosis should be performed to prevent the misdiagnosis of life-threatening conditions, including neoplastic disease, which may present with clinical and imaging findings mimicking an inflammatory process. An intraoral or transcutaneous ultrasonographic approach in such patients can help differentiate cases that eventually require intervention, without the risk of ionizing radiation. This article aims to analyze the ultrasound findings of normal tonsillar tissue and to categorize abnormal findings indicative of tonsillar disease.

### Previous tonsillectomy modifies odds of tonsil and base of tongue cancer [^113sDVWE]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

An exploratory analysis of the association between tonsillectomy, tonsil, and BOT cancer, and HPV status yielded interesting results. When both subsite and HPV status were considered, we demonstrated that tonsillectomy was associated with a significantly decreased odds of HPV-positive tonsil cancer and a decreased but insignificant odds of HPV-negative tonsil cancer. The weaker association between tonsillectomy and HPV-negative tonsil cancer may result from susceptibility of nonlymphoid tissues of the tonsillar region (anterior tonsillar pillars, posterior tonsillar pillars, and tonsillar fossa) to HPV-negative, tobacco-associated cancer even in the setting of previous tonsillectomy. Ultimately, the decrease in odds of tonsil cancer in patients with a history of tonsillectomy is expected and logical. The association by HPV status should be explored further in larger studies. With respect of HPV-positive and HPV-negative BOT cancer, our data suggest that the association between tonsillectomy and an increased odds of BOT cancer is strongest for HPV-positive tumours. The reason for this difference by HPV status remains unclear and warrants further investigation, and may reflect a relatively small sample size of HPV-negative tumours.

Recently, the possibility of prophylactic tonsillectomy as a method of secondary OPSCC prevention has been considered. Although we demonstrate a reduction in overall risk of OPSCC cancer associated with tonsillectomy, our study was not designed to address this question. It is important to consider that despite being a commonly performed surgery, the morbidity of tonsillectomy is not insignificant. Furthermore, as demonstrated by), the relative rarity of OPSCC further precludes tonsillectomy from being an effective method of prevention. Vaccination against high-risk HPV types has the potential to serve as a safer and more effective method of primary prevention of OPSCC than tonsillectomy. Nonetheless, when considered along with other covariates such as sexual history, smoking status, and age, a history of tonsillectomy may play a role in risk stratification.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^113HoxsB]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillectomy modifying factors — modifying factors are defined within 3 categories: "(1) exceptions to recognized criteria based on individual features (eg, multiple antibiotic allergies); (2) specific clinical syndromes, such as PFAPA or recurrent tonsillitis associated with peritonsillar abscess; and (3) poorly validated clinical indications (eg, halitosis, febrile seizures, and malocclusion)". For category 1, "tonsillectomy is efficacious in reducing the number and severity of subsequent infections for at least 2 years when children fulfill stringent criteria for recurrent sore throat", and when episodes are very severe or poorly tolerated, medication allergies complicate therapy selection, or absences interfere with school performance, "surgery with its attendant reduction of episodes of illness may be recommended".

### PROSPECT guideline for tonsillectomy: systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^111GSon6]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

How does this guideline differ from other guidelines?

The French Oto‐Rhino‐Laryngology Head and Neck Surgery Society [1] and Ericsson et al. [2] published guidelines for post‐tonsillectomy pain management in adults in 2014 and children in 2015, respectively. Both made recommendations based on expert consensus within the respective national societies based on published literature. These vary from the present guidelines in the process of our literature search, the use of a Delphi study to ratify our recommendations and we include contemporary studies from the last 5 years that are not included in previous guidelines. Moreover, previous guidelines do not highlight the importance of baseline analgesia. The PROSPECT approach to developing guidelines is unique such that the available evidence is critically assessed for current clinical relevance and the use of simple, non‐opioid analgesic such as paracetamol and NSAIDs as basic analgesics are considered. This approach reports clinical effectiveness by balancing the invasiveness of the analgesic interventions and the degree of pain after surgery, as well as balancing efficacy and adverse effects.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^115Lsdxr]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Randomized trial limitations and evidence grading — when weighing tonsillectomy for recurrent infection, limitations of the evidence include small randomized samples and incomplete follow-up, prompting a downgrade in evidence level. Limitations of the available randomized controlled trials must also be considered when assessing the benefits and harms of surgery. Paradise and colleagues randomized 91 children to surgery versus observation after screening thousands, only a small percentage met strict entry criteria and only about half of eligible children agreed to randomization, and in both studies only about half (46%-62%) of enrolled children completed all 3 years of follow-up. Although these limitations did not invalidate the trials, the panel downgraded the aggregate evidence level from A (randomized trials) to B (randomized trials with limitations).

### Time to functional recovery after laser tonsillotomy performed under local anesthesia vs conventional tonsillectomy with general anesthesia among adults: a randomized clinical trial [^113VpBpt]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Resolution of Tonsil-Related Symptoms

Six months after randomization to tonsillotomy or tonsillectomy, the chief concern persisted in 54 of 94 patients (57%) after tonsillotomy and in 25 of 71 patients (35%) after tonsillectomy (difference 95% CI, 7%-37%; P = 0. 005) (Table 2). For patients with remaining concerns, the severity of the chief concern decreased significantly both in the tonsillotomy (mean [SD] baseline, 57.6 [18.1] vs follow-up, 37.6 [22.1]; effect size 0.88; P = 0. 01) and tonsillectomy (mean [SD] baseline, 54.4 [13.6] vs 23.9 [11.3] follow-up; effect size 2.24; P = 0. 01) groups. Most patients with persistent symptoms in both the tonsillotomy (32 of 54; 59%) and tonsillectomy (16 of 25; 64%) groups reported mild symptoms 6 months after surgery. When measured on a continuous scale of 0 to 100, patients with persistent symptoms in the tonsillotomy group reported slightly higher symptom severity compared with the tonsillectomy group (mean [SD], 38 [22] vs 26 [13] mm; effect size 0.66; P = 0. 02). For patients with remaining tonsil concerns, the distribution of the chief concern leading to surgery was similar to the baseline distribution among patients in the tonsillotomy group (baseline: sore throat without fever, 31 [32%]; sore throat with fever, 33 [34%]; tonsillolithiasis, 32 [33%]; snoring, 2 [2%]; and dysphagia 0 [0%] vs persistent symptoms: sore throat without fever, 16 [30%]; sore throat with fever, 14 [26%]; tonsillolithiasis, 23 [43%]; snoring, 1 [2%]; and dysphagia, 0 [0]%; P = 0. 64) and in the tonsillectomy group (baseline: sore throat without fever, 33 [33%]; sore throat with fever, 33 [33%]; tonsillolithiasis, 32 [32%]; snoring, 2 [2%]; and dysphagia, 1 [1%] vs sore throat without fever, 9 [36%]; sore throat with fever, 8 [32%]; tonsillolithiasis, 6 [24%]; snoring, 2 [8%]; and dysphagia, 0 [0%]; P = 0. 52), indicating that the type of tonsil concern did not influence treatment success.

### Plain language summary for patients: tonsillectomy in children [^116PLjr7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

This plain language summary for patients serves as an overview explaining tonsillectomy in children and to help patients, caregivers, and clinicians in their discussions about the reasons that a tonsillectomy may be needed, management options, and care related to the procedure. This summary applies to patients ages 1 through 18 years and is based on the 2019 "Clinical Practice Guideline: Tonsillectomy in Children (Update)". This evidence-based guideline mainly addresses the need for tonsillectomy based on breathing problems that take place during sleep and repeated sore throats or "tonsillitis". The guideline was developed to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing children under consideration for tonsillectomy and to create clear recommendations for clinicians to use in medical practice.

### Tonsillectomy and adenotonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection in moderately affected children [^111d8Dng]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

In previous clinical trials involving children severely affected with recurrent throat infection (7 or more well-documented, clinically important, adequately treated episodes of throat infection in the preceding year, or 5 or more such episodes in each of the 2 preceding years, or 3 or more such episodes in each of the 3 preceding years), we found tonsillectomy efficacious in reducing the number and severity of subsequent episodes of throat infection for at least 2 years. The results seemed to warrant the election of tonsillectomy in children meeting the trials' stringent eligibility criteria but also provided support for nonsurgical management. We undertook the present trials to determine 1) whether tonsillectomy would afford equivalent benefit in children who were less severely affected than those in our earlier trials but who nonetheless had indications for tonsillectomy comparable to those in general use, and 2) whether, in such children, the addition of adenoidectomy would confer additional benefit.

Methods

We conducted 2 parallel randomized, controlled trials in the Ambulatory Care Center of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. To be eligible, children were required to have had a history of recurrent episodes of throat infection that met standards slightly less stringent than the standards used in our earlier trials regarding either the frequency of previous episodes or their clinical features or their degree of documentation, but not regarding > 1 of those parameters. These reduced standards were nonetheless more stringent than those in current official guidelines, which list "3 or more infections of tonsils and/or adenoids per year despite adequate medical therapy" as an indication for tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy. Of 2174 children referred by physicians or parents, 373 met the current trials' eligibility criteria and 328 were enrolled. Of these, 177 children without obstructing adenoids or recurrent or persistent otitis media were randomized to either a tonsillectomy group, an adenotonsillectomy group, or a control group (the 3-way trial), and 151 children who had 1 or more such conditions were randomized to either an adenotonsillectomy group or a control group (the 2-way trial). Outcome measures were the occurrence of episodes of throat infection during the 3 years of follow-up; other, indirect measures of morbidity; and complications of surgery.

Results

By various measures, the incidence of throat infection was significantly lower in surgical groups than in corresponding control groups during each of the 3 follow-up years. However, even among control children, mean rates of moderate or severe episodes were low, ranging from 0.16 to 0.43 per year. Adenotonsillectomy was no more efficacious than tonsillectomy alone. Of 203 children treated with surgery, 16 (7.9%) had surgery-related complications of varying types and severity.

Conclusions

The modest benefit conferred by tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy in children moderately affected with recurrent throat infection seems not to justify the inherent risks, morbidity, and cost of the operations. We conclude that, under ordinary circumstances, neither eligibility criteria such as those used for the present trials nor the criterion for surgery in current official guidelines are sufficiently stringent for use in clinical practice.

### The role of tonsillectomy in reducing recurrent pharyngitis: a systematic review [^114mcFkM]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the evidence for efficacy of tonsillectomy in reducing the incidence of recurrent pharyngitis.

Data Sources

Literature databases consisting of PUBMED, SCOPUS, CINHAL AND OVID EMBASE including all languages.

Review Methods

Literature search of database by 2 authors with structured criteria using an online database. Selected studies evaluated with meta-analysis.

Results

In four randomized, controlled trials tonsillectomy was favored over medical therapy in reducing pharyngitis. The difference was statistically significant in only one study. Overall meta-analysis results were significant, indicating that tonsillectomy results in a reduction of about 43% in the incidence of pharyngitis. The number needed to treat with tonsillectomy to prevent one sore throat per month for the first year after surgery was 11 (95% CI; 7–23).

Conclusion

Tonsillectomy reduces the incidence of recurrent pharyngitis to a modest degree.

### Palatine tonsil size and its correlation with subjective tonsil size in patients with sleep-disordered breathing [^111SJrzJ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the correlation of subjective tonsil size with real palatine tonsil size and to compare the differences of each parameter according to subjective tonsil size and between children and adults.

Study Design

Prospective evaluation of subjective tonsil size (0–4+) and real palatine tonsil size, including tonsil height (TH), tonsil width (TW), tonsil thickness (TT), total tonsil volume (TTV), and embedded tonsil volume (ETV) within the tonsillar fossa.

Setting

Tertiary-care rhinologic clinic.

Subjects and Methods

We measured TH, TW, TT, TTV, and ETV in 277 children and 63 adults with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB).

Results

In both children and adults, subjective tonsil size was significantly correlated with TTV, TH, TW, and TT (correlation coefficients 0.199–0.427 for children and 0.462–0.551 for adults). In children, TTV increased in proportion to subjective tonsil size, but about 45 percent and 34 percent of tonsils markedly deviated from the mean value of their TTV in size 2 and 3 groups, respectively. In adults, TTV of subjective tonsil size 3 and 4 groups was significantly larger than that of size 1 and 2 groups.

Conclusions

Real palatine tonsil size correlated with subjective tonsil size in both children and adults with SDB. Although there is a statistical correlation in children between TTV and subjective tonsil size, there is significant discordance in size 2 and 3 groups, thus greatly limiting the value of subjective tonsil size assessment in the majority of children. However, adult subjective tonsil size may reflect real palatine tonsil size and may help predict it preoperatively.

This study has limitations. One important limitation is the uneven distribution of patients between the tonsillotomy and tonsillectomy groups who received their randomized treatment. We postulate that the higher patient withdrawal rate in the tonsillectomy group reflected the real-world hesitation to undergo tonsillectomy among patients. We emphasize that this withdrawal is not outcome dependent and therefore should not bias our results unless prognosis of the withdrawn patients differs from the general population. We compared the characteristics listed in Table 1 between patients who received treatment and patients who withdrew from the randomized surgical treatment and found no significant differences between groups, except for percentage of patients who were employed (78% vs 50%; P = 0. 02). Thus, we have no indication that withdrawal biased our results. We also note that our modified intention-to-treat analysis of functional recovery and our intention-to-treat analysis of long-term follow-up symptom resolution represent real-world estimates of patient burden and treatment effect on symptoms.

We found no indication that the type of tonsil concern influenced treatment success. However, our study was likely underpowered to find any difference in specific subgroups. Further research should be conducted to assess potential differences.

The incidence of postoperative hemorrhage in the tonsillectomy group was higher than previously reported from retrospective studies. We believe that part of the higher postoperative hemorrhage rate in the present study may be attributed to our strict follow-up, which included questions directly related to complications, including postoperative hemorrhage. Other prospective studies have similar unexpected high rates of postoperative hemorrhages after cold steel dissection tonsillectomy.

Finally, in the present study, patients with peritonsillar abscesses and patients with an indication for histopathologic analysis of the excised tonsil tissue (eg, to rule out malignant neoplasm) were excluded, and therefore the results of this trial do not apply to these populations. We recommend that patients with peritonsillar abscess be treated with tonsillectomy owing to the risk of recurrence of abscesses and the potentially lethal complications. Potential residual tonsil tissue after tonsillotomy in those cases is not desirable. Furthermore, when histopathologic analysis is required, laser tonsillotomy is not suitable because all of the tissue is evaporated by laser heating.

### Surgical removal of tonsils and risk of COVID-19: a nested case-control study using data from UK biobank and AMORIS cohort [^1122SPAn]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization declared an end of the COVID-19 pandemic as a global health emergency in May 2023; however, globally, millions of people continue to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and thousands of people continue to die from the disease each week. The identification of individuals at high risk of COVID-19, especially severe cases, therefore, remains crucial.

The palatine tonsils are secondary lymphoid organs at the mucosal surface of the oropharynx and nasopharynx, playing an important role in infections of the upper respiratory tract. Tonsils are immunologically active in childhood and atrophy with age. Tonsillectomy is the most common otorhinolaryngological surgery, mainly performed to treat tonsillar inflammation or obstructive sleep apnea. Given the role of tonsils in respiratory infections, a potential link has been proposed between previous tonsillectomy and susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and severity. Three studies have so far examined COVID-19 in relation to tonsillectomy. One study showed that individuals with tonsillectomy had a lower-than-expected rate of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity, whereas no association was observed between tonsillectomy and disease severity. Another study showed that, among people with a positive COVID-19 test, individuals with tonsillectomy had a higher burden of some symptoms, but not others, as well as a similar risk of hospitalization compared to those without tonsillectomy. The third study showed that, among patients with chronic tonsillitis, chronic adenoiditis, or peritonsillar abscess, an inverse association was noted between tonsillectomy and COVID-19, as well as mortality, although the former was not statistically significant.

As the existing studies are either relatively small or focused on individuals with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 or clinical indications for tonsillectomy, we examined the association of tonsillectomy with the subsequent risk of COVID-19 with different severity in the general population, using prospectively collected data from the UK Biobank and the Swedish Apolipoprotein-Related Mortality Risk (AMORIS) Cohort. In addition, we investigated potential effect modifiers (i.e. sex, age, socioeconomic status, and genetic risk score for critically ill COVID-19) and mediators (e.g. blood inflammatory, lipid and metabolic biomarkers) for the association.

### Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy-pediatric clinics of north America [^1173trUs]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy are among the most commonly performed major pediatric operations in the United States, with more than 500,000 procedures performed annually. This procedure can be performed with or without adenoidectomy. These procedures were traditionally performed for recurrent tonsillitis; however, the vast majority of tonsillectomies are currently performed for obstructive symptoms. When performed for appropriate indications, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy can greatly improve a child's quality of life and general health. Given the prevalence of these conditions and subsequent surgical procedures, evidence-based recommendations are regularly evaluated and updated. As such, familiarity with these guidelines is necessary for pediatric practitioners. This review summarizes the indications, complications, and outcomes for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, as well as provides a brief overview of operative techniques.

### Bilateral peritonsillar abscess: case report and literature review [^117SkuSa]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2011). Low credibility.

Although uncommon, bilateral peritonsillar abscess (PTA) may still present with symptoms found in unilateral cases but lack hallmark findings such as an asymmetric tonsillar bulge and uvular deviation. We present the case of an 18-year-old woman deemed to have a bilateral PTA based on physical examination and radiographic imaging. She underwent successful surgical drainage with needle aspiration, followed by incision and drainage. A computed tomography with intravenous contrast should be obtained when a patient displays signs suggestive of a bilateral PTA but the diagnosis is not certain. To our knowledge, this is the first report of 2 different bacterial species cultured from contralateral abscesses during the same encounter.

### A new era in the treatment of calcium oxalate stones? [^112rtijF]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Calcium oxalate (CaOx) is the most prevalent type of kidney stone. The amount of oxalate excreted in the urine is a major risk factor for CaOx stone formation. The study by Siener et al. makes a substantial contribution to our understanding of how Oxalobacter formigenes affects oxalate metabolism and excretion in humans and hence influences the risk of developing CaOx kidney stones.
