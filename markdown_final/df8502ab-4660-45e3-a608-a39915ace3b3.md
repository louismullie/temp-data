## Question

Blood shot eyes virus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "bloodshot eyes virus", specifically the viral causes of red eye and their diagnosis and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the terminology and scope. Then, I should categorize the viral etiologies that cause red eye. Next, I will review the clinical features that help distinguish viral from bacterial conjunctivitis. After that, I need to consider special populations and red flags. Then, I will outline diagnostic steps, including when to test and what to test. Finally, I will synthesize management principles, prevention, and follow-up, making sure to verify each claim against guidelines and high-quality evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't anchor on a vague phrase. "Bloodshot eyes" in clinical usage corresponds to conjunctival hyperemia, most commonly due to conjunctivitis, which is overwhelmingly viral in adults and mixed in children, so I should frame the discussion around viral conjunctivitis while keeping broader differentials in mind for red eye presentations [^1138Wf4y] [^112ByJSW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single virus; I need to categorize the viral causes that produce red eye. Common community causes include adenovirus, herpesviruses (HSV, VZV), and enteroviruses such as coxsackie A24 causing acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, while emerging systemic viruses like SARS-CoV-2, dengue, Zika, West Nile, Ebola, and Rift Valley fever can also present with ocular involvement including conjunctival injection, chemosis, or retinal disease, so travel and exposure history matter [^1138Wf4y] [^115qcwPj] [^113DozE4] [^112rVSRx] [^117Wrc44] [^1117PMLn] [^111G6twC].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical discriminators between viral and bacterial conjunctivitis because misclassification drives overtreatment. Viral conjunctivitis typically shows watery discharge, bilateral involvement, follicles on exam, and may be associated with URI symptoms or preauricular lymphadenopathy, whereas bacterial conjunctivitis more often has mucopurulent discharge, eyelid matting, and is more common in children; however, no single sign is definitive, so I should be cautious and integrate multiple features before labeling [^112ByJSW] [^1138Wf4y] [^114ZswsT].

> I should double-check the epidemiology to avoid overgeneralizing. In adults, viral conjunctivitis predominates, whereas in children bacterial etiologies are more frequent; this age gradient helps calibrate pretest probabilities, but I still need to examine carefully for atypical features or red flags that would change management or urgency [^112ByJSW].

> Next, I should review special populations and red flags so I don't miss sight-threatening disease. Contact lens wearers with a painful red eye raise concern for keratitis and warrant urgent ophthalmology, immunocompromised patients are at risk for HSV keratitis or CMV retinitis, and neonates with conjunctivitis require urgent evaluation for gonococcal or chlamydial infection. Systemic viral illnesses like dengue, Ebola, or COVID-19 can present with ocular signs and should be considered in the right epidemiologic context [^113X36wt] [^112zRgJV] [^113DozE4] [^1117PMLn] [^112rVSRx] [^114ZswsT].

> Let me think about diagnostic strategy and testing thresholds. For typical mild cases, diagnosis is clinical and testing is not routinely required; however, if disease is severe, recurrent, atypical, or in high-risk hosts, I should consider conjunctival swabs for PCR or culture, and in suspected CMV retinitis or posterior segment disease, intraocular fluid PCR can be decisive because blood testing has poor positive predictive value for ocular disease; I need to ensure I don't over-rely on serum PCR for ocular CMV [^112zRgJV].

> I will now examine management principles, and I should confirm that I'm aligned with guidelines. Supportive care is first-line for viral conjunctivitis: preservative-free artificial tears, cold compresses, and strict hygiene with avoidance of eye rubbing and sharing of personal items; topical antibiotics do not help viral disease and should be avoided unless bacterial coinfection is suspected or the clinical course suggests otherwise, and I should counsel on contagion and return precautions [^114aP5sv] [^114LJtjF] [^114ZswsT].

> But wait, what if the presentation is HSV keratitis or acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis; I need to ensure I don't miss those. HSV keratitis presents with pain, photophobia, and branching dendritic epithelial defects and requires prompt antiviral therapy to prevent scarring, whereas acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis from enterovirus 70 or coxsackie A24 causes rapid-onset painful red eye with subconjunctival hemorrhages and is managed supportively with strict infection control given its high transmissibility [^111hY21y] [^115qcwPj].

> Hold on, I should verify prevention and public health measures because viral conjunctivitis is highly contagious. Hand hygiene is paramount, patients should avoid touching or rubbing the eyes, and shared towels, pillows, or cosmetics should be avoided. In outbreak settings or residential facilities, symptom-based restrictions and hygiene education reduce transmission, and in healthcare, eye protection reduces exposure risk when caring for patients with respiratory viruses or hemorrhagic fevers [^114LJtjF] [^11755Euo] [^111Jyz2p].

> I need to ensure follow-up and referral triggers are explicit. Most cases resolve in 1–2 weeks, but urgent ophthalmology referral is indicated for severe pain, vision loss, corneal involvement, suspected keratitis, anterior uveitis, acute angle closure, scleritis, orbital cellulitis, or failure to improve within a few days. Virtual consultation can triage many cases, but red flags mandate same-day ophthalmic assessment [^113X36wt] [^115FXmnz].

> Let me reconsider the initial premise to make sure I haven't overlooked anything. "Bloodshot eyes virus" is best understood as viral conjunctivitis within the broader differential of red eye, with adenovirus most common in adults, enteroviruses causing acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, and systemic viruses like SARS-CoV-2, dengue, and Ebola adding ocular manifestations. Accurate history, careful exam, judicious testing in atypical or high-risk cases, supportive care, and vigilant infection control form the backbone of safe, evidence-based care [^1138Wf4y] [^113DozE4] [^112rVSRx] [^1117PMLn].

---

Bloodshot eyes from viral infection are most often due to **adenovirus** [^1138Wf4y] (acute viral conjunctivitis), with other causes including HSV [^1138Wf4y], VZV, enteroviruses [^115qcwPj], and SARS-CoV-2 [^112rVSRx]. Key features are **watery discharge**, conjunctival injection, and preauricular nodes [^112ByJSW]; diagnosis is clinical, with PCR reserved for severe or atypical cases [^notfound]. Management is **supportive** [^114ZswsT] (lubricants, cold compresses, strict hygiene) [^114ZswsT]; antibiotics are not indicated unless bacterial co-infection is suspected [^114aP5sv]. Most cases resolve in 1–2 weeks [^1138Wf4y], but refer urgently for severe pain, vision changes, corneal involvement, or immunocompromise [^113X36wt].

## Clinical features distinguishing viral from bacterial conjunctivitis

- **Discharge**: Viral conjunctivitis typically presents with a clear, watery discharge, whereas bacterial conjunctivitis presents with a thick, purulent discharge [^1138Wf4y].

- **Lymphadenopathy**: Preauricular lymphadenopathy is more common in viral conjunctivitis [^112ByJSW].

- **Laterality**: Viral conjunctivitis often starts in one eye and spreads to the other within a few days, whereas bacterial conjunctivitis can be unilateral or bilateral [^115uvDcV].

- **Associated symptoms**: Viral conjunctivitis is frequently associated with upper respiratory tract symptoms, such as cough, nasal congestion, and sore throat [^1138Wf4y].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis is primarily **clinical** [^116ZAFRG], based on history and examination. Laboratory tests are not routinely required but may be useful in atypical or severe cases:

- **Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)**: PCR testing of conjunctival swabs can identify specific viral pathogens, such as adenovirus, HSV, or SARS-CoV-2 [^112rVSRx].

- **Viral culture**: Rarely used due to slow turnaround time and limited availability [^114UAb65].

- **Serological testing**: Not routinely recommended but may be considered in specific cases, such as suspected HSV or VZV infection [^notfound].

---

## Treatment and management

There is **no specific antiviral therapy** for most cases of viral conjunctivitis; management is supportive:

- **Supportive care**: Lubricating eye drops, cold compresses, and strict hygiene measures (frequent handwashing, avoiding eye rubbing, and not sharing personal items) [^114ZswsT] [^114LJtjF].

- **Antibiotics**: Not indicated unless bacterial co-infection is suspected or confirmed [^114aP5sv].

- **Antiviral therapy**: Reserved for specific viral infections, such as HSV or VZV, and should be prescribed by an ophthalmologist [^111hY21y].

- **Patient education**: Emphasize the contagious nature of viral conjunctivitis and the importance of hygiene to prevent transmission [^11755Euo].

---

## Potential complications

Although most cases resolve spontaneously, complications can occur, particularly in immunocompromised individuals or those with pre-existing ocular conditions:

- **Corneal involvement**: Keratitis, corneal ulcers, or scarring, particularly with HSV or VZV infections [^111hY21y].

- **Secondary bacterial infection**: Can prolong the course of disease and require antibiotic treatment [^117PHnwK].

- **Chronic conjunctivitis**: Persistent inflammation or scarring, particularly with adenovirus or enterovirus infections [^notfound].

- **Vision loss**: Rare but possible, particularly with severe corneal involvement or untreated complications [^111hY21y].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention of viral conjunctivitis relies on **strict hygiene** and **avoidance of exposure**:

- **Hand hygiene**: Frequent handwashing with soap and water or alcohol-based sanitizers [^114LJtjF].

- **Avoidance of eye rubbing**: Reduces risk of autoinoculation [^notfound].

- **Personal items**: Do not share towels, pillowcases, or eye makeup [^114LJtjF].

- **Contact lens hygiene**: Proper cleaning and disinfection of contact lenses and avoiding lens wear during active infection [^111hY21y].

- **Isolation**: Avoid close contact with infected individuals, particularly in outbreak settings [^11755Euo].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Patients should seek **medical attention** if they experience:

- **Severe pain or photophobia**: Suggests corneal involvement or more serious ocular disease [^113X36wt].

- **Vision changes**: Blurred vision, double vision, or loss of vision [^113X36wt].

- **Severe discharge or corneal opacity**: Indicates potential bacterial co-infection or corneal involvement [^115y7vo5].

- **Immunocompromised state**: Increased risk of complications and severe disease [^114ZswsT].

- **Persistent symptoms**: Symptoms lasting longer than two weeks without improvement [^1138Wf4y].

---

Bloodshot eyes from viral infection are most often due to adenovirus, with other causes including HSV, VZV, enteroviruses, and SARS-CoV-2. Diagnosis is **clinical**, with supportive care as the mainstay; antibiotics are not indicated unless bacterial co-infection is suspected. Most cases resolve in 1–2 weeks, but complications can occur, so patients should seek care for severe pain, vision changes, or persistent symptoms [^1138Wf4y].

### Bacterial conjunctivitis [^1138yYZy]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Most cases of conjunctivitis in adults are probably due to viral infection, but children are more likely to develop bacterial conjunctivitis than they are viral forms. The main bacterial pathogens are Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults and children, and Moraxella catarrhalis in children. Contact lens wearers may be more likely to develop gram-negative infections. Bacterial keratitis occurs in up to 30 per 100,000 contact lens wearers.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of antibiotics in adults and children with bacterial conjunctivitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to January 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 35 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following intervention: topical antibiotics.

### Bedside diagnosis of the 'red eye': a systematic review [^111Kvxas]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with red eye, traditional teachings suggest that photophobia, visual blurring, and eye pain indicate serious eye disease; in patients with presumed conjunctivitis, the finding of purulent drainage traditionally indicates a bacterial cause. The accuracy of these teachings is unknown.

Methods

A MEDLINE search was performed to retrieve articles published between 1966 and April 2014 relevant to the bedside diagnosis of serious eye disease and bacterial conjunctivitis.

Results

In patients with red eye, the most useful findings indicating serious eye disease are anisocoria (with the smaller pupil in the red eye and difference between pupil diameters > 1 mm; likelihood ratio [LR], 6.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.6–16.3) and photophobia, elicited by direct illumination (LR, 8.3; 95% CI, 2.7–25.9), indirect illumination (LR, 28.8; 95% CI, 1.8–459), or near synkinesis test ("finger-to-nose convergence test", LR, 21.4; 95% CI, 12–38.2). In patients with presumed conjunctivitis, complete redness of the conjunctival membrane obscuring tarsal vessels (LR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.2–17.1), observed purulent discharge (LR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.7–9.1), and matting of both eyes in the morning (LR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.9–6.5) increase the probability of a bacterial cause; failure to observe a red eye at 20 feet (LR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0–0.8) and absence of morning gluing of either eye (LR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1–0.8) decrease the probability of a bacterial cause.

Conclusions

Several bedside findings accurately distinguish serious from benign eye disease in patients with red eye and, in patients with presumed conjunctivitis, distinguish bacterial from viral or allergic causes.

### Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the ocular route [^113AaBKD]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Another possible route is hematogenous metastasis. Based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in the retina of deceased COVID-19 patients, the possibility of blood transmission is worth considering. Once reaches the ocular surface, SARS-CoV-2 could invade the conjunctiva and iris under the mediation of ACE2 and CD147, another possible receptor for SARS-CoV-2 on host cells. De Figueiredo et al described the following possible pathways. After reaching blood capillaries and then choroid plexus, the virus reaches the blood-retinal barrier (BRB), which expresses both ACE2 and CD147 in retinal pigment epithelial cells and blood vessel endothelial cells. Since CD147 mediates the breakdown of neurovascular blood barriers, the virus can cross the BRB and enter into blood. Although the hematogenous metastasis of SARS-CoV-2 from the ocular surface may exist theoretically, more clinical or experimental evidence is needed to verify.

The above nasolacrimal route and blood metastasis explain the possible paths of virus transfer from ocular surface, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 may not be localized to the eyes after its invasion into the conjunctiva.

### Red eyes and red-flags: improving ophthalmic assessment and referral in primary care [^112LfBMB]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Problem

Between two and five percent of all presentations to general practice are ophthalmic in nature. Red eye is the descriptive term representing inflammation of the anterior segment resulting in vasodilation of the superficial blood vessels, and is the most common ocular presentation in general practice. In most cases, the cause is benign. However, sometimes a red eye may indicate a sight-threatening, or in extreme cases, a life-threatening condition. According to the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE), the benign conditions include bacterial, viral, and allergic conjunctivitis, episcleritis, and subconjunctival haemorrhage. These make up about 70% of the primary care red eye consultations, and are subsequently over-diagnosed. The more common sight-threatening causes of a red eye include keratitis, scleritis, acute glaucoma, foreign body trauma, chemical burns, and orbital cellulitis. Studies have demonstrated that accurate diagnosis of eye conditions is achieved between 16% and 36% of the time, and up to 12% of those misdiagnosed experience adverse outcomes as a result.

In order to ensure that patients attending primary care services with a red eye are managed appropriately and safely, the NICE 'Red Eye' Clinical Knowledge Summary (CKS) specifies that the doctor must 'always document the history and findings of an eye examination (including negative findings). Pain, photophobia, visual acuity, and whether the condition is unilateral or bilateral, are the essential elements to be documented'. The clinician should refer the patient for same-day specialist assessment by an ophthalmologist if any red flag features are present.

The aim of this project was to ensure that an assessment for red-flag features was performed in every patient presenting to their GP with a red eye, and those with red-flag features were appropriately referred to same-day ophthalmology services, as recommended by NICE in the 'Red Eye' CKS. The timeframe within which improvement was to be demonstrated was initially set at eight weeks. The setting was a primary care health centre, located in Tower Hamlets, serving a local population of over 13,000 patients.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern ® [^114aP5sv]. Ophthalmology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for infectious conjunctivitis, more specifically with respect to topical antibiotics, AAO 2019 guidelines recommend to avoid prescribing topical antibiotics indiscriminately, as viral conjunctivitis will not respond to antibacterial agents, and mild bacterial conjunctivitis is likely to be self-limited and typically resolves spontaneously without specific treatment in immunocompetent adults.

### Platelet transfusion related panophthalmitis and endophthalmitis in patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever [^115mBQBs]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Dengue is a vector-borne viral illness of major public health importance. It is endemic in many parts of India and also causes frequent epidemics. Platelet transfusions are given in severe cases of dengue fever to treat and prevent hemorrhagic complications. Here, we report three patients in North India with development of panophthalmitis and endophthalmitis shortly after receiving platelet transfusion.

### Ocular manifestations of emerging viral diseases [^115GgpFP]. Eye (2021). Medium credibility.

Crimean Congo* (Nairoviridae)

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is an enveloped, circular, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus in the Nairoviridae family, which causes an acute viral haemorrhagic fever. Transmission of the virus is primarily through tick bites belonging to the genus Hyalomma, which are widely distributed in Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe. Transmission is also reported to occur by contact with patients or animals with a high viral load, thus posing a high risk of transmission in healthcare environments.

An estimated 90% of patients are oligo- or asymptomatic whilst the remaining 10% can present with the more severe form of disease described in many studies. The disease manifests as sudden onset fever, myalgia and dizziness. Some develop gastro-intestinal symptoms such as vomiting and stomach pain. After 3–5 days, the haemorrhagic phase starts including bleeding (severe bruising and epistaxis), confusion and hepatomegaly. Fatality rates for hospitalised patients are documented as ranging from 9 to 50%.

Only one study has formally characterised the ocular findings in CCHFV patients after previous studies reported conjunctival injection and photophobia. In a case series of 19 patients, none had ocular complaints, but examination showed that 14 (73.7%) had ocular abnormalities. Subconjunctival haemorrhage was present in 12 (63.2%) patients and retinal haemorrhage was present in 7 (36.8%) patients. Subconjunctival haemorrhage was petechial, occurring most often at the nasal quadrant and peri-limbal area of both eyes. Retinal haemorrhage was dot-like or triangular at the paramacular and peripapillary area. The ocular findings did not appear to correlate with disease severity. Both types of haemorrhage had resolved completely at 1 month follow-up. The results of this small study indicate that CCHF should be considered in the differential when subconjunctival or retinal haemorrhages are seen along with fever in travellers from endemic areas.

Diagnosis is via serum RT-PCR in the early stages of disease or ELISA late in disease and treatment is largely supportive with some evidence that ribavirin shows some benefit. After people of working age exposed to tick populations, healthcare workers are the second most-affected group. Knowledge of CCHFV may therefore help prevent nosocomial spread of the virus.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^1158fAMP]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Molluscum contagiosum — ocular surface disease: Conjunctivitis and keratitis from molluscum contagiosum are due to viral shedding from the eyelid lesion(s) onto the surface of the eye. Molluscum lesions may spontaneously resolve, but they can also persist for months to years. Treatment to remove the lesions is indicated in symptomatic patients, with options including incision and curettage (aggressive enough to cause bleeding), simple excision, excision and cautery, and cryotherapy. In patients with multiple lesions, care should be taken to identify and treat nascent lesions in order to reduce the risk of recurrence, but reduction of the viral load often allows the host immunologic response to eliminate residual virus. The conjunctivitis may require weeks to resolve after elimination of the lesion. In adults, large and multiple molluscum lesions with relatively little conjunctival inflammation may indicate an immunocompromised state. Follow-up is not usually necessary unless the conjunctivitis persists, and referral to a dermatologist may be necessary for examination of other suspicious lesions.

### Retinitis after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation with multiple intraocular viral infections (cytomegalovirus, epstein ‒ barr virus and herpes simplex virus)-a case report [^114ECvMA]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

The patient's aqueous humour was positive for CMV, HSV and EBV DNA, but her blood was negative for CMV and EBV at the time of ocular symptoms. The patient's blood has never been positive for EBV since her initiation of EBV testing. Although EBV virus is not detected in the blood, the virus is likely to be latent in the body. It has been reported in the literature that EBV virus can be detected in about 20% of cadaveric eye tissues. This may have contributed to the phenomenon. The literature has previously reported a number of patients with dual viral infections. Such cases are extremely rare. We believe that the eye is a relatively independent organ due to the presence of multiple barriers, resulting in viruses in the blood being relatively independent of viruses in the eye. Therefore, the situation of the viruses in the blood does not reflect the situation of the intraocular viruses, which is likely the reason for the different results of aqueous humour and blood virus tests. We have never been clear as to why three viruses were detected in the patient's aqueous humour. Indeed, we have not seen any similar reports in the past. Thus, we hypothesize that these three viruses coincidentally entered the eye successively within a short period of time while the patient was in an immunocompromised state, and at the same time the viruses escaped the surveillance of immune cells in the eye but could not enter the bloodstream due to the presence of multiple blood-eye barriers in the eye. Eventually, the three viruses simultaneously infected in the eye. Of course, although three viruses were detected in the patient's eye, this does not mean that all three viruses caused retinitis. In particular, whether EBV can cause retinitis in immunodeficient patients remains highly controversial. The vitreous cavity injection of ganciclovir treatment was effective essentially ruling out the possibility of EBV retinitis. Therefore, the final and most likely diagnosis for this patient remains CMV retinitis. However, the evidence of simultaneous intraocular infection by all three viruses is clear. As the concomitant detection of all three viruses in the same patient's eye is still quite rare, this case has certain research value.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^115uvDcV]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Medication history will also be informative. For example, anticoagulants are associated with subconjunctival hemorrhage, and topiramate is associated with angle-closure glaucoma. Patients requiring steroids may be at risk of more severe disease or other pathology, and referral to an eye care provider is recommended. The clinical examination should also include an assessment of the lymph nodes (swollen submandibular and preauricular lymph nodes). Lymphadenopathy, such as an enlarged, tender preauricular lymph node, is more common in viral versus bacterial conjunctivitis.

The physical eye examination should inspect for visual acuity, discharge type, corneal opacity, abnormal pupil size or shape, eyelid swelling, and orbit protrusion or asymmetry. Referral to an ophthalmologist or eye care professional should be performed immediately for cases that involve visual loss, moderate to severe pain, severe purulent discharge, or any corneal involvement. Useful information can be obtained with a simple penlight in the absence of a slit lamp, especially as it pertains to measurement of the anterior chamber depth and the ruling out of angle closure. Viral conjunctivitis can vary in presentation, but tearing, clear to white discharge, redness, and bilaterality are very common. Viral conjunctivitis usually starts with one eye, with the second eye to follow within a few days. Bacterial conjunctivitis is strongly suggested by glued eyelids, lack of itching, and lack of history of conjunctivitis. A diagnostic index for bacterial conjunctivitis by van Weert et al suggests that younger adult patients with conjunctivitis who present without glued eyelids at awakening are less likely to have conjunctivitis with a bacterial origin; this risk increases with age and presentation of two glued eyes.

A slit lamp provides a more detailed appearance of the conjunctival epithelium that enables differentiation between various types of conjunctival inflammation (follicular, mainly infectious; papillary, mainly allergic; pseudomembranous, severe EKC; eosinophilic, allergic). Fluorescein staining in conjunction with slit lamp examination, highlights patterns of corneal fluorescein uptake and exposes anterior chamber inflammation.HSV infection typically appears as branching lesions with intensely stained end bulbs, while highly branched lesions without end bulbs are typical of VZV infection.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for treatment of eye injuries and illnesses in the wilderness [^115mR5Zh]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society — conjunctivitis in wilderness settings is common, as "Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of a red eye", with "Common etiologies includ[ing] allergies, viruses, and bacteria". Bacterial conjunctivitis "gives a purulent discharge whereas viral conjunctivitis tends to give a watery discharge". Management differs by cause: "Treatment of allergic and viral conjunctivitis is primarily supportive, and bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with antibiotics", and "studies have demonstrated that use of antibiotics results in faster clinical and microbiological remission", with "no studies showing superiority of any one antibiotic" so choice is based on availability; "Erythromycin ointment, 1-cm ribbon, placed in the lower conjunctival sac 3 or 4 times daily for 7 days is a reasonable option". Because "viral conjunctivitis is extremely contagious", "proper hand washing is essential… to avoid spread throughout a group or to the contralateral eye". "Topical anesthetic eye drops are diagnostically beneficial and provide acute relief…; however,… they should not be used chronically as they are toxic to the corneal epithelium". Recommendation ratings: Topical or systemic antibiotics: 1A; Hand washing: 1C.

### Ocular manifestations of emerging viral diseases [^115sJ83Z]. Eye (2021). Medium credibility.

A common ocular finding in the initial phase is conjunctivitis, whilst scleral icterus is often a feature of the toxic phase. A small number of case reports suggest other ocular manifestations, with two intensive care patients reported in Brazil noted to present with bilateral increased choroidal thickness. One subsequently develops bilateral retinal vein congestion. The other developed bilateral mid-peripheral 360° detachment of the choroid and yellowish sub-retinal lesions. In another reported case, unilateral retinal oedema, macular exudates and haemorrhages were found during the convalescent stage, potentially due to immune-mediated causes.

There also exist case reports of ocular disorders associated with YFV vaccination, especially when the live YFV vaccine is combined with other vaccines, such as Neisseria Meningitidis, Hepatitis A/B or Typhoid. The reported complications are varied and include uveitis, unilateral optic neuropathy, evanescent white dot syndrome, multifocal choroiditis, arteriolar occlusion and even a Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada-like disease (with accompanying serous retinal detachment and choroidal thickening). These conditions are rarely reported and most often self-limiting with a favourable course over a few weeks with simple supportive anti-inflammatory treatment.

Diagnosis of YFV relies on PCR of blood or urine samples in the early stages, and ELISA or PRNT to detect antibodies in later stages. Treatment is mainly supportive, with a strong emphasis on prevention through public health measures and vaccination.

### Bleb-related endophthalmitis during an epidemic of viral keratoconjunctivitis [^117PHnwK]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

There is an annual epidemic of viral conjunctivitis at the onset of the monsoon (rainy) season in North India. This affects a large population, with many patients developing ocular symptoms and then getting better without any treatment as there is no specific therapy for adenoviral infections. However, this creates a dangerous situation for patients with operated trabeculectomy with a filtering bleb as conjunctivitis can lead to blebitis and bleb-related endophthalmitis with super-added bacterial/fungal infections. While the viral infection is self-limiting and most patients get well without treatment, urgent medical attention is required if patients with operated trabeculectomy develop this condition. It is important to educate all patients with operated glaucoma about the outbreak of conjunctivitis and explain the danger signs (like redness, sensitivity to light, vision decrease and pain, which require immediate medical attention and initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics if a delay is anticipated in visiting the hospital.

### Does this patient with acute infectious conjunctivitis have a bacterial infection? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^112ByJSW]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Acute infectious conjunctivitis is characterized by ocular redness and discharge, and is a common clinical entity. Evidence-based tools to aid the clinical diagnosis of viral vs bacterial conjunctivitis are lacking and may contribute to overprescribing of topical antibiotics.

Objective

To determine the relative prevalence of viral vs bacterial conjunctivitis in adults and children, and to determine which symptoms or signs are suggestive of a viral vs bacterial etiology.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (January 1946-March 2022) yielded 1891 articles. Included articles were rated using a quality score based on a modified Rational Clinical Examination grading system. Methodological quality levels 1 through 4 required a microbiological reference standard for diagnosis, whereas quality level 5 (the lowest quality) used a clinical reference standard for diagnosis.

Study Selection

Consecutive series of patients presenting with acute infectious conjunctivitis and case series of viral or bacterial conjunctivitis alone. Thirty-two studies were included in a meta-analysis to determine prevalence and diagnostic accuracy measures; 27 used a microbiological reference standard for diagnosis and 5 used a clinical reference standard for diagnosis.

Results

In studies involving children (5 studies; 881 patients; mean age, 4.7 years [age range, 1 month-18 years]), the prevalence of bacterial conjunctivitis was higher than viral conjunctivitis (71% vs 16%, respectively, P = 0.01). In the only study of adults (n = 207 patients; mean age, 25.7 years), the prevalence of viral conjunctivitis was higher than bacterial conjunctivitis (78% vs 16%, respectively, P < .001). For the primary analysis of level 1 (n = 6) and level 2 (n = 5) studies (1725 patients total), the clinical findings that best distinguished a viral etiology for conjunctivitis from a bacterial etiology included pharyngitis (sensitivity range, 0.55–0.58; specificity range, 0.89–0.94; positive likelihood ratio [LR] range, 5.4–9.9), preauricular lymphadenopathy (sensitivity range, 0.17–0.31; specificity range, 0.93–0.94; positive LR range, 2.5–5.6), and contact with another person with red eye (sensitivity, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.14–0.22]; specificity, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.90–0.95]; positive LR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.6–3.7]). Mucopurulent ocular discharge (sensitivity, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.60–0.87); specificity, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.58–0.73]; positive LR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.7–2.6]) and otitis media (sensitivity, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.20–0.29]; specificity, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.85–0.94]; positive LR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.5–4.4]) were associated with the presence of bacterial conjunctivitis.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this review, bacterial conjunctivitis was more common than viral conjunctivitis in children and viral conjunctivitis was more common than bacterial conjunctivitis in adults, although the prevalence estimates were based on limited evidence. Symptoms and signs associated with a higher likelihood of viral conjunctivitis in adults and children included concomitant pharyngitis, an enlarged preauricular node, and contact with another person with red eye, and signs associated with a higher likelihood of bacterial conjunctivitis included the presence of mucopurulent discharge and otitis media, but no single symptom or sign differentiated the 2 conditions with high certainty.

### Implications of COVID-19 for ophthalmologists [^111qjyLx]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To describe and explain the implications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for ophthalmologists considering the rapid developments in our understanding of the virology, transmission, and ocular involvement.

Design

Evidence-based perspective.

Methods

Review and synthesis of pertinent literature.

Results

Retrospective studies highlight that < 1% of patients display COVID-19-related conjunctivitis. However, prospective studies suggest the rate is higher (~6%). Viral RNA has been identified in tears and conjunctival secretions in patients with active conjunctivitis as well as asymptomatic cases. Overall, conjunctival swabs are positive in 2.5%. Samples taken earlier in the disease course are more likely to demonstrate positive virus. Viral transmission through ocular tissues has not been substantiated. Ophthalmologists are in the high-risk category for COVID-19 infection for several reasons: high-volume clinics, close proximity with patients, equipment-intense clinics, and direct contact with patients' conjunctival mucosal surfaces. COVID-19 is predominantly contracted through direct or airborne transmission by inhalation of respiratory droplets. Evidence that aerosol transmission occurs is increasing in particularly prolonged exposure to high concentrations in a relatively closed environment. Based on the current evidence, ophthalmologists should consider measures that include social distancing, wearing masks, sterilization techniques, and managing clinic volumes.

Conclusions

A major challenge to containing COVID-19 is that many infected people are asymptomatic. Droplet spread, contaminated environmental surfaces, and shared medical devices are areas that require management by ophthalmologists. More studies are required to explore the role of the conjunctiva and ocular tissues in the transmission of disease.

### Ligneous conjunctivitis secondary to viral conjunctivitis [^1137FeVu]. Cornea (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Ligneous conjunctivitis is a rare cause of chronic conjunctivitis that may be triggered by ocular insults such as trauma or infections. We present an interesting case of ligneous conjunctivitis caused by a viral infection that responded well to conservative management. Topical cyclosporine and heparin are a good treatment regimen that caused resolution of lesions and prevented recurrences.

### Ocular manifestations of emerging viral diseases [^1117PMLn]. Eye (2021). Medium credibility.

After contact with the virus, the asymptomatic incubation period ranges from 2 to 21 days with an average of 8 to 10 days. EVD is typically characterized by an initial fever, myalgias and fatigue, progressing to gastro-intestinal symptoms (diarrhoea and vomiting) and eventually a fatal multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. During acute infection, ocular manifestations include conjunctival injection (48–58%; often bilateral), subconjunctival haemorrhages and vision loss of unclear origin.

An important clinical sequel has surfaced in survivors, termed the 'post-Ebola virus disease syndrome'. This commonly manifests with ocular disease (60%), and may be accompanied by arthritis, hearing loss, abdominal pain and neuropsychiatric disorders as well as viral persistence in immune-privileged organs. Uveitis is the most common ocular complication, occurring in ~13–34% of EVD survivors in West Africa within the first 12 weeks (but sometimes even after a year) following convalescence. This commonly presents with eye pain, redness and photophobia and may lead to acute or chronic vision loss, with a unilateral predominance. Within uveitis, case series quote variable prevalence statistics, overall indicating anterior uveitis as most frequent, followed by posterior uveitis, and rarely panuveitis. Slit lamp examination often shows non-specific signs of active or past ocular inflammation e.g. posterior synechiae, keratic precipitates, anterior chamber cell and flare and conjunctival injection. Multimodal imaging including fundus photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be used to evaluate retinal lesions in posterior or panuveitis. A case series evaluating 14 EVD survivors noted retinal lesions that were predominantly non-pigmented with perilesional areas of dark without pressure, and peripapillary lesions that exhibited variable curvatures respecting the horizontal raphe and sparing the fovea. OCT showed abnormalities of the outer retinal layers (Fig. 1). In these uncontrolled cohorts, risk factors predicting uveitis include conjunctival injection, and a high viral load (corresponding to a low cycling threshold on reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analysis) during acute EVD, and advanced age. The PREVAIL III prospective cohort study in Liberia found that survivors exhibited more frequent uveitis than controls, and the prevalence increased during follow-up (at enrolment, 26.4% vs. 12.1%; at year 1, 33.3% vs. 15.4%). Neuro-ophthalmic complications are also possible, including optic neuropathy and ocular motility disorders. Other ophthalmic sequelae include episcleritis, interstitial keratitis and cataract.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112zRgJV]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) diagnostic testing in suspected end-organ disease — CMV viremia can be detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), antigen assays, or culture and is usually, but not invariably, present in end-organ disease, and viremia detected by these assays can be present in disease-free patients with low CD4 cell counts. Blood tests to detect CMV by antigen detection, culture, or PCR are not recommended for diagnosis of CMV end-organ disease because of their poor positive predictive value, and a negative serum or plasma PCR assay also does not rule out CMV end-organ disease. In CMV retinitis, CMV DNA can be detected in the vitreous in around 80% of cases but in only 70% in the blood, and CMV PCR can be particularly useful in assessing CSF or vitreous or aqueous humor specimens; a positive result is highly suggestive that CMV is the cause of end-organ disease, although PCR assays are not standardized and sensitivity, specificity, and interassay comparability are not clearly delineated. Presence of serum antibodies to CMV is not diagnostically useful, although a negative immunoglobulin G antibody level indicates that CMV is unlikely to be the cause of the disease process. CMV retinitis usually is diagnosed based on characteristic retinal changes seen through a dilated pupil during an ophthalmoscopic examination performed by an experienced ophthalmologist, and diagnosis in that setting has a 95% positive predictive value.

### Transmission of hepatitis C by blood splash into conjunctiva in a nurse [^117Lw8qG]. American Journal of Infection Control (2003). Low credibility.

The risk of transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is an important problem for the health care worker. HCV transmission by blood splashing into eyes is very rare. In a hemodialyses department, a 23-year-old female nurse splashed blood from a patient who was anti-HCV positive into her eyes. She washed her eyes with water immediately and reported to the infection control department. She had never used intravenous drugs nor received transfusions. At the time of exposure, there was no abnormality in her laboratory tests. Her anti-HCV and HCV-RNA tests produced negative results. She was followed up for anti-HCV and alanine aminotransferase activity. After 6 months, she presented with sore throat, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weight loss. She had icterus and hepatomegalia. In laboratory tests, alanine aminotransferase level was 504 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase level was 388 U/L, and anti-HCV and HCV-RNA tests produced positive findings. She was treated with interferon alfa-2a for a 1-year period. After treatment, an HCV-RNA test produced negative results and transaminase levels were normal. In conclusion, splashing blood from patients who are HCV positive into the face or eyes is a risk for health care workers. They should be educated to prevent a nosocomial acquisition of bloodborne infection and they should observe protective precautions.

### Neonatal herpes simplex virus infections [^1139tzwc]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Neonatal herpes simplex virus infections can result in serious morbidity and mortality. Many of the infections result from asymptomatic cervical shedding of virus after a primary episode of genital HSV in the third trimester. Antibodies to HSV-2 have been detected in approximately 20 percent of pregnant women, but only 5 percent report a history of symptomatic infection. All primary episodes of HSV and secondary episodes near term or at the time of delivery should be treated with antiviral therapy. If active HSV infection is present at the time of delivery, cesarean section should be performed. Symptomatic and asymptomatic primary genital HSV infections are associated with preterm labor and low-birth-weight infants. The diagnosis of neonatal HSV can be difficult, but it should be suspected in any newborn with irritability, lethargy, fever or poor feeding at one week of age. Diagnosis is made by culturing the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine and fluid from eyes, nose and mucous membranes. All newborns suspected to have or who are diagnosed with HSV infection should be treated with parenteral acyclovir.

### Virtual consultation for red eye [^113X36wt]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Virtual examination

After a detailed history (box 2), a subsequent video consultation is desirable but may not always be necessary, for example, if a diagnosis can be made confidently (such as conjunctivitis) or if the patient warrants a face-to-face ophthalmic examination (such as corneal infection with severe painful red eye and visual loss).

Box 2
Pointers for history taking in a patient with red eye(s)

Is it painful? Red eye with no pain or only mild discomfort is usually self limiting (fig 1). Painful red eye usually points towards more serious causes such as corneal infection, anterior uveitis, acute angle-closure glaucoma, or scleritis. In the presence of ocular pain, explore the onset, duration, progression, laterality, and severity of the pain. Ask about red flag symptoms that indicate serious conditions (box 1). Photophobia is suggestive of corneal pathologies or anterior uveitis. Pain on eye movements suggests orbital pathology.
Is it unilateral or bilateral? Acute painful red eye conditions — including corneal infection, acute angle-closure glaucoma, and scleritis — often present unilaterally. These are potentially sight threatening. Anterior uveitis may present unilaterally or bilaterally. Unilateral conjunctivitis should be a diagnosis of exclusion, after ruling out any red flag symptoms and signs.
Is there any discharge? Ocular discharge and itching are commonly associated with conjunctivitis. Viral conjunctivitis usually produces watery mucous discharge, whereas bacterial conjunctivitis produces mucopurulent discharge with crusting of the eyelashes.
Is the vision affected? Loss of vision in red eye suggests a more serious cause, particularly when the loss of vision is sudden, severe, or progressive. Reduced visual acuity with painful red eye, halos, and headache are indicative of acute angle-closure glaucoma. Serious red eye conditions such as anterior uveitis and anterior scleritis may not present with visual loss during the initial stage. New onset of double vision with red eye is suggestive of orbital pathologies, including orbital cellulitis and thyroid eye disease.
Any contact lens wear? A painful red eye in contact lens wearers should raise the suspicion of contact lens-related corneal infection. This requires an urgent ophthalmic assessment within 24 hours.

### Transmission of west nile virus through blood transfusion in the United States in 2002 [^114sYJgt]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

During the 2002 West Nile virus epidemic in the United States, patients were identified whose West Nile virus illness was temporally associated with the receipt of transfused blood and blood components.

Methods

Patients with laboratory evidence of recent West Nile virus infection within four weeks after receipt of a blood component from a donor with viremia were considered to have a confirmed transfusion-related infection. We interviewed the donors of these components, asking them whether they had had symptoms compatible with the presence of a viral illness before or after their donation; blood specimens retained from the time of donation and collected at follow-up were tested for West Nile virus.

Results

Twenty-three patients were confirmed to have acquired West Nile virus through transfused leukoreduced and nonleukoreduced red cells, platelets, or fresh-frozen plasma. Of the 23 recipients, 10 (43 percent) were immunocompromised owing to transplantation or cancer and 8 (35 percent) were at least 70 years of age. Immunocompromised recipients tended to have longer incubation periods than nonimmunocompromised recipients and infected persons in mosquito-borne community outbreaks. Sixteen donors with evidence of viremia at donation were linked to the 23 infected recipients; of these donors, 9 reported viral symptoms before or after donation, 5 were asymptomatic, and 2 were lost to follow-up. Fever, new rash, and painful eyes were independently associated with being an implicated donor with viremia rather than a donor without viremia. All 16 donors were negative for West Nile virus-specific IgM antibody at donation.

Conclusions

Transfused red cells, platelets, and fresh-frozen plasma can transmit West Nile virus. Screening of potential donors with the use of nucleic acid-based assays for West Nile virus may reduce this risk.

### Pathogenicity and transmissibility of bovine H5N1 influenza virus [^111VUe85]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

We next intranasally infected female ferrets with 10⁶ PFU of Cow-H5N1 or VN1203-H5N1 (four animals per virus) and examined tissue tropism at days 3 and 6 postinfection. Ferrets infected with either virus showed elevated body temperatures and body weight loss after infection (Extended Data Fig. 3), consistent with clinical disease. As in mice, both viruses replicated to high titres in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and spread to non-respiratory organs (including eyes, brain, colon, liver, spleen, kidney and/or heart) in some of the infected ferrets (Fig. 3). Virus was also detected in the mammary glands and teats but only in a few animals in each group. No virus was detected in the blood or muscle tissues of ferrets infected with Cow-H5N1, VN1203-H5N1 or Isumi-H1N1 in a separate experiment (Extended Data Fig. 4). At present, it is unclear whether the lack of virus in the blood and muscle tissues of ferrets is due to differences in the animals or due to the inability of HPAI H5N1 viruses to spread to blood and/or muscle tissues in the ferret model. Nonetheless, these findings are consistent with other reports of the systemic spread of related HPAI H5N1 viruses in ferrets, including limited spread to the ocular tissues; and further support the possibility that mammary gland and/or teat tropism are features of mammalian infection with HPAI H5N1 viruses, and not a specific characteristic of HPAI H5N1 isolated from lactating dairy cattle.

### Systemic and localized infections in humans caused by paenibacillus: a case report and literature review [^1154CtNH]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patient examination and preliminary diagnosis

Due to the patient's recurrent episodes of eye redness and the extended time elapsed since hospital admission, we conducted immune-related blood tests and intraocular fluid tests. The results of the immune-related blood tests were as follows:

Routine blood and electrolyte tests did not reveal any significant abnormalities.
In the liver function tests, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were elevated at 105 U/L (normal range: 0–40 U/L), glutamine aminotransferase (AST) levels were elevated at 70 U/L (normal range: 0–40 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase isoenzyme levels were elevated at 25 U/L (normal range: 0–15 U/L), and glutamine transpeptidase was elevated at 63 U/L (normal range: 0–58 U/L).
Renal function tests did not display any noticeable irregularities.
Tuberculosis infection-related tests (including Mycobacterium tuberculosis T cells and tuberculosis antibodies) yielded negative results.
Autoimmune-related antibodies were also negative.
Viral tests indicated the presence of antibodies IgG to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), IgG to the measles virus, and IgG to cytomegalovirus. The remaining viral tests were negative.
Blood culture results were negative for both bacterial and fungal infections.

Following the negative results from the systemic examination, the possibility of a localized ocular infection was considered. To confirm this suspicion, metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) was conducted on the intraocular fluid. The mNGS analysis confirmed the presence of a P. lautus infection. Further, bacterial and fungal smears and cultures were performed on the intraocular fluid, and these tests yielded negative results, indicating the absence of other bacterial or fungal infections within the eye.

### A case of acute idiopathic maculopathy in both eyes with peripheral vascular occlusion [^113DNnRV]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

The etiology of AIM remains unclear, but more and more reports connect it to viral infections including coxsackievirus and yellow fever virus. COVID-19 vaccine, Zika vaccine, as well as the N1H1 vaccine reported recently also seem to be linked to the onset of AIM. This specific history indicates that the development of AIM could be closely related to active immunization triggered by viral infection. The majority of specialists think that AIM is an acute inflammatory process that affects the choroidal capillaries and/or the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which then breaks the external blood-retinal barrier (BRB). In a few cases, OCTA revealed an absence of choroidal blood flow signal. This is consistent with the findings of Hashimoto who concluded that AIM is an inflammatory disease of the choroid, resulting in a decrease in choroidal blood flow velocity with thinning of choroidal thickness. There are also a few reports in the literature indicating that choroidal capillaritis and choroidal inflammatory cell accumulation are secondary to a viral etiology subsequently affecting the RPE and outer retina. It is hypothesized that viral infection releases large amounts of proinflammatory factors whose procoagulant effects lead to the development of intravascular coagulation and endothelial damage. In addition, a direct viral infection or an autoimmune reaction linked to a viral infection may also be the cause of the deterioration of this choroidal circulation.

### Diagnosis and management of the acute red eye [^111cZfao]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The red eye is one of the most frequent presenting complaints in the emergency department setting. A wide spectrum of disease processes may present as a red eye, ranging from benign self-limiting etiologies to serious vision-threatening ones. The emergency physician must be adept at recognizing "red flags" from the history and physical examination that necessitate immediate treatment and referral. In addition, it is imperative for the emergency physician to recognize the need for immediate versus elective ophthalmologist consultation for the various conditions. This article includes a discussion of the key historical features, clinical presentations, physical examination findings, and management of the more common causes of the red eye.

### Dengue vaccine: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices, United States, 2021 [^115hEkMw]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Dengue Clinical Disease

Dengue clinical disease ranges from a mild, undifferentiated febrile illness to severe disease complicated by shock, bleeding, or severe organ impairment. Approximately 75% of dengue infections are mild or asymptomatic. The most common presentation of symptomatic disease is sudden onset of fever accompanied by headache, retro-orbital pain, generalized myalgia and arthralgia, flushing of the face, anorexia, abdominal pain, and nausea. A generalized erythematous, macular rash developing within 3–4 days of fever onset frequently is observed. Laboratory-detected findings can include leukopenia, hemoconcentration, transaminitis, and thrombocytopenia. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies dengue illness as 1) dengue with or without warning signs for progression toward severe dengue and 2) severe dengue. Warning signs of severe dengue include abdominal pain or tenderness, persistent vomiting, clinical fluid accumulation (e.g. ascites, pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion), mucosal bleeding, lethargy or restlessness, postural hypotension, liver enlargement of > 2 cm, or an increased hematocrit level concurrent with a rapid decrease in platelet count. Criteria for the case definition of severe dengue include any sign of severe plasma leakage leading to shock or fluid accumulation with respiratory distress, severe bleeding, or severe organ impairment.

Patients with severe dengue need in-hospital medical treatment to mitigate poor clinical outcomes commonly due to vascular permeability, which results in plasma leakage and leads to hypovolemic shock or clinically significant ascites or pleural effusions, and less commonly, to severe bleeding due to various host or viral factors. Because of the risk for complications due to plasma leakage and bleeding, severe dengue requires monitoring and treatment in intensive care settings. Although rare, dengue can affect the liver, heart, central nervous system, kidneys, eyes, muscles, or bone marrow. These severe manifestations of dengue carry a high risk for death and must be recognized and appropriately managed in a timely manner. Age, comorbidities, host genetics, and the infecting virus strain are risk factors for severe dengue, and heterotypic secondary infections are the most prominent factor associated with severe dengue.

Dengue Treatment

No effective antiviral treatments against dengue are available; therefore, the mainstay for preventing severe disease and death is timely and supportive management with volume replacement, particularly among patients with severe dengue. The case-fatality ratio for severe dengue has been reported to be as high as 13% and can be < 1% with access to timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^115hCaj7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Table 5 — Patient information sheet on diagnosis of acute sinusitis — defines key diagnostic features and distinguishes viral from bacterial illness for adults. Sinusitis, also called rhinosinusitis, affects about 1 in 8 adults annually. Acute sinusitis is present with up to 4 weeks of cloudy or colored nasal drainage plus one or both of the following: a stuffy, congested, or blocked nose, and pain, pressure or fullness in the face, head, or around the eyes. Acute viral sinusitis is likely if illness has been present less than 10 days without worsening, whereas acute bacterial sinusitis is likely when there is no improvement within 10 days of getting sick or when symptoms worsen within 10 days after beginning to get better. Because treatment differs by cause, acute viral sinusitis does not benefit from antibiotics, but some patients with acute bacterial sinusitis may get better faster with an antibiotic.

### Ocular manifestations of emerging viral diseases [^113kNay1]. Eye (2021). Medium credibility.

Human-to-human

Ebola* (Filoviridae)

Ebola virus (EBOV) is an enveloped, filamentous, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus of the Filoviridae family. EBOV is the cause of the frequently lethal Ebola virus disease (EVD), which has a documented case fatality rate of around 50%. EVD outbreaks typically start from a single case of probable zoonotic transmission, and fruit bats, likely of the Pteropodidae family, are believed to be the natural reservoir for the virus. Human-to-human transmission then occurs via direct contact, or contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated fomites. The unprecedented 2013–2016 Western African EVD outbreak (the largest in history: 28,600 cases and 11,300 deaths) and the ongoing EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have shed light on the spectrum of manifestations of EVD.

### Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection following occupational ocular exposure [^111GSnd4]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

This symptomatic case of an LCMV infection followed an accidental occupational ocular exposure to a small amount (approximately 50 µL) of a solution containing a high concentration of LCMV (estimated dose received of 5×10⁵ PFU). Previous case reports of occupational contamination of LCMV have primarily described percutaneous transmission or inhalation of biological fluids. Several decades ago, a laboratory worker infected herself following a conjunctival injury caused by glass powder contaminated with LCMV. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first documented case of seroconversion for LCMV following ocular exposure through a mucosal contact.

Since 2015, other cases of accidental LCMV exposure involving research laboratory workers have been reported to our occupational health service. These cases included a bite from a previously infected mouse which had already partly eliminated the virus as well as three needle prick injuries; the first from a needle soiled with blood from a previously infected mouse, the second from an empty needle immediately after administration of the LCMV containing solution to a mouse and the third from a needle coupled to a syringe containing a concentrated solution of LCMV. Of these four cases, all except the latter remained asymptomatic with no seroconversion during the follow-up period. In asymptomatic cases, we presume that the inoculum was significantly lower compared with a direct contact with a solution of LCMV, as seen in needle stick injuries or ocular splashes.

While laboratory safety protocols and first aid measures are clearly defined, precise monitoring guidelines after occupational exposure to LCMV are currently lacking. Prophylactic vaccines, postexposure prophylaxis and specific treatments for LCMV are not yet available. Treatment primarily focuses on symptomatic relief and the efficacy of ribavirin in improving outcomes for patients with LCMV infection remains unclear. Our occupational health service has established a standardised procedure for managing occupational injuries involving LCMV exposure, which includes clinical evaluation and serological monitoring. Additional LCMV RT-PCR testing is warranted if symptoms develop. Typically, LCMV RT-PCR performed during the acute phase of symptoms is a sensitive and appropriate diagnostic tool for detecting an LCMV infection, but the kinetics and magnitude of serum viraemia in human infection are unknown. However, in the case we present here, the diagnosis was not initially confirmed. The patient developed aspecific influenza-like symptoms and the RT-PCR test on blood plasma showed a negative result at that time. The negative finding could result in a viral load below the detection threshold of this RT-PCR assay. Furthermore, the fact that the patient did not develop a secondary phase of symptoms, such as meningitis, supports the observation that LCMV infection is generally asymptomatic or mild, self-limited illness.

### An updated review of feline coronavirus: mind the two biotypes [^111ezquC]. Virus Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The pathogenesis of effusive and noneffusive FIP is of great interest to researchers. It has been reported that the occurrence of effusive or noneffusive form depends on immune status. Studies have shown that FIPV infections caused by both inoculation in the laboratory and natural infection have very short effusive FIP periods. Observations of experimentally and naturally infected cats have shown that lesions associated with noneffusive FIP are remnants of lesions associated with effusive FIP, which indicates that during the initial stage of FIPV infection, a short episode of effusive FIP might develop first because of the weak immune response to the virus, while with the improvement of the immune response, effusive FIP should gradually transform to noneffusive FIP. When the immune system is suppressed, noneffusive FIP can transform into effusive FIP. In the final stage of the disease, the occurrence of noneffusive FIP is presumably due to partial protection by the immune system. Whether effusive or noneffusive FIP occurs may be related to whether the body initiates a cellular or humoral immune response in the early stage of infection. Clinical disease symptoms do not occur if cellular immunity is activated early and if the immune response is sufficient, although viral replication can still be detected. At this time, the infection often progresses to noneffusive FIP. If a humoral immune response occurs and cellular immune initiation fails, the final form of the disease is often effusive or wet FIP. Nevertheless, in many cases, the host mounts an immune response in the middle stage of infection, initiating strong humoral immunity and weak cellular immunity. At this time, both virus replication and virus eradication occur. As a result, noneffusive FIP develops, and typical granulomas form. In the centers of the granulomas are small aggregations of macrophages that generally do not contain virus antigens or contain only small amounts of virus antigens surrounded by a broad band of lymphocytes or plasma cells. Effusive FIP can lead to the formation of pyogranulomas covered with virus-loaded macrophages and scattered neutrophils and lymphocytes. Pyogranulomas extend from the surface of an organ into the underlying parenchyma. The distribution of dry FIP granulomas in organs is related to a partial or weak immune status. At the initial stage of FIPV invasion, the virus reaches the brain and eyes through infected monocytes. However, because of the blood‒brain barrier, immune cells have difficulty reaching the brain. If protective immunity is strong enough, virus particles or virus-infected cells are quickly eradicated; if immunity is weak, immune cells are much more effective in dealing with virus particles and virus-infected cells in the core of the body than they will be in the brain or eyes due to the blood‒brain barrier. Thus, lesions in the brain and eyes last longer than those in the abdomen or other parts of the body, which explains why dry FIP is more likely than wet FIP to occur in the brain and eyes (Fig. 3).

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116JEcsw]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis — antiviral resistance and laboratory assessment: Drug resistance occurs with long-term anti-CMV therapy, with rates of approximately 25% per person-year in the pre-ART era and lower (approximately 5% per person-year) in the ART era. Low-level resistance to ganciclovir occurs through mutations in the CMV UL97 gene, high-level resistance to ganciclovir typically occurs because of mutations in both the CMV UL97 and UL54 genes, and resistance to foscarnet or cidofovir occurs because of mutations in the CMV UL54 gene; high-level resistance to ganciclovir often is associated with cross resistance to cidofovir and occasionally to foscarnet. Because resistant CMV most often involves CMV UL97 mutations and few mutations account for most drug resistance, susceptibility testing in peripheral blood using a CMV DNA PCR assay and sequencing for CMV UL97 mutations or a point mutation assay may be reasonable for patients who relapse on therapy; the virus in the eye and in the blood are identical in more than 90% of cases. Sequencing the UL97 gene from PCR-amplified blood specimens can be accomplished in less than 48 hours and correlates well with conventional drug susceptibility testing and clinical outcomes; by themselves, peripheral blood CMV viral load measurements have poor positive predictive value for treatment failure. UL97 mutants usually respond to foscarnet, as do some UL54 mutants; patients with high-level ganciclovir-resistant isolates will require a switch to alternative therapy, and many clinicians will treat with a series of intravitreal injections of foscarnet and/or systemic foscarnet (CIII).

### Reyataz [^111hZs1b]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

-

If you take too much REYATAZ, call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away.

When your supply of REYATAZ starts to run low, get more from your healthcare provider or pharmacy. It is important not to run out of REYATAZ. The amount of HIV-1 in your blood may increase if the medicine is stopped for even a short time. The virus may become resistant to REYATAZ and harder to treat.

What are the possible side effects of REYATAZ?

REYATAZ can cause serious side effects, including:

-

A change in the way your heart beats (heart rhythm change). Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get dizzy or lightheaded. These could be symptoms of a heart problem.

-

Skin rash. Skin rash is common with REYATAZ but can sometimes be severe. Skin rash usually goes away within 2 weeks without any change in treatment. Severe rash may develop in association with other symptoms which could be serious. If you develop a severe rash or a rash with any of the following symptoms, stop taking REYATAZ and call your healthcare provider right away:

o

general feeling of discomfort or "flu-like" symptoms

o

fever

o

muscle or joint aches

o

red or inflamed eyes, like "pink eye" (conjunctivitis)

o

blisters

o

mouth sores

o

swelling of your face

o

painful, warm, or red lump under your skin

-

Yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes is common with REYATAZ, and is usually not harmful in adults and infants older than 3 months of age; but it could also be a symptom of a serious problem. These effects may be due to increases in bilirubin levels in your blood (bilirubin is made by the liver). Although these effects may not be damaging to your liver, skin, or eyes, tell your healthcare provider right away if your skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow.

Diagnosis relies upon dengue symptomatology, and confirmation by laboratory testing. In the first 5 days, real-time RT-PCR or NS1 antigen detection allow confirmation. More commonly confirmation occurs after 5 days, with ELISA-based detection of anti-Dengue IgM or seroconversion in paired acute and convalescent serum samples. Workup of posterior segment pathology to identify and grade severity of complications as well as facilitate mechanistic understanding involves visual field testing and multimodal imaging. The latter includes fundoscopy, fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography, OCT for subclassification, and more recently OCT angiography. Ocular manifestations resolve spontaneously in the majority of cases and evidence for topical or systemic treatment with corticosteroids lacks consensus. Vaccines in the latter development stages are showing some promise.

Zika* (Flaviviridae)

Zika virus (ZIKV) is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded, RNA virus with an icosahedral capsid, and is a member of the Flaviviridae family. First discovered in Uganda, ZIKV has since disseminated widely throughout Africa, Asia, Pacific islands, South and Central America, causing notable outbreaks in Micronesia (2007), French Polynesia (2013) and the Americas (2015–16).

Zika is principally transmitted via the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito (such as A. aegypti and A. albopticus), usually during daytime. Human-to-human transmission can then occur via sexual contact, blood transfusions, organ donation and vertically from mother to foetus. Findings of viral RNA in tears and conjunctival swabs from confirmed human cases highlight a potential ophthalmic route of transmission.

### Sore eyes as the most significant ocular symptom experienced by people with COVID-19: a comparison between pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 States [^115YAgMW]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Early in the pandemic, ocular transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was not thought to be a possibility. However, a study investigating a previous coronavirus outbreak (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) suggests that people who wore full protective wear, including eye protection, showed no evidence of serum antibodies. In contrast, people who wore full personal protective equipment but no eye protection were infected with SARS-CoV-2.

It would be important to ascertain which ocular conjunctival symptoms are reported most frequently. Conjunctivitis manifests with different aetiologies and ocular symptoms, including mucopurulent discharge and itchy eyes associated with bacterial and viral conjunctivitis, respectively. In addition, it would be useful to know how these ocular manifestations compare with other known COVID-19-like symptoms (such as fever and dry cough), how long they last for and when do they manifest when compared with the other COVID-19 symptoms. In addition, as a number of people are known to suffer from other chronic ocular symptoms, it would be useful to compare ocular symptoms before and during COVID-19 state. The aims of the study were to examine the above points.

### Hepatitis C virus infection is not associated with a marked increase in the prevalence of ophthalmic morbidity [^115cMs5Z]. Eye (2000). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus has been reported to cause a wide variety of ophthalmic lesions. The incidence and significance of these lesions in an unselected population has not been assessed.

Methods

We studied a group of unselected patients with chronic hepatitis C and performed a full ophthalmic examination on each. As a control group we studied patients with chronic hepatitis B infection.

Results

In 25 patients with chronic hepatitis C we found no increase in the prevalence of significant ocular disease when compared with a cohort of patients with chronic hepatitis B.

Conclusion

Chronic heptatitis C does not cause any marked increase in the incidence of ocular disease.

### Ocular manifestations of emerging viral diseases [^111Rz8d6]. Eye (2021). Medium credibility.

Arboviruses

Dengue (Flaviviridae)

Dengue viruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded, RNA viruses of the Flaviviridae family. They are the cause of dengue fever. There are four viral serotypes 1–4 with no cross-immunity, and spread is via Aedes mosquito vectors. Incidence has increased 30-fold over recent decades, and there are now an estimated 96 million symptomatic infections annually, two million cases of severe dengue, and 21,000 deaths. Occurring in endemic–epidemic cycles in crowded tropical urban areas, the largest numbers of infections are in children in Asia and young adults in the American tropics, albeit with significant extension to other continents.

Dengue fever occurs 3–14 days after a mosquito bite, with development of a non-specific febrile phase lasting 3–6 days. Upon fever resolution, some cases progress to a critical phase of plasma leakage into abdominal and pleural cavities, also sometimes associated with impaired haemostasis. Other findings include vomiting, petechial rash, myalgia, hepatomegaly, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. A convalescent phase follows. Cases of severe dengue involve dengue shock syndrome and respiratory distress secondary to plasma leakage, severe bleeding and severe end organ involvement.

### What we know about ocular manifestations of Ebola [^111kpyNF]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Ebola hemorrhagic fever is a deadly disease caused by several species of ebolavirus. The current outbreak of 2014 is unique in that it has affected a greater number of people than ever before. It also has an unusual geographic distribution. Nonspecific findings such as fever and generalized weakness have traditionally been very common early in the acute phase. Ophthalmic manifestations have also been reported in significant numbers. Conjunctival injection has been identified in both the acute and late phases. Subconjunctival hemorrhage and excessive lacrimation have also been reported. Various forms of uveitis have been associated with the convalescent phase of the disease. When identified in conjunction with other signs such as fever, acute findings such as conjunctivitis may contribute to the diagnosis of Ebola hemorrhagic fever. Ideally, serologic testing should be performed prior to isolation and treatment of these individuals. Considering the prevalence of the current outbreak and the threat of transcontinental spread, ophthalmic health professionals need to be aware of the ocular manifestations of Ebola hemorrhagic fever as well as the associated signs and symptoms in order to prevent further spread.

### The role of the ocular tissue in SARS-CoV-2 transmission [^111Jyz2p]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and Future Studies

The development of effective therapies and vaccines against the COVID-19 pandemic is still rapidly evolving. Therefore, understanding the possible transmission routes and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection is of utmost importance. Current studies suggested that the eye is a potential route for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and infection. However, the risk of viral spreading via ocular secretions and tears or contracting an infection via the eye is likely low comparing to other routes of infection such as respiratory tissues. This is supported by both clinical studies and research findings including low rates of viral RNA detected in conjunctival swabs and epidemiologic studies showing a relatively low likelihood of developing ocular manifestations or infection. Fortunately, there is no evidence showing that SARS-CoV-2 affects visual acuity or other visual functions. However, appropriate precautions and use of personal protective equipment for the eyes such as goggles and face shields should still be employed at this time. Until more conclusive results are available, preventative measures should reflect the most up to date evidence. We believe that future studies are needed to determine:
The potential for viral shedding in tears or secretions of asymptomatic carriers since they play an important role in the pandemic. It has already been shown that COVID-19 patients without any ocular manifestations shed detectable levels of virus but the study of asymptomatic carriers is not yet available.
A standardized method for collecting ocular samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Heterogeneity in testing techniques are an unnecessary impact on clinical and research outcomes. A standardized approach for sample collection as well as a wider range of sampling time points would provide insightful information.
Whether ocular surface tissues can be directly infected by SARS-CoV-2 using in vivo models, ideally primate models. Animal models would provide pertinent information, such as minimum viral titer and the duration from infection to the onset of ocular symptoms/signs.
The risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure during ocular surgeries. Napoli et al summarized potential risks and potential solutions to minimize viral exposure for eye surgeons. The authors emphasized the possibility of generating bioaerosols during lacrimal procedures. More research is needed to determine these risk factors and find out effective strategies to protect practitioners. In addition, there have been no studies to determine if the aqueous humor could contain SARS-CoV-2. Different from tears, aqueous humor is not secreted in normal individuals. However, for glaucoma patients who have received trabeculectomy, drainage valves, and similar procedures, their aqueous humor may be a potential source of viral transmission.
The association between uveitis and SARS-CoV-2. A recent study showed that IFN induces ACE2 in human airway epithelium. Since IFN is used to treat certain uveitis, it may also increase the chance of viral contraction and/or spreading among these patients.

### Bloodborne pathogen exposure risk among surgeons in sub-saharan Africa [^114YKbCr]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2007). Low credibility.

To document the frequency and circumstances of bloodborne pathogen exposures among surgeons in sub-Saharan Africa, we surveyed surgeons attending the 2006 Pan-African Association of Surgeons conference. During the previous year, surgeons sustained a mean of 3.1 percutaneous injuries, which were typically caused by suture needles. They sustained a mean of 4.1 exposures to blood and body fluid, predominantly from blood splashes to the eyes. Fewer than half of the respondents reported completion of hepatitis B vaccination, and postexposure prophylaxis for human immunodeficiency virus was widely available. Surgeons reported using hands-free passing and blunt suture needles. Non-fluid-resistant cotton gowns and masks were the barrier garments worn most frequently.

### Clinical characteristics and aetiology of uveitis in a viral haemorrhagic fever zone [^113THLqV]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

The primary findings of this project underscore the continued prevalence of uveitis as a significant cause of visual impairment, particularly in the form of advanced disease as posterior uveitis, panuveitis and bilateral disease. Given the large number of uveitis sufferers in the country and the low number of ophthalmic trained staff available to manage them with limited resources, this condition represents a significant public health concern. Trauma is an important risk factor for uveitis and contributed to a significant proportion of disease. The study highlights substantial advancements in the development and application of laboratory investigations for uveitis diagnosis, yet further efforts are required to enhance the differentiation of its underlying causes. Specifically, it is recommended that additional laboratory studies would aid in identifying the aetiology. Obtaining anterior chamber and vitreous samples for processing would be beneficial in obtaining more definitive diagnoses for infectious aetiologies.

### Characteristics of ocular findings of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in hubei province, China [^112rVSRx]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the ocular manifestations and conjunctival viral prevalence in patients from Hubei province, China, with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?

Findings

In this case series including 38 patients with COVID-19, 12 patients had ocular manifestations, such as epiphora, conjunctival congestion, or chemosis, and these commonly occurred in patients with more severe systemic manifestations. Reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction results were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in 28 nasopharyngeal swabs and 2 conjunctival swabs, and more significant changes in blood test values appeared in patients with ocular abnormalities.

Meaning

These data may assist ophthalmologists and others to understand the ocular manifestations of COVID-19, thus enhancing the diagnosis and prevention of the transmission of the disease.

### Long-term ocular damage after recovery from COVID-19: lack of evidence at three months [^116YHezp]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prior to 2019, coronaviruses, first discovered in 1968, caused two epidemic outbreaks: In Hong Kong in 2003, in the form of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, in form of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Since its first detection in Wuhan in December 2019, a novel strain entitled SARS-CoV-2 has erupted into a long-lasting global pandemic, that was declared as such by the WHO in March 2020. The virus poses a deadly threat to the elderly, as well as those who have pre-existing conditions. In younger patients, mild and even asymptomatic courses are frequent. As of January 2021, COVID-19 nears a 100 million cases worldwide.

At about the same time, the first outbreak occurred in Italy, which drew the attention of the scientific community to the political, health and therapeutic management of this crisis. Thanks to the experience of the health care workers (HCW) and the constant exchange in the scientific community, any knowledge about patient management, triaging and current therapy recommendations was quickly and adequately accessible and under constant validation. An important finding was that the HCW infection rate was 12% by July 2020, showing how highly contagious and how extremely important protective measures are in dealing with COVID-19 patients.

### Virtual consultation for red eye [^115FXmnz]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

What you should do

Recognising when to refer patients with a red eye to ophthalmology services, whether it is routine or urgently, is crucial (box 4). Figure 1 represents possible diagnoses to consider based on initial assessment.

Box 4
Conditions that require urgent referral to an ophthalmologist

Severe "conjunctivitis" that does not improve after several days of antibiotic treatment ("bacterial conjunctivitis") or lubricants ("viral conjunctivitis")
Corneal infection (especially in contact lens wearers)
Anterior uveitis
Acute angle-closure glaucoma
Endophthalmitis (suspect if the patient had intra-ocular surgery within the past week)
Ocular trauma (including mechanical, chemical, and thermal injury)
Scleritis
Orbital cellulitis

Patients with non-sight threatening red eye conditions — such as mild infectious or non-infectious conjunctivitis, subconjunctival haemorrhage, or mild corneal abrasion — can be reassured and managed in the community. Advise that most cases of acute viral and bacterial conjunctivitis will resolve without any treatment in 5–7 days. A trial of topical antibiotics (such as chloramphenicol or fusidic acid) can be started if symptoms are not resolving within three days of onset in bacterial conjunctivitis. If the condition does not improve or if it worsens after treatment, offer referral to an eye casualty unit for urgent ophthalmic assessment.

Suspected severe and potentially sight threatening conditions (box 4) or the presence of red flags (see box 1) warrant prompt ophthalmology referral. Patients with recurrent history of red eye related conditions warrant a face-to-face ophthalmology review. Ocular signs could be too subtle to be picked up by mobile imaging. Contact the local on-call ophthalmology team immediately for these patients.

Education into practice

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^11755Euo]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conjunctivitis (pink eye)

Background

Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the inside surface lining of the eyelids and covering of the eyeball. The eye may appear red and may have a clear or cloudy discharge. Conjunctivitis has both noninfectious and infectious causes that can be bacterial or viral. Conjunctivitis does not necessarily require treatment with topical or oral antibiotics.

Many large, community-based outbreaks of conjunctivitis, including outbreaks among school children, on college campuses, and in military facilities have been documented. – In neonates, conjunctivitis can be associated with serious invasive disease that involves multiple organs. Careful hand hygiene can reduce transmission.

Individuals who have conjunctivitis should be considered contagious until their symptoms have resolved. The viruses and bacteria that most commonly cause conjunctivitis are transmitted to eyes from hands that are contaminated with the infectious eye drainage, from contaminated objects (shared towels and washcloths, eye drop solution, or contact lens solution), or potentially by direct inoculation into the eye via large respiratory droplets from an ill individual who is coughing.

Recommendations

Restrict individuals with severe conjunctivitis (i.e. copious eye discharge, eye irritation causing frequent eye rubbing or itching, or conjunctivitis accompanied by fever or respiratory symptoms) from entering the family-centered residential facility.
Allow individuals with mild conjunctivitis ("pink eye" with no active discharge, minimum eye irritation, and no fever) to enter the facility, but require such guests to stay in their personal room until their symptoms have resolved.
Allow individuals who were exposed to a person with conjunctivitis but who do not have symptoms of illness to enter the facility. No special precautions are required.
Educate guests and visitors about the importance of frequent hand hygiene, avoidance of sharing personal items (e.g. towels and washcloths, eye drops, and contact lens solutions), and prompt removal and careful handling of contaminated items (e.g. tissues, towels, and linens).

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^113eJ6MH]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Conjunctivitis is a collective term for a diverse group of diseases that are characterized by inflammation of the conjunctiva. The most common cause of infectious conjunctivitis is viral infection (~80% of cases), followed by bacterial. The noninfectious forms are allergic, mechanical/irritative/toxic, immune-mediated, and neoplastic. Of noninfectious conjunctivitis, the allergic form is the most common, affecting approximately 40% of the US population. Conjunctivitis can also be classified as acute, chronic, or recurrent, according to the mode of onset and severity of the clinical response. Most cases of viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are considered acute and, less frequently, as hyperacute. The mechanical/irritative/toxic, immune-mediated, and neoplastic forms are typically associated with chronic inflammation, and the toxic form can have an acute onset. Allergic conjunctivitis can be chronic, with possible onset in childhood, and present with acute exacerbations related to seasonal factors or contact lens use, for example.

Conjunctivitis is a highly common presentation in the primary care setting. It is responsible for ~2% of all medical consultations in the United Statesand countless self-referrals to community pharmacies. It is difficult to accurately capture the true epidemiology of conjunctivitis because of the high numbers of patients who may self-medicate or delay or decline to seek medical care, and because of inaccurate diagnosis in the primary medical care setting. Approximately 70% of all patients with acute red eye present to primary care and urgent care, posing a large economic and social burden.–The pharmacoeconomic impact of infectious conjunctivitis is noteworthy and includes the cost of repeat diagnoses, referrals, insurance copays, patient medications, and lost productivity associated with absence from work or school. In the United States, acute conjunctivitis affects an estimated 6 million people per year, and bacterial conjunctivitis treatment alone costs the United States $377–857 million annually. To the best of our knowledge, no health-related quality-of-life studies of patients with acute infectious conjunctivitis have been published.

The purpose of this narrative review is to provide practical guidance on the differentiation of acute infectious conjunctivitis in the primary care setting and to highlight disconnects between diagnosis and treatment.

Conjunctivitis — common features and field care: Among fluorescein‑negative medical eye conditions, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and ultraviolet keratitis can usually be treated in the field and are typically not serious, and conjunctivitis is the most common cause of a red eye. Common etiologies include allergies, viruses, and bacteria; conjunctivitis always involves the palpebral conjunctiva and the examiner must look under the lid to evaluate for this inflammation. The hallmark of allergic conjunctivitis is itching; bacterial conjunctivitis gives a purulent discharge whereas viral conjunctivitis tends to give a watery discharge. Treatment of allergic and viral conjunctivitis is primarily supportive, and bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with antibiotics.

### Ocular manifestations of emerging viral diseases [^113MCD3s]. Eye (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) pose a considerable ongoing threat to humanity. The World Health Organization (WHO) define EIDs as those that are either novel and severely affect a population for the first time, or those that have existed previously but have a rapidly increasing incidence or degree of spread to new geographical areas. Globalisation and climate change have led to an acceleration in the emergence of EID outbreaks in recent times, with the WHO reporting 1483 epidemic events in 172 countries between 2011 and 2018. Since infectious diseases are increasingly extending beyond endemic territories, the clinician should be armed with a global perspective.

Recent outbreaks combined with the development of diagnostic techniques have increasingly allowed characterisation of the ocular manifestations of EIDs. The most prominent outbreaks in recent times have constituted viruses such as the 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, 2015–2016 Zika outbreak in the Americas, a series of increasingly frequent Dengue outbreaks and the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. With the necessary precautions, eye specialists are therefore in a position to facilitate swift diagnosis, improve clinical outcomes and contribute to wider public health efforts during outbreaks. To this end, we provide a timely review of emerging viral diseases for the ophthalmologist (Table 1).

### Sore eyes and psychosis [^111mhyow]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

We present the case of a 30-year-old woman who presented with sexual disinhibition and altered behaviour following an episode of optic neuritis. Her only history was of anxiety disorder. Her differential diagnosis was neurological versus psychiatric. Routine blood tests were unremarkable at this stage. MRI revealed non-specific change and lumbar puncture revealed a slight lymphocytosis and elevated protein and glucose in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). PCR on the CSF was negative for viruses: Adenovirus, varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, enterovirus and parechovirus. She was initially treated with intravenous acyclovir to little effect. Antipsychotics olanzapine and haloperidol were also trialled and continued for 3weeks in total. Once again these medications failed to affect the patient's behaviour but she did begin to show the side effects associated with these medications. Further test results became available at this point-she was anti-N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibody positive. A diagnosis of anti-NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis was made. The patient was started on cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone to good effect.

### Conjunctivitis: a systematic review of diagnosis and treatment [^1138Wf4y]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on infectious conjunctivitis:

- **Definition**: Infectious conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens.
- **Pathophysiology**: Viruses account for 80% of all cases of acute conjunctivitis, with most cases caused by adenoviruses. Other viral causes include HSV, VZV, EBV, influenza, enterovirus, and coxsackievirus. Bacterial conjunctivitis is commonly caused by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. Ophthalmia neonatorum is typically caused by C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae. Fungal conjunctivitis is rare and usually occurs in immunocompromised patients.
- **Epidemiology**: It is estimated that approximately 6 million cases of acute conjunctivitis occur annually in the US.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include close contact with infected individuals, poor hand hygiene, use of contaminated contact lenses, and exposure to contaminated water.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, infectious conjunctivitis presents with redness, itching, tearing, discharge, and crusting. Bacterial conjunctivitis often presents with purulent discharge, while viral conjunctivitis usually has a watery discharge and may be associated with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. Fungal conjunctivitis may present with chronic, indolent symptoms.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Most cases of infectious conjunctivitis are self-limiting, lasting 1–2 weeks. Mild bacterial conjunctivitis typically resolves spontaneously without specific treatment in immunocompetent adults.

### What causes HSV (herpes simplex virus) keratitis… [^111hY21y]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance
- HSV keratitis is an eye infection that can lead to serious eye complications, including scarring of the eye, and blindness when left untreated.
- HSV keratitis can affect individuals who wear contact lenses and those who do not wear them. What is HSV keratitis. HSV keratitis is an infection of the cornea that is caused by HSV. The infection usually heals without damaging the eye, but more severe infections can lead to scarring of the cornea or blindness. HSV keratitis is a major cause of blindness worldwide. HSV is only found in humans and is spread through direct contact with someone who is infected with the virus. Most HSV keratitis infections happen after another part of the body — most commonly the mouth — has already been infected by HSV.

HSV keratitis is often the result of a "flare up" of the earlier infection. Symptoms Symptoms of HSV keratitis include:

- Eye pain
- Eye redness
- Blurred vision
- Sensitivity to light
- Watery discharge If you experience any of these symptoms, remove your contact lenses and call your eye doctor immediately. Prevention methods HSV keratitis can lead to vision loss or blindness if left untreated. Maintain eye health while wearing contact lenses through proper daily habits and regular consultation with an eye doctor.
- Wash hands thoroughly before touching eyes, especially with cold sores or herpes blisters
- Only use prescribed or recommended eye drops by an eye doctor or health care provider. Keep ReadingPreventing Eye Infections when You Wear Contacts HSV keratitis is usually diagnosed based on a patient's health history and eye exam results. Lab testing is not usually necessary, but certain lab tests may further help to confirm HSV-1.

HSV keratitis treatment usually involves medicine, including eye drops or antiviral medications taken by mouth. Surgery is rarely necessary but may be considered if scarring on the eye from HSV keratitis causes vision problems. Each case of HSV keratitis is unique, and an eye doctor should determine the best treatment for each patient. While some treatments can greatly lower the severity and recurrence of symptoms, there is no cure for HSV.

### Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis: anti-coxsackievirus A24 variant secretory immunoglobulin A in acute and convalescent tear [^115qcwPj]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Epidemics of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) have occurred worldwide since the first cases were reported in Accra, Ghana, and Singapore in 1969–1970. Two picornaviruses, enterovirus 70 (EV70) and coxsackievirus A24 variant (CA24v), were isolated and shown to be the etiologic agents of AHC epidemics.–AHC is highly contagious and is transmitted primarily by hand-to-eye-to-hand contact, but fomite and airborne spread is suspected. High attack rates in families and communities are common. High humidity, poor sanitation, overcrowded housing, and school/factory exposure facilitate spread during epidemics. AHC is endemic in several countries where sporadic cases occur annually and local outbreaks and epidemics occur at 3-year to 5-year intervals. Pandemics of AHC involving millions of people have occurred at 8-year to 10-year intervals in tropical and subtropical countries of the eastern and western hemispheres over the past 45 years and 35 years, respectively.–EV70 AHC epidemics have not been reported in the past 5 years, but major CA24v AHC epidemics were reported in the Brazil, French Mayotte Island, Egypt, Uganda/Sudan, India, Indian Ocean islands, Japan, Thailand, and the Zhejiang and Shandong Provinces of the People's Republic of China.–Home remedies are discouraged and are usually deleterious. Measures that prevent spread are employed to limit epidemics, hysteria, and economic losses, since no approved antiviral drugs or vaccines are currently available.

AHC symptoms include rapid onset, profuse tearing, itching/foreign body sensation, pain, erythema, lid edema, vascular dilation of conjunctival blood vessels, with or without chemosis, and subconjunctival hemorrhage that usually subsides steadily after the third day and completely resolves by 10–14 days. The conjunctivitis is caused by virus-induced effects on conjunctival, corneal, and vascular endothelial cells. Ocular host defenses against EV70 and CA24v infection include profuse tearing and conjunctival inflammation with local production of interferon (IFN) and virus-specific neutralizing activity.–These ocular host defenses likely act together to rapidly clear the IFN-sensitive enteroviruses and limit ocular symptoms–but do not prevent secondary CA24v infection of the upper respiratory tractor EV70 neuropathy observed more commonly in males.

### Ocular manifestations of emerging viral diseases [^1126ybLG]. Eye (2021). Medium credibility.

Human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6)

HHV-6 is a double-stranded DNA virus of the β-herpes virus subfamily found worldwide, with two variant species HHV-6A and HHV-6B. Little is known about the acquisition or prevalence of HHV-6A and it is less associated with disease. In contrast, HHV-6B, which has a seroprevalence approaching 100%, with infection typically occurring in childhood. The virus replicates in the salivary glands and is transmitted through the saliva. HHV-6 mRNA has been detected in the ocular fluid sample of a patient with uveitis suggesting that viral replication may occur in the eye. Additional tests for HHV-6 RNA or protein in ocular tissues would provide more definitive evidence of this.

There are typically three stages in the natural history of HHV-6 infection. Acute primary infection in childhood causes exanthem subitum, also called roseola infantum. This is characterised by a high fever followed by a rash that spontaneously resolves. Complications include CNS invasion, hepatitis and pneumonitis, in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients. The second stage occurs in healthy adults and children where the virus remains latent in lymphocytes and monocytes and stays at a low level in tissues. The third stage is due to reactivation from latency or reinfection in immunosuppressed patients.

Ocular conditions of the posterior segment are more commonly associated with HHV-6, though the exact role of HHV-6 in these conditions remains unclear. Posterior segment inflammation associated with HHV-6 includes AIDS-associated retinitis, uveitis and optic neuritis. The prevalence of HHV-6 in ocular fluid samples of patients with ocular inflammation has been found to be 2% or less. The largest study to date found 7/350 patients with uveitis or endophthalmitis tested positive for HHV-6 DNA in ocular fluid samples. The detection of HHV-6 DNA in the eye may not be clinically relevant as all seven patients were found to have other infectious agents in ocular fluid samples. Therefore, it is assumed that HHV-6 infections play a secondary role in the pathogenesis of ocular inflammation. Presence of HHV-6 DNA can be accounted for as it latently resides in immune cells, which may enter the eye during inflammation due to destruction of the blood–retinal barrier. Alternatively, HHV-6 DNA detected in intraocular fluids may be due to release of HHV-6 DNA from resident ocular cells caused by intraocular inflammation and this is supported by findings that HHV-6 can infect human retinal pigment epithelial cells.

### Ocular rosacea: an updated review [^116Xd4kJ]. Cornea (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

Ocular rosacea, classified as subtype IV, is defined by the National Rosacea Expert Committee as the presence of 1 or more of the following signs or symptoms: watery or bloodshot appearance, foreign body sensation, burning or stinging, dryness, itching, light sensitivity, blurred vision, conjunctival and eyelid margin telangiectasias, or eyelid and periocular erythema. Additional signs include blepharitis, conjunctivitis, and irregular eyelid margins; chalazia and styes are also frequent indicators (Figs. 1, 2). Nonetheless, rosacea is primarily diagnosed clinically and lacks specific diagnostic criteria (Table 1).

### SARS-CoV-2 shedding from asymptomatic patients: contribution of potential extrapulmonary tissue reservoirs [^117D9Edk]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The current pandemic COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly spreading across the globe, with more than 3 million infections and more than 200,000 deaths worldwide. The receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is expressed in the lungs, heart, kidneys, intestines, brain, eyes, and testicles. Infection of these extrapulmonary organs (eyes, gastrointestinal tract, and brain)has been reported. Viral shedding in asymptomatic individuals and recovered patients after the cessation of respiratory symptoms, has been documented. Although SARS-CoV-2 positivity of recovered patients may be interpreted as reinfection, failure to reinfect monkeys in the laboratory settingargues against the possibility of reinfection and suggests the likelihood of extrapulmonary reservoirs in the infected individuals. Considering this possibility, this perspective is focused on extrapulmonary organs affected by SARS-CoV-2 and the implications of their involvement for disease transmission, clinical management strategies, and medical countermeasure discovery and development.

SARS-CoV-2 and extrapulmonary tissues and organs.

In addition to the primary respiratory route of infection via droplets or contact with fomites, the expression of ACE2 in aqueous humorand neural tissue of the retinasuggest a potential role of transmission via an ocular route. The ocular reservoir can harbor low viral load, even before transmission to other organs such as the throat or lungs, as 75% of tears drain into the inferior meatus of the nasal cavity and to the back of the throat. Red eyes, conjunctivitis, conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, or increased secretions are observed in a minority of patients, along with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in tears. Although viral RNA is infrequently detected (1–5%) in tears, ocular manifestations are relatively common in COVID-19–positive patients (10–30%). This could be due in part to timing of sample collection, fluctuations in virus shedding, and variability in testing methods. Standardized approaches for sample collection along with more sensitive testing methods may yield more robust data. Additional research is needed to confirm the temporal correlation between conjunctivitis and viral shedding in COVID-19 patients.

### Conjunctivitis: diagnosis and management [^114ZswsT]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Conjunctivitis caused by viruses, bacteria, or allergies is one of the most common eye conditions in primary care. There is no single sign or symptom that accurately differentiates viral from bacterial conjunctivitis. A comprehensive history and physical examination can guide diagnosis. Viral and allergic conjunctivitis are more common in adults and typically present with watery discharge. Supportive care options for viral conjunctivitis include artificial tears, cold compresses, and antihistamine eye drops. Strict personal hygiene, including frequent handwashing, is essential to decrease the risk of transmission. Topical antihistamines with mast cell-stabilizing activity are the treatment of choice for allergic conjunctivitis. Bacterial conjunctivitis is more common in children and typically presents as mucopurulent discharge with the eyelids matted shut. Delayed antibiotic prescribing has been found to have similar symptom control as immediate prescribing. Ophthalmology referral is indicated for conjunctivitis in a neonate or patients with severe pain, decreased vision, recent ocular surgery, vesicular rash on the eyelids or nose, history of rheumatologic disease, or immunocompromised state.

### Sore eyes as the most significant ocular symptom experienced by people with COVID-19: a comparison between pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 States [^115Pdd9Z]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of COVID-19, which has been shown to be primarily a respiratory illness, with the most common symptoms being a new continuous cough and high temperature. Further symptoms have been added to this list, and the WHO added conjunctivitis a less common symptom. Ocular manifestations of COVID-19 have not been at the forefront of substantial research, possibly due to the life-threatening nature of the other more serious respiratory symptoms which have resulted in high numbers of mortality around the world. This might have resulted in other non-life-threatening symptoms not given importance in the presence of other life-threatening conditions. However, the type, frequency and ocular transmission of the virus must not be ignored, especially as the eye has been recognised as one of the organs through which the virus might enter the body.

Diagnosis is typically confirmed by laboratory testing using ELISA to detect IgM in serum of cerebrospinal fluid, and in limited scenarios supported by RT-PCR. There is no vaccine, treatment is supportive, with vector control as the mainstay of prevention.

Yellow fever virus (Flaviviridae)

The yellow fever virus (YFV) is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family. It is an arbovirus transmitted to humans primarily through the bite of infected Aedes or Haemagogus species mosquitoes, and principally maintained by a sylvatic (jungle) transmission cycle between mosquitoes and non-human primates and mosquito–human transmission cycles in urban areas, the latter leading to outbreaks of yellow fever (YF) in human populations. Dozens of countries in both Africa and South and Central America are endemic for YF, leading to an estimated 30,000–60,000 fatalities per year.

The majority infected with YFV are asymptomatic or exhibit an initial phase of non-specific viral symptoms after 3–6 days (fever, myalgia, nausea and vomiting), which then resolves within days. After less than a day of resolution, 15–25% of patients develop a toxic form of the disease, with fever, a haemorrhagic diathesis and multi-organ failure (especially renal and hepatic) leading to a 50% mortality rate.

### Ocular and systemic complications of COVID-19: impact on patients and healthcare [^11528Kkt]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

COVID-19 has caused significant complications on the systemic and ocular health of patients and strained the global healthcare system. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly infectious, and patients with diabetes, immunosuppression, cardiopulmonary diseases, and metabolic syndromes may be more susceptible. Preventative methods include social distancing, masks, and vaccinations. For those who do contract the virus, systemic treatment options include monoclonal antibodies and antiviral agents in those at risk for severe disease, therapeutic dose heparin in non-critically ill hospitalized patients, JAK inhibitors to decrease the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality, IL-6 antagonists in patients with severe or critical COVID-19, and steroids in hospitalized patients requiring oxygen support. Most patients recover from the respiratory illness, but some may develop persistent pulmonary disease and fatigue. While the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the vaccines may both be associated with inflammatory or neurologic issues, the benefits of vaccinations far outweigh the rare potential complications.

In the eyes, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been found in the conjunctiva, tear film, and retina, and it can cause conjunctivitis, microvascular disease, and cranial neuropathies. Fortunately, most ocular issues resolved, with or without treatment.

During the initial wave of the pandemic and quarantine period, there was a significant reduction in the clinical and surgical volumes. Teleophthalmology helped to minimize the risks of in-person evaluations for non-urgent issues. Those who did present to the emergency departments tended to have more severe disease and worse visual outcomes, and patients who had delayed their routine outpatient ophthalmic care had difficulty returning to their baseline statuses even after restarting treatments. Resumption of ophthalmic treatments as soon as possible may therefore help decrease the risk of vision loss. Continued financial support of ophthalmic businesses and research will help preserve the availability of ophthalmologists and prevent the loss of scientific advancement. Supplemental virtual didactics may help prepare the next generation of physicians and ophthalmologists.

Ongoing research has shed greater insight into how the virus affects the human body, potential treatment options, and the effects of delayed care for ophthalmic diseases. The lessons and insights gained from researchers around the world will hopefully help improve patient care as the pandemic continues.

### Viral exanthems [^112uGnjz]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Determining the viral cause of a rash presents significant diagnostic challenges. We review contemporary literature on viral exanthems and suggest a structured approach to aid diagnosis.

Recent Findings

Strains responsible for, and the clinical presentation of, enteroviral infections have diverged from classic descriptions. The causative relationship between antibiotic administration and rash in Epstein-Barr virus infection has been recently questioned. Major measles virus outbreaks have recently occurred in Europe and the USA. The largest Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa has resulted in importation of the virus to other countries and secondary local transmission. Autochthonous transmission of Chikungunya virus has occurred in nonendemic areas, including Europe, the Caribbean and Americas. Zika virus has re-emerged in the Pacific with local transmission from imported cases. Climate change, global warming and spillover of zoonotic viruses are contributing to the emergence and spread of viral diseases.

Summary

Important clues to the diagnosis of viral exanthems include their distribution and morphology, geographic location and potential exposure to vector-borne or blood-borne viruses. Diagnosis is commonly made via serology, nucleic acid tests or, rarely, viral culture. Skin biopsy is not usually required. In general, viral exanthems are self-limiting and treatment is supportive.

### Ocular manifestations of emerging viral diseases [^116WNj7Q]. Eye (2021). Medium credibility.

Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are an increasing threat to public health on a global scale. In recent times, the most prominent outbreaks have constituted RNA viruses, spreading via droplets (COVID-19 and Influenza A H1N1), directly between humans (Ebola and Marburg), via arthropod vectors (Dengue, Zika, West Nile, Chikungunya, Crimean Congo) and zoonotically (Lassa fever, Nipah, Rift Valley fever, Hantaviruses). However, specific approved antiviral therapies and vaccine availability are scarce, and public health measures remain critical. Patients can present with a spectrum of ocular manifestations. Emerging infectious diseases should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of ocular inflammatory conditions in patients inhabiting or returning from endemic territories, and more general vigilance is advisable in the context of a global pandemic. Eye specialists are in a position to facilitate swift diagnosis, improve clinical outcomes, and contribute to wider public health efforts during outbreaks. This article reviews those emerging viral diseases associated with reports of ocular manifestations and summarizes details pertinent to practicing eye specialists.

### Ocular manifestations of emerging viral diseases [^116E4nRe]. Eye (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary

The threat of emerging viral disease has been made all the more clear in the midst of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Further, the possibility that a yet unknown pathogen could cause a future epidemic has also been acknowledged by the WHO on their shortlist of blueprint priority diseases as 'Disease X'. It has been estimated that there are 1.67 million unknown viruses circulating in animal reservoirs and there remains the potential for them to evolve and transmit to humans. It is interesting that the majority of new 'threats' have ocular manifestations.

Ophthalmologists should therefore be mindful of the variation of presentations of eye diseases in this context. The COVID-19 pandemic and studies of other viral diseases highlight that globalisation and modernisation play a significant role in the spread of viral disease and consequently returning travellers could present with manifestations of both current known and novel viral diseases. An awareness of the ocular manifestations of emerging viral diseases can therefore enable eye specialists to facilitate swift diagnosis, improve clinical outcomes and contribute to wider public health efforts during outbreaks.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^117SpSi8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis can be difficult. Clinical ambiguity exists between the acute viral and bacterial as well as the allergic forms, which can confound diagnosis. Also, discrimination between viral or bacterial origins of infectious conjunctivitis based on historical, nonspecific, clinical signs and symptoms contributes to a high rate of misdiagnosis and overuse of antibiotic treatment. Therefore, in order to effectively treat acute infectious conjunctivitis, physicians must be aware of the clinical signs and symptoms and available diagnostic tests that can provide a more accurate differential diagnosis.

### Ocular manifestations of emerging viral diseases [^111G6twC]. Eye (2021). Medium credibility.

In its most common mild form, RVF is characterised by fever and non-specific flu-like symptoms. In a small percentage of cases, a severe form develops, categorised into three syndromic presentations: ocular disease with risk of permanent loss of vision; meningoencephalitis with confusion and potentially coma; and haemorrhagic fever with liver involvement and jaundice, this being the most fatal form.

Ocular manifestations are well-documented, and present symptomatically with blurred vision, decreased vision, floaters, scotomatous areas or periocular pain. The classical manifestation is of macular or paramacular retinitis (Fig. 2). It is difficult to estimate the true incidence of ocular complications in RVF, as total case numbers in outbreaks are not known and incidences in case series from different outbreaks vary significantly. However, the WHO estimates an incidence of 0.5–2% patients. The largest series to date looked at 143 patients (212 eyes) all with macular or paramacular retinitis and serologically proved RVF in the 2000 Saudi Arabian outbreak. Onset of visual symptoms ranged from 4 to 15 days. Associated lesions included retinal haemorrhages (40% of eyes), vitreous retractions (26%), optic disc oedema (15%) and retinal vasculitis (7%, mostly phlebitis, occasionally arteritis). A single creamy-white area of retinal necrosis was typically seen on fundoscopy reflecting retinitis, alongside the other described associated lesions. Fluorescence angiography demonstrated an early hypofluorescence of the area of retinitis and delayed filling of arterioles and venules, with late staining of the retinal lesion and blood vessels. Active lesions largely resolved over a 9-month follow-up, leaving behind chorioretinal scarring, and in some cases vascular occlusion and optic atrophy. Seventy-one percent of eyes remained legally blind at the end of follow-up, compared to 40–50% permanent visual loss reported in previous studies. Fifty-one eyes also developed a transient mild-to-moderate anterior uveitis, which appeared non-granulomatous.

### Viral ocular manifestations: a broad overview [^11437Pwh]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2013). Low credibility.

The viruses able to affect the eye are taxonomically diverse, ranging from double-stranded DNA viruses, to single stranded RNA viruses, to retroviruses. Any part of the eye may be affected, frequently producing blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, uveitis, cataract and retinitis. The more common ocular viral infections include the Herpesviruses such as HSV-1, VZV and CMV. The HIV pandemic is placing a serious burden on ophthalmology clinics, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa as the number of viral ocular diseases is increasing. In particular, CMV retinitis is becoming more prevalent where antiretroviral therapy is not available and is replaced by immune-recovery uveitis where antiretrovirals are given. This review aims to improve knowledge of the common viral ocular diseases, their diagnosis and management, as well as the fairly uncommon viral ocular diseases that may also cause considerable morbidity.

### Diagnosis and management of red eye in primary care [^115y7vo5]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Red eye is the cardinal sign of ocular inflammation. The condition is usually benign and can be managed by primary care physicians. Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of red eye. Other common causes include blepharitis, corneal abrasion, foreign body, subconjunctival hemorrhage, keratitis, iritis, glaucoma, chemical burn, and scleritis. Signs and symptoms of red eye include eye discharge, redness, pain, photophobia, itching, and visual changes. Generally, viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are self-limiting conditions, and serious complications are rare. Because there is no specific diagnostic test to differentiate viral from bacterial conjunctivitis, most cases are treated using broad-spectrum antibiotics. Allergies or irritants also may cause conjunctivitis. The cause of red eye can be diagnosed through a detailed patient history and careful eye examination, and treatment is based on the underlying etiology. Recognizing the need for emergent referral to an ophthalmologist is key in the primary care management of red eye. Referral is necessary when severe pain is not relieved with topical anesthetics; topical steroids are needed; or the patient has vision loss, copious purulent discharge, corneal involvement, traumatic eye injury, recent ocular surgery, distorted pupil, herpes infection, or recurrent infections.

### Global landscape of coxsackieviruses in human health [^1168Hc6M]. Virus Research (2024). Medium credibility.

3.9 Coxsackieviruses and ocular manifestations

A wide variety of viral diseases have ocular manifestations that include retinitis, blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, uveitis, and optic neuritis. Although adenovirus is the most common cause of viral ocular infections, enteroviruses, particularly the coxsackieviruses group are pointed out as causative agents of several ocular manifestations. In fact, many reports have described an association of different CV types (CVA4, CVA9, CVA16, CVB1-B6) with various retinopathies, such as unilateral acute idiopathic maculopathy, unilateral multifocal retinitis, bilateral obstructive retinal vasculitis, and unilateral chorioretinitis (Table 1). It is unknown what pathophysiological mechanisms lead to CV damage in these eye diseases. Direct viral infection of the outer retina and an immune-mediated response triggered by viral infection are the two main hypotheses. It's important to highlight that some ocular manifestations can emerge following the onset of hand-foot-and-mouth disease, particularly in children. Additionally, significant visual impairment associated with corneal endothelitis has also been linked to coxsackieviral infection (CVA24). However, the most common ocular manifestation associated with CV infection is acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC), a highly contagious viral disease that causes painful conjunctive and subconjunctival hemorrhage, foreign body sensation, and photophobia, amongst other symptoms. Worldwide, a pathogenic variant of CVA24 (CVA2Av) has emerged as responsible for large AHC outbreaks, which pose a serious threat to public health, especially in densely populated areas. Apart from CVA24v, a recent study reported an outbreak of CVA6-related AHC in adults.

### Concurrent and post COVID-19 ophthalmological implications [^111Vk6EV]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Three members of the corona virus family can cause severe respiratory illness that may lead to death. They are the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. Beside the typical respiratory manifestations of COVID-19, other body systems including the eye are now known to be affected by SARS CoV virus as well. The virus can affect the eye in several ways and ocular manifestations have a wide range. This may include conjunctivitis, keratitis, episcleritisand retinal hemorrhage or cotton wool spots. The published reports of the ocular manifestations caused by COVID-19 showed different incidence, but generally it was low.

As COVID-19 pandemic is still going, on new symptoms, signs and post-infection complications become apparent. These complications could affect the heart, liver, brain and other organs, however, the respiratory complications remain the main cause of death.

After more than one year of COVID-19 in Egypt, this study retrospectively reviewed the records of COVID-19 patients to find out the ophthalmological manifestations of those patients.

### A bird's eye view on the role of dendritic cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection: perspectives for immune-based vaccines [^1154usZC]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a complex disorder caused by the pandemic diffusion of a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. Clinical manifestations vary from silent infection to severe pneumonia, disseminated thrombosis, multi-organ failure, and death. COVID-19 pathogenesis is still not fully elucidated, while increasing evidence suggests that disease phenotypes are strongly related to the virus-induced immune system's dysregulation. Indeed, when the virus-host cross talk is out of control, the occurrence of an aberrant systemic inflammatory reaction, named "cytokine storm", leads to a detrimental impairment of the adaptive immune response. Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent antigen-presenting cells able to support innate immune and promote adaptive responses. Besides, DCs play a key role in the anti-viral defense. The aim of this review is to focus on DC involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection to better understand pathogenesis and clinical behavior of COVID-19 and explore potential implications for immune-based therapy strategies.

### The role of the ocular tissue in SARS-CoV-2 transmission [^116ZZFhN]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

The current global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected over 21 million people and caused over half a million deaths within a few months. COVID-19 has become one of the most severe public health crises in recent years. Compared to other pathogenic coronaviruses, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly infectious. Due to the lack of specific and effective treatment or vaccines, disease prevention and early detection are essential for establishing guidelines to mitigate further spread. The potential role of the ocular system in COVID-19 is still not clear but it has gained increasing attention. Here, we reviewed both clinical and research evidence on the ocular manifestations associated with COVID-19, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in ocular surface tissues and tears, and the potential role of the eye in contracting SARS-CoV-2.

### Low circulating B cells in immunocompromised individuals are linked to poorer antibody responses to vaccines and a predisposition to viral infections [^114N4w67]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2023). Medium credibility.

Adult patients who were either diagnosed with or under investigation for an immunodeficiency were included to the study (see the Supplementary Methods in the Online Repository at). Information on all viral infections during the period which patients were under observation at those sites was collected (mean = 82.2 months per patient; range = 6.1–172.5). Viral infections were classified as (1) chronic, if present for more than 6 weeks; (2) recurrent, if recorded on at least 3 separate occasions more than 3 weeks apart; (3) severe, if invasive or resulting in hospital admission; (4) atypical, if detected in otherwise sterile sites (eg, blood, ocular fluid); and (5) other, if not falling into any of the aforementioned categories. The ratio of viral PCR-positive results to total viral PCR assays performed was also recorded using information provided by the regional laboratory electronic system. CBCC measurements were also collected by using the regional laboratory electronic system (mean = 2.1 measurements per patient; range = 1–14). A generalized linear model was used to analyze the relationship between CBCC and each of the relevant responses while controlling for patient age, diagnosis group, and T-cell and natural killer cell counts.

### Pathogenicity and transmissibility of bovine H5N1 influenza virus [^115dUg6d]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Source Data

To examine tissue tropism after intranasal infection, we inoculated female BALB/cJ mice with 10³ PFU of Cow-H5N1, VN1203-H5N1 or a pandemic H1N1 influenza virus (A/Isumi/UT-KK001–01/2018, 'Isumi-H1N1')for comparison (ten mice per group). Three and 6 days later, five mice in each group were euthanized, tissues (blood, eye, teat, mammary gland, brain, intestine, liver, spleen, kidney, heart, nasal turbinate, trachea, lung, hamstring and latissimus dorsi) were collected and virus titres were determined by performing plaque assays in Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (Fig. 2c). For Cow-H5N1 and VN1203-H5N1, virus titres on day 6 were generally higher than those on day 3. Both viruses caused systemic infections with high titres in respiratory and non-respiratory organs, including the mammary glands, teats and muscle tissues of the leg (hamstring) and back (latissimus dorsi). Virus was also found in the eye of a single mouse infected with VN1203-H5N1 (Fig. 2c), and in a similar experiment (performed under the same conditions, but without Isumi-H1N1 infections or collection of blood or muscle tissue), we found both Cow-H5N1 and VN1203-H5N1 in eyes (Extended Data Fig. 2). The consistent detection of HPAI H5N1 virus in the mammary glands and muscle tissues, and its sporadic detection in the eyes of mice is consistent with reports of HPAI H5N1 virus in the mammary glands, and muscle tissues of cowsand with reports of conjunctivitis and respiratory symptoms in humans infected with an HPAI H5N1 virus related to the outbreak in cattle. In contrast to Cow-H5N1 and VN1203-H5N1, the Isumi-H1N1 virus was detected only in the respiratory tissues of mice (Fig. 2c). As Cow-H5N1 and VN1203-H5N1 (but not Isumi-H1N1) were also found in the blood, it is possible that viral spread to non-respiratory tissues occurred through viremia.

### Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection following occupational ocular exposure [^113sHxmi]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A man in his mid-20s presented to the occupational health service following an ocular projection with a concentrated solution of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV clone-13). Subsequently, a regular clinical and biological follow-up was initiated. 7 days after exposure, the patient developed influenza-like symptoms. During the acute phase, specific RT-PCR testing of blood plasma was negative for LCMV. Symptomatic treatment was administered, and the symptoms resolved after a few days. The patient remained asymptomatic in the following weeks. Serological follow-up detected a seroconversion 6 weeks after exposure, indicating a recent infection. The occupational health service's protocol, comprising clinical monitoring and serological surveillance, facilitated the detection of seroconversion. This case underscores ocular mucosal exposure as a route of occupational LCMV transmission, which is often not considered. It served as an opportunity to review and enhance prevention measures and laboratory protocols within the biosafety level P2 facility.

### Early impact of COVID-19 outbreak on the availability of cornea donors: warnings and recommendations [^114b3hPu]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Keratoplasty is one of the irreplaceable treatment options for corneal diseases. Currently, there is no evidence to substantiate that harvested corneal grafts from COVID-19 patients can contain SARS-CoV-2 virus and lead to a systemic infection. Although the risk of transmission through corneal stromal tissue is low, it potentially exists. Lack of clinical data, unclear potential of donor-derived infection and non-established recommendations for transplantation during the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number of keratoplasty and cornea donors at ophthalmology departments and eye banks. To eliminate the risk of infection of recipients and medical personnel, we suggest that the blood samples of all donors should be screened with RT-PCR tests and nasopharyngeal swabs should be taken. In addition, a chest CT scan should be performed if the circulation is maintained. Moreover, the donors' clinical and epidemiological medical history must be screened for typical symptoms and potential contact with SARS-CoV-2 carriers to reduce the risk of transmission. The Guidelines of the Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA), Global Alliance of Eye Bank Associations (GAEBA) and European Association of Tissue Banks provide useful recommendations to eliminate the risk of transmission according to previous experiences based on similar viruses.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^114UAb65]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) culture and tissue-based diagnostics — turnaround and evidence of causation: A positive blood buffy-coat culture establishes CMV infection and increases the likelihood that disease or symptoms are caused by CMV because children with CMV-positive blood cultures are at higher risk of end-organ disease, and recovery of virus from tissues with supportive histopathology provides evidence of disease causation in symptomatic patients. The limitation of cell culture is that detection of visible cytopathic effects in cell culture takes 1 to 6 weeks, whereas staining of shell vial culture or tissue for CMV antigens can allow earlier diagnosis and using centrifugation-assisted shell vial culture amplification techniques, CMV can be detected within 16 to 40 hours of culture inoculation; histopathology demonstrates characteristic "owl's eye" intranuclear and smaller intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in biopsy specimens, and staining can also be done on cells obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage.

### Natalizumab (Tysabri) [^1136Ndms]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Herpes Infections

Inform patients that TYSABRI increases the risk of developing encephalitis and meningitis, which could be fatal, and acute retinal necrosis, which could lead to blindness, caused by the family of herpes viruses (e.g., herpes simplex and varicella zoster viruses). Instruct patients to immediately report any possible symptoms of encephalitis and meningitis (such as fever, headache, and confusion) or acute retinal necrosis (such as decreased visual acuity, eye redness, or eye pain) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Hepatotoxicity

Inform patients that TYSABRI may cause liver injury. Instruct patients treated with TYSABRI to report promptly any symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Instruct patients to report immediately if they experience symptoms consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., urticaria with or without associated symptoms) during or following an infusion of TYSABRI [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Immunosuppression/Infections

Inform patients that TYSABRI may lower the ability of their immune system to fight infections. Instruct the patient of the importance of contacting their doctor if they develop any symptoms of infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Hematological Abnormalities

Inform patients that Tysabri may cause a low platelet count, which can cause severe bleeding that may be life-threatening. Instruct patients to report any symptoms that may indicate thrombocytopenia, such as easy bruising, prolonged bleeding from cuts, petechiae, abnormally heavy menstrual periods, or bleeding from the nose or gums that is new. Advise patients that TYSABRI may cause low platelet or red blood cell counts in neonates exposed to TYSABRI during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precuations (5.8)].

Pregnancy

Instruct patients that if they become pregnant or plan to become pregnant while taking TYSABRI they should inform their healthcare provider [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Ocular manifestations of emerging viral diseases [^115XMPYb]. Eye (2021). Medium credibility.

Methodology

Emerging viral diseases were identified for inclusion using the WHO list of designated 'priority' pathogens as well as an initial scoping literature search for emerging viral diseases with ocular manifestations. For each virus identified for inclusion, an in-depth literature search was performed using MEDLINE's database, with variations on virus name, emerging disease, and ocular manifestations, as key search terms. Studies selected were in English and pertaining to humans. Searches were supplemented by reviewing reference lists of relevant papers. The viruses discussed will be grouped according to the mechanism of transmission and family.

### The epidemiology of non-polio enteroviruses: recent advances and outstanding questions [^112V4W4i]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There are over 100 serotypes of human enteroviruses, which cause a spectrum of illnesses, including meningitis, encephalitis, paralysis, myocarditis and rash. Increasing incidence of hand-foot-and-mouth disease in the Asia-Pacific region and recent outbreaks of enterovirus-associated disease, such as severe respiratory illness in the United States in 2014, highlight the threat of these viruses to human health.

Recent Findings

We describe recent outbreaks of human enteroviruses and summarize knowledge gaps regarding their burden, spectrum of diseases and epidemiology.

Summary

Reported outbreaks of respiratory, neurological, skin and eye diseases associated with human enteroviruses have increased in frequency and size in recent years. Improved molecular diagnostics and genetic sequence analysis are beginning to reveal the complex dynamics of individual serotypes and genotypes, and their contribution to these outbreaks. However, the biological mechanisms underlying their emergence and transmission dynamics remain elusive. They are likely to involve changes in the virus, such as fitness, antigenicity, virulence or tropism, and in the human population, such as levels of sanitation and of homotypic and heterotypic immunity. Improvements in surveillance, serological surveys and detailed genetic and antigenic characterization of viral populations would help to elucidate these mechanisms. This will be important for the design of outbreak control and vaccine development strategies.

### Pediatricians' knowledge, attitude and practice on treating children with red eye disease [^114Fiw8h]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatricians play an important role in the early detection and prompt treatment of ocular disorders in children, including red eye disease. Our aim was to examine the knowledge level of pediatricians regarding treating children with red eye disease, as well as the factors that affect the knowledge level, and the potential implications of a low level of knowledge.

Methods

In this correlational quantitative study, 152 expert pediatricians completed a questionnaire that included questions on knowledge, attitudes, and experience in treating red eye disease.

Results

Respondents' mean level of knowledge was moderate. Most of the respondents (89.5%) knew that the most likely diagnosis for a child with red eyes and a discharge is viral conjunctivitis and that pain, blurred vision, and a clouded cornea, are symptoms indicative of a more complex systemic problem. In contrast, 78.3% of the pediatricians claimed that the treatment of choice for viral conjunctivitis is a conservative treatment that includes eye flushing and strict hygiene. However, 14.5% (n = 22) of the pediatricians were found to prescribe antibiotics. A negative association was found between the pediatrician's age and years of experience, and level of knowledge concerning treatment of children with red eye. A strong positive association was found between pediatricians' level of knowledge and their attitudes to performing eye tests. Moreover, a negative association was found between the level of knowledge and the number of cases in which pediatricians prescribed antibiotics for children with red eye.

Conclusions

The research findings indicate that lack of knowledge was more conspicuous among pediatricians with more experience. Knowledge appears to be critical both for readiness to treat red eye and for proper treatment. It is necessary to provide pediatricians with tools for treating eye disorders in children and to refresh their knowledge on red eye, particularly among pediatricians with more years of experience.

### The review of ophthalmic symptoms in COVID-19 [^111YFxQe]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 had a significant impact on the health of the global human population, affecting almost every human organ, including the organ of vision. Research focus on understanding the pathophysiology, identifying symptoms and complications of the disease. Eye-related pathologies are important foci of research due to the potential for direct impact of the virus. Ophthalmologists around the world are reporting various symptoms of eye infections and ocular pathologies associated with SARS-CoV-2. The review of ophthalmic symptoms was conducted to help physicians of various specialties recognize possible ophthalmic manifestations of this viral disease. A literature review was conducted from January 2020 to July 2023 in the PubMed, MEDLINE, Science Direct, Scopus, Scielo and Google Scholar databases. The review of the literature showed that conjunctivitis is the most common ophthalmic symptom observed during the course of COVID-19 and can occur at any stage of the disease. Changes in the eye may result from the direct effect of the virus, immune response, prothrombotic states, comorbidities, and medications used. Symptoms related to the organ of vision can be divided into: changes affecting the protective apparatus of the eye, the anterior eye segment, the posterior eye segment, neuro-ophthalmic, and orbital changes. Ocular symptoms may suggest COVID-19 infection or appear several weeks after recovery. Following COVID-19 vaccinations, a diverse range of ophthalmic symptoms was observed in various locations and at different times, mirroring the ocular symptoms experienced throughout the course of the COVID-19 illness. It is important for physicians of all specialties to be aware of possible potential connections between eye diseases and SARS-CoV-2, in order to effectively diagnose and treat patients.
