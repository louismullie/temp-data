## Question

How can an RN plan impact a patient's outcome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how a registered nurse's (RN) plan can impact a patient's outcome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes an "RN plan" across settings. Then, I should verify the mechanisms by which nursing plans influence outcomes. Next, I will appraise the strength and consistency of evidence by outcome domain. After that, I need to consider moderators that amplify or blunt effect sizes. Finally, I will translate this into practical implications and acknowledge limitations where the evidence is weak or heterogeneous.

> Let me first confirm what "RN plan" encompasses in practice and research. An RN plan is not a single template; it includes individualized nursing care plans embedded in the nursing process, nurse-led or nurse-coordinated programs such as advance care planning, discharge/transition plans, chronic disease action plans, and participation in multidisciplinary clinical pathways, all of which operationalize assessment, diagnosis, outcomes, interventions, and evaluation with patient input and team coordination [^111r1CUM] [^111CaRkT] [^115feiaN].

> I will now examine the mechanisms by which RN plans plausibly change outcomes. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the causal pathways. Mechanisms include: 1) aligning care with patient goals and preferences to improve satisfaction and goal-concordant care; 2) enhancing self-management capabilities through education and action plans; 3) improving care coordination and transitions to reduce errors and utilization; 4) embedding evidence-based protocols to standardize best practices; and 5) enabling timely monitoring and iterative plan adjustments to prevent deterioration, with these mechanisms supported by person-centered care frameworks and implementation science principles [^115zbdDy] [^113Jc7v8] [^115ysRnM].

> Next, I should review the strength of evidence by outcome domain, starting with end-of-life and goal-concordant care. High-quality randomized trials show that facilitated advance care planning by trained non-physician facilitators (often nurses) dramatically increases the likelihood that end-of-life wishes are known and respected and reduces stress, anxiety, and depression in surviving relatives, indicating large, clinically meaningful effects on process and surrogate outcomes even when mortality is unchanged [^112xCJXV] [^112EP24D] [^1145Jzw3].

> Let me consider chronic disease self-management and physiological outcomes. Moderate-quality evidence from Cochrane and related reviews shows personalized care planning improves glycemic control (about a 0.24% HbA1c reduction), lowers systolic blood pressure (~2.6 mmHg), reduces depression symptoms, and enhances self-efficacy and self-care activities, with larger effects when the intervention is more comprehensive, frequent, and integrated into usual care, which aligns with nurse-led chronic care models [^115feiaN].

> I should double-check utilization and safety outcomes. Clinical pathways likely reduce in-hospital complications and length of stay, though mortality effects are uncertain and evidence quality varies; similarly, COPD action plans with brief education plus follow-up reduce hospitalizations and ED visits without changing mortality, and nurse-led transition programs show signals for reduced readmissions, albeit with heterogeneity and modest certainty, so I need to be cautious about overgeneralization [^111CaRkT] [^1159gnB3] [^114syEju].

> But wait, what if the plan is not implemented faithfully or the context is unfavorable? I need to ensure I account for moderators. Effects are stronger when nurses have dedicated time, training, and authority; when plans are co-created with patients and caregivers; when there is team buy-in and EHR integration; and when there is ongoing follow-up to close loops, whereas high workloads, fragmented systems, and lack of documentation blunt impact, as shown in process evaluations and staffing studies [^116gX9u2] [^116tkcPe] [^115ysRnM].

> Let me translate this into practical implications for RNs. First, invest in comprehensive assessment to identify patient goals, social determinants, and barriers, then co-create measurable, time-bound outcomes. Second, embed evidence-based protocols and order sets to reduce unwarranted variation. Third, coordinate across settings using shared plans and EHR flags. Fourth, build in follow-up checkpoints to monitor progress and adjust the plan. Fifth, document not just tasks but the rationale and patient preferences to support continuity and goal concordance [^115zbdDy] [^111CaRkT] [^111r1CUM].

> Hold on, I should verify limitations so we do not overstate benefits. Many nursing interventions are complex and context-dependent, leading to heterogeneity and low-to-moderate certainty in some meta-analyses; nurse staffing and missed care likely mediate plan effectiveness, and many studies do not isolate the unique contribution of the RN plan from the broader intervention package, so causal attribution requires careful interpretation and, ideally, process evaluations [^111CaRkT] [^116tkcPe] [^115ysRnM].

> In summary, RN plans impact patient outcomes through multiple, synergistic mechanisms: aligning care with patient goals, strengthening self-management, improving coordination, and enabling evidence-based, adaptive care. The strongest evidence shows large improvements in goal-concordant end-of-life care and surrogate distress, moderate improvements in chronic disease control and self-efficacy, and likely reductions in complications and length of stay, with magnitude contingent on fidelity, intensity, and system support, so RNs should treat planning as a dynamic, collaborative process rather than a one-time document [^112xCJXV] [^115feiaN] [^111CaRkT].

An RN care plan improves patient outcomes by ensuring **individualized, evidence-based care** that aligns with patient goals and preferences [^115zbdDy] [^115feiaN]. It enhances **care coordination**, reduces errors, and supports **self-management**, leading to better adherence, fewer complications, and improved quality of life [^111CaRkT] [^1159gnB3]. RN plans also enable early detection of changes, timely interventions, and smoother transitions, which can reduce readmissions and healthcare costs [^114syEju] [^111CaRkT]. Overall, RN care plans are a cornerstone of safe, effective, patient-centered care that measurably improves outcomes [^115zbdDy].

---

## Individualized patient-centered care

- **Tailored interventions**: RN plans are built on comprehensive assessments that capture physical, psychological, social, and cultural needs, enabling interventions that fit the patient's unique context [^115zbdDy] [^113Jc7v8].

- **Goal alignment**: By involving patients in setting realistic, measurable goals, RN plans increase engagement and adherence, which improves outcomes such as symptom control, functional status, and satisfaction [^115feiaN] [^115zbdDy].

- **Shared decision-making**: RN plans facilitate discussions that incorporate patient preferences, leading to goal-concordant care and better quality of life, especially in chronic and end-of-life settings [^115zbdDy] [^112xCJXV].

---

## Enhanced care coordination and communication

- **Multidisciplinary collaboration**: RN plans provide a structured communication tool for teams, reducing fragmentation and ensuring consistent, coordinated care across settings [^115zbdDy] [^113Jc7v8].

- **Reduced errors**: Clear documentation of medications, interventions, and goals minimizes errors, omissions, and duplications, improving safety and outcomes [^111CaRkT].

- **Smooth transitions**: RN-led discharge and transition plans reduce readmissions and improve continuity by ensuring follow-up, medication reconciliation, and patient education are in place [^114syEju] [^112opL8m].

---

## Early detection and timely intervention

RN plans include **ongoing monitoring** and predefined triggers that enable early recognition of deterioration or complications, prompting timely interventions to prevent escalation [^115zbdDy]. They also support **preventive care** by incorporating immunizations, screenings, and health promotion, reducing adverse events and improving long-term outcomes [^116Yf1Jp].

---

## Patient education and self-management

- **Empowerment**: RN plans include education on medications, symptoms, and lifestyle, improving adherence and self-efficacy, which are linked to better outcomes in chronic disease [^115feiaN] [^1159gnB3].

- **Action plans**: For conditions like COPD and asthma, nurse-provided action plans reduce hospitalizations and ED visits by enabling early symptom management [^1159gnB3] [^116D8oij].

- **Behavior change**: Personalized education and motivational strategies in RN plans support smoking cessation, diet, and exercise, improving clinical indicators and quality of life [^115feiaN] [^115zbdDy].

---

## Evidence-based practice and quality improvement

RN plans embed **evidence-based guidelines** and protocols, standardizing care and increasing adherence to best practices, which improves outcomes such as reduced infections, shorter length of stay, and better symptom control [^111CaRkT] [^1159gnB3]. They also enable **continuous evaluation**, allowing nurses to track progress, identify gaps, and adjust care to optimize outcomes [^116U7bAA] [^111r1CUM].

## Clinical evidence of impact

| **Clinical area** | **Outcome improvements** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Chronic disease management (diabetes, hypertension) | Improved HbA1c, blood pressure, self-management | High (Cochrane review) [^115feiaN] |
| COPD exacerbations | Reduced hospitalizations and ED visits | High (Cochrane review) [^1159gnB3] |
| Hospital discharge transitions | Reduced 30-day readmissions | Moderate (RCTs, systematic reviews) [^notfound] |
| End-of-life care | Improved goal concordance, reduced family distress | High (RCTs) [^112xCJXV] [^112EP24D] |
| Nutrition support | Improved intake, reduced complications | Moderate (standards, observational studies) [^1156HXki] [^114PjjAT] |

---

## Barriers and facilitators

Barriers include **time constraints**, high workloads, and limited resources, which can reduce plan quality and implementation fidelity [^116tkcPe] [^114TtYnx]. Facilitators include **teamwork**, EHR integration, leadership support, and nurse training, which enhance plan effectiveness and sustainability [^111RbR7s] [^115NCNNU].

---

An RN care plan improves outcomes by delivering **individualized, coordinated, evidence-based care** that engages patients, supports self-management, and enables timely interventions. It is a key driver of quality, safety, and patient satisfaction across settings [^115zbdDy] [^111CaRkT].

### Anticipatory care planning for community-dwelling older adults at risk of functional decline: a feasibility cluster randomized controlled trial [^114qSvRU]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine the feasibility, implementation and outcomes of an Anticipatory Care Planning (ACP) intervention in primary care to assist older adults at risk of functional decline by developing a personalized support plan.

Design

Feasibility cluster randomized control trial.

Setting and participants

Eight primary care practices (four in Northern Ireland, United Kingdom and four in the Republic of Ireland) were randomly assigned to either intervention or control arm. Eligible patients were those identified in each practice as 70 years of age or older and assessed as at risk of functional decline. Study participants (intervention n = 34, control n = 31) and research staff were not blinded to group assignment.

Anticipatory care intervention

The intervention delivered by a registered nurse including: a) a home-based patient assessment; b) care planning on the basis of a holistic patient assessment, and c) documentation of a support plan.

Outcome measures

A conceptual framework (RE-AIM) guided the assessment on the potential impact of the ACP intervention on patient quality of life, mental health, healthcare utilisation, costs, perception of person-centred care, and reduction of potentially inappropriate prescribing. Data were collected at baseline and at 10 weeks and six months following delivery of the intervention.

Results

All pre-specified feasibility indicators were met. Patients were unanimous in the acceptance of the ACP intervention. Health care providers viewed the ACP intervention as feasible to implement in routine clinical practice with attending community supports. While there were no significant differences on the primary outcomes (EQ-5D-5L: -0.07 (-0.17, 0.04) p = .180; CES-D: 1.2 (-2.5, 4.8) p = .468) and most secondary measures, ancillary analysis on social support showed responsiveness to the intervention. Incremental cost analysis revealed a mean reduction in costs of €320 per patient (95% CI -31 to 25; p = 0.82) for intervention relative to the control.

Conclusions

We successfully tested the ACP intervention in primary care settings and have shown that it is feasible to implement. The ACP intervention deserves further testing in a definitive trial to determine whether its implementation would lead to better outcomes or reduced costs.

### A cluster randomised controlled trial of nurse and GP partnership for care of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1174xEbh]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a significant health problem worldwide. This randomised controlled trial aims at testing a new approach that involves a registered nurse working in partnership with patients, general practitioners (GPs) and other health professionals to provide care to patients according to the evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. The aim is to determine the impact of this partnership on the quality of care and patient outcomes.

Methods

A cluster randomised control trial design was chosen for this study. Randomisation occurred at practice level. GPs practising in South Western Sydney, Australia and their COPD patients were recruited for the study.

The intervention was implemented by nurses specifically recruited and trained for this study. Nurses, working in partnership with GPs, developed care plans for patients based on the Australian COPDX guidelines. The aim was to optimise patient management, improve function, prevent deterioration and enhance patient knowledge and skills. Control group patients received 'usual' care from their GPs.

Data collection includes patient demographic profiles and their co-morbidities. Spirometry is being performed to assess patients' COPD status and CO analyser to validate their smoking status. Patients' quality of life and overall health status are being measured by St George's Respiratory Questionnaire and SF-12 respectively. Other patient measures being recorded include health service use, immunisation status, and knowledge of COPD. Qualitative methods will be used to explore participants' satisfaction with the intervention and their opinion about the value of the partnership.

Analysis

Analysis will be by intention to treat. Intra-cluster (practice) correlation coefficients will be determined and published for all primary outcome variables to assist future research. The effect of the intervention on outcomes measured on a continuous scale will be estimated and tested using mixed model analysis of variance in which time and treatment group will be fixed effects and GP practice and subject nested within practice will be random effects. The effect of the intervention on the dichotomous variables (such as smoking status, patient knowledge) will be analysed using generalised estimating equations with a logistic link and a model structure that is analogous to that described above.

### A cluster randomised controlled trial of nurse and GP partnership for care of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116Yf1Jp]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Lesson learnt from a previous study

A randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted in 1998–99 which evaluated the effect of a brief, nurse-led intervention at 1 week and 4 weeks interval after discharge from hospital on clinical outcomes in patients with COPD. The aim was to evaluate the efficacy of limited community based care provided by nurses to COPD patients. Results from this study demonstrated limited success. There were some improvements in activity and knowledge scores of patients in the intervention group and they were more satisfied with their care, but there was no impact on rates of emergency department presentation and hospital readmission. We subsequently attributed the failure of the intervention to three key reasons 1) GPs were not sufficiently involved in the patient care (evident by the fact that only 31% of the GPs recalled having received patient related information (care plan) from the nurses), 2) there was no formal partnership between GPs and nurses streamlining patient care, and 3) the unavailability of universally accepted guidelines for management of COPD such as, COPDX.

Aim of the study

The aim of this study is to test a new approach to improving the care of patients with COPD managed in general practice. The intervention involves a registered nurse with specific training working in partnership with the patient, GPs and other health professionals to provide evidence-based care according to the Australian COPDX guidelines. The research aims to determine the impact of this partnership on the quality of care and health outcomes for patients with COPD at six and 12 months follow-up.

These are the hypotheses being tested:

1. That in patients with COPD, the intervention improves disease-related quality of life and overall health including patient health status, lung function and health service use.

2. That the intervention improves the quality of care provided to patients with COPD and that this will impact on knowledge, immunisation compliance, smoking cessation and satisfaction with care.

Research Plan

A cluster randomised control trial design has been chosen for this study. As GPs find it difficult to selectively offer interventions to their patients, the cluster design was implemented to avoid contamination between intervention and control groups. Randomisation occurred at practice level and an adjustment to the sample size estimates allowed for clustering.

### A team-based approach to providing asthma action plans [^116D8oij]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

National guidelines for treatment of asthma include recommendations for providing written asthma action plans (AAPs) to improve outcomes through patient self-management. However, AAP completion rates remain limited in practice.

Methods

We developed a team-based approach for the delivery of care to asthma patients in a primary care setting that involved integration of an electronic clinical quality management system and provision of written AAPs by registered nurses.

Results

The percentage of patients with AAPs increased after implementation of clinical reminders and nurse-led provision of written AAPs.

Conclusion

Proper training, use of an electronic clinical reminder system, and enhanced engagement of registered nurses can improve AAP completion rates in a team-based primary care setting.

### Quality planning for impactful improvement: a mixed methods review [^1133FtTr]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Conclusion

Quality planning is an important pre-requisite of impactful QI. This review summarises key literature relating to the five important aspects of quality planning (as shown in figure 1), accompanied by practical examples to aid understanding. The quality planning process should involve defining priorities and utilising data-driven decision-making to clarify and understand the issues that are important to patients, service users and staff. In order for QI activity to have the best chance of improving care in a meaningful and sustained way, each of the five aspects discussed above must be considered at the planning stage.

### Clinical pathways for secondary care and the effects on professional practice, patient outcomes, length of stay and hospital costs [^111CaRkT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical pathways (CPWs) are structured multidisciplinary care plans. They aim to translate evidence into practice and optimize clinical outcomes. This is the first update of the previous systematic review.

Objectives

To investigate the effect of CPWs on patient outcomes, length of stay, costs and charges, adherence to recommended practice, and to measure the impact of different approaches to implementation of CPWs.

Search Methods

For this update, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase were searched on 25 July 2024. Two trial registries were searched on 26 July 2024, along with reference checking, citation searching and contacting authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We considered two groups of participants: health professionals involved in CPW utilization, including (but not limited to) physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists, occupational therapists and social workers; and patients managed using a CPW. We included randomized trials, non-randomized trials, controlled before-after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time-series (ITS) studies comparing (1) stand-alone clinical pathways with usual care, and (2) clinical pathways as part of a multifaceted intervention with usual care.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened all titles, abstracts and full-text manuscripts to assess eligibility and the methodological quality of included studies using the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care 'Risk of Bias' tool. Certainty of evidence was assessed by two authors independently. Interventions were scored as 'high', 'moderate' or 'low' for the evidence-based implementation process.

Main Results

The update provided 31 additional studies for a total of 58 included studies (24,841 patients and 2027 healthcare professionals). Forty-one (71%) were randomized trials, four (7%) non-randomized trials, four (7%) CBA studies and nine (16%) ITS studies. Forty-nine studies compared stand-alone CPWs to usual care and nine compared multifaceted interventions including a CPW to usual care. Collectively, the risk of bias was high due to potential contamination by healthcare professionals, lack of blinding of patients and personnel, lack of allocation concealment and selective reporting in ITS studies. Stand-alone clinical pathway interventions It is uncertain whether stand-alone CPWs reduce inhospital mortality (13% v 16%: OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.20; P = 0.27; I² = 65%; 7 randomized trials; n = 4603; low-certainty evidence due to serious imprecision and inconsistency) or mortality (up to 6 months) (4% v 3%: OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.60; P = 0.34; I² = 20%; 3 randomized trials, n = 805; low-certainty evidence due to serious risk of bias and imprecision). Stand-alone CPWs likely reduce inhospital complications (10% v 17%: OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.80; P = 0.001; I² = 52%; 11 randomized trials, n = 3668; moderate-certainty evidence due to serious risk of bias). It is very uncertain whether stand-alone CPWs reduce hospital readmissions (up to 6 months) (9% v 13%: OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.03; P = 0.07; I² = 11%; 9 randomized trials, n = 1578; very low-certainty evidence due to serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision). Stand-alone CPWs likely reduce the length of hospital stay compared to usual care (MD -1.12 days, 95% CI -1.60 to -0.65; P < 0.00001; I² = 64%; 21 studies; n = 5201; moderate-certainty evidence due to serious inconsistency). Costs and charges were generally lower in CPWs as indicated by negative MDs in nine studies (10 studies, n = 2113, data not pooled; very low-certainty evidence due to serious indirectness and very serious inconsistency). Stand-alone CPWs may slightly increase adherence to recommended practice compared with usual care (3 randomized studies, n = 573; data not pooled; low-certainty evidence due to serious risk of bias and serious inconsistency). Multifaceted clinical pathway interventions It is uncertain whether multifaceted CPWs reduce inhospital mortality (2 randomized studies, n = 6304, data not pooled; low-certainty evidence due to very serious inconsistency). Multifaceted CPWs may make little or no difference to mortality (up to 6 months) (9% v 8%: OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.25; P = 0.61; I² = 0%; 3 randomized studies; n = 6531; low-certainty evidence due to serious imprecision and serious risk of bias). It is uncertain whether multifaceted CPWs reduce inhospital complications (9% v 23%: OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.87; 1 study, n = 140; low-certainty evidence due to very serious imprecision). It is uncertain whether multifaceted CPWs reduce hospital readmission (up to 6 months) (2 randomized studies, n = 1569, data not pooled; low-certainty evidence due to very serious inconsistency), or length of stay (4 randomized studies, n = 1936, data not pooled; low-certainty evidence due to very serious inconsistency), or hospital costs and charges (4 randomized studies, n = 2015, data not pooled; very low-certainty evidence due to very serious imprecision and serious indirectness in outcome measures). It is uncertain whether multifaceted CPWs increase adherence to recommended practice (2 randomized studies, n = 6304, data not pooled, low-certainty evidence due to very serious inconsistency). Key study characteristics The highest proportion of included studies were from the USA (36%), followed by Australia (10%), China (10%), Japan (5%), the UK (5%), Canada (5%), Italy (5%), and Germany (5%). More than half of the included studies tested CPW in general acute wards (53%), followed by emergency departments (17%), intensive care (14%), and extended-stay facilities (10%). The most common clinical conditions were asthma (16%), stroke (10%), mechanical ventilation (9%) and myocardial infarction (7%).

Authors' Conclusions

Stand-alone CPWs are likely to reduce inhospital complications and length of hospital stay and may slightly increase adherence to recommended practice. There was little conclusive evidence for multifaceted CPWs due to mixed results from a limited number of included studies. It is uncertain whether stand-alone CPWs or CPWs, as part of a multifaceted approach, reduce inhospital mortality, mortality (up to 6 months), hospital readmission (up to 6 months) or costs and charges.

### Effect of a nurse team coordinator on outcomes for hospitalized medicine patients [^1147n1NT]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Several randomized trials have found that discharge planning improves outcomes for hospitalized patients. We do not know if adding a clinical nurse specialist (CNS) to physician teams in hospitals that already have discharge planning services makes a difference.

Methods

In 2 teaching hospitals, patients were randomly assigned to regular hospital care or care with a clinical nurse specialist. The clinical nurse specialist facilitated hospital care by retrieving preadmission information, arranging in-hospital consultations and investigations, organizing postdischarge follow-up visits, and checking up on patients postdischarge with a telephone call. In-hospital outcomes included mortality and length of stay. Postdischarge outcomes included time to readmission or death, patient satisfaction, and the risk of adverse event. Adverse events were poor outcomes due to medical care rather than the natural history of disease.

Results

A total of 620 sequential patients were randomized (CNS n = 307, control n = 313), of which 361 were followed after discharge from hospital (CNS n = 175, control n = 186). The groups were similar for the probability of in-hospital death (CNS 9.3% vs control 9.7%) or being discharged to the community (58.0% vs 60.0%). The groups did not differ for postdischarge outcomes including readmission or death (21.6% vs 15.6%; P = 0.16) or risk of adverse event (23.6% vs 22.8%). Mean [SD] patient ratings of overall quality of care on a scale of 10 was higher in the clinical nurse specialist group (8.2 [2.2] vs 7.6 [2.4]; P = 0.052).

Conclusion

The addition of a clinical nurse specialist to a medical team improved patient satisfaction but did not impact hospital efficiency or patient safety.

### The strategies to reduce injuries and develop confidence in elders intervention: falls risk factor assessment and management, patient engagement, and nurse Co-management [^1111VXuq]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2017). Low credibility.

In response to the epidemic of falls and serious falls-related injuries in older persons, in 2014, the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the National Institute on Aging funded a pragmatic trial, Strategies to Reduce Injuries and Develop confidence in Elders (STRIDE) to compare the effects of a multifactorial intervention with those of an enhanced usual care intervention. The STRIDE multifactorial intervention consists of five major components that registered nurses deliver in the role of falls care managers, co-managing fall risk in partnership with patients and their primary care providers (PCPs). The components include a standardized assessment of eight modifiable risk factors (medications; postural hypotension; feet and footwear; vision; vitamin D; osteoporosis; home safety; strength, gait, and balance impairment) and the use of protocols and algorithms to generate recommended management of risk factors; explanation of assessment results to the patient (and caregiver when appropriate) using basic motivational interviewing techniques to elicit patient priorities, preferences, and readiness to participate in treatments; co-creation of individualized falls care plans that patients' PCPs review, modify, and approve; implementation of the falls care plan; and ongoing monitoring of response, regularly scheduled re-assessments of fall risk, and revisions of the falls care plan. Custom-designed falls care management software facilitates risk factor assessment, the identification of recommended interventions, clinic note generation, and longitudinal care management. The trial testing the effectiveness of the STRIDE intervention is in progress, with results expected in late 2019.

### Personalised care planning for adults with chronic or long-term health conditions [^115feiaN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Personalised care planning is a collaborative process used in chronic condition management in which patients and clinicians identify and discuss problems caused by or related to the patient's condition, and develop a plan for tackling these. In essence it is a conversation, or series of conversations, in which they jointly agree goals and actions for managing the patient's condition.

Objectives

To assess the effects of personalised care planning for adults with long-term health conditions compared to usual care (i.e. forms of care in which active involvement of patients in treatment and management decisions is not explicitly attempted or achieved).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ProQuest, clinicaltrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to July 2013.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials and cluster-randomised trials involving adults with long-term conditions where the intervention included collaborative (between individual patients and clinicians) goal setting and action planning. We excluded studies where there was little or no opportunity for the patient to have meaningful influence on goal selection, choice of treatment or support package, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two of three review authors independently screened citations for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcomes were effects on physical health, psychological health, subjective health status, and capabilities for self management. Secondary outcomes included effects on health-related behaviours, resource use and costs, and type of intervention. A patient advisory group of people with experience of living with long-term conditions advised on various aspects of the review, including the protocol, selection of outcome measures and emerging findings.

Main Results

We included 19 studies involving a total of 10,856 participants. Twelve of these studies focused on diabetes, three on mental health, one on heart failure, one on end-stage renal disease, one on asthma, and one on various chronic conditions. All 19 studies included components that were intended to support behaviour change among patients, involving either face-to-face or telephone support. All but three of the personalised care planning interventions took place in primary care or community settings; the remaining three were located in hospital clinics. There was some concern about risk of bias for each of the included studies in respect of one or more criteria, usually due to inadequate or unclear descriptions of research methods. Physical healthNine studies measured glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), giving a combined mean difference (MD) between intervention and control of -0.24% (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.35 to -0.14), a small positive effect in favour of personalised care planning compared to usual care (moderate quality evidence). Six studies measured systolic blood pressure, a combined mean difference of -2.64 mm/Hg (95% CI -4.47 to -0.82) favouring personalised care (moderate quality evidence). The pooled results from four studies showed no significant effect on diastolic blood pressure, MD -0.71 mm/Hg (95% CI -2.26 to 0.84). We found no evidence of an effect on cholesterol (LDL-C), standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.01 (95% CI -0.09 to 0.11) (five studies) or body mass index, MD -0.11 (95% CI -0.35 to 0.13) (four studies). A single study of people with asthma reported that personalised care planning led to improvements in lung function and asthma control. Psychological healthSix studies measured depression. We were able to pool results from five of these, giving an SMD of -0.36 (95% CI -0.52 to -0.20), a small effect in favour of personalised care (moderate quality evidence). The remaining study found greater improvement in the control group than the intervention group. Four other studies used a variety of psychological measures that were conceptually different so could not be pooled. Of these, three found greater improvement for the personalised care group than the usual care group and one was too small to detect differences in outcomes. Subjective health statusTen studies used various patient-reported measures of health status (or health-related quality of life), including both generic health status measures and condition-specific ones. We were able to pool data from three studies that used the SF-36 or SF-12, but found no effect on the physical component summary score SMD 0.16 (95% CI -0.05 to 0.38) or the mental component summary score SMD 0.07 (95% CI -0.15 to 0.28) (moderate quality evidence). Of the three other studies that measured generic health status, two found improvements related to personalised care and one did not. Four studies measured condition-specific health status. The combined results showed no difference between the intervention and control groups, SMD -0.01 (95% CI -0.11 to 0.10) (moderate quality evidence). Self-management capabilitiesNine studies looked at the effect of personalised care on self-management capabilities using a variety of outcome measures, but they focused primarily on self efficacy. We were able to pool results from five studies that measured self efficacy, giving a small positive result in favour of personalised care planning: SMD 0.25 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.43) (moderate quality evidence). A further five studies measured other attributes that contribute to self-management capabilities. The results from these were mixed: two studies found evidence of an effect on patient activation, one found an effect on empowerment, and one found improvements in perceived interpersonal support. Other outcomesPooled data from five studies on exercise levels showed no effect due to personalised care planning, but there was a positive effect on people's self-reported ability to carry out self-care activities: SMD 0.35 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.52). We found no evidence of adverse effects due to personalised care planning. The effects of personalised care planning were greater when more stages of the care planning cycle were completed, when contacts between patients and health professionals were more frequent, and when the patient's usual clinician was involved in the process.

Authors' Conclusions

Personalised care planning leads to improvements in certain indicators of physical and psychological health status, and people's capability to self-manage their condition when compared to usual care. The effects are not large, but they appear greater when the intervention is more comprehensive, more intensive, and better integrated into routine care.

### Nursing record systems: effects on nursing practice and healthcare outcomes [^114vR2mS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

A nursing record system is the record of care that was planned or given to individual patients and clients by qualified nurses or other caregivers under the direction of a qualified nurse. Nursing record systems may be an effective way of influencing nurse practice.

Objectives

To assess the effects of nursing record systems on nursing practice and patient outcomes.

Search Strategy

For the original version of this review in 2000, and updates in 2003 and 2008, we searched: the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register; MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, BNI, ISI Web of Knowledge, and ASLIB Index of Theses. We also handsearched: Computers, Informatics, Nursing (Computers in Nursing); Information Technology in Nursing; and the Journal of Nursing Administration. For this update, searches can be considered complete until the end of 2007. We checked reference lists of retrieved articles and other related reviews.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time series comparing one kind of nursing record system with another in hospital, community or primary care settings. The participants were qualified nurses, students or healthcare assistants working under the direction of a qualified nurse, and patients receiving care recorded or planned using nursing record systems.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (in two pairs) independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included nine trials (eight RCTs, one controlled before and after study) involving 1846 people. The studies that evaluated nursing record systems focusing on relatively discrete and focused problems, for example effective pain management in children, empowering pregnant women and parents, reducing loss of notes, reducing time spent on data entry of test results, reducing transcription errors, and reducing the number of pieces of paper in a record, all demonstrated some degree of success in achieving the desired results. Studies of nursing care planning systems and total nurse records demonstrated uncertain or equivocal results.

Authors' Conclusions

We found some limited evidence of effects on practice attributable to changes in record systems. It is clear from the literature that it is possible to set up the randomised trials or other quasi-experimental designs needed to produce evidence for practice. Qualitative nursing research to explore the relationship between practice and information use could be used as a precursor to the design and testing of nursing information systems.

### Nursing record systems: effects on nursing practice and health care outcomes [^111xGJxW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

A nursing record system is the record of care planned and/or given to individual patients/clients by qualified nurses or other caregivers under the direction of a qualified nurse. Nursing record systems may be an effective way of influencing nurse practice.

Objectives

To assess the effects of nursing record systems on nursing practice and patient outcomes.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Library, the EPOC trial register (October 2002), MEDLINE, Cinahl, Sigle, and databases of the Royal College of Nursing, King's Fund, the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, and the Institute of Electrical Engineers up to August 1999; and OCLC First Search, Department of Health database, NHS Register of Computer Applications and the Health Visitors' Association database up to the end of 1995. We hand searched the Journal of Nursing Administration (1971–1999), Computers in Nursing (1984–1999), Information Technology in Nursing (1989–1999) and reference lists of articles. We also hand searched the major health informatics conference proceedings. We contacted experts in the field of nursing informatics, suppliers of nursing computer systems, and relevant Internet groups. To update the review the Medline, Cinahl, British Nursing Index, Aslib Index to Theses databases were all searched from 1998 to 2002. The Journal of Nursing Administration, Computers in Nursing, Information Technology in Nursing were all hand searched up to 2002. The searches of the other databases and grey literature included in the original review, were not updated (except for Health Care Computing Conference and Med Info) as the original searches produced little relevant material.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted time series comparing one kind of nursing record system with another, in hospital, community or primary care settings. The participants were qualified nurses, students or health care assistants working under the direction of a qualified nurse and patients receiving care recorded and/or planned using nursing record systems.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Eight trials involving 1497 people were included. In three studies of client held records, there were no overall positive or negative effects, although some administrative benefits through fewer missing notes were suggested. A paediatric pain management sheet study showed a positive effect on the children's pain intensity. A computerised nursing care planning study showed a negative effect on documented nursing care planning, although two other computerised nursing information studies showed an increase in recording but no change in patient outcomes. Care planning took longer with these computerised systems, but the numbers of patients and nurses included in these studies was small. A controlled before-and-after study of two paper nursing record systems showed improvement in meeting documentation standards.

Reviewer's Conclusions

No evidence was found of effects on practice attributable to changes in record systems. Although there is a paucity of studies of sufficient methodological rigour to yield reliable results in this area, it is clear from the literature that it is possible to set up randomised trials or other quasi-experimental designs needed to produce evidence for practice. The research undertaken so far may have suffered both from methodological problems and faulty hypotheses. Qualitative nursing research to explore the relationship between practice and information use, could be used as a precursor to the design and testing of nursing information systems.

### Impact of geriatric assessment and management on quality of life, unplanned hospitalizations, toxicity, and survival for older adults with cancer: the randomized 5C trial [^114jk2xj]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Intervention

Our standardized GA protocol (Data Supplement) included functional status, mood, cognition, nutritional status, medications, comorbidity, mobility and falls, and social support. - It aligns with the ASCO geriatric oncology guidelinedespite our study being designed before the guideline publication.

The GA was completed at baseline by a registered nurse (RN), geriatric oncology fellow in two centers, and geriatrician (and repeated if deemed clinically necessary) at an appointment time and location convenient for the patient (eg, oncology clinic, treatment center, etc) to avoid extra visits for the patient. Other allied health professionals required a referral. On the basis of the GA results, predefined evidence-based interventions (Data Supplement) that were deemed relevant by the intervention team together with the participant were implemented. For the two hospitals that did not have a geriatrician on site, the RN/oncologist who conducted the GA discussed the results with the geriatric team at the coordinating site to develop the care plan.

The summary GA results were provided on paper to the oncologist within 24 hours, and the detailed GA results and recommendations were communicated to the oncologist and primary care team within 2 business days through a dictated note in the health record, allowing them to use the GA information for treatment decision making. After the GA visit, the RN from the intervention team called the participant at least monthly for 6 months to evaluate the care plan, assess changes in health, functional status, and new symptoms, and consulted with the geriatrician for new recommendations and to decide if a repeat visit with the geriatrician was needed (no formal criteria but on the basis of clinical judgment).

Participants allocated to the control group had access to standard care provided by their oncology team and healthy aging pamphlets. -

Outcomes

The primary outcome was QOL measured with the EORTC QOL Questionnaire core version 30 items (QLQ C30). We chose the global QOL subscale as our primary end point as it is widely used, well validated, and our pilot study suggested clinically meaningful change in this outcome.

Secondary outcomes included the EORTC QLQ C30 summary score, functional status, any grade 3–5 treatment toxicity (including laboratory toxicity), unplanned health care use, overall survival, patient satisfaction, cancer treatment plan modification, and adherence to the intervention (Table 1).

### Impact of a nurse-led advance care planning intervention on satisfaction, health-related quality of life, and health care utilization among patients with severe respiratory disease: a randomized patient-preference trial [^111iskRf]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Previous work has found that facilitated advance care planning (ACP) interventions are effective in increasing ACP uptake among patients with severe respiratory disease.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to investigate whether a nurse-led, facilitated ACP intervention among participants with severe respiratory disease impacts self-reported or clinical outcomes.

Methods

A multicenter, open-label, patient-preference, randomized controlled trial of a nurse-led facilitated ACP intervention was performed. Outcome measures included self-report scales (health care satisfaction and EQ-5D-5L health-related quality of life at three- and six-month follow-up), 12-month mortality, and health care utilization during the final 90 days of life.

Results

One hundred forty-nine participants were recruited across two study settings (metropolitan tertiary hospital respiratory department and rural sites) and 106 were allocated to receive the ACP intervention. There was no effect of the intervention on satisfaction with health care, health-related quality of life, or 12-month mortality rates. Among those participants who died during the follow-up period (N = 54), those allocated to the ACP intervention had significantly fewer outpatient consultations (7.51 vs. 13.6, P < 0.001). There were no changes in emergency department attendances, total hospital admissions or length of stay, or home nursing visits. Among those allocated to the ACP intervention, there was a reduced length of stay in acute hospital settings (7.76 vs. 11.5 nights, P < 0.001) and increased length of stay in palliative hospital settings (5.54 vs. 2.08, P < 0.001) during the final 90 days of life.

Conclusion

A facilitated ACP intervention among patients with severe respiratory disease did not have an impact on satisfaction, health-related quality of life, or 12-month mortality rate. Facilitated ACP may be associated with a different type of health care utilization during the end-of-life period.

### Systematic review of the impact of cancer survivorship care plans on health outcomes and health care delivery [^114KW5WQ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Numerous organizations recommend that patients with cancer receive a survivorship care plan (SCP) comprising a treatment summary and follow-up care plans. Among current barriers to implementation are providers' concerns about the strength of evidence that SCPs improve outcomes. This systematic review evaluates whether delivery of SCPs has a positive impact on health outcomes and health care delivery for cancer survivors. Methods Randomized and nonrandomized studies evaluating patient-reported outcomes, health care use, and disease outcomes after delivery of SCPs were identified by searching MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Cochrane Library. Data extracted by independent raters were summarized on the basis of qualitative synthesis. Results Eleven nonrandomized and 13 randomized studies met inclusion criteria. Variability was evident across studies in cancer types, SCP delivery timing and method, SCP recipients and content, SCP-related counseling, and outcomes assessed. Nonrandomized study findings yielded descriptive information on satisfaction with care and reactions to SCPs. Randomized study findings were generally negative for the most commonly assessed outcomes (ie, physical, functional, and psychological well-being); findings were positive in single studies for other outcomes, including amount of information received, satisfaction with care, and physician implementation of recommended care. Conclusion Existing research provides little evidence that SCPs improve health outcomes and health care delivery. Possible explanations include heterogeneity in study designs and the low likelihood that SCP delivery alone would influence distal outcomes. Findings are limited but more positive for proximal outcomes (eg, information received) and for care delivery, particularly when SCPs are accompanied by counseling to prepare survivors for future clinical encounters. Recommendations for future research include focusing to a greater extent on evaluating ways to ensure SCP recommendations are subsequently acted on as part of ongoing care.

Nutrition support — Standard 3: Nutrition intervention outlines practice indicators across competency levels ("Competent", "Proficient", "Expert") where the "X" signifies the indicators for the level of practice. Indicators include, with clinical privileges, to order adjustments in EN and/or PN formulation; with specialized training and clinical privileges, to place nasogastric or nasoenteric feeding tubes; with clinical privileges, to order adjustments in fluid therapies or electrolyte replacements; and to lead the interdisciplinary team through an analytical decision making process in complicated, unpredictable, and dynamic situations. The standard includes delegation and oversight activities to assign activities to DTR and other administrative support and technical personnel in accordance with qualifications, organization policies, and applicable laws and regulations, and to supervise support personnel (eg, direct care provided to patients/clients; in the collection of laboratory data, intake/output records, and intake analysis). Ongoing care processes include continuing data collection, monitoring and analyzing clinical data to improve patient/client outcomes, responding to clinical data analysis by ordering relevant tests and/or adjusting the frequency of existing test orders consistent with clinical, following up and verifying that nutrition intervention/plan of care is occurring, documenting patient/client progress on the plan of care, identifying barriers to implementation of the plan of care and pursuing strategies to overcome known barriers, and adjusting nutrition intervention/plan of care strategies, if needed, as response occurs. Related actions include revising nutrition support therapy based on observed response to treatment, anticipating and solving future barriers to delivery of the plan and adjusting nutrition support care plan as indicated, and implementing the revised nutrition care plan consistent with best practices and impact on patient/client care. Documentation expectations include date and time, specific treatment goals and expected outcomes, recommended interventions, adjustments to the plan and justification, patient/client/community receptivity, referrals made and resources used, patient/client comprehension, barriers to change, other information relevant to providing care and monitoring progress over time, plans for follow up and frequency of care, and rationale for discharge or referral if applicable.

Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2021). High credibility.

Nutrition support roles for registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs) — In clinical settings, RDNs evaluate nutrition screening results, conduct nutrition assessments with nutrition-focused physical examinations, confer with interprofessional team members, determine plan(s) of care, and provide ongoing monitoring and adjustments; with privileging and/or organization-approved policies and protocols, RDNs place enteral feeding tubes and initiate, implement, and/or adjust protocol- or physician-order driven EN- or PN-related plans. RDNs see patients/clients across all ages and diseases/conditions, and a person-centered approach is critical to care; when varied and complex treatment issues occur, RDNs consider implications of nutrition and hydration, particularly in populations such as those undergoing cancer treatment or receiving palliative or hospice care, and consider the patient/client and/or family/surrogate decision-maker consistent with an advanced directive. The RDN collaborates with an interprofessional team whose core members include a physician(s), pharmacist, and nurse, with other professionals such as physician assistant, nurse practitioner, respiratory therapist, speech language pathologist, and social worker included to meet care goals; an interprofessional approach has been shown to enhance quality of care, improve patient safety and outcomes, and reduce health care costs. RDNs may collaborate with information technology teams to advance personalized nutrition efforts, defined as the use of individual measurable data to affect nutrition status or outcomes, such as continuous glucose monitoring or indirect calorimetry.

### Nurse-led advance care planning with older people who have end-stage kidney disease: feasibility of a deferred entry randomised controlled trial incorporating an economic evaluation and mixed methods process evaluation (ACReDiT) [^112Ko6Px]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Advance Care Planning is recommended for people with end-stage kidney disease but evidence is limited. Robust clinical trials are needed to investigate the impact of advance care planning in this population. There is little available data on cost-effectiveness to guide decision makers in allocating resources for advance care planning. Therefore we sought to determine the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial and to test methods for assessing cost-effectiveness.

Methods

A deferred entry, randomised controlled feasibility trial, incorporating economic and process evaluations, with people with end-stage kidney disease, aged 65 years or older, receiving haemodialysis, in two renal haemodialysis units in Northern Ireland, UK. A nurse facilitator helped the patient make an advance care plan identifying: a surrogate decision-maker; what the participant would like to happen in the future; any advance decision to refuse treatment; preferred place of care at end-of-life.

Results

Recruitment lasted 189 days; intervention and data collection 443 days. Of the 67 patients invited to participate 30 (45%) declined and 36 were randomised to immediate or deferred advance care plan groups. Twenty-two (61%) made an advance care plan and completed data collection at 12 weeks; 17 (47.2%) were able to identify a surrogate willing to be named in the advance care plan document. The intervention was well-received and encouraged end-of-life conversations, but did not succeed in helping patients to fully clarify their values or consider specific treatment choices. There was no significant difference in health system costs between the immediate and deferred groups.

Conclusions

A trial of advance care planning with participants receiving haemodialysis is feasible and acceptable to patients, but challenging. A full trial would require a pool of potential participants five times larger than the number required to complete data collection at 3 months. Widening eligibility criteria to include younger (under 65 years of age) and less frail patients, together with special efforts to engage and retain surrogates may improve recruitment and retention. Traditional advance care planning outcomes may need to be supplemented with those that are defined by patients, helping them to participate with clinicians in making medical decisions.

### Complex advance care planning interventions for chronic serious illness: how do they work: a scoping review [^112t3SXB]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2021). High credibility.

Context

Advance care planning (ACP) interventions have the potential to improve outcomes for patients with chronic serious illness. Yet the rationale for outcome choices and the mechanisms by which outcomes are achieved are not always clear.

Objectives

To identify and map proposed mechanisms on how complex ACP interventions can impact outcomes for patients with chronic serious illness and to explore factors that might explain intervention outcomes.

Methods

This is a scoping review of randomised controlled trials of complex ACP interventions for patients with chronic serious illness which explicitly stated the mechanism(s) by which the intervention was thought to work. We searched six databases and hand-searched key journals and reference lists.

Results

Inclusion yielded 16 articles. Inclusion procedures and mapping of mechanisms and outcomes indicated that causality between components and outcomes was not always clearly described. Tailoring intervention content to patients' needs was linked to the greatest number of different outcome categories, while promoting competence and confidence to engage in ACP was most often explicitly linked to a primary outcome. Three main factors which might have affected intended outcomes were identified: participant characteristics, such as illness experience or cultural differences; the setting of implementation; or methodological limitations of the study.

Conclusion

Findings highlighted two main points of consideration for future ACP intervention studies: the need for clearly stated logic in how interventions are expected to impact primary outcomes and the importance of considering how an intervention may function for patients with chronic serious illnesses within a specific setting.

### The impact of advance care planning on end of life care in elderly patients: randomised controlled trial [^112EP24D]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Implications for clinicians and policy makers

We believe our study highlights several factors that are important for both clinicians and policy makers. Firstly, the focus of advance care planning needs to be on improving communication between patients, their families, and doctors. Although documentation is often completed during the process of advance care planning, documentation alone is unlikely to improve outcomes. Secondly, advance care planning needs to be a coordinated approach involving the various members of the patient's treating health providers, including a trained advance care planning facilitator. Furthermore, advance care planning needs to become a part of usual care, and mechanisms need to be in place to ensure that it is offered to patients. Finally, successful advance care planning requires a change in systems to ensure that it occurs, the plans are readily available, and the care a person receives reflects their wishes. Health services need to develop policy around advance care planning and end of life care.

Conclusions

A coordinated, systematic model of patient centred advance care planning using non-medical advance care planning facilitators assists in identifying and respecting patient's wishes about end of life care, improves such care from the perspective of the patient and the family, and diminishes the likelihood of stress, anxiety, and depression in surviving relatives.

### The impact of advance care planning on end of life care in elderly patients: randomised controlled trial [^114oehAw]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Since the 1990s there has been an increasing awareness of the inadequacy of end of life care and of the poor knowledge of patients' wishes about their medical treatment at a time when they lose the capacity to make decisions, resulting in patients being cared for in a way they would not have chosen. This has continued to the present day. Apart from progress in palliative care, the main focus to deal with these needs has been the development of advance care planning. Advance care planning is a process "whereby a patient, in consultation with health care providers, family members and important others, makes decisions about his or her future health care, should he or she become incapable of participating in medical treatment decisions". The process of advance care planning informs and empowers patients to have a say about their current and future treatment. Advance care planning and the importance of improving end of life care are both supported by legislation in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and are endorsed by professional bodies, including the Australian, British, and Americanmedical associations.

Elements of advance care planning include clarifying a patient's understanding of their illness and treatment options; understanding their values, beliefs, and goals of care; and identifying their wishes. If required a substitute decision maker (surrogate) is nominated. The potential barriers to advance care planning include the availability of trained staff with the time, competence, and confidence to discuss advance care planning with patients; organisational commitment and policy to support advance care planning; and ensuring that doctors understand and support advance care planning. Carrying out effective advance care planning in elderly patients is challenging, especially when they are acutely unwell and have a short length of stay in hospital before discharge.

Much of the focus on advance care planning has been on improving the completion rate of advance directives. Such improvement does not necessarily improve medical careor end of life care. Models of advance care planning such as the Respecting Choices programme have shown that a coordinated, systematic, patient centred approach to advance care planning by trained non-medical facilitators can improve outcomes for patients. Evidence also shows that advance care planning and end of life discussions reduce stress, anxiety, and depression in surviving relatives.

Indicators further specify evaluating evidence that the nutrition intervention/plan of care is influencing a desirable change in the patient/client behavior or status by incorporating patient/client-specific evidence from multiple areas to determine the status of established goals and outcomes, identifying positive or negative outcomes, and supporting conclusions with evidence, including using evidence-based standards to evaluate patient/client outcomes such as the Academy EAL for critical illness and/or the Society of Critical Care Medicine [SCCM]/A.S.P.E.N.

Advance care planning (ACP) has shown benefit in some, but not all, studies. It is important to understand the utility of ACP. We conducted a scoping review to identify promising interventions and outcomes.

Design

Scoping review.

Measurements

We searched MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Web of Science for ACP randomized controlled trials from January 1, 2010, to March 3, 2020. We used standardized Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses methods to chart study characteristics, including a standardized ACP Outcome Framework: Process (e.g., readiness), Action (e.g., communication), Quality of Care (e.g., satisfaction), Health Status (e.g., anxiety), and Healthcare Utilization. Differences between arms of P < .05 were deemed positive.

Results

Of 1,464 articles, 69 met eligibility; 94% were rated high quality. There were variable definitions, age criteria (≥ 18 to ≥ 80years), diseases (e.g., dementia and cancer), and settings (e.g., outpatient and inpatient). Interventions included facilitated discussions (42%), video only (20%), interactive, multimedia (17%), written only (12%), and clinician training (9%). For written only, 75% of primary outcomes were positive, as were 69% for multimedia programs; 67% for facilitated discussions, 59% for video only, and 57% for clinician training. Overall, 72% of Process and 86% of Action outcomes were positive. For Quality of Care, 88% of outcomes were positive for patient-surrogate/clinician congruence, 100% for patients/surrogate/clinician satisfaction with communication, and 75% for surrogate satisfaction with patients' care, but not for goal concordance. For Health Status outcomes, 100% were positive for reducing surrogate/clinician distress, but not for patient quality of life. Healthcare Utilization data were mixed.

Conclusion

ACP is complex, and trial characteristics were heterogeneous. Outcomes for all ACP interventions were predominantly positive, as were Process and Action outcomes. Although some Quality of Care and Health Status outcomes were mixed, increased patient/surrogate satisfaction with communication and care and decreased surrogate/clinician distress were positive. Further research is needed to appropriately tailor interventions and outcomes for local contexts, set appropriate expectations of ACP outcomes, and standardize across studies.

### Impact of a transition nurse program on the prevention of thirty-day hospital readmissions of elderly patients discharged from short-stay units: study protocol of the PROUST stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial [^114syEju]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion of the intervention

The intervention tested herein may be referred to as a bridging intervention because it is carried out both before and after patients leave the hospital. However, this type of intervention is not precisely defined, in particular with respect to the duration of follow-up after hospitalisation and to its components. Indeed, the literature reviews have pointed out the heterogeneous nature of the interventions tested (combining up to eight different actions), the populations studied, and the assessment criteria measured. They have also pointed out an inadequate description of how the intervention unfolds, and the absence of data regarding the context of the implementation that could explain the success or failure of the intervention in question.

Our program takes its inspiration from interventions using a TN that have shown a significant reduction in unscheduled hospital readmission and/or emergency visit rates in randomised controlled trials in geriatrics. Five studies identified in the literature reviews met the above criteria and were available when our protocol was developed.

In these five studies, the nurse was usually an advanced practice nurse. The nurse's intervention was centred on the hospitalised patient, on health care professionals in and out of hospital, or on both. When the intervention targeted the patient, the primary roles of the TN were to encourage the patient and caregiver to assert a more active role during care transitions, to provide continuity across settings, and to ensure that the patient's needs were being met irrespective of the care setting. A personal health record (PHR) was used as a tool to engage patients in self-care. When the intervention targeted the professionals, the nurse developed an individualized discharge plan with the patient, health professionals, family, and caregivers. A summary of the discharge plan was distributed to the patient, primary care physician, and other health care team members who would care for the patient at home. When both professionals and the patient were targeted by the intervention, the development of a discharge plan was accompanied by patient and caregiver education in order to increase their ability to manage unresolved health problems once at home. The interventions began upon admission to hospital and were continued for 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, or 6 months after hospitalisation. In two studies, the TN was partnered with a physiotherapist or a pharmacist. The most frequent action carried out by the TN was related to medications. Some data do indeed suggest that medication reconciliation should be a part of interventions aiming to reduce the risk of rehospitalisation.

### Evaluating survivorship care plans: results of a randomized, clinical trial of patients with breast cancer [^116PQgNd]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

An Institute of Medicine report recommends that patients with cancer receive a survivorship care plan (SCP). The trial objective was to determine if an SCP for breast cancer survivors improves patient-reported outcomes.

Patients and Methods

Women with early-stage breast cancer who completed primary treatment at least 3 months previously were eligible. Consenting patients were allocated within two strata: less than 24 months and ≥ 24 months since diagnosis. All patients were transferred to their own primary care physician (PCP) for follow-up. In addition to a discharge visit, the intervention group received an SCP, which was reviewed during a 30-minute educational session with a nurse, and their PCP received the SCP and guideline on follow-up. The primary outcome was cancer-related distress at 12 months, assessed by the Impact of Event Scale (IES). Secondary outcomes included quality of life, patient satisfaction, continuity/coordination of care, and health service measures.

Results

Overall, 408 survivors were enrolled through nine tertiary cancer centers. There were no differences between groups on cancer-related distress or on any of the patient-reported secondary outcomes, and there were no differences when the two strata were analyzed separately. More patients in the intervention than control group correctly identify their PCP as primarily responsible for follow-up (98.7% v 89.1%; difference, 9.6%; 95% CI, 3.9 to 15.9; P = 0.005).

Conclusion

The results do not support the hypothesis that SCPs are beneficial for improving patient-reported outcomes. Transferring follow-up to PCPs is considered an important strategy to meet the demand for scarce oncology resources. SCPs were no better than a standard discharge visit with the oncologist to facilitate transfer.

### Impact of a transition nurse program on the prevention of thirty-day hospital readmissions of elderly patients discharged from short-stay units: study protocol of the PROUST stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial [^113a2n57]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In France, for patients aged 75 or older, it has been estimated that the hospital readmission rate within 30 days is 14%, a quarter being avoidable. Some evidence suggests that interventions "bridging" the transition from hospital to home and involving a designated professional (usually nurses) are the most effective in reducing the risk of readmission, but the level of evidence of current studies is low. Our study aims to assess the impact of a care transition program from hospital to home for elderly admitted to short-stay units.

Methods

This is a multicentre, stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial. The program will be implemented at three times of the transition: 1) during the patient's stay in hospital: development of a discharge plan, creation of a transitional care file, and notification of the primary care physician about inpatient care and hospital discharge by the transition nurse; 2) on the day of discharge: meeting between the transition nurse and the patient to review the follow-up recommendations; and 3) for 4 weeks after discharge: follow-up by the transition nurse. The primary outcome is the 30-day unscheduled hospital readmission or emergency visit rate after the index hospital discharge. The patients enrolled will be aged 75 or older, hospitalized in an acute care geriatric unit, and at risk of hospital readmission or an emergency visit after returning home. In all, 630 patients will be included over a 14-month period. Data analysis will be blinded to allocation, but due to the nature of the intervention, physicians and patients will not be blinded.

Discussion

Our study makes it possible to evaluate the specific effect of a bridging intervention involving a designated professional intervening before, during, and after hospital discharge. The strengths of the study design are methodological and practical. It permits the estimation of the intervention effect using between- and within-cluster comparisons; the study of the fluctuations in unscheduled hospital readmission or emergency visit rates; the participation of all clusters in the intervention condition; the implementation of the intervention in each cluster successively.

Trial Registration

This study has been registered as a cRCT at clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: NCT02421133). Registered 9 March 2015.

### Nursing research priorities in critical care, pulmonary, and sleep: international Delphi survey of nurses, patients, and caregivers [^112oCXBf]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2020). High credibility.

Adult respiratory health nursing research priorities — patient-reported experience emphasize quitting smoking; how patients and families/caregivers make decisions about health; the burden of having more than one illness; patients' and families'/caregivers' health beliefs and how they think, understand, learn, and remember; how they get, process, and understand health information to arrive at a decision; what families/caregivers understand about patient needs and about the progression or prognosis of lung disease; living with uncertainty after diagnosis; creating an advanced-care plan; motivators for self-care; preparing for loss; how families/caregivers can be helped to better understand what patients are experiencing; being diagnosed with a lung disease and accepting the diagnosis; the amount of social support and its impact; how scientific evidence and patients' and families'/caregivers' values, preferences, and needs relate to health behaviors; experiences of good and poor communication with the health care team; the role of patients and patient associations in therapeutic education and caregiver support; and the impact of families on outcomes in lung disease.

### Contextual factors influencing advance care planning in home care: process evaluation of the cluster-randomised controlled trial STADPLAN [^116gX9u2]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The STADPLAN study is a cluster-randomised controlled trial including 27 home care services in Germany. It assesses the effect of an advance care planning (ACP) intervention delivered by trained nurses to older care-dependent patients. Patients received two ACP conversations and an information brochure. Nurses were educated through a two-day programme and topic guides structuring the conversations. Objectives of the process evaluation were to determine: [1] whether the intervention was implemented as planned, [2] which change mechanisms were observed, [3] whether targeted process outcomes were achieved and [4] in which way contextual factors influenced the implementation process.

Methods

The process evaluation is based on a mixed methods approach following the recommendations of the UK-MRC framework for the development and evaluation of complex interventions. Qualitative and quantitative assessments were developed and analysed guided by a logic model comprising intervention, participants, mechanisms of change and context factors. The results of the main trial will be published elsewhere.

Results

Educational programme and topic guides were mostly implemented as planned and resulted in motivation, knowledge, and perceived competencies to facilitate ACP conversations in nurses. Deviances in the performance of ACP conversations indicated patients' varied individual needs, but also obstacles like reluctance of patients and caregivers to participate actively and time constraints of nurse facilitators. Patients and caregivers reported increased awareness of ACP, planning and other activities indicating that targeted process outcomes could be achieved. The relevance of multifaceted contextual factors acting as barriers or facilitators for the engagement in ACP interventions on the individual, organisational and macro level was evident.

Conclusions

The process evaluation elicits obstacles and achievements of the ACP intervention. The logic model organised a plethora of mixed methods data into a holistic picture of multifaceted results. Nurses as ACP facilitators in home care can fulfil a crucial initiating role based on a trusting relationship with their patients. To support older care-dependent people's ACP engagement, access should be simplified. Furthermore, education for nurse facilitators and sufficient resources for service provision are needed. Independent of monetary reimbursement, healthcare providers must respect patients' choice for or against any ACP intervention.

### Person-centered, goal-oriented care helped my patients improve their quality of life [^112nqk6Q]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

When the goal is to help patients improve their quality of life, it makes sense to focus directly on the activities and relationships that are most important to each patient. This can be accomplished most effectively by following a three-step process that includes 1) connecting with the patient around what matters to them, 2) co-creating a goal-oriented plan, and 3) collaborating with patient, family, team members, and consultants to increase the probability of success. Once this approach has been mastered and the necessary systems, processes, and relationships are in place, this should not take more time than a problem-oriented approach, and it will almost certainly be more satisfying for both physician and patient. The impact on population-based quality metrics is uncertain. Though fewer patients may choose to follow standard recommendations, those who do may be more likely to adhere to them.

### Standards of practice for nutrition support nurses [^114PjjAT]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2007). Medium credibility.

Standard 3: Planning — The NSN may participate in the development of an individualized nutrition care plan (NCP), and this should be done in collaboration with other healthcare professionals and the patient or caregiver(s). The NCP is based on the results of the patient's nutrition assessment, clinical condition and expected outcomes, is derived from the synthesis of patient-specific assessment data, as well as evidence-based literature, and the optimal NCP provides appropriate, economic, and resource-efficient care. The NCP shall be age- and culturally-appropriate and in accordance with current guidelines. For measurement, the NCP should support the medical care plan and the patient's clinical condition, and is congruent with established organizational policies, procedures, and protocols. The NSN may document the goals of the NCP, and the documentation should include immediate and long-term goals of nutrition therapy, including transitional feeding; appropriate route of nutrition administration; duration of therapy; nutrition support therapy formulation; monitoring parameters in response to nutrition support therapy; discharge planning; and patient/caregiver education.

### The impact of advance care planning on end of life care in elderly patients: randomised controlled trial [^112xCJXV]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective To investigate the impact of advance care planning on end of life care in elderly patients.

Design Prospective randomised controlled trial.

Setting Single centre study in a university hospital in Melbourne, Australia.

Participants 309 legally competent medical inpatients aged 80 or more and followed for six months or until death.

Interventions Participants were randomised to receive usual care or usual care plus facilitated advance care planning. Advance care planning aimed to assist patients to reflect on their goals, values, and beliefs; to consider future medical treatment preferences; to appoint a surrogate; and to document their wishes.

Main outcome measures The primary outcome was whether a patient's end of life wishes were known and respected. Other outcomes included patient and family satisfaction with hospital stay and levels of stress, anxiety, and depression in relatives of patients who died.

Results 154 of the 309 patients were randomised to advance care planning, 125 (81%) received advance care planning, and 108 (84%) expressed wishes or appointed a surrogate, or both. Of the 56 patients who died by six months, end of life wishes were much more likely to be known and followed in the intervention group (25/29, 86%) compared with the control group (8/27, 30%; P < 0.001). In the intervention group, family members of patients who died had significantly less stress (intervention 5, control 15; P < 0.001), anxiety (intervention 0, control 3; P = 0.02), and depression (intervention 0, control 5; P = 0.002) than those of the control patients. Patient and family satisfaction was higher in the intervention group.

Conclusions Advance care planning improves end of life care and patient and family satisfaction and reduces stress, anxiety, and depression in surviving relatives.

### Person-centered care: a definition and essential elements [^115zbdDy]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016). Medium credibility.

Person-centered care — additional characteristics for effective implementation emphasize communication centered on person–provider interactions guided by an up-to-date care plan and accurate understanding of motivations and preferences, with discussions that set specific, measurable, realistic goals and education to achieve and periodically reevaluate them; team-based care is critical and requires organizational support with flexible team composition; coordination requires explicit efforts during transitions, clearly defined responsibility for the care plan, communication across settings, and simultaneous access to care plans; the environment should provide organizational culture, support, and training for person-centered care; and measurement should focus on patient and caregiver satisfaction while also capturing system-level, process, and individual-level outcomes such as mental health, caregiver strain, satisfaction with decision-making role, alignment of goals with received care, and goal attainment scaling.

### Impact of organizational context on patient outcomes in a proactive primary care program: a longitudinal observational study [^114zgybe]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study explored the impact of general practices characteristics on daily functioning, hospital admissions, ER visits and GP out-of-hours consultations in a complex proactive primary care program. We observed that 1) the delivery of the UPROFIT 2.0 program by a district nurse compared to a practice nurse was associated with a higher level of dependency in daily functioning, 2) when the choice was made to screen potential frail older people within the UPROFIT 2.0 program from the age of 75 compared to the choice of screening from the age of 60 years, a significant higher odds on ER visits was observed, 3) if the UPROFIT 2.0 program was implemented 3 years ago compared to 9 years ago, this was significantly associated with fewer GP out-of-hours consultations.

The delivery of the UPROFIT 2.0 program by a district nurse compared to a practice nurse was associated with a higher level of dependency on daily functioning. In clinical practice, there is variation in the type of patient to whom the different nurses deliver care. Practice nurses generally provide care to older people with chronic conditions, while district nurses provide care to older people with complex and multiple care needs with IADL and ADL impact. The association we identified in this study may reflect the normal variation in patient outcomes. Older people receiving care from district nurses are less likely to improve on patient outcomes than older people who only visit their practice nurse. In this light, the choice to deliver the UPROFIT 2.0 program by either a practice nurse or a district nurse should may be not be made on practice level but patient level. However, more research, preferably of qualitative nature, is recommended to unravel how coordination of care planning ends up with the practice or district nurse and what the (dis)advantages are in care delivering.

### Stakeholder perspectives on the optimizing patient transfers, impacting medical quality, and improving symptoms: transforming institutional care (OPTIMISTIC) project [^112WPHwq]. The Gerontologist (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The need to reduce burdensome and costly hospitalizations of frail nursing home residents is well documented. The Optimizing Patient Transfers, Impacting Medical Quality, and Improving Symptoms: Transforming Institutional Care (OPTIMISTIC) project achieved this reduction through a multicomponent collaborative care model. We conducted an implementation-focused project evaluation to describe stakeholders' perspectives on (a) the most and least effective components of the intervention; (b) barriers to implementation; and (c) program features that promoted its adoption.

Research Design and Methods

Nineteen nursing homes participated in OPTIMISTIC. We conducted semistructured, qualitative interviews with 63 stakeholders: 23 nursing home staff and leaders, 4 primary care providers, 10 family members, and 26 OPTIMISTIC clinical staff. We used directed content analysis to analyze the data.

Results

We found universal endorsement of the value of in-depth advance care planning (ACP) discussions in reducing hospitalizations and improving care. Similarly, all stakeholder groups emphasized that nursing home access to specially trained, project registered nurses (RNs) and nurse practitioners (NPs) with time to focus on ACP, comprehensive resident assessment, and staff education was particularly valuable in identifying residents' goals for care. Challenges to implementation included inadequately trained facility staff and resistance to changing practice. In addition, the program sometimes failed to communicate its goals and activities clearly, leaving facilities uncertain about the OPTIMISTIC clinical staff's roles in the facilities.

Discussion and Implications

These findings are important for dissemination efforts related to the OPTIMISTIC care model and may be applicable to other innovations in nursing homes.

### Effects of unit census and patient acuity levels on discussions during patient rounds [^1152RiT6]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

This research is an important first step to understanding the impact that time discussing essential topics has on the quality of patient care. For instance, given that high acuity patients are associated with acute hospital mortality, is it maladaptive to reduce discussion of acute clinical status updates for these patients when census is high? Does a shared understanding of the care plan weaken amongst providers if discussion durations decrease for low acuity patients, and if so, does this negatively impact patient outcomes as the literature suggests? Future research should investigate how these adaptations and other contextual factors (e.g. interruptions, family engagement) impact the quality of bedside rounds and patient outcomes. These findings will help inform the need for, and development of, interventions that are tailored to efficient rounding practices in varying contexts.

Study limitations include: lack of assessment of rounding adaptations on patient outcomes; the Hawthorne effect; single site with a self-imposed rounding target (90 min) and shorter patient encounters compared with those reported in literature (,–); and variability across attendings leading rounds may have impacted discussion durations.

### Interprofessional collaboration to improve professional practice and healthcare outcomes [^115VAUPX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Poor interprofessional collaboration (IPC) can adversely affect the delivery of health services and patient care. Interventions that address IPC problems have the potential to improve professional practice and healthcare outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the impact of practice-based interventions designed to improve interprofessional collaboration (IPC) amongst health and social care professionals, compared to usual care or to an alternative intervention, on at least one of the following primary outcomes: patient health outcomes, clinical process or efficiency outcomes or secondary outcomes (collaborative behaviour).

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2015, issue 11), MEDLINE, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to November 2015. We handsearched relevant interprofessional journals to November 2015, and reviewed the reference lists of the included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials of practice-based IPC interventions involving health and social care professionals compared to usual care or to an alternative intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of each potentially relevant study. We extracted data from the included studies and assessed the risk of bias of each study. We were unable to perform a meta-analysis of study outcomes, given the small number of included studies and their heterogeneity in clinical settings, interventions and outcomes. Consequently, we summarised the study data and presented the results in a narrative format to report study methods, outcomes, impact and certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included nine studies in total (6540 participants); six cluster-randomised trials and three individual randomised trials (1 study randomised clinicians, 1 randomised patients, and 1 randomised clinicians and patients). All studies were conducted in high-income countries (Australia, Belgium, Sweden, UK and USA) across primary, secondary, tertiary and community care settings and had a follow-up of up to 12 months. Eight studies compared an IPC intervention with usual care and evaluated the effects of different practice-based IPC interventions: externally facilitated interprofessional activities (e.g. team action planning; 4 studies), interprofessional rounds (2 studies), interprofessional meetings (1 study), and interprofessional checklists (1 study). One study compared one type of interprofessional meeting with another type of interprofessional meeting. We assessed four studies to be at high risk of attrition bias and an equal number of studies to be at high risk of detection bias. For studies comparing an IPC intervention with usual care, functional status in stroke patients may be slightly improved by externally facilitated interprofessional activities (1 study, 464 participants, low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether patient-assessed quality of care (1 study, 1185 participants), continuity of care (1 study, 464 participants) or collaborative working (4 studies, 1936 participants) are improved by externally facilitated interprofessional activities, as we graded the evidence as very low-certainty for these outcomes. Healthcare professionals' adherence to recommended practices may be slightly improved with externally facilitated interprofessional activities or interprofessional meetings (3 studies, 2576 participants, low certainty evidence). The use of healthcare resources may be slightly improved by externally facilitated interprofessional activities, interprofessional checklists and rounds (4 studies, 1679 participants, low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported on patient mortality, morbidity or complication rates. Compared to multidisciplinary audio conferencing, multidisciplinary video conferencing may reduce the average length of treatment and may reduce the number of multidisciplinary conferences needed per patient and the patient length of stay. There was little or no difference between these interventions in the number of communications between health professionals (1 study, 100 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Given that the certainty of evidence from the included studies was judged to be low to very low, there is not sufficient evidence to draw clear conclusions on the effects of IPC interventions. Neverthess, due to the difficulties health professionals encounter when collaborating in clinical practice, it is encouraging that research on the number of interventions to improve IPC has increased since this review was last updated. While this field is developing, further rigorous, mixed-method studies are required. Future studies should focus on longer acclimatisation periods before evaluating newly implemented IPC interventions, and use longer follow-up to generate a more informed understanding of the effects of IPC on clinical practice.

### Impact of a transition nurse program on the prevention of thirty-day hospital readmissions of elderly patients discharged from short-stay units: study protocol of the PROUST stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial [^1146Q7eX]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In France, for patients aged 75 or older, it has been estimated that the hospital readmission rate within 30 days is 14%, a quarter being avoidable. Some evidence suggests that interventions "bridging" the transition from hospital to home and involving a designated professional (usually nurses) are the most effective in reducing the risk of readmission, but the level of evidence of current studies is low. Our study aims to assess the impact of a care transition program from hospital to home for elderly admitted to short-stay units.

Methods

This is a multicentre, stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial.

The program will be implemented at three times of the transition: 1) during the patient's stay in hospital: development of a discharge plan, creation of a transitional care file, and notification of the primary care physician about inpatient care and hospital discharge by the transition nurse; 2) on the day of discharge: meeting between the transition nurse and the patient to review the follow-up recommendations; and 3) for 4 weeks after discharge: follow-up by the transition nurse.

The primary outcome is the 30-day unscheduled hospital readmission or emergency visit rate after the index hospital discharge.

The patients enrolled will be aged 75 or older, hospitalized in an acute care geriatric unit, and at risk of hospital readmission or an emergency visit after returning home.

In all, 630 patients will be included over a 14-month period. Data analysis will be blinded to allocation, but due to the nature of the intervention, physicians and patients will not be blinded.

Discussion

Our study makes it possible to evaluate the specific effect of a bridging intervention involving a designated professional intervening before, during, and after hospital discharge.

The strengths of the study design are methodological and practical. It permits the estimation of the intervention effect using between- and within-cluster comparisons; the study of the fluctuations in unscheduled hospital readmission or emergency visit rates; the participation of all clusters in the intervention condition; the implementation of the intervention in each cluster successively.

### What clinicians and researchers should know about the evolving field of advance care planning: a narrative review [^115NCNNU]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Advance care planning (ACP) has been recognized as crucial by patients, families, and clinicians; however, different definitions and measurements have led to inconsistencies in practice and mixed evidence in the literature. This narrative review explores ACP's evolution, innovations, and outcomes using thematic analysis to synthesize data from randomized controlled trials, reviews, and editorials. Key findings include (1) ACP has evolved over the past several decades from a sole focus on code status and advance directive (AD) forms to a continuum of care planning over the life course focused on tailored preparation for patients and surrogate decision-makers and (2) ACP measurement has evolved from traditional outcome metrics, such as AD completion, to a comprehensive outcomes framework that includes behavior change theory, systems, implementation science, and a focus on surrogate outcomes. Since the recent development of an ACP consensus definition and outcomes framework, high-quality trials have reported mainly positive outcomes for interventions, especially for surrogates, which aligns with the patient desire to relieve decision-making burden for loved ones. Additionally, measurement of "clinically meaningful" ACP information, including documented goals of care discussions, is increasingly being integrated into electronic health records (EHR), and emerging, real-time assessments and natural language processing are enhancing ACP evaluation. To make things easier for patients, families, and care teams, clinicians and researchers can use and disseminate these evolved definitions; provide patients validated, easy-to-use tools that prime patients for conversations and decrease health disparities; use easy-to-access clinician training and simple scripts for interdisciplinary team members; and document patients' values and preferences in the medical record to capture clinically meaningful ACP so this information is available at the point of care. Future efforts should focus on efficient implementation, expanded reimbursement options, and seamless integration of EHR documentation to ensure ACP's continued evolution to better serve patients and their care partners.

### Nurse staffing and inpatient mortality in the english national health service: a retrospective longitudinal study [^1113E4s8]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2023). High credibility.

While these studies provide some insight into how human capital impacts patient outcomes, they are at the patient level and do not focus explicitly on the role of team production. As such, they do not directly examine the effect of the nursing team composition, and do not focus on how different combinations of nurses, with different levels of general or firm-specific capital impact team performance (as measured by patient outcomes). This limits the applicability of the results in two ways. First, previous papers have not distinguished between RNs of different levels of seniority, nor between staff who are directly employed by the hospital and those on agency contracts. Second, nurse staffing is planned in advance at the team level, whereas most existing studies are at the patient or hospital level and often use staffing measures that are only available after the fact (such as nurse-reported staffing levels or care hours per patient). This limits their applicability for understanding how the make-up of the nursing teams impacts patient outcomes and for improving workforce planning by managers.

In order to optimise, managers need to understand the relative improvements in patient outcomes that come from adding a less qualified individual or one less familiar with the hospital/ward compared with a more qualified individual with greater ward-specific and team-specific experience. To address this gap, this paper provides the results of a retrospective panel study which links existing routine data from electronic staff rosters (ESRs) and patient records to examine the impact of nursing team size and composition on patient mortality in the hospital setting.

### The care planning umbrella: the evolution of advance care planning [^111egfrQ]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). Medium credibility.

THE INCLUSION OF DIVERSE COMMUNITIES AND EXPERTS

Care planning implementation requires a broad range of community partners that extends well beyond the healthcare setting to where people live in their communities. As others have shown, community outreach and patient- or community-facing implementation strategies are needed, in addition to training clinicians for goals of care conversations. Future efforts to define care planning and appropriate outcomes will need to include representatives from diverse communities, interdisciplinary clinicians (e.g. nurses, social workers, chaplains, healthcare navigators) and other experts (e.g. community health workers, faith-based and community leaders, attorneys).

### Using the recommended summary plan for emergency care and treatment (ReSPECT) in a community setting: does it facilitate best interests decision-making? [^111Qfpn2]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the UK, healthcare professionals have a legal obligation to make decisions about a person's medical treatment and care when that person lacks capacity, and where there is no proxy decision-maker. These decision-makers are legally and morally obligated to act in the person's best interests. Deciding what is in someone's best interests can be challenging, and includes taking into account their medical needs, range of treatment options, the likely benefits and burdens of treatment and what the person's views and wishes regarding treatment might be if they were able to articulate them. While there is considerable academic debate about the meaning of best interests, the predominant position in many healthcare systems prioritises or emphasises the importance of the patient's wishes and feelings, and thus patient autonomy, in best interests decision-making. Recent commentaries on UK Court of Protection decisions suggest an increasing focus on prioritising the patient's wishes and feelings in determining best interests.

In an emergency, or when someone's clinical condition is rapidly deteriorating, decisions often need to be made with limited information, particularly regarding the person's wishes and preferences. The development of emergency care treatment plans (ECTPs) reflects attempts to address this challenge by recording specific treatment recommendations for future anticipated clinical scenarios informed by prior discussion with the patient (or someone close to the patient if the patient lacks capacity). In the USA, a model of ECTP, Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST), is now used in most states; however, there is some concern its widespread use may curtail person-centred decision-making, contrary to its intended aim.

In the UK, The Recommended Summary Plan for Emergency Care and Treatment (ReSPECT) is a widely used ECTP, launched in 2016 by the Resuscitation Council UK. ReSPECT is conceptualised as a shared decision-making process, which emphasises a conversation between a clinician (usually a doctor or a senior nurse) and a patient (or, if the patient lacks capacity, someone close to them), to explore treatment options that reflect what is clinically possible and aligns with the patient's values. The clinician records conversation outcomes on the ReSPECT form with specific free-text recommendations about future treatment, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The ReSPECT form is designed to be patient-held and transition with the patient across health and care settings (see figures 1 and 2).

### The impact of advance care planning on end of life care in elderly patients: randomised controlled trial [^1145Jzw3]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Intervention

Intervention patients received formal advance care planning from a trained facilitator (nurse or allied health worker) using the Respecting Patient Choices model(see web extra on bmj.com). This programme, developed at the Austin Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, is based on the Respecting Choices programmeand involves a coordinated approach to advance care planning whereby trained non-medical facilitators, in collaboration with treating doctors, assist patients and their families to reflect on the patient's goals, values, and beliefs, and to discuss and document their future choices about health care. Patients are encouraged to appoint a surrogate and to document their wishes about end of life care, including the wish for life prolonging treatments and cardiopulmonary resuscitation recorded on an advance care plan. As needed, treating doctors participated in this discussion to ensure that the patients understood their illness, treatment options, and likely prognosis. This programme utilises relevant legislationby enabling appointment of legal surrogates, and ensures a systematic approach to filing of completed documents in hospital medical records so that they are readily available.

Patients were encouraged to include their families, particularly their nominated surrogates, in discussions. The aim was to complete advance care planning before hospital discharge. Consistent with usual practice, control patients received usual medical care but no advance care planning, unless it was specifically requested.

Study assessments

Data collected at enrolment included age, sex, admission diagnosis, the existence of a form requesting no resuscitation, whether the patient had a surrogate, and whether the patient already had any wishes on end of life care, including life prolonging treatment or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. At or immediately after hospital discharge the patient or the family member (if the patient had died) completed a discharge questionnaire. Patients were also contacted by telephone at three and six months after enrolment. If the patient was unreachable, the family member was telephoned. If the patient had died within six months of study enrolment, the family member was interviewed at about three months after the date of death about the quality of death and compliance with known end of life wishes. The family member also completed a quality of end of life care questionnaire, an impact of events scale, and the hospital anxiety and depression scale. The same researcher (KMD) administered the questionnaires in person or by telephone; she did not facilitate advance care planning and was unaware of patient allocation.

### Action plans with brief patient education for exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1159gnB3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a major driver of decline in health status and impose high costs on healthcare systems. Action plans offer a form of self-management that can be delivered in the outpatient setting to help individuals recognise and initiate early treatment for exacerbations, thereby reducing their impact.

Objectives

To compare effects of an action plan for COPD exacerbations provided with a single short patient education component and without a comprehensive self-management programme versus usual care. Primary outcomes were healthcare utilisation, mortality and medication use. Secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life, psychological morbidity, lung function and cost-effectiveness.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register along with CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and clinical trials registers. Searches are current to November 2015. We handsearched bibliographic lists and contacted study authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-RCTs comparing use of an action plan versus usual care for patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD. We permitted inclusion of a single short education component that would allow individualisation of action plans according to management needs and symptoms of people with COPD, as well as ongoing support directed at use of the action plan.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. For meta-analyses, we subgrouped studies via phone call follow-up directed at facilitating use of the action plan.

Main Results

This updated review includes two additional studies (and 976 additional participants), for a total of seven parallel-group RCTs and 1550 participants, 66% of whom were male. Participants' mean age was 68 years and was similar among studies. Airflow obstruction was moderately severe in three studies and severe in four studies; mean post bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) was 54% predicted, and 27% of participants were current smokers. Four studies prepared individualised action plans, one study an oral plan and two studies standard written action plans. All studies provided short educational input on COPD, and two studies supplied ongoing support for action plan use. Follow-up was 12 months in four studies and six months in three studies. When compared with usual care, an action plan with phone call follow-up significantly reduced the combined rate of hospitalisations and emergency department (ED) visits for COPD over 12 months in one study with 743 participants (rate ratio (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.79; high-quality evidence), but the rate of hospitalisations alone in this study failed to achieve statistical significance (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.01; moderate-quality evidence). Over 12 months, action plans significantly decreased the likelihood of hospital admission (odds ratio (OR) 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.97; n = 897; two RCTs; moderate-quality evidence; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 19 (11 to 201)) and the likelihood of an ED visit (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.78; n = 897; two RCTs; moderate-quality evidence; NNTB over 12 months 12 (9 to 26)) compared with usual care. Results showed no significant difference in all-cause mortality during 12 months (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.31; n = 1134; four RCTs; moderate-quality evidence due to wide confidence interval). Over 12 months, use of oral corticosteroids was increased with action plans compared with usual care (mean difference (MD) 0.74 courses, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.35; n = 200; two RCTs; moderate-quality evidence), and the cumulative prednisolone dose was significantly higher (MD 779.0 mg, 95% CI 533.2 to 10248; n = 743; one RCT; high-quality evidence). Use of antibiotics was greater in the intervention group than in the usual care group (subgrouped by phone call follow-up) over 12 months (MD 2.3 courses, 95% CI 1.8 to 2.7; n = 943; three RCTs; moderate-quality evidence). Subgroup analysis by ongoing support for action plan use was limited; review authors noted no subgroup differences in the likelihood of hospital admission or ED visits or all-cause mortality over 12 months. Antibiotic use over 12 months showed a significant difference between subgroups in studies without and with ongoing support. Overall quality of life score on St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) showed a small improvement with action plans compared with usual care over 12 months (MD -2.8, 95% CI -0.8 to -4.8; n = 1009; three RCTs; moderate-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence showed no benefit for psychological morbidity as measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).

Authors' Conclusions

Use of COPD exacerbation action plans with a single short educational component along with ongoing support directed at use of the action plan, but without a comprehensive self-management programme, reduces in-hospital healthcare utilisation and increases treatment of COPD exacerbations with corticosteroids and antibiotics. Use of COPD action plans in this context is unlikely to increase or decrease mortality. Whether additional benefit is derived from periodic ongoing support directed at use of an action plan cannot be determined from the results of this review.

### Survivorship care plans in cancer: a systematic review of care plan outcomes [^113Dm17U]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

SCP development and introduction

Several different models of SCP delivery were evaluated. All SCPs were developed by the treatment team. Some were delivered to the patient by an oncologist during a normal follow-up visit and others were delivered during a specialised educational consultation with a specialist nurse. Three were sent by mail, either to the patient or primary-care physician, and one was a web-based SCP with log-in details sent to patient and primary-care physician.

All SCPs were developed using standardised templates. One study used the American Society of Clinical Oncology SCP template, one the LiveStrong SCP template (and Livestrong Foundation Livestrong Care Plan), one adapted the Institute of Medicine template and the remaining studies developed their own template for use in the study and/or for routine institutional use.

### Advance care planning with patients who have end-stage kidney disease: a systematic realist review [^1148FYbs]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2018). Low credibility.

Unpicking the program theories in relation to how advance care planning could be successfully implemented, and identifying contexts that may help or hinder, has allowed us to synthesize an integrated theory to explain and support implementation. Unsurprisingly, the first stage is staff training. However, it is important to note the focus of the training — to address staff concerns, clarify processes, and optimize skills — and its goal — to persuade staff of the usefulness of advance care planning and to give them confidence to start discussions with patients and their relatives. Training is less likely to be effective if it takes for granted the usefulness of advance care planning, marginalizes staff concerns, and does not engender confidence in the process.

Similarly, when addressing the second stage of implementation (the approach to the patient and relatives), the focus and goal of the approach are key ingredients for success. The advance care planning document and approach should be culturally appropriate, actively involve the surrogate, explore the patient's understanding of their condition, and elicit and document their values and preferences for care. The goal is for the patient (and their surrogate) to trust staff sufficiently that they are able to share their values and beliefs and gain confidence to enter into discussions with clinicians. The few detailed reports of advance care planning interventions largely described relatively short (e.g. one hour) guided interactions between the patient, their surrogate, and a trained facilitator, helping the patient and surrogate to clarify values and develop skills related to initiating discussions, preparing for decision-making, and leading to a document recording patient preferences. One hour is not a long time to spend making a plan for one's care in the event of deterioration, but it is significant in terms of professional time when there are competing priorities. This introduces the impact of context. In organizational terms, the umbrella concept is that advance care planning should be core business. That is, it should attract support in the form of policy, administrative processes, resources (funded training, staffing levels), quality assurance, and accountability. Advance care planning that is an "add-on" is likely to be swamped by the pressures of routine care. Interestingly, only two studies directly addressed organizational issues: one that reported training nurses to offer advance care planning in the context of a supportive policy framework of educative, patient information, safety, and quality systems; and the other examining the effectiveness of an electronic medical record–based reminder in improving advance directive documentation. The vast majority of studies focused on patient-staff interaction in relative isolation from the organizational context.

### A targeted literature review on the impact of tailored interventions on patient outcomes in oncology [^1139iXvd]. Oncogene (2025). Medium credibility.

It is not possible to consider the future directions of healthcare strategies and resource use without considering the growing and increasingly essential role played by machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) tools in all fields of medicine. Early research has suggested that novel data visualization techniques and unsupervised machine learning may help predict the safety profile of cancer treatments, allowing greater anticipation and management of side effects, including side effects which may frequently cluster both in terms of severity and temporally. In addition, AI tools may be able to predict those patients most likely to experience adverse events, allowing targeting of resources to those patients who are more likely to gain the most benefit from a given intervention. Furthermore, AI techniques could be used to dynamically adapt the level of engagement for each patient based initially on baseline patient characteristics, and then subsequently on dynamic patient information following treatment initiation. This approach may allow for real-time tailoring of the non-pharmacological interventions according to patient needs, without considerable investment of HCP time, and further highlights the potential for adaptive personalization of tailored interventions in clinical practice. The use of AI in the ways described would be likely to have a substantial impact on health system efficiency and the practical management of clinical practice.

Other technological advances are likely to assist healthcare professionals in managing side effects according to individual patient needs and characteristics. The emergence of apps such as "Patient knows best" allows patients to see their own medical records and care plans, and provides patients with greater autonomy over their own data. However, reports suggest that providing this level of information without further context or support can lead to confusion and anxiety among patients who may not fully understand the data available to them. Combining this approach with tailored interventions in the form of one-to-one nurse reviews or plain language summaries may increase the effectiveness of apps such as "Patient knows best", allowing patients to benefit from increased data transparency in a positive and constructive way while avoiding any unnecessary anxiety due to a lack of understanding.

### The impact of advance care planning on end of life care in elderly patients: randomised controlled trial [^112b6xGp]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Four of these five key elements were absent from the SUPPORT study, a project that relied on a research nurse to relay information verbally to the treating doctor about a patient's preference for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but which did not facilitate patient centred discussions, involve the patient's surrogate, and ensure that the treating doctor was aware of the patient's advance care plan when end of life decisions were made.

Legislation supports doctors following a patient's wishes, even if the patient wants to limit treatment. Although statutory law in Australiasupports the legal appointment of surrogates, it is common law that recognises the right of competent adults to refuse medical treatment. Thus common law provides the main legal support for the ethical principle of patient autonomy and the concept of advance care planning.

### Anticipatory care planning for community-dwelling older adults at risk of functional decline: a feasibility cluster randomized controlled trial [^111TdqJu]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Outcomes and data collection

The RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) framework guided our approach to evaluating the ACP intervention. Four of the five parameters of the framework apply to this study. A fifth, maintenance, was not considered as it examines integration into routine practice post-implementation.

Quantitative evaluation of reach and effectiveness: Quantification of r each concerned characteristics of the study sample and their representativeness. Baseline variables included demographics such as age, gender, education, living arrangements, income, and economic resources.

Effectiveness pertained to the primary and secondary outcomes of the trial. Patients in the trial participated in standardised individual interviews at baseline, ten weeks, six months post intervention, with six months being the primary outcome time point. These interviews were conducted by researchers, not the interventionist nurses.

Measurement criteria specify that the NSN may participate in evaluation of new products and equipment used in the nutrition care process, should participate in the development of organizational policies and procedures designed to provide interdisciplinary and cost-effective nutrition care, shall delegate tasks to other healthcare professionals according to competency and validations of their skill and knowledge base, and may act as a liaison to identify and secure resources to ensure an appropriate level of nutrition care is provided for patients.

### 'Care left undone' during nursing shifts: associations with workload and perceived quality of care [^116tkcPe]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

There is strong evidence to show that lower nurse staffing levels in hospitals are associated with worse patient outcomes. One hypothesised mechanism is the omission of necessary nursing care caused by time pressure-'missed care'.

Aim

To examine the nature and prevalence of care left undone by nurses in English National Health Service hospitals and to assess whether the number of missed care episodes is associated with nurse staffing levels and nurse ratings of the quality of nursing care and patient safety environment.

Methods

Cross-sectional survey of 2917 registered nurses working in 401 general medical/surgical wards in 46 general acute National Health Service hospitals in England.

Results

Most nurses (86%) reported that one or more care activity had been left undone due to lack of time on their last shift. Most frequently left undone were: comforting or talking with patients (66%), educating patients (52%) and developing/updating nursing care plans (47%). The number of patients per registered nurse was significantly associated with the incidence of 'missed care' (p < 0.001). A mean of 7.8 activities per shift were left undone on wards that are rated as 'failing' on patient safety, compared with 2.4 where patient safety was rated as 'excellent' (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Nurses working in English hospitals report that care is frequently left undone. Care not being delivered may be the reason low nurse staffing levels adversely affects quality and safety. Hospitals could use a nurse-rated assessment of 'missed care' as an early warning measure to identify wards with inadequate nurse staffing.

### Hospital nurse staffing models and patient and staff-related outcomes [^112wUADB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Nurse staffing interventions have been introduced across countries in recent years in response to changing patient requirements, developments in patient care, and shortages of qualified nursing staff. These include changes in skill mix, grade mix or qualification mix, staffing levels, nursing shifts or nurses' work patterns. Nurse staffing has been closely linked to patient outcomes, organisational outcomes such as costs, and staff-related outcomes.

Objectives

Our aim was to explore the effect of hospital nurse staffing models on patient and staff-related outcomes.

Search Strategy

We searched the following databases from inception through to May 2009: Cochrane/EPOC resources (DARE, CENTRAL, the EPOC Specialised Register), PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, CAB Health, Virginia Henderson International Nursing Library, the Joanna Briggs Institute database, the British Library, international theses databases, as well as generic search engines.

Selection Criteria

Randomised control trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted time series analyses of interventions relating to hospital nurse staffing models. Participants were patients and nursing staff working in hospital settings. We included any objective measure of patient or staff-related outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Seven reviewers working in pairs independently extracted data from each potentially relevant study and assessed risk of bias.

Main Results

We identified 6,202 studies that were potentially relevant to our review. Following detailed examination of each study, we included 15 studies in the review. Despite the number of studies conducted on this topic, the quality of evidence overall was very limited. We found no evidence that the addition of specialist nurses to nursing staff reduces patient death rates, attendance at the emergency department, or readmission rates, but it is likely to result in shorter patient hospital stays, and reductions in pressure ulcers. The evidence in relation to the impact of replacing Registered Nurses with unqualified nursing assistants on patient outcomes is very limited. However, it is suggested that specialist support staff, such as dietary assistants, may have an important impact on patient outcomes. Self-scheduling and primary nursing may reduce staff turnover. The introduction of team midwifery (versus standard care) may reduce medical procedures in labour and result in a shorter length of stay without compromising maternal or perinatal safety. We found no eligible studies of educational interventions, grade mix interventions, or staffing levels and therefore we are unable to draw conclusions in relation to these interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings suggest interventions relating to hospital nurse staffing models may improve some patient outcomes, particularly the addition of specialist nursing and specialist support roles to the nursing workforce. Interventions relating to hospital nurse staffing models may also improve staff-related outcomes, particularly the introduction of primary nursing and self-scheduling. However, these findings should be treated with extreme caution due to the limited evidence available from the research conducted to date.

### Improving comparative effectiveness research of complex health interventions: standards from the patient-centered outcomes research institute (PCORI) [^115ysRnM]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Plan and Describe a Process Evaluation

Some complex health interventions may have relatively small impacts on the outcomes experienced by patients. It is thereby important to learn whether the measured outcomes are due to relatively low impact of the intended core functions or rather that the intended core functions were not actually achieved. Distinguishing between these two alternative explanations is important when interpreting studies evaluating CHIs. The fourth standard addresses this need by advising investigators to plan and conduct a process evaluation to determine whether and how an intervention achieved its intended effects. Process evaluations provide key information about the expected impact and mechanisms of effect of a complex health intervention. They can inform future researchers' and decision-makers' efforts to reproduce and tailor the intervention and apply the results to their own settings and patient populations. Process evaluations can also help elucidate how an intervention's effectiveness may be altered by the setting and contextual factors and therefore help explain differences between expected and observed outcomes.

An essential feature of a process evaluation is to identify measurable intermediate outcomes that are related to achievement of the intervention's stated core functions. The causal pathway (which provides the rationale for the core functions) should drive the identification of process questions and data collection. A process evaluation needs to be carefully planned and scoped, to target data collection narrowly and to minimize participant burden.

Interpretation of process findings can be enhanced by further information about the ways in which the functions were carried out. This involves how the CHI is implemented and its alignment with what was originally planned in the study's protocol. The fourth standard requires investigators to measure and report the fidelity of delivery, adaptations (planned and unplanned), and dose or quantity of the CHI forms or activities. Measuring and reporting how a participant responds to and interacts with a CHI (i.e. mechanisms of effect) may identify causal mechanisms that had not previously been recognized. Furthermore, failure to achieve an intervention's core functions can sometimes be plausibly attributed to contextual factors, which should be considered when determining what process-related data to collect.

### Effect of a home-based palliative care program on healthcare use and costs [^113K4NTG]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016). Low credibility.

Program Description

Transitions is a concurrent care home‐based program designed for individuals with advanced chronic illness who would benefit from support provided by a trained specialty PC team comprising doctors, nurses, spiritual care providers, and social workers. The Transitions program has four components: in‐home medical consultation, ongoing evidence‐based prognostication of further survival, caregiver support, and advance healthcare planning. The team provides pain and nonpain symptom management, education to promote individual and family awareness of illness trajectory and treatment choices, and psychosocial and spiritual support.

In this concurrent care approach, PC is added to traditional disease‐focused care. The program has acute and maintenance phases. In the acute phase, a registered nurse helps the individual and family to develop structured medical goals, and a social worker helps them to develop a structured list of caregiver and family goals. During the acute phase, individuals receive four to six weekly home visits from the registered nurses, one to three home visits from the social workers, and home visits from spiritual care provider if needed. 12 When the identified goals have been achieved, individuals move into the maintenance phase, in which they continue to receive home visits, although usually less frequently, supplemented with scheduled telephone calls for case management. All staff are trained in PC and aim to address advanced illness and end‐of‐life needs. The palliative physician role is primarily supervisory, with infrequent need for physicians to visit individuals' homes. Chaplain services are provided when requested.

Individuals are identified through primary care providers, specialists, case managers, home health, or Sharp Extended Care (skilled nursing care program) staff using general and disease‐specific criteria. There are no automated triggers, but referring providers are encouraged to use a wide range of assessments before referral, such as assessment of functional abilities, disease‐specific and general laboratory results (e.g. best compensated N‐terminal pro brain‐type natriuretic peptide, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine), and the question, "Would you be surprised if the patient started to use the hospital to manage their direct disease issues?" Thus, referrals depend upon established providers' prognostic tendencies, their relationships with their patients, and their understanding of the Transitions program. When identified by case managers or hospitalists as appropriate for Transitions, the individual's primary care provider must also agree to the referral because he or she will need to sign orders for the individual. The program mandates that Transitions participants continue to see their primary care provider and specialists as needed.

### European Society of Intensive Care Medicine guidelines on end of life and palliative care in the intensive care unit [^115Z58JY]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In critically ill patients receiving LSTs, does formal re-evaluation of these therapies in relation to the patient's evolving condition, prognosis, and achievable goals impact outcomes?

Outcomes

ICU and hospital lengths of stay.
Utilization of intensive-care interventions.
Alignment of care with patient's goals.
Triggers for palliative care delivery.
Proportionality of ICU treatments.
Clinicians' perceptions of excessive care.

Background

Few data exist on how intensivists make decisions about continuing or limiting LSTs. When the response to initial treatments is minimal and the prognostic scores intermediate, making the decisions that avoid non-beneficial interventions is particularly difficult. A time-limited trial (TLT) can help. The trial plan and duration should be agreed upon by the intensivists and patients and/or families. At the end of the trial, the appropriateness of continuing or limiting LSTs is assessed. Other methods can be used.

Summary of the evidence

Eight observational descriptive studies specifically evaluated TLTs. In addition, one before-after quality-improvement study assessed the impact of an early family conference. An intervention that was designed to improve communication and involved both ICU HCPs and relatives used a TLT for care planning. The intervention improved the quality of family meetings, shortened ICU stays, and decreased treatment intensity and duration in patients less likely to benefit from aggressive management.

Discussion

The available data do not support any specific protocol about foregoing LST. No strong evidence exists that formal LST re-appraisal after a TLT is beneficial. Nonetheless, the experts agree that such a re-appraisal may benefit patients and families. There is some evidence supporting a multi-disciplinary approach, the involvement of patients or relatives in formal discussions with ICU HCPs, and the use of communication aids to enhance comprehension. RCTs are needed to assess whether a formal LST re-appraisal strategy affects patient, family, and HCP outcomes.

### Proactive and integrated primary care for frail older people: design and methodological challenges of the utrecht primary care PROactive frailty intervention trial (U-PROFIT) [^116ewy3m]. BMC Geriatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Step 1. Frailty assessment

The level of frailty in patients at risk selected by U-PRIM will be further explored with the Groningen Frailty Indicator questionnaire (GFI). The GFI is a 15-item validated questionnaire that assesses frailty from a functional ADL/IADL perspective on four domains: physical, cognitive, social and psychological. Scores on each item are zero or one, and the total score ranges from 0 (not frail) to 15 (severely frail). We chose a score of 4 or higher as the relevant cut-off for the selection of patients that should be visited for a comprehensive geriatric assessment. The GFI has shown high internal consistency and construct validity. This questionnaire will be sent to all patients selected by U-PRIM.

The INTERMED for the Elderly (IM-E) and the Groningen Wellbeing Indicator (GWI) are additional assessments included in U-CARE to enable a multidimensional approach and to measure patients' needs and complexity of care among frail patients on the GFI.

Step 2. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment at home (CGA)

For those patients identified as being frail, a CGA at home is conducted by a registered practice nurse. During this home visit, the practice nurse focuses on patients' health problems and needs in a structured manner based on the outcome of the frailty assessment. Based on the literature and their prevalence, ten health problems in older patients with additional assessments are included in the CGA (see Additional file 3).

Step 3. Tailor-made care plan

In collaboration with the GP, the practice nurse will prepare a tailor-made care plan based on the outcome of step 2. This tailor-made care plan consists of interventions derived from evidence-based care plans developed by the research team, practice nurses and experts. For all ten health problems assessed in the CGA, separate evidence-based care plans are developed. The use of the care plan ensures uniformity among practice nurses in tailoring and delivering interventions per health problem. Flowcharts with suggested (nursing) interventions per health problem are developed as a practical tool and will help to guide the practice nurses through a structured process of decision making.

### Roles and responsibilities of registered nurses in the early recognition and management of sepsis in acute hospital settings: a scoping review [^112sH8Ae]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Defining actions and capabilities of nurses in sepsis care

The studies included in this review reported a wide range of nursing roles responsible for sepsis care. However, the impact of nursing contributions to sepsis care and patient outcomes cannot be fully assessed until specific role actions are clearly defined and linked to measurable indicators or outcomes. Further work is needed to explore the benefits of developing and implementing nursing roles dedicated to the management of sepsis, defining the capabilities required and the scope of nurses' practice. Furthermore, clear role definition can support multidisciplinary sepsis care and collaboration, appropriate utilisation of team skills and capabilities to enhance patient safety.

Nursing roles described in the included studies lacked detail about what additional training was undertaken or required to enable them to deliver timely, evidence-informed sepsis care. Only one studyprovided this information, describing a dedicated sepsis RN role that required a minimum of 1 year working as an ED nurse and comprehensive onsite training (provided by the organisation) in the management of patients with sepsis and septic shock. Overall, data available demonstrated a lack of consistency relating to the actions undertaken by nurses, hampering the opportunity to robustly evaluate the impact and contribution of nurses providing sepsis care.

Future research

Mapping extracted data from the papers to the AACTT framework has identified several opportunities for future studies investigating the contribution of RNs to sepsis care:

What skills and capabilities do nurses need to deliver patient-centred, safe, evidence-informed sepsis care?
What are nurse-sensitive indicators of effective sepsis care?
What are nurse-sensitive outcomes for early recognition and management of sepsis?
What are system-level indicators of effective nursing sepsis care?

### Impact of regionalized care on concordance of plan and preventable adverse events on general medicine services [^115nakJM]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Dispersion of inpatient care teams across different medical units impedes effective team communication, potentially leading to adverse events (AEs).

Objective

To regionalize 3 inpatient general medical teams to nursing units and examine the association with communication and preventable AEs.

Design

Pre-post cohort analysis.

Setting

A 700-bed academic medical center.

Patients

General medicine patients on any of the participating nursing units before and after implementation of regionalized care.

Intervention

Regionalizing 3 general medical physician teams to 3 corresponding nursing units.

Measurements

Concordance of patient care plan between nurse and intern, and adjusted odds of preventable AEs.

Results

Of the 414 included nurse and intern paired surveys, there were no significant differences pre- versus postregionalization in total mean concordance scores (0.65 vs 0.67, P = 0.26), but there was significant improvement in agreement on expected discharge date (0.56 vs 0.68, P = 0.003), knowledge of the other provider's name (0.56 vs 0.86, P < 0.001), and daily care plan discussions (0.73 vs 0.88, P < 0.001). Of the 392 reviewed patient medical records, there was no significant difference in the adjusted odds of preventable AEs pre- versus postregionalization (adjusted odds ratio: 1.37, 95% confidence interval: 0.69, 2.69).

Conclusions

We found that regionalization of care teams improved recognition of care team members, discussion of daily care plan, and agreement on estimated discharge date, but did not significantly improve nurse and physician concordance of the care plan or reduce the odds of preventable AEs. Our findings suggest that regionalization alone may be insufficient to effectively promote communication and lead to patient safety improvements.

### Can checklists solve our ward round woes? A systematic review [^117YDm25]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The nine included studies were heterogenous in study design, interventions used, and outcomes measured. All studies used paper-based notes/checklists. There was a high risk of bias in the included studies. While each study used a unique checklist intervention, eight common outcomes were measured in four or more studies. Despite the positive trend of improved documentation, only one study described the impact on patient outcomes, where errors in prescription, antibiotic use, fluid balance, patient observations, and the number of diagnosed VTE cases were reduced with the use of a checklist. Few studies assessed the effect of ward round checklists on patient outcomes, these include improved patient-perceived quality of care as well as reduced errors in prescription. From this review, the authors were unable to determine which individual items on the checklist had an impact on patient outcomes. As the primary function of the ward round is to create and set in motion plans for patients, it would be of importance that details regarding management plans are accurately documented. Future studies could be designed to investigate if checklists have an impact on the documentation of management plans and whether this documentation affects patient outcomes. Although the study population targeted doctors conducting ward rounds for surgical inpatients, the consistency of teams or individual doctors was described in only 1/9 studies, which reduces the strength of the results.

### American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition and Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: revised 2014 standards of practice and standards of professional performance for registered dietitian nutritionists (competent, proficient, and expert) in nutrition support [^115sPBEr]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2014). Medium credibility.

Standard 3: Nutrition Intervention states that the registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) "identifies and implements appropriate, purposefully planned interventions designed with the intent of changing a nutrition-related behavior, risk factor, environmental condition or aspect of health status for an individual, target group, or the community at large". The rationale notes that "Nutrition intervention is the third of four steps of the nutrition care process" and "consists of two interrelated components – planning and implementation", with implementation including "carrying out and communicating the intervention/plan of care, continuing data collection, and revising the nutrition intervention/plan of care strategy, as warranted, based on the patient/client response". It further specifies that "A RDN implements the interventions or delegates/assigns components of nutrition intervention/plan of care to support staff in accordance with applicable laws and regulations" and that "Nutrition intervention/plan of care is ultimately the responsibility of the RDN". Indicators for this standard specify that the RDN "Prioritizes the nutrition diagnosis(es) based on problem severity, safety, patient/client needs, likelihood that nutrition intervention/plan of care will influence problem and patient/client perception of importance", with prioritization considerations including "Severity of nutrition risk or malnutrition", "Presence of co-morbid diseases or conditions", "Actual or risk of acute complications", and "Anticipation of delayed/late effects of therapy (eg metabolic abnormalities, catheter infection)". Additional indicators are that the RDN "Bases intervention/plan of care on best available research/evidence, evidence-based guidelines (eg, Academy Evidence Analysis Library [EAL], American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition [A.S.P.E.N.]), and best practices", "Refers to policies and program standards", and "Confers with patient/clients, caregivers, interdisciplinary team, and other healthcare professionals", with the table clarifying that "The 'X' signifies the indicators for the level of practice".

### The effect of advance care planning on heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114n7jp7]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Regardless of therapeutic advances, heart failure remains an unpredictable, progressive and ultimately fatal long-term condition. Existing therapies delay, but generally tend not to reverse disease progression. Consequently, the prevalence of symptomatic heart failure has increased, including a prolongation of the refractory phase of the disease. An ageing population, a rising prevalence and new life-prolonging treatment approaches mean that over 5% of patients suffering from heart failure have developed treatment refractory symptoms. There is widespread recognition that these patients merit support from specialist supportive and palliative care services. –

Advance care planning (ACP) is widely advocated to improve quality of life and patient satisfaction with end-of-life care in heart failure and a reduction of stress and depression in surviving relatives. ACP is defined as a voluntary process of discussion between healthcare professionals, patients, family and important others to identify patient's preferences if the patient may lack the competence to make such decisions in the future. ACP can be a chance for patients to describe what they want to happen and what they do not want to happen in the future. For example, ACP supports patients by clarifying their resuscitation preferences in case of a cardiac arrest, whether or not or under what circumstances to disable an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), choosing a healthcare proxy, deciding on their preferred place of care or making decisions on artificial hydration. ACP can take the shape of a structured discussion or result in the documentation of care preferences in medical records that are regularly reviewed and updated. The context of ACP can be a nurse or consultant-led heart failure outpatient clinic, during inpatient care, or in the course of an appointment with a primary care clinician.

### Protocol for a randomised controlled trial of an outreach support program for family carers of older people discharged from hospital [^114CRHGg]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Study objectives are to:
Compare family carer preparedness to care between those included in the FECH program and those receiving usual care.
Compare patient outcomes from the FECH program versus those from usual care in terms of re-presentations to Emergency Departments (EDs), readmissions to hospital within the months (at least 3) following the index separation date – also Length of Stay (LoS) if readmission does eventuate.
Document costs of a suitably qualified nurse (FECH nurse) implementing the program to inform the economic evaluation and determine a sustainable full time FECH nurse 'caseload'.
Compare costs of re-presentations to EDs, hospital readmissions, and LoS between the intervention group (FECH program) and the control group (usual care).
Estimate overall cost effectiveness for the local health system from FECH program implementation during the study period.
Explore and describe family carers' perceptions of how the FECH program impacts upon caregiving sustainability plus any other outcomes for them; also how it might be refined to (a) minimise any negative outcomes, (b) enhance those that are positive, and (c) (further) enhance caregiving sustainability.
Explore and describe patients' perceptions of how the FECH program impacts upon them and how it might be refined to ensure the best possible outcomes (for them).
Use process evaluation and obtain perspectives of MAU health care professionals to determine how the FECH program's implementation might be improved.
Refine the program from study recommendations and develop a plan to embed it into practice in the study setting and other similar health services.
Develop a plan for testing the FECH program in other health settings – should it be shown to have cost benefits and no negative patient/carer outcomes when implemented in the MAU.

### Person-centered care: a definition and essential elements [^113Jc7v8]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016). Medium credibility.

Person-centered care essential elements — realizing the definition involves an individualized, goal-oriented care plan based on the person's preferences supported by a thorough medical, functional, and social assessment, and for some people, the assessment should be conducted in their place of residence; ongoing review of the person's goals and care plan with reassessment on a regular basis; care supported by an interprofessional team in which the person is an integral team member, and the team must be flexible in composition and adaptable to changes; one primary or lead point of contact on the healthcare team, with one care provider serving as a point of contact to ease communication and facilitate continuity and transitions; active coordination among all healthcare and supportive service providers so services continue as seamlessly as possible, particularly when moving from one site of care (or residence) to another; continual information sharing and integrated communication, which may be accomplished through mechanisms such as the electronic health record and enhanced by careful listening and open communication between the person and everyone involved in his or her care; education and training for providers and, when appropriate, the person and those important to the person, including principles that contribute to consistent recognition and maintenance of the person's autonomy, and health education that supports informed decision-making and self-determination; and performance measurement and quality improvement using feedback from the person and caregivers, where measurable outcomes should focus on successful implementation of care plans, evidence that the person's goals are being met, and efforts to minimize difficulties during transitions between healthcare providers and across care settings.

### The care planning umbrella: the evolution of advance care planning [^115Hadko]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

ACP has evolved over the past several decades to a continuum of care planning focused on preparing people and their surrogate decision-makers for communication and medical decision-making, and it is still evolving. To get to the next level of ACP for clinical care and research, we must reconceptualize care planning as a holistic, ongoing process over the life course that includes both tailored in-the-moment and advanced decisions at every life stage. We suggest the need for a systems-level approach using evidenced-based methods of implementation science and human factors engineering and the inclusion of diverse communities and interdisciplinary experts to develop and evaluate processes to support the continuum of care planning in real-world settings.

### Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of extended nursing roles in dementia care: results of the cluster-randomized trial inDePendent [^113ECmXx]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Studies have revealed that extended nursing roles can yield comparable or superior patient and health system‐level outcomes. Collaborative dementia care programs, often delivered by specially trained nurses, are typically based on the redistribution of tasks and the integration of extended nursing roles. These programs aim to improve post‐diagnostic support and coordinate treatment and care in close cooperation with the general practitioner and have been successfully implemented in several countries. Collaborative dementia care management programs are defined as interventions that coordinate individualized, guideline‐based care for PlwD and their caregivers in primary care settings. Delivered by qualified nurses, dementia care management interventions typically include structured needs assessments, medication management, caregiver support, interdisciplinary care planning, and care coordination. Meta‐analyses and previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that dementia care management programs can reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms, improve caregiver burden and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), delay institutionalization, and increase anti‐dementia drug prescription rates. However, evidence concerning the efficiency and cost‐effectiveness of extended nursing roles is limited and remains heterogeneous.

This analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy and cost‐effectiveness of a dementia care model with extended nursing roles in an outpatient setting of physician networks in Germany compared to usual care, focusing on patient, caregiver, and health system‐relevant outcomes.

### Person-centered care: a definition and essential elements [^114TtYnx]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016). Medium credibility.

Person-centered care — barriers to implementation include inconsistent terminology that limits system-wide delivery and cross-study work; persistence of traditional principal decision-maker roles; physician workload that necessitates interprofessional team support; misaligned incentives where those bearing costs may not benefit; unclear quality indicators where a person-centered care plan may be most significant; provider concerns when risky patient choices raise ethical and medico-legal issues; lack of advance care planning, especially in dementia; fragmented payment structures across healthcare and community-based services; and lack of interoperable health records that hinders coordination.

### Identifying the implementation conditions associated with positive outcomes in a successful nursing facility demonstration project [^111WMKx3]. The Gerontologist (2020). Medium credibility.

There is a growing focus on reducing potentially avoidable hospitalizations of nursing facility residents to improve the quality of care and reduce costs. In 2012, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a call for enhanced care coordination demonstration projects to reduce potentially avoidable hospitalizations of long-stay nursing facility residents. The OPTIMISTIC (Optimizing Patient Transfers, Impacting Medical quality, and Improving Symptoms — Transforming Institutional Care) project, designed and implemented by Indiana University and partners, was one of the seven funded sites nationally.

OPTIMISTIC is a multicomponent clinical intervention designed to prevent potentially avoidable hospitalizations of long-stay nursing home residents. The intervention is implemented by project registered nurses (RNs) who are embedded within participating nursing facilities to provide enhanced staff education and direct clinical care in a specially designed role. Project RNs are supported by nurse practitioners (NPs) who are also employed by the project. The clinical intervention includes enhanced geriatric care for acute and chronic conditions focused on the early identification and management of acute conditions and proactive chronic disease care as well as collaboration with primary care providers. Project RNs provide training and modeling in the use of tools to support communication created as part of the "Interventions to Reduce Acute Care Transfers" (INTERACT) model. A second component of the intervention model is a focus on safer transitions for residents who do transfer through improved communication. Following a resident transfer and return to the nursing facility, Project RNs complete a detailed root cause analysis using a modified INTERACT transfer tracking and quality improvement tool to identify contributing factors. Project NPs also conduct medication reconciliation and meet with the resident and family to provide education as well as review goals of care. The third component of the intervention model focuses on palliative care with an emphasis on advance care planning. All Project RNs and NPs are certified in the Respecting Choices Advanced Steps facilitation model to support high-quality advance care planning and provided with structure to ensure every resident is given the opportunity to participate in advance care planning conversations. Education about end-of-life care and symptom management was provided using the geriatric End-of-Life Nursing Education Consortium curriculum and through consultation with a palliative care physician. Fidelity was monitored through an ongoing review of clinical outcomes data by the Medical, Transitions, and Palliative Care Cores responsible for oversight of each intervention component to identify and address variability in intervention delivery.

### Standards of nutrition care practice and professional performance for nutrition support and generalist nurses [^116U7bAA]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2016). Medium credibility.

General nursing practice and nutrition support nursing specialty practice — plan-of-care evaluation competencies include: evaluates the accuracy of the nutrition-related diagnosis and the effectiveness of the nutrition intervention and other variables in relation to the patient's expected outcomes, and adapts the nutrition plan of care for the trajectory of treatment according to evaluation of response to nutrition interventions.

### The impact of a multidisciplinary self-care management program on quality of life, self-care, adherence to anti-hypertensive therapy, glycemic control, and renal function in diabetic kidney disease: a cross-over study protocol [^1175v8Cf]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

One of the study limitations can be attributed to the role of APN. She delivers the coordination of care as part of the study MSMP intervention and is directly involved in outcome data organization. She is overseeing data collection when not blinded to treatment allocation. However, outcomes measurements were carried out by the participant himself for the self-reported questionnaire and by an independent laboratory for the clinical outcomes. These measures prohibited the APN from influencing data collection directly.

This study will shed the light on an advanced role for nurses in Switzerland. It is also evaluating the impact of integrating a theory based nursing role into practice. The roles of the APN, the diabetes specialized nurse, and the flow of the coordination among all team-members is designed in a way that meets the dynamics of the Swiss healthcare system, while at the same time introducing a new role for nurses. In addition to the usual medically delegated tasks, the nurse has the opportunity to exercise her critical thinking and demonstrate her role in the multidisciplinary team through her assessment, competencies in patient follow-up and coordination of care. One strength of this study is the fostering of collaboration between the public and the private sector in Switzerland. However, this collaboration adds a major challenge to patient care coordination. This is due to the fact that the multidisciplinary team in this study is not based at the same place. Some team members are working in the public sector, some others in the private sector and at differing locations. Therefore, the multidisciplinary team collaboration is "virtual" and proper communication is essential to make up for the lack of a physical setting for encounters and constant exchange. To improve coordination of participants' visits to different healthcare professionals, the appointments with the dieticians and the diabetes specialized nurse were centralized with the APN. As each of these providers had other patients outside the study to look after, coordination of appointment may present as a limitation. When participants miss an appointment, rescheduling becomes constraining and much exchanging is necessary in order to achieve a successful rescheduling. In an exploratory study, using focus groups with patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the lack of individualized and coordinated care were the most often reported perceived barriers to effective implementation of self-care plans. Beyond these difficulties, results of this study will highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary care with self-care management as a primary goal, for ensuring an individualized collaborative approach, in which the patient plays a major role.

### An official American Thoracic Society workshop report: the integrated care of the COPD patient [^114cTkgx]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2012). Medium credibility.

Integrated care for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — definition, core components, outcomes, and gaps — integrated care is described as the global, patient-focused, and interdisciplinary delivery of high-quality care that addresses the disease, its systemic manifestations, and its comorbidities; it encompasses disease prevention, promotion of a healthy lifestyle, early disease recognition and enhanced case finding, optimization of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapy with the help of evidence-based guidelines, self management education, and coordination of hospital and community services, and aims to improve processes and outcomes by making more efficient use of scant healthcare resources. A systematic review concluded that applying the chronic disease model to COPD management resulted in fewer emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and hospital-days, with these positive outcomes realized only in programs that included at least two of advanced access to knowledgeable healthcare providers, self-management education and support including individualized action plans, guideline-based therapy, and a clinical registry system. Comorbidity impacts significantly on COPD progression, healthcare utilization and mortality, single disease guidelines are woefully inadequate in patients with multiple comorbidities, the implementation of integrated care is in its infancy, and more high-quality research is needed.

### Best practices for improving flow and care of pediatric patients in the emergency department [^113Tga6g]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Pediatric emergency department (ED) flow and care — ED care and flow can be improved by implementing best practices at several steps in the workflow, with points of impact that can reduce ED boarding, improve pediatric patient safety, and promote effective, efficient, timely, and patientcentered care. These points of impact include the 5-level triage system and nurse-initiated emergency care pathways at the point of initial assessment without delay in seeing a provider; fast tracking and cohorting of patients, clinical pathways, and responsive staffing as patients advance through the ED system. Specific plans may be in place for any patient boarded while awaiting care for an emotional illness and/or substance abuse issue. Interdisciplinary collaborative research and education are needed to develop and implement new solutions and strategies to both prevent and manage ED crowding. Quality improvement programs identify performance measures and related interventions that are cost-effective, and guidelines for performance indicators recommend consideration of the following: (1) the strength of evidence supporting the measure, (2) the clinical relevance of the outcomes associated with the performance measure, and (3) the magnitude of the relationship between the performance measure and outcome, while also emphasizing the expense of implementing performance measurement when selecting a measure; all health care providers involved in the delivery of pediatric emergency care are actively engaged in defining what pediatric quality care is and how to translate best practices into guidelines that are easily disseminated and simple to follow.

### The impact of multidisciplinary transitional care interventions for complex care needs: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112opL8m]. The Gerontologist (2025). Medium credibility.

For interpreting the results of the individual comparisons, we followed the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Instead of solely looking at the statistical significance of comparisons, the GRADE approach "downgrades" the level of evidence of a comparison based on five factors to provide a more solid foundation for clinical decision-making:

Overall risk of bias: downgrading the certainty of the evidence when the methodological quality of the body of evidence was a threat (i.e. if > 50% of the trials were assessed as high risk).
Consistency: downgrading the certainty of the evidence when effects were inconsistent across studies (i.e. if I ² was > 50%).
Precision: downgrading the certainty of the evidence when confidence intervals were wide, hence when the uncertainty around the pooled effect size was considered too large (i.e. if one or both boundaries of the confidence interval suggested inferences appreciably different from the point estimate). When the confidence interval was very wide, we downgraded two levels.
Directness: downgrading the certainty of the evidence when evidence was obtained from different populations than the population studied.
Publication bias: downgrading the certainty of the evidence when there was evidence of selective reporting of outcomes based on the direction or strength of the effect or their statistical significance (i.e. if the Egger's test p value was < .05 or examination of funnel plots indicated publication bias).

In line with the GRADE approach, we refer to the level of evidence as "certainty".

Subgroup Analysis

To assess whether different intervention types had different effects on the primary and secondary outcomes, we categorized interventions into three distinct types before conducting any analysis. This categorization was based on discussions among our research team members, including many allied health professionals.

Type 1 interventions consisted of setting up a transitional care plan in-hospital and referring patients to relevant community care (allied health) professionals;
Type 2 interventions were similar to type 1 interventions. However, they comprised a case manager who coordinated hospital-to-home transitions by facilitating interactions between the hospital, patients and their families, and community care settings.
Type 3 interventions were the most complex as they comprised a comprehensive recovery trajectory delivered by dedicated multidisciplinary teams from the hospital who took care of the entire postdischarge rehabilitation process through outpatient rehabilitation, home visits, and phone calls.

### Computer decision support systems for asthma: a systematic review [^115MrGB2]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Materials and Methods

Our protocol is registered with the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD 42012002412). We followed the methodology described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

Inclusion criteria

We used the PICOS (Participants, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes, Study design) strategy for describing trials in which we were interested:

Participants

As this study is a review of the evidence, the study participants were de facto the health professionals using CDSSs who were caring for people with asthma — i.e. doctors, nurses and others (e.g. physiotherapists).

Intervention

We adopted Wyatt et al. 's definition of CDSs as 'active knowledge systems which use two or more items of patient data to generate case-specific advice'. aynes and Wilczynski similarly described such systems as 'information technology which matches characteristics of individual patients to a computerised knowledge base', with software algorithms generating patient-specific information in the form of recommendations. There are various levels of sophistication for CDSSs, from reminders to enter specific data, prescribe certain drugs/vaccines or provide an asthma action plan, to a system retrieving patient asthma information from an electronic health-care record and providing a critique on the intended clinical action. Systems were included if they used patient data to generate case-specific asthma advice. Systems relating only to the task of asthma diagnosis or those exclusively providing patients with support for self-management were excluded.

Comparator

The comparator was 'usual care', specifically without the use of a CDSS.

Outcomes

Our primary interest was in the impact of CDSSs on clinical asthma control. In line with recommended guidelines, we included outcomes that reflected current control (including asthma-related quality of life) and frequency of asthma exacerbations (including frequency of the general practitioner's asthma visits, emergency department asthma visits and asthma hospitalisations).

We were also interested in the process by which CDSSs might impact asthma control, both practical usage issues (e.g. the proportion of professionals who actually used the CDSS, the numbers of alerts issued and the impact on time within the consultation) as well as process measures reflecting enhanced guideline adherence (e.g. changes in treatment, in tests ordered and in the proportion of patients with asthma action plans).

Study design

All reports of randomised controlled trials of CDSSs used by health-care professionals for patients with asthma, in any language, published and unpublished, were eligible for inclusion. No other study designs were included.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of tinnitus: recommendations from the US VA / DOD clinical practice guideline work group [^111FYimP]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Evaluating outcomes, stepped care, and referrals for tinnitus — patients requiring clinical intervention for tinnitus differ widely with respect to the impact of tinnitus on their daily lives, and the spectrum of clinical needs is broad, ranging from basic education to long-term individualized support. Tinnitus care should be provided in a stepwise hierarchical approach to provide clinical services only to the degree needed by the patient, and a collaborative guided plan of care should include ongoing assessment of tinnitus impact using tinnitus questionnaires to identify which situations impact QoL. Depending on the severity of the impact, the guided plan of care might include referrals to other services, provision of continued supportive services, or both, if QoL outcomes fail to improve; personalized interventions should be adjusted to the tinnitus-specific impacts via shared decision making after educating the patient on further tinnitus management options, allowing collaborative modification of individualized action plans and improved functional status.

### Patients' and healthcare professionals' perspectives on the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis care journey: a qualitative study [^115SZapK]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Delivery system design

Team-based care that integrates the unique perspectives and expertise of different HCPs and actively involves patients, is essential to meet the patients' needs. Our findings underlined the need to expand the team's multidisciplinary composition due to the comprehensive needs of the IPF population. More specifically, a nurse-led consultation could be of value in providing long-term follow-up care of pharmacological and nonpharmacological needs. Although still in its infancy for ILD services, nurse-led care in other ambulatory settings was shown to be feasible and could focus on HRQoL, self-management support and symptom-centred care. However, adequate training and support should be foreseen. Although more research is needed on the economic impact, the increasing importance of the role and impact of nurses specialised in ILD should not be undermined. In addition to providing team-based care, chronic illnesses such as IPF need regular follow-up and pro-active care. A case manager could aid the identification and follow-up of patients' needs, not only in the diagnostic pathway but across the entire care continuum. Case management is defined as "a collaborative process of assessment, planning, facilitation, care coordination, evaluation and advocacy for options and services to meet an individual's and family's comprehensive health needs through communication and available resources to promote patient safety, quality of care, and cost-effective outcomes". In IPF care, a case conference on patients' needs with multidisciplinary members was shown to be feasible, whereby a nurse took up the role of a case manager. Shared care with general practitioners was regarded as an interesting challenge according to our participants due to the lack of knowledge and expertise regarding the disease. Although awareness initiatives and education could be pivotal, the importance of continuing concentrating care in centres of expertise was highlighted. A systematic review investigating the impact of shared care management across several chronic diseases mentioned a positive impact for depression management, but suggested limited effects on other outcomes, such as on the quality of life and medication use. Importantly, to have effective team-based care, an appropriate communication approach is needed between members of the team as well as with external HCPs. A survey regarding communication challenges in IPF care mentioned recommendations to improve communication with HCPs such as better information-sharing with local HCPs. From our interviews, it was clear that more research on the communication and discussions regarding advance care planning is necessary.

### Person-centered care planning for people living with or at risk for multiple chronic conditions [^117AxY16]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What do persons seeking care and their caregivers, health care practitioners, professional and nonprofit associations, and health care organizations believe are innovative approaches and challenges to implementing person-centered care planning (PCCP) for people living with or at risk for multiple chronic conditions?

Findings

In this qualitative study including 58 respondents, 9 themes were identified through a thematic analysis of responses to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Request for Information. Themes described key components of PCCP for multiple chronic conditions and challenges and strategies to overcome them, including multidisciplinary teams, digital health technologies, workflow changes, payment policies, and goal alignment.

Meaning

These findings suggest that despite barriers to implementing PCCP, there is much opportunity to transform care delivery by amplifying and coordinating current efforts.

The use of non-standardized and potentially inappropriate ACP outcomes in research also makes it difficult to evaluate ACP's effectiveness. Goal-concordant care has been considered the "gold standard", but there is a lack of validated or standardized measures. – Because patient preferences may change, reliance on retrospective chart review to assess goal concordance may be inaccurate, and there is a growing consensus that surrogate outcomes should be one key focus of ACP research. Additionally, ACP is unlikely to affect some outcomes such as quality of life, which may be impacted by other factors such as symptom burden, available support, and so forth, or healthcare utilization, which is not patient-centered and affected by lack of healthcare access, systemic injustice, and other issues.

Furthermore, the unique needs of historically marginalized populations are not well represented in prior definitions and outcomes identification. Rates of ACP are much lower (< 20%) among racially or ethnically minoritized populations and those with limited health literacy. – Disparities in ACP also persist for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersexual, asexual, homeless, and incarcerated populations. Reasons may include lack of access to healthcare, experiential discrimination, well-founded mistrust, and culturally diverse views on autonomy and decision-making, making it preferable for many to begin care planning discussions in their communities. Diverse communities, as well as interdisciplinary clinicians and community-based experts, have not been included in prior efforts to define ACP and ACP outcomes.

### A qualitative study of processes used to implement evidence-based care in a primary care practice [^111RbR7s]. Family Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence-based guidelines for care of coronary heart disease patients are not fully implemented. Primary care practices provide most of the care for these patients.

Objective

To learn how providers and staff in a busy primary care practice implement interventions to provide evidence-based care of coronary heart disease patients.

Methods

We conducted a qualitative analysis of the responses to open-ended questions in nine electronically administered bimonthly surveys of key physicians, clinic staff and managers in the practice.

Results

Ten to 16 (mean = 12.3) personnel responded to each survey. Nearly 30% were physicians and 40.5% were clinic staff. Four major themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: (i) giving data about not-at-goal patients to providers for care plan development; (ii) developing team roles and defining tasks; (iii) providing patient care and implementing care plans and (iv) providing technology support to generate useful, accurate data. The frequency that the subthemes were mentioned varied from survey to survey, but their mention persisted over the entire time of all nine surveys.

Conclusions

Developing a system for implementing evidence-based care involves considerations of roles and teamwork, technology use to develop a patient registry and obtain needed clinical data, care processes for pre-visit planning, and between-visit care management. A registered nurse care manager is a central figure in implementing and sustaining the process. Implementing evidence-based guidelines is an ongoing process of revision, retraining and reinforcement.

### Surge capacity logistics: care of the critically ill and injured during pandemics and disasters: CHEST consensus statement [^111BjB9z]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

Nursing staff surge planning — We suggest critical care nurse-to-patient ratios in an event requiring critical care surge be determined by provider experience, available support (ancillary staff), and clinical demands. During a disaster or pandemic it is not feasible to maintain the typical 1:1 or 1:2 North American ICU nurse-to-patient ratios. Patient care is increasingly compromised at higher ratios of patients to staff, with data suggesting a 7% increase in adverse outcomes for each patient above 4:1 in general medical surgical care, and hospitals planning for radiation-related casualties plan a nurse-to-patient ratio not to exceed 8:1.
