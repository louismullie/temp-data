## Question

Is CoQ10 as good as ibuprofen for inflammation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether CoQ10 is as good as ibuprofen for inflammation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanisms of ibuprofen and CoQ10. Then, I should verify the clinical evidence for anti-inflammatory effects of CoQ10 across conditions. Next, I will compare magnitude, onset, and consistency of effects. After that, I need to consider safety, cost, and guideline positions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and note any exceptions or uncertainties that might change practice in the future.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic distinction, because that frames expectations. Ibuprofen is a nonselective NSAID that inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2, thereby reducing prostaglandin synthesis and producing analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects, which is why it is a first-line agent for acute inflammatory pain in standard care pathways [^113snEKB]. In contrast, CoQ10 is a mitochondrial cofactor and antioxidant that may modulate oxidative stress and, in some models, repress inflammatory gene expression, but it lacks direct COX inhibition and is not classified as an anti-inflammatory drug in clinical practice [^113Ystpu] [^115uvcK1].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical evidence for CoQ10's anti-inflammatory effects rather than assume. In sepsis, randomized trials show that ubiquinol increases plasma CoQ10 levels but does not improve inflammatory biomarkers or clinical outcomes, which argues against clinically meaningful anti-inflammatory benefit in that acute setting [^116Gixdn] [^112rwzkA]. In statin-treated patients, adding CoQ10 did not further reduce inflammatory markers beyond statins alone, again suggesting no additive anti-inflammatory effect in that context [^1137bwuw]. In hemodialysis, a dose-escalation study found no reduction in IL-6 and proposed that any salutary effects were likely via mitochondrial coupling rather than systemic anti-inflammatory action, which aligns with the mechanistic expectation [^111oby4K]. In migraine, pediatric and adult RCTs show mixed or null effects on headache outcomes, indicating no consistent anti-inflammatory clinical signal in that domain either [^117YSmQi] [^116xS1D4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double-check whether any human trials demonstrate robust anti-inflammatory outcomes with CoQ10. I do not find high-quality RCTs showing consistent reductions in validated inflammatory endpoints like CRP, IL-6, or TNF-α across diverse populations, and the best-supported uses of CoQ10 remain in mitochondrial or antioxidant contexts rather than as an anti-inflammatory therapy, which reinforces that any anti-inflammatory effects are modest, indirect, and context-dependent at best.

> Next, I should review comparative effectiveness pragmatically. Ibuprofen 400–800 mg every 6–8 hours provides predictable analgesic and anti-inflammatory relief within hours for common inflammatory pain states, with well-characterized dose-response and safety trade-offs, which is why it is embedded in trauma and acute pain guidelines [^112ehMaG] [^113snEKB]. By contrast, CoQ10 lacks comparable onset, magnitude, or consistency for symptom relief in acute inflammation, and there is no established dosing paradigm for anti-inflammatory indications, which makes it impractical as a substitute for NSAIDs in typical clinical scenarios [^116Gixdn].

> I need to ensure safety and feasibility are weighed appropriately. Ibuprofen carries gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular risks that scale with dose and comorbidity, but these are well defined and manageable in standard practice, whereas CoQ10 is generally well tolerated but can be costly and is not covered by insurance for this purpose, which matters for sustained use and access [^113snEKB] [^115uvcK1]. But wait, what if someone is statin-intolerant and using CoQ10 for myalgias? Even there, meta-analyses show no consistent benefit of CoQ10 for statin-associated muscle symptoms, so using CoQ10 as an anti-inflammatory substitute remains unsupported [^111K83pW] [^112ERkWf].

> Let me consider guideline positions to anchor the recommendation. Contemporary headache guidelines judge CoQ10 evidence as inconsistent and insufficient to recommend for migraine prevention, and sepsis trials do not support CoQ10 as an anti-inflammatory adjunct, which collectively underscores the absence of a therapeutic niche for CoQ10 in inflammatory symptom control [^116xS1D4] [^114wyxcA] [^116Gixdn]. Meanwhile, NSAIDs remain foundational for acute inflammatory pain management in trauma and primary care algorithms, reinforcing the comparative advantage of ibuprofen for inflammation-driven symptoms [^113snEKB].

> I should confirm the bottom line and any caveats. No, CoQ10 is not as good as ibuprofen for inflammation; ibuprofen has direct, rapid, and reproducible anti-inflammatory effects supported by extensive clinical experience and guidelines, whereas CoQ10 shows, at most, modest and inconsistent signals without established anti-inflammatory dosing or outcomes, so it should not be used as a replacement for NSAIDs in acute inflammatory conditions [^113snEKB] [^116Gixdn] [^1137bwuw]. That said, if a patient is pursuing mitochondrial support or has a specific mitochondrial disorder where CoQ10 is indicated, it may be reasonable alongside — but not instead of — evidence-based anti-inflammatory therapy when inflammation is the clinical target [^115J8fT7].

---

CoQ10 is **not as effective as ibuprofen** for acute inflammation. Ibuprofen provides rapid, clinically proven anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects via COX inhibition [^113snEKB], whereas CoQ10 has **limited and inconsistent anti-inflammatory evidence** in humans [^116Gixdn] and is not recommended for acute inflammatory pain. CoQ10 may have a role as an adjunct in chronic inflammatory or mitochondrial-related conditions, but it should not replace NSAIDs for acute inflammation.

---

## Mechanisms of action

### Ibuprofen

Ibuprofen is a **nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)** that inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2), thereby reducing prostaglandin synthesis and producing anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects [^1156AFGP]. This mechanism is well-established and accounts for its rapid and effective relief of inflammation and pain.

---

### Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)

CoQ10 is a **mitochondrial antioxidant** that supports cellular energy production and may modulate oxidative stress and inflammation indirectly. Preclinical studies suggest potential anti-inflammatory effects, such as reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-α, IL-6) and oxidative stress markers, but human data are limited and inconsistent [^116Gixdn] [^112rwzkA].

---

## Clinical evidence for anti-inflammatory effects

### Ibuprofen

Ibuprofen has extensive clinical evidence supporting its **anti-inflammatory efficacy** in acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, including arthritis, musculoskeletal pain, and fever. It is widely recommended as a first-line treatment for mild to moderate inflammatory pain due to its rapid onset and reliable efficacy [^113snEKB].

---

### Coenzyme Q10

Human evidence for CoQ10's anti-inflammatory effects is limited and inconsistent:

- **Sepsis**: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) found that ubiquinol (reduced CoQ10) increased plasma CoQ10 levels but showed no significant improvement in inflammatory biomarkers or clinical outcomes [^116Gixdn] [^112rwzkA].
- **Statin therapy**: CoQ10 supplementation did not significantly reduce inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-α, hsCRP) in patients on statins [^1137bwuw].
- **Migraine**: Some studies suggest CoQ10 may reduce migraine frequency, possibly via mitochondrial effects, but evidence for direct anti-inflammatory effects is weak [^114smyKu] [^116xS1D4].

---

## Comparative effectiveness

| **Parameter** | **Ibuprofen** | **CoQ10** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism of action | COX inhibition | Mitochondrial antioxidant |
| Clinical evidence | Extensive and robust | Limited and inconsistent |
| Onset of action | Rapid (hours) | Slow (weeks to months) |
| Recommended use | Acute inflammation and pain | Adjunctive therapy for chronic conditions |
| Guideline support | Strong | Limited |

---

## Safety considerations

Ibuprofen is generally safe at recommended doses but carries risks of gastrointestinal bleeding, renal impairment, and cardiovascular events, especially with prolonged use or in high-risk patients [^113snEKB]. CoQ10 is **generally well-tolerated** with minimal side effects, but its long-term safety at high doses remains uncertain.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines **do not recommend CoQ10** as a primary anti-inflammatory therapy. Ibuprofen and other NSAIDs remain the standard of care for acute inflammatory pain, while CoQ10 may be considered as an adjunctive therapy in specific chronic conditions, such as heart failure or mitochondrial disorders, but not for acute inflammation [^113snEKB] [^112rZC9m].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

CoQ10 is **not as effective as ibuprofen** for acute inflammation. Ibuprofen remains the preferred choice for rapid and reliable relief of inflammatory pain, while CoQ10 may be considered as an adjunctive therapy in chronic inflammatory or mitochondrial-related conditions. Clinicians should prioritize evidence-based NSAIDs for acute inflammation and reserve CoQ10 for specific clinical scenarios where its potential benefits may be relevant.

Results

A total of 18 subjects were randomized in the initial trial. Of these 18 patients, one patient died prior to the 72-hour follow-up examination and three had no follow-up blood specimen available and were therefore excluded from the current analysis. Of the 18 patients in the original trial, 14 had CoQ10 levels measured at both 0 and 72 hours, and these 28 samples were included in our analysis (Figure 1). The baseline characteristics of these 14 patients are provided in Table 1. In addition, we measured CoQ10 levels in 16 healthy controls. The median age of the septic shock patients was 55 years (IQR 47 to 62 years), and 64% of them were females. The severity of illness was assessed using the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, with a median score of 19 (IQR 17 to 21). There was no difference in severity of illness between groups in the initial trial on the basis of APACHE II scoring (placebo: 19 (IQR 18 to 20), statin: 17 (IQR 16 to 21)) or lactic acid (placebo: 2.0 mmol/L (IQR 1.9 to 2.2), statin: 2.3 mmol/L (IQR 1.3 to 3.3)).

### A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover, add-on study of coEnzyme Q10 in the prevention of pediatric and adolescent migraine [^117YSmQi]. Cephalalgia (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation in the prevention of migraine in children using a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover, add-on trial.

Background

CoQ10 has been demonstrated to have efficacy in migraine prevention in adults but lacks pediatric research with more rigorous methodology. CoQ10 has been observed to be deficient in a significant number of children and adolescents presenting to tertiary headache centers. CoQ10 has the potential to modify both the inflammatory changes that occur during recurrent migraine and the alteration of mitochondrial function. A deficit of CoQ10 could thus affect the response to treatment and clinical characteristics of migraine in children and adults.

Methods

One-hundred-and-twenty children and adolescents with migraine headache were randomized in a crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, add-on study to receive a placebo or CoQ10 (100 mg) supplement for 224 days. Data for 76 patients were available at the crossover point and 50 were analysed at the endpoint. Response to treatment, overall headache improvement, and headache disability were assessed.

Results

Both the placebo and CoQ10 groups showed reduced migraine frequency [F(1, 60) = 15.68, p < 0.001], severity [F(1, 54) = 8.09, p = 0.006], and duration [F(1, 45) = 6.27, p = 0.016] over time. CoQ10 treated patients had a significantly greater improvement in frequency from subject reported baseline starting within 4 weeks of initiation. No group differences comparing the first 4 weeks of treatment with the last 4 weeks of treatment were found in migraine frequency [F(1, 60) = 2.34, p > 0.05], severity [F(1, 54) = 0.06, p > 0.05], or duration [F(1, 45) = 0.14, p > 0.05].

Conclusions

Overall, results of the study demonstrate that children and adolescents with migraine improved over time with multidisciplinary, standardized treatment regardless of supplementation with CoQ10 or placebo. There was no difference in headache outcomes between the CoQ10 and placebo groups at day 224. Due to the improvements seen in weeks 1–4, CoQ10 may lead to earlier improvement in headache severity, but given the sample size this conclusion warrants further investigation with a larger sample.

### Ubiquinol (reduced coenzyme Q10) in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot trial [^116Gixdn]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Key messages

Coenzyme Q10 is an essential component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.
In this placebo-controlled, randomized, pilot trial we found that enteral administration of ubiquinol (reduced coenzyme Q10) increases total Coenzyme Q10 levels, Coenzyme Q10 levels relative to cholesterol levels, and levels of oxidized and reduced Coenzyme Q10.
There was no difference in vascular endothelial biomarkers, inflammatory biomarkers, or biomarkers related to mitochondrial injury, including cytochrome c levels.
We found no difference in clinical outcomes between the ubiquinol and placebo groups.

### Ubiquinol (reduced coenzyme Q10) in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot trial [^112rwzkA]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We have shown that ubiquinol is absorbed in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. There were no significant changes in VEGF, VCAM-1, the majority of inflammatory markers, or clinical outcomes, such as mortality and length of ICU and hospital stay. Further investigation with different dosages, timing of drug delivery, or more specific populations may be warranted to determine whether ubiquinol administration may be beneficial as an adjunct therapy in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

Outcome measures

The primary outcome of the study was change in plasma CoQ10 parameters (total CoQ10 levels, CoQ10 levels relative to cholesterol levels, levels of oxidized (ubiquinone) and reduced (ubiquinol) CoQ10, and the fraction of reduced CoQ10 (reduced CoQ10/total CoQ10 levels)).

Secondary outcomes included were: 1) assessment of vascular endothelial function via vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VCAM-1 measurements, 2) assessment of inflammation via IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α measurements, 3) assessment of mitochondrial injury via cytochrome c levels and DNA markers, and 4) assessment of clinical outcomes (length of ICU and hospital stay, and in-hospital mortality).

Measurement of Coenzyme Q10 levels and biomarkers

CoQ10 levels were measured in plasma samples by the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (Cincinnati, Ohio, USA) using high-performance liquid chromatography as previously described in detail. We measured three different CoQ10 parameters (total CoQ10, oxidized CoQ10, and reduced CoQ10 (all measured in μg/mL)), as well as total cholesterol levels. From these, two additional parameters were calculated: total CoQ10/cholesterol and reduced CoQ10/total CoQ10. CoQ10 levels were measured at the 0, 12, and 24 h time points.

Plasma samples were analyzed for multiple vascular endothelial and inflammatory markers (VEGF, VCAM-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) using customized Meso Scale Discovery Human Multiplex Panel (Rockville, Maryland, USA). All samples were measured in duplicate with the inter-assay coefficients of variability ranging from 2.2 to 5.8%. VCAM-1 is reported in log-transformed μg/mL and the rest of the markers in log-transformed pg/mL. Cytokine levels were measured at the 0, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h time points.

Materials and methods

Design and setting

This was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, pilot phase II trial comparing ubiquinol to placebo in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. The study was conducted at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), which is an urban tertiary care hospital in Boston, Massachusetts with approximately 55,000 emergency department visits annually and a total of 77 intensive care unit beds. The study was approved by the Committee on Clinical Investigations at BIDMC (approval number: 2012P-000267) and patients or their legally authorized surrogate provided written informed consent prior to enrollment. The trial was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: NCT01948063) and was sponsored by Kaneka Corporation, Japan. The trial was investigator-initiated and the sponsor was not involved in study design or conduct, and had no role in manuscript preparation.

Study population

The hospital's emergency department and intensive care units were screened for eligible patients between November 2012 and January 2014. Inclusion criteria were that patients were aged ≥ 18 years and were diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock. Severe sepsis was defined as the presence of two or more systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria, documented or suspected infection, and evidence of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction or tissue hypoperfusion as defined by the Surviving Sepsis campaign. Septic shock was defined as sepsis-induced hypotension persisting despite adequate fluid resuscitation, in accordance with the Surviving Sepsis campaign definitions.

We excluded patients based on the following criteria: 1) currently on CoQ10 supplementation, 2) unable to receive enteral medication per the clinical team, 3) enrolled in another ongoing study, 4) non-English speaking, 5) patient unable to consent and legally authorized surrogate not present, 6) 'do not resuscitate', 'do not intubate' or 'comfort measures only' designation, or 7) member of a protected population.

### Efficacy of coenzyme Q10 in migraine prophylaxis: a randomized controlled trial [^114smyKu]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Riboflavin, which improves energy metabolism similarly to coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), is effective in migraine prophylaxis. We compared CoQ10 (3 × 100 mg/day) and placebo in 42 migraine patients in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. CoQ10 was superior to placebo for attack-frequency, headache-days and days-with-nausea in the third treatment month and well tolerated; 50%-responder-rate for attack frequency was 14.4% for placebo and 47.6% for CoQ10 (number-needed-to-treat: 3). CoQ10 is efficacious and well tolerated.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the levels of CoQ10 in humans with septic shock. In this post hoc analysis of a prospective, randomized trial, we found that patients in septic shock have significantly lower levels of plasma CoQ10 compared to a normal healthy control population. Furthermore, we found a statistically significant inverse relationship between plasma CoQ10 levels with inflammatory cytokines and vascular endothelial biomarkers.

CoQ10 is an essential component of the electron transport chain, acting as an electron transporter of mitochondrial complexes I and II to complex III. Disruption of this mechanism can compromise the oxidative capacity of the mitochondria and lead to a decreased level of energy production. Mitochondria are the primary organelles for cellular energy production, and mitochondrial dysfunction can be detrimental in critical illness. The presence of mitochondrial dysfunction in septic shock has been described previously, though the exact components and reasons for this dysfunction are not completely known. The hypothesis that CoQ10 deficiency contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction remains plausible. Our findings that plasma CoQ10 levels are abnormally low in a septic shock cohort compared to healthy adults supports this potential link.

### Coenzyme Q10 levels are low and may be associated with the inflammatory cascade in septic shock [^111kKmqD]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

CoQ10 levels are abnormally low in patients with septic shock compared to controls. The clinical significance of this abnormality remains unknown but should be explored, given the essential role that CoQ10 has in the electron transport chain. Low levels of CoQ10 may be associated with high levels of inflammatory cytokines and vascular endothelial biomarkers, though adjusting for LDL (carrier of CoQ10) diminishes this association and may explain this finding.

### Coenzyme Q10 levels are low and may be associated with the inflammatory cascade in septic shock [^112iiQpf]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Statins may hold therapeutic value for the prevention and/or treatment of patients with sepsis. Previous investigations have demonstrated important immunomodulatory activity of statins on the inflammatory response and direct alterations of leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions. Furthermore, statin therapy has been associated with decreased morbidity and mortality in patients with sepsis. However, statins may also decrease levels of CoQ10, an essential component of the respiratory chain, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction.

The statin, CoQ10 and sepsis triangulation was recently reviewed, and the lack of human data to support theoretical assumptions and hypotheses was noted. Specifically, Brealey et al. stated that low levels of antioxidants cause mitochondrial dysfunction in human sepsis, but there are currently no data to account for the levels of the mitochondrial component CoQ10. Herein we report on the levels of plasma CoQ10 in patients with septic shock and the relationship between CoQ10 and the inflammatory cascade. The primary goal of this investigation was to determine whether patients with septic shock have decreased plasma CoQ10 compared to healthy controls. Our secondary aims were to determine whether CoQ10 levels are associated with the sepsis-induced inflammatory response and vascular endothelial activation and to determine whether acute statin therapy reduces CoQ10 levels. We measured CoQ10 levels and inflammatory and vascular endothelial biomarkers in plasma that had been collected in a prospective, randomized trial of statins versus placebo for patients with septic shock.

### Ubiquinol (reduced coenzyme Q10) in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot trial [^112wannM]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

We previously found decreased levels of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in patients with septic shock. The objective of the current study was to assess whether the provision of exogenous ubiquinol (the reduced form of CoQ10) could increase plasma CoQ10 levels and improve mitochondrial function.

Methods

We performed a randomized, double-blind, pilot trial at a single, tertiary care hospital. Adults (age ≥ 18 years) with severe sepsis or septic shock between November 2012 and January 2014 were included. Patients received 200 mg enteral ubiquinol or placebo twice a day for up to seven days. Blood draws were obtained at baseline (0 h), 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. The primary outcome of the study was change in plasma CoQ10 parameters (total CoQ10 levels, CoQ10 levels relative to cholesterol levels, and levels of oxidized and reduced CoQ10). Secondary outcomes included assessment of: 1) vascular endothelial biomarkers, 2) inflammatory biomarkers, 3) biomarkers related to mitochondrial injury including cytochrome c levels, and 4) clinical outcomes. CoQ10 levels and biomarkers were compared between groups using repeated measures models.

Results

We enrolled 38 patients: 19 in the CoQ10 group and 19 in the placebo group. The mean patient age was 62 ± 16 years and 47% were female. Baseline characteristics and CoQ10 levels were similar for both groups. There was a significant increase in total CoQ10 levels, CoQ10 levels relative to cholesterol levels, and levels of oxidized and reduced CoQ10 in the ubiquinol group compared to the placebo group. We found no difference between the two groups in any of the secondary outcomes.

Conclusions

In this pilot trial we showed that plasma CoQ10 levels could be increased in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, with the administration of oral ubiquinol. Further research is needed to address whether ubiquinol administration can result in improved clinical outcomes in this patient population.

### Ubiquinol (reduced coenzyme Q10) in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot trial [^116EpUbH]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Severe sepsis and septic shock continue to be leading causes of morbidity and mortality despite widespread implementation of strategies focused on early antibiotic administration and aggressive resuscitation. Annually there are an estimated 751,000 cases of severe sepsis in the United States, with mortality upwards of 29%. Sepsis-induced multiple organ system failure is a common final pathway believed to be caused by a systemic inflammatory response involving micro- and macro-circulatory dysfunction and alterations in cellular metabolism, particularly mitochondrial dysfunction, though the exact mechanisms remain unknown. Recent large trials of specific hemodynamic interventions have failed to show a clear benefit in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, and new adjunct therapies are needed to improve outcomes.

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a fat-soluble molecule synthesized in the mitochondrial inner membrane that exists both in oxidized form (ubiquinone) and reduced form (ubiquinol). The mitochondrial electron transport chain contains two transporters (CoQ10 and cytochrome c) and four complexes (I-IV). CoQ10 plays an essential role in the electron transport chain as the carrier of electrons from complex I and II to complex III. Disruption of this mechanism can compromise oxidative phosphorylation, thereby leading to decreased levels of cellular energy (adenosine triphosphate (ATP)) production.

Our group has previously found decreased levels of CoQ10 in patients with septic shock, indicating the possibility that cellular energy production is compromised in this disease state. We also found that levels of CoQ10 were inversely associated with levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), suggesting that CoQ10 may also play a role in vascular endothelial dysfunction and the inflammatory response seen in severe sepsis and septic shock.

Based on these findings, we hypothesized that CoQ10 deficiency in septic patients may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction, and that this dysfunction could be mitigated by exogenous administration of ubiquinol (reduced CoQ10). Thus, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot trial providing enteral ubiquinol supplementation to patients with severe sepsis or septic shock to determine absorption and the effect of supplementation on systemic levels, as well as the effect of ubiquinol on mitochondrial injury, markers of inflammation, and markers of vascular endothelial injury.

### Coenzyme Q10 levels are low and may be associated with the inflammatory cascade in septic shock [^116ueV78]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Severe sepsis and septic shock are major causes of morbidity and mortality. The annual incidence of deaths due to severe sepsis and septic shock is estimated to be over 215,000 in the United States. Organ dysfunction related to sepsis is associated with significant alterations in metabolic pathways and cellular function. Although the exact mechanism by which sepsis leads to organ dysfunction remains unclear, hypoxia and several mediators in the systemic inflammatory response have been shown to directly impair mitochondrial function and may lead to increased morbidity and mortality in patients with septic shock.

Coenzyme Q (CoQ10), or ubiquinone, is located within the inner mitochondrial membrane and acts as an electron transport mediator from complex I or complex II to complex III. While a small portion of CoQ10 may be obtained from dietary sources (including food and oral supplementation), it is primarily synthesized endogenously in the endoplasmic reticulum from tyrosine and mevalonate and vitamins B 2, B 9, B 12 and C and is transported in the plasma by low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Low CoQ10 levels may result from impairment in CoQ10 synthesis, decreased dietary intake or increased requirement (such as during conditions that increase oxidative stress), or from any combination of these factors. Previous investigations have demonstrated that prolonged statin use may decrease CoQ10 levels in patients with cardiovascular disease; however, a causal effect of stain therapy on decreased CoQ10 levels remains a topic of debate. In addition to the potential negative effect that statins may have on CoQ10 levels, the increased metabolic demand resulting from sepsis may also deplete CoQ10 levels.

### Coenzyme Q10 dose-escalation study in hemodialysis patients: safety, tolerability, and effect on oxidative stress [^111oby4K]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

In order to differentiate the effects of CoQ 10 on mitochondrial coupling versus direct antioxidant effect, we evaluated the effect of CoQ 10 supplementation on ApoA-1 Met oxidation, which is selective for inflammation-mediated oxidative damage by myeloperoxidase (MPO). The lack of effect of CoQ 10 escalation on apoA-1 Met oxidation in circulating HDL suggests the salutary effect of CoQ 10 may be due to improved local mitochondrial function rather than a systemic anti-oxidant effect. The reduction of HDL-associated lipid hydroperoxides to the corresponding lipid hydroxides is responsible for specific oxidized Met residues (Met(O) 86 and Met(O) 112) in apoA-I, the major HDL protein. In addition, hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a strong oxidant produced by the phagocyte heme enzyme myeloperoxidase may selectively oxidize Met112 and Met148 in apoA-I. In addition to the lack of effect of CoQ10 supplementation on ApoA-1 Met oxidation, no significant change in IL-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine (11.2 ± 8.1 pg/mL at baseline; 15.7 ± 18.9 pg/mL at study conclusion (p = 0.56), in comparison to unrelated healthy controls with a median IL-6 concentration: 3.8 pg/mL), was observed during this study, providing more presumptive evidence that the actions of CoQ 10 are not due to a global anti- inflammatory effect. Taken together, our observations support the hypothesis that CoQ 10 supplementation reduces mitochondrial oxidative stress, rather than by increasing general antioxidant or anti-inflammatory capacity. However, we cannot rule out some contribution of general antioxidant effect to the observed reduction in oxidative stress markers.

### Ubiquinol (reduced coenzyme Q10) in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot trial [^112uSB5g]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this pilot study of ubiquinol versus placebo in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, plasma CoQ10 levels increased in patients who received ubiquinol. We found statistically significant higher levels of IL-6 in patients receiving ubiquinol as compared to those receiving placebo. The reason for this finding remains largely unexplained, but could be related to multiple testing. The assessment of other biomarkers related to vascular endothelial function, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation revealed no statistically significant difference between the ubiquinol and the placebo groups in this study.

CoQ10, as a key component of the electron transport chain, plays an important role in the mitigation of oxidative stress and production of cellular energy. Previous investigations have demonstrated that CoQ10 levels are low in critical illness, specifically septic shock and post-cardiac arrest. Multiple rat models have been used to test and demonstrate the beneficial impact of CoQ10 in sepsis and have found decreased oxidative stress, prevention of mitochondrial damage, less renal and acute liver dysfunction, and neuroprotective effects. In the current study, we demonstrate that exogenous provision of ubiquinol increases CoQ10 levels in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. The potential benefits of this increase remain unclear.

Severe sepsis is associated with respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal dysfunction, with significant alterations to metabolic pathways and cellular function. A central hypothesis in organ dysfunction is the concept of tissue hypoxia. Cytopathic hypoxia (compromised cellular oxygen utilization), rather than inadequate oxygen delivery, may play a significant role in the development of multi-organ dysfunction and lactate elevation in sepsis, although the exact mechanisms remain unknown. Despite optimization of hemodynamics and oxygen therapy, oxygen may not be utilized at the mitochondrial level. Mitochondria consume 90% of cellular oxygen in order to generate energy as ATP, via oxidative phosphorylation by transfer of electrons from the Krebs cycle to the electron transport chain, via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. The electron transport chain is located on the inner mitochondrial membrane and consists of four complexes and two transporters. CoQ10 plays an essential role in the electron transport chain as the carrier of electrons from complex I and II to complex III. Disruption of this mechanism can compromise oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria, thereby leading to decreased levels of cellular ATP production.

### Coenzyme Q10 dose-escalation study in hemodialysis patients: safety, tolerability, and effect on oxidative stress [^113NmK6F]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Five hundred thousand patients in the United States receive maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Life expectancies for MHD patients are 17–34% less than those of the general population. Some of this excess mortality may be attributable to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease as a result of increased oxidative stress. Oxidative stress can originate from multiple sources, including the decoupling of the electron transport chain in the mitochondria and inflammation-mediated production of superoxide via NADPH-oxidase and resulting altered oxygen handling capacity.

Coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10) is a required component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, where it transfers electrons from complexes 1 and 2 to complex 3. Reduction and oxidation of CoQ 10 also reduces lipid radicals and oxidizes superoxide. CoQ 10 depletion leads to inefficient electron transport, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and altered mitochondrial membrane potential. CoQ 10 treatment, on the other hand, improves mitochondrial coupling of respiration to oxidative phosphorylation, decreases superoxide production in endothelial cells, and may improve functional cardiac capacity in patients with congestive heart failure. In addition to the effects on mitochondrial transport, CoQ 10 also exerts global antioxidant effects, with the reduced form able to react directly with free radicals, wherein it is converted to the oxidized form. For these reasons, CoQ 10 is frequently administered as a dietary supplement in alternative and complementary therapy, but no studies have examined high dose CoQ 10 tolerability and efficacy in dialysis patients, a population with increased oxidative stress. F 2 -isoprostane and isofuran concentrations, products of non-enzymatic arachidonic acid peroxidation, are considered one of the most reliable approaches for assessing systemic oxidative stress in vivo. The formation of F 2 -isoprostanes and isofurans is differentially regulated by oxygen tension; the formation of F 2 -isoprostanes is favored at low oxygen tensions whereas the formation of isofurans is favored at high oxygen tensions, as occurs in the setting of mitochondrial dysfunction. Plasma F 2 -isoprostane concentrations have been shown to be two to four times higher in dialysis patients than in age- and gender- matched healthy subjects, consistent with the increased oxidative burden in this population. Plasma isofuran concentrations have not previously been reported in dialysis patients.

The present study tested the hypothesis that oral CoQ 10 administration is safe, well-tolerated, and decreases oxidative stress in MHD patients, with the additional goals of determining the maximum well-tolerated dose of CoQ 10.

### Inflammatory biomarkers in patients in simvastatin treatment: No effect of co-enzyme Q10 supplementation [^1137bwuw]. Cytokine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Atherosclerosis is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is known to be an inflammatory process. Statin therapy decreases both cholesterol and inflammation and is used in primary and secondary prevention of CVD. However, a statin induced decrease of plasma concentrations of the antioxidant coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), may prevent the patients from reaching their optimal anti-inflammatory potential. Here, we studied the anti-inflammatory effect of Simvastatin therapy and CoQ10 supplementation.

Methods

35 patients in primary prevention with Simvastatin (40 mg/day) were randomized to receive oral CoQ10 supplementation (400 mg/d) or placebo for 8 weeks. 20 patients with hypercholesterolemia who received no cholesterol-lowering treatment was a control group. Plasma concentrations of lipids and inflammatory biomarkers (interleukin-6 (IL6); -8 (IL8); -10 (IL10), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα); high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP)) as well as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were quantified before and after the intervention.

Results

No significant change in inflammatory markers or lipids was observed after CoQ10 supplementation Patients in Simvastatin therapy had significantly (P < 0.05) lower baseline concentration of IL6 (0.31 ± 0.03 pg/ml), IL8 (1.6 ± 0.1 pg/ml) IL10 (0.16 ± 0.02 pg/ml) and borderline (P = 0.053) lower TNFα (0.88 ± 0.05 pg/ml), but not hsCRP (1.34 ± 0.19 mg/l) compared with the control group (0.62 ± 0.08, 2.6 ± 0.2, 0.25 ± 0.01, 1.07 ± 0.09, and 1.90 ± 0.35, respectively).

Conclusions

Simvastatin therapy has beneficial effects on inflammatory markers in plasma, but CoQ10 supplementation seems to have no additional potentiating effect in patients in primary prevention. In contrast, glucose homeostasis may improve with CoQ10 supplementation.

### Coenzyme Q10 levels are low and may be associated with the inflammatory cascade in septic shock [^1177RaFR]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with increased mortality in septic shock. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a key cofactor in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, but whether CoQ10 is depleted in septic shock remains unknown. Moreover, statin therapy may decrease CoQ10 levels, but whether this occurs acutely remains unknown. We measured CoQ10 levels in septic shock patients enrolled in a randomized trial of simvastatin versus placebo.

Methods

We conducted a post hoc analysis of a prospective, randomized trial of simvastatin versus placebo in patients with septic shock (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT00676897). Adult patients with suspected or confirmed infection and the need for vasopressor support were included in the initial trial. For the current analysis, blood specimens were analyzed for plasma CoQ10 and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels. The relationship between CoQ10 levels and inflammatory and vascular endothelial biomarkers was assessed using either the Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficient.

Results

We analyzed 28 samples from 14 patients. CoQ10 levels were low, with a median of 0.49 (interquartile range 0.26 to 0.62) compared to levels in healthy control patients (CoQ10 = 0.95 μmol/L ± 0.29; P < 0.0001). Statin therapy had no effect on plasma CoQ10 levels over time (P = 0.13). There was a statistically significant relationship between plasma CoQ10 levels and levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) (r² = 0.2; P = 0.008), TNF-α (r² = 0.28; P = 0.004), IL-8 (r² = 0.21; P = 0.015), IL-10 (r² = 0.18; P = 0.025), E-selectin (r² = 0.17; P = -0.03), IL-1ra (r² = 0.21; P = 0.014), IL-6 (r² = 0.17; P = 0.029) and IL-2 (r² = 0.23; P = 0.009). After adjusting for LDL levels, there was a statistically significant inverse relationship between plasma CoQ10 levels and levels of VCAM (r² = 0.24; P = 0.01) (Figure 3) and IL-10 (r² = 0.24; P = 0.02).

Conclusions

CoQ10 levels are significantly lower in septic shock patients than in healthy controls. CoQ10 is negatively associated with vascular endothelial markers and inflammatory molecules, though this association diminishes after adjusting for LDL levels.

### Antioxidant vitamins C, E and coenzyme Q10 vs dexamethasone: comparisons of their effects in pulmonary contusion model [^115CpPQy]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary contusion (PC) is the most frequently diagnosed intrathoracic injury related to blunt chest trauma, affecting 17–25% of adult blunt chest trauma patients. It is also an independent risk factor for the development of pneumonia, severe clinical acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The exact mechanisms of PC due to blunt trauma are not yet understood. It may lead to a variety of pathophysiological alterations including inflammation, increased alveolo-capillary permeability, pulmonary oedema, ventilation/perfusion mismatching, increased intrapulmonary shunting, and a loss of compliance. PC is revealed to be related to a progressive inflammatory response mediated by local and systemic immunological alterations. Cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and proteolytic enzymes released from macrophages and leucocytes increase the alveolo- capillary membrane permeability and microvascular leakage. Although the standard treatment options for these patients remain largely supportive, such as supplemental oxygen, cardiopulmonary monitoring, analgesia and pulmonary hygiene, there is accumulating support for treating the activation of a secondary inflammatory response. Early supportive approaches, especially for moderate to severe patients with PC in intensive care units, are very important. To understand and evaluate the inflammatory process, antioxidant-oxidant mechanisms, and the effect of the anti-inflammatory drugs after blunt thorax trauma, many experimental animal trials have been conducted.

Animal experiments and clinical trials have shown that the administration of coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10), which has membrane stabilizing properties and acts as an antioxidant in both mitochondrial and lipid membranes, can inhibit the elevation of serum creatine kinase activity and lipid peroxidation and reduce exercise-induced muscular injuries. Certain vitamins, including vitamin C and vitamin E, are also suggested to have strong free radical scavenging properties. The antioxidant drug Tempol®, antioxidant effectivity N-acetyl cystein (NAC) and dexamethasone (Dxm) were also used in experimental PC models.

The goal of our study was to evaluate the effects of antioxidant vitamins and CoQ 10 in experimental rat models with PC by using isolated blunt thorax trauma and to evaluate the biochemical and histopathological effects by comparing the effects of these antioxidants with the potent anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone.

### Treatment of coenzyme Q10 for 24 weeks improves lipid and glycemic profile in dyslipidemic individuals [^1146cgYa]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The use of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) as an adjuvant treatment with routine clinical therapy against metabolic diseases has shown benefit. However, the effect of CoQ10 as a primary preventive agent against cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) has not been well studied.

Objective

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of CoQ10 on CVD risk factors in dyslipidemic patients.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, 101 dyslipidemic subjects without taking any hypoglycemic or hypolipidemic drugs were administrated to 120 mg CoQ10 or placebo daily for 24 weeks. Anthropometric parameters, lipid and glycemic profile, biomarkers of inflammation, and antioxidant capacity were evaluated before and after 12 and 24 weeks of intervention.

Results

All 101 subjects were included in the analysis. On the 12th week, compared to placebo, CoQ10 supplementation decreased systolic (P = 0.010) and diastolic pressure (P = 0.001) and increased serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC; P = 0.003). On the 24th week, compared to placebo, CoQ10 supplementation further lowered blood pressure and TAC, reduced triglyceride (P = 0.020) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.016), and increased ApoA-I (P < .001) while decreasing homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index (P = 0.009). Adjustment for change of physical activity and energy intake did not alter the effect of CoQ10 on the aforementioned parameters but led to significant decrease of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in CoQ10 group compared to placebo (P = 0.031).

Conclusions

Twenty-four-week treatment of CoQ10 ameliorates multiple CVD risk factors. The versatility and safety of CoQ10 makes it a potential candidate for the primary prevention of CVD.

### Coenzyme Q10 deficiency in septic shock patients [^112HaScJ]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Donnino and colleagues provide new insights into the field of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction during septic shock. These authors suggest a coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) deficiency in patients with septic shock. Larger prospective observational trials measuring CoQ10 in patients with septic shock are required to confirm the possibility of CoQ10 depletion. This study is a new step toward a study testing CoQ10 as a potential therapeutic agent for patients with septic shock.

Description of Included Studies

A total of 868 studies (351 from PubMed, 404 from EMBASE, and 113 from the Cochrane Library) were identified; 231 articles were excluded as duplicated records. After the titles and abstracts of articles were screened, 586 were excluded because of review format, an improper study type, and/or improper comparisons. After the remaining 51 full‐text articles were reviewed, 39 were excluded because of improper comparisons, irrelevant outcomes, and/or unavailable outcomes. Finally, 12 articles 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 21, 22 published in English from 2007 to 2017, with sample sizes ranging from 37 to 76 patients and intervention duration ranging from 30 days to 3 months, were entered into our meta‐analysis (Figure 1, Table). The effect of CoQ10 supplementation on SAMSs was evaluated in 9 RCTs, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and plasma CK was evaluated in 10 RCTs. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, 21, 22 The total number of patients was 575 (294 in the CoQ10 supplementation group and 281 in the placebo group).

### Effects of coenzyme Q10 on statin-induced myopathy: an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1115oCaP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be made available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure because the present article is a systematic review and meta‐analysis; thus, the source data are available for consultation, reproduction, and analysis on web‐based medical libraries.

This study was performed according to the guidelines of the 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analysis statement. 18

Data Source and Search Strategies

Two reviewers (H.Q. and M.G.) searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library with no language restrictions from inception to January 2018 to identify all existing literature. Medical subject headings terms and free‐text terms were used in each database with the following relevant keywords: "coenzyme Q10" and "statin" and "randomized controlled trials". A manual search was also performed to identify relevant references from the selected articles and published reviews. The studies were eligible if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) randomized, controlled, parallel, or crossover trial; (2) the intervention group received statin plus CoQ10, and the comparison group received statin plus placebo; and (3) the outcome involved in the severity of muscle symptoms or plasma CK was available.

Data Extraction and Assessment of Study Quality

Two reviewers (H.Q. and M.G.) extracted data independently. If a disagreement occurred between them, it was resolved by consulting with a third investigator (D.‐z.S.). We would contact the authors if the article was only published with abstracts, and the studies failing to obtain original data were excluded. The data were extracted from each individual eligible study as follows: (1) the first author's name and publication year; (2) intervention duration; (3) inclusion criteria; (4) patient number; (5) patients' age; (6) percentage of men; and (7) clinical outcomes. The methodological quality of eligible studies was determined according to the recommendation of the Cochrane Handbook. 19

### Coenzyme Q10 levels are low and may be associated with the inflammatory cascade in septic shock [^112DQU56]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design

We conducted a post hoc analysis of a prospective, randomized trial of septic shock patients admitted to an urban university teaching hospital (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT00676897). The initial trial was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center trial of the effect of statin therapy for patients with septic shock. Patients enrolled in the trial were given either 40 mg of simvastatin or placebo once daily for a maximum of seven days or until hospital discharge, whichever came first. The primary outcome for the initial trial was the time until shock reversal with a secondary outcome of attenuation of the inflammatory cascade following intervention. The current post hoc analysis was performed using clinical and inflammatory biomarker data collected from the patients who were included in the initial trial. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

Study setting and population

All patients who presented to our urban university teaching hospital with suspected or confirmed infection were considered for enrollment. Patients were screened by trained research assistants using the hospital's electronic medical record system in the emergency department and ICUs. Inclusion criteria for the initial trial consisted of adult patients (age > 18 years) with two or more of the four systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria, suspected or confirmed infection (pneumonia, sepsis, pyelonephritis, and so on) and evidence of shock (defined as the use of vasopressor medication for a minimum of one hour). Exclusion criteria consisted of statin or digoxin use upon presentation, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels more than three times the upper limit of normal or creatine phosphokinase level more than four times the upper limit of normal. Patients were also excluded if they did not require vasopressor support. Healthy controls were enrolled if they met the inclusion criteria of age > 18 years and no acute medical or surgical problems that would require hospital admission. Controls were excluded if they had any significant comorbid disease. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients or their designated surrogates prior to any research intervention.

Interventions

All patients received standard medical therapy for the treatment of the underlying infection as determined by the clinical team. The initial randomized trial included provision of either simvastatin 40 mg or placebo once daily for a maximum of seven days or until hospital discharge, whichever occurred first. Patients included in the post hoc analysis were assessed for clinical and biomarker data, including levels of CoQ10 and plasma LDL as well as vascular endothelial and inflammatory markers.

### Ubiquinol (reduced coenzyme Q10) in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot trial [^113WVzZ9]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

The timing and duration of our intervention may have influenced the results. Approximately half of our patients were mechanically ventilated and comatose at the time of enrollment, which led to some delay in the administration of the first dose as consent had to be obtained from a legally authorized surrogate. The duration of therapy was relatively short (maximum of seven days), and a longer duration and follow-up period may be needed, especially for long-term patient-centered outcomes. For example, ubiquinol could theoretically protect against cognitive dysfunction or muscular weakness post-septic shock, but we did not measure these longer-term outcomes. Further, the majority of our biomarker endpoints were only assessed within the first 24 h. It is possible that changes could have been seen if the endpoints were evaluated at later time points. The enrolled patient population was heterogeneous, with a relatively low overall mortality (16%) that, based on review by a blinded physician, was mainly related to withdrawal of care in patients with underlying terminal illness. Future studies might consider excluding patients with terminal illness. Whether certain subgroups, such as a more acutely ill population with potential signs of mitochondrial injury (for example, elevated lactate), may benefit remains unknown. Lastly, the possibility remains that ubiquinol is ineffective as a 'metabolic resuscitator' in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. However, additional studies are needed before any firm conclusions can be made.

### Antioxidant vitamins C, E and coenzyme Q10 vs dexamethasone: comparisons of their effects in pulmonary contusion model [^116nxehB]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

PC is the most frequently diagnosed injury due to blunt thorax trauma. Because approximately 1/3 of trauma patients admitted to hospitals have thorax trauma, it is an important cause of mortality and morbidity. About 25% of the patients require invasive mechanical ventilation. With the development of possible new pharmacological agents and better resuscitation methods, the need for mechanical ventilation may be decreased and the prognosis of patients with PC may improve. For studying PC, various blunt thorax trauma models have been previously established. The local and systemic pathophysiological consequences of PC and the different treatment strategies to minimize the effects of this type of injury have been studied.

In our study, we used the rat model of lung contusion injury caused by external blunt thoracic trauma as described by Raghavendran et al. We generated and adapted the rat model mentioned above in order to constitute a moderate PC.

The effects of the PC depend on the extent of the injury. Direct injury causes pulmonary vascular damage with secondary alveolar haemorrhage, and thus the alveoli are poorly perfused. Afterwards, tissue inflammation develops and results in surrounding pulmonary oedema that leads to regional alterations in compliance and airway resistance causing V/Q mismatch. This manifests as a progressive deterioration of pulmonary gas exchange and P/F ratios. Similar previous studies have been conducted to assess the severity of pulmonary shunting and arterial oxygenation in injured rats, revealing severe hypoxia early after induction of contusion. Although it was observed that arterial oxygenation was improved over time, levels persisted at the range of acute lung injury for 4–24 h following contusion. In our study, all PaO 2 levels were decreased, and all PaCO 2 levels were increased significantly at 6 h after contusion. We detected slight improvement in both PaO 2 and PaCO 2 levels due to the early administration of antioxidant vitamins (vitamin C, vitamin E), CoQ 10 and Dxm. PC is associated with a leukocyte-mediated secondary inflammatory response leading to capillary leaking, interstitial oedema and protein extravasation. Strohmaier et al. clearly demonstrated the importance of neutrophil influx in mediating lung injury. Alveolar levels of pro-inflammatory mediators like interleukins and TNF have been shown to rise precipitously after blunt lung injury. It has been elucidated that PC is associated with a progressive inflammatory response mediated by local and systemic immunological alterations. Macrophages and neutrophils, which are potentially involved in the inflammatory process, are activated after blunt trauma. Cytokines, reactive oxygen metabolites, and proteolytic enzymes are released by both leukocytes and macrophages.

### Coenzyme Q10 levels are low and may be associated with the inflammatory cascade in septic shock [^116pLyeZ]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Previous research studies have demonstrated that inflammatory cytokines and vascular endothelial markers are abnormally elevated in septic shock, indicating both inflammation and activation of the vascular endothelium. Within septic patients, elevation of these biomarkers has been associated with worse outcomes. We found a statistically significant association between CoQ10 levels and VCAM and IL-10; whether the relationship is causal remains unknown. However, CoQ10 treatment in other diseases, such as breast cancer, did show that provision of the compound ultimately resulted in a lowering of biomarkers, thus supporting a causal relationship.

The finding of abnormally low CoQ10 levels is consistent with the expected pathophysiology in septic shock. Since LDL is the primary transport molecule for CoQ10 in plasma, we measured LDL levels and found that these levels were low, which is in agreement with reports in the literature on lipoprotein variations in sepsis and septic shock. The decrease in the carrier may lead to depletion of CoQ10. In addition, CoQ10 is partially provided by diet, and patients with critical illness often have nutritional deficiencies for multiple reasons. Furthermore, through a series of complex biochemical reactions, CoQ10 is synthesized endogenously from a number of components, including mevalonate and tyrosine as well as vitamins B 2, B 9, B 12 and C. Patients in septic shock have deficiencies in micronutrients, including B vitamins, and since CoQ10 in the body is primarily derived from endogenous production, metabolic dysfunction leading to decreased production and/or increased utilization is more likely to account for CoQ10 depletion identified in this study. Regardless of etiology, identifying low CoQ10 levels in patients with septic shock is significant, as the compound is essential to mitochondrial function and may play an important role in the pathophysiology of mitochondrial dysfunction in sepsis. In contrast to previous investigations of mitochondrial dysfunction, our finding that CoQ10 is low in sepsis opens the potential for future therapeutic interventions, as CoQ10 can be administered exogenously.

### Effects of CoQ10 supplementation on lipid profiles and glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1121EHkf]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Beyond certain medical treatments, food diets and supplementation plays a key role in the management of chronic diseases and promoting health status of human beings in the 21th century. Previous studies have shown that the dysfunction of endothelium caused by oxidative stress and inflammation resulted from hyperglycemia is the key factor in the incidence and development of vascular complications of diabetes; Hence antioxidants intake is an appropriate intervention to improve this condition.

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), a kind of benzoquinone, also known as ubiquinone, is a vitamin like antioxidant that can be synthesized in the body and is found in all biologic membranes. Also it is a vital component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain that has an intermittent role in ATP production. Moreover, this ubiquinone may cause regeneration of reduced forms of vitamin E and C and it shows stronger antioxidant properties than vitamin E. In addition, CoQ10 can protect the lipids of membranes and blood circulation against peroxidation.

Research investment toward discovering appropriate supplements in complementary medicine has a high importance for optimal management of patient with diabetes. Studies have shown that amongst the clinical supported supplements, Q10 supplements are one of the most popular ones that might be valuable in the management of neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases,-.

The importance of this supplementation in inherited diabetes is well known -. It has been shown that the serum concentrations of Coenzyme Q10 are reduced in patient with diabetes. Regarding the benefits of Q10 supplementation shown in animal studies,- and controversial findings of human trials,-, this study was conducted to evaluate the effects of Q10 supplementation on lipid profiles and glycemic control in type 2 patients with diabetes.

### Effect of coenzyme Q10 supplementation on statin-induced myalgias [^114aynnR]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) deficiency has been proposed to be causal in 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin)-induced myopathies. However, the clinical benefit of supplementation is unproved. The purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of CoQ10 supplementation on myalgias presumed to be caused by statins. Patients currently receiving a statin who developed new-onset myalgias in ≥ 2 extremities within 60 days of initiation or a dosage increase were eligible. Patients continued statin therapy and were randomized using a matched design to either CoQ10 60 mg twice daily or matching placebo. Double-blind treatment continued for 3 months, and patients completed a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) and the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire at baseline and at each monthly visit. The primary end point was the comparison of the VAS score at 1 month. A total of 76 patients were enrolled (40 in the CoQ10 arm and 36 in the placebo arm). The mean VAS score was 6 cm at baseline in both groups. At 1 month, no difference was seen in the mean VAS score between the 2 groups (3.9 cm in the CoQ10 group and 4 cm in the placebo group; p = 0.97). However, 5 patients in the CoQ10 group and 3 in the placebo group discontinued therapy during the first month because of myalgias. The baseline median score on the Sensory Pain Rating Index subscale was 10 in the CoQ10 group and 11.5 in the placebo group. At 1 month, these scores had decreased to 6.5 and 7.5, respectively, with no statistically significant difference (p = 0.34). In conclusion, CoQ10 did not produce a greater response than placebo in the treatment of presumed statin-induced myalgias.

### Effects of CoQ10 supplementation on lipid profiles and glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115Bupp6]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Low grade inflammation and oxidative stress are the key factors in the pathogenesis and development of diabetes and its complications. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is known as an antioxidant and has a vital role in generation of cellular energy providing. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of CoQ10 supplementation on lipid profiles and glycemic controls in patients with diabetes.

Methods

Fifty patients with diabetes were randomly allocated into two groups to receive either 150 mg CoQ10 or placebo daily for 12 weeks. Before and after supplementation, fasting venous blood samples were collected and lipid profiles containing triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and glycemic indices comprising of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin and hemoglobin A 1 C (HbA 1 C) were measured. Insulin resistance was calculated using HOMA-IR index.

Results

Forty patients completed the study. After intervention FPG and HbA 1 C were significantly lower in the CoQ10 group compared to the placebo group, but there were no significant differences in serum insulin and HOMA-IR between the two groups. Although total cholesterol did not change in the Q10 group after supplementation, triglyceride and HDL-C significantly decreased and LDL-C significantly increased in the CoQ10 group.

Conclusion

The present study showed that treatment with Q10 may improve glycemic control with no favorable effects on lipid profiles in type 2 patients with diabetes.

### Mitochondrial dysfunction in obesity: potential benefit and mechanism of Co-enzyme Q10 supplementation in metabolic syndrome [^113tqpJ1]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Co-enzyme Q10 (Co-Q10) is an essential component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Most cells are sensitive to co-enzyme Q10 (Co-Q10) deficiency. This deficiency has been implicated in several clinical disorders such as heart failure, hypertension, Parkinson's disease and obesity. The lipid lowering drug statin inhibits conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate and lowers plasma Co-Q10 concentrations. However, supplementation with Co-Q10 improves the pathophysiological condition of statin therapy. Recent evidence suggests that Co-Q10 supplementation may be useful for the treatment of obesity, oxidative stress and the inflammatory process in metabolic syndrome. The anti-inflammatory response and lipid metabolizing effect of Co-Q10 is probably mediated by transcriptional regulation of inflammation and lipid metabolism. This paper reviews the evidence showing beneficial role of Co-Q10 supplementation and its potential mechanism of action on contributing factors of metabolic and cardiovascular complications.

### Ubiquinol (reduced coenzyme Q10) in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot trial [^111am6gh]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Previous studies have demonstrated a beneficial role of CoQ10 as a co-adjutant in the treatment of syndromes characterized by impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics and increased oxidative stress. CoQ10 has shown beneficial effects on diastolic and systolic function in patients with chronic heart failure and, in a single-center pilot trial, CoQ10 was found to increase three-month survival when given to post-cardiac arrest patients. Moreover CoQ10 has shown promising clinical benefits in small human studies of progressive supranuclear palsy, Huntington's disease, and Friedreich's ataxia. Finally, CoQ10 has also been studied in Parkinson's disease, with inconsistent results.

In the current study we were unable to detect any differences in secondary endpoints between the groups. There are multiple possible explanations for this lack of effect. Our sample size was relatively small, and we may have been underpowered to detect clinically relevant differences in biomarkers or clinical outcomes. A relatively large portion of potentially eligible patients were excluded, which may decrease the generalizability of our findings. Given the lack of human trials in septic patients, we used a relatively low dose (200 mg twice per day). Previous studies have demonstrated that oral consumption of CoQ10 at dosages of 400, 600, 800, and 1,200 mg per day are well tolerated in patients with Parkinson's disease, with the greatest benefit in the group receiving the highest dosage (1,200 mg per day). As such, our dose may have been inadequate to show a treatment effect, and higher doses of ubiquinol may be required to compensate for the severity of metabolic dysfunction and energy depletion that occurs in severe sepsis and septic shock.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^112ERkWf]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and nutraceuticals in statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) — guidance: Use of CoQ10 is not supported by most guideline recommendations for mitigation of SAMS, and until a well-designed RCT is completed in those with SAMS and low levels of CoQ10, such a strategy cannot be currently recommended. Nutraceuticals should not be promoted to replace pharmaceutical grade, evidenced-based, lipid-lowering therapies; however, they may have a niche role as complementary to statins and non-statins in some statin intolerant patients.

### Co-enzyme Q10 supplementation for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^114WY5wZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the number one cause of death and disability worldwide and public health interventions focus on modifiable risk factors, such as diet. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an antioxidant that is naturally synthesised by the body and can also be taken as a dietary supplement. Studies have shown that a CoQ10 deficiency is associated with cardiovascular disease.

Objectives

To determine the effects of coenzyme Q10 supplementation as a single ingredient for the primary prevention of CVD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2013, Issue 11); MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to November week 3 2013); EMBASE (Ovid, 1947 to 27 November 2013) and other relevant resources on 2 December 2013. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) lasting at least three months involving healthy adults or those at high risk of CVD but without a diagnosis of CVD. Trials investigated the supplementation of CoQ10 alone as a single supplement. The comparison group was no intervention or placebo. The outcomes of interest were CVD clinical events and major CVD risk factors, adverse effects and costs. We excluded any trials involving multifactorial lifestyle interventions to avoid confounding.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted authors for additional information where necessary.

Main Results

We identified six RCTs with a total of 218 participants randomised, one trial awaiting classification and five ongoing trials. All trials were conducted in participants at high risk of CVD, two trials examined CoQ10 supplementation alone and four examined CoQ10 supplementation in patients on statin therapy; we analysed these separately. All six trials were small-scale, recruiting between 20 and 52 participants; one trial was at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data and one for selective reporting; all studies were unclear in the method of allocation and therefore for selection bias. The dose of CoQ10 varied between 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day and the duration of the interventions was similar at around three months. No studies reported mortality or non-fatal cardiovascular events. None of the included studies provided data on adverse events. Two trials examined the effect of CoQ10 on blood pressure. For systolic blood pressure we did not perform a meta-analysis due to significant heterogeneity. In one trial CoQ10 supplementation had no effect on systolic blood pressure (mean difference (MD) -1.90 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -13.17 to 9.37, 51 patients randomised). In the other trial there was a statistically significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (MD -15.00 mmHg, 95% CI -19.06 to -10.94, 20 patients randomised). For diastolic blood pressure we performed a random-effects meta-analysis, which showed no evidence of effect of CoQ10 supplementation when these two small trials were pooled (MD -1.62 mmHg, 95% CI -5.2 to 1.96). One trial (51 patients randomised) looked at the effect of CoQ10 on lipid levels. The trial showed no evidence of effect of CoQ10 supplementation on total cholesterol (MD 0.30 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.70), high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (MD 0.02 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.17) or triglycerides (MD 0.05 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.52). Of the four trials that investigated CoQ10 supplementation in patients on statin therapy, three of them showed that simultaneous administration of CoQ10 did not significantly influence lipid levels or systolic blood pressure levels between the two groups. The fourth trial showed a significant increase in the change in total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol at three months across the four arms of the trial (α-tocopherol, CoQ10, CoQ10 + α-tocopherol and placebo), however the way in which the data were presented meant that we were unable to determine if there was any significant difference between the CoQ10 only and placebo arms. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the change in HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides after three months between the four arms of the trial.

Authors' Conclusions

There are very few studies to date examining CoQ10 for the primary prevention of CVD. The results from the ongoing studies will add to the evidence base. Due to the small number of underpowered trials contributing to the analyses, the results presented should be treated with caution and further high quality trials with longer-term follow-up are needed to determine the effects on cardiovascular events.

### Effects of coenzyme Q10 on statin-induced myopathy: an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115LoB6v]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Meta‐Analysis

Nine RCTs 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 (222 patients in the CoQ10 supplementation group versus 211 patients in the placebo group) evaluated the effect of CoQ10 supplementation on SAMSs. Compared with the placebo, CoQ10 supplementation ameliorated muscle pain (WMD, −1.60; 95% CI, −1.75 to −1.44; P < 0.001), muscle weakness (WMD, −2.28; 95% CI, −2.79 to −1.77; P = 0.006), muscle cramps (WMD, −1.78; 95% CI, −2.31 to −1.24; P < 0.001), and muscle tiredness (WMD, −1.75; 95% CI, −2.31 to −1.19; P < 0.001) from the results of the fixed‐effect model (Figure 3). To ensure the reliability of the outcome, the analysis using a randomized effect model was also performed, and the results showed that CoQ10 supplementation ameliorated muscle pain (WMD, −1.46; 95% CI, −2.16 to −0.76; P < 0.001) and muscle weakness (WMD, −2.54; 95% CI, −4.07 to −1.01; P = 0.006) (Figure 4). A significant heterogeneity for the outcome of muscle pain was observed (I² = 89.6%, P < 0.001) (Figures 3 and 4), which had no obvious correlation with administration doses of CoQ10 (exp, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99–1.01; adjusted R² = −12.33%; P = 0.79), CoQ10 supplementation time (exp, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.96–1.04; adjusted R² = −23.96%; P = 0.98), or year of publication (exp, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.85–1.55; adjusted R² = 2.57%; P = 0.31) (Figure 5 A through 5 C).

### The treatment of primary CoQ deficiency requires the targeting of multiple pathogenic mechanisms [^115J8fT7]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Moreover, our results in human fibroblasts with COQ7 mutations provide important translational insights. The superior efficacy of the co-treatment compared to individual therapies suggests that combining both compounds, with complementary mechanisms of action, might also be an effective therapeutic strategy for other mitochondrial disorders that occur with disruption in sulfide metabolism, unbalanced 1 C pathways, or decreased CoQ 10 levels. Nevertheless, additional studies using models with different molecular defects must be conducted.

Conclusions

The co-administration of CoQ 10 and VA offers a promising therapeutic strategy for mitochondrial disorders, particularly for mitochondrial encephalopathies due to CoQ deficiency, demonstrating enhanced efficacy over individual treatments by modulating tissue-specific CoQ metabolism, improving mitochondrial bioenergetics, and reducing neuroinflammation. The success of this approach underscores the importance of considering multiple therapeutic targets in treating mitochondrial diseases and provides a base for future clinical investigations.

### Senescent macrophages induce ferroptosis in skeletal muscle and accelerate osteoarthritis-related muscle atrophy [^115D4qf7]. Nature Aging (2025). High credibility.

Muscle atrophy around joints is a common issue for people with osteoarthritis (OA), but its causes are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that chronic inflammation in quadriceps muscle coincides with OA in mice, characterized by an increase in macrophages, activation of inflammatory pathways and tissue vascularization. We show that, during OA progression, macrophages progressively exhibit increasing phenotypes of senescence and promote muscle atrophy through paracrine induction of ferroptosis. Mechanistically, iron overload-induced mitochondrial damage results in reduced asparagine metabolites, impairing coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) synthesis by inhibiting mTORC1-HMGCR signaling. Ultimately, this cascade enhances lipid peroxidation and promotes ferroptosis in skeletal muscle cells. We show that the cardiac medication CoQ10 can attenuate muscle atrophy by inhibiting ferroptosis, thereby reducing pathological damage to OA joints. Our findings offer insights for the potential management of muscle atrophy in patients with OA.

### Coenzyme Q10 [^115uvcK1]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Coenzyme Q10 is a vitamin-like substance used in the treatment of a variety of disorders primarily related to suboptimal cellular energy metabolism and oxidative injury. Studies supporting the efficacy of coenzyme Q10 appear most promising for neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and certain encephalomyopathies for which coenzyme Q10 has gained orphan drug status. Results in other areas of research, induding treatment of congestive heart failure and diabetes, appear to be contradictory or need further clarification before proceeding with recommendations. Coenzyme Q10 appears to be a safe supplement with minimal side effects and low drug interaction potential.

### Antioxidant vitamins C, E and coenzyme Q10 vs dexamethasone: comparisons of their effects in pulmonary contusion model [^11354Nzu]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

CoQ10, a component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, is a strong antioxidant that plays a role in membrane stabilization. Antioxidants inhibit lipid peroxidation by preventing a peroxidation chain reaction and/or picking up reactive oxygen derivatives. Endogenous antioxidants include mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase, SOD, catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione S-transferase, hydroperoxidase and CoQ. CoQ10 is the only antioxidant that is fat-soluble, synthesized endogenously and is present in tissues in active form (reduced) independently from diet. It has been found in experimental studies that CoQ10 is effective in the treatment of ischemia reperfusion injury. Portakal et al. found that CoQ10 has beneficial effects in the rat liver ischemia-reperfusion damage. Similary, Ostrowski et al. suggested that CoQ 10 has beneficial effects in cerebral ischemia. They also reported that CoQ 10 reduced the cerebral ischemic lesion diameter in an animal model. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of CoQ 10 in a trauma model has not been thoroughly studied. Kerimoglu et al. has demonstrated that CoQ10 administration was beneficial after spinal cord trauma. Tran et al. showed that pretreatment with Tempol® or CoQ10 decreased superoxide production, reduced the infarct size and normalized mitochondrial dysfunction in the gastrocnemius muscle after tourniquet-induced acute ischemia- reperfusion injury in mouse skeletal muscles. However, CoQ 10 administration after lung injury in animal models has very rarely been studied. Lim et al. demonstrated that CoQ 10 reduced the increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) and the injury-induced rise in peak airway pressure following lung injury models in rats. They concluded that CoQ 10 may have a protective role in lung injury. They demonstrated that a high-dose of oral CoQ 10 was well incorporated into plasma and lung tissue and, to a lesser extent, into the heart. Having shown that oral administration of CoQ 10 provided substantial increases in plasma and lung tissue concentrations, the authors tested the benefits of these increases using an in situ lung injury model that incorporated physiological and biochemical measurements used by transplant clinicians to assess the function of the donor lung. The lung ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) model demonstrated both increased peak airway pressure, poor gas exchange and increased levels of TNFα. In this novel study of the effects of CoQ 10 pre-dosing on lung IRI, there is evidence that oral administration of CoQ 10 significantly attenuated the rise in cytokine TNFα but not IL-6, MDA and ATP. However, it did not provide sufficient clinical protection against IRI as judged by peak airway pressure and oxygen diffusion gradients. However, there is no study evaluating the role of CoQ 10 in a blunt chest trauma model. In our study, comparisons of MDA, SOD and NO levels measured after early administration of CoQ 10 in experimental rat models were statistically significant. The serum MDA levels of the group that received CoQ 10 were closest to the group I. These findings are similar to the previously published data studying the antioxidant properties of CoQ 10. Vitamin C is capable of scavenging oxygen-derived free radicals that are involved in the development or exacerbation of various diseases, including cancer, heart attack, arthritis and stroke. Omeroglu et al. administrated high doses of vitamin C to rat models with ruptured Achilles tendons and showed that a high dose vitamin C supplementation has positive effects on tendon healing by promoting early angiogenesis and increased collagen synthesis. Cristante et al. demonstrated that vitamin C reduces the inflammatory response after spinal cord injury in rats. Additionally, Liao et al. showed that early administration of vitamin C is effective for treating spinal cord injury in rats.

### Decreased coenzyme Q10 concentration in plasma of children with cystic fibrosis [^116ijJoS]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an effective lipophilic antioxidant and protects against lipid peroxidation by scavenging radicals. Patients with cystic fibrosis generally have fat malabsorption; thus, we hypothesized that overall plasma CoQ10 concentration in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis might be diminished. Because these patients have increased oxidative stress due to chronic pulmonary inflammation, we also assumed that the oxidized form of CoQ10 might be relatively increased.

Patients and Methods

The total plasma CoQ10 levels and the oxidized and reduced form were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography in 30 children with cystic fibrosis (mean FEV1% predicted = 88.5% ± 18.7%) and 30 age-matched controls.

Results

Total plasma CoQ10 levels were significantly lower in the cystic fibrosis group as compared with the control group (0.87 ± 0.42 micromol/L and 1.35 ± 0.39 micromol/L, respectively; P < 0.001). When correcting for the lower serum cholesterol level in patients with cystic fibrosis, this difference remained significant: the CoQ10/cholesterol ratio (micromol/mol) was 268.8 ± 136.7 and 334.0 ± 102.9 in patients and controls, respectively (P < 0.05). However, the CoQ10 redox status was identical in patients and controls (86.4% ± 7.1% and 85.4% ± 7.3%, respectively).

Conclusions

We found that the overall plasma CoQ10 concentration is lower in patients with cystic fibrosis, probably because of fat malabsorption. The CoQ10 redox status was not disturbed, indicating that CoQ10 could still be adequately regenerated in this group of patients with cystic fibrosis with mild-to-moderate pulmonary disease.

### Immunometabolism in the aging heart [^113Ystpu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Another mitochondria‐targeted synthetic tetrapeptide, elamipretide, also known as bendavia, has emerged as a mitochondria‐specific therapeutic that has been shown to restore mitochondrial bioenergetics by targeting cardiolipin and accumulating in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Elamipretide has been shown to reduce the generation of mitochondrial ROS and optimize ATP synthesis and mitochondrial electron transport thereby preventing cardiac pathologies. Additionally, elamipretide has also been in several clinical trials for acute and chronic cardiac events (EMBRACE [Evaluation of Myocardial Effects of MTP‐131 for Reducing Reperfusion Injury in Patients With Acute Coronary Events], NCT01572909; A Study to Evaluate the Effects of 4 Weeks Treatment With Subcutaneous Elamipretide on Left Ventricular Function in Subjects With Stable Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction, NCT02814097; Effect of Elamipretide on Left Ventricular Function in Subjects With Stable Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction, NCT02788747; A Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Cardiac and Renal Effects of Short Term Treatment With Elamipretide in Patients Hospitalized With Congestion Due to Heart Failure, NCT02914665; A Study Investigating the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of MTP‐131 in Subjects With Congestive Heart Failure, NCT02388464) and mitochondrial disorders (MMPOWER [Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of MTP‐131 for the Treatment of Mitochondrial Myopathy], NCT02367014). The highly lipophilic quinone, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), or ubiquinone, is a potent antioxidant that has been shown to facilitate mitochondrial‐associated ATP production. In addition to serving as an electron carrier in the mitochondria, the anti‐inflammatory role of CoQ10 is attributed to its ability to repress inflammatory gene expression, thereby improving immune function. Preclinical data demonstrate a pathophysiological role for CoQ10 in heart failure and other cardiovascular events with improved outcomes following CoQ10 supplementation. CoQ10 has been in clinical trials for > 30 years as an intervention for cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure (PANDA [Protective Effect of CoQ10 Against Negative Inflammatory Response and Organ Dysfunction in Cardiovascular Surgery], NCT04444349) and coronary artery disease (Coenzyme Q10 in Relation of the Lipid Peroxidation, Antioxidant Enzyme Activities in Coronary Artery Disease Patients, NCT01163500).

### Effect of coenzyme Q10 on statin-associated myalgia and adherence to statin therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111K83pW]. Atherosclerosis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Statin associated muscle symptoms are common and affect adherence to statin treatment. The objective of this study was to assess whether patients with statin-associated myalgia can be successfully treated with Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) to improve symptoms and maintain them on statin therapy.

Methods

This systematic review was performed in line with the 2015 PRISMA statement. Relevant studies were identified via a search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. Studies were screened to include randomised controlled trials of oral CoQ10 supplementation versus a placebo in adults with statin-associated myalgia. Continuation of statin therapy was a secondary outcome. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Pooled and sensitivity analyses were performed.

Results

413 records were identified by the search strategy. Eight studies were selected for review, and 7 of them (with 321 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Selected studies were published between 2007 and 2016 with the number of participants ranging from 37 to 76. Only two of these studies demonstrated a positive effect of CoQ10 therapy in relieving muscle pain. The meta-analysis did not demonstrate any benefit of CoQ10 supplementation in improving myalgia symptoms compared to placebo (weighted mean difference -0.42; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] -1.47 to 0.62). Similarly, CoQ10 did not improve the proportion of patients remaining on the statin treatment (RR 0.99; 95%CI, 0.81 to 1.20).

Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis did not demonstrate that CoQ10 supplementation was beneficial for patients with statin-associated muscle pain or improved adherence to statin therapy.

### Ubiquinol (reduced coenzyme Q10) in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot trial [^113RnbBf]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical outcomes

There was no difference in ICU length of stay (5 (3 to 7) versus 3 (2 to 6) days, P = 0.30) or hospital length of stay (11 (6 to 19) days versus 10 (6 to 19) days, P = 0.82) between the two groups. These results were similar when only analyzing survivors. There was no difference in in-hospital mortality between patients receiving ubiquinol versus placebo (4 (21%) versus 2 (11%), P = 0.66). The four deaths in the ubiquinol group happened 1, 1, 5, and 16 days after the drug administration. The mode of death was determined to be comorbid withdrawal of care in two patients with underlying terminal illness, refractory hypotension in one patient with underlying terminal illness, and progressive respiratory failure in one patient with underlying alcohol-associated hepatic failure. The mode of death for the two patients in the placebo group was determined as comorbid withdrawal of care in one patient with terminal illness, and refractory hypotension in one patient with underlying terminal illness (both deaths occurred four days after drug administration). As noted, the majority of deaths occurred in patients with a preexisting terminal illness, including metastatic cancer or end-stage organ failure. None of the deaths were determined to be related to the study medication as assessed by an independent data safety monitoring board. Gastrointestinal disturbance, potentially related to ubiquinol administration, was reported in one patient.

### The impact of coenzyme qon metabolic and cardiovascular disease profiles in diabetic patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112uwaQB]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Heart failure remains the leading cause of death in diabetic patients, when compared to their nondiabetic counterparts. 1 A combination of metabolic abnormalities is acknowledged to be responsible for enhanced susceptibility of diabetic individuals to myocardial damage. For example, in type 2 diabetes (T2D), the predominant form of diabetes that is associated with dyslipidaemia and enhanced arterial atherosclerotic buildup has been directly connected with endothelial dysfunction and subsequent increased risk of heart failure. 1, 2, 3, 4 The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidaemia include elevated plasma triglyceride and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations, and reduced high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Such complications may arise due to increased free fatty acid flux secondary to insulin resistance and can greatly impair myocardial contractility, which eventually leads to reduced cardiac efficiency. 5, 6 Currently, of major concern has been the limited capacity of available therapies to protect diabetic patients against the rising cardiovascular disease (CVD)‐related comorbidities.

Although currently used therapies like statins can control dyslipidaemic complications, their long‐term use has been associated with reduced endogenous levels of ubiquinone or coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ10). 7, 8 In fact, it has been established that a diabetic heart already displays significantly reduced endogenous CoQ10 levels, when compared to the nondiabetic counterpart. 9 This may further explain the continued rise in CVD‐related deaths in diabetic patients since CoQ10 is known to act as an important antioxidant to protect against dyslipidaemia‐induced oxidative stress and inflammation, 10, 11 some of the major consequences implicated in enhanced diabetes‐induced myocardial damage. Beyond its antioxidant properties, CoQ10 remains a crucial component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain that plays an essential role in facilitating the production of adenosine triphosphate through its involvement in redox reactions. 12 Consistently, administration of CoQ10 has been correlated with improved endothelial function in patients with and without established CVDs. 10

Despite an increase in the number of studies reporting on the beneficial effects of CoQ10 supplementation in improving endothelial function in humans, 10 available evidence remains inconclusive regarding its impact on improving CVD outcomes in those with diabetes. Thus, this systematic review and meta‐analysis updates our current understanding on the cardio‐protective effects of CoQ10, using data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in the last five years.

### Non-pharmacological approaches for migraine [^111VCh6h]. Neurotherapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Similarly to riboflavin, coenzyme Q10 has an essential role in the mitochondrial electron transport chain and energy metabolism. In migraine, it has shown efficacy in one randomized controlled trial to date in which 42 migraine patients received either placebo or a 300-mg daily dose of CoQ10. The treatment group showed a more pronounced (p = 0.05) reduction in attack frequency from baseline to month 4 with respect to placebo, and the product was generally well tolerated. In another RCT on 50 migraine children and adolescents, CoQ10 was given at the dose of 100 mg per day and compared to placebo, showing no difference between the two groups. More evidence will be needed therefore to support the widespread use of CoQ10 as a preventive treatment.

Previous studies have highlighted a reduction of magnesium levels in migraine; these observations lead to the hypothesis of a consequent neuronal hyperexcitability in the migranous brain, given the role of this compound in inhibiting glutamate expression through NMDA receptor binding. Oral magnesium has been systematically studied as a preventive treatment for migraine in five randomized controlled trials. The first study, performed by Facchinetti et al. assessed the effect of 360 mg oral magnesium in menstrual migraine compared to placebo in 20 subjects. Both the treatment and placebo group had a significant decrease in migraine frequencies and pain scores with respect to baseline; therefore, magnesium did not prove more effective than placebo with regard to these outcome measures. However, the active group showed significantly reduced pain scores respect to placebo after treatment. Limitations of this study include its small case number and the fact that it was only conducted in women. In a multicenter German study carried out in 43 migraineurs with or without aura, a daily dose of 600 mg magnesium was compared to placebo. The study was designed as a crossover trial in which the 2-month treatment was interchanged. Interestingly, a significant reduction in attack frequency was demonstrated only in the placebo-verum sequence and not in the verum-placebo one, possibly because of a carry-over effect of magnesium due to the absence of a wash-out period in between treatments. Pfaffenrath and colleagues compared magnesium 486 mg daily to placebo in a study involving 69 migraine without aura patients, finding no statistically significant difference in headache days. On the other hand, Peikert et al. compared magnesium 600 mg to placebo in 68 total migraineurs and found significantly decreased attack frequency, duration and intensity in the active group. Finally, a study by Koseoglu on 40 migraineurs without aura showed a significant decrease in attack frequency in the group treated with 600 mg daily magnesium, although a reduction could also be seen in the placebo group. This study however had a net disproportion between group sizes, with 30 patients receiving magnesium and 10 placebo. In conclusion, there is limited evidence to suggest that magnesium constitutes an effective preventive treatment for migraine patients.

### Effects of coenzyme Q10 supplementation on glycemic control: a GRADE-assessed systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116wf77x]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 2
GRADE Evidence Profile for effect of CoQ10 supplementation on glycemic control.

Meta-analysis of data from 44 treatment arms suggested a significant reduction in fasting glucose level following CoQ10 supplementation (WMD: -5.22 mg/dl; 95% CI: -8.33, -2.11 mg/dl; P < 0.001; n = 2157 in 38 studies; I² = 95.10%) (Figure 2). Subgroup analysis of potentially modifying factors revealed that the most prominent effects on efficacy and heterogeneity were due to CoQ10 dosage, duration, the type of control, risk of bias, and industry funding (Table 3). The impact of CoQ10 on fasting glucose was greater at supplemental doses < 200 mg/day (WMD: -13.21 mg/dl, 95% CI: -18.43, -7.98 mg/dl, P < 0.001) compared with remaining two groups. With respect to treatment duration, the effect of CoQ10 on reducing fasting glucose level was better in the subsets of duration ≥ 12 weeks (WMD: -7.59 mg/dl, 95% CI: -11.66, -3.52 mg/dl, P < 0.001) compared with duration < 12 weeks. As for the type of control, the reduction on fasting glucose was greater at placebo group (WMD: -6.02 mg/dl, 95% CI: -9.56, -2.47 mg/dl, P < 0.001) rather than using other controls. CoQ10 had better efficacy in reducing fasting glucose level in the low risk of bias (WMD: -6.70 mg/dl, 95% CI: -11.28, -2.13 mg/dl, P < 0.001) and not receiving industry funding (WMD: -6.84 mg/dl, 95% CI: -10.70, -2.98 mg/dl, P < 0.001).

### Pain reduction and improved vascular health associated with daily consumption of an anti-inflammatory dietary supplement blend [^113CGPQL]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The study presented here took a novel approach to low-risk approach to pain management and also evaluated whether this could have secondary beneficial effects on cardiovascular health and reduction of inflammation. The study combined pain scores with functional changes. Importantly, the total lower daily dose was more effective than the higher daily dose; the data suggest that the once-daily dose provided more robust support of reducing pain and inflammation than the higher dose split into two smaller doses. That said, the limitations of the study were its small size and lack of a placebo control. A placebo effect may have had some contribution to the observed pain reduction, and a larger placebo-controlled study size, using a one-dose regimen, which appears to ideally be 3 capsules daily, is warranted. Such further clinical evaluation should examine the effects of DSB, specifically in study populations with the presence of cardiovascular risk factors.

### A randomized trial of coenzyme Q10 in patients with statin myopathy: rationale and study design [^111cG624]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Statins are the most commonly prescribed and effective medications for reducing low-density lipoprotein levels. Some patients experience myopathic symptoms during statin treatment. The etiology is not known, but depletion of mevalonate pathway metabolites, including coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), has been suggested. Despite a lack of conclusive evidence supporting its utility, CoQ10 supplementation has been recommended to patients who experience myalgic symptoms.

Objective

The Co-Enzyme Q10 in Statin Myopathy study is designed to examine the effect of CoQ10 supplementation on the extent and intensity of muscle pain during treatment with simvastatin.

Methods

We will recruit patients with a documented history of myalgia during statin treatment. The presence of statin-related myalgia will be confirmed in a crossover run-in trial during which the presence and absence of symptoms will be documented during statin and placebo treatment, respectively. Individuals experience myalgic symptoms while taking statins but not placebo will be randomized to receive simvastatin 20 mg daily plus either 600 mg daily of CoQ10 or placebo. Muscle pain intensity will be documented during weekly phone calls via use of the Brief Pain Inventory, Short Form. Treatment will continue for 8 weeks or until muscle symptoms are reported continuously for 1 week or become intolerable, and then subjects will crossover to the alternative treatment (CoQ10 or placebo).

Results

This study is an ongoing clinical trial.

Conclusions

This study will determine the utility of CoQ10 for reducing pain intensity in myalgic patients and will provide guidance for clinicians treating patients with hypercholesterolemia who are intolerant to statins.

### A randomized trial of coenzyme Q10 in patients with confirmed statin myopathy [^115Ay6GA]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation is the most popular therapy for statin myalgia among both physicians and patients despite limited and conflicting evidence of its efficacy.

Objective

This study examined the effect of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation on simvastatin-associated muscle pain, muscle strength and aerobic performance in patients with confirmed statin myalgia.

Methods

Statin myalgia was confirmed in 120 patients with prior symptoms of statin myalgia using an 8-week randomized, double-blind crossover trial of simvastatin 20 mg/d and placebo. Forty-one subjects developed muscle pain with simvastatin but not with placebo and were randomized to simvastatin 20 mg/d combined with CoQ10 (600 mg/d ubiquinol) or placebo for 8 weeks. Muscle pain (Brief Pain Inventory [BPI]), time to pain onset, arm and leg muscle strength, and maximal oxygen uptake (VO₂max) were measured before and after each treatment.

Results

Serum CoQ10 increased from 1.3 ± 0.4 to 5.2 ± 2.3 mcg/mL with simvastatin and CoQ10, but did not increase with simvastatin and placebo (1.3 ± 0.3 to 0.8 ± 0.2) (p < 0.05). BPI pain severity and interference scores increased with simvastatin therapy (both p < 0.01), irrespective of CoQ10 assignment (p = 0.53 and 0.56). There were no changes in muscle strength or VO₂max with simvastatin with or without CoQ10 (all p > 0.10). Marginally more subjects reported pain with CoQ10 (14 of 20 vs 7 of 18; p = 0.05). There was no difference in time to pain onset in the CoQ10 (3.0 ± 2.0 weeks) vs. placebo (2.4 ± 2.1 wks) groups (p = 0.55). A similar lack of CoQ10 effect was observed in 24 subjects who were then crossed over to the alternative treatment.

Conclusions

Only 36% of patients complaining of statin myalgia develop symptoms during a randomized, double-blind crossover of statin vs placebo. CoQ10 supplementation does not reduce muscle pain in patients with statin myalgia. Trial RegistrationNCT01140308; www.clinicaltrials.gov.

### Considerations for supplementing with coenzyme Q10 during statin therapy [^1116BvRZ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature concerning the effects of statin use on coenzyme (Co) Q10 concentrations and explain the rationale behind considering CoQ10 supplementation.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search was conducted through January 2006. Search terms included ubiquinone, coenzyme Q10, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, myotoxicity, and clinical trials.

Data Synthesis

Statin therapy reduces blood CoQ10 concentrations. Studies exploring how this affects the development of myotoxicity have been small and dissimilar, thus limiting the ability to draw strong conclusions. Isolated studies suggested that statins induce mitochondrial dysfunction, but the clinical implications of this effect are limited. Limited data suggest that patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, heart failure, or who are over 65 years of age might represent at-risk populations who would benefit from CoQ10 supplementation.

Conclusions

Routine CoQ10 supplementation for all patients taking statins to prevent myotoxicity is not recommended. However, certain subpopulations might be at risk and warrant further study.

### Benefit of CoQ-10 in patients on statins… [^1111gir4]. ClinicalTrials (2009). Low credibility.

Benefit of CoQ-10 in Patients on Statins ClinicalTrials. gov ID
- Pain scores should be reduced Specific Aim 1: to demonstrate that supplementation with coQ10 in patients treated with statins ameliorates symptoms of muscle pain and fatigue and improves energy metabolism and muscle function. This objective will be achieved in a randomized, placebo-controlled double blind trial by assessing the degree of muscle symptoms and interference of pain with daily activities, aerobic capacity, and muscle function before and after supplementation with either coQ10 or placebo in groups of statin-treated subjects. Specific Aim 2: to examine changes at a molecular/cellular level that are associated with improved pain and muscle function in statin-treated subjects supplemented with coQ10. This aim will be addressed by analyzing muscle biopsies taken from statin-treated patients before and after supplementation with coQ10 or placebo.

Table 4
Subgroup analysis of included randomized controlled trials for the effect of CoQ10 supplementation on HbA1c.

CoQ10 supplementation reduced fasting insulin to a statistically significant degree (WMD: -1.32 μIU/ml; 95% CI: -2.06, -0.58 μIU/ml; P < 0.001; n = 1234 in 24 studies; I² = 78.86%) compared with control group (Figure 4). Subgroup analysis suggested that lower CoQ10 dosage, longer duration, low risk of bias, and placebo as control group were potential factors. The impact of CoQ10 on fasting insulin was greater at supplemental doses < 200 mg/day (WMD: -1.71 μIU/ml, 95% CI: -2.57, -0.85 μIU/ml, P < 0.001) compared with remaining groups. As for the treatment duration, the effect of CoQ10 on reducing fasting insulin was better at duration ≥ 12 weeks (WMD: -1.51 μIU/ml, 95% CI: -2.52, -0.50 μIU/ml, P < 0.001) compared with duration < 12 weeks. With respect to the risk of bias and industry funding, the reduction on fasting insulin was greater at low risk of bias (WMD: -1.50 μIU/ml, 95% CI: -2.29, -0.71 μIU/ml, P < 0.001) and not receiving industry funding (Table 5).

Our results found that CoQ10 supplementation might have beneficial effects on glycemic control, especially in diabetic patients. Taking 100–200 mg/day of CoQ10 could achieve the greatest benefit for glycemic control. These findings add new information about the beneficial effects of CoQ10 supplementation on glycemic control, and are conducive to setting up nutrition guidelines for recommended daily intake of CoQ10 in patients with glycemic disorders.

### Amelioration of radiation enteropathy by dietary supplementation with reduced coenzyme Q10 [^111SoxxG]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

The efficacy of concurrent administration of CoQ10 during cancer treatment remains controversial. Lamson et alreported that exogenous antioxidants alone are beneficial during cancer treatment and do not reduce the efficacy of chemotherapy or radiation when administered concurrently. Similarly, Roffe et alsurveyed several clinical trials of CoQ10 supplements and found no evidence of adverse effects or interference with standard chemotherapies. Consistent with these reports, our in vitro and in vivo experiments indicated no inhibition of radiation effects on malignant cells after rCoQ10 administration (Fig. 5). Importantly, we found that increased plasma CoQ10 concentrations were similar after both dietary administration and a single massive dose; therefore, in vivo experiments focused on dietary administration of rCoQ10 without an accompanying massive dose of rCoQ10, with this resulting in no changes in tumor growth or decreases in the antitumor effects of radiation therapy.

Ten RCTs 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, 21, 22 (237 patients in the CoQ10 supplementation group versus 225 patients in the placebo group) evaluated the effect of CoQ10 supplementation on plasma CK. Compared with placebo, CoQ10 supplementation did not decrease the plasma CK (WMD, 0.09; 95% CI, −0.06 to 0.24; P = 0.23), according to the result from the fixed‐effect model (Figure 6), which was consistent with the result from the random‐effect model (WMD, 0.03; 95% CI, −0.40 to 0.46; P = 0.85) (Figure 7). There was no difference among regions on the outcome (Figures 8 and 9). A significant heterogeneity (I² = 80.3%, P < 0.001) (Figures 6 and 7) was observed in the included studies, which was independent of the administration doses of CoQ10 (exp, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.99–1.00; adjusted R² = 6.59%; P = 0.45), CoQ10 supplementation time (exp, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.01; adjusted R² = 8.27%; P = 0.30), and year of publication (exp, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.83–1.06; adjusted R² = 20.7%; P = 0.24) (Figure 5 D through 5 F).

### Efficacy of coenzyme Q10 for improved tolerability of cancer treatments: a systematic review [^112p52Sn]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this systematic review was to summarize and evaluate the evidence available for oral supplementation with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) to improve the tolerability of cancer treatments.

Materials and Methods

Searches for all published and unpublished controlled trials were carried out on seven databases. Manufacturers of CoQ10 were identified and contacted. Controlled clinical trials of monopreparations of CoQ10 administered orally to cancer patients were included. No language restrictions were imposed. Data were extracted independently by two authors according to predefined criteria.

Results

Six studies were included in the review, including three randomized clinical trials and three nonrandomized clinical trials. Patients in five of six studies received anthracyclines. The results suggested that CoQ10 provides some protection against cardiotoxicity or liver toxicity during cancer treatment. However, because of inadequate reporting and analysis, as well as questionable validity of outcome measures, the results are not conclusive.

Conclusion

Suggestions that CoQ10 might reduce the toxicity of cancer treatments have not been tested by rigorous trials. Further investigations are necessary to determine whether CoQ10 can improve the tolerability of cancer treatments.

### Antioxidant vitamins C, E and coenzyme Q10 vs dexamethasone: comparisons of their effects in pulmonary contusion model [^114R4vx8]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

This leads to increased alveolocapillary membrane permeability and microvascular leakage associated with the formation of alveolar oedema fluid, proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes, and reactive oxygens species (ROS). Alveolar macrophages can produce potent ROS, such as superoxide radicals and, consequently, peroxynitrite. Peroxynitrite can be produced by the reaction of NO with superoxide radicals and represents a highly oxidative species. These ROS in turn are capable of initiating and promoting oxidative damage in the form of lipid peroxidation. Some organs might prevent the damaging effects of the oxidant species through enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses. These defenses include enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is a good indicator of free radical formation, and its elevation shows increased lipid peroxidation due to the effects of these radicals. In our study, MDA levels showed significant increases after contusion, reflecting an indirect finding of oxidative damage. Similarly, NO levels were significantly elevated in the lung tissue. SOD activities were demonstrated to be decreased in the contused rats. These results suggest that oxidants and antioxidants participate in the mechanism of lung injury induced by PC.

The deleterious effects of the free radicals are determined by a delicate balance between the rate of their production and elimination by the different antioxidant systems. Beneficial effects of antioxidant molecules in experimental ALI, blunt trauma and PC models have been established in previous studies. Maxwell et al. established the positive effects of the antioxidant drug Tempol® in a pig model with unilateral PC. Davis et al. showed that systemic levels of prostacyclin and tromboxane elevate after PC. They also showed attenuation of pulmonary failure by pretreatment with indomethacin due to the effect of prostanoid inhibition. Koksel et al. caused ALI in rats by intravenous administration of oleic acid and showed the positive effects of NAC, which has antioxidant properties. Türüt et al. investigated the biochemical and histopathologic effects of dexamethasone, NAC and aprotinin in PC rat models. They reported that Dxm, NAC and aprotinin treatment have positive effects in bilateral PC, which activates an oxidant-antioxidant cascade.

### The role of coenzyme Q10 in heart failure [^113PwaCs]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the clinical data demonstrating the safety and efficacy of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in heart failure (HF).

Data Sources

Pertinent literature was identified through MEDLINE (1966-January 2005) using the search terms coenzyme Q10, heart failure, antioxidants, and oxidative stress. Only articles written in the English language and evaluating human subjects were used.

Data Synthesis

HF impairs the ability of the heart to maintain its normal cardiac output. Following an initial insult, cardiac remodeling ensues, resulting in left ventricular dilation and hypertrophy. Oxidative stress is also increased, while CoQ10 levels are decreased in patients with HF. This has led to the hypothesis that CoQ10, an antioxidant, may decrease oxidative stress, impair remodeling, and improve cardiac function.

Conclusions

Large, well-designed studies on this topic are lacking. The limited data from well-designed trials indicate there may be some minor benefits with CoQ10 therapy in ejection fraction and end diastolic volume. CoQ10 therapy has been shown to be relatively safe with a low incidence of adverse effects.

### The effect of pravastatin and atorvastatin on coenzyme Q10 [^116VzhNa]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an antioxidant and plays an important role in the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate. Studies suggest that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors reduce CoQ10 levels; however, no studies have directly compared HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in a randomized crossover fashion.

Methods

Twelve healthy volunteers received either 20 mg pravastatin (P) or 10 mg atorvastatin (A) for 4 weeks in a randomized crossover fashion. There was a 4- to 8-week washout period between the 2 phases. CoQ10 levels and a lipid profile were obtained.

Results

There was no difference in CoQ10 levels from baseline to post-drug therapy for either P or A (0.61 ± 0.14 vs 0.62 ± 0.2 microg/mL and 0.65 ± 0.22 vs 0.6 ± 0.12 microg/mL, respectively; P > .05). There was a significant difference in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels from baseline to post-drug therapy for both P and A (97 ± 21 vs 66 ± 19 mg/dL and 102 ± 21 vs 52 ± 14 mg/dL, respectively; P < .01). There was no significant correlation between LDL and CoQ10.

Conclusions

P and A did not decrease CoQ10 despite a significant decrease in LDL levels. These findings suggest that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors do not significantly decrease the synthesis of circulating CoQ10 in healthy subjects. Routine supplementation of CoQ10 may not be necessary when HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy is administered.

### Coenzyme Q10 for the treatment of heart failure: a review of the literature [^113bMUHx]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an endogenously synthesised and diet-supplied lipid-soluble cofactor that functions in the mitochondrial inner membrane to transfer electrons from complexes I and II to complex III. In addition, its redox activity enables CoQ10 to act as a membrane antioxidant. In patients with congestive heart failure, myocardial CoQ10 content tends to decline as the degree of heart failure worsens. A number of controlled pilot trials with supplemental CoQ10 in heart failure found improvements in functional parameters such as ejection fraction, stroke volume and cardiac output, without side effects. Subsequent meta-analyses have confirmed these findings, although the magnitude of benefit tends to be less notable in patients with severe heart failure, or within the context of ACE inhibitor therapy. The multicentre randomised placebo-controlled Q-SYMBIO trial has assessed the impact of supplemental CoQ10 on hard endpoints in heart failure. A total of 420 patients received either CoQ10 (100mg three times daily) or placebo and were followed for 2years. Although short-term functional endpoints were not statistically different in the two groups, CoQ10 significantly reduced the primary long-term endpoint-a major adverse cardiovascular event-which was observed in 15% of the treated participants compared to 26% of those receiving placebo (HR = 0.50, CI 0.32 to 0.80, p = 0.003). Particularly in light of the excellent tolerance and affordability of this natural physiological compound, supplemental CoQ10 has emerged as an attractive option in the management of heart failure, and merits evaluation in additional large studies.

### The role of coenzyme Q10 in statin-associated myopathy: a systematic review [^117MmGAv]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) are currently the most effective medications for reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Although generally safe, they have been associated with a variety of myopathic complaints. Statins block production of farnesyl pyrophosphate, an intermediate in the synthesis of ubiquinone or coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). This fact, plus the role of CoQ10 in mitochondrial energy production, has prompted the hypothesis that statin-induced CoQ10 deficiency is involved in the pathogenesis of statin myopathy. We identified English language articles relating statin treatment and CoQ10 levels via a PubMed search through August 2006. Abstracts were reviewed and articles addressing the relationship between statin treatment and CoQ10 levels were examined in detail. Statin treatment reduces circulating levels of CoQ10. The effect of statin therapy on intramuscular levels of CoQ10 is not clear, and data on intramuscular CoQ10 levels in symptomatic patients with statin-associated myopathy are scarce. Mitochondrial function may be impaired by statin therapy, and this effect may be exacerbated by exercise. Supplementation can raise the circulating levels of CoQ10, but data on the effect of CoQ10 supplementation on myopathic symptoms are scarce and contradictory. We conclude that there is insufficient evidence to prove the etiologic role of CoQ10 deficiency in statin-associated myopathy and that large, well-designed clinical trials are required to address this issue. The routine use of CoQ10 cannot be recommended in statin-treated patients. Nevertheless, there are no known risks to this supplement and there is some anecdotal and preliminary trial evidence of its effectiveness. Consequently, CoQ10 can be tested in patients requiring statin treatment, who develop statin myalgia, and who cannot be satisfactorily treated with other agents. Some patients may respond, if only via a placebo effect.

### Coenzyme Q10 for the treatment of heart failure: a review of the literature [^116Bst9x]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Trial data of CoQ10 therapy in HF

There have been numerous observational reports in the last few decades reporting the usefulness of CoQ10 in improving HF symptoms, including ejection fraction, left ventricular size and quality of life. However, these studies had several design shortcomings, which have prevented their translation into clinical practice.

Several clinical trials report comparisons of CoQ10 efficacy versus placebo. While some report no advantage over placebo, others conclude that CoQ10 supplementation improves systolic function and reduces ventricular size. Thus, due to small sample sizes and concomitant large effect sizes in these trials, it may be difficult to make certain statements regarding advantages and disadvantages of CoQ10 therapy. Also, it is difficult to assess the benefits of CoQ10 with respect to severity and aetiology of HF, and to segregate responders versus non-responders. Subsequently, to overcome these limitations, the trial data were pooled using meta-analysis to better understand the benefits of CoQ10 therapy.

### Effects of coenzyme Q10 supplementation on lipid profiles in adults: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116VzD1P]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Context

Previous meta-analyses have suggested that the effects of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) on lipid profiles remain debatable. Additionally, no meta-analysis has explored the optimal intake of CoQ10 for attenuating lipid profiles in adults.

Objective

This study conducted a meta-analysis to determine the effects of CoQ10 on lipid profiles and assess their dose-response relationships in adults.

Methods

Databases (Web of Science, PubMed/Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library) were systematically searched until August 10, 2022. The random effects model was used to calculate the mean differences (MDs) and 95% CI for changes in circulating lipid profiles. The novel single-stage restricted cubic spline regression model was applied to explore nonlinear dose-response relationships.

Results

Fifty randomized controlled trials with a total of 2794 participants were included in the qualitative synthesis. The pooled analysis revealed that CoQ10 supplementation significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC) (MD -5.53mg/dL; 95% CI -8.40, -2.66; I² = 70%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (MD -3.03mg/dL; 95% CI -5.25, -0.81; I² = 54%), and triglycerides (TGs) (MD -9.06mg/dL; 95% CI -14.04, -4.08; I² = 65%) and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (MD 0.83mg/dL; 95% CI 0.01, 1.65; I² = 82%). The dose-response analysis showed an inverse J-shaped nonlinear pattern between CoQ10 supplementation and TC in which 400-500mg/day CoQ10 largely reduced TC (χ² = 48.54, P < .01).

Conclusion

CoQ10 supplementation decreased the TC, LDL-C, and TG levels, and increased HDL-C levels in adults, and the dosage of 400 to 500mg/day achieved the greatest effect on TC.

### A randomized clinical trial of high-dosage coenzyme Q10 in early parkinson disease: no evidence of benefit [^115czQ4o]. JAMA Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), an antioxidant that supports mitochondrial function, has been shown in preclinical Parkinson disease (PD) models to reduce the loss of dopamine neurons, and was safe and well tolerated in early-phase human studies. A previous phase II study suggested possible clinical benefit.

Objective

To examine whether CoQ10 could slow disease progression in early PD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A phase III randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial at 67 North American sites consisting of participants 30 years of age or older who received a diagnosis of PD within 5 years and who had the following inclusion criteria: the presence of a rest tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity; a modified Hoehn and Yahr stage of 2.5 or less; and no anticipated need for dopaminergic therapy within 3 months. Exclusion criteria included the use of any PD medication within 60 days, the use of any symptomatic PD medication for more than 90 days, atypical or drug-induced parkinsonism, a Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) rest tremor score of 3 or greater for any limb, a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 25 or less, a history of stroke, the use of certain supplements, and substantial recent exposure to CoQ10. Of 696 participants screened, 78 were found to be ineligible, and 18 declined participation.

Interventions

The remaining 600 participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo, 1200 mg/d of CoQ10, or 2400 mg/d of CoQ10; all participants received 1200 IU/d of vitamin E.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Participants were observed for 16 months or until a disability requiring dopaminergic treatment. The prospectively defined primary outcome measure was the change in total UPDRS score (Parts I-III) from baseline to final visit. The study was powered to detect a 3-point difference between an active treatment and placebo.

Results

The baseline characteristics of the participants were well balanced, the mean age was 62.5 years, 66% of participants were male, and the mean baseline total UPDRS score was 22.7. A total of 267 participants required treatment (94 received placebo, 87 received 1200 mg/d of CoQ10, and 86 received 2400 mg/d of CoQ10), and 65 participants (29 who received placebo, 19 who received 1200 mg/d of CoQ10, and 17 who received 2400 mg/d of CoQ10) withdrew prematurely. Treatments were well tolerated with no safety concerns. The study was terminated after a prespecified futility criterion was reached. At study termination, both active treatment groups showed slight adverse trends relative to placebo. Adjusted mean changes (worsening) in total UPDRS scores from baseline to final visit were 6.9 points (placebo), 7.5 points (1200 mg/d of CoQ10; P = 0.49 relative to placebo), and 8.0 points (2400 mg/d of CoQ10; P = 0.21 relative to placebo).

Conclusions and Relevance

Coenzyme Q10 was safe and well tolerated in this population, but showed no evidence of clinical benefit.

### The crosstalk between immune activation and metabolism in heart failure. A scientific statement of the heart failure association of the ESC [^116dsyb8]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Immunometabolic effects of established and potential medical therapies for heart failure

The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) is another system that is hyperactivated in presence of cardiac mechanical dysfunction. Apart from regulating blood pressure, angiotensin II is also an important modulator of cardiac energy metabolism and function. Angiotensin II damages mitochondria in the cardiomyocyte by increasing ROS production, and affects mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, including FFA oxidation. There is also evidence that angiotensin II regulates glucose oxidation and that inhibition of angiotensin II may exert beneficial metabolic effects. In addition, by decreasing oxidative metabolism, angiotensin II can reduce ATP production. In this context, apart from blood pressure and fluid balance regulation, angiotensin II antagonism represents an attractive therapeutic approach to target metabolic deregulation in HF. Additionally, as for beta‐blockers, RAAS antagonism has been shown to yield a significant reduction in markers of inflammation in different cardiological contexts. Angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), compared with angiotensin receptor blockers, appear to produce a more robust anti‐inflammatory effect. However, the role of ACEi in inflammation is still debated. Intrinsic ACE has been detected in macrophages and neutrophils, where its overexpression results in enhanced immune responses, independent of angiotensin II. In contrast, ACE activity is also elevated in certain autoimmune diseases and its inhibition benefits patient outcome where inflammatory immune cells are overactive. Further research on the potential role of ACEi in modulating immune response are definitely warranted.

Cardiac metabolism in HF can also be beneficially targeted by specific drugs, by improving mitochondrial membrane stability, mainly dependent on cardiolipin and coenzyme Q10. Coenzyme Q10 is an obligatory component of the respiratory chain in mitochondria and plays an essential role in ATP formation in most tissues, including the heart. In addition, Q10 has antioxidant properties and protects circulating low‐density lipoprotein particles from oxidation. Its inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore prevents the activation of apoptotic cascades and the oxidative inactivation of key proteins involved in ATP production(Table 1). Lower levels of coenzyme Q10 are associated with worse HF symptoms, lower ejection fraction and higher NT‐proBNP. However, association between its values and mortality remains controversial. Coenzyme Q10 supplementation improved HF symptoms and reduced major cardiovascular outcomes in patients with HF in a randomized controlled trial. However, a more recent meta‐analysis, due to the low quality of available data, concluded for no convincing evidence supporting the use of coenzyme 10 in patients with HF.

### Effects of coenzyme Q10 supplementation on glycemic control: a GRADE-assessed systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115zGTgQ]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous reviews reported that the effects of CoQ10 on glycemic control were inconsistent. There is no review exploring the optimal intake of CoQ10 for glycemic control. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of CoQ10 on glycemic control and evaluate the dose-response relationship via integrating the existing evidence from randomized control trials (RCTs).

Methods

Databases (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library) were searched to identify RCTs for investigating the efficacy of CoQ10 on fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR up to March 12, 2022. We performed a meta-analysis on 40 RCTs of CoQ10. Weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for net changes. Evidence certainty was assessed using GRADE. Dose-response relationships were evaluated using 1-stage restricted cubic spline regression model. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021252933).

Findings

Forty studies (n = 2,424 participants) were included in this meta-analysis. CoQ10 significantly reduced fasting glucose (WMD: -5.22 [95% CI: -8.33, -2.11] mg/dl; P < 0.001; I² = 95.10%), fasting insulin (-1.32 [-2.06, -0.58] μIU/ml; P < 0.001; I² = 78.86%), HbA 1c (-0.12% [-0.23, -0.01]; P = 0.04; I² = 49.10%), and HOMA-IR (-0.69 [-1.00, -0.38]; P < 0.001; I² = 88.80%). The effect of CoQ10 on outcomes was greater in diabetes with lower heterogeneity. A "U" shape dose-response relationship curve revealed that 100–200 mg/day of CoQ10 largely decreased fasting glucose (χ² = 12.08, P nonlinearity = 0.002), fasting insulin (χ² = 9.73, P nonlinearity = 0.008), HbA 1c (χ² = 6.00, P nonlinearity = 0.049), HOMA-IR (χ² = 25.89, P nonlinearity < 0.001).

Interpretation

CoQ10 supplementation has beneficial effects on glycemic control, especially in diabetes, and 100–200 mg/day of CoQ10 could achieve the greatest benefit, which could provide a basis for the dietary guidelines of CoQ10 in patients with glycemic disorders.

### Coenzyme Q10 for heart failure [^112rZC9m]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Coenzyme Q10, or ubiquinone, is a non-prescription nutritional supplement. It is a fat-soluble molecule that acts as an electron carrier in mitochondria and as a coenzyme for mitochondrial enzymes. Coenzyme Q10 deficiency may be associated with a multitude of diseases including heart failure. The severity of heart failure correlates with the severity of coenzyme Q10 deficiency. Emerging data suggest that the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species are increased in patients with heart failure and coenzyme Q10 may help to reduce these toxic effects because of its antioxidant activity. Coenzyme Q10 may also have a role in stabilising myocardial calcium-dependent ion channels and preventing the consumption of metabolites essential for adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. Coenzyme Q10, although not a primary recommended treatment, could be beneficial to patients with heart failure. Several randomised controlled trials have compared coenzyme Q10 to other therapeutic modalities, but no systematic review of existing randomised trials has been conducted.

Objectives

To review the safety and efficacy of coenzyme Q10 in heart failure.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2012, Issue 12); MEDLINE OVID (1950 to January Week 3 2013) and EMBASE OVID (1980 to 2013 Week 03) on 24 January 2013; Web of Science with Conference Proceedings (1970 to January 2013) and CINAHL Plus (1981 to January 2013) on 25 January 2013; and AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine) (1985 to January 2013) on 28 January 2013. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of either parallel or cross-over design that assessed the beneficial and harmful effects of coenzyme Q10 in patients with heart failure. When cross-over studies were identified, we considered data only from the first phase.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data from the included studies onto a pre-designed data extraction form. We then entered the data into Review Manager 5.2 for analysis. We assessed study risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio and for continuous data the mean difference (MD). Where appropriate data were available, we performed meta-analysis. For this review we prioritised data from pooled analyses only. Where meta-analysis was not possible, we wrote a narrative synthesis. We provided a QUOROM flow chart to show the flow of papers.

Main Results

We included seven studies with 914 participants comparing conenzyme Q10 versus placebo. There were no data on clinical events from published randomised trials. The included studies had small sample sizes. Meta-analysis was only possible for a few physiological measures and there was substantial heterogeneity. Only one study reported on total mortality, major cardiovascular events and hospitalisation. Five trials reported on the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of clinical status, but it was impossible to pool data due to heterogeneity. None of the included trials considered quality of life, exercise variables, adverse events or cost-effectiveness as outcome measures. Pooled analysis suggests that the use of coenzyme Q10 has no clear effect on left ventricular ejection fraction (MD -2.26; 95% confidence interval (CI) -15.49 to 10.97, n = 60) or exercise capacity (MD 12.79; 95% CI -140.12 to 165.70, n = 85). Pooled data did indicate that supplementation increased blood levels of coenzyme Q10 (MD 1.46; 95% CI 1.19 to 1.72, n = 112). However, there are only a small number of small studies with a risk of bias, so these results should be interpreted with caution.

Authors' Conclusions

No conclusions can be drawn on the benefits or harms of coenzyme Q10 in heart failure at this time as trials published to date lack information on clinically relevant endpoints. Furthermore, the existing data are derived from small, heterogeneous trials that concentrate on physiological measures: their results are inconclusive. Until further evidence emerges to support the use of coenzyme Q10 in heart failure, there might be a need to re-evaluate whether further trials testing coenzyme Q10 in heart failure are desirable.

### Effect of CoQ10 on the outcome of MAFLD patients… [^111JfyRv]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory biomarkers, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and adipokines play key roles in the pathogenesis of MAFLD, hence, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of coenzyme Q10 especially at high doses that have not been tested are hypothesized to have a beneficial role in improving the systemic inflammation and biochemical variables. Recent evidence suggests that CoQ10 supplementation might be useful in improving and preventing pathological conditions such as metabolic syndrome, hypertension, diabetes, liver diseases, and insulin resistance Because of its antioxidant activity, it seems that CoQ10 can prevent activation of the inflammatory signaling pathway. Many studies have shown that administration of CoQ10 reduced hepatic oxidative stress and inflammation. Also, other studies observed that CoQ10 supplementation reduced TNF-α production and serum levels of liver aminotransferase and decreased NF-kB expression.

In addition, a previously published study showed that a dose of 100 mg/day of CoQ10 for 4 weeks can improve serum AST levels, total antioxidant capacity and waist circumference, but it had a non-significant effect on insulin resistance and MDA levels. The same result was found in the study by Esfahani et al. reporting improvement in AST and ALT concentrations and lower grades of portal inflammation and hepatocellular liver necrosis in thioacetamide-induced liver damage in rats. Yet, some contradicting results were reported by Hodgson et al. were they found a non-significant reduction in body weight after CoQ10 supplementation in patients with T2DM. These contradictions were addressed by Faresi et al. where they tested the effect of the same oral dose of CoQ10 used by Farhangi et al. for 12 weeks, where it had beneficial effects on serum levels of TNF-a, hs-CRP, hepatic enzymes, adiponectin, and NAFLD grades as well as near-significant changes in serum leptin among patients with NAFLD.

However, serum IL-6 levels and AAR remained unchanged after CoQ10 supplementation.
