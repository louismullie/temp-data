## Question

What are other antibiotic options for thoracic osteomyelitis with MSSA bacteremia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about antibiotic selection for thoracic vertebral osteomyelitis with MSSA bacteremia, including empiric strategy, definitive therapy, duration, source control, and special scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and why MSSA bacteremia plus vertebral osteomyelitis changes management. Then, I should verify empiric therapy principles and when to start antibiotics. Next, I will confirm the definitive regimen once MSSA is identified, including dosing and monitoring. After that, I need to check duration and whether early oral step-down is appropriate. I will then examine source control and surgical indications. Finally, I should review special populations, monitoring for complications, and a concise decision algorithm, making sure each point is supported by guidelines or high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and its implications. Thoracic vertebral osteomyelitis in the setting of S. aureus bacteremia is a high-risk presentation with potential for epidural abscess, spinal instability, and persistent bacteremia; MSSA is generally more responsive to beta-lactams than MRSA, but the presence of bacteremia mandates thorough evaluation for endocarditis and metastatic foci, and prolonged bacteremia correlates with worse outcomes, so I need to ensure we do not miss those complications and that we plan for at least 6 weeks of therapy if bone involvement is confirmed [^115srBTr] [^117PB92X].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about starting empiric therapy. I should verify the IDSA stance: in stable patients with normal neurologic status, hold empiric antibiotics until cultures are obtained to preserve diagnostic yield; however, if there is hemodynamic instability, sepsis, septic shock, or progressive neurologic deficits, start empiric therapy immediately while pursuing source control and diagnostics, because delays worsen outcomes in S. aureus bacteremia [^116x95ao] [^115ruohf] [^113J2gsw].

> I need to check the empiric regimen when it is indicated. For suspected S. aureus bacteremia with possible MRSA, vancomycin or daptomycin are appropriate empiric anchors; if there is concern for gram-negative sources or severe sepsis, add a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin or a carbapenem based on local epidemiology and risk factors, and tailor promptly when susceptibilities return [^115srBTr] [^115wn2nT].

> Wait, let me verify the definitive therapy once MSSA is confirmed. The gold standard is an antistaphylococcal beta-lactam: nafcillin or oxacillin 1.5–2 g IV every 4–6 hours, or cefazolin 1–2 g IV every 8 hours; ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily is an alternative when dosing convenience is needed, though it is less active than cefazolin against MSSA and should be reserved for selected cases with close monitoring [^115Jk7FS] [^115srBTr].

> I should confirm duration and route. For native vertebral osteomyelitis, a total of 6 weeks of therapy is recommended; parenteral therapy throughout is traditional, but high-quality evidence supports early switch to highly bioavailable oral agents after clinical improvement and clearance of bacteremia, with fluoroquinolones, linezolid, or metronidazole as acceptable options depending on the pathogen and clinical context; oral beta-lactams are not recommended for initial therapy due to inadequate bioavailability in bone, though high-dose oral cephalexin has emerging pediatric data after IV stabilization, so I need to be cautious extrapolating to adults [^113ks4XR] [^116xr3fx].

> Let me consider source control, because antibiotics alone are insufficient if there is ongoing seeding. I should confirm indications for surgery: progressive neurologic deficits, spinal instability or deformity, persistent or recurrent bacteremia without another source, or worsening pain despite appropriate therapy warrant debridement with or without stabilization; conversely, worsening imaging at 4–6 weeks without clinical deterioration should not prompt surgery by itself [^1122C5xf] [^112VQkTH].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot tolerate beta-lactams or has a severe allergy. In that case, vancomycin or daptomycin are reasonable alternatives, recognizing that beta-lactams remain superior for MSSA; vancomycin requires therapeutic drug monitoring with targets of 15–20 mcg/mL for serious infections, and daptomycin is dosed at 6 mg/kg IV daily, with attention to resistance emergence during prolonged therapy [^111w7k4H] [^114bJkS3].

> I should double-check special populations. In pediatrics, cefazolin or an antistaphylococcal penicillin are preferred for MSSA, and total durations of 3–4 weeks are often sufficient for uncomplicated acute hematogenous osteomyelitis after clinical response, with early switch to oral cephalexin or clindamycin when appropriate; in persons who inject drugs, partial oral therapy after at least 10 days of effective IV therapy and clearance of bacteremia can be noninferior to standard IV-only approaches when paired with outpatient support [^115rEzyk] [^116xr3fx] [^116L41sC].

> Next, I should review monitoring and complications. Persistent bacteremia beyond 48 hours is associated with markedly increased 90-day mortality, so I need to ensure repeat blood cultures until clearance, evaluate for endocarditis with echocardiography, and surveil for metastatic foci; each additional day of S. aureus bacteremia increases mortality risk, reinforcing the need for timely source control and appropriate therapy [^115srBTr] [^114PNijE].

> Hold on, I should verify whether combination therapy helps in MSSA bacteremia. Recent randomized data show that adding fosfomycin to a beta-lactam did not improve early treatment success in MSSA bacteremia, and adjunctive rifampin likewise failed to improve outcomes in S. aureus bacteremia, so routine combination therapy is not supported; I need to avoid reflexively adding rifampin or fosfomycin unless there is a compelling individualized rationale [^112Rufiq] [^114PNijE].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway. If stable, hold empiric therapy, obtain cultures, and image the spine with MRI; if unstable or with neurologic compromise, start vancomycin or daptomycin plus gram-negative coverage as indicated and pursue urgent source control. Once MSSA is confirmed, switch to nafcillin, oxacillin, or cefazolin and continue for a total of 6 weeks, considering an early switch to highly bioavailable oral therapy after clinical stability and bacteremia clearance; throughout, monitor cultures, obtain echocardiography, and involve surgery if red flags arise [^116x95ao] [^115srBTr] [^113ks4XR] [^1122C5xf].

> Finally, I need to ensure the key takeaways are explicit. First-line definitive therapy for thoracic vertebral osteomyelitis with MSSA bacteremia is an antistaphylococcal beta-lactam for a total of 6 weeks, with early oral step-down considered in appropriate responders; empiric therapy should be reserved for unstable patients and de-escalated promptly; source control and complication surveillance are essential; and routine combination therapy does not improve outcomes in MSSA bacteremia, so I should avoid it outside of research or exceptional circumstances [^115Jk7FS] [^113ks4XR] [^115srBTr] [^112Rufiq].

---

For thoracic osteomyelitis with MSSA bacteremia, **beta-lactams are first-line** [^115srBTr] (nafcillin/oxacillin or cefazolin) for 6 weeks [^113ks4XR]. If beta-lactams are contraindicated, **vancomycin or daptomycin are alternatives** [^115Jk7FS] [^114bJkS3]; use vancomycin 15–20 mg/kg IV every 12 hours with trough monitoring [^115Jk7FS] [^111w7k4H] or daptomycin 6 mg/kg IV daily [^114bJkS3]. Ceftaroline is a **reasonable option** when first-line agents are unsuitable or resistance emerges [^1156vTRT]. Rifampin should be added only after clearance of bacteremia and in select cases due to limited evidence [^116NjBW6] [^112Rufiq]. Therapy should be individualized based on renal/hepatic function, allergies, and clinical response, with close monitoring for adverse effects and adherence [^11588wkg].

---

## First-line antibiotic therapy

Beta-lactam antibiotics are the **preferred first-line therapy** for MSSA infections, including thoracic osteomyelitis with bacteremia [^115srBTr]. They provide excellent bactericidal activity, favorable pharmacokinetics, and proven clinical efficacy [^notfound].

- **Nafcillin or oxacillin**: 1.5–2 g IV every 4–6 hours (or continuous infusion) for 6 weeks [^115Jk7FS] [^113ks4XR].

- **Cefazolin**: 1–2 g IV every 8 hours for 6 weeks [^115Jk7FS] [^113ks4XR].

- **Ceftriaxone**: 2 g IV every 24 hours for 6 weeks (alternative option) [^115Jk7FS] [^113ks4XR].

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapy

In cases of beta-lactam allergy or intolerance, or when first-line agents are contraindicated, **alternative antibiotic regimens** are recommended [^117Cu1of].

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage and administration** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|
| Vancomycin | 15–20 mg/kg IV every 12 hours (consider loading dose, monitor serum levels) | - Requires therapeutic drug monitoring [^111w7k4H] <br/> - Monitor for nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity [^notfound] |
| Daptomycin | 6 mg/kg IV once daily | - Alternative to vancomycin [^114bJkS3] <br/> - Monitor for muscle toxicity (CPK levels) [^notfound] |
| Ceftaroline | 600 mg IV every 12 hours | - Option for refractory cases or when first-line agents are unsuitable [^1156vTRT] <br/> - Limited evidence in osteomyelitis |

---

## Adjunctive therapy

Rifampin may be considered as adjunctive therapy in select cases, particularly in chronic or biofilm-associated infections [^116NjBW6]. However, **evidence supporting routine rifampin use is limited** [^112Rufiq], and it should be added only after clearance of bacteremia and in consultation with infectious disease specialists [^116NjBW6].

---

## Duration of therapy

The **recommended duration of antibiotic therapy** for thoracic osteomyelitis with MSSA bacteremia is typically 6 weeks [^113ks4XR]. This duration balances the need for adequate infection eradication with minimizing the risk of antibiotic-related complications.

---

## Clinical considerations and monitoring

- **Renal and hepatic function**: Antibiotic dosing should be adjusted based on renal and hepatic function to prevent toxicity [^11588wkg].

- **Adverse effects**: Monitor for adverse effects specific to each antibiotic, such as nephrotoxicity with vancomycin [^116tzX7C] and muscle toxicity with daptomycin [^notfound].

- **Clinical response**: Regular clinical assessment, including inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) and imaging studies, is essential to monitor treatment response and adjust therapy accordingly [^1148uTiz].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: Nafcillin, oxacillin, or cefazolin for 6 weeks [^115Jk7FS] [^113ks4XR].

- **Alternative therapy**: Vancomycin or daptomycin if beta-lactams are contraindicated [^114bJkS3].

- **Adjunctive therapy**: Rifampin considered only in select cases after clearance of bacteremia [^116NjBW6].

- **Duration**: 6 weeks of therapy [^113ks4XR].

- **Monitoring**: Regular assessment of clinical response, renal/hepatic function, and adverse effects [^11588wkg].

---

Beta-lactam antibiotics are the **preferred first-line therapy** for thoracic osteomyelitis with MSSA bacteremia, with vancomycin or daptomycin as alternatives when beta-lactams are contraindicated. Rifampin may be considered as adjunctive therapy in select cases, and therapy should be individualized based on patient-specific factors and clinical response.

Native vertebral osteomyelitis (NVO) — timing and content of empiric antimicrobial therapy: In patients with a normal and stable neurologic examination and stable hemodynamics, we suggest holding empiric antimicrobial therapy until a microbiologic diagnosis is established (weak, low), and establishing the diagnosis prior to empiric therapy would improve the sensitivity of culture results. When empiric therapy is deemed appropriate, physicians should use regimens that would include coverage against staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), streptococci, and gram-negative bacilli; such regimens might include vancomycin plus a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin, with alternatives in allergy or intolerance including daptomycin plus a quinolone.

### Incidence, prevalence, and management of MRSA bacteremia across patient populations-a review of recent developments in MRSA management and treatment [^115nMZR7]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial resistance is a major global health concern, and, of the Gram-positive bacteria, drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a serious threat. S. aureus causes a wide range of infections commonly involving the skin, soft tissue, bone, joints, and infections associated with indwelling catheters or prosthetic devices. In addition, S. aureus is a leading cause of bacteremia in industrialized nations. Although methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteremia incidence has decreased over the past decade, MRSA remains associated with poorer clinical outcomes compared with methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) often causes metastatic infections such as infective endocarditis (IE), septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis. Moreover, SAB can lead to complications such as sepsis and septic shock. Taken together, these issues make SAB particularly challenging to treat.

Choice and timing of antibacterial therapy greatly affect treatment outcomes in SAB. For SAB caused by MSSA, β-lactam therapy is considered the gold standard. For MRSA, the 2011 Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend treatment with vancomycin or daptomycin. However, each antimicrobial agent has limitations. Several issues restrict the utility of vancomycin, including slow bactericidal activity, low tissue penetration, and increasing reports of resistance and failure. While daptomycin is effective against MRSA bacteremia, treatment-emergent nonsusceptibility is concerning, and evidence suggests prior vancomycin treatment may encourage daptomycin resistance in S. aureus. Given the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with SAB and the limitations of currently approved treatments, there is a need to identify alternative agents for the treatment of MRSA bacteremia. Time to effective treatment is largely dependent on pathogen identification. Delays in diagnosing and treating SAB lead to poorer clinical outcomes. Standard microbial identification techniques take between 48 and 72 h, while recently developed rapid diagnostic tests provide data within 3 h of collection. By enabling optimized antimicrobial therapy, rapid diagnostic tests may lower mortality, hospitalization, and costs. This review discusses the global incidence and prevalence, diagnostic methods, and current management strategies for SAB. We also briefly discuss another key part of MRSA infection management — prevention; however, an in depth discussion is beyond the scope of this review.

### Management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a review [^115srBTr]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Staphylococcus aureus, a gram-positive bacterium, is the leading cause of death from bacteremia worldwide, with a case fatality rate of 15% to 30% and an estimated 300 000 deaths per year.

Observations

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia causes metastatic infection in more than one-third of cases, including endocarditis (≈12%), septic arthritis (7%), vertebral osteomyelitis (≈4%), spinal epidural abscess, psoas abscess, splenic abscess, septic pulmonary emboli, and seeding of implantable medical devices. Patients with S aureus bacteremia commonly present with fever or symptoms from metastatic infection, such as pain in the back, joints, abdomen or extremities, and/or change in mental status. Risk factors include intravascular devices such as implantable cardiac devices and dialysis vascular catheters, recent surgical procedures, injection drug use, diabetes, and previous S aureus infection. Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is detected with blood cultures. Prolonged S aureus bacteremia (≥ 48 hours) is associated with a 90-day mortality risk of 39%. All patients with S aureus bacteremia should undergo transthoracic echocardiography; transesophageal echocardiography should be performed in patients at high risk for endocarditis, such as those with persistent bacteremia, persistent fever, metastatic infection foci, or implantable cardiac devices. Other imaging modalities, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, should be performed based on symptoms and localizing signs of metastatic infection. Staphylococcus aureus is categorized as methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) or methicillin-resistant (MRSA) based on susceptibility to β-lactam antibiotics. Initial treatment for S aureus bacteremia typically includes antibiotics active against MRSA such as vancomycin or daptomycin. Once antibiotic susceptibility results are available, antibiotics should be adjusted. Cefazolin or antistaphylococcal penicillins should be used for MSSA and vancomycin, daptomycin, or ceftobiprole for MRSA. Phase 3 trials for S aureus bacteremia demonstrated noninferiority of daptomycin to standard of care (treatment success, 53/120 [44%] vs 48/115 [42%]) and noninferiority of ceftobiprole to daptomycin (treatment success, 132/189 [70%] vs 136/198 [69%]). Source control is a critical component of treating S aureus bacteremia and may include removal of infected intravascular or implanted devices, drainage of abscesses, and surgical debridement.

Conclusions and Relevance

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia has a case fatality rate of 15% to 30% and causes 300 000 deaths per year worldwide. Empirical antibiotic treatment should include vancomycin or daptomycin, which are active against MRSA. Once S aureus susceptibilities are known, MSSA should be treated with cefazolin or an antistaphylococcal penicillin. Additional clinical management consists of identifying sites of metastatic infection and pursuing source control for identified foci of infection.

Regarding specific circumstances for vertebral osteomyelitis, more specifically with respect to patients with MRSA osteomyelitis (management), IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend to administer the following options as alternatives to vancomycin and clindamycin in pediatric patients:

- daptomycin IV 6 mg/kg/day once daily

- linezolid PO/IV 600 mg BID in patients aged ≥ 12 years and 10 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours in patients aged < 12 years.

### Is it time to replace vancomycin in the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections? [^111m3NJf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

For more than 4 decades, vancomycin has been the antibiotic of choice for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Recently, infections due to isolates with high but susceptible vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations have been associated with additional treatment failures and patient mortality. These poorer outcomes may in part be explained by the inability of attaining appropriate vancomycin levels in these patients. However, assumptions that these poor outcomes are solely due to failure to achieve optimal serum levels of vancomycin are premature. The availability of effective alternatives further erodes the position of vancomycin as first-line therapy. The emergence of resistance and cost considerations, however, favor a more measured approach when using alternative antimicrobials. Collectively, the current available data suggest that the optimal therapy for MRSA infections remains unclear. In the absence of further data, the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines remain relevant and inform clinicians of best practice for treating patients with MRSA infections.

### Therapeutic options for adult patients with persistent methicillin-susceptibleBacteremia: a narrative review [^116JxcCZ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of antimicrobial therapies used in the management of persistent methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia.

Data Sources

A literature search using the PubMed database (inception to December 2022) was conducted using the search terms " Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia", "methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia", "persistent methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia", and "refractory methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia ". In addition, therapeutic agents which could be used as treatment for MSSA including "nafcillin", "oxacillin", "cefazolin", "ceftaroline", "gentamicin", "rifampin", and "daptomycin" were also combined with the aforementioned search terms to capture data using these agents.

Study Selection/Data Extraction

Clinical data were limited to those published in the English language. Articles and abstracts were considered for inclusion in addition to ongoing trials identified through ClinicalTrials.gov.

Data Synthesis

A total of 78 articles were reviewed including 17 in vitro or animal model studies and 39 studies including patient data. The remaining 22 articles included guidelines, review articles, and editorials. Recent data evaluating use of dual β-lactam regimens for persistent MSSA bacteremia were limited to 8 case reports or case series.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

At present, there is little guidance on how to best manage patients with persistent MSSA bacteremia. This narrative review collates the available data to assist clinicians in selecting the best possible antimicrobial regimen when facing this clinical conundrum.

Conclusions

Modification of antimicrobial therapy, in conjunction with source control and infectious diseases consultation, may all be necessary to sterilize blood cultures in patients with persistent MSSA bacteremia.

### Contemporary management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia-controversies in clinical practice [^111SQUPW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) carries a high risk for excess morbidity and mortality. Despite its prevalence, significant practice variation continues to permeate clinical management of this syndrome. Since the publication of the 2011 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines on management of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, the field of SAB has evolved with the emergence of newer diagnostic strategies and therapeutic options. In this review, we seek to provide a comprehensive overview of the evaluation and management of SAB, with special focus on areas where the highest level of evidence is lacking to inform best practices.

### Future strategies for treating Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections [^114ah2Mj]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Bloodstream infections are potentially life-threatening diseases. They can cause serious secondary infections, such as infective endocarditis and osteomyelitis, and may result in severe sepsis. One of the most critical determinants of survival is the induction of timely and effective antibiotic therapy. One of the leading causes of bloodstream infections is Staphylococcus aureus, with an increasing proportion of isolates being resistant to methicillin. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is associated with greater morbidity and mortality rates than methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). Standard-of-care antibiotic treatments for S. aureus bloodstream infections are limited by toxicity and/or differential efficacy against MRSA and MSSA, which makes the choice of empirical therapy difficult. New management strategies are required to address the challenges raised by S. aureus bloodstream infections and MRSA in particular. These may include the use of techniques that allow the early identification of complications arising from S. aureus bacteraemia, rapid pathogen identification to enable the administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy, and the identification of new drugs with novel modes of action that may circumvent antibiotic resistance and enable effective empirical treatment of both MSSA and MRSA infections.

### How I manage a patient with MRSA bacteraemia [^116McRrj]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections are common and associated with a high mortality of 15–25%. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infection accounts for 10–40% of cases, and has an even higher mortality. Despite being the 'bread and butter' of clinical infectious diseases practice, robust evidence to guide optimal management is often lacking and there is wide variation in practice.

Objectives

To provide a real-world example of a case of MRSA bacteraemia and the thought processes of the authors as key management decision points are reached.

Sources

The discussion is based on recent literature searches of relevant topics. In making recommendations, randomized clinical trial data have been prioritized and highlighted, and where these are not available recommendations are based on the experience and opinions of the authors.

Content

For a patient with MRSA bacteraemia and a primary bone and joint infection the following points are discussed: empirical antibiotic choice for suspected S. aureus bacteraemia; directed antibiotic choice for MRSA; monitoring and dosing of vancomycin; the role of combination therapy when bacteraemia is persistent; and the duration of therapy and role of switching to oral antibiotics.

Implications

While broad principles of aggressive source control and appropriate choice and duration of antibiotics are important, the heterogeneity of S. aureus bacteraemia means that a tailored rather than algorithmic approach to management is often required. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to strengthen the evidence base for the management of MRSA bacteraemia.

### Serious infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^111up4Zy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Although first identified just > 4 decades ago, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has undergone rapid evolutionary changes and epidemiologic expansion to become a major cause of nosocomial and community-acquired infections worldwide. Increasing resistance to vancomycin among MRSA strains in conjunction with availability of new antibiotics, including daptomycin and linezolid, have increased treatment choices but made clinical treatment decisions more challenging. This article describes the clinical features and management issues of 2 challenging-to-treat manifestations of MRSA infection, bacteremia and/or endocarditis and osteomyelitis. It also presents a brief review of community-associated MRSA infections and preventive strategies directed against MRSA.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^117V1x89]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) empiric therapy — S. aureus coverage and MRSA/MSSA selection is as follows: For patients being treated empirically for HAP, we recommend prescribing an antibiotic with activity against S. aureus (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have either a risk factor for MRSA infection (ie, prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days, hospitalization in a unit where > 20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant, or the prevalence of MRSA is not known, or who are at high risk for mortality, we suggest prescribing an antibiotic with activity against MRSA (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Risk factors for mortality include need for ventilatory support due to HAP and septic shock. For patients with HAP who require empiric coverage for MRSA, we recommend vancomycin or linezolid rather than an alternative antibiotic (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have no risk factors for MRSA infection and are not at high risk of mortality, we suggest prescribing an antibiotic with activity against MSSA, and when empiric treatment that includes coverage for MSSA (and not MRSA) is indicated, we suggest a regimen including piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem.

### Bacteremia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: new therapeutic approaches [^1156vTRT]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

This article reviews recent clinical evidence for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Vancomycin remains the initial antibiotic of choice for the treatment of patients with MRSA bacteremia and endocarditis due to isolates with vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration ≤ 2 μg/mL, whereas daptomycin is an effective alternative, and ceftaroline seems promising. Treatment options for persistent MRSA bacteremia or bacteremia due to vancomycin-intermediate or vancomycin-resistant strains include daptomycin, ceftaroline, and combination therapies. There is a critical need for high-level evidence from clinical trials to allow optimally informed decisions in the treatment of MRSA bacteremia and endocarditis.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^113u4pih]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) empiric therapy — methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) versus methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) coverage is guided by on-admission risk factors and mortality risk. For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have either a risk factor for MRSA infection (ie, prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days, hospitalization in a unit where > 20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant, or the prevalence of MRSA is not known), or who are at high risk for mortality, we suggest prescribing an antibiotic with activity against MRSA (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Risk factors for mortality include need for ventilatory support due to HAP and septic shock. For patients with HAP who require empiric coverage for MRSA, we recommend vancomycin or linezolid rather than an alternative antibiotic (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have no risk factors for MRSA infection and are not at high risk of mortality, we suggest prescribing an antibiotic with activity against MSSA; when empiric coverage for MSSA (and not MRSA) is indicated, we suggest a regimen including piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem, and oxacillin, nafcillin, or cefazolin are preferred for the treatment of proven MSSA, but are not necessary for empiric coverage of HAP if one of the above agents is used (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). The 20% threshold for deciding whether or not to target MRSA or MSSA was chosen in an effort to balance the need for effective initial antibiotic therapy against the risks of excessive antibiotic use; when implementing these recommendations, individual units may elect to modify this threshold.

### 2015 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of native vertebral osteomyelitis in adults [^117PB92X]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

2015 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline — native vertebral osteomyelitis (NVO) in adults — notes that NVO is often the result of hematogenous seeding of the adjacent disc space from a distant focus, as the disc is avascular, and the diagnosis can often be delayed several months and initially misdiagnosed as a degenerative process. NVO is typically diagnosed in the setting of recalcitrant back pain unresponsive to conservative measures and elevated inflammatory markers with or without fever. Radiographs of the spine are not sensitive for the early diagnosis of NVO, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine is often required to establish the diagnosis. Except in septic patients or patients with neurologic compromise, empiric antimicrobial therapy should be withheld, when possible, until a microbiologic diagnosis is confirmed; an image-guided or intraoperative aspiration or biopsy of a disc space or vertebral endplate sample submitted for microbiologic and pathologic examination often establishes the microbiologic or pathologic diagnosis of NVO. NVO is commonly monomicrobial and most frequently due to Staphylococcus aureus, and the concomitant presence of S. aureus bloodstream infection within the preceding 3 months and compatible spine MRI changes preclude the need for a disc space aspiration in most patients. Definitive therapy should be based on the results of culture and in vitro susceptibility testing, and the majority of patients are cured with a 6-week course of antimicrobial therapy.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Antimicrobial management when the microbial etiology is not identified — acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO): Culture-negative AHO is frequent, with reports documenting 40 (47%) of the 85 children, 46 (35%) of the 131 children, and 877 (42.6%) of the 2060 children in 56 hospitals, and initial empiric therapy is selected based on local epidemiology and resistance patterns. In children empirically treated for community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) who improve, a switch to methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA)-active agents may be considered for definitive therapy with close observation. If vancomycin is started empirically, options include completing a full parenteral course or switching to an oral agent, and vancomycin can be considered for the entire course if CA-MRSA is likely and the perceived benefits outweigh risks. Clindamycin is a common equivalent oral option after initial vancomycin, but local clindamycin-resistance among MRSA and MSSA should be considered because resistance varies widely, ranging from 5% to 40%; less well-studied oral options for CA-MRSA include linezolid and TMP-SMX.

### Practice patterns of providers for the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in children: results of an emerging infections network survey [^111RFxV6]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

METHODS

From January to February 2017, we distributed a 7-question, electronic, vignette-based survey (Supplementary Data,) of clinical scenarios related to the management of SAB in children to PID providers in the Emerging Infections Network of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA EIN).

The survey questions explored diagnostic and treatment practices of providers for patients with osteomyelitis-associated SAB, nonpersistent SAB (< 48 h), persistent MRSA bacteremia, peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)-associated thrombosis with SAB, and parenteral treatment of choice for MSSA bacteremia.

Demographic information regarding practice region, experience, and employment was collected by EIN membership profile. Similar to previous EIN surveys, the response rate was calculated from PID EIN members who had ever responded to a survey. Descriptive statistics were calculated as percentages for each response category.

### Practice patterns of providers for the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in children: results of an emerging infections network survey [^115Cka8X]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of bacteremia in children; however, optimal management of these patients remains unclear. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) bacteremia recommend vancomycin therapy for up to 6 weeks, depending on the source and clinical response. Guidelines for the treatment of methicillin- susceptible S aureus (MSSA) bacteremia recommend nafcillin as first-line therapy, with cefazolin as an alternative.

Despite these recommendations, the application of broad guidelines to specific scenarios encountered in the management of S aureus bacteremia (SAB) in children remains difficult. Recent literature has challenged long-held notions regarding optimal management of SAB associated with osteoarticular infections; however, there remains a paucity of evidence to guide management in several other common scenarios including the following: nonpersistent SAB without a source, prolonged MRSA bacteremia, and central-line associated SAB. Given the complexity in the management of children with SAB, we sought to describe practice patterns and clinical decision making among pediatric infectious diseases (PID) providers.

### Practice patterns of providers for the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in children: results of an emerging infections network survey [^111BLdS5]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Two hundred twenty-three of 334 (67%) clinicians with a PID practice responded from the United States and Canada, most (37%) having 5–14 years of clinical experience, and the majority practicing at a university hospital (62%). Fourteen (6%) providers do not manage children with SAB and were excluded from the analysis.

Osteomyelitis-Associated Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia

For children with osteomyelitis-associated SAB showing clinical improvement shortly after initiation of antibiotics, almost all (97%) providers routinely repeat blood cultures until negative, whereas a minority routinely image the heart (29%), abdomen (3%), retina (6%), or vasculature (eg, Doppler ultrasound, 12%) (Figure 1A). Figure 1B shows the various treatment approaches taken by pediatric providers, with half (50%) treating intravenously only for those with persistent bacteremia (> 48–72 hours), whereas 28% treat almost all patients with 10–14 days of intravenous (IV) antibiotics and 22% treat with oral antibiotics once they have clinically improved (ie, no minimum duration of parenteral therapy). For those with MSSA bacteremia, nafcillin and cefazolin are used similarly (Figure 1C).

Practice patterns among providers for the workup and treatment of osteomyelitis-associated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB). (A) Diagnostic workup for a child with osteomyelitis-associated SAB that is improving shortly after antibiotic initiation. Almost all providers repeat blood cultures until negative; however, the minority will routinely look for other foci of infection. (B) For the treatment of osteomyelitis-associated SAB, 50% of providers will switch to an oral regimen for nonpersistent bacteremia. Twenty-eight percent and 22% will treat with all intravenous antibiotics or treat with oral antibiotics after clinical improvement, respectively. (C) For the treatment methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia with osteomyelitis, 55% of clinicians use nafcillin, 42% use cefazolin, and 3% use an alternative agent.

Nonpersistent Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia

For febrile, well appearing children with only 1 S aureus blood culture, no clear source of infection, and subsequent negative cultures before antibiotics, 54% of providers treat with oral antibiotics after empiric vancomycin; 25% complete therapy with IV antibiotics, and 17% discontinue antibiotics, assuming that S aureus is a contaminant. A small proportion (4%) of providers chose an alternative management strategy, including evaluating for a source of infection (3%).

### Antibiotic treatment of common infections: more evidence to support shorter durations [^117CG1H8]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although there is increasing recognition of the link between antibiotic overuse and antimicrobial resistance, clinician prescribing is often unnecessarily long and motivated by fear of clinical relapse. High-quality evidence supporting shorter treatment durations is needed to give clinicians confidence to change prescribing habits. Here we summarize recent randomized controlled trials investigating antibiotic short courses for common infections in adult patients.

Recent Findings

Randomized trials in the last five years have demonstrated noninferiority of short-course therapy for a range of conditions including community acquired pneumonia, intraabdominal sepsis, gram-negative bacteraemia and vertebral osteomyelitis.

Summary

Treatment durations for many common infections have been based on expert opinion rather than randomized trials. There is now evidence to support shorter courses of antibiotic therapy for many conditions.

Catheter-related bloodstream infection

Question

What is the most effective approach and antibiotic therapy for the management of CRBSI?

Recommendation

Effective management of CRBSI involves timely diagnosis, prompt removal of vascular access if at all possible (source control), and appropriate antibiotic therapy for 7–14 days depending on the causative microorganism, as shown in table 3. Vancomycin plus a beta-lactam (such as piperacillin-tazobactam or a ceftazidime) is usually a good empiric regimen if the risk of ESBL is not high. Reference to the local antibiogram and hospital recommendations is recommended for the selection of empiric therapy.

Table 3
Summary of antibiotic durations for common ICU infections

Discussion

The diagnosis of CRBSI should be distinguished from secondary bacteremia due to other sources. Surveillance cultures for patients with central lines are not recommended when CRBSI is not suspected such as in an asymptomatic patient and should not be done when other cultures are more appropriate to evaluate for the clinically suspected infection (eg, respiratory cultures for a suspected pneumonia).

The choice of antibiotic therapy should be based on local susceptibility patterns and the severity of illness and should be de-escalated when culture data become available. The recommended duration of antibiotic therapy is 7 days for coagulase-negative staphylococci, 7 days for Gram-negative bacilli,14 days for S. aureus (unless a complicated infection is present); and 14 days for Candida (in the absence of retinitis or risk factors for it, as described in the 'Bacteremia' section). Examples of when a S. aureus infection is considered complicated include endocarditis, osteomyelitis, foreign body or implant, metastatic infection, low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), immunocompromise, and recurrent infection. An infectious disease consultation should be sought in S. aureus CRBSI.

The management described here applies to non-tunneled lines. When a CRBSI is suspected, the central line should be removed. Catheter salvage options when the line cannot reasonably be removed are beyond the scope of this text.

### Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections: definitions and treatment [^111sDnDT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus aureus is a serious infection associated with high morbidity and mortality and often results in metastatic infections such as infective endocarditis, which have a negative impact on patient outcomes. We review the importance of the use of precise definitions of uncomplicated bacteremia and complicated bacteremia and present a case study to highlight the need for prolonged treatment and close monitoring of patients with risk factors for complications associated with S. aureus bacteremia. Traditionally, the treatment of choice for S. aureus bacteremia has depended to a large extent on the methicillin susceptibility of the pathogen. New antibiotics with proven efficacy against both susceptible and resistant strains are particularly attractive for empirical therapy. The antimicrobial agents that are currently available for use in the treatment of both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia and the scientific evidence that forms a basis for the use of these agents for this indication are reviewed.

### Cloxacillin plus fosfomycin versus cloxacillin alone for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a randomized trial [^112Rufiq]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This open-label, phase III–IV superiority randomized clinical trial conducted in 19 Spanish hospitals aimed to evaluate whether the combination of cloxacillin and fosfomycin achieved better treatment success than cloxacillin alone in patients with MSSA bacteremia. The primary endpoint was chosen based on the recommendations of international experts that proposed primary endpoints for use in clinical trials comparing treatment options for bloodstream infections in adults. We chose day 7 for the primary endpoint as it seemed an appropriate timepoint to evaluate the effect of antibiotic treatment on the initial response and the early resolution of the infection.

The main finding of our trial is that cloxacillin plus fosfomycin did not achieve better treatment success at day 7 than cloxacillin alone among patients with MSSA bacteremia. Secondary endpoints, including adverse events leading to discontinuation of therapy, were similar in the two treatment groups, with the exception of persistent bacteremia at day 3, which was less common in the combination treatment arm.

The results of our study are in line with the findings of the few randomized clinical trials carried out to date assessing different antibiotic combinations, which have also failed to improve treatment success rates and outcomes in patients with MSSA bacteremia and endocarditis, as shown in a recent meta-analysis. A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (the ARREST trial)conducted in 29 hospitals in the United Kingdom evaluated whether adjunctive rifampicin improved the outcomes of adult patients with S. aureus bacteremia, of whom 6% had infection with methicillin-resistant strains. In that trial, adjunctive rifampicin provided no overall benefit over standard antibiotic therapy in terms of avoiding treatment failure, disease recurrence, or death at 12 weeks after randomization. Moreover, a recent randomized controlled trial performed at two hospitals in Canada evaluating the efficacy of adjunctive daptomycin given with either cloxacillin or cefazolin for the treatment of MSSA bacteremia found that it did not shorten the duration of bacteremia (the primary endpoint) and did not improve 90-day mortality.

### Clinical characteristics and therapeutic outcomes of hematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^114xTRg9]. The Journal of Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the clinical characteristics and therapeutic outcomes of patients with hematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis (HVO) caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

Methods

We performed a cohort study of adult patients diagnosed with S. aureus HVO at a tertiary-care hospital over a 7-year period.

Results

Of the 139 patients with S. aureus HVO, MRSA caused 62 (44.6%) cases. In multivariate analysis, compared with methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), MRSA was associated with a higher risk of persistent bacteremia (≥ 7 days) (8.40 fold; P < 0.001) and relapse (4.83 fold; P = 0.03), and increased hospital stay (1.69 fold; P = 0.001). Among the MRSA cases, relapse rates differed according to duration of antibiotics: 41.7% (4–6 weeks), 25.0% (6–8 weeks), and 5.6% (≥ 8 weeks) (P = 0.007). Bacteremia was more likely to persist for ≥ 7 days in patients with an initial vancomycin trough < 15 mg/L than in those with an initial trough ≥ 15 mg/L (79.3% vs. 20.0%; P = 0.001).

Conclusions

MRSA HVO was associated with more frequent persistent bacteremia (≥ 7 days) and relapse, and longer hospital stay compared to MSSA HVO. Antibiotic therapy for ≥ 8 weeks and targeting a vancomycin trough of ≥ 15 mg/L may be benefit patients with MRSA HVO.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) — MSSA-directed empiric and targeted therapy: Patients with HAP who have no risk factors for either MRSA infection or a poor clinical outcome may receive an empiric regimen that includes an antibiotic targeting MSSA. Some agents used for HAP due to activity against P. aeruginosa and gram-negative bacilli are also suitable for empiric MSSA coverage — these include piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, and meropenem — and an empiric regimen that includes one of these does not require an additional MSSA agent. If infection with MSSA alone is confirmed, oxacillin, nafcillin, and cefazolin are narrow-spectrum intravenous antibiotics that are optimal for treating MSSA.

Antimicrobial therapy duration and route in native vertebral osteomyelitis (NVO) — We recommend a total duration of 6 weeks of parenteral or highly bioavailable oral antimicrobial therapy for most patients with bacterial NVO (strong, low), and We recommend a total duration of 3 months of antimicrobial therapy for most patients with NVO due to Brucella species (strong, moderate). Evidence includes a randomized trial showing that 6 weeks is noninferior to 12 weeks, with clinical cure in 160 of 176 (90.9%) in the 6-week group and 159 of 175 (90.9%) in the 12-week group. In an observational comparison of early oral switch versus prolonged parenteral therapy, the early-switch regimen used a median duration of intravenous treatment of 12 days followed by 42 days of oral therapy versus a prolonged parenteral course of 42 days intravenous followed by 21 days oral, with success rates 69% (prolonged intravenous) versus 78% (early switch). Parenteral antimicrobial therapy is the standard for most gram-positive and selected gram-negative microorganisms, but oral agents with excellent bioavailability (including fluoroquinolones, linezolid, and metronidazole) allow the possibility of an early switch without compromising efficacy; Oral β-lactams should not be prescribed for the initial treatment of NVO. Selected panel members advocate longer treatment for > 6 weeks followed by oral therapy for 3 months or longer in patients perceived to be at high risk for failure (for example, MRSA or extensive infection).

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

Which Empirical Antimicrobial Agents Are Preferred for Osteomyelitis?

Based on data from observational studies, if antibiotic therapy cannot be delayed until culture availability, it is reasonable to empirically cover aerobic gram-positive cocci, especially S aureus, and gram-negative bacilli (Table 2; eTable 2 in Supplement 2). Many practitioners routinely provide anaerobic coverage for DFO; however, comparative data are not available to establish the clinical benefit or harm of this approach. Inclusion of empirical therapy targeting methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa depends on the presence of specific risk factors (addressed below). In all cases, local susceptibility patterns, patient-specific risk factors, and prior culture data influence the choice of antibiotic selection. Culture results can be used to tailor empirical therapy when possible.

Table 2.
Reasonable Empirical Antimicrobial Therapy Options With Published Data a

Abbreviations: PJI, prosthetic joint infection; TMP-SMX, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

When Should Antimicrobial Coverage Targeting MRSA Be Included?

Based on culture data from observational studies, inclusion of empirical anti-MRSA coverage depends on local prevalence and patient-specific risk factors, such as known colonization status (which is the biggest individual risk factor), prior positive cultures, and health care exposure. In a setting with low MRSA incidence, no known MRSA colonization or prior positive cultures, and minimal health care contact, it is reasonable to withhold empirical MRSA coverage.

When Should Antimicrobial Coverage Against P Aeruginosa Be Included?

Based on culture data from observational studies, routine use of empirical antipseudomonal therapy for osteomyelitis is unnecessary. Such agents are added in the presence of specific risk factors, including patients with chronic wounds who have: (1) been exposed to multiple prior courses of antibiotics; (2) previously had cultures positive for P aeruginosa; (3) gangrenous wounds; (4) had a recent surgical procedure (eg, within 3 months, as with early PJI); or (5) specific sites of infection particularly associated with pseudomonal infection (eg, malignant otitis externa).

Does Bone Penetration of an Antimicrobial Agent Matter Clinically, and Should It Be Used to Select Therapy?

Outcome data related to antibiotic bone penetration are limited for osteomyelitis. Thus, theoretical bone penetration (eTable 3 in Supplement 2) is not the primary driver of antibiotic selection; published clinical outcomes data are more relevant.

### Diagnosis and management of osteomyelitis [^114Dz5TF]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The incidence of chronic osteomyelitis is increasing because of the prevalence of predisposing conditions such as diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease. The increased availability of sensitive imaging tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging and bone scintigraphy, has improved diagnostic accuracy and the ability to characterize the infection. Plain radiography is a useful initial investigation to identify alternative diagnoses and potential complications. Direct sampling of the wound for culture and antimicrobial sensitivity is essential to target treatment. The increased incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus osteomyelitis complicates antibiotic selection. Surgical debridement is usually necessary in chronic cases. The recurrence rate remains high despite surgical intervention and long-term antibiotic therapy. Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in children typically can be treated with a four-week course of antibiotics. In adults, the duration of antibiotic treatment for chronic osteomyelitis is typically several weeks longer. In both situations, however, empiric antibiotic coverage for S. aureus is indicated.

### Practice patterns of providers for the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in children: results of an emerging infections network survey [^114kCttQ]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study provides insights on the variation in the management of children with S aureus bacteremia. Notably, we found very little agreement in (1) the optimal route of antibiotics for children with osteomyelitis-associated SAB and nonpersistent SAB, (2) choice of antibiotic for MSSA bacteremia, (3) antibiotic approach in children with persistent MRSA bacteremia on vancomycin, and (4) optimal duration of antibiotics for PICC-associated thrombus and SAB.

These results highlight the complexity in caring for children with SAB and current gaps in consensus guidelines for the optimal management of these patients. Clinicians often encounter scenarios with little data to support treatment decisions, or they are forced to extrapolate data from adult studies. In children with SAB, however, the mortality, pathophysiology, and antibiotic pharmacokinetics are quite different than adults. The IDSA guidelines for MRSA bacteremia recommend echocardiography for all adult patients, whereas in children this is only recommended for those with congenital heart disease, persistent bacteremia (> 48–72 hours), or clinical findings suggestive of endocarditis. Our results reflect this recommendation because less than one third of providers routinely obtain an echocardiogram in a clinically improving child with SAB (Figure 1A). Notably, for a vignette describing bacteremia in a child with significant atopic dermatitis, 17% of respondents chose to discontinue antibiotics, assuming that S aureus was a contaminant — a recommendation at odds with the Committee on Infectious Diseases recommendation that " S. aureus almost never is a contaminant when isolated from a blood culture". Although it is certainly biologically plausible that a positive blood culture for S aureus could be a result of skin contamination, particularly in atopic dermatitis with or without cutaneous S aureus infection, there is historic precedent to treat these children with a short course of parenteral antibiotics. Whether this is suitable in practice is thus far unstudied and merits further discussion in subsequent guideline revisions.

Native vertebral osteomyelitis — definition and rates of treatment failure are anchored in microbiologic confirmation: The most specific measure of treatment failure is microbiologically confirmed persistent infection despite receipt of targeted antimicrobial therapy for an appropriate duration, and microbiologically confirmed treatment failure rates occur in 0%–11% of NVO patients in contemporary cohorts. Ascribing treatment failure to NVO patients in the absence of microbiologic evidence may lead to overestimation of treatment failure and predispose patients to potentially unnecessary medical and surgical interventions.

Given the limitations of currently approved treatments, other options are being developed. Vaccines targeting one or more S. aureus antigens have had minimal success to date and are reviewed elsewhere. Several studies have evaluated alternative antibacterials, including ceftaroline, linezolid, and quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D), although none have been approved for treatment of MRSA bacteremia. Ceftaroline is indicated for treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia caused by S. aureus, but is often used off-label to treat SAB. A recent multicenter study found that approximately 70% of patients with MRSA bacteremia experienced clinical success when ceftaroline was used as a salvage therapy alone or in combination with another antistaphylococcal antibiotic. Clinical trials of ceftaroline compared to other MRSA bacteremia antimicrobials are still needed. Linezolid, indicated for pneumonia and complicated and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by S. aureus, was effective as a salvage therapy for MRSA bacteremia. It is bacteriostatic against staphylococci, while the other treatments are bactericidal. Quinupristin/dalfopristin is indicated for treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) caused by MSSA, but is known to have in vitro activity against MRSA. In a study using Q/D as salvage therapy for 12 patients with MRSA or methicillin-resistant S. epidermis infections that did not respond to vancomycin, five of seven MRSA bacteremic patients showed eradication of the bacteria. Telavancin is approved for use in Gram-positive cSSSI and hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP), and it is currently being evaluated for treatment of S. aureus bacteremia in a phase 3 trial (NCT02208063). In the clinical trials comparing telavancin to vancomycin, clinical cure rates for patients with cSSSI or HABP/VABP with baseline MRSA bacteremia were 61.5 and 52.4% for telavancin-treated patients and 50.0 and 37.5% in vancomycin-treated patients, respectively. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole has also been suggested as an alternative treatment; however, it failed to meet noninferiority criteria compared with vancomycin in several trials of severe MRSA infections, including SAB.

Recommendation

Management of bacteremia includes prompt initiation of antibiotics at an appropriate dose based on a priori knowledge of guidelines, prompt microbial identification, and source control wherever possible. Empiric coverage may include piperacillin-tazobactam or cefepime plus metronidazole or a carbapenem (if concern for ESBL) with vancomycin or daptomycin. The recommended duration is 7 days for Gram-negatives and coagulase-negative staphylococci, and 14 days for MRSA and Candida species, and longer for complicated and resistant infections, immunocompromised patients, as well as endocarditis and osteomyelitis, as shown in table 3. For S. aureus bacteremia, an ID consultation should be considered. Stepdown to oral antibiotics is appropriate based on organism identified, severity of illness, and suspected source.

### Outcomes of partial oral antibiotic treatment for complicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in people who inject drugs [^116L41sC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus aureus represents the leading cause of complicated bloodstream infections among persons who inject drugs (PWID). Standard of care (SOC) intravenous (IV) antibiotics result in high rates of treatment success but are not feasible for some PWID. Transition to oral antibiotics may represent an alternative treatment option.

Methods

We evaluated all adult patients with a history of injection drug use hospitalized from January 2016 through December 2021 with complicated S. aureus bloodstream infections, including infective endocarditis, epidural abscess, vertebral osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis. Patients were compared by antibiotic treatment (standard of care intravenous [SOC IV] antibiotics, incomplete IV therapy, or transition from initial IV to partial oral) using the primary composite endpoint of death or readmission from microbiologic failure within 90 days of discharge.

Results

Patients who received oral antibiotics after an incomplete IV antibiotic course were significantly less likely to experience microbiologic failure or death than patients discharged without oral antibiotics (P < .001). There was no significant difference in microbiologic failure rates when comparing patients who were discharged on partial oral antibiotics after receiving at least 10 days of IV antibiotics with SOC regimens (P > .9).

Conclusions

Discharge of PWID with partially treated complicated S. aureus bacteremias without oral antibiotics results in high rates of morbidity and should be avoided. For PWID hospitalized with complicated S. aureus bacteremias who have received at least 10 days of effective IV antibiotic therapy after clearance of bacteremia, transition to oral antibiotics with outpatient support represents a potential alternative if the patient does not desire SOC IV antibiotic therapy.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia additional directives and caveats from Table 4 are as follows: If MRSA coverage is not going to be used, include coverage for MSSA. Options include: Piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, meropenem. Oxacillin, nafcillin, and cefazolin are preferred for the treatment of proven MSSA, but would ordinarily not be used in an empiric regimen for HAP. If patient has severe penicillin allergy and aztreonam is going to be used instead of any β-lactam–based antibiotic, include coverage for MSSA. If patient has factors increasing the likelihood of gram-negative infection, 2 antipseudomonal agents are recommended, and if patient has structural lung disease increasing the risk of gram-negative infection (ie, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis), 2 antipseudomonal agents are recommended. In the absence of other options, it is acceptable to use aztreonam as an adjunctive agent with another β-lactam–based agent because it has different targets within the bacterial cell wall.

### Cloxacillin plus fosfomycin versus cloxacillin alone for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a randomized trial [^114PNijE]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Main

Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of life-threatening community-acquired and healthcare-associated bacteremia. The incidence of S. aureus bacteremia is increasing, ranging from 10 to 30 per 100,000 person-years. The mortality rate associated with S. aureus bacteremia remains particularly high, ranging from 20% to 33% at 90 days, and is a matter of great concern. This high mortality rate may be attributed to various factors, including increasing age and a higher frequency of comorbid conditions. A poor prognosis of S. aureus bacteremia has also been linked to high-risk sources of infection, particularly endocarditis, pneumonia and cases of unknown origin. Furthermore, persistent and complicated S. aureus bacteremia presents a major mortality risk, with each day of persistent bacteremia associated with a 16% increase in risk of death.

Anti-staphylococcal beta-lactam monotherapy is currently considered the standard of care for the treatment of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) bacteremia. However, treatment failure and mortality rates in MSSA bacteremia remain unacceptably high. Consequently, there is growing interest in identifying new therapeutic regimens capable of reducing treatment failure and improving outcomes obtained with cloxacillin monotherapy. Experimental and clinical studies have found several antibiotic combinations that have a synergistic effect, leading to increased bactericidal activity, higher biofilm penetration and a reduced incidence of antibiotic resistance during the treatment of S. aureus infection. Nevertheless, a recent meta-analysis concluded that the combination antibiotic therapies that have been assessed in patients with MSSA not only failed to reduce mortality, but actually increased the risk of adverse events in humans.

The combination of cloxacillin and fosfomycin is an appealing option for the treatment of MSSA bacteremia. Fosfomycin inhibits the synthesis of N -acetylmuramic acid, a precursor of bacterial wall peptidoglycan, and is highly bactericidal against S. aureus. Interestingly, the addition of fosfomycin to cloxacillin and several other beta-lactam combinations have been shown to have a synergistic effect in vitro, in animal models and in small-scale clinical observational studies. To date, however, the use of adjunctive fosfomycin for the treatment of MSSA bacteremia has not been evaluated in a randomized clinical trial.

We conducted an open-label, multicenter, phase III–IV superiority randomized clinical trial (the SAFO trial) to assess whether cloxacillin plus fosfomycin administered for the initial 7 days of therapy achieves better treatment success than cloxacillin alone in hospitalized patients with MSSA bacteremia.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) — Empiric anti-staphylococcal coverage is prioritized, and empiric therapy with an anti-staphylococcal antibiotic is essential; in regions where the prevalence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) causing pediatric AHO is low, cefazolin or oxacillin/nafcillin is preferred for empiric therapy of presumed methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), whereas for regions with CA-MRSA prevalence 10% to 20% or greater, clindamycin or vancomycin is preferred; for clinically stable children, cefazolin is reasonable empiric therapy pending cultures or when close observation is appropriate; when clindamycin resistance in MRSA is substantial (approximately 10% to 20% or greater), vancomycin is preferred for empiric therapy for CA-MRSA; selection should be guided by local antibiotic resistance patterns and/or hospital antibiogram and disease severity; other CA-MRSA–active agents exist but data are insufficient to suggest routine therapy, and despite in vitro activity of many antibiotics, the lack of dosing, outcomes, and safety data does not permit recommendations for their routine use at this time.

### Cloxacillin plus fosfomycin versus cloxacillin alone for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a randomized trial [^112D5LdR]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Our study has limitations. The first is the open-label design, which may have introduced a bias in the assessment of treatment success. Nevertheless, this limitation was mitigated by including objective data in the composite primary endpoint, which was also adjudicated by an independent committee blinded to treatment allocation. It should be noted that our trial mainly focused on treatment effect during the first 7 days (when fosfomycin was administered in the combination treatment arm) and assessed relevant secondary endpoints at TOC (12 weeks after randomization). Therefore, we cannot rule out disease recurrence or relapse occurring beyond 12 weeks after randomization. Unfortunately, there are no standardized primary endpoints to be used in trials comparing different strategies for antibiotic treatment of MSSA bacteremia, and efforts should be made to reach consensus regarding the endpoints that should be used in future trials. Another limitation of our study is that it was conducted in a single country, and its findings might not be generalizable to other populations. Furthermore, when enrollment of half of the sample size had been achieved, the independent committee raised no concerns regarding safety, but mentioned the differences between the success rate specified in the sample size calculation and the rate observed in the planned interim analysis, and recommended ceasing patient recruitment owing to futility. Moreover, the number of patients who had high-risk MSSA bacteremia was relatively low, and the trial was not powered to detect survival differences. Finally, our trial did not include patients with prosthetic endocarditis, therefore we cannot draw conclusions about the hypothetical benefits of adjunctive fosfomycin in this setting.

In conclusion, cloxacillin plus fosfomycin did not achieve better treatment success at day 7 of therapy than cloxacillin alone in hospitalized adult patients with MSSA bacteremia. Further large randomized controlled trials should be conducted to evaluate new strategies of treatment aimed at improving outcomes in patients with MSSA bacteremia. Ideally, these trials should be designed taking into account the intrinsic heterogeneity of the infection, by using a more stratified and personalized approach and by including a long-term follow-up.

Native vertebral osteomyelitis (NVO) — timing of empiric antimicrobial therapy — notes that in patients with normal and stable neurologic examination and stable hemodynamics, we suggest holding empiric antimicrobial therapy until a microbiologic diagnosis is established (weak, low), whereas in patients with hemodynamic instability, sepsis, septic shock, or severe or progressive neurologic symptoms, we suggest the initiation of empiric antimicrobial therapy in conjunction with an attempt at establishing a microbiologic diagnosis (weak, low).

### Clinical progression of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus vertebral osteomyelitis associated with reduced susceptibility to daptomycin [^113fx8Ue]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

Daptomycin, a novel cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic, exhibits rapid bactericidal activity in vitro against most clinically relevant gram-positive organisms, including drug-resistant pathogens. Herein we describe a patient in whom methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with reduced susceptibility to daptomycin was responsible for bacteremia and progressive vertebral osteomyelitis during daptomycin therapy.

Discussion

The incidence of sternal wound infection after cardiac surgery is reported to be 0.4–5% and Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen isolated from sternal wound infections after cardiac surgery as well as from bacteraemic blood cultures. An increasing trend in antibiotic resistance, with the appearance of progressively more cases of MRSA strain infections have been shown in epidemiological studies. Sternal infection with S. aureus is associated with high morbidity and mortality and carries a worse prognosis than that of other aetiologies.

Vancomycin remains the reference standard for the treatment of systemic infection caused by methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). However, there are many reasons for clinical failure of Vancomycin, therefore the need for alternative therapies that target MRSA has become apparent. One alternative is Linezolid, because it has been shown that this antibiotic drug in retrospective evaluations of complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) caused by MRSA, compared with Vancomycin, is associated with significantly higher clinical cure rates and reduced lengths of hospitalization. Despite the apparent advantages of Linezolid in the treatment of MRSA infections, concerns about safety and costs of therapy often limit its use.

Daptomycin is a lipopeptide drug with bactericidal activity against MRSA in a concentration-dependent manner. The difference between Daptomycin and standard therapy in the treatment of MRSA infections was up to now not statistically significant, however Daptomycin has already been proven to be effective in the treatment of bacteremia and endocarditis caused by MRSA and several case reports about its effectiveness in the field of cardiac surgery exist in the literature. Based on these observations, Daptomycin may offer a possible new treatment option for surgical management of MRSA sternal wound infection after cardiac surgery combined with surgical therapy.

In our case the patient was re-submitted to our hospital with generalized colonization and infection with MRSA. Standard therapy concerning antibiotic treatment has failed to eradicate the MRSA, so that we decided for an alternative antimicrobial strategy in the form of Daptomycin application. However, its longterm efficacy in cardiac surgery should be further evaluated in a controlled setting.

### Recent lessons for the management of bone and joint infections [^115xnZTp]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

The epidemiology and clinical manifestations of osteoarticular infections are changing primarily as a result of the emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. Multifocal disease, venous thrombosis and pathologic fractures are manifestations of CA-MRSA osteomyelitis. MRI is the diagnostic imaging modality of choice for musculoskeletal infections. Nafcillin/oxacillin or cefazolin remains the antibiotic of choice for treating infections caused by MSSA. A β-lactam antibiotic is recommended for Kingella kingae. Vancomycin and clindamycin are the first line agents for treating osteomyelitis caused by CA-MRSA. A short course of parenteral antibiotics followed by appropriate oral antibiotics is equivalent to total course of parenteral antibiotics for most patients and avoids the risks associated with PICCs. Surgical drainage of subperiosteal abscesses and surrounding pyomyositis is common with S. aureus clones currently circulating. Collaboration with hematologists for managing patients with venous thromboses is recommended.

### Time for a change: considering vancomycin alternatives for pediatric methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [^116tzX7C]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2023). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin remains the standard of care for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia in pediatrics largely because no alternative antibiotic is definitively superior. Long-standing historical precedent and S. aureus' notable lack of vancomycin resistance are clear benefits, but vancomycin's use remains plagued by nephrotoxicity and the need for therapeutic drug monitoring, with inadequate consensus on how best to dose or monitor vancomycin in pediatrics. Daptomycin, ceftaroline, and linezolid are all promising alternatives, with improved safety relative to vancomycin. However, inadequate and variable efficacy data limit confidence in their use. Despite this, we contend that it is time for clinicians to reconsider vancomycin's place in clinical use. In this review, we summarize the supporting data for using vancomycin versus these other anti-MRSA antibiotics, present a framework for antibiotic decision-making that considers patient-specific factors, and discuss approaches to antibiotic selection for various etiologies of MRSA bacteremia. This review aims to help pediatric clinicians choose among the various treatment options for MRSA bacteremia, acknowledging that the optimal antibiotic choice is sometimes uncertain.

Antimicrobial management in AHO when microbial etiology is identified notes that for MSSA isolates, first-generation cephalosporins (eg, cefazolin) or ASP (eg, oxacillin and nafcillin) are the preferred parenteral agents, and excellent outcomes with the transition to oral therapy with high-dose cephalexin or clindamycin are well documented; for MSSA infections, the safety and tolerability benefits of beta-lactam therapy are likely to be greater than glycopeptides (vancomycin), lincosamides (clindamycin), and oxazolidinones (linezolid), but no controlled data comparing efficacy, tolerability, and adverse event profiles between agents have been collected specifically in children with AHO. For CA-MRSA isolates that are susceptible, clindamycin is the preferred agent, with tolerability and safety benefits greater than vancomycin, the ability to convert readily from parenteral to oral therapy due to good enteral bioavailability, and potential adherence improved by adding flavoring to the liquid formulation. Vancomycin remains the preferred initial antimicrobial agent for clindamycin-resistant CA-MRSA infections, and other MRSA-active agents may be considered as alternatives (eg, ceftaroline, daptomycin, linezolid, and TMP-SMX) but have been used less often than vancomycin for the treatment of AHO; few published data exist for treatment outcomes, safety, tolerability, or standardized dosing of antimicrobial agents.

Oral antibiotic options for treating skin and soft-tissue infections in patients with community-associated MRSA include clindamycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, a tetracycline, and linezolid. Options for treating both β-hemolytic streptococci and community-associated MRSA include clindamycin alone, TMP/SMX or a tetracycline in combination with a beta-lactam antibiotic, or linezolid alone. Rifampin is not recommended for use as a single agent or adjunctive therapy. A beta-lactam antibiotic may be considered in hospitalized patients with nonpurulent cellulitis. MRSA-active therapy may be modified if there is no clinical response. Treatment for seven to 14 days is recommended, but should be individualized to the patient's clinical response.

Cultures from abscesses and other purulent infections are recommended in patients who have received antibiotic therapy, those with severe local infection or signs of systemic illness, and those who have not responded adequately to initial treatment. Cultures are also recommended if there is concern of a cluster or outbreak. Recommended treatment for adults with uncomplicated bacteremia includes vancomycin or daptomycin at a dosage of 6 mg per kg intravenously once per day for at least two weeks. For adults with complicated bacteremia, four to six weeks of therapy is recommended, depending on the extent of infection. Some experts recommend higher dosages of daptomycin. Antibiotic options for parenteral administration include intravenous vancomycin and daptomycin.

Antibiotic options with parenteral and oral routes of administration include the following: TMP/SMX in combination with rifampin, linezolid, and clindamycin. Some experts recommend adding oral rifampin to the chosen antibiotic. For patients with concurrent bacteremia, rifampin should be added after bacteremia has cleared.
