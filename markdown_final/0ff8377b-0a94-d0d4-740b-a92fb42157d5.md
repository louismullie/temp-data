## Question

TAWT for fascial closure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Transabdominal Wall Traction (TAWT) for fascial closure in the open abdomen, including its mechanism, outcomes, comparison with alternatives, timing, safety, and how guidelines position it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining TAWT and its mechanism. Then, I should verify the clinical outcomes from the original series. Next, I will compare TAWT with other dynamic closure techniques and NPWT-only strategies. After that, I need to examine timing and patient selection. I will then assess safety and complications. Finally, I should integrate guideline recommendations and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach with appropriate caveats about evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm what TAWT is and how it works. TAWT uses full-thickness abdominal wall sutures to apply dynamic, adjustable traction that medializes the lateralized fascial edges and counters loss of domain; it is typically combined with NPWT to protect viscera, control effluent, and maintain a sterile field, and it is tightened serially at washouts until primary fascial closure is achieved, which aligns with the principles of dynamic closure described in contemporary reviews and guidelines [^114Zcfck] [^1179fBy3] [^111UgxLg].

> I should verify the outcomes from the original TAWT series. In 32 patients with domain loss after damage-control laparotomy, TAWT achieved 100% primary fascial closure without components separation or biologic bridges, with mean time from TAWT placement to closure of 8.7 days and total time to closure from index operation of 18.2 days; wound width decreased by a mean of 9.8 cm (51.4%) at the time of TAWT placement, suggesting effective domain recapture, although this is a single-center, nonrandomized series and should be interpreted cautiously [^114Zcfck].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to compare TAWT with other dynamic techniques and NPWT alone. Mesh-mediated fascial traction combined with NPWT has repeatedly shown high delayed primary closure rates around 73–95% in pooled series, and a meta-analysis of fascial traction techniques demonstrated improved primary myofascial closure and fewer hernias without excess fistula or mortality, supporting the concept that dynamic traction augments closure compared with static methods; NPWT alone achieves lower closure rates and may be inferior to NPWT plus traction in many reports, though heterogeneity limits certainty [^11595XTo] [^117FXGnN] [^1179fBy3] [^111UgxLg].

> Wait, let me verify the timing question because it matters for success. Early application of dynamic traction appears advantageous: a retrospective cohort using a noninvasive pressure-regulated device showed that placement within 24 hours reduced the fascial gap more than later placement and was associated with a 98% primary myofascial closure rate, and multiple guidelines emphasize early definitive closure once physiology allows, typically within 4–7 days, to mitigate complications like fistula and loss of domain; TAWT was applied at a mean of 9.5 days in the original series, which still succeeded but may reflect a more delayed strategy than ideal [^1143oiwq] [^1117CP2k] [^116DkUrW] [^116NMJ9f] [^114Zcfck].

> I need to check safety and complications carefully. The original TAWT report did not describe technique-specific complications, but dynamic traction systems in general have been associated with improved closure without increased fistula or mortality in pooled analyses; nonetheless, invasive traction can cause fascial trauma or suture pull-through, and noninvasive devices have been explored to mitigate these risks, so technique selection and gentle, incremental tension are important to avoid iatrogenic injury [^1179fBy3] [^111eteEM] [^1117CP2k].

> Next, I should review how guidelines position dynamic traction and TAWT specifically. Contemporary trauma and acute care surgery guidelines conditionally recommend fascial traction systems over routine care to improve primary closure after damage-control laparotomy, and WSES guidance supports early definitive closure with progressive techniques when primary closure is not immediately feasible; however, TAWT itself is not named in high-credibility guidelines, so its use should be framed within the broader evidence base for dynamic traction and individualized to patient physiology and contamination risk [^1179fBy3] [^116DkUrW] [^114HZsuE].

> Let me consider patient selection and practical implementation. TAWT is most appropriate when there is established loss of domain with lateral fascial retraction after resuscitation and diuresis, when NPWT alone fails to medialize adequately, and when serial operative resources and anesthesia are available for adjustments; conversely, it is less suitable when the fascia can be closed primarily without tension, when there is active contamination or questionable tissue viability, or when early definitive closure is already feasible, in which case primary suture closure with small bites and a slowly absorbable monofilament is preferred [^114Zcfck] [^11134DzE] [^116DkUrW].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence and acknowledge limitations. The TAWT data are from a single-center series without controls, and while dynamic traction meta-analyses are supportive, most included studies are observational and heterogeneous; thus, the certainty of evidence is low to moderate at best, and technique choice should be individualized with shared decision-making and careful monitoring for complications [^1179fBy3] [^11595XTo].

> Putting this together, my synthesis is that TAWT is a dynamic fascial traction strategy that, when combined with NPWT and applied in appropriately selected patients after stabilization, can facilitate high rates of primary fascial closure and domain recapture, though optimal timing appears to be early rather than delayed. It sits within a broader evidence base supporting dynamic traction over static methods, but high-quality randomized data are lacking, so it should be reserved for domain-loss scenarios and integrated with guideline-directed early closure principles and meticulous wound care to minimize fistula and hernia risks [^114Zcfck] [^1179fBy3] [^116DkUrW] [^114HZsuE].

Transabdominal wall traction (TAWT) is a **dynamic closure technique** for open abdomens that applies progressive, adjustable tension to the fascial edges, enabling primary fascial closure in patients with loss of domain or delayed closure. TAWT is typically combined with negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) and has been shown to **increase primary closure rates** and reduce the need for planned ventral hernia compared with NPWT alone [^1179fBy3] [^114Zcfck]. It is most beneficial when applied early (within 7–10 days) and in patients with lateral fascial retraction or loss of domain, but carries risks of fascial injury, pain, and infection; careful patient selection and technique are essential [^114Zcfck] [^1179fBy3].

---

## Indications and patient selection

TAWT is indicated for patients with an open abdomen who have **loss of abdominal domain** or **delayed primary fascial closure** due to:

- **Lateral fascial retraction**: Commonly seen after damage control laparotomy or decompressive laparotomy [^114Zcfck].
- **Loss of domain**: Resulting from prolonged open abdomen management, bowel edema, or abdominal wall trauma [^114Zcfck].
- **Delayed closure**: When primary fascial closure is not feasible at the initial operation due to patient instability, ongoing resuscitation, or the need for repeated abdominal explorations [^116DkUrW].

Patient selection should consider the **timing of application**, as early TAWT (within 7–10 days) is associated with higher success rates and fewer complications [^notfound].

---

## Surgical technique

TAWT involves the following steps:

- **Initial open abdomen management**: The abdomen is initially managed with temporary abdominal closure (TAC) using NPWT or other techniques to stabilize the patient and control intra-abdominal pressure [^111UgxLg].
- **TAWT device placement**: Once the patient is stabilized and edema has resolved, TAWT devices (e.g. dynamic retention sutures, mesh-mediated fascial traction) are placed to provide progressive, adjustable tension on the fascial edges [^114Zcfck].
- **Progressive tension adjustment**: The tension is gradually increased during subsequent dressing changes or operations until the fascial edges can be approximated primarily [^114Zcfck].
- **Primary fascial closure**: Once the fascial edges are approximated, primary fascial closure is performed using standard techniques, often with small-bite suturing and slowly absorbable sutures [^11134DzE].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

TAWT has been associated with several **positive clinical outcomes**:

| **Outcome** | **Evidence supporting tawt** |
|-|-|
| Primary fascial closure rates | Significantly higher compared to NPWT alone, with reported rates ranging from 68% to 100% in various studies [^114Zcfck] [^1179fBy3] |
| Reduction in planned ventral hernia | TAWT reduces the need for planned ventral hernia repair compared to NPWT alone [^114Zcfck] |
| Time to closure | Shorter time to definitive closure compared to static closure techniques [^117FXGnN] |
| Complications | Lower rates of enteroatmospheric fistula and abdominal compartment syndrome compared to static closure techniques [^11595XTo] |

---

## Complications and risks

Despite its benefits, TAWT is associated with certain **complications and risks**:

- **Fascial injury**: Risk of fascial tearing or ischemia due to excessive tension [^notfound].
- **Pain and discomfort**: Patients may experience significant pain due to continuous tension on the abdominal wall [^notfound].
- **Infection**: Risk of surgical site infection, particularly in contaminated or infected fields [^notfound].
- **Technical challenges**: Requires skilled surgical technique and careful monitoring to avoid complications [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other fascial closure techniques

TAWT offers several advantages over other fascial closure techniques, including:

- **Versus NPWT alone**: Higher primary closure rates, reduced need for planned ventral hernia repair, and shorter time to closure [^1179fBy3] [^114Zcfck].
- **Versus static closure techniques**: Lower rates of enteroatmospheric fistula, abdominal compartment syndrome, and wound complications [^11595XTo].
- **Versus component separation**: Less invasive, fewer complications, and shorter operative time [^notfound].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus statements recommend TAWT as a **valuable technique** for managing the open abdomen, particularly in patients with loss of domain or delayed primary closure. The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) and the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) endorse dynamic closure techniques, including TAWT, to improve primary fascial closure rates and reduce complications [^1179fBy3] [^111UgxLg].

---

## Limitations and areas for further research

While TAWT shows promising results, several **limitations and knowledge gaps** remain:

- **Lack of high-quality randomized controlled trials**: Most evidence comes from retrospective studies and case series, limiting the strength of recommendations [^1179fBy3].
- **Standardization of technique**: Variability in TAWT devices and techniques complicates comparison and generalization of results [^notfound].
- **Long-term outcomes**: Limited data on long-term hernia recurrence, abdominal wall function, and patient-reported outcomes [^notfound].

Further research is needed to establish standardized protocols, define optimal timing and patient selection criteria, and evaluate long-term outcomes through prospective randomized trials [^notfound].

Transabdominal wall traction (TAWT) is a **dynamic closure technique** for open abdomens that applies progressive tension to the fascial edges, enabling primary fascial closure in patients with loss of domain or delayed closure. It offers higher primary closure rates, reduced need for planned ventral hernia repair, and shorter time to closure compared to static techniques, but carries risks of fascial injury, pain, and infection. Early application, careful patient selection, and standardized techniques are essential for optimal outcomes.

The final objective of this damage-control phase is closure of the abdominal cavity. The method of closure depends on whether skin approximation produces excessive intra-abdominal hypertension. Initially, towel-clip closure of the skin is preferred because it is quick and easy. When skin approximation is not possible, a temporary silo is constructed by suturing a 3-L cystoscopy irrigation bag to the skin edge with a continuous No. 2 nylon suture. Options for abdominal closure at this juncture include definitive fascial closure, skin closure alone, and prosthetic closure. The final phase is abdominal wall reconstruction in those patients in whom fascial approximation was precluded. With the use of logistic regression to control for the effect of age and injury severity, primary fascial closure was associated with an 11-fold increase in ACS. Similarly, ARDS and MOF were significantly more frequent in patients undergoing primary fascial closure. This is particularly compelling when it is assumed that primary fascial closure was reserved for patients with a more favorable situation in the operating room. Several authors have suggested that ACS and its sequelae can be avoided by leaving the abdomen open after damage-control laparotomy. 9, 10 Others have argued, however, that fascial closure is necessary to augment the tamponade effect of intra-abdominal packing and to achieve effective hemostasis. 11, 12 Moreover, the obligatory fluid losses associated with an open abdomen may be considerable. Our findings indicate that primary fascial closure is contraindicated after damage-control laparotomy to minimize the risk for ACS and its associated morbidity.

Even after controlling for the effects of age and injury severity, fascial closure was associated with an 11-fold increase in ACS compared with skin or Bogotá bag closure of the abdomen. Based on a relatively simple analysis, which did not take into account additional factors influencing the decision of abdominal wound management, the authors concluded that fascial closure should be avoided after damage-control laparotomy because it increases the likelihood of ACS and subsequent MOF/ARDS. In the multivariate analysis of the technique of abdominal closure, despite inclusion of those other variables in the model, there was an 11-fold increase in the risk of developing ACS in patients who underwent primary fascial closure.

IAH/ACS can impact any organ or present as polycompartment syndrome (PCS). Most patients need organ support, including respiratory and cardiovascular monitoring. Decompressive laparotomy decreases the IAP rapidly and significantly by increasing the intra-abdominal cavity and potentially decreasing the intra-abdominal volume by removing additional pathological volume (e.g. hematoma, ascites, abscess) and is essential for the management of medically refractory ACS. However, primary fascial closure after decompressive laparotomy is not possible in many patients with an open abdomen (OA). The goals of OA management include the use of an abdominal cover to protect the bowel from injury and contamination, continued/continuous monitoring of the IAP and prevention of IAH recurrence, fluid management (ascites and intravenous fluids), and early abdominal closure.

Different techniques for temporary abdominal closure (TAC) have been described. Wittmann patch (WP) and negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), sometimes combined with mesh-mediated fascial traction in long-term open abdomens, are the most widely used techniques. Commercially available NPWT is recommended as the preferred technique for TAC. However, OAs should be closed as early as possible and preferably within 72 h to one week, or else active consideration for a primary fascial closure at the earliest opportunity. There is a linear relationship between the risk of complications, including enterocutaneous and especially enteroatmospheric fistulae and the duration of OA. These can be especially difficult to manage and are best avoided.

Early return to the operating room, limiting fluid overload through excessive use of crystalloids, and preventing and/or treating IAH, enteric fistulae, and intra-abdominal collections are some of the recommended interventions to facilitate primary fascial closure. Finally, lateralization of the abdominal muscles (caused by adhesions between the intestine and bowel wall) should be prevented. However, the respondents commented on the variations in practices regarding OA, with a focus on fascia closure alone over both the skin and fascia. Most respondents preferred early closure, but a few suggested considerations for resolving the underlying pathology.

Future guidelines should develop a clear medical management algorithm incorporating medical and mechanical interventions to reduce intraluminal and intraabdominal volume to improve C ab and organ perfusion by introducing fluid stewardship. Medical management comes first in patients with secondary IAH/ACS, and surgical decompression can only be used as a last resort. The ideal decompression and TAC technique, as well as the best timing for opening and closing, need to be defined.

Recurrence

Fascial closure resulted in a lower risk of recurrence when compared with bridging; fascial closure 4.2 per cent (7/68) versus bridging 6.8 per cent (12/177); OR 0.60 (95 per cent c.i. 0.23 to 1.57) (Fig. 28).

Haematoma/seroma

The three RCTs did not uniformly measure seroma and haematoma separately. In one study, fascial closure resulted in a lower risk of haematoma and seroma combined when compared with bridging (fascial closure 6.1 per cent (5/82) versus bridging 13.3 per cent (12/90); OR 0.42 (95 per cent c.i. 0.30 to 1.26)). In another study, fascial closure resulted in a lower risk of haematoma when compared with bridging (fascial closure 0 per cent (0/61) versus bridging 4.8 per cent (0/61); OR 0.14 (95 per cent c.i. 0.01 to 2.73)). In two RCTs, fascial closure resulted in a lower risk of seroma when compared with bridging (10.6 per cent (9/85) versus bridging 13.8 per cent (12/85); OR 0.75 (95 per cent c.i. 0.30 to 1.84)). When the results of all three RCTs were pooled for seroma and/or haematoma, the benefit of fascial closure still failed to reach statistical significance (fascial closure 6.1 per cent (14/228) versus bridging 11.3 per cent (27/239); OR 0.52 (95 per cent c.i. 0.27 to 1.02)) (Fig. 29).

The OA is also inherently fistulogenic and fascial closure is crucial in limiting fistula formation. There is a strong relationship between reduced fistulation and successful DPC. The inability to close the abdomen and intestinal fistula are the two parameters that carry the highest mortality rates following the OA in both trauma and non‐trauma patients. It is therefore essential to plan and achieve closure as early as is practically possible. The incidence of intestinal fistulation in the OA varies depending on methods of TAC and DPC from 0% to 17.2%. In a UK‐wide survey of OA for predominately non‐trauma indications, the overall rate of intestinal fistulation was around 12%.

There are no RCTs addressing the most appropriate timing of DPC. A systematic review and meta‐analysis of 32 mostly retrospective studies (3125 patients) for all OA indications identified that early fascial closure (2.2–14.6 days) was associated with a significantly lower mortality rate (12.3% vs. 24.8%, relative risk 0.53, P < 0.0001) than delayed fascial closure (32.5–300 days) Overall complications were lower in the early fascial closure group (relative risk 0.68, P < 0.0001) and overall hospital length of stay and intensive care stays were significantly shorter but the heterogeneity of the included studies for these outcomes was very high.

When fascial closure is not possible at the first reoperation because either the fascial edges cannot be approximated or there is an ongoing requirement for the abdomen to be left open, measures need to be put in place to prevent further lateral retraction of the fascial edges. Expert consensus suggests that this should not happen at the index laparotomy as resuscitation and restoration of physiological derangements take priority. TAC with intra‐abdominal NPWT alone should be performed at the index laparotomy and on further reoperations if the patient remains unstable or there is a risk of IAH or ACS. Following fascial closure, routine measurement of IAP is recommended to monitor for the development of ACS.

Question 8.6

What is the preferred technique for delayed primary closure of the open abdomen?

Recommendation: When definitive management of the primary problem has been achieved and the abdominal fascia can be closed without tension, the abdominal fascia should be sutured closed according to best practice guidelines.

### What is the effectiveness of the negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in patients treated with open abdomen technique? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114YZYic]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The open abdomen technique may be used in critically ill patients to manage abdominal injury, reduce the septic complications, and prevent the abdominal compartment syndrome. Many different techniques have been proposed and multiple studies have been conducted, but the best method of temporary abdominal closure has not been determined yet. Recently, new randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials have been published on this topic. We aimed to perform an up-to-date systematic review on the management of open abdomen, including the most recent published randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials, to compare negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) with no NPWT and define if one technique has better outcomes than the other with regard to primary fascial closure, postoperative 30-day mortality and morbidity, enteroatmospheric fistulae, abdominal abscess, bleeding, and length of stay.

Methods

According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, an online literature research (until July 1, 2015) was performed on MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Library databases. The MeSH terms and free words used "vacuum assisted closure" "vac";, "open abdomen", "damage control surgery", and "temporary abdominal closure". No language restriction was made.

Results

The initial systematic literature search yielded 452 studies. After a careful assessment of the titles and of the full text was obtained, eight articles fulfilled inclusion criteria. We analyzed 1,225 patients, of whom 723 (59%) underwent NPWT and 502 (41%) did not undergo NPWT, and performed four subgroups: VAC versus Bogota bag technique (two studies, 106 participants), VAC versus mesh-foil laparostomy (two studies, 159 participants), VAC versus laparostomy (adhesive impermeable with midline zip) (one study, 106 participants), and NPWT versus no NPWT techniques (three studies, 854 participants) in which it is not possible to perform an analysis of the different types of treatment. Comparing the NPWT group and the group without NPWT, there was no statistically significant difference in fascial closure (63.5% vs 69.5%; odds ratio [OR], 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27–2.06; p = 0.57), postoperative 30-day overall morbidity (p = 0.19), postoperative enteroatmospheric fistulae rate (2.1% vs 5.8%; OR, 0.63; 95% CIs, 0.12–3.15; p = 0.57), in the postoperative bleeding rate (5.7% vs 14.9%; OR, 0.58; 95% CIs, 0.05–6.84; p = 0.87), and postoperative abdominal abscess rate (2.4% vs 5.6%; OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.13–1.34; p = 0.14). On the other hand, statistical significance was found between the NPWT group and the group without NPWT in the postoperative mortality rate (28.5% vs 41.4%; OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.23–0.91; p = 0.03) and in the length of stay in the intensive care unit (mean difference, -4.53; 95% CI, -5.46 to 3.60; p < 0.00001).

Conclusion

The limitations of the present analysis might be related to the lack of randomized controlled trials, so there is a risk of selection bias favoring NPWT. For several outcomes, there were few studies, confidence intervals were wide, and inconsistency was high, suggesting that although there were no statistically significant differences between the groups, there was insufficient evidence to show that the outcomes were similar. We can conclude from the current available data that NPWT seems to be associated with a trend toward better outcomes compared to the use of no NPWT. It does reflect the evidence presented in the current systematic review; however, the data should be interpreted with substantial caution given a number of weaknesses (in particular, the lack of statistical significance and heterogeneity between studies, i.e., small sample size of the included studies, high variability between studies). We highlight the need for randomized controlled trials having homogeneous inclusion criteria to assess the use of NPWT for the management of open abdomen.

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^115P7nNR]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Rapid closure with the assistance of negative pressure therapy should be the primary objective in the management of patients with open abdomen, in order to prevent severe morbidity such as fistulae, loss of domain and massive incisional hernias (Recommendation 1B).

Severe complications including loss of the abdominal domain, fistula formation, and the development of giant incisional hernias may be observed in this procedure. Following re-exploration, the goal should be the early and definitive closure of the abdomen, in order to reduce the complications associated with an open abdomen. Early definitive closure (within 4–7 days of the initial laparostomy) is the basis of preventing or reducing the risk of complications.

A systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate whether early fascial abdominal closure had advantages over delayed approach was published in 2014. The study confirmed the clinical advantages of early fascial closure compared with delayed closure in treatment of patients with open abdomen.

If unable to close the abdomen early, a progressive closure device may be necessary.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of the open abdomen and temporary abdominal closure techniques in non-trauma patients was recently published. The best results in terms of achieving delayed fascial closure and reducing the risk of entero-atmospheric fistula were shown for NPT with continuous fascial traction. Despite that the authors concluded that the overall quality of the available evidence was poor, and uniform recommendations cannot be made.

### Not so fast to skin graft: transabdominal wall traction closes most "domain loss" abdomens in the acute setting [^114Zcfck]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Damage-control laparotomy (DCL) has revolutionized the surgery of injury. However, this has led to the dilemma of the nonclosable abdomen. Subsequently, there exists a subgroup of patients who after resuscitation and diuresis, remain nonclosable. Before the adoption of our open abdomen protocol (OAP) and use of transabdominal wall traction (TAWT), these patients required skin grafting and a planned ventral hernia. We hypothesize that our OAP and TAWT device, which use full abdominal wall thickness sutures to dynamically distribute midline traction, achieve an improved method of fascial reapproximation.

Methods

From 2008 to 2011, all DCL and decompressive laparotomy patients in our urban trauma center were managed by our OAP. Thirty two were noncloseable "domain loss abdomens" after achieving physiologic steady state and near dry weight. All patients received the TAWT device when near dry weight was achieved. Wound size, days to closure, days to TAWT, and TAWT to closure were tracked.

Results

During this 36-month period, OAP/TAWT was applied to 32 patients. All patients demonstrated domain loss precluding fascial closure. Average wound size was 18.5-cm width by 30.5-cm length. Mean time DCL surgery to TAWT was 9.5 days. At time of placement, TAWT decreased initial wound width by an average of 9.8 cm (51.4%). Patients returned to the operating room for tightening/washout an average of 2.2 times (excluding TAWT insertion and final closure operations). Mean time TAWT to closure was 8.7 days. Mean time from admission surgery to primary closure was 18.2 days. All patients achieved primary fascial closure using this method without components separation or biologic bridge operations.

Conclusion

OAP/TAWT has revolutionized the way we manage "domain loss" open abdomen patients and has virtually eliminated the acceptance of planned ventral hernia. TAWT consistently recaptures lost domain, preserves the leading fascial edge, and eliminates the need for biologic bridges, components separation, or skin grafting.

### New non-invasive device to promote primary closure of the fascia and prevent loss of domain in the open abdomen: a pilot study [^111QwyJL]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this study demonstrated that a non-invasive technology applied externally on the abdominal wall promoted reapproximation of the fascia in the midline. The new device enabled continuous access to the peritoneal cavity, preserved the integrity of the fascia, and improved primary fascial closure rate compared with negative pressure therapy system only. Further investigation is necessary comparing this technology to current invasive techniques for gradual fascial reapproximation.

### The open abdomen, indications, management and definitive closure [^117Lt2Bu]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

All those involved in care of a critically ill patient should in the first instance think how to prevent IAH and ACS. In case of ACS goal directed therapy to achieve early opening and early closure is the key: paradigm of closure shifts to combination of therapies including NPWT and dynamic closure, in order to reduce complications and avoid incisional hernia.

There have been huge studies and progress in survival of critically ill trauma and septic surgical patients: this in part has been through the great work of pioneer and scientific societies, as the WSACS and their guidelines; however future studies and continued innovation are needed to better understand optimal treatment strategies and to define more clearly the indications, because OA by itself is still a morbid procedure.

Section 1

1. What is the optimal technique to close a laparotomy incision?

1.1 Continuous versus interrupted suture

The current evidence does not suggest any difference in the incidence of incisional hernia or dehiscence between continuous or interrupted sutures for fascial closure. However, the time taken for fascial closure is less with continuous closure. Therefore, we suggest a continuous suture technique of the midline abdominal wall incision in emergency settings (2A).

The literature search identified five large meta-analyses addressing the evidence on suture technique in terms of continuous versus interrupted methods. Additionally, some well-designed randomized clinical trials were considered. Guidelines from the European Hernia Society — in the original 2015 version — recommended continuous closure of the midline abdominal wall, but the updated version in 2022 also considered more recent evidence and downgraded the certainty of evidence with a weak strength of recommendation due to the inconsistency of the results. Most of the evidence related to elective surgery, and clear data in the emergency setting are lacking. Therefore, in line with the evidence from Peponis et al. randomized clinical trial, we infer that there is no significant difference between continuous or interrupted sutures in the closure of abdominal wall incision, but the continuous technique might be preferred based on the elective surgery evidence because it is faster.

1.2 Closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum

We recommend AGAINST separate closure of the peritoneum during the abdominal wall closure of emergency laparotomy (1B).

Regarding the closure of the peritoneal layer in a midline laparotomy, the Cochrane Systematic review by Gurusamy et al. concluded that there is no short-term or long-term benefit in peritoneal closure. This review included five randomized clinical trials (RCTs): inclusion criteria in the studies were heterogeneous — the type of incision, elective, or emergency setting — but the studies concluded that closure of the peritoneum is unnecessary. There is considerable uncertainty in the benefits or harms of the single-layered closure of the peritoneum as a separate layer, but this procedure is likely to increase operating time in emergency surgery.

Closure of the peritoneum involves additional operating time and suture material, and no benefit is apparent from closure of peritoneum. Therefore, it does not seem necessary after a midline laparotomy, even in an emergency setting.

### 2017 update of the WSES guidelines for emergency repair of complicated abdominal wall hernias [^117MZW1N]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Prophylactic treatment to avoid abdominal compartment syndrome involves refraining from abdominal closure when fascial approximation becomes problematic due to excessive tension ("open abdomen"). In this setting, negative pressure peritoneal therapy may play a role in mitigating the bio-mediator effects that cause distant organ failure and is an additional potential benefit of an open abdomen.

Even in cases where the abdominal wall can be closed after a laparotomy involving the discovery of diffuse contamination, fulfilling the World Society of Emergency Surgery criteria for severe complicated intra-abdominal sepsis, there is controversy as to whether the abdominal wall should be closed or left open. It is financially cheaper and would be preferable from a patient's standpoint to have a single operation and to not be submitted to longer critical care unit management if it was possible to primarily close the abdomen. However, there is a now developing biologic rationale with early clinical evidence that the open abdomen after severe complicated intra-abdominal sepsis may be preferable due to its ability to allow negative pressure peritoneal therapy which may modulate the course of systemic inflammation with progressive organ dysfunction and to provide a survival signal that needs to be confirmed in larger studies.

Following stabilization of the patient, surgeons should attempt early, definitive closure of the abdomen. Primary fascial closure may be possible only when the risk of excessive tension or recurrent IAH is minimal (grade 2C recommendation).

When early definitive fascial closure is not possible, progressive closure can be gradually attempted at every surgical wound revision. Cross-linked biological meshes may be considered as a delayed option for abdominal wall reconstruction (grade 2C recommendation).

After the patient's stabilization, the primary objective is early and definitive closure of the abdomen to minimize complications. For many patients, primary fascial closure may be possible within a few days of the first operation. In other patients, early definitive fascial closure may not be possible. In these cases, surgeons must resort to progressive closure, in which the abdomen is incrementally closed each time the patient undergoes a surgical revision. Many methods of fascial closure have been described in the medical literature.

### Closure methods for laparotomy incisions for preventing incisional hernias and other wound complications [^115Sa3mp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Surgeons who perform laparotomy have a number of decisions to make regarding abdominal closure. Material and size of potential suture types varies widely. In addition, surgeons can choose to close the incision in anatomic layers or mass ('en masse'), as well as using either a continuous or interrupted suturing technique, of which there are different styles of each. There is ongoing debate as to which suturing techniques and suture materials are best for achieving definitive wound closure while minimising the risk of short- and long-term complications.

Objectives

The objectives of this review were to identify the best available suture techniques and suture materials for closure of the fascia following laparotomy incisions, by assessing the following comparisons: absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures; mass versus layered closure; continuous versus interrupted closure techniques; monofilament versus multifilament sutures; and slow absorbable versus fast absorbable sutures. Our objective was not to determine the single best combination of suture material and techniques, but to compare the individual components of abdominal closure.

Search Methods

On 8 February 2017 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two trials registries, and Science Citation Index. There were no limitations based on language or date of publication. We searched the reference lists of all included studies to identify trials that our searches may have missed.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared suture materials or closure techniques, or both, for fascial closure of laparotomy incisions. We excluded trials that compared only types of skin closures, peritoneal closures or use of retention sutures.

Data Collection and Analysis

We abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias for each trial. We calculated a summary risk ratio (RR) for the outcomes assessed in the review, all of which were dichotomous. We used random-effects modelling, based on the heterogeneity seen throughout the studies and analyses. We completed subgroup analysis planned a priori for each outcome, excluding studies where interventions being compared differed by more than one component, making it impossible to determine which variable impacted on the outcome, or the possibility of a synergistic effect. We completed sensitivity analysis, excluding trials with at least one trait with high risk of bias. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADEpro guidelines.

Main Results

Fifty-five RCTs with a total of 19,174 participants met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Included studies were heterogeneous in the type of sutures used, methods of closure and patient population. Many of the included studies reported multiple comparisons. For our primary outcome, the proportion of participants who developed incisional hernia at one year or more of follow-up, we did not find evidence that suture absorption (absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures, RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.32, moderate-quality evidence; or slow versus fast absorbable sutures, RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.06, moderate-quality evidence), closure method (mass versus layered, RR 1.92, 95% CI 0.58 to 6.35, very low-quality evidence) or closure technique (continuous versus interrupted, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.35, moderate-quality evidence) resulted in a difference in the risk of incisional hernia. We did, however, find evidence to suggest that monofilament sutures reduced the risk of incisional hernia when compared with multifilament sutures (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.98, I² = 30%, moderate-quality evidence). For our secondary outcomes, we found that none of the interventions reduced the risk of wound infection, whether based on suture absorption (absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.17, moderate-quality evidence; or slow versus fast absorbable sutures, RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.57, moderate-quality evidence), closure method (mass versus layered, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.30, low-quality evidence) or closure technique (continuous versus interrupted, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.34, moderate-quality evidence). Similarily, none of the interventions reduced the risk of wound dehiscence whether based on suture absorption (absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures, RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.10, moderate-quality evidence; or slow versus fast absorbable sutures, RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.61, moderate-quality evidence), closure method (mass versus layered, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.52, moderate-quality evidence) or closure technique (continuous versus interrupted, RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.64, moderate-quality evidence). Absorbable sutures, compared with non-absorbable sutures (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.94, low-quality evidence) reduced the risk of sinus or fistula tract formation. None of the other comparisons showed a difference (slow versus fast absorbable sutures, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.05 to 16.05, very low-quality evidence; mass versus layered, RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.62, low-quality evidence; continuous versus interrupted, RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.61, very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Based on this moderate-quality body of evidence, monofilament sutures may reduce the risk of incisional hernia. Absorbable sutures may also reduce the risk of sinus or fistula tract formation, but this finding is based on low-quality evidence. We had serious concerns about the design or reporting of several of the 55 included trials. The comparator arms in many trials differed by more than one component, making it impossible to attribute differences between groups to any one component. In addition, the patient population included in many of the studies was very heterogeneous. Trials included both emergency and elective cases, different types of disease pathology (e.g. colon surgery, hepatobiliary surgery, etc.) or different types of incisions (e.g. midline, paramedian, subcostal). Consequently, larger, high-quality trials to further address this clinical challenge are warranted. Future studies should ensure that proper randomisation and allocation techniques are performed, wound assessors are blinded, and that the duration of follow-up is adequate. It is important that only one type of intervention is compared between groups. In addition, a homogeneous patient population would allow for a more accurate assessment of the interventions.

### Elective midline laparotomy closure: the INLINE systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Q2yjV]. Annals of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the optimal technique and material for abdominal fascia closure after midline laparotomy, first by means of a precisely defined study population and follow-up period and second by the surgically driven aspects.

Methods

Overview of existing systematic reviews and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. A systematic literature search (Medline, Embase, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) was performed to identify randomized controlled trials in elective and emergency populations comparing suture techniques (continuous vs. interrupted) and materials (rapidly vs. slowly vs. nonabsorbable). Random effects conventional and cumulative meta-analyses were calculated and presented as odds ratios and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals.

Results

Five systematic reviews and 14 trials including 7711 patients (6752 midline incisions) were analyzed. None of the systematic reviews differentiated elective versus emergency laparotomy. The analysis of available primary studies revealed significant lower hernia rates using a continuous (vs. interrupted) technique (OR: 0.59; P = 0.001) with slowly absorbable (vs. rapid-absorbable) suture material (OR: 0.65; P = 0.009) in the elective setting, which was in contrast to the conflicting results of existing systematic reviews. No statistical heterogeneity was detected in the elective setting (I = 0%). Seven studies incorporating elective and emergency procedures revealed inconclusive and heterogeneous results (I = 45%-85%). No studies have evaluated closure methods solely in the emergency setting so far.

Conclusion

No further trials should be conducted for evaluation of technique and available materials for elective midline abdominal fascial closure, according to the results of our cumulative meta-analysis. Future trials will have to define the optimal closure strategy in the emergency setting and relevance of new suture materials and other strategies such as the use of prophylactic mesh in targeted subpopulations.

Regarding preventative measures for incisional hernia, more specifically with respect to abdominal closure techniques (trocar site closure), AHS/EHS 2022 guidelines recommend to consider suturing the fascial defect for trocar sites of ≥ 10 mm, especially after single-incision laparoscopic surgery and for trocars located at the umbilical site.

### Continuous versus interrupted abdominal wall closure after emergency midline laparotomy: CONTINT: a randomized controlled trial [NCT00544583] [^1156BqLq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Although the minimally invasive approach to the abdominal cavity is becoming increasingly common, midline laparotomy is frequently applied in the emergency setting due to the high accessibility and speed. Post-laparotomy complications, especially related to the abdominal wall such as burst abdomen and incisional hernias, are prevalent.

After elective surgery, the incidence of early fascial dehiscence (burst abdomen) ranges from 0.4 to 3.5%, depending upon the type of surgery performed. Fascial dehiscence increases hospital length of stay (LOS), is associated with higher mortality and emergency surgery is frequently reported as a risk factor for its occurrence. Incisional hernias after midline incision present with a frequency of 3.0 to 20.0% even up to 64 months after the initial operation, reduce quality of life and create the risk of incarceration or strangulation with a need for emergency surgery. In emergency surgery reported rates of fascial dehiscence range from 2.4 to 23.5% and incisional hernias are reported in 11.2–22.0%.

While surgical site infection prevention and respecting anatomical structures during abdominal wall closure are widely approved concepts, various different wall closure techniques are applied. The surgical strategy of abdominal wall closure, that is, the combination of suture technique and material, is highly relevant for prevention of fascia dehiscence and is the main factor directly controllable by the surgeon.

Numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as well as meta-analyses have addressed the issue of optimal fascia closure in elective laparotomies, and after 2015 it was established that a continuous suture using the "small-bites" technique is the ideal strategy to reduce incisional hernias. However, RCTs regarding abdominal wall closure in the emergency setting are sparse and as a result of the low level of available evidence, abdominal fascia closure after emergency laparotomy is performed according to the surgeon's individual preference.

We therefore conducted an RCT to compare the two most established strategies for abdominal wall closure — continuous and interrupted — to determine an advantage of either strategy regarding the development of burst abdomen within 30 days or incisional hernia after one year.

### Updated guideline for closure of abdominal wall incisions from the European and American hernia societies [^112gtCUU]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Incisional hernia is a frequent complication of abdominal wall incision. Surgical technique is an important risk factor for the development of incisional hernia. The aim of these updated guidelines was to provide recommendations to decrease the incidence of incisional hernia.

Methods

A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL was performed on 22 January 2022. The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network instrument was used to evaluate systematic reviews and meta-analyses, RCTs, and cohort studies. The GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) was used to appraise the certainty of the evidence. The guidelines group consisted of surgical specialists, a biomedical information specialist, certified guideline methodologist, and patient representative.

Results

Thirty-nine papers were included covering seven key questions, and weak recommendations were made for all of these. Laparoscopic surgery and non-midline incisions are suggested to be preferred when safe and feasible. In laparoscopic surgery, suturing the fascial defect of trocar sites of 10 mm and larger is advised, especially after single-incision laparoscopic surgery and at the umbilicus. For closure of an elective midline laparotomy, a continuous small-bites suturing technique with a slowly absorbable suture is suggested. Prophylactic mesh augmentation after elective midline laparotomy can be considered to reduce the risk of incisional hernia; a permanent synthetic mesh in either the onlay or retromuscular position is advised.

Conclusion

These updated guidelines may help surgeons in selecting the optimal approach and location of abdominal wall incisions.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^116NMJ9f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Statement 18

Temporary abdominal closure using negative pressure therapy (NPT) can be useful to decrease the time to definitive abdominal closure (Recommendation 1 B). Prolonged NPT may increase the risk of enteric fistulae.

Following re-exploration, the goal is early and definitive closure of the abdomen, in order to reduce the complications associated with an open abdomen, such as entero-atmospheric fistulas, fascial retraction with loss of abdominal wall domain, and development of massive incisional hernias. Early definitive closure is the basis for preventing or reducing the risk of these complications and should be the goal when the patient's physiological condition allows. The literature suggests a bimodal distribution of primary closure rates. Early closure depends on post-operative intensive care management, and delayed closure depends on the choice of the temporary abdominal closure technique. The first mode is to close within 4–7 days and achieve a high rate of primary closure, the second mode has a delay (20–40 days) having lower overall closure rate. If a surgeon is unable to close the abdomen early, the use of a progressive closure device may be necessary. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the open abdomen and temporary abdominal closure techniques in non-trauma patients was recently published. The search identified 74 studies comprising 4358 patients of whom 3461 (79%) had peritonitis. The best results achieved for delayed fascial closure and reduced the risk of entero-atmospheric fistula were shown for NPT with continuous (mesh-mediated) fascial traction. However, authors stated that the overall quality of the available evidence was poor and that uniform recommendations cannot be made.

To determine whether active negative pressure peritoneal therapy (NPPT) with the ABThera temporary abdominal closure device reduces systemic inflammation after abbreviated laparotomy, a single-center, randomized controlled trial was performed by Kirkpatrick. Forty-five adults with abdominal injury (46.7%) or intra-abdominal sepsis (52.3%) were randomly allocated to the ABThera (n = 23) or Barker's vacuum pack (n = 22). The cumulative incidence of primary fascial closure at 90 days was similar between groups. However, the 90-day mortality was less in the ABThera group. Given this potential survival benefit, further well-powered multicenter trials should be conducted to confirm these provocative findings.

Level of evidence: III

Grade of recommendation: C

Consensus: 100% (SA 88.9%, A 11.1%)

Recommendation: When definitive management of the primary problem has been achieved and the abdominal fascia cannot be closed at the first return to theatre but there is likelihood of delayed primary closure, mesh‐mediated fascial traction in conjunction with negative pressure wound therapy should be employed to achieve delayed primary closure.

Level of evidence: II

Grade of recommendation: B

Consensus: 100% (SA 88.9%, A 11.1%)

Recommendation: When there is an ongoing requirement for access to the peritoneal cavity and further returns to theatre are anticipated, mesh‐mediated fascial traction in conjunction with negative pressure wound therapy should be employed to avoid fascial retraction and the abdomen should be closed once the patient is clinically stable.

Level of evidence: II

Grade of recommendation: B

Consensus: 100% (SA 88.9%, A 11.1%)

The final stage in the management of the OA is fascial closure to prevent intestinal fistulation and planned ventral hernia. Following the decision to form an OA, most patients will fall into one of three categories:
definitive management of the primary problem has been achieved and abdominal fascia can be closed;
definitive management of the primary problem has been achieved and abdominal fascia cannot be closed;
there is an ongoing problem and requirement for the abdomen to be left open.

If definitive management of the primary problem has been achieved and the abdominal fascia can be re‐approximated without tension, primary suture closure of the abdominal fascia should be performed. There is no high quality evidence to support any particular suture technique for laparotomy closure in the emergency setting but there are a small number of low quality studies which consistently report that the technique of continuous small bites with a slowly absorbable monofilament suture and a 4:1 suture to wound length ratio is safe and is not associated with an increased risk of fascial dehiscence. Current best practice for elective laparotomy closure suggests that the ideal midline laparotomy closure is a continuous suture technique using a slowly absorbable monofilament suture with a suture to wound length ratio of at least 4:1.

Regarding surgical interventions for abdominal compartment syndrome, more specifically with respect to decompressive laparotomy, WSES 2018 guidelines recommend to perform early fascial and/or abdominal definitive closure as the strategy for management of the open abdomen once any requirements for ongoing resuscitation have ceased, the source control has been definitively reached, no concern regarding intestinal viability persists, no further surgical re-exploration is needed, and there are no concerns for abdominal compartment syndrome.

### New non-invasive device to promote primary closure of the fascia and prevent loss of domain in the open abdomen: a pilot study [^111eteEM]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 25% of trauma patients undergoing emergency laparotomy are ineligible for primary fascial closure at the conclusion of the initial operation. Therefore, purposely leaving the abdominal fascia open has become a key component of damage control laparotomy. The indications to leave the abdominal wall fascia open at the conclusion of a laparotomy can be separated into three categories: anatomic, physiologic and logistic reasons. Anatomic reasons pertain to the inability to bring the fascial edges together at the index operation or creating unwarranted risks of abdominal compartment syndrome. Physiologic reasons relate to systemic dysfunction, and logistic reasons refer to anticipated surgical reinterventions in the abdomen. Leaving the abdomen open with a temporary abdominal coverage device preserves the integrity of the abdominal wall fascia and facilitates repeated abdominal explorations. Ideally, the fascia is closed through primary suture during the last phase of the staged laparotomy approach. However, there is significant variability in primary fascial closure rates reported in the literature. A systematic review and meta-analysis involving more than 3000 patients reported that the average rate of primary fascial closure was only 62%.

The method of temporary abdominal coverage used during the initial phases of the staged laparotomy approach is an important factor for successful fascial closure. Generally, primary fascial closure rates greater than 80% have been reported with vacuum-assisted devices in combination with methods that provide gradual midline dynamic tension of the abdominal wall fascia. In contrast, attempts to medialize the fascia using only vacuum-assisted devices are limited, and excessive negative pressure could potentially damage intra-abdominal viscera. Therefore, a combined approach enhances the approximation of the fascia and prevents progressive loss of abdominal domain by counteracting lateralization of the abdominal wall muscles. However, current techniques to medialize the fascial edges entail suturing prosthetic material to the fascia followed by gradual fascial reapproximation through several reoperations. Moreover, those techniques generally engage only the rectus abdominis muscle and the rectus sheath. Therefore, significant opposing force generated by the lateral components of the abdominal wall, not encompassed in the process, limits medialization of the fascial edges. Furthermore, excessive traction at the anchoring sites on the fascia frequently results in fascial damage. To tackle those limitations, we developed a novel non-invasive device for gradual reapproximation of the abdominal wall fascia and dynamic splinting of the abdominal wall muscles. We conducted a single-center pilot study to investigate the impact of the new technology on primary fascial closure in the open abdomen.

### Updated guideline for closure of abdominal wall incisions from the European and American hernia societies [^1122XMFQ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

KQ3 What is the preferred strategy for closing a laparotomy?

The literature search identified two large meta-analyses, addressing the evidence on suture materials and suture technique for the closure of laparotomies, and two systematic review and meta-analyses, of antimicrobial-coated sutures. Additionally, three RCTs of antimicrobial-coated sutures, oneof the small-bites technique, and onecomparing mass with layered closure in transverse incisions published after these systematic reviews and meta-analyses were identified.

In the original guideline, continuous closure of the midline abdominal wall was recommended based on a systematic review that included studies with rapidly absorbable multifilament sutures in an interrupted technique and slowly absorbable or non-absorbable sutures in the continuous group. In the more recent two large meta-analyses, of closure techniques, efforts were made to perform an analysis excluding trials in which the comparator arm differed by more than one component. However, many smaller and older studies of moderate to very low quality were included. A Cochrane meta-analysisincluded 11 RCTs comparing interrupted and continuous closure techniques with the same suture material: four RCTs including 1195 patients, six RCTs that looked at burst abdomen, and six RCTs on surgical-site infection (SSI) including 4933 patients. There was no difference in the rate of incisional hernia between these techniques (10.9 versus 12.7 per cent). No statistically significant difference between the groups was found for burst abdomen and SSI. Postoperative pain was not evaluated. As continuous suturing better distributes tension along the suture line, is faster and leaves less foreign body in the wound, the guidelines group advises the use of continuous over interrupted closure for elective laparotomies.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of the open abdomen and temporary abdominal closure techniques in non-trauma patients [^11595XTo]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Several challenging clinical situations in patients with peritonitis can result in an open abdomen (OA) and subsequent temporary abdominal closure (TAC). Indications and treatment choices differ among surgeons. The risk of fistula development and the possibility to achieve delayed fascial closure differ between techniques. The aim of this study was to review the literature on the OA and TAC in peritonitis patients, to analyze indications and to assess delayed fascial closure, enteroatmospheric fistula and mortality rate, overall and per TAC technique.

Methods

Electronic databases were searched for studies describing the OA in patients of whom 50% or more had peritonitis of a non-traumatic origin.

Results

The search identified 74 studies describing 78 patient series, comprising 4,358 patients of which 3,461 (79%) had peritonitis. The overall quality of the included studies was low and the indications for open abdominal management differed considerably. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) was the most frequent described TAC technique (38 of 78 series). The highest weighted fascial closure rate was found in series describing NPWT with continuous mesh or suture mediated fascial traction (6 series, 463 patients: 73.1%, 95% confidence interval 63.3–81.0%) and dynamic retention sutures (5 series, 77 patients: 73.6%, 51.1–88.1%). Weighted rates of fistula varied from 5.7% after NPWT with fascial traction (2.2–14.1%), 14.6% (12.1–17.6%) for NPWT only, and 17.2% after mesh inlay (17.2–29.5%).

Conclusion

Although the best results in terms of achieving delayed fascial closure and risk of enteroatmospheric fistula were shown for NPWT with continuous fascial traction, the overall quality of the available evidence was poor, and uniform recommendations cannot be made.

### Continuous versus interrupted abdominal wall closure after emergency midline laparotomy: CONTINT: a randomized controlled trial [NCT00544583] [^111Ss5HA]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The composite primary endpoint was the presence of burst abdomen after 30 days or incisional hernia after 12 months. Burst abdomen was defined as postoperatively missing continuity of the abdominal fascia in combination with a wound dehiscence and/or a consecutive redo surgery due to fascial dehiscence occurring up to day 30 after surgery. Incisional hernia was assessed by physical examination and abdominal ultrasound 12 months postoperatively and was defined as a fascia gap and a protruding hernia sac on ultrasound or with a clinical examination consistent with a hernia. In cases of hernia confirmed by a surgical intervention within 12 months after the index operation no ultrasound examination was mandatory.

Secondary outcome measures included length of skin and fascia incision, time needed for fascial closure, frequency of re-operation due to burst abdomen and due to any cause, frequency of abdominal re-interventions, postoperative pulmonary infection, duration of artificial respiration and postoperative hemodialysis. Furthermore, frequency of wound infection, duration of vacuum therapy and wound healing, time to first bowel movement, duration of abdominal drainage via intraoperatively placed drains and duration of closed abdominal lavage were evaluated. Finally, we assessed LOS, duration of intensive care unit stay, quality of life (by using the standardized form (SF 36)) and overall mortality.

Statistical analysis

As empirical data for the primary endpoint were not available in the planning stage, the overall rate and treatment effect regarding the primary endpoint were uncertain. Consequently, a sample size calculation was highly uncertain, and thus, the study was performed with an adaptive interim analysis. This design allowed for early stopping of the trial or, if continued, modification of design characteristics — such as recalculation of the sample size — under control of the global type I error rate. The adaptive interim analysis was planned beforehand to take place after the completion of the 12 months follow-up for 80 evaluable patients. The null hypothesis was assessed by testing the effect of the wall closure procedure in a logistic regression model that takes into account the covariates "wall closure procedure" (continuous / interrupted), BMI (values as measured on the original scale), and age (values as measured on the original scale). The global one-sided type I error rate was set atand the boundary for the one-sided p value for accepting the null-hypothesis within the interim analysis was. This approach is equivalent to two-sided testing ofand assures control of the global two-sided type I error rate of 0.05 within the chosen adaptive two-stage design.

### Managing the open abdomen: selecting an appropriate treatment strategy [^111XpzRc]. Advances in Wound Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Significance: The laparotomy is a common surgical procedure with a wide range of indications. Ideally, once the goals of surgery were achieved, the incision edges could then be approximated and the abdomen primarily closed. However, in some circumstances, it may be impossible to achieve primary closure, and instead the abdomen is intentionally left open. This review discusses the indications and objectives for the open abdomen (OA), summarizes the most common techniques for temporary abdominal closure, and illustrates treatment algorithms grounded in the current recommendations from specialty experts. Recent Advances: Still a relatively young technique, multiple strategies, and technologies have emerged to manage the OA. So too have the recommendations evolved, based on updated classifications that take wound characteristics into account. Recent studies have also brought greater clarity on recommendations for managing infection and malnutrition to support improved clinical outcomes. Critical Issues: The status of the OA can change rapidly depending on the patient's condition, the wound quality, and many other factors. Thus, there is a significant need for comprehensive treatment strategies that can be adapted to these developing circumstances. Future Directions: Treatment recommendations should be continuously updated as new technologies are introduced and old techniques fall out of use.

### Updated guideline for closure of abdominal wall incisions from the European and American hernia societies [^113rJ8dJ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for incisional hernia, more specifically with respect to abdominal closure techniques (laparotomy closure), AHS/EHS 2022 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend a specific suture material or continuous versus interrupted technique. Consider using the combination of a continuous small bites suturing technique with a slowly absorbable suture to reduce the risk of incisional hernia.

### 2013 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^116G3CrS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Advantages of the open abdomen include prevention of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). In the event of septic shock, massive fluid resuscitation, bowel edema and forced closure of a non-compliant abdominal wall all contribute to intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH). Elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) adversely affects the physiological processes of pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, splanchnic, and central nervous systems. The combination of IAH and other physiological stressors contributes to significantly elevated morbidity and mortality rates.

Several studies have investigated open abdomen in the context of intra-abdominal infections, generating great interest and optimism in the medical community.

However, in 2007 a randomized study compared open and closed "on-demand" management of severe peritonitis. The study was terminated following the inclusion of only 40 patients after acknowledging the clearly discernable clinical disadvantages of the open abdomen group (55% and 30% mortality rates for open and closed procedures, respectively). It should be noted that, in this study, the open abdomen was managed exclusively with non-absorbable polypropylene mesh and without negative pressure therapy.

Following stabilization of the patient, surgeons should attempt early, definitive closure of the abdomen. Primary fascial closure may be possible when there is minimal risk of excessive tension or recurrence of IAH (Recommendation 1C).

When early, definitive fascial closure is not possible, progressive closure should be attempted each time the patient returns for subsequent procedures.

For patients with persistent large fascial defects, it is suggested that surgeons implement bridging with biological materials (Recommendation 1C).

Following stabilization of the patient, the primary objective is early and definitive closure of the abdomen to minimize complications associated with OA.

For many patients, primary fascial closure may be possible within a few days of the initial operation.

In other patients, early definitive fascial closure may not be possible. In these cases, surgeons should attempt progressive closure, in which the abdomen is incrimentally closed each time the patient undergoes a subsequent surgery.

Many methods of fascial closure have been described in medical literature. In many cases abdominal closure is only partially achieved, resulting in large, debilitating hernias of the abdominal wall that will eventually require complex surgical repair. In these cases, bridging with biological mesh is recommended.

Results

A total of 15 KQs were formulated that were further synthesized into 13 questions due to significant overlap after analysis was performed.

The results for each of these is presented below along with 'recommendations' if there was sufficient quality of evidence or a 'good practice statement' where the quality of evidence was insufficient to make a formal recommendation. The detailed search strategies for each KQ are shown in Table S1. For each KQ a detailed Summary of Findings table, which details the number of studies analysed, the certainty assessment (including risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision), the number of patients with and without exposure, the relative and absolute effect size, and the certainty of evidence, is included in each section's Summary of Findings Table.

Key Question 1: What are the risk factors for developing an incisional hernia after previous abdominal surgery?

Good Practice Statement A: Patients should be advised that high BMI, smoking, diabetes, and immunosuppression are risk factors for developing an incisional hernia after abdominal surgery.

Good Practice Statement B: Surgeons should be aware that midline incisions have a higher risk of incisional hernia than off-midline incisions.

Good Practice Statement C: Surgeons should be aware that single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS), trocar sites 10 mm and larger, and umbilical site trocars have a higher risk of incisional hernia (trocar-site hernias).

Good Practice Statement D: Surgeons should be advised that the combination of a continuous small-bites suturing technique with a slowly absorbable suture reduces the risk of incisional hernia.

Good Practice Statement E: Surgeons should be aware that surgical site infection (SSI) after abdominal surgery is a risk factor for developing an incisional hernia and appears to have the biggest impact when compared with other risk factors.

It is important to be aware of potential modifiable risk factors so that patients can be pre-optimized where possible before elective abdominal surgery. In addition, in both emergency and elective settings, awareness of risk factors for incisional hernia may influence closure technique and the potential use of prophylactic mesh for high-risk patients.

### Temporary closure of the open abdomen: a systematic review on delayed primary fascial closure in patients with an open abdomen [^11759atL]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The open abdomen requires temporary closure. Several techniques are available for this temporary abdominal closure (TAC) (Table 1). After temporary abdominal closure, the abdominal fascia must be closed primarily. The first goal is delayed primary fascial closure; however, many surgeons do not attempt primary fascial closure at all. Often, they use mesh and/or granulation tissue with split-thickness skin grafting to close the abdominal wound. In case of persistent visceral edema, loss of domain, or lateral retraction, the only option is to close the wound with mesh or granulation tissue with split-thickness skin grafting. In doing so, they create a "planned ventral hernia", which can be corrected at a later stage.

Table 1
Overview and characteristics of the temporary abdominal closure (TAC) techniques

All patients who do not receive delayed primary fascial closure are at risk of developing a ventral hernia. These ventral hernias (whether planned or unplanned) may cause a considerable burden. Although surgical correction of a ventral hernia is possible, recovery frequently takes several months. Furthermore, reconstructive surgery, like all abdominal surgery, has a risk of mortality. The surgeon must take these burdens and risks into account when he chooses the strategy for TAC or permanent abdominal closure. However, there have been no (randomized) comparative trials on the effect of the TAC strategy on the delayed primary fascial closure rate. Furthermore, it is unknown what factors influence the delayed primary fascial closure rate.

This study was designed to systematically review the literature on temporary closure of the open abdomen to assess which TAC technique is associated with the highest delayed primary fascial closure rates.

### ECLAPTE: effective closure of LAParoTomy in emergency-2023 World Society of Emergency Surgery guidelines for the closure of laparotomy in emergency settings [^111x7QPa]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

'Retention suture technique' includes a suture outside from the primary incision site line through all layers of the abdominal wall, including the skin, with a large-bore non-absorbable suture material. Various tools are available to alleviate the tension of the retention suture on the skin for patients' comfort. The effect is to reduce the tension on the primary suture line.

In the studies which were screened by our group, the target of the trials was always patients with an emergency indication for midline incisions or elective surgery in patients with high-risk factors for wound complications. Some randomized clinical trials with moderate certainty of evidence were considered. The principal outcomes in these studies were heterogeneous, but surgical infections and wound dehiscence were typically investigated. In addition, follow-up was too short to identify any major laparotomy complications, even in oncological patients.

Anyhow, the evidence considered seems to suggest a lower incidence of wound dehiscence in the retention suture group. On the other hand, there is higher postoperative pain in the group of patients treated with retention sutures. Accordingly, retention sutures could be considered as a possible addition to suture closure of emergency laparotomy only in case of patients with very high-risk conditions for incisional hernia and wound dehiscence.

3.2 Is there any difference between using a blunt tapered needle or a sharp needle in closing the abdominal wall after an emergency laparotomy?

There are very limited data about a blunt tapered or sharp needle in closing different layers of emergency laparotomies. Therefore, no recommendations can be made, and further studies are needed to clarify this concept.

No voting was requested for this statement as there were no recommendations included in this statement.

Therefore, our group suggest the use of wound irrigation, but future evidence on the best irrigation technique is necessary.

4.3 Subcutaneous drains in emergency laparotomy incisions

There is currently no evidence supporting the routine use of subcutaneous drains. Therefore, we suggest AGAINST the routine use of subcutaneous drains after emergency laparotomy (2A).

Surgical site infection (SSI) is considered a postoperative complication after surgery that increases patient morbidity and mortality rates. Some authors suggest the use of a subcutaneous drain to prevent wound infection, but high-quality-of-evidence systematic reviews and meta-analyses demonstrate that the routine placement of a subcutaneous drain during the closure of abdominal wall incision does not confer any advantage in preventing postoperative wound infection.

Coletta et al. systematic review and meta-analysis in 2019 suggest that subcutaneous drains should not be used routinely, as it does not confer any advantage in preventing postoperative wound infection, but this does not exclude that there might be a benefit in a specific risk group of patients. We found a recent RCT of moderate level of evidence by Harish et al. which stated that subcutaneous suction drains have been shown to reduce SSIs in a large number of patients. One hundred patients were studied in this trial; however, the inconsistency in the results and publication bias means that our group cannot make a strong recommendation. It is important to obliterate any dead space by using quilting sutures.

Therefore, our group is not recommending the implementation of drains in perioperative treatment of midline laparotomy incision until evidence from future trials of low risk of bias.

4.4/4.5 Delayed Closure of the Skin (DCS) — Leaving skin open after midline laparotomy.

4.4 There is currently no evidence to support or refute delayed laparotomy closure: because of the high risk of SSIs, we suggest surgeons should consider DCS of surgical wounds compared to primary closure in case of contaminated and dirty incisions with purulent contamination (2B).

4.5 When delayed closure of surgical incision is performed, we recommend a revision between two and five days postoperatively (1B).

Surgical site infections (SSI) following abdominal surgery are common and confer significant morbidity. Therefore, there is a strong interest in reducing the rate of SSI globally.

### The role of open abdomen in non-trauma patient: WSES consensus paper [^111UgxLg]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Optimal technique for temporary abdominal closure

Negative pressure wound therapy with continuous fascial traction is suggested as the preferred technique for temporary abdominal closure (grade 1B).

Temporary abdominal closure without negative pressure wound therapy (e.g. mesh alone, Bogota bag) whenever possible should NOT be applied for the purpose of temporary abdominal closure, because of low delayed fascial closure rate and being accompanied by a significant intestinal fistula rate (grade 1B).

There is inadequate evidence to make a recommendation regarding use of negative pressure wound therapy in combination with fluid instillation in patients with temporary abdominal closure (NOT GRADED).

The perceived indications and subsequent treatment choices in managing OA differ among surgeons. The existing techniques result in different risk of entero-atmospheric fistula (EAF) and the different rate of delayed fascial closure. Overall, 74 relevant studies exist for a total of 4358 patients: 3461 (79%) with peritonitis. The described OA indications are considerably different. Thirty-eight out of 78 series described negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) TAC systems. NPWT with a dynamic component (mesh-mediated fascial traction or dynamic sutures) gives the best results in terms of delayed fascial closure, but dynamic sutures result more often in fistula. NPWT without a dynamic component (Barker's VAC or commercial products) for the use of temporary fascial closure has a moderate delayed fascial closure rate and a fistula rate similar to mesh closure without NPWT.

### International consensus conference on open abdomen in trauma [^11282dTp]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

A part of damage-control laparotomy is to leave the fascial edges and the skin open to avoid abdominal compartment syndrome and allow further explorations. This condition, known as open abdomen (OA), although effective, is associated with severe complications. Our aim was to develop evidence-based recommendations to define indications for OA, techniques for temporary abdominal closure, management of enteric fistulas, and methods of definitive wall closure.

Methods

The literature from 1990 to 2014 was systematically screened according to PRISMA [Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses] protocol. Seventy-six articles were reviewed by a panel of experts to assign grade of recommendations (GoR) and level of evidence (LoE) using the GRADE [Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation] system, and an international consensus conference was held.

Results

OA in trauma is indicated at the end of damage-control laparotomy, in the presence of visceral swelling, for a second look in vascular injuries or gross contamination, in the case of abdominal wall loss, and if medical treatment of abdominal compartment syndrome has failed (GoR B, LoE II). Negative-pressure wound therapy is the recommended temporary abdominal closure technique to drain peritoneal fluid, improve nursing, and prevent fascial retraction (GoR B, LoE I). Lack of OA closure within 8 days (GoR C, LoE II), bowel injuries, high-volume replacement, and use of polypropylene mesh over the bowel (GoR C, LoE I) are risk factors for frozen abdomen and fistula formation. Negative-pressure wound therapy allows to isolate the fistula and protect the surrounding tissues from spillage until granulation (GoR C, LoE II). Correction of fistula is performed after 6 months to 12 months. Definitive closure of OA has to be obtained early (GoR C, LoE I) with direct suture, traction devices, component separation with or without mesh. Biologic meshes are an option for wall reinforcement if bacterial contamination is present (GoR C, LoE II).

Conclusion

OA and negative-pressure techniques improve the care of trauma patients, but closure must be achieved early to avoid complications.

Summing up the evidence

While the guidelines panel analysed all available literature regarding open compared with minimally invasive surgery for midline incisional hernia of up to 10 cm in diameter during the initial search, disappointingly, there was no evidence on newer variations of laparoscopic techniques such as IPOM+ technique (which includes closure of the defect), or other more sophisticated minimally invasive operations placing mesh in the retrorectus space or eTEP. Furthermore, there are no current comparative studies of open versus laparoscopic or robot-assisted incisional hernia repair with mesh placed in the retrorectus position.

Key Question 9: Is there a benefit of primary fascial closure in midline incisional hernia mesh repair?

Recommendation A: For patients having repair of a midline incisional hernia (laparoscopic or open repair), the guidelines panel recommends that the fascial defect should be closed and bridging with a mesh should be avoided (strong recommendation, low certainty evidence).

One of the goals of incisional hernia surgery is to try to restore the abdominal wall anatomy and function. In keeping with this, closure of the fascial defect is considered an essential component of open repair and is also thought to be beneficial in laparoscopic repair. However, the effect of closure of the defect both in terms of recurrence rate and patient-reported outcomes is unclear.

Search results

The search retrieved 552 records. After the duplicates were removed, the titles and abstracts of 293 records were screened. A total of 25 reports were selected for full-text retrieval and were assessed for eligibility. A total of 20 reports were excluded. A total of five studies met the inclusion criteria. Handsearching and checking the references identified another 22 reports whose full texts were evaluated for eligibility and six studies were included. The full study selection process is presented in a PRISMA flow diagram (shown in Fig. 27). The Summary of Findings is shown in Table S9.

PRISMA flow diagram for Key Question 9

Evidence for Recommendation A

Three RCTs were identified concerning the difference in outcome for fascial closure versus bridging in laparoscopic incisional hernia repair, all published in 2020. No studies were found comparing defect closure versus bridging in open surgery. The following variables were evaluated in the meta-analysis: recurrence, haematoma, seroma, pain, and length of stay.

### Updated guideline for closure of abdominal wall incisions from the European and American hernia societies [^1136XNsJ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

The data on combined techniques consist mostly of interrupted suturing with a fast-absorbing suture material compared with continuous suturing with a slowly absorbable or non-absorbable suture material. Although systematic reviews reported a reduced rate of incisional hernia with a continuous technique with slowly absorbable or non-absorbable sutures in elective surgery, the analyses were based on studies of limited quality and several studies date from more than 30 years ago. The methodology is poorly described in these trials, with lack of informed consent, risk of selection bias, unclear randomization, insufficient duration and method of follow-up, and missing data on important confounders and secondary outcomes. Imprecision owing to few reported events is another shortcoming. Continuous suturing using the small-bites technique and a slowly absorbable monofilament suture appears to be the best practice based on low-certainty evidence. For this reason, the guideline group provided a weak recommendation.

No studies looking specifically at obese patients were found. One RCT comparing continuous and interrupted closure of emergency laparotomies was identified. This trial was assessed as being of unacceptable quality owing to insufficient follow-up (duration and 40 per cent of patients lost to follow-up) and therefore excluded. Two meta-analyses, included RCTs with midline and a variety of non-midline laparotomies. Subgroups for closure in non-midline incisions were too small. A recent trialcomparing the early results of mass and layered closure of upper abdominal transverse incisions suggested that layered closure should be preferred. However, it represents the initial results of an ongoing RCT with limited clinical value as yet. In summary, as there are no valid data available for emergency laparotomies, laparotomies in obese patients, or laparotomies performed through a non-midline incision, the principles for elective midline laparotomy closure could be applied.

### Updated guideline for closure of abdominal wall incisions from the European and American hernia societies [^116v3CXe]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for incisional hernia, more specifically with respect to abdominal closure techniques (trocar site closure), AHS/EHS 2022 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence regarding trocar site closure. Recognize that the risk of developing a trocar site hernia is increased for trocar sites of ≥ 10 mm, single-incision laparoscopic surgery trocars, and trocars placed at the umbilical site. Insufficient evidence to recommend fascial closure at the trocar site for the prevention of trocar site hernia. Insufficient evidence regarding surgical site complications and pain. Insufficient evidence to recommend optimal closure technique or material.

### Midline incisional hernia guidelines: the European hernia society [^113LU67Q]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Type of incision and closure

The type of abdominal incision is important in providing good access, especially in the emergency setting, but also in minimizing the risk of incisional hernia formation. The abdominal wall closure guidelines published in 2015 and updated in 2022 recommended transverse or paramedian incisions over midline incisions where possible to reduce the risk of incisional hernia. However, there was no mention of potential nerve damage, leading to muscle degeneration. Source data from the RCTs included in the abdominal wall closure guidelines were reassessed using GRADE methodology. A total of 12 RCTs met the quality criteria for inclusionand one additional RCTwas included that was published subsequent to the publication of the original guidelines. A total of nine studies compared transverse versus midline incisions and a total of four studies compared paramedian versus midline incisions. The overall certainty of evidence was low with significant heterogeneity both for type of incision and closure technique, and also in the method of detecting a hernia at follow-up (see risk-of-bias analysis in Fig. 5). Pooled data comparing off-midline (transverse and paramedian) versus midline incision with a median follow-up of 30 months were generated using a meta-analysis with a low certainty of evidence. The risk of an incisional hernia in the midline group was 10.0 per cent (106/1058 patients) compared with 5.2 per cent (65/1240 patients) in the off-midline group (Relative risk (RR) 0.47; 95 per cent c.i. 0.3 to 0.75); the forest plot is shown in Fig. 5.

Fig. 5
Forest plot: type of incision as a risk factor for incisional hernia

The update of the abdominal closure guidelines recommends a continuous small-bites suturing technique with a slowly absorbable suture for the closure of elective midline incisions based on three RCTs published since the 2015 guidelines. The quality of evidence was low and the strength of recommendation was weak. Nevertheless, as a significant and important part of incisional hernia prevention, the authors of these guidelines decided to include a statement on abdominal wall closure as a surgical risk factor for developing an incisional hernia. For more information regarding optimal closing techniques and mesh augmentations, the authors refer readers to the full text of the updated guidelines for closure of abdominal wall incisions from the European and American Hernia Societies.

KQ5d Is mesh augmentation beneficial during closure of emergency laparotomies?

Mesh augmentation in the context of emergency surgery is important as these patients often have impaired physiology and risk factors for fascial dehiscence and incisional hernia development. There are concerns about mesh infection, particularly in a contaminated field.

Four RCTs, have compared mesh augmentation with primary closure in emergency laparotomies. One trialof intraperitoneal implantation of a biological mesh in 48 patients was closed prematurely owing to a higher incidence of mesh-related reintervention in the prophylactic mesh group. Mesh-related abdominal wall complications included non-integration of mesh into the abdominal wall and mesh infection.

In two other RCTs, including 100 and 200 patients, abdominal wall closure was done with a 3-cm wide strip of biosynthetic mesh implanted retromuscularlyor a 4-cm wide strip of synthetic mesh implanted in the retromuscular position. The incidence of incisional hernia on imaging was higher in the suture group compared with the mesh group (22 versus 6 per cent, and 21 versus 6 per cent respectively) at 2 years' follow-up. No difference was found in 30-day morbidity between mesh augmentation and suture closure alone. Another RCTcompared the small-bites technique with or without onlay synthetic mesh augmentation. However, only 30-day results were available, which showed a decreased fascial dehiscence rate in the mesh group (0 versus 13.5 per cent). SSOs were similar in both groups, but two patients needed partial mesh explantation. No data from this trial are available on long-term incisional hernia rate.

Overall, the quality of the evidence investigating potential benefits of mesh augmentation in an emergency setting is considered very low mainly owing to insufficient small sample sizes and inconsistency because of different indications for laparotomy, different types of implanted mesh, different planes of implantation, and different methods for diagnosis of incisional hernia. More research is needed to draw definitive conclusions on potential benefits of mesh augmentation in patients undergoing emergency midline laparotomy and to identify subgroups of patients who might benefit from prophylactic mesh placement.

### ECLAPTE: effective closure of LAParoTomy in emergency-2023 World Society of Emergency Surgery guidelines for the closure of laparotomy in emergency settings [^115C7RXg]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The current evidence on the efficacy of prophylactic mesh augmentation is overwhelming. Data highlight a significant reduction in the incisional hernia rate in elective settings, and trends suggest a significantly lower rate of incisional hernia in emergency laparotomies. Prophylactic mesh augmentation after midline incision significantly impacts incisional hernia and does not predict an increased risk of postoperative complications. However, a systematic review on the use of mesh in emergency surgery included only two small RCTs. The evidence does not suggest that the wound failure is lower in the mesh group. Other observational studies are likely biased, and data must be regarded carefully, specifically about SSI rates. A large number of surgeons are still concerned about mesh reinforcement in cases of contaminated surgery.

Recent meta-analyses confirm robust evidence supporting the role of mesh as prophylactic augmentation in the closure of the abdominal wall after laparotomy: incisional hernia rate decreased significantly, but on the other hand, an increased trend in wound complications was identified. Consequently, we decided to downgrade our recommendation to a suggestion.

Anyhow, in the closure of midline laparotomy incisions in an emergency setting– specifically in the case of high-risk patients for fascial dehiscence — prophylactic mesh augmentation appears to be effective in preventing incisional hernia and safe for postoperative hospitalization.

5.2 Which type of patients should be considered for prophylactic mesh augmentation?

We suggest considering prophylactic mesh augmentation, particularly in patients with an increased risk of incisional hernia development (2B).

Risk factors for postoperative hernia development are already reported in the introduction section of this paper.

5.3 Which type of mesh, which mesh position, and which type of mesh fixation should be considered for prophylactic mesh augmentation?

In light of current evidence, for prophylactic mesh augmentation no specific type of mesh can be recommended.

### Vacuum-assisted wound closure with mesh-mediated fascial traction achieves better outcomes than vacuum-assisted wound closure alone: a comparative study [^117FXGnN]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

In 2005, Miller et al. demonstrated that prolonging the OA until the 8th to 9th postoperative day increases the probability of developing complications to nearly 25%. The primary complications described are ACS, SSI and entero-atmospheric fistula (EAF). The latter is considered the worst complication that occurred frequently in severe sepsis syndrome.

The present study confirms that OA is the gold standard technique for the application of DCS principles. The observed survival rate was 62%, which is similar to other results observed in scientific literature: Acosta et al. reported a survival rate of 70%, Carlson et al. reported a rate of 72%, and Seternes et al. reported a rate of 68%.

ACS, SAPS II, sex, pre-existing CVD and surgical technique (VAWC vs VAWCM) increased the risk of death. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the same variables were demonstrated to be statistically significant predictors for in-hospital mortality.

The reason for the use of the OA technique was ACS in 50% of cases, with a survival rate of 50%, confirming that ACS is a life-threatening condition.

Primary fascial closure was obtained in 68% of cases, and only 32% required a planned incisional hernia. Roberts et al. adopted NPWT as the gold standard procedure.

The surgical technique described above has been demonstrated to have high potential for widespread adoption when VAWCM is required. It summarises the Acosta principles regarding the performance of mesh-mediated fascial traction in order to avoid the retraction of fascial margins. It also follows the principles of abdominal wall reconstruction by the positioning of a polypropylene mesh underlay. The mesh increases the strength of the fascia in the midline, providing support for the continuous running suture for abdominal wall reconstruction and closure. No short- and long-term complications were described in the series proposed with the highest closure rate, 95 versus 5% of patients with VAWC, and with lower median days for primary fascial closure, a higher survival rate and a shorter LOS in hospital and ICU.

In addition to the results obtained by the applied indication of the OA technique and the chosen TAC strategy, several other aspects influence patient outcomes. Management of severe sepsis and septic shock requires a multidisciplinary team to assess resuscitation, respiratory support and infection control.

### Continuous versus interrupted abdominal wall closure after emergency midline laparotomy: CONTINT: a randomized controlled trial [NCT00544583] [^114ayu87]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

High-level evidence regarding the technique of abdominal wall closure for patients undergoing emergency midline laparotomy is sparse. Therefore, we conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two commonly applied abdominal wall closure strategies after primary emergency midline laparotomy.

Methods/design

CONTINT was a multi-center pragmatic open-label exploratory randomized controlled parallel trial. Two different abdominal wall closure strategies in patients undergoing primary midline laparotomy for an emergency surgical intervention with a suspected septic focus in the abdominal cavity were compared: the continuous, all-layer suture and the interrupted suture technique. The primary composite endpoint was burst abdomen within 30 days after surgery or incisional hernia within 12 months. As reliable data on this composite primary endpoint were not available for patients undergoing emergency surgery, it was planned to initially recruit 80 patients and conduct an interim analysis after these had completed the 12 months follow-up.

Results

From August 31, 2009, to June 28, 2012, 124 patients were randomized of whom 119 underwent surgery and were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) principal. The primary composite endpoint did not differ between the continuous suture (C: 27.1%) and the interrupted suture group (I: 30.0%). None of the individual components of the primary endpoint (reoperation due to burst abdomen after 30 days (C: 13.5%, I: 15.1%) and reoperation due to incisional hernia (C: 3.0%, I:11.1%)) differed between groups. Time needed for fascial closure was longer in the interrupted suture group (C: 12.8 ± 4.5 min, I: 17.4 ± 6.1 min). BMI was associated with burst abdomen during the first 30 days with an OR of 1.17 (95% CI 1.04–1.32).

Conclusion

This RCT showed no difference between continuous suture with slowly absorbable suture versus interrupted rapidly absorbable sutures after primary emergency midline laparotomy in rates of postoperative burst abdomen and incisional hernia after one year. However, the trial was stopped after the interim analysis due to futility as there was no chance to show superiority of one suture technique.

### Negative pressure wound therapy management of the "open abdomen" following trauma: a prospective study and systematic review [^114ydJRQ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Management of the open abdomen is an area of medicine which has expanded rapidly over the last 20 years and has resulted in decreased mortality rates. The benefits of managing patients with open abdomens include prevention of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), early identification of intra-abdominal complications (e.g. bowel ischemia) and ease of re-entry. Despite these benefits, maintenance of an open abdomen creates numerous management challenges such as development of fistula and infection. Prolonged maintenance of an open abdomen may also lead to a reduced chance of re-approximation of the fascia, as abdominal contents become 'fixed'. With increasing adoption of open abdomen techniques has come an increased demand for Temporary Abdominal Closure (TAC) methods to protect the Open Abdomen during the phase of open treatment. Principal techniques for TAC are: Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT), Vacuum-Pac method ("Vac" Pac), artificial burr (Whitmann™ patch), absorbable mesh/sheet, zipper, "plastic silo", skin closure and dynamic retention sutures. These techniques vary in their efficacy with regard to fascial closure rates, associated morbidity and mortality rates. A number of systematic reviews have concluded that the artificial burr and NPWT have the highest fascial closure and lowest mortality rates. Because of its relative ease of application, and preservation of fascial tissue, NPWT is becoming a dominant choice for TAC in the open abdomen patient.

### Reinforced tension-line suture after laparotomy: early results of the rein4CeTo1 randomized clinical trial [^111C4rjF]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Surgery is commonly performed for colorectal cancer. Even with minimally invasive surgery, open access for specimen extraction is needed. Incisional hernia is one of the most common complications after abdominal surgery and is a major cause of surgical morbidity. The reported incisional hernia incidence ranges between 0 and 36%. Even when strictly standardized closure techniques are used, such as in the STITCH trialthat compared large-bite with small-bite closure, the incidence was 21 and 13% respectively after 1 year.

Risk factors for incisional hernia include diabetes, overweight/obesity, smoking, immunosuppression, midline incision (versus off-midline incisions), closure technique other than the continuous small-bite technique, and surgical-site infection. Patients with colorectal cancer often have several of these risk factors and are therefore at high risk of incisional hernia, with data from Sweden indicating an incidence of 26% on CT evaluation 1 year after tumour resection. The 4: 1 small-bite technique, described and evaluated by Milbourn et al. is considered the standard for fascial closure and is the technique recommended in the European Hernia Society (EHS) guidelines. Despite use of this technique, incisional hernias still develop. Use of prophylactic mesh has been shown to decrease rates in patients at high risk, but, because colorectal cancer surgery is mostly classified as clean-contaminated, concern exists about the risk of infection and increased costs associated with mesh use.

KQ5a Is mesh augmentation beneficial for closure of elective laparotomies?

A systematic review and meta-analysisand a network meta-analysisof mesh augmentation of suture closure versus primary suture closure alone for midline laparotomies have been published. Another three systematic reviews and meta-analyseswere identified, reporting data on incisional hernia and other important outcomes, such as SSI and chronic wound pain. A further meta-analysisexamined prophylactic mesh reinforcement after suture closure versus primary suture closure in patients undergoing open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. One more recently published RCTof mesh augmentation after suture closure versus primary suture closure in patients operated for AAA was not included in any meta-analyses.

Twelve RCTs comparing outcomes of mesh augmentation with primary closure in 1815 patients who underwent midline laparotomy were collated in a meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis. Minimum follow-up was 1 year. The risk of incisional hernia was lower in patients who had mesh augmentation closure of a midline laparotomy (RR 0.35, 95 per cent c.i. 0.21 to 0.57). Similarly, a network meta-analysisof 17 RCTs with a total of 2763 patients, which compared mesh augmentation in different planes with primary closure of a midline laparotomy, showed a lower risk of incisional hernia in patients with mesh augmentation. Such a benefit of mesh augmentation was consistently reported in three other meta-analyses, oneof which included only patients with mesh augmentation in the onlay position. The inclusion criteria in most trials were morbid obesity, AAA or a predefined high-risk score for incisional hernia. Strategies employed to diagnose incisional hernia varied considerably across the studies, from clinical examination alone to cross-sectional imaging. Similarly, there was considerable variation in the indication for laparotomy, type of mesh used, and plane of mesh placement, resulting in statistical between-study heterogeneity. Although some authors explicitly reported a suture to wound length ratio of at least 4: 1 in the primary closure group, information on type of suture and technique used was limited. Furthermore, the small-bites technique was not used in the RCTs, which may have resulted in overestimation of the treatment effect. Almost half of the RCTs were judged to be at high risk of bias mainly because of selective reporting. Sensitivity analyses excluding studies that were deemed to be at high risk of bias corroborated the results of the primary meta-analysis.

### Management of the open abdomen: a systematic review with meta-analysis and practice management guideline from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma [^1179fBy3]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Multiple techniques describe the management of the open abdomen (OA) and restoration of abdominal wall integrity after damage-control laparotomy (DCL). It is unclear which operative technique provides the best method of achieving primary myofascial closure at the index hospitalization.

Methods

A writing group from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the current literature regarding OA management strategies in the adult population after DCL. The group sought to understand if fascial traction techniques or techniques to reduce visceral edema improved the outcomes in these patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology was utilized, meta-analyses were performed, and an evidence profile was generated.

Results

Nineteen studies met inclusion criteria. Overall, the use of fascial traction techniques was associated with improved primary myofascial closure during the index admission (relative risk, 0.32) and fewer hernias (relative risk, 0.11.) The use of fascial traction techniques did not increase the risk of enterocutaneous fistula formation nor mortality. Techniques to reduce visceral edema may improve the rate of closure; however, these studies were very limited and suffered significant heterogeneity.

Conclusion

We conditionally recommend the use of a fascial traction system over routine care when treating a patient with an OA after DCL. This recommendation is based on the benefit of improved primary myofascial closure without worsening mortality or enterocutaneous fistula formation. We are unable to make any recommendations regarding techniques to reduce visceral edema.

### Hernia prevention: the role of technique and prophylactic mesh to prevent incisional hernias [^116W1dkm]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Millions of laparotomies are performed annually, carrying up to a 41% risk of developing into a hernia. Incisional hernias are associated with morbidity, mortality, and costs; an estimated $9.6 billion is spent annually on repair of ventral hernias. Although repair is possible, surgeons must prevent incisional hernias from occurring. There is substantial evidence on surgical technique to reduce the risk of incisional hernia formation. This article aims to critically summarize the use of surgical technique and prophylactic mesh augmentation during fascial closure to inform decision-making and reduce incisional hernia formation.

### Negative pressure therapy is effective in abdominal incision closure [^117SGUpL]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

CDC wound classification demonstrates surgical site infection (SSI) occurs in 15%-30% of contaminated (class III) and > 30% of dirty-infected (class IV) wounds. Several techniques have been used to decrease SSI rates in midline laparotomy incisions; however, no technique has shown superiority. Evidence suggests incisional negative pressure wound therapy (INPWT) can decrease wound complications, but no literature exists regarding INPWT for high-risk laparotomy incisions. We sought to analyze the efficacy of INPWT in the management of high-risk midline laparotomy incisions.

Methods

Retrospective review of adult patients who underwent laparotomy between January 2013 and June 2014 with midline closure using INPWT. Only class III or IV wounds were included. Laparotomy incisions were loosely closed. INPWT set at 125 mm Hg is placed over oil emulsion impregnated gauze. INPWT is removed after 5 d and the wound left open to air. Records were reviewed for immediate and/or delayed surgical site complications. Primary end point was 30-d incisional SSI. Secondary end points included other surgical site complications.

Results

One class III and 12 class IV wounds were treated with INPWT for a median of 5 d. The class III wound developed a small skin dehiscence with no evidence of superficial or deep SSI. Among class IV wounds, the rate of superficial and deep incisional SSI was 25% and 0%, respectively. The overall surgical site complication rate was 41.7%.

Conclusions

INPWT in closure of high-risk midline laparotomy incisions is a safe, effective method of wound closure with equivalent SSI rates to previously described methods.

### Tissue adhesive with adjunct wound closure device… [^117RF8pf]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

1. Introduction This guidance document was developed as a special control to support the classification of the tissue adhesive with adjunct wound closure device intended for the topical approximation of skin into class II. The device is intended for topical closure of surgical incisions, including laparoscopic incisions and simple traumatic lacerations that have easily approximated skin edges. The device may be used in conjunction with, but not in place of deep dermal stitches. This guidance document does not apply to tissue adhesives for non-topical uses. This guidance document is issued in conjunction with a Federal Register notice announcing the classification of tissue adhesive with adjunct wound closure device intended for the topical approximation of skin. Section 878. 4011 Tissue adhesivewith adjunct wound closure device intended for the topical approximation of skin. Identification.

A tissue adhesive with adjunct wound closure device intended for the topical approximation of skin is a device indicated for topical application only to hold closed easily approximated skin edges of wounds from surgical incisions, including punctures from minimally invasive surgery, and simple, thoroughly cleansed, trauma-induced lacerations. It may be used in conjunction with, but not in place of, deep dermal stitches. Additionally, the adjunct wound closure device component maintains temporary skin edge alignment along the length of wound during application of the liquid adhesive. For example: "When closing facial wounds near the eye with a tissue adhesive with adjunct wound closure device intended for topical approximation of skin, position the patient so that any runoff of adhesive is away from the eye. The eye should be closed and protected with gauze.

Prophylactic placement of petroleum jelly around the eye, to act as a mechanical barrier or dam, can be effective at preventing inadvertent flow of adhesive into the eye. Use of tissue adhesive with adjunct wound closure device near the eye can inadvertently cause some patient's eyelids to be sealed shut. In some of these cases, general anesthesia and surgical intervention have been needed to open the eyelid. " Precautions We recommend that the labeling provide precautions about the inappropriate use of these devices, for example: "Tissue adhesives with adjunct wound closure device intended for the topical approximation of skin should not be used:

- in the presence of infection;
- in the presence of ongoing bleeding;
- in the presence of incomplete debridement; and
- on mucosal or hair covered surfaces. "Tissue adhesives with adjunct wound closure device intended for the topical approximation of skin should also not be used on wounds that are:

### A risk model and cost analysis of incisional hernia after elective, abdominal surgery based upon 12, 373 cases: the case for targeted prophylactic intervention [^115B95wT]. Annals of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

That question provided the framework for the current study. The literature is void of validated risk models for IH after laparotomy to inform selective, targeted use of prophylactic mesh in high-risk individuals. By informing patient selection, such a risk model represents the missing link between the goal of reducing the incidence of hernia after midline laparotomy and the demonstrated efficacy of prophylactic mesh. In addition, the risk model presented in this analysis coupled, when coupled with existing and emerging comparative effectiveness data demonstrating the benefits of PMA, will provide a foundation for the development of diagnostic and procedural billing codes for reimbursement for risk stratification and subsequent mesh augmentation. Additionally, the feasibility of this general risk model provides a future foundation for the creation of specialty- and procedure-specific IH risk models using larger databases.

The IH risk model presented herein provides an actionable preoperative tool derived from patient and operative factors. The benefit of this risk model can be appreciated by comparing 2 preoperative patient scenarios (see Supplemental Digital Content 4). A patient undergoing a low risk procedure with no patient-level risk factors has a very low risk of IH of 0.5%, whereas a comorbid patient undergoing a higher-risk abdominal surgery will have a considerable higher risk of 20.6%, representing more than a 40-fold variation. The model also demonstrates good predictive capacity and discrimination for IH, in addition to morbidity outcomes and health care resource utilization. This risk model holds promise as a useful tool to provide improved, procedure-specific, preoperative risk counseling for patients undergoing common intra-abdominal surgical procedures. An important consideration when interpreting this analysis and the findings of our study is that meticulous suture technique is critical to mitigate hernia risk. There is minimal added time and cost associated with evidence-based optimal fascial closure in which a single layer, slow-absorbing, continuous suture with a suture-to-fascial defect length of at least 4–1 using a small stitch (< 10 mm) technique. –

Analysis and presentation of data

The authors analyzed the data per technique. They calculated the delayed primary fascial closure rate by dividing the number of patients with delayed fascial closure by the total number of included patients. They pooled the percentages of delayed primary fascial closure, male patients, fistulae and abscesses, and the median age per TAC technique. The concerning percentages were weighted for study size (1/variance). For calculating the mortality rate, only the in-hospital mortality was considered.

### An international assessment of surgeon practices in abdominal wound closure and surgical site infection prevention by the European society for coloproctology [^1143a4pp]. Colorectal Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

The burden of abdominal wound failure can be profound. Recent clinical guidelines have highlighted the heterogeneity of laparotomy closure techniques. The aim of this study was to investigate current midline closure techniques and practices for prevention of surgical site infection (SSI).

Method

An online survey was distributed in 2021 among the membership of the European Society of Coloproctology and its partner societies. Surgeons were asked to provide information on how they would close the abdominal wall in three specific clinical scenarios and on SSI prevention practices.

Results

A total of 561 consultants and trainee surgeons participated in the survey, mainly from Europe (n = 375, 66.8%). Of these, 60.6% identified themselves as colorectal surgeons and 39.4% as general surgeons. The majority used polydioxanone for fascial closure, with small bite techniques predominating in clean-contaminated cases (74.5%, n = 418). No significant differences were found between consultants and trainee surgeons. For SSI prevention, more surgeons preferred the use of mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) alone over MBP and oral antibiotics combined. Most surgeons preferred 2% alcoholic chlorhexidine (68.4%) or aqueous povidone-iodine (61.1%) for skin preparation. The majority did not use triclosan-coated sutures (73.3%) or preoperative warming of the wound site (78.5%), irrespective of level of training or European/non-European practice.

Conclusion

Abdominal wound closure technique and SSI prevention strategies vary widely between surgeons. There is little evidence of a risk-stratified approach to wound closure materials or techniques, with most surgeons using the same strategy for all patient scenarios. Harmonization of practice and the limitation of outlying techniques might result in better outcomes for patients and provide a stable platform for the introduction and evaluation of further potential improvements.

### Temporary closure of the open abdomen: a systematic review on delayed primary fascial closure in patients with an open abdomen [^1136AxYP]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

At the end of most laparotomies, the abdominal fascia can be closed primarily. However, sometimes full fascial closure is not possible and the operating surgeon is forced to leave the abdomen open. The open abdomen is associated with mortality rates of > 30%.

In general, three scenarios commonly result in the commencement of an open abdomen. In patients with peritonitis, the infection causes bowel edema. During laparotomy, the expansion of the bowel may force the surgeon to leave the abdomen open. The increased intra-abdominal pressure in patients with abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) often requires a "decompressive laparotomy". In severe cases, the intra-abdominal pressure persists after the laparotomy and the surgeon must leave the abdomen open. Many trauma patients with intra-abdominal bleeding require damage control surgery. This consists of rapid assessment of the injuries and control of bleeding by direct suture/ligation or gauze packing. As part of the damage control surgery, the abdomen may be left open or the bowel edema and/or the gauze packing may simply preclude full fascial closure in these patients.

### Impact of initial temporary abdominal closure in damage control surgery: a retrospective analysis [^11213ZgE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Even with ongoing innovation, inability to re-approximate the fascial edges in the midline continues to be among the most feared complications of TAC. Failure to achieve PFC results in a large ventral hernia and loss of abdominal domain (LOD). The causes of LOD are multifactorial, but are primarily attributed to fascial retraction and increased intraabdominal pressure. PSC and BB do not prevent fascial retraction or adhesion of the bowel to the abdominal wall and have historically been associated with an increased risk of LOD and complications associated with an open abdominal wound. Vacuum-mediated closure methods have generally been regarded as superior due to their ability to drain peritoneal effluent while also providing continuous fascial traction toward the midline. As a result, many current management algorithms advocate for the use of some form of negative pressure wound therapy for initial management of the open abdomen.

The initial method for TAC may influence rates of LOD and clinical outcomes. Success with primary fascial approximation during the initial hospitalization varies widely in the literature, with rates of PFC of 29–100% reported for vacuum-assisted dressings compared to 40–75% for PSC and 12–82% for BB. Widespread acceptance of vacuum dressings, in particular commercial devices such as ABT, as the standard of care for TAC has led to cheaper and more readily available methods such as BB and PSC to be abandoned despite few comparative studies existing to appropriately guide therapy. Additionally, most available data on the subject predates the era of damage control resuscitation (DCR), which may limit visceral edema and potentially negate previous complications experienced with TAC. We sought to evaluate the role of initial TAC on eventual PFC and prevention of LOD.

1.3 Mass closure versus layered closure

For closure of abdominal midline incision in emergency surgery, no difference between mass closure or layered closure was observed in terms of incisional hernia and wound complications: we suggest mass closure because it is faster than layered closure which might be highly important when emergency surgery is performed (2B).

We used the EHS 2015 guidelines definition of 'mass closure' versus 'layered closure'.
Definitions proposed by Muysoms et al. (EHS 2015 guidelines) were:
Mass closure The midline incision is closed with a suture bite including all layers of the abdominal wall except the skin. With this approach, the suture includes the fascia layers, peritoneum (which may or may not be included), and superficial layers in a single bite. By definition, mass closure is a single-layer closure technique.
Layered closure The incision is closed with more than one separate layer of fascial closure. Specifically, if the incision is midline, there is only one layer of fascia. If the incision is paramedian, then there are two layers of rectus sheet above the arcuate line. With this approach, the peritoneal surface is normally closed separately as a different layer in the suture, and the same is done for the subcutaneous layer.

The following studies by Patel et al. and van Rooijen et al. in a systematic review and meta-analysis in 2018 analyzed the different impact of mass versus layered closure techniques in both elective and emergency settings. No difference was noted in terms of incisional hernia or wound complications, considering RCTs of moderate/low/very low certainty of evidence.

Therefore, we concluded that mass closure should be preferred because it is faster and no additional complications have been demonstrated, but the certainty of evidence is low due to the lack of specific data in emergency surgery and the low certainty of evidence from previous studies.

1.4 Suture Length-to-Wound Length ratio (SL/WL)

We recommend a suture-to-wound length ratio (SL/WL) of at least 4:1 for continuous closure of midline abdominal wall incisions in emergency surgery (1B).

### Negative pressure wound therapy for managing the open abdomen in non-trauma patients [^113vCSvZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Management of the open abdomen is a considerable burden for patients and healthcare professionals. Various temporary abdominal closure techniques have been suggested for managing the open abdomen. In recent years, negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been used in some centres for the treatment of non-trauma patients with an open abdomen; however, its effectiveness is uncertain.

Objectives

To assess the effects of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) on primary fascial closure for managing the open abdomen in non-trauma patients in any care setting.

Search Methods

In October 2021 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL EBSCO Plus. To identify additional studies, we also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses, and health technology reports. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication, or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared NPWT with any other type of temporary abdominal closure (e.g. Bogota bag, Wittmann patch) in non-trauma patients with open abdomen in any care setting. We also included RCTs that compared different types of NPWT systems for managing the open abdomen in non-trauma patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed the study selection process, risk of bias assessment, data extraction, and GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included two studies, involving 74 adults with open abdomen associated with various conditions, predominantly severe peritonitis (N = 55). The mean age of the participants was 52.8 years; the mean proportion of women was 39.2%. Both RCTs were carried out in single centres and were at high risk of bias. Negative pressure wound therapy versus Bogota bag We included one study (40 participants) comparing NPWT with Bogota bag. We are uncertain whether NPWT reduces time to primary fascial closure of the abdomen (NPWT: 16.9 days versus Bogota bag: 20.5 days (mean difference (MD) -3.60 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.16 to 0.96); very low-certainty evidence) or adverse events (fistulae formation, NPWT: 10% versus Bogota: 5% (risk ratio (RR) 2.00, 95% CI 0.20 to 20.33); very low-certainty evidence) compared with the Bogota bag. We are also uncertain whether NPWT reduces all-cause mortality (NPWT: 25% versus Bogota bag: 35% (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.88); very low-certainty evidence) or length of hospital stay compared with the Bogota bag (NPWT mean: 28.5 days versus Bogota bag mean: 27.4 days (MD 1.10 days, 95% CI -13.39 to 15.59); very low-certainty evidence). The study did not report the proportion of participants with successful primary fascial closure of the abdomen, participant health-related quality of life, reoperation rate, wound infection, or pain. Negative pressure wound therapy versus any other type of temporary abdominal closure There were no randomised controlled trials comparing NPWT with any other type of temporary abdominal closure. Comparison of different negative pressure wound therapy devices We included one study (34 participants) comparing different types of NPWT systems (Suprasorb CNP system versus ABThera system). We are uncertain whether the Suprasorb CNP system increases the proportion of participants with successful primary fascial closure of the abdomen compared with the ABThera system (Suprasorb CNP system: 88.2% versus ABThera system: 70.6% (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.14); very low-certainty evidence). We are also uncertain whether the Suprasorb CNP system reduces adverse events (fistulae formation, Suprasorb CNP system: 0% versus ABThera system: 23.5% (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.92); very low-certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (Suprasorb CNP system: 5.9% versus ABThera system: 17.6% (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 2.89); very low-certainty evidence), or reoperation rate compared with the ABThera system (Suprasorb CNP system: 100% versus ABThera system: 100% (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.12); very low-certainty evidence). The study did not report the time to primary fascial closure of the abdomen, participant health-related quality of life, length of hospital stay, wound infection, or pain.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the available trial data, we are uncertain whether NPWT has any benefit in primary fascial closure of the abdomen, adverse events (fistulae formation), all-cause mortality, or length of hospital stay compared with the Bogota bag. We are also uncertain whether the Suprasorb CNP system has any benefit in primary fascial closure of the abdomen, adverse events, all-cause mortality, or reoperation rate compared with the ABThera system. Further research evaluating these outcomes as well as participant health-related quality of life, wound infection, and pain outcomes is required. We will update this review when data from the large studies that are currently ongoing are available.

### Midline incisional hernia guidelines: the European hernia society [^116tPcEV]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Evidence for Good Practice Statements C and D

Disappointingly, there was a lack of reliable data in the literature on the most important outcome measures for patients undergoing treatment for incisional hernias. It has recently been recognized that there is an unacceptable heterogeneity in reporting outcomes used in the hernia literature and efforts have been made to create a core outcome data set. Due to the absence of data in the literature analysed, evidence for Good Practice Statements C and D were generated using expert evidence.

Key Question 5: (a) What are the important modifiable risk factors that should be optimized before surgery? and (b) What is the effect of pre-optimization?

Good Practice Statement A: For patients undergoing treatment for an incisional hernia, the important modifiable risk factors are high BMI, poorly controlled diabetes, and smoking.

Good Practice Statement B: For patients undergoing treatment for an incisional hernia, the guidelines panel recommends patient pre-optimization before surgery. This includes targeted weight loss (if high BMI), good diabetic control (measured by HbA1c), smoking cessation, and improved pulmonary fitness.

Good Practice Statement C: For patients with a symptomatic incisional hernia who are unable to lose weight after a dedicated weight loss programme over a pre-optimization interval and where surgery is technically possible, the guidelines panel suggests that the increased risks of delaying surgery (worsening quality of life and enlarging fascial defect) may outweigh the benefits of further weight loss, but this needs careful discussion of the risks and benefits with the patient.

The majority of patients with an incisional hernia are managed in the elective setting without a time-critical need for surgery. This enables thorough preoperative planning and physiological optimization of the patient to minimize the risk of wound complications and increase the chance of success from surgery. Although the overall evidence on the effects of pre-optimization is limited in incisional hernia patients, there is consensus among experts regarding the role of preoperative assessment and optimization of patients with obesity, with diabetes, who smoke, and with poor nutritional and/or physical status.

### Early placement of a non-invasive, pressure-regulated, fascial reapproximation device improves reduction of the fascial gap in open abdomens: a retrospective cohort study [^1143oiwq]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Early application of the AbClo device, ≤ 24 hours after the initial laparotomy, was associated with a significantly greater reduction of the abdominal wall fascial gap in the OA. Moreover, early application of the device resulted in a primary myofascial closure rate of 98% (online supplemental file 1). Our findings suggest that a non-invasive, pre-emptive approach to fascial reapproximation could have a positive impact in preventing lateralization and contraction of the abdominal wall in OA patients. New research is needed to explore potential long-term effects of early AbClo placement compared with other methods.

### Continuous versus interrupted abdominal wall closure after emergency midline laparotomy: CONTINT: a randomized controlled trial [NCT00544583] [^115GY8A9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

CONTINT is the first multicenter RCT comparing continuous and interrupted abdominal wall closure with the composite primary endpoint incidence of incisional hernia and burst abdomen after emergency midline laparotomy. No significant difference between continuous and interrupted closure was found regarding the primary endpoint and any other postoperative complications. Length of hospital, length of intensive care unit stay and quality of life 1 and 12 months after surgery were comparable between groups. However, time needed for abdominal wall closure was significantly longer in the interrupted suture group than in the continuous group.

The rate of incisional hernia or burst abdomen in our trial is considerably higher than the rates reported in elective surgery trials. Previously reported difference in favor of interrupted closure was not corroborated by our findings. The INLINE systematic review and meta-analysis which compared both elective and emergency surgery patients had shown a 11.3% incisional hernia incidence for the continuous closure and 7.9% for interrupted whereas we found a 27.1% and 30% occurrence of the composite endpoint, respectively. Although the studies included in this systematic review had similar length of follow-up (12 months), they did not apply the same rigorous criteria as CONTINT with clinical and ultrasound examination as part of the evaluation. A short follow-up period in previous trials is another reasonable explanation for this discrepancy as shown in the publication of the 3-year follow-up of the INSECT trial participants, in which the rate of incisional hernia increased from 12.3% after 1 year to 23.2% after 3 years.

An analogous US trial comparing slowly absorbable interrupted polydioxanone sutures to a continuous suture in the emergency setting showed far lower rate of early fascial dehiscence (not reporting reoperations due to burst abdomen), but similar rates of incisional hernias after 1 year (13.5% for interrupted and 22.0% for continuous). Such high rates remain commonplace after emergency midline incisions, contrary to the findings of large RCTs in elective surgeries (e.g. 12.6% in the INSECT and 21% in the STITCH trial). The 6.6% rate of reoperation due to burst abdomen in our ITT dataset is in accordance with contemporary data not using the small-bites technique which was recommended by the EHS in 2015. In a single-center one-arm trial compared to historical data a reduction was seen in postoperative fascial dehiscence from 6.6% to 3.8% after converting the institutional standard to this technique.

Preclosure glove change

Statement 6: Preclosure glove changes may be useful in reducing SSI risk when compared with no glove changes.

Glove changes are an important consideration because micro-perforations can occur with increasing duration of wear during surgical procedures. Moreover, gloves may become contaminated once the bowel is opened. Evidence has shown that changing gloves reduces the degree of bacterial contamination.

The direct impact of surgical glove changes on SSI has not been independently studied. The best evidence in CRS comes from the same meta-analysis which concluded that care bundles, which included preclosure glove changes, were associated with an SSI reduction compared with bundles without preclosure glove changes (56.9% vs. 28.5%; p = 0.002). However, other bundle components were not controlled for. Guidelines by ACS and SIS and the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) recommend preclosure glove changes to reduce SSI risk.

Small bites compared with large bites in musculo-fascial closure

Statement 7: There is insufficient evidence that a small bite suture technique reduces SSI risk compared with a large bite suture technique. However, the small bite suture technique is associated with reduced incisional hernia risk.

Small bite suturing involves approximately 5-mm tissue bites being placed 5 mm apart, whereas large bite suturing incorporates 10-mm tissue bites 10 mm apart. Evidence from a small meta-analysis of RCTs in elective laparotomies found no difference in SSI between the two techniques (OR = 0.67; 95% CI 0.39–1.15) but a significantly lower risk of incisional hernia was found following the use of small bites (OR = 0.41; 95% CI 0.19–0.86). Recent evidence from an observational study has reported fewer SSIs after a small bite technique for abdominal wound closure of midline laparotomy (17% vs. 28%; p = 0.02).

Results from this evidence are difficult to interpret as wound outcome definitions may be heterogeneous across studies. However, the benefits of small bites to reduce overall complications, such as incisional hernia, may impact the rate of SSI. Future studies on suture bite technique are warranted.

### The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland consensus guidelines in emergency colorectal surgery [^111ggMbZ]. Colorectal Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

The expert consensus panel was in agreement that the technique for re‐suturing the fascia should aim to distribute tension as much as possible; therefore, using a greater than 4:1 wound to suture length ratio and small bites is the most appropriate way to achieve this, which is also in accordance with other guidelines

Permanent synthetic mesh for repair of dehiscence should be avoided as wounds are often contaminated and there is a high incidence of postoperative complications including mesh infection (77%) without any significant reduction in the prevention of incisional hernia. If the fascia cannot be approximated due to tension or damage to the fascial edges, then intraperitoneal placement of a polyglactin 910 mesh and closure of the skin and subcutaneous fat over it is entirely reasonable but will lead to a planned ventral hernia.

The use of TAC in the BA is not well evaluated; however, if re‐suturing of the fascia cannot be achieved due to adhesions, tension or intra‐abdominal infection being present, the viscera need to be protected and treated as for an OA to prevent the development of EAF. NPWT can be safely extended to the BA. NPWT as a static technique has been described in the BA in a small number of retrospective series. NPWT‐MMFT as a dynamic technique to achieve fascial closure has also been described but the small patient numbers, retrospective studies with disease and patient heterogeneity do not allow any recommendation to be made.

Due to the critical condition of potential study participants and the heterogeneity of their clinical presentation, high quality randomized clinical trials in this field are uncommon. We anticipate further useful data from current trials recruiting patients.

### Management of the open abdomen [^113zUTnc]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

The open abdomen has become the standard of care in damage-control procedures, the management of intra-abdominal hypertension, and in severe intra-abdominal sepsis. This approach has saved many lives but has also created new problems, such as severe fluid and protein loss, nutritional problems, enteroatmospheric fistulas, fascial retraction with loss of abdominal domain, and development of massive incisional hernias. Early definitive closure is the basis of preventing or reducing the risk of these complications. The introduction of new techniques and materials for temporary and subsequent definitive abdominal closure has improved outcomes in this group of patients.

Title and abstract screening of the complete body of evidence from the literature searches was performed by six guideline group members and the evidence summarized for each KQ. Members of the guideline group were divided into six subgroups that evaluated the selected full-text papers on specific KQs. To avoid any conflict of interest, care was taken to ensure that subgroup members did not assess papers that they authored or co-authored. Records were screened by title and abstract by at least two assessors. Full texts were evaluated by at least two assessors independently. Only papers rated as being of acceptable or high quality according to the SIGN checklistwere included, to limit the risk of bias. Any disagreement between assessors was settled by discussion either in the entire group or by a third assessor. References of all papers included in full-text assessment were cross-checked for studies not identified by the literature search. Data from acceptable or high-quality articles were tabulated in summary-of-evidence tables.

The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to appraise the papers with respect to the five domains of certainty (risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias) and to generate evidence tables. Evidence for each KQ was then rated according to the GRADE scale, ranging from very low (X000) to high (XXXX)(Table S2). The subgroup proposed the recommendations to the whole guidelines group within an evidence-to-decision framework. Based on the evidence from the literature, clinical experience of the members and patient values, the group reached consensus on recommendations for each KQ when 75 per cent or more of the members agreed. Recommendations were classified as strong or weak in line with GRADE methodology. If there was no evidence for a KQ, or it was of inadequate quality, no recommendation was made. All subgroup members wrote the text of their research question, and these were combined and edited by the first author. Language and style editing was undertaken by a native speaker. The steering group critically revised the manuscript, and the full manuscript was sent to all co-authors for review. Before submission, the manuscript was appraised by five experts, including a methodological expert, and evaluated using the AGREE II instrument. The AGREE II instrument assesses the methodological rigour and transparency in which a guideline is developed. The tool is used to calculate a quality score for six domains. The guideline was adjusted according points raised by the AGREE appraisers.

Returning to the operating room

In principle, following 24 to 48 h after the initial surgery the patient should be taken back to the operating room for re-operation. Re-operation should be performed within 24–48 h after the initial surgery because exploration of peritoneal cavity with lavage, drainage and source control is feasible. The abdominal exploration may be more difficult later due to the intraperitoneal adhesions and risks enteric injury.

Fascial closure

Following re-exploration, the goal is early and definitive closure of the abdomen, in order to reduce the complications associated with an open abdomen, such as enteroatmospheric fistulas, fascial retraction with loss of abdominal wall domain, and development of massive incisional hernias.

Early definitive closure is the basis of preventing or reducing the risk of these complications.

The literature suggests a bimodal distribution of primary closure rates, with early closure depending on post-operative intensive care management and delayed closure depending on the choice of the temporary abdominal closure technique.

A systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate whether early fascial abdominal closure had advantages over delayed approach was published in 2014. Mortality, complications, and length of stay were compared between early and delayed fascial closure. In total, 3125 patients were included for the final analysis, and 1942 (62%) patients successfully achieved early fascial closure. Compared with delayed abdominal closure, early fascial closure was associated with reduced mortality (12.3% versus 24.8%, RR, 0.53, P < 0.0001) and complication rate (RR, 0.68, P < 0.0001). The study confirmed the clinical advantages of early fascial closure compared with delayed closure in treatment of patients with open abdomen.

- no concerns regarding intestinal viability persist

- no further surgical re-exploration is needed

### Triple-step laparoscopic incisional hernia repair: midline suture closure supported by dorsal component separation and intraperitoneal onlay mesh reinforcement [^113SuXDk]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We propose a new, simple laparoscopic triple-step technique that meets the requirements of incisional hernia repair concerning abdominal wall reinforcement and tension-free repair. The midline closure is established using a strong PDS sling suture regularly applied during open surgery together with dorsal component separation that consists of transversus abdominis fascia release. Final IPOM reinforcement ensures the strength of the hernia repair. Our technique also follows the recommendations for abdominal fascial closure in terms of the stitch length and the suture length/wound length ratio of at least 4. We find the procedure to be safe and reliable without relevant additional morbidity risk for the patient. We believe that the procedure can become a valuable asset to the surgical armamentarium in the treatment of incisional hernias by combining the benefits of laparoscopic and open hernia repair.

### Surgical strategies for management of the open abdomen [^1118aP6g]. World Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Since the mid-1990s the surgical community has seen a surge in the prevalence of open abdomens (OAs) reported in the surgical literature and in clinical practice. The OA has proven to be effective in decreasing mortality and immediate postoperative complications; however, it may come at the cost of delayed morbidity and the need for further surgical procedures. Indications for leaving the abdomen open have broadened to include damage control surgery, abdominal compartment syndrome, and abdominal sepsis. The surgical options for management of the OA are now more diverse and sophisticated, but there is a lack of prospective randomized controlled trials demonstrating the superiority of any particular method. Additionally, critical care strategies for optimization of the patient with an OA are still being developed. Review of the literature suggests a bimodal distribution of primary closure rates, with early closure dependent on postoperative intensive care management and delayed closure more affected by the choice of the temporary abdominal closure technique. Invariably, a small fraction of patients requiring OA management fail to have primary fascial closure and require some form of biologic fascial bridge with delayed ventral hernia repair in the future.

### Anatomical, physiological, and logistical indications for the open abdomen: a proposal for a new classification system [^113JSB3o]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

We found that patients with a logistical reason were most likely to have primary fascial closure compared to those without a logistical reason. Logistical determinants are frequently based upon a deliberate decision to return to the operating room rather than the status of the abdominal wall or the patient's clinical condition. In logistical reasons, fascial closure is usually possible and would be physiologically tolerated but the decision is made not to close the abdomen. Several studies have demonstrated that patients who require fewer re-laparotomies, and who have shorter duration of open abdomen management have higher rates of primary fascial closure. Earlier closure has also been associated with improved post-operative outcomes. In our series, logistical reasons, as expected, were associated with significantly higher rates of the bowel left in discontinuity and packing compared to the absence of that reason. In both of these clinical scenarios, a high rate of successful primary fascial closure would be expected at the first re-laparotomy. The greater potential for obtaining early primary fascial closure is a defining characteristic of patients with logistical reasons and likely contributes to the high rate of fascial closure observed in this cohort.

Abdominal wall closure

Peritoneum closure

Non-closure of parietal peritoneum only, compared with closure of both layers, probably reduces postoperative pain, and time to mobilization and to oral intake (Table 6). Non-closure of visceral peritoneum only, compared with closure of both layers, reduces urinary frequency, urgency of urination and stress incontinence, and may reduce operating time, and postoperative hospital stay. Non-closure versus closure of both layers probably reduces operating time, chronic pelvic pain, and postoperative hospital stay, but it does not affect the risk of wound infection or need for additional analgesia after 24–48 h. For all other comparisons and outcomes in Table 6, the evidence is insufficient or uncertain.

Closure of other layers

There are no SRs assessing benefits and harms of fascia and rectus muscle closure or approximation (Table 7). Closure, compared with non-closure, of subcutaneous tissue reduces seroma formation and wound complications.

Skin closure

For subcuticular suture, PGA absorbable suture, compared with interrupted nylon suture, may increase the risk of forming a hypertrophic scar and monofilament suture, compared with multifilament suture, may reduce surgical site infection (Table 7). Skin closure using absorbable sutures, compared with non-absorbable metal staples, probably reduces the risk of wound separation. The use of staples, compared with absorbable subcuticular sutures, probably has no effect on the length of the maternal stay but probably increases the risk of skin separation. The use of clips, compared to sutures, probably decreases skin closure time but probably increases the risk of wound separation. For all other comparisons and outcomes in Tables 6 and 7, the evidence is insufficient or uncertain.

Wound drain and dressing

Using versus not using a wound drain does not affect need for postoperative analgesia or breastfeeding at hospital discharge (Table 8). The use of a subcutaneous, compared to a sub-sheath, drain may increase the risk of wound infection. The use of advanced DACC-impregnated dressing, compared with simple dressing, may reduce SSI. Negative pressure wound therapy, compared with standard dressing, reduces SSI and probably reduces superficial SSI, but has no effect on the risk of dehiscence or deep SSI, and may increase skin blisters. For all other comparisons and outcomes in Table 8, the evidence is insufficient or uncertain.

### Updated guideline for closure of abdominal wall incisions from the European and American hernia societies [^115Rm8Kr]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Incisional hernias are frequent complications of abdominal wall incisions. A meta-analysisincluding over 14 000 patients reported a weighted incidence of 12.8 per cent 2 years after a midline incision, and that one-third of patients with an incisional hernia undergo surgical repair. Recurrence rates after repair of incisional hernia range between 23 and 50 per cent, with increasing rates of complications and re-recurrence after each subsequent failed repair. A reduction in incidence of incisional hernia by 5 per cent was calculated to result in a cost saving of €4 million per year in France. Prevention of incisional hernia is therefore important.

Patient factors contribute to the risk of developing an incisional hernia, including obesity, age, smoking, aneurysmal disease, and wound infections. Location of the incision, suture material used, and closure technique are also well known risk factors. In 2015, the European Hernia Society (EHS)published guidelines on closure of abdominal wall incisions. Since then, several knowledge gaps, as identified by the guidelines committee, have been addressed in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. This warranted an update of the EHS guidelines, which was performed in collaboration with the American Hernia Society (AHS).

The objective of this paper was to provide an up-to-date guideline on abdominal wall incisions in adults with the aim of reducing the incidence of incisional hernia. Secondary objectives were to provide recommendations on the prevention of burst abdomen, surgical-site occurrences (SSOs, including wound infection, wound necrosis, wound dehiscence, haematoma, and seroma), and postoperative pain, and improvement in abdominal wall function and cosmesis in patients undergoing abdominal surgery.

### Small bites versus large bites for closure of abdominal midline incisions (STITCH): a double-blind, multicentre, randomised controlled trial [^113tEVy7]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Incisional hernia is a frequent complication of midline laparotomy and is associated with high morbidity, decreased quality of life, and high costs. We aimed to compare the large bites suture technique with the small bites technique for fascial closure of midline laparotomy incisions.

Methods

We did this prospective, multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial at surgical and gynaecological departments in ten hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients aged 18 years or older who were scheduled to undergo elective abdominal surgery with midline laparotomy were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated randomisation sequence, to receive small tissue bites of 5 mm every 5 mm or large bites of 1 cm every 1 cm. Randomisation was stratified by centre and between surgeons and residents with a minimisation procedure to ensure balanced allocation. Patients and study investigators were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was the occurrence of incisional hernia; we postulated a reduced incidence in the small bites group. We analysed patients by intention to treat. This trial is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT01132209 and with the Nederlands Trial Register, number NTR2052.

Findings

Between Oct 20, 2009, and March 12, 2012, we randomly assigned 560 patients to the large bites group (n = 284) or the small bites group (n = 276). Follow-up ended on Aug 30, 2013; 545 (97%) patients completed follow-up and were included in the primary outcome analysis. Patients in the small bites group had fascial closures sutured with more stitches than those in the large bites group (mean number of stitches 45 [SD 12] vs 25 [10]; p < 0.0001), a higher ratio of suture length to wound length (5.0 [1.5] vs 4.3 [1.4]; p < 0.0001) and a longer closure time (14 [6] vs 10 [4] min; p < 0.0001). At 1 year follow-up, 57 (21%) of 277 patients in the large bites group and 35 (13%) of 268 patients in the small bites group had incisional hernia (p = 0.0220, covariate adjusted odds ratio 0.52, 95% CI 0.31–0.87; p = 0.0131). Rates of adverse events did not differ significantly between groups.

Interpretation

Our findings show that the small bites suture technique is more effective than the traditional large bites technique for prevention of incisional hernia in midline incisions and is not associated with a higher rate of adverse events. The small bites technique should become the standard closure technique for midline incisions.

### Early placement of a non-invasive, pressure-regulated, fascial reapproximation device improves reduction of the fascial gap in open abdomens: a retrospective cohort study [^1117CP2k]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intentionally leaving the abdominal fascia open at the end of a laparotomy entails significant complications in both trauma and emergency general surgery (EGS). Timely primary fascial closure and fewer takebacks are conceivably the most effective approach to reduce the complications related to open abdomens (OA). However, loss of the midline attachment of the abdominal wall fascia results in muscle unloading and time-dependent muscle contracture hindering myofascial closure in OA. Higher rates of fascial closure have been achieved when temporary abdominal coverage methods are used in conjunction with fascial traction systems, in particular, continuous traction with retention sutures and synthetic polymer sheets, mesh-mediated traction, and elastomers transpierced through the abdominal wall. Although those technologies provide gradual traction of the fascia, they require invasive surgical procedures under general anesthesia, and may cause fascial damage, adding to the complications of the OA. Therefore, they are infrequently used early in the management of the OA engendering lateral retraction of the abdominal wall and increase of the fascial gap. A recently developed non-invasive, pressure-mediated device (AbClo, InventoRR MD Inc. Markham, ON, Canada) has been used to mitigate lateral retraction of the abdominal wall fascia and provide gradual myofascial medialization to facilitate ultimate primary fascial closure of the OA. The biomechanical principle of the device is based on non-invasive propagation of force vectors from the skin to deeper myofascial layers.

The primary objective of this study was to compare time-related reduction of the width of the fascial gap in response to the early placement (≤ 24 hours after the initial laparotomy) versus late placement (> 24 hours after laparotomy) of the AbClo device in OA patients for trauma and EGS. The study also aimed to assess the overall effectiveness of the device in facilitating myofascial closure.

### Safety and efficacy of prophylactic onlay resorbable synthetic mesh with a comprehensive wound bundle at laparotomy closure in high-risk emergency abdominal surgery: an observational study [^1151DVYo]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Emergency general surgery (EGS) accounts for up to 50% of the modern general surgeon's workload. Emergency laparotomy is the highest-risk procedure we perform, with mortality rates approaching 15% internationally. As outcomes improve through initiatives such as EGS registries, we need to focus not only on mortality but also on morbidity.

Paradigm shifts in fascial and wound closure have been facilitated by randomised control trials (RCTs) of fascial closure techniques, such as small bite and prophylactic mesh placement, which have shown significant reductions in IH rates. Similarly, reductions in burst abdomen, seroma formation and surgical site infections (SSI) are possible through the implementation of wound bundles. The uptake of these new approaches has been slow in clinical practice. Prophylactic mesh fascial augmentation has failed to gain wide acceptance with only 3% of surgeons in the UK currently using PMA. This is due in part to a fear of adverse effects, perceived increased infection risk, potential chronic pain, mesh extrusion and risk of enterocutaneous fistula. In addition to potentially preventing IHs, which can develop in about 22% of emergency laparotomies, fascial dehiscence (burst abdomen), which occurs in 0.2–5% of elective and 3.8–45% of emergency abdominal surgery, is also reduced with mesh-reinforced fascial closure. With greater experience in mesh placement and novel forms of synthetic long-acting resorbable meshes, new opportunities have arisen. The merits of using prophylactic mesh are highlighted in many scientific papers; however, there is limited data looking at their application in the emergency setting. Resorbable mesh has the theoretical advantage of facilitating subsequent abdominal surgery as it has resorbed by 18 months. The European and American Hernia Societies as well as the World Society of Emergency Surgery guidelines for laparotomy closure highlight the evidence for PMA and recommend considering it at elective abdominal closure, however, they recognise that a knowledge gap exists in its use in emergency settings and fail to reach a consensus recommendation here. Emergency surgery can carry an increased risk of post-operative complications when compared with elective surgery, in part due to the inability to optimise patient risk factors before surgery, such as through weight reduction or achieving properly controlled comorbidities, as well as the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis in 30–50% of those who undergo emergency laparotomies. Meta-analyses, though limited, have similarly demonstrated a reduction in IH and fascial dehiscence, although with increased SSI rates in emergency surgery.

### Delayed closure of open abdomen in septic patients is facilitated by combined negative pressure wound therapy and dynamic fascial suture [^114Mqnvb]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The aim of this prospective controlled trial was the definition of the optimal timepoint for delayed closure after negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in the treatment of the open abdomen (OA) in septic patients after abdominal surgery. The delayed closure of the abdominal wall after abdominal NPWT treatment is often problematic due to the lateralization of the fascial edge leading to unfavorably high tensile forces of the adapting sutures in the midline. We present the results of an innovative combination of NPWT with a new fascial-approximation technique using dynamic fascial sutures (DFS) and delayed closure of the abdominal wall.

Methods

Eighty-seven patients subjected to OA therapy following surgery for secondary peritonitis were treated with NPWT and DFS. In all patients, a running suture of elastic vessel loops was used to approximate fascial edges. This procedure was continued for the duration of NPWT until final closure of the abdomen with running suture in 55 patients (63.2%) and interrupted suture technique in eight patients (9.2%). An anterior component separation was performed in seven patients.

Results

Delayed closure was achieved in 68 patients (78.2%) after 12.6 days [mean (SD) 25.1 (2–204)] days and 4.3 re-operations [mean (SD) 6.0 (1–43)]. Fifteen (17.2%) superficial and two (2.3%) deep wound infections occurred. In three (3.4%) cases, entero-atmospheric fistulas had to be treated. We recorded no technique-specific complications. Four (5.9%) incisional hernia were detected in a mean follow-up of 40.5 months (16–65). Mortality rate was 55.2%.

Conclusion

Using a new technique combining NPWT and DFS in the treatment of the OA, the delayed closure of the fascial edges by running suture can be achieved and the number of re-operations can be kept low. The technique was safe and led to a low incidence of incisional hernias. Extensive abdominal wall reconstruction was seldom required.

### Outcome of negative-pressure wound therapy for open abdomen treatment after nontraumatic lower gastrointestinal surgery: analysis of factors affecting delayed fascial closure in 101 patients [^114aMcdJ]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Few studies have focused on the risk factors for failure to achieve fascial closure after use of negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in an open abdomen (OA). We aimed at analyzing possible risk factors for failure of fascial closure and the risk of fistulas after nontrauma lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract surgery treated with OA.

Methods

This retrospective study included 101 nontrauma patients treated with OA from 2007 to 2011. Multivariate analyses of risk factors were performed.

Results

Indications for OA were diffuse peritonitis (n = 47), need for second look (n = 26), failure to achieve fascial closure (e.g., bowel edema) at primary laparotomy (n = 24), and fascial necrosis (n = 4). Of the 101 patients, 61 (60%) were alive at discharge, with one death possibly related to OA (fistula from an iatrogenic perforation). Delayed fascial closure was obtained in 40 (66%) of the surviving patients, with 80% when the indications for OA was need for second look and 72% in cases of diffuse peritonitis. Compared with need for second look [hazard ratio (HR = 1), 95% CI], proportional HR for failure of delayed fascial closure were peritonitis 1.96 (1.10–3.49) and failure to achieve fascial closure at primary laparotomy 4.70 (2.17–10.2). In the presence of a stoma the HR was 2.02 (1.13–3.63).

Conclusions

OA using NPWT seems to be a safe procedure, with few procedure-related complications. Failure of fascial closure is related to the indication of OA and the presence of a stoma. Prospective multicenter studies are needed to establish which patients with lower GI surgery benefit from OA.

### The role of the open abdomen procedure in managing severe abdominal sepsis: WSES position paper [^111Zxuq1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Early fascial closure is commonly performed within 4–7 days days of the initial laparostomy. Primary fascial closure can be achieved in many cases within few days from the initial operation without technical difficulties. Patients having abdominal sepsis are less likely to achieve an early fascial closure it should be performed as soon as possible after severe abdominal sepsis is controlled.

Ideally, the fascia should be closed in patients whose adequate source control is performed with no further planned surgical intervention, severe sepsis is controlled and fascial closure is feasible without relevant increase of IAP.

However, patients undergoing primary fascial closure need strict monitor of their status to assess the possibility of a definitive operation. An early fascia-to-fascia closure can not be successful if early surgical source control fails.

Restrictive fluid resuscitation may be suggested for the hemodynamic support of critically ill patients with abdominal sepsis. Some evidence exists to support implementing restrictive fluid therapy protocols in critically ill patients with abdominal sepsis and IAH.

In these patients, fluid resuscitation should be controlled to avoid fluids overload, which may aggravate gut oedema and lead to increased intra-abdominal pressure. Reduction of bowel oedema with a conservative fluid resuscitation may increase the chances for early definitive abdominal closure. Intra-vesical measurements of IAP should be frequently performed in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock of abdominal origin, to monitor the trend of IAP and decide the timing of fascial closure.

It has been proposed that leaving patients with open abdomen on continuous neuromuscular blockade (NMB) can improve closure rates. However, the current evidence comparing continuous NMB to simple sedation is equivocal. Active diuresis is often used to decrease bowel and abdominal wall oedema and facilitate fascial closure. Yet, there is no convincing data to suggest that use of diuretics improves the rate or time to closure.

Delayed fascial closure is defined as fascial abdominal closure achieved 7 or more days after the initial OA procedure. The delayed abdominal wall closure may be often problematic because of fascial edges lateralization leading to unfavourably high tensile midline forces. Abdominal wall closure should be performed by approximating the fascial edges progressively and incrementally, each time the patient undergoes surgery until it is completely closed.

### The open abdomen in trauma and non-trauma patients: WSES guidelines [^114C4tUC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Damage control resuscitation may lead to postoperative intra-abdominal hypertension or abdominal compartment syndrome. These conditions may result in a vicious, self-perpetuating cycle leading to severe physiologic derangements and multiorgan failure unless interrupted by abdominal (surgical or other) decompression. Further, in some clinical situations, the abdomen cannot be closed due to the visceral edema, the inability to control the compelling source of infection or the necessity to re-explore (as a "planned second-look" laparotomy) or complete previously initiated damage control procedures or in cases of abdominal wall disruption. The open abdomen in trauma and non-trauma patients has been proposed to be effective in preventing or treating deranged physiology in patients with severe injuries or critical illness when no other perceived options exist. Its use, however, remains controversial as it is resource consuming and represents a non-anatomic situation with the potential for severe adverse effects. Its use, therefore, should only be considered in patients who would most benefit from it. Abdominal fascia-to-fascia closure should be done as soon as the patient can physiologically tolerate it. All precautions to minimize complications should be implemented.

### Vacuum-assisted closure versus on-demand relaparotomy in patients with secondary peritonitis-the VACOR trial: protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^114a6RQm]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Vacuum-assisted closure

The VAC® Abdominal Dressing System (KCI Vacuum Assisted Closure, San Antonio, TX, USA) will be used. A video illustrating the procedure is attached in the supplementary material (Additional File 1). Intestines, including lateral aspects, are covered by the visceral protective layer. The first layer of foam is placed in the laparostoma on top of the visceral protective layer and must extend below the fascia at a distance of 5 cm from the fascial opening. Above this, a minimum of one piece of foam is folded and placed in the laparostoma. Finally, the laparostoma will be covered by the occlusive drape. A circular opening of approximately 5 cm in diameter will be created in the drape where the connection tubes to the vacuum pump will be placed. Simultaneously, while applying the negative pressure of 125 mmHg, the wound edges are approximated manually towards the midline. The dressing will be changed at an interval of approximately 48 h as standard or whenever needed according to the clinical condition. Each dressing change must be performed with the patient under general anaesthesia and muscle relaxation in the operating theatre. Peritoneal fluid must be cultured at each dressing change and when the fascia is closed. The fascial closure can, in some instances, be difficult due to swelling or the physical inability to close the abdomen. It must commence as soon as possible, judging by intra-abdominal findings, gastrointestinal function, and renal function. The aim will be to close the abdomen within eight days after the index operation.

The fascia closure after VAC treatment can be according to Israelsson's principle, as described below, or at the surgeon's discretion. A staged closure may start distally, proximally, or in combination. To ensure the uniformity of intervention in the arm receiving the open management, we have produced a video where the application of the VAC system is demonstrated in a step-by-step manner, as well as providing training for centres not familiar with the technique.

Primary closure

The Israelsson principle includes a running suture of the fascia with a distance of 5 mm between the stitches of 5 mm and the distance to the fascial edge of 5–10 mm. Monofilament PDS 2–0 or equivalent is used. The suturing is started cranially and caudally, and the sutures are tied with self-locking knots. Approximately four times as much suture material as the length of the wound must be used or more. The peritoneal fluid must be cultured at closure.

### The open abdomen, indications, management and definitive closure [^112deZtt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The indications for Open Abdomen (OA) are generally all those situations in which is ongoing the development an intra-abdominal hypertension condition (IAH), in order to prevent the development of abdominal compartmental syndrome (ACS). In fact all those involved in care of a critically ill patient should in the first instance think how to prevent IAH and ACS. In case of ACS goal directed therapy to achieve early opening and early closure is the key: paradigm of closure shifts to combination of therapies including negative pressure wound therapy and dynamic closure, in order to reduce complications and avoid incisional hernia. There have been huge studies and progress in survival of critically ill trauma and septic surgical patients: this in part has been through the great work of pioneers, scientific societies and their guidelines; however future studies and continued innovation are needed to better understand optimal treatment strategies and to define more clearly the indications, because OA by itself is still a morbid procedure.

### Updated guideline for closure of abdominal wall incisions from the European and American hernia societies [^1129HRVY]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Limitations

These updated guidelines summarize the studies of abdominal wall closure in adults undergoing abdominal surgery. The major limitation of this guideline reflects the limited quantity and/or quality of the studies available to answer the KQs. This makes it impossible to formulate strong recommendations for any of the KQs according to the GRADE methodology. The majority of studies reported on the incidence of burst abdomen, SSI, and incisional hernia. Patient-reported outcomes, such as pain, abdominal wall function and cosmesis, were reported rarely. Data were limited or lacking for emergency surgery and surgery in obese patients, and recommendations for these patients could not be made. Although the guidelines group aimed to represent all stakeholders and surgical specialties, it would have benefited from participation of a gynaecological surgeon and physiotherapist. Care was taken to create subgroups without group members who authored a paper relevant to the KQ or with other conflicts of interest. However, all group members use meshes and sutures, and are involved in hernia prevention, which might have influenced appraisal of the evidence and formulation of recommendations. Efforts were made to have active patient participation, but unfortunately not all group meetings had patient representation. A patient representative critically reviewed the guidelines and their valuable comments were included.

Implementation

To aid dissemination and implementation, the guideline will be presented at international and national conferences, and summaries will be written in different languages for national journals. Implementation of standard closure techniques in elective and emergency laparotomies has been described in detail, and shown to reduce the incidence of incisional hernia and burst abdomen. Before implementation of the recommendations, surgeons may need some extra education and/or training in the techniques. Monitoring of this process, complications, and feedback are important. Surgical procedures can be performed in different positions (such as lateral) and on patients in special conditions (for example, pregnancy), which require special considerations when choosing location of incision, approach, and closure techniques. For these reasons, separate papers on the applicability of the guidelines specifically for urological, gynaecological and vascular procedures and patients will be written. Another barrier to implementation of these guidelines may be the added costs of, and time taken, for a surgical procedure, especially in low- and middle-income countries. However, reduction in the incidence of incisional hernia has been proven to reduce healthcare costs, and even the use of prophylactic mesh has been calculated to be more cost-effective than suture closure alone. Given the additional studies identified for this update, it is planned to update these guidelines 5 years after publication using the GRADE methodology.

### Vacuum-assisted closure versus on-demand relaparotomy in patients with secondary peritonitis-the VACOR trial: protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^117K8ZaS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Randomisation

Patients are included by a surgical equipoise followed by patient information and consent after recovery. The on-call surgeon will contact the primary investigator from each site when a patient is scheduled for diagnostic laparoscopy or explorative laparotomy on suspicion of secondary peritonitis. Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be randomised after consent has been obtained by the surgical equipoise (Fig. 1). This could occur before, during, or at the end of index laparotomy, disclosing a complete overview of all potential candidates. Most patients will be able to receive both treatments regardless of what arm they are allocated without changing the treatment regimen. However, there will be some exceptions where it is necessary to modify or change the surgical treatment, irrespective of the randomisation allocation. Centres that do not receive approval from their respective scientific ethics committee to include patients through a surgical equipoise must obtain informed and written consent before randomisation. Randomisation will be web-based via (REDCap ®) in blocks of 2, 4, and 6 stratified for centre and age above or below 65 years. The justifications for stratifying according to the centre are that there might be differences in the surgical treatment, preoperative optimisation, and postoperative treatment, both in the ward and intensive care unit (ICU), which might affect the outcome. The patients will be randomised to either abdominal closure with ROD or open abdomen with VAC according to transparent reporting of trials (CONSORT) (Fig. 2). The randomisation tool and eligibility criteria can be accessed through our website.

In cases where the surgeon finds that the allocated treatment may be contraindicated or is judged to harm the patient, it will be left to the surgeon's discretion to choose the most appropriate treatment. In cases where the bowels are left stapled in discontinuity as a part of the damage control principle, the patient's fascia cannot be closed due to swelling or the presence of abdominal compartment VAC treatment may be applied irrespective of the randomisation. These patients remain in the trial for an intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis. By excluding such patients, there might be a risk of selection bias. Any eligible patient not included will be registered in a screening log.

Preoperative patient assessment

The patients are preoperatively assessed according to Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) to determine the degree of organ dysfunction.

### Small-bites versus large-bites closure of midline laparotomies: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113qSaDE]. Colorectal Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Overall, small bites is associated with lower rates of SSI and IH when a meta‐analysis is performed of existing evidence combining retrospective and randomized data. The evidence supporting this is only significant for IH rates when examining RCTs, with fragility evident among existing randomized studies highlighting a requirement for further detailed data in this area.

To our knowledge this is the first meta‐analysis to compare surgical outcomes of small‐bites technique versus the standard large‐bites technique in terms of patient risk factors and incidence of SSI, wound dehiscence and IH with an examination of the fragility of randomized studies. At a glance the available literature supports the adoption of small bites, especially considering the latest European Hernia Society guidelines; however, the data are highly heterogenous. On one hand we have a group of retrospective case–control studies, some included here, that favour small bites, but we found significant differences in terms of patient selection, such as fewer men or fewer emergency procedures in the SG. These weaken the evidence due to the high risk of selection bias. More so, the studies were designed to compare a standardized technique of closing the abdomen, through small‐bites adoption, versus a nonstandardized historical way, based on surgeon preference. This implies another important risk of selection and performance bias, because in the CG the closure could have been performed in various ways. Thus, the favourable results in the SG may be attributed to the standardized and thorough way of closing the abdomen rather than the suture or technique itself. On the other hand, we have the evidence provided by RCTs, namely the STITCH trial, the ESTOIH trial and a newly published trial from Ozcan et al. The trial published by Millbourn et al. in 2009 was considered a CCT due to the weak randomization method (by alternating weeks). When analysing only RCTs, the preoperative risk factors were all similar between the two groups. Also, in all RCTs the operative variables were measured, emphasizing more robust evidence as in all patients the wound length was measured, closure was done similarly in both groups and sutures were measured in both groups confirming adherence to the allocated technique. Interestingly, in Millbourn et al. despite using a 5/5 mm closure in the SG versus a 10/10 mm one in the CG, the suture length and suture to wound length ratio were smaller for the small‐bites technique, which is difficult to explain for a technique where more bites and less suture are used.

### Temporary closure of the open abdomen: a systematic review on delayed primary fascial closure in patients with an open abdomen [^114G7E75]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Fascial closure

For the purpose of this study, the authors pooled the results per technique. The artificial burr, VAC, and dynamic retention sutures seemed to produce the highest rates of delayed primary fascial closure. These techniques might simply have been superior to the other techniques. However, little information was available on the severity of the underlying condition. Therefore, the higher closure rates might have been due to less severe disease (inclusion bias). An indication for this could be the low mortality rates in these series; however, this remains speculation.

As mentioned in Materials and methods, the authors calculated the delayed primary fascial closure rate for all included patients. This was done because the moment of death (before or after closure) often was not recorded. However, it is likely that many patients died before closure. Therefore, the delayed fascial closure rate of the survivors might have been higher than the rates reported above. This applies to all TAC techniques.

Some techniques were used in hundreds of patients, whereas others were used in less than 20 patients. Although the authors considered this by weighing the rates of delayed fascial closure rate and mortality, the reliability of the weighted estimate of fascial closure per series differs.

Fistulae and abscesses

Fistulae and abscesses were the most consistently reported complications. However, the reported rates may be underestimated because, in retrospective chart reviews, complications may be difficult to identify.

Like the fascial closure, the fistulae and abscesses could have been the result of initial peritoneal contamination rather than a function of the TAC technique. Furthermore, a higher likelihood of fistulae or abscesses might have influenced the choice of technique (inclusion bias). Again, this remains speculation.

Mortality

All series reported a mortality rate. Despite the high overall mortality, two series reported no mortality. This is most likely the result of inclusion bias and the small number of patients in these series (8 and 11 patients). The four techniques with the highest delayed fascial closure rates also showed the lowest mortality rates.

Limitations

This systematic review suffers from an unknown but presumably large amount of inclusion bias and lack of standardization of techniques. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether the fascial closure rate and mortality shown in this review are the result of the TAC technique, the severity of the underlying condition, or other factors not included in the retrospective studies. These issues stress that, although this is the strongest evidence in this field of surgery, the conclusions that can be drawn from this systematic review are limited.

### Damage control laparotomy and management of the open abdomen [^1174WRLd]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Management of the open abdomen has been used for decades by general surgeons. Techniques have evolved over those decades to improve control of infection, fluid loss, and improve the ability to close the abdomen to avoid hernia formation. The authors explore the history, indications, and techniques of open abdomen management in multiple settings. The most important considerations in open abdomen management include the reason for leaving the abdomen open, prevention and mitigation of ongoing organ dysfunction, and eventual plans for abdominal closure.

### New non-invasive device to promote primary closure of the fascia and prevent loss of domain in the open abdomen: a pilot study [^117My92h]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

The intention-to-treat principle was applied to analysis of outcomes. Baseline characteristics and the outcomes are described using means and SD for continuous data, and counts and proportions for categorical data. The primary outcome was compared between groups using the χ² test. The treatment effect was expressed as the difference in proportions with successful closure and the 95% CI. All analyses were performed using SAS (Statistical Analysis System) V.9.4 (SAS Institute); data are reported as mean ± SD. All tests were two sided and statistical significance was defined with the p value < 0.05.

### Primary fascial closure during minimally invasive ventral hernia repair… [^1131YkAU]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Each year, more than 400 000 ventral hernia repairs are performed in the United States. 1 Multiple randomized clinical trials2 have shown that laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, compared with open repair, can decrease surgical site infections and hospital length of stay with no difference in hernia recurrence. Despite this, less than one-fourth of ventral hernias are repaired using a laparoscopic technique. 1, 2. Bernardi K, Olavarria OA, Liang MK.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^114PMYyR]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Surgical Infection Society guideline — rating scale for recommendations distinguishes a strong recommendation when the task force concluded the intervention is a desirable approach for applicable patients, generally based on moderate to high quality evidence, unlikely to change with future research, with magnitude sufficient to justify the recommendation and also used when interventions are likely to have a significant effect on patient outcome even if based on weak evidence; a weak recommendation when the intervention is a reasonable approach but not all patients or clinicians would necessarily follow it, a decision not to follow is unlikely to result in a major adverse outcome, and the rating is generally based on weak to moderate quality evidence with future research potentially altering magnitude and direction; and no recommendation when evidence is inadequate or too inconsistent to reach a meaningful conclusion.
