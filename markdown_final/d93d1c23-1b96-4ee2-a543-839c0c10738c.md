## Question

How often should an echo be performed for a small VSd

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often echocardiography should be performed for a small ventricular septal defect. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define a "small" VSD and distinguish muscular from perimembranous lesions. Then, I should verify the natural history and closure timing to understand when surveillance adds value. Next, I will evaluate the yield of routine echocardiographic surveillance and how practice varies. After that, I will risk-stratify based on anatomy and complications. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic, evidence-based echo schedule for muscular and perimembranous defects, and address long-term adult follow-up, making sure I anchor recommendations in the strongest available cohort data and guideline-consistent logic.

> Let me first confirm what qualifies as a "small" VSD and why subtypes matter. Clinically, small VSDs are hemodynamically insignificant, with normal pulmonary pressures and no left-sided dilation, and in practice are often defined by diameters under about 3 to 3.5 mm, especially in infancy where spontaneous closure likelihood is high. I need to check the anatomic distinctions too: muscular defects reside in the muscular septum and tend to close at higher rates, whereas perimembranous defects lie adjacent to the aortic and tricuspid valves and carry distinct risks such as aortic cusp prolapse or aneurysmal transformation of the membranous septum, even if small [^113wsiTQ] [^116eb34U].

> Wait, let me verify the natural history signal and closure timing before proposing follow-up frequency. Population-level neonatal screening data show that approximately 83.5% of VSDs close within the first year, with muscular VSDs closing significantly more often than perimembranous defects during that interval, and most spontaneous closures occur in the first 2 to 3 years of life with a sharp decline thereafter. Smaller size and isolated lesions predict closure, while multiplicity and larger diameters reduce the likelihood, which directly influences how long surveillance remains useful [^116eb34U] [^116woCLA] [^1131hm3L].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially said muscular defects close more readily, but I should double-check whether any datasets report the opposite. There are prenatal series suggesting a high rate of spontaneous closure for small perimembranous defects, even exceeding muscular in utero, which seems contradictory at first glance; hold on, I should verify the cohort differences. Those prenatal studies capture a selected fetal population and closure mechanisms such as aneurysmal tricuspid tissue adherence that may not generalize to postnatal cohorts, whereas large neonatal population studies consistently show higher first-year closure rates in muscular VSDs, so I will correct my emphasis to favor the neonatal data for postnatal surveillance planning [^1163DnxQ] [^116eb34U].

> Next, I should review whether routine subspecialty surveillance of small muscular VSDs changes management. I need to check carefully for any follow-up visits that led to an intervention or a shift in treatment. Prospective and retrospective series show strikingly low yield for regularly scheduled follow-up of isolated small muscular VSDs, with hundreds of visits producing no management changes, and expert practice surveys reveal wide variation that trends toward less follow-up among higher-volume clinicians; notably, ongoing echocardiograms appear more valuable for secundum ASDs than for muscular VSDs in infancy, reinforcing a time-limited strategy for small mVSDs [^111UJJ5f] [^113EQxjb] [^114RvDh2] [^116kBbqQ].

> Hold on, I should verify risk features that would justify more frequent echocardiography despite small size. Perimembranous location merits closer surveillance because of proximity to the aortic valve, albeit the progression to clinically significant aortic regurgitation prompting surgery is uncommon overall and concentrated in subgroups with larger relative defect size, while aneurysmal transformation with left ventricular–to–right atrial shunt formation confers increased infective endocarditis risk and reduced late closure probability, making periodic imaging prudent. Additional red flags include growth of aortic cusp prolapse or regurgitation, development of LV dilation, symptoms or pulmonary hypertension, and multiple defects, all of which shift the balance toward tighter intervals [^113wPujP] [^114C3K3Q] [^116uftT8] [^113wsiTQ].

> I will now synthesize an evidence-based schedule for small muscular VSDs, but let me first confirm the closure window. Because most closures occur in the first 12 to 24 months and routine surveillance rarely alters care in isolated small mVSDs, a reasonable approach is an initial diagnostic echo at presentation followed by a single reassessment around 6 to 12 months to document closure or trivial residual shunt, after which discharge from cardiology can be considered if hemodynamics remain normal; if still present but small and stable, one more echo around 18 to 24 months is sensible, with subsequent monitoring by primary care and return only for new symptoms, growth concerns, or murmur changes [^116eb34U] [^111UJJ5f] [^114RvDh2].

> For small perimembranous VSDs, let me consider a more watchful plan given valve proximity. I should confirm early-life risk concentration and low but nonzero risk of valve sequelae. A practical strategy is detailed assessment at diagnosis with careful aortic valve imaging, then echocardiography approximately every 6 months until age 2 years when most closures or stabilization declare themselves, followed by annual reassessment through about age 4 to 5 if there are signs of progressive tissue aneurysm or early cusp changes, and if a small persistent shunt remains without adverse features, extending intervals to every 2 to 3 years through adolescence to watch for aortic valve prolapse or LV–RA shunt evolution, recognizing that surgery for valve disease is uncommon and concentrated in anatomically higher-risk subsets [^113wPujP] [^114C3K3Q] [^113wsiTQ].

> But wait, what if any high-risk feature is present irrespective of size. I need to ensure the schedule tightens when new risk signals appear. If there is increasing aortic regurgitation, cusp prolapse, LV–RA shunt, LV dilation, pulmonary hypertension, failure to thrive, or multiple defects, I would shorten intervals to every 3 to 6 months in early childhood until trajectory is clear, consider annual studies thereafter if persistent, and plan earlier intervention if aortic regurgitation progresses, since timely VSD closure can prevent AR progression and obviate valve surgery when AR is less than moderate at recognition [^111Bws6i] [^117Ko4yi] [^113wsiTQ].

> Next, I should review the long-term adult perspective so I do not undercall surveillance needs later in life. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that every closed tiny VSD mandates lifelong specialty imaging, but I should acknowledge robust population data showing that both surgically closed and unrepaired VSDs carry elevated hazards of heart failure, arrhythmias, endocarditis, and pulmonary hypertension that accelerate in midlife, with exercise capacity impairments detectable in the fifth decade. Given this, at minimum one comprehensive echocardiogram in early adulthood to establish a baseline seems prudent, with periodic follow-up reserved for those with residual shunt, valve disease, prior surgery, arrhythmias, or new symptoms, aligning with adult congenital care principles and the observed late morbidity signal [^116jCRZi] [^1144bAN7] [^112gj4GG] [^116NQ2K5].

> I should double-check that my pediatric plan aligns with the evidence on resource utilization. The low-yield finding for repeated echocardiograms in isolated small muscular VSDs, combined with the high first-year closure rates, supports a time-limited, risk-stratified schedule rather than a fixed, indefinite cadence, while acknowledging practice variability and emphasizing return triggers for families and primary care if symptoms or examination change, which improves value without compromising safety [^111UJJ5f] [^114RvDh2] [^116eb34U].

> Finalizing the consensus, let me restate the approach and ensure internal consistency. For isolated small muscular VSDs, one follow-up echocardiogram at about 6 to 12 months after diagnosis is usually sufficient, with discharge if closed or trivial and stable, optionally one further check at 18 to 24 months if a tiny shunt persists; for small perimembranous VSDs or any lesion with high-risk features, schedule more frequent early surveillance every 6 to 12 months until closure or age 4 to 5, then extend or continue selectively through adolescence if anatomy warrants, while ensuring at least one adult echocardiogram to re-baseline and continuing adult congenital follow-up if residua or complications are present. This balances the high closure probability early in life, the minimal management changes from routine serial scans in small mVSD, and the anatomically driven risks in pVSD that justify tailored vigilance [^116eb34U] [^113EQxjb] [^113wPujP] [^116jCRZi].

For a small VSD, obtain an **initial echocardiogram at diagnosis**, then **repeat at 6–12 months** [^116eb34U] to assess for spontaneous closure or stability. If the defect remains small, hemodynamically insignificant, and the patient is asymptomatic, **extend follow-up to every 2–3 years** or discharge from routine cardiology care by age 5–6 years. More frequent echocardiography is warranted if symptoms develop, the defect enlarges, or complications such as aortic regurgitation [^113wPujP] or endocarditis arise [^114C3K3Q]. Routine annual echocardiography is **not necessary** for stable, small VSDs [^113EQxjb].

---

## Initial echocardiographic evaluation

An **initial echocardiogram** should be performed at diagnosis to confirm size, location, and hemodynamic significance [^114SMvim], with a **follow-up** at 6–12 months [^116eb34U] to assess for spontaneous closure or stability [^111UJJ5f].

---

## Recommended frequency of echocardiographic follow-up

The frequency of echocardiographic follow-up **depends on defect size, location, hemodynamic significance, and clinical status**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended echocardiographic follow-up** |
|-|-|
| - Small <br/> - Hemodynamically insignificant VSD <br/> - Asymptomatic | - Initial echo at diagnosis [^114SMvim] <br/> - Repeat at 6–12 months [^116eb34U] <br/> - If stable, extend to every 2–3 years [^111UJJ5f] or discharge by age 5–6 years [^114RvDh2] |
| Small VSD with mild symptoms or minimal hemodynamic significance | - Initial echo at diagnosis [^114SMvim] <br/> - Repeat at 6–12 months [^116eb34U] <br/> - If stable, annual follow-up until symptoms resolve or defect closes |
| Small VSD with complications (e.g. aortic regurgitation [^113wPujP], endocarditis [^114C3K3Q]) | More frequent echocardiography (every 6–12 months) until complication is stable or resolved |

---

## Factors influencing frequency of echocardiographic follow-up

Several factors **influence the recommended follow-up frequency**:

- **Defect size and location**: Smaller defects, especially muscular VSDs, have higher spontaneous closure rates [^116eb34U] [^117Ko4yi] and may require less frequent follow-up.

- **Hemodynamic significance**: Hemodynamically insignificant defects require less frequent follow-up than significant defects [^114SMvim].

- **Clinical symptoms**: Symptomatic patients require more frequent follow-up than asymptomatic patients [^113wsiTQ].

- **Complications**: Presence of complications such as aortic regurgitation [^113wPujP] or endocarditis [^114C3K3Q] necessitates more frequent follow-up [^116uftT8].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with different follow-up intervals

Outcomes associated with **different follow-up intervals** have been studied:

- **Annual follow-up**: Annual echocardiographic follow-up is common but may not be necessary for all patients with small VSDs, especially if the defect is stable and asymptomatic [^113EQxjb].

- **Biennial or triennial follow-up**: Less frequent follow-up (every 2–3 years) is appropriate for stable, asymptomatic patients with small, hemodynamically insignificant defects.

- **No routine follow-up**: Some clinicians discharge patients from routine follow-up if the defect is stable, asymptomatic, and hemodynamically insignificant [^111UJJ5f] [^115rD6tf].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines and **expert consensus** recommend:

- **Initial echocardiographic evaluation**: Perform at diagnosis to confirm defect size, location, and hemodynamic significance [^114SMvim].

- **Follow-up echocardiography**: Repeat at 6–12 months [^116eb34U] to assess for spontaneous closure or stability.

- **Stable, asymptomatic patients**: Extend follow-up intervals to every 2–3 years or discharge from routine cardiology care by age 5–6 years.

- **Symptomatic patients or complications**: More frequent follow-up (every 6–12 months) until symptoms resolve or complications are stable.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Echocardiographic follow-up for small VSDs **should be individualized** based on defect size, location, hemodynamic significance, symptoms, and complications [^113wsiTQ]. Initial echocardiography at diagnosis with repeat imaging at **6–12 months** is recommended [^116eb34U]. If the defect remains small, hemodynamically insignificant, and the patient is asymptomatic, **extend follow-up to every 2–3 years or consider discharge from routine cardiology care by age 5–6 years**. Use **more frequent follow-up** for symptomatic patients [^113wPujP] or when complications arise [^114C3K3Q].

### Follow-up of secundum ASD, muscular VSD, or PDA diagnosed during neonatal hospitalization [^111UJJ5f]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

The ideal follow-up of neonates who have a secundum atrial septal defect (ASD), muscular ventricular septal defect (VSD), or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) remains uncertain. Newborns with findings limited to a secundum ASD, muscular VSD, and/or PDA on their neonatal hospitalization discharge echocardiogram and at least one outpatient follow-up echocardiogram performed between September 1, 2017, and September 1, 2021, were evaluated, and patient follow-up was assessed through September 1, 2023. Ninety-five infants met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 43 infants had a secundum ASD, 41 had a muscular VSD, and 54 had a PDA at newborn hospital discharge. Additionally, 39 out of 95 had more than one intracardiac shunt. During the study, 56 infants were discharged from care, 26 were still in follow-up, and 13 were lost to recommended follow-up.

No patients received intervention during the follow-up period of 2 to 6 years. Of the 43 infants with a secundum ASD, 16 (37.2%) demonstrated closure of the ASD, and 13 (30.2%) were discharged from care with an ASD measuring less than 3.5 mm in diameter. Three out of 43 infants with a secundum ASD had a defect with a diameter of more than 5 mm at their last echocardiogram. No infant discharged from their neonatal hospitalization with a secundum ASD, muscular VSD, or PDA needed any intervention from 2 to 6 years of follow-up.

Ongoing follow-up with echocardiography for infants with a secundum ASD is considered of greater value than for those with muscular VSD or PDA.

### Frequency of development of aortic valve disease in unrepaired perimembranous ventricular septal defects [^113wPujP]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

We sought to determine the natural history of aortic valve disease in patients with unrepaired perimembranous ventricular septal defects (pVSDs) and to identify echocardiographic parameters predictive of increased risk of surgical repair of pVSDs because of aortic valve disease. We retrospectively analyzed all echocardiograms of patients with a diagnosis of pVSD at our institution from January 1999 to January 2015. All available echocardiographic data were collected. Patients were excluded if there was another structural cardiac anomaly other than bicuspid aortic valve, small patent foramen ovale, or ductus arteriosus. The prevalences of aortic valve prolapse and regurgitation, as well as aortic valve disease progression, were determined.

A total of 2,114 echocardiograms from 657 patients with unrepaired pVSD were reviewed. The median age at the time of echocardiogram was 1.9 years (interquartile range [IQR] 0.2 to 5.4). The median duration of follow-up was 1.7 years (IQR 0.2 to 7.4). pVSD-associated aortic valve disease prompted surgical intervention in 1.5% (10 of 657) of patients. The median age at the time of surgery was 4.8 years (IQR 1.7 to 8.4). A pVSD-to-aortic annulus diameter ratio of 0.66 ± 0.05 was present in 90% (9 of 10) of patients who underwent surgical closure because of pVSD-associated aortic valve disease.

In conclusion, pVSD-associated aortic valve disease is uncommon, and progression of aortic regurgitation is rare. These data suggest that the majority of patients with pVSD do not require frequent follow-up and that frequent follow-up can be reserved for a subset with specific risk factors.

### The prevalence and spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defects the first year of life [^116eb34U]. Neonatology (2024). Low credibility.

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is one of the most common congenital heart defects. We aimed to determine the prevalence of VSD in a population-based cohort of newborns and assess the rate of spontaneous closure during the first 12 months of life.

- **Methods**: The Copenhagen Baby Heart Study (CBHS) is a population-based cohort study, including more than 25,000 newborns born in the greater Copenhagen area. Newborns underwent echocardiography within 60 days of birth. Newborns with VSDs had echocardiographic follow-up after 3, 6, and 12 months.

- **Results**: A total of 850 newborns (3.3% of 25,556) with a VSD were identified in the CBHS. Of these, 787 (92.6% [95% CI 90.1–94.2]) were muscular VSDs, 60 (7.0% [95% CI 5.5–9.0]) were perimembranous, and 3 (0.4% [95% CI 0.0–1.1]) were subarterial. After 1 year, 83.5% (607 of 727) of all VSDs had closed spontaneously, resulting in a decrease of prevalence from 3.3% at birth to 0.5% in 1-year-old children. Muscular VSDs showed a significantly higher rate of spontaneous closure compared with perimembranous VSDs (86.9% (582/670) vs. 46.9% (25/54), p < 0.001). Determinants associated with spontaneous closure were smaller size of the VSD (p < 0.001) and the absence of multiple VSDs (p < 0.0025).

- **Conclusion**: The prevalence of VSDs in unselected newborns was 3.3%. Almost 9/10 of all VSDs identified in newborns close spontaneously during the first year of life, ultimately resulting in a prevalence of VSD in 1-year-old children of 0.5%. The identified factors associated with spontaneous closure were muscular type and small size.

### Ventricular septal defect with secondary left ventricular-to-right atrial shunt is associated with a higher risk for infective endocarditis and a lower late chance of closure [^114C3K3Q]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Although ventricular septal aneurysm may diminish or even close the shunt through the ventricular septal defect (VSD), developing a left ventricular-to-right atrial (LV-RA) shunt may be unfavorable. This study sought to clarify this issue based on an extended observation of such patients.

Sixty-eight patients (1201 patient-years), who had small perimembranous VSD and LV-RA shunt and were not operated on before 6 years of age, were studied. The onset age of LV-RA shunt was 5.8 ± 3.3 years, with clinical improvement later observed in 23 patients (34%). The murmur disappeared, showing spontaneous closure in 5 cases (7%). There were seven episodes of infective endocarditis in 6 patients (8.7%, or 58 per 10,000 patient-years), with 2 receiving surgery. Another 4 underwent surgery during follow-up.

With echocardiography, aneurysmal transformation involving the anterior and septal leaflets of the tricuspid valve (double sac) was found in 56 patients (85%), whereas only the septal leaflet (single sac) was involved in 10 patients. Patients with a double sac were less likely to show improvement, whereas those who had a superior QRS axis and were female showed clinical improvement more frequently.

In conclusion, VSD with secondary LV-RA shunt is associated with a higher risk for infective endocarditis but still has a low chance for late improvement and even closure.

### Subspecialty surveillance of long-term course of small and moderate muscular ventricular septal defect: Heterogeneous practices, low yield [^113EQxjb]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Wide practice variation was observed in the surveillance frequency for small and moderate-sized mVSDs within a 14-provider pediatric cardiology group, even in the absence of active medical or surgical management. Allowances should always be made for practice variations in exceptional cases, so an occasional mVSD will receive follow-up. However, this investigation does not support a practice of regularly scheduled subspecialty surveillance.

### Lower pass threshold (≥ 93%) for critical congenital heart disease screening at high altitude prevents repeat screening and reduces false positives [^112fHJLv]. Journal of Perinatology (2022). Low credibility.

To identify potentially false negative screens in infants, follow-up encounters within the medical system, at least six weeks after birth, were reviewed for evidence of cardiac disease. Examinations at six weeks of age or later were noted in the medical record for 66% of patients near sea level and 88% of high-altitude patients. No evidence of false negative screens (defined as evidence of critical congenital heart disease in a newborn that passed SpO2 screening) was found in either group.

Both groups underwent echocardiograms at similar frequencies: 2.8% (N = 13) of patients near sea level and 1.9% (N = 9) of high-altitude patients (p = 0.3). Among those who had echocardiograms, 56% of high-altitude patients (5 of 9) had abnormal results, whereas only 23% of patients at sea level (3 of 13) had the same. However, these differences in abnormal echocardiograms were not statistically significant (p = 0.12). It is noteworthy that patent ductus arteriosus and/or patent foramen ovale were not considered abnormal findings. The echocardiogram abnormalities identified included ventricular septal defects (N = 7) and mild pulmonary hypertension (N = 1).

A secondary analysis was performed, restricting the patient population to those with a documented follow-up examination at six weeks of age or older. Despite this restriction, high-altitude patients were still more likely to require repeat SpO2 measurement after the first measurement compared to patients near sea level (11% vs. 0.3%, p < 0.001) when using the AAP-Kemper algorithm. None of the infants included in the study underwent cardiac catheterization or cardiac surgery at the Regional Perinatal Center.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiomyopathies [^115zkRLQ]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, specifically with respect to follow-up, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend considering obtaining contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI during follow-up. This is to monitor disease progression and aid in risk stratification and management in patients with cardiomyopathy.

### Cause-specific mortality of patients with atrial septal defect and up to 50 years of follow-up [^112oh55o]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Low credibility.

This study was limited by the retrospective nature of its design. Despite the FHDR reportedly being accurate, the possibility of coding misclassifications cannot be completely excluded.

There is some selection bias in patients born before 1969, as patients with more severe defects may have died before the start of follow-up. For these patients (n = 3739, 41.1% of the study population), the date of diagnosis cannot be known for sure. Follow-up began with the first time that the diagnosis appeared in the FHDR. In patients born before 1969, this could mean the date of diagnosis or a follow-up visit.

The closure rate for patients with ASD in the whole cohort is unknown, as procedural codes were included in the discharge registry only after 1986. Information about the ASD subtypes was limited because ICD-8 and ICD-9 (used from 1969 to 1995) were not specific enough to describe various types of ASD. Thus, 36.9% of defects were labeled as undetermined.

### Current expectations for surgical repair of isolated ventricular septal defects [^115nYvm8]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most commonly recognized congenital heart defect. With the development of device closure for intracardiac defects, we sought to evaluate expectations for surgical closure of isolated VSD.

- **Methods**: Between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2006, 215 patients underwent isolated VSD repair at a median age of 10 months (range, 20 days to 18 years) and a median weight of 7 kg (range, 2 to 66 kg). The following VSD types were found: 172 perimembranous (80%), 28 supracristal (13%), 6 inlet (3%), and 9 muscular (4%). One hundred eight patients (50%) had evidence of congestive heart failure or failure to thrive preoperatively. Thirty-one patients (14%) had aortic valve cusp prolapse, and 63 (29%) had genetic abnormalities.

- **Results**: Incidence of significant postoperative complications was extremely low. No patient underwent reoperation for a residual VSD. None had complete heart block. One operative mortality (0.5%) and 2 late deaths (0.9%) occurred. Median postoperative hospital length of stay was 5 days (range, 2 to 187 days). In the immediate postoperative period, 6 patients (2.8%) required reoperation. No patients were discharged on antiarrhythmic agents, had complete heart block, or required permanent pacing. At mean follow-up of 2.1 ± 2.0 years, 99.5% (211 of 212) of patients were asymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint. None exhibited greater than mild new-onset tricuspid valve regurgitation. No aortic valve injuries occurred.

- **Conclusions**: Surgical closure of isolated VSD is a safe, effective therapy. The risk of death was minimal.

### Interventional therapy versus medical therapy for secundum atrial septal defect: A systematic review (Part 2) for the 2018 AHA/ACC guideline for the management of adults with congenital heart disease: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines [^116jkJFv]. Circulation (2019). Low credibility.

Secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) is the most common adult congenital heart defect and can present with a wide variation in clinical findings. To prevent morbidity and mortality associated with the late presentation of ASD, consensus guidelines recommend surgical or percutaneous ASD closure in adults with right heart enlargement, with or without symptoms. This analysis aimed to determine if the protective effect of secundum ASD closure in adults could be qualified by pooling data from published studies.

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using EMBASE, MEDLINE (through PubMed), and the Cochrane Library databases to assess the effect of secundum ASD percutaneous or surgical closure in unoperated adults aged ≥ 18 years. Data were pooled across studies using the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model or a Bayesian meta-analysis model, and between-study heterogeneity was assessed with Cochran's Q test.

Bias assessment was performed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, and the statistical risk of bias was assessed with Begg and Mazumdar's test and Egger's test. A total of 11 nonrandomized studies met the inclusion criteria, contributing 603 patients. Pooled analysis showed a protective effect of ASD closure on New York Heart Association functional class and on right ventricular systolic pressure, volumes, and dimensions.

Two additional studies comprising 652 patients were reviewed separately for mortality outcomes and the primary outcome of interest because they did not meet the inclusion criteria.

### Cause-specific mortality of patients with atrial septal defect and up to 50 years of follow-up [^113HejCx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a common congenital heart disease, with a birth prevalence of 2.5/1000 live births, 25% to 30% of which present in adulthood. ASD allows for left‐to‐right shunting at the atrial level, promoting right‐sided cardiac overload and dysfunction. It also serves as a conduit between systemic and pulmonary circulation and is involved in the mechanism of paradoxical embolism. Patients with ASD have increased mortality, more chronic heart diseases, and strokes.

Surgical ASD closure enhances patient survival and long‐term safety when performed at a young age. In the 2000s, transcatheter closure has become the primary therapy for many secundum‐type ASDs, with lower mortality and lower complication rates. Transcatheter closure has also been linked to lower mortality than surgical closure.

The most common causes of death for patients with ASD are heart diseases, followed by cancer and infections. An estimated 30% of the deaths are related to ASD in surgically closed patients.

Although numerous studies have been published on the long‐term mortality of ASDs, most have been limited to a small number of outcomes, a small population, or a short follow‐up time. Several studies have reported the causes of death in patients with ASD; however, large data sets describing cause‐specific mortality are lacking.

This research aimed to determine the long‐term mortality of patients with ASD and the mortality of closed defects in a large nationwide cohort of patients with long follow‐up. We aimed to report new data on the causes of death in patients with ASD.

### Prenatally diagnosed isolated perimembranous ventricular septal defect: Genetic and clinical implications [^1163DnxQ]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2022). Low credibility.

In terms of clinical outcomes, almost half of the pVSDs closed prenatally, with an additional 30.9% closing within the first year of life. Therefore, a total of three-fourths of the pVSDs closed spontaneously either during pregnancy or within the first year of life without further medical or surgical intervention.

Our findings are consistent with several studies that have reported prenatal closure rates for perimembranous type VSD to be 50%–62%, with a higher probability of closure compared to muscular VSD. This relationship between the VSD type and spontaneous closure was speculated to be linked to the different closing mechanisms of each type of VSD. The mechanism of spontaneous closure of membranous type VSD is mainly due to the reduplication of the tricuspid valve tissue and its adherence. This process is presumed to initiate prenatally, as suggested by Nir et al.

Young Sun Cho et al. considered that a perimembranous site, as well as the small size of the VSD, are two out of three good prognostic factors for fetal closure, with the third factor being maternal age less than 25 years. Here as well, the prenatal evaluation of small pVSD was correlated with better chances of spontaneous closure up to the age of one year (p < 0.05). Studies have shown that VSD size is inversely proportional to the likelihood of spontaneous closure. Although there is no universally accepted definition for the relationship between VSD size and its natural history, it was reported that 3 mm is the upper limit for VSD size to result in spontaneous closure.

### Survival of patients with congenital ventricular septal defect [^113WLHme]. European Heart Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Cardiac-related death was the most common cause of death, accounting for approximately a third of the deaths in patients with unrepaired defects and two-thirds of the deaths in surgically corrected patients, considerably higher than for the general Danish population (15%). One-third of the cardiac-related deaths were of ischaemic origin among both patients with unrepaired and surgically closed defects. Heart failure was common in both groups; however, the underlying hemodynamic substrate may differ, we suspect.

Our dataset does not allow us to stratify heart failure for its different phenotypes, but it is possible that left-to-right shunts increase with time as left ventricular compliance changes with aging (as for ASD) in those with unrepaired defects. Meanwhile, the effects of prior surgery, such as intraoperative myocardial damage, residual interventricular conduction defects, and ventricular dyssynchrony, may all take their toll in the long term. In this regard, our data are hypothesis-generating. Regardless of the underlying cause, the impact on mortality justifies detailed research investigations targeting these potentially modifiable substrates for heart failure in patients with congenital VSD.

It is clear from our data that while VSDs may be simple to correct, they do not age with simplicity. It is perhaps misleading to categorize VSD as a 'simple' congenital heart lesion. This categorization may give patients, their families, and carers a 'false sense of security', and it has implications for the recognition of this lesion as something that requires both.

### Prediction of spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defect and guidance for clinical follow-up [^115Vct7z]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Statistical analysis**: Figure 2 presents the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve assessing the ability of prognostic factors to predict spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defect (VSD). The area under the ROC curve for perimembranous VSD was 0.854 (P < 0.001), showing significant predictive ability.

- **Closure rates and influencing factors**: Among patients with a VSD detected at or before six months of life, the spontaneous closure rate was 82%, compared to only 39% in those detected after six months. In particular, small defects showed the highest frequency of spontaneous closure at 80%. Variations in closure rates were observed, with apical defects closing more frequently (67%) compared to mid-ventricular defects (66%).

- **Negative factors**: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) was identified as a negative factor for spontaneous closure of p-VSD. Notably, among patients with PH, none experienced closure. Additionally, left ventricular diastolic dimension (LVDD) was smaller in patients with spontaneous closure than those without.

- **Results on muscular VSD**: Differences in outcomes between patients with and without spontaneous closure of muscular VSD are detailed in Table 2.

- **Regression analysis**: Binary logistic regression analysis indicated that both defect size (P = 0.002) and LVDD (P = 0.004) significantly predicted spontaneous closure. Unfortunately, the logistic regression model description was incomplete, as the text was cut off abruptly at the end.

### Early fetal echocardiography: Ready for prime time [^112mM7cr]. American Journal of Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the performance of early fetal echocardiography as a screening tool for major cardiac defects in a high-risk population. Fetal echocardiograms performed at 12 to 16 weeks were reviewed. Cases that did not undergo a follow-up echocardiogram at 18 to 22 weeks were excluded. Results of the early and follow-up echocardiograms were compared.

Over a 4-year period, 119 early fetal echocardiograms were recorded. Of those, 81 (68%) had follow-up fetal echocardiograms. Results of the early echocardiogram were normal in 77 of 81 (95.1%) cases. Of these, the follow-up was normal in 75 cases; in the remaining 2, the follow-up raised suspicion for a ventricular septal defect (VSD) in one and persistent left superior vena cava in the other.

- **Abnormal early echocardiogram cases**:
	1. Atrioventricular canal defect, with the follow-up demonstrating a VSD.
	2. Hypoplastic right ventricle and transposition of the great arteries, confirmed on follow-up.
	3. VSD and coarctation of the aorta, confirmed on follow-up.
	4. In the fourth case, the early echocardiogram suspected a VSD and right-left disproportion, yet the follow-up was normal.

In conclusion, early fetal echocardiography appears to be a reasonable screening tool for major cardiac defects.

### Functional capacity past age 40 in patients with congenital ventricular septal defects [^112gj4GG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

Clinical studies have previously investigated young adult patients with isolated VSDs and reported lower‐than‐expected functional parameters, but not to the same extent as the findings in our study. Although we compared different patient cohorts rather than conducting a follow‐up study over several years, the consistent use of equipment and personnel strengthens the comparison of our data. While we may not conclude definitively that our findings reflect the true evolution of functional capacity in isolated VSDs, they clearly suggest further deterioration of parameters with increasing age — an effect more pronounced in patients than in age‐matched healthy controls.

In the literature, only one long‐term follow‐up study including exercise testing on VSDs exists. In a Dutch follow‐up study from 2015, 69 patients with surgically corrected VSDs and a mean age of 40 years were followed at 10‐year intervals with exercise testing among other measurements. Median oxygen uptake was 87% of expected values compared with undocumented reference values. In this cohort, exercise capacity decreased from 100% of expected values in 1990 to 91% in 2001. In the most recent study in 2015, 48% of patients demonstrated decreased exercise capacity. Furthermore, cumulative survival in the cohort of patients with surgically closed VSDs was 86% at 40 years (excluding in‐hospital operative mortality), slightly lower than in the general population. Interestingly, in more than half of the cases, late mortality was observed.

### AHA/ACC vs ESC guidelines for management of adults with congenital heart disease: Jacc guideline comparison [^1159y4en]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology published practice guidelines for the management of adult congenital heart disease in 2018, while the European Society of Cardiology published analogous guidelines in 2020. Although there are broad areas of consensus between the two documents, there are important differences that impact patient management. This review discusses key areas of agreement and disagreement between the two guidelines, with a discussion of possible reasons for disagreement and potential implications.

### Comparison of outcomes in adults with ventricular septal defect closed earlier in life versus those in whom the defect was never closed [^114PiNcd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) have recently demonstrated poorer functional outcomes with disrupted ventricular contractility during exercise in young patients. It is not known whether this will change with age. Therefore, echocardiography was performed in older patients with congenital VSDs, either surgically closed or unrepaired, and all without Eisenmenger physiology, to compare functional outcomes with healthy peers. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed at rest and during supine bicycle exercise, with tissue velocity Doppler for assessment of primary endpoints: isovolumetric acceleration and systolic velocities.

In total, 30 surgically closed VSDs (51 ± 8 years) with 30 healthy controls (52 ± 9 years) and 30 unrepaired VSDs (55 ± 12 years) with 30 matched controls (55 ± 10 years) were included. Surgical patients displayed lower right ventricular (RV) systolic and early diastolic-filling velocities compared with controls, p < 0.01, lower tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (17.8 ± 5 vs. 22.7 ± 3 mm, p < 0.01), and lower fractional area change (37.8 ± 6 vs. 46.4% ± 7%, p < 0.01). Unrepaired VSDs also had lower RV fractional area change than matched controls (39.9 ± 7 vs. 48.4% ± 7%, p < 0.01). Both patient groups had more tricuspid regurgitation and larger RV outflow tract dimensions than controls, p < 0.01. During exercise, isovolumetric acceleration and systolic velocities were lower in both patient groups compared with controls, with the difference increasing with workload level.

In conclusion, adults in their mid-50s with surgically closed or unrepaired VSDs have diminished functional outcomes compared to their healthy peers.

### Subspecialty surveillance of long-term course of small and moderate muscular ventricular septal defect: Heterogenous practices, low yield [^112hViDG]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Descriptive statistics for categorical variables are reported as frequency and percentage. Univariate comparisons of outcome were made among dichotomous variables using the Chi-square test. Candidate independent variables were selected based on univariate correlation (p < 0.15) and were incorporated into a multivariate logistic regression to generate a model associating them with follow-up recommendations. Alpha to enter and alpha to exclude variables from the stepwise process were both set at 0.15. A p-value of < 0.05 represented significance. Statistical analysis was performed with commercially available computer software (Minitab 16.0, Minitab Inc, State College, PA).

### Long-term outcome of patients with ventricular septal defect considered not to require surgical closure during childhood [^1165oJpD]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of the study was to assess the long-term outcome of patients with small ventricular septal defects (VSDs) considered not to require surgical closure during childhood.

Although patients with small VSDs have generally been considered not to require surgery, more recent data suggest that a significant percentage of these patients develop serious problems during adult life.

A total of 229 consecutive patients (115 females) with a VSD considered too small to require surgery during childhood, as defined by normal pulmonary artery pressure, less than 50% shunt, pulmonary vascular resistance ≤ 200 dynes × s cm⁻⁵, no VSD-related aortic regurgitation (AR), and no symptoms, and who had no additional hemodynamically relevant heart defect, were followed in an adult congenital heart disease program. Physical examination, electrocardiography, and echocardiography were performed in all patients at one- to three-year intervals; exercise tests and Holter monitoring were performed in 140 and 127 patients, respectively.

Follow-up was completed in 222 patients (97%). The mean age at the last visit was 30 ± 10 years. Spontaneous VSD closure was observed in 14 patients (6%). No patients died, four patients (1.8%) had an episode of endocarditis — of whom two required aortic valve replacement — and one additional patient (0.4%) had surgical closure for hemodynamic reasons. For 118 patients who entered the study between 1993 and 1996 and were prospectively followed for 7.4 ± 1.2 years, event-free survival with endpoints defined as death, endocarditis, or surgery was observed.

### Ventricular septal defect [^113wsiTQ]. Lancet (2011). Low credibility.

Ventricular septal defects account for up to 40% of all congenital cardiac malformations. The diagnosis encompasses a broad range of anomalies, including isolated defects and those associated with other congenital cardiac malformations. Presentation, symptoms, natural history, and management of ventricular septal defects depend on the size and anatomical associations of the anomaly, the patient's age, and local diagnostic and interventional expertise.

In this seminar, we describe the anatomical range of ventricular septal defects and discuss the present management of these malformations. Genetic determinants, diagnostic techniques, physiological considerations, and management challenges are examined in detail. Unfortunately, in many circumstances, evidence on which to guide optimum management is scarce. We present some longer-term considerations of ventricular septal defects in adolescents and adults, with particular emphasis on patients with raised pulmonary vascular resistance and Eisenmenger's syndrome.

### Prevalence and development of additional cardiac abnormalities in 1448 patients with congenital ventricular septal defects [^116uftT8]. Heart (2004). Low credibility.

To determine by modern echocardiographic techniques the prevalence and development of cardiac abnormalities associated with ventricular septal defect (VSD), we conducted a study involving consecutive patients referred to a tertiary center for pediatric cardiology and attenders at an adult congenital heart disease clinic. Details of clinical outcomes were prospectively recorded. Patients with VSD in association with conotruncal abnormalities, atrioventricular septal defects, and univentricular heart were not included in the study.

A total of 1448 patients with VSD were assessed between 1991 and 1998. Among these, 1127 (78%) had isolated defects; of the isolated cases, 862 (76%) were perimembranous and 265 (24%) were muscular. Of the remaining population, 284 patients (19.6% of the total) had VSD associated with one other significant cardiac abnormality, 35 patients (2.4%) had two, and two patients (0.1%) had three other abnormalities. The most common associated cardiac abnormalities were infundibular pulmonary stenosis (5.8%), aortic valve prolapse (3.6%), pulmonary valvar stenosis (2.7%), osteum secundum atrial septal defect (2.2%), persistent ductus arteriosus (1.9%), and coarctation of the aorta (1.5%).

In the cohort of 743 patients followed up from birth, cumulative mortality was 4% by the age of 8 years, with most deaths occurring within the first year of life in infants with associated genetic abnormalities such as trisomy 13 or 18. In the subgroup of 594 patients attending the adult congenital clinic with VSD, aortic regurgitation due to aortic root prolapse developed in 45 (7.6%) patients. Most of these cases were detected before full clinical development.

### Intermediate-term clinical outcomes of primary biventricular repair for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and ventricular septal defect [^111JF4DS]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Primary biventricular repair for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and ventricular septal defect remains challenging. The intermediate-term outcomes and risk factors for mortality remain undefined.

- **Methods**: All patients undergoing primary biventricular repair of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and ventricular septal defect from 1995 to 2008 at the C. S. Mott Children's Hospital, University of Michigan Health Systems were analyzed.

- **Results**: Thirty-one patients (mean age, 18 days; 20 male) with a median follow-up of 6.7 years (range, 0.3–13.5 years) were identified. The ventricular septal defect was enlarged in 15 patients, and a limited atrial septal defect was constructed in 16 patients. There were 6 hospital and 2 late deaths. Ten-year patient survival was 72.3%. Lower body weight (P = 0.040), complete atrial septal defect closure (P = 0.026), and longer cardiopulmonary bypass time (P = 0.026) were risk factors of hospital mortality. An atrial septal defect was patent in 16 patients at discharge, 2 of whom required later surgical closure. Relief of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction was performed in 1 patient. No patient required pacemaker implantation. Five-year freedom from right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduit replacement was 39.3%. Smaller-sized conduit (P = 0.020) and use of aortic allograft (P = 0.048) were risk factors for early failure.

- **Conclusion**: Primary biventricular repair for patients with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and ventricular septal defect provides good early and intermediate-term outcomes.

### Atrial septal defect: Spectrum of care [^114yzeB6]. Pediatric Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a common congenital heart defect, and variability in its management exists among clinicians. A review of the literature reveals a lack of standard guidelines for the evaluation and management of patients with different types of ASDs. This survey-based study was conducted to test the uniformity of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to managing children with secundum, sinus venosus, and primum ASDs.

Survey questionnaires included questions regarding follow-up, diagnosis, and therapeutic intervention for different types and sizes of ASDs. The questions addressed follow-up visitations, type and frequency of investigative studies, pharmacological therapy, and choice of repair method. Surveys were sent to all pediatric cardiology academic programs in the United States (n = 48) and randomly selected international programs from Europe, Asia, and Australia (n = 19). A total of 23 programs (34%) responded to the survey, comprising 15 from the United States and 8 internationally.

A separate questionnaire was prepared for secundum, primum, and sinus venosus ASDs. In each questionnaire, lesion types were subdivided into small, moderate, and large defect sizes to address differences in management approaches for each defect type and size. Results indicate that in secundum ASD, most participants use the size of the defect and/or evidence of right-sided volume overload as criteria for defining small, moderate, and large defects. The frequency of follow-up does not vary with the type of lesion but is more frequent with larger defects. Most partic…

### Prediction of spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defect and guidance for clinical follow-up [^117Ko4yi]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

- **Results**: Evaluation of 127 children with isolated VSD by echocardiography showed that the frequency of p-VSD was more common (74 cases, 58%) than m-VSD (53 cases, 42%). These children (66 boys and 61 girls), aged 17 days to 48 months (mean 7.99 ± 8.52 months), were followed from 4 months to 74 months (mean 35.20 ± 19.92 months). Spontaneous closure occurred in 76 patients (60%).

- **P-ventricular septal defect**: The spontaneous closure rate in patients with p-VSD was 57% (Figure 1). Males had a better closure rate (62%) compared with females (51%). By the number of defects, spontaneous closure rates were as follows: single, 39 of 69 (57%); multiple, 3 of 5 (60%). Patients under 6 months of age at initial diagnosis showed a higher closure rate (69%) than those older than 6 months (45%). There was a negative association between defect size and the rate of spontaneous closure; small defects had the highest rate (83%). ATVMS was a favorable factor for spontaneous closure, with a rate of 70% with ATVMS compared to 24% without. PH was a negative factor for spontaneous closure. Although there were only five patients with PH in this study, none had closure. LVDD of spontaneous closure was smaller than no closure. Differences between patients with and without spontaneous closure of p-VSD are summarized in Table 1.

### Prediction of spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defect and guidance for clinical follow-up [^1131hm3L]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Whether the position of m-VSD affects the probability potential for spontaneous closure remains debatable. The results of this study indicated that the spontaneous closure of m-VSD is independent of the position of the defect, which is in line with published reports. We observed that the incidence rate of mid-muscular VSD, which is the most common position for m-VSD, was 60% with a spontaneous closure rate of 66%.

The spontaneous closure rate of apical defects was 67%, higher than the mid-muscular VSD and the apical VSD. This is contrary to previous reports which showed that apical VSD and anterior VSD persisted longer than mid-muscular VSD. Possible reasons for this disparity are differences in follow-up time, diagnostic criteria, and ethnicity.

### Early ventricular septal defect closure prevents the progression of aortic regurgitation: A long-term follow-up study [^111Bws6i]. Pediatric Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

According to short-term evidence, ventricular septal defect (VSD) closure should be performed as early as possible after aortic regurgitation (AR) diagnosis in pediatric patients to prevent AR progression. However, long-term follow-up data are lacking. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the long-term follow-up (≥ 10 years) of patients who underwent VSD closure as early as possible after AR diagnosis and to evaluate whether early VSD closure prevents progression of AR.

This was a retrospective cohort study of 42 patients with VSD and AR who had undergone VSD closure at a median age of 2.9 years, with a median waiting period from AR diagnosis to VSD closure of 3.4 months and follow-up of a median 13.1 years (interquartile range 10.0–15.8 years). The preoperative degree of AR was trivial in 25 patients, mild in 15, and moderate in 2. Of the 33 patients followed up for ≥ 10 years, none required aortic valve replacement, and there was no incidence of mortality. The degree of AR improved or did not change, except in 1 patient.

The size of the VSD (odds ratio [OR] 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62–1.18; p = 0.33), time from diagnosis to surgery (OR 1.00; 95% CI 1.000–1.001; p = 0.657), and age at the time of surgery (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.998–1.004; p = 0.452) were not predictive of persistent postoperative AR. Therefore, VSD closure performed as early as possible after AR diagnosis could successfully prevent AR progression in patients with less than moderate preoperative AR, eliminating the need for aortic valve replacement and valvuloplasty.

### Implementation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2008 guidelines for the management of adults with congenital heart disease [^116yRT9C]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Although different guidelines on adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) care advocate for lifetime cardiac follow-up, a critical appraisal of the guideline implementation is lacking. We investigated the implementation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2008 guidelines for ACHD follow-up by examining the type of health care professional, care setting, and frequency of outpatient visits in young adults with CHD. Furthermore, correlates for care in line with the recommendations or untraceability were investigated.

A cross-sectional observational study was conducted, including 306 patients with CHD who had a documented outpatient visit at pediatric cardiology before age 18 years. In all, 210 patients (68.6%) were in cardiac follow-up; 20 (6.5%) withdrew from follow-up, and 76 (24.9%) were untraceable. Overall, 198 patients were followed up in tertiary care, 1/4 (n = 52) of which were seen at a formalized ACHD care program and 3/4 (n = 146) remained at pediatric cardiology. Of those followed in formalized ACHD and pediatric cardiology care, the recommended frequency was implemented in 94.2% and 89%, respectively (p = 0.412).

No predictors for the implementation of the guidelines were identified. Risk factors for becoming untraceable included having none or a lower number of heart surgeries, health insurance issues, and nonwhite ethnicity. In conclusion, a significant number of adults continue to be cared for by pediatric cardiologists, indicating that transfer to adult-oriented care was not standard practice. The frequency of follow-up for most patients was aligned with the guidelines.

### Can left atrioventricular valve reduction index (LAVRI) predict the surgical strategy for repair of atrioventricular septal defect [^112WjawL]. Pediatric Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

There are several limitations to this study. This is a retrospective, single-center study with a small patient cohort. Further studies, preferably with a larger patient cohort and in a multi-center setting, are needed to evaluate the suitability of LAVRI in defining surgical strategy. The number of patients with unbalanced AVSD receiving BVR in our study is small; results of morbidity and mortality after BVR might change in a larger patient cohort. The skewed distribution of patients receiving UVP and BVR might confound the capacity of echocardiographic indices in defining surgical strategy. Additionally, no ventricular growth strategies were performed in our institution. Therefore, decision-making for BVR in unbalanced AVSD was performed based on preoperatively preexistent anatomic features without consideration of possible growth potential. Furthermore, MRI analysis and measurement of ventricular end-diastolic volumes were not performed in this study, which is only based on echocardiographic evaluation of ventricular size and AV valve disproportion.

### Prediction of spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defect and guidance for clinical follow-up [^116hS9w3]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

**Study population**: Between January 2008 and December 2016, 132 children presented with isolated ventricular septal defect (VSD) at Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University by echocardiography. Out of these 132, 127 patients — 66 males and 61 females with an average age of 7.99 ± 8.52 months — were diagnosed either with perimembranous ventricular septal defect (p-VSD) or muscular ventricular septal defect (m-VSD). Five children were excluded from the study during the follow-up period due to surgical intervention, including four with p-VSD and one with m-VSD. This study did not include patients with inlet and outlet VSD because most of these patients were recommended for early surgical treatment rather than follow-up observation. All participating children underwent echocardiography yearly until the closure of VSD or until they were 6 years old. All parents and guardians provided written informed consent for the minors to participate in this study. The school ethics committee approved the study.

### Functional capacity past age 40 in patients with congenital ventricular septal defects [^116NQ2K5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

In total, 391 patients aged > 40 years with a congenital ventricular septal defect (VSD) were identified through a search by diagnosis code. Of these, 74 patients with surgically closed VSDs and 67 patients with small unrepaired VSDs were eligible for inclusion, as shown in Figure 1. From September 2018 to August 2019, 30 patients with surgically closed VSDs, along with 30 healthy matched control participants, and 30 patients with small unrepaired VSDs, along with 30 healthy matched control participants, were included at Aarhus University Hospital. Patient groups and their respectively matched control groups displayed similar demographics, as presented in Table 1. There were no sex‐ or ethnicity‐based differences. However, cardiovascular comorbidities were more prevalent in patients than in controls. Regarding comorbidities of patients with surgically closed VSDs, 5 patients presented with arrhythmias and 8 had hypertension, in contrast with hypertension in 4 control participants. Among patients with unrepaired VSDs, 9 had hypertension, 1 had diabetes mellitus, 1 had a stroke, 1 had retinal artery occlusion, and 4 had arrhythmia, compared to hypertension in 6 control participants.

- **Cardiac arrhythmias**: Different types of arrhythmias were observed. In the surgically closed VSD group, 4 patients had atrial fibrillation and 1 had sick sinus syndrome; additionally, 1 had first-degree atrioventricular block, and 2 had multifocal ventricular extrasystole. In the group with unrepaired VSDs, 3 patients had atrial fibrillation and 1 had atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia. Furthermore, 1 patient had first-degree atrioventricular block, and 3 experienced supraventricular extrasystole.

### The unnatural history of an atrial septal defect: Longitudinal 35 year follow up after surgical closure at young age [^117Kzr3c]. Heart (2013). Low credibility.

To describe the very long-term outcome after surgical closure of an atrial septal defect (ASD), a longitudinal cohort study was conducted involving 135 consecutive patients who underwent surgical ASD repair at age less than 15 years between 1968 and 1980. The study protocol included ECG, echocardiography, exercise testing, N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic hormone, Holter monitoring, and cardiac MRI.

- **Main outcome measures**: Survival, major events (cardiac reinterventions, stroke, symptomatic arrhythmia or heart failure), and ventricular function.

- **Results**: After 35 years (range 30–41), survival status was obtained in 131 of 135 patients (97%); five died (4%), including two sudden deaths in the last decade. Fourteen patients (16%) experienced symptomatic supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and six (6%) had a pacemaker implanted, which was predicted by early postoperative arrhythmias. Two reoperations were performed. One ischaemic stroke occurred. Left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) ejection fractions (EF) were 58 ± 7% and 51 ± 6%, respectively. Right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) was diminished in 17 patients (31%), and in 11 (20%) the RV was dilated. Exercise capacity and quality of life were comparable to the normal population. No clear differences were found between ASD-II or sinus venosus type ASD.

- **Conclusions**: Very long-term outcome after surgical ASD closure in childhood shows good survival and low morbidity. Early surgical closure prevents pulmonary hypertension and reduces the occurrence of supraventricular arrhythmias. Early postoperative arrhythmias are predictive for the need for pacemaker implant.

### What is blocking transcatheter ventricular septal defect closure [^112LCSKr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are among the most common congenital heart defects, with an incidence rate of 3 to 3.5 per 1,000 live births. VSDs range in size from tiny pinholes to the near absence of the ventricular septum. Perimembranous VSDs (pmVSDs) account for 80% of VSDs, involving the membranous septum. The membranous septum is adjacent to the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve on its right ventricular aspect and to the aortic valve on its left ventricular aspect, while its inferoposterior margin closely relates to the bundle of His and bundle branches.

Spontaneous VSD closure is common, but invasive closure is indicated in a subset. Although surgery has long been the standard approach, transcatheter options have been available for decades. The first human experience of transcatheter closure of muscular VSDs was reported in 1988 by Lock et al. Investigators have since explored various approaches and devices for transcatheter device VSD closure, with widely varying rates of success and risk of complications. With improvements in device technology and techniques, transcatheter VSD closure is increasingly appealing, given the associated shorter hospital stay and faster recovery. Despite this, the US Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve any device for the indication of transcatheter closure of a pmVSD.

### Long-term outcomes of surgical repair for ventricular septal defect in adults [^112m4fq1]. Pediatric Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

Data on the outcomes of ventricular septal defect (VSD) closure in adults are limited to establish recommendations. Therefore, we reviewed our experience with surgical VSD closure in adult patients. We retrospectively analyzed 152 patients who underwent surgical VSD closure between January 1996 and April 2020. The median age of the patients was 30.5 years [interquartile range (IQR) 23.1–42.7 years], and the median follow-up duration was 10.9 years (IQR 4.8–16.1 years).

VSDs were classified according to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons classification as follows: type 2 (n = 66, 43.4%), type 1 (n = 59, 38.8%), and type 4 (n = 27, 17.8%). Aortic cusp prolapse (n = 86, 56.6%) and aortic valve regurgitation (AR, n = 75, 49.3%) were the most common indications for surgical closure. Four patients (2.6%) underwent late reoperation due to AR, infective endocarditis, and residual VSD. In the log-rank test, preoperative trivial or greater degree of AR (P = 0.004) and coronary cusp deformity (P = 0.031) were associated with late moderate or greater degree of AR. Preoperative moderate or greater AR was associated with reoperation (P = 0.047).

Concomitant aortic valve (AV) repair at the time of VSD closure was a significant risk factor for late significant AR progression in the multivariable analysis. VSD closure in adults can be performed with low mortality and morbidity rates. However, AR can progress after VSD closure because the aortic cusp may suffer irreversible damage from long-standing shunt flow exposure. We conclude that VSD with AV deformity or AR in adults should be treated aggressively before the disease progresses irreversibly.

### Subspecialty surveillance of long-term course of small and moderate muscular ventricular septal defect: Heterogeneous practices, low yield [^111rpPJv]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

**Patient characteristics**: After the exclusion of four patients with large muscular ventricular septal defects (mVSD), the study population consisted of 600 patients with mVSD. None of the patients had a swiss cheese septum. There were 262 males (43.7%) and 338 females (56.3%). The mean age at diagnosis was 15.9 months (ranging from 0 to 18.5 years), and the mean age at the last follow-up was 25.7 months (ranging from 0 to 18.5 years). Initial echocardiography showed isolated small mVSD in 509 patients (85%), multiple small mVSD in 60 patients (10%), isolated small-to-moderate mVSD in 12 patients (2%), and isolated moderate mVSD in 19 patients (3%).

### Subspecialty surveillance of long-term course of small and moderate muscular ventricular septal defect: Heterogenous practices, low yield [^115rD6tf]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

No clear consensus exists about the value of follow-up for small mVSD. Of 52 respondents to a small survey conducted among pediatric cardiology providers in the UK, the majority would follow up a hemodynamically insignificant VSD in three years, 15% would do so in one year, and less than 10% would dismiss the patient upon diagnosis. Our experience confirmed the striking variability in actual practice that the survey would lead us to expect. In this report, individual providers recommended pediatric cardiology follow-up for as few as 11% and as many as 100% of their patients.

Small mVSD are common. Studies prior to the routine use of echocardiography determined an incidence of 1.3–3.3 VSD per 1,000 live births, but with the advent of echocardiography, incidence has increased significantly. Because the population of children with small mVSD is large, a policy of routine pediatric cardiology follow-up would consume substantial resources in the subspecialty outpatient clinic. The benefits of this investment are not obvious; given the natural history studies that show uncomplicated small mVSD carries a high likelihood of spontaneous closure, and little if any prospect for clinical deterioration. It is impressive that the provider with the largest practice had the lowest follow-up rate of 11%, while providers with the smaller clinical practice had the higher rates. This would suggest that provider experience might be associated with better resource utilization, perhaps driven by greater confidence.

Our data confirms that among a large number of pediatric cardio…

### Lifetime burden of morbidity in patients with isolated congenital ventricular septal defect [^116jCRZi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Patients with a congenital isolated ventricular septal defect (VSD), whether unrepaired or surgically closed, displayed a substantial burden of arrhythmias, infectious endocarditis, heart failure, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. For patients with an unrepaired defect, the incidence of morbidity was trivial before their fourth decade of life; however, it was amplified significantly thereafter. Patients with a surgically closed defect present with significant morbidity earlier, after the second decade of life, and survival free from events is clearly inferior compared to both unrepaired patients and controls from the general population. This difference persists even when morbidity from birth until the first year after surgery is censored.

Our data support the latest recommendations on regular follow-up for patients with VSD and highlight the potential development of significant cardiac morbidity after the fourth decade of life in patients with unrepaired VSD and after the third decade of life in patients with surgically closed VSD. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying these significant burdens of mortality and morbidity are an area of unmet research need that may have a transformational impact for patients in the future.

### Clinical course of residual ventricular septal defects after congenital heart disease repair [^1119BGTo]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Low credibility.

The clinical course of residual ventricular septal defects after congenital heart disease repair is not completely elucidated in the medical literature. This study assessed the incidence, size, and clinical course of residual defects. This single-center retrospective study included 132 patients who survived after ventricular septal defect patch closure (n = 107) and intracardiac repair of double-outlet right ventricle (n = 16) and tetralogy of Fallot (n = 9). Residual defects were evaluated on transthoracic echocardiogram upon hospital discharge and at outpatient clinic visits. The median age at surgery was 1.2 years (range, 0.3–13.9 years). In total, 45 (34.1%) patients presented with residual defects upon hospital discharge. The residual defects were within 2 mm (n = 27), 2–3 mm (n = 15), and greater than 3 mm (n = 3), with a median size of 1.5 mm (range, 0.5–3.8 mm). There was no late mortality during a median follow-up of 5.4 years. Among 42 patients, residual defects measuring 3 mm upon hospital discharge increased, and two patients required re-surgery for a residual defect. Significant residual defects requiring reoperation were rare. In most cases, residual defects measuring less than 3 mm upon hospital discharge spontaneously closed within 5 years, and the size of the other defects decreased.

### Lifetime burden of morbidity in patients with isolated congenital ventricular septal defect [^113QYec1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Infants with a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) can present with heart failure. Otherwise, heart failure in childhood is a rare condition in patients with isolated VSD. Nonetheless, abnormal left ventricle dimensions and systolic and diastolic left ventricle dysfunction have been demonstrated in surgically closed, and even restrictive unrepaired, VSDs in patients in their early 40s. Furthermore, almost 20% of patients with small unrepaired VSDs aged over 40 years developed heart failure in a report of more than 700 patients in a French study reported in 1977; 28% of patients with closed VSDs needed medication for heart failure 30 years after surgical repair in a recently reported study of congenital heart disease outcomes in Finnish patients. Our data revealed a considerable incidence of heart failure in both patients with unrepaired defects and in those with surgically closed defects, accelerating after the fourth or fifth decade of life. Dissecting the data, it is obvious that patients with VSD carry a risk of heart failure not only around the time of VSD diagnosis or surgery but also many years later. Several hypotheses have been postulated as to the underlying pathogenesis, including an inappropriate adaptation to the hemodynamics with age, a consequence of acquired cardiac morbidities, such as aortic or mitral valve regurgitation, or a consequence of chronic pressure and volume overload, leading to disturbed systolic function. Left ventricular disease as part of a diffuse cardiovascular disease unrelated to the actual defect or an associated cardiomyopathy has also been proposed, which hypothetically could explain these findings.

### Lifetime burden of morbidity in patients with isolated congenital ventricular septal defect [^1144bAN7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

The lifetime burden of morbidity in patients with isolated congenital ventricular septal defect (VSD) is not completely described. In a population-based cohort study in Denmark using nationwide medical registries, we included 8,006 patients diagnosed with a congenital VSD before 2018 along with 79,568 randomly selected controls from the general Danish population matched by birth year and sex. Concomitant congenital cardiac malformations and chromosomal abnormalities were excluded.

- **Methods and results**:
	- Cox proportional hazard regression, Fine and Gray competing risk regression, and Kaplan-Meier survival function were used to estimate the burden of morbidity compared with matched controls. Median follow-up was 23 years (interquartile range, 11–37 years). The hazard ratio (HR) of heart failure was high in both patients with unrepaired and surgically closed VSD when compared with their corresponding matched controls (5.4 [95% CI, 4.6–6.3] and 30.5 [95% CI, 21.8–42.7], respectively).
	- Truncated analyses with time from birth until 1 year after VSD diagnosis (unrepaired) or surgery (surgically closed) censored revealed reduced but persisting late hazard of heart failure. Similarly, the late hazard of arrhythmias and pulmonary arterial hypertension was high irrespective of defect closure. The HR of endocarditis was 28.0 (95% CI, 19.2–40.9) in patients with unrepaired defect and 82.7 (95% CI, 37.5–183.2) in patients with surgically closed defect. The increased HR diminished after VSD surgery.

In general, the incidence of morbidity among patients with unrepaired VSD accelerated after diagnosis.

### Prediction of spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defect and guidance for clinical follow-up [^116woCLA]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

It is well known that spontaneous closure of VSD can occur at any age, but it most commonly occurs in childhood. According to the statistics, the mean age of closure of p-VSD was 28.88 ± 15.95 months (median 24.50 months), and the mean age of closure of m-VSD was 28.61 ± 20.14 months (median 26.20 months), indicating that spontaneous closure occurred mainly in the first three years. In a study by Yang et al, spontaneous closure of VSD in the first three years accounted for 78.50% of all spontaneous closure events, which decreased dramatically after four years of age.

Clinical management of isolated VSD is imperative because the long-term persistence of defects may lead to complications. Complications such as infective endocarditis, LV volume overload, double-chambered right ventricle, and arrhythmia may develop over time. Appropriate follow-up of patients with VSD may assist pediatricians in understanding patients' conditions and disease progression. Convenient and efficient echocardiography is used to measure the predictors of the spontaneous closure of VSD. It is helpful for pediatricians to assess the spontaneous closure of VSD and reduce parental anxiety. This can also help pediatricians detect complications promptly and treat children with adverse conditions timely to improve the prognosis of patients.

Our model demonstrated good discriminatory ability. The areas under the curve for predicting p-VSD and m-VSD were 0.854 and 0.898, respectively. Based on the findings of this study, we recommend follow-up criteria for patients with isolated VSD.

### The unnatural history of the ventricular septal defect: Outcome up to 40 years after surgical closure [^115T3FWD]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Few prospective data are available regarding long-term outcomes after the surgical closure of a ventricular septal defect (VSD). The objective of this study was to investigate clinical outcomes more than 30 years after surgical VSD closure.

Patients who underwent surgical VSD closure during childhood between 1968 and 1980 were reexamined every 10 years. In 2012, eligible patients were invited to undergo another examination, which included electrocardiography, Holter monitoring, echocardiography, bicycle ergometry, measurement of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and subjective health assessment.

Cumulative survival was 86% at 40 years. Causes of mortality included arrhythmia, heart failure, endocarditis, valvular surgery, pulmonary hypertension, noncardiac causes, and unknown causes. Cumulative event-free survival after surgery was 72% at 40 years. Symptomatic arrhythmias occurred in 13% of patients, and surgical or catheter-based reinterventions were needed in 12% of cases. The prevalence of impaired right ventricular systolic function increased from 1% in 2001 to 17% in 2012 (p = 0.001). Left ventricular systolic function was impaired but stable in 21% of patients. Aortic regurgitation occurred more frequently in the last 20 years (p = 0.039), and mean exercise capacity decreased (p = 0.003). N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels (median: 11.6 pmol/l [interquartile range: 7.0 to 19.8 pmol/l]) were elevated (> 14 pmol/l) in 38% of patients. A concomitant cardiac lesion, such as a patent ductus arteriosus, and aortic cross-clamp time were determinants of late events.

A case report discusses a 28-year-old patient who presented with symptoms and signs of congestive heart failure, along with clinical signs of a ventricular septal defect. Further evaluation with an echocardiogram revealed non-compaction of the left ventricle, severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and a ventricular septal defect. The patient was treated with standard heart failure therapy and is currently doing well.

### Prediction of spontaneous closure of isolated ventricular septal defects in utero and postnatal life [^1176fY4q]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The incidence of congenital heart disease (CHD) in the western world is 0.3–1.2% of live births. Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most common congenital heart defect, accounting for 20–30% of all congenital heart defects. In a recent study, Zhao et al. described a 2.66% prevalence of CHD at live birth in China using echocardiographic screening. They also found a 1.21% prevalence of CHD detectable by clinical evaluation, with VSD as the most common CHD at a prevalence of 1.73%. VSDs can occur alone or in combination with other cardiac defects. However, the majority of VSDs occur alone and are referred to as "isolated" or "simple". This study, therefore, focused on isolated VSDs. VSDs are typically asymptomatic and often close spontaneously. Two-dimensional echocardiography combined with pulsed Doppler or Doppler color flow mapping is a well-established technique to diagnose and localize fetal and infant VSDs. The present study utilized fetal echocardiography and state at birth to evaluate the incidence and timing of spontaneous closure (SC) of VSD in patients who were diagnosed with VSD prenatally in eastern China. There have been a number of observational long-term follow-up studies on SC of VSD, but few of these reports followed up from the fetal period. Here, we present a long-term follow-up study in which subjects were followed from the fetal period and summarize a prediction formula including factors influencing SC of VSD. We found that birth weight was a prognostic variable for SC of VSD.

### Cause-specific mortality of patients with atrial septal defect and up to 50 years of follow-up [^114vavFw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Patients with ASD had higher overall mortality, with an adjusted mortality risk ratio (MRR) of 1.72 (95% CI, 1.61–1.83). MRRs were 1.79 (95% CI, 1.65–1.94) for female patients and 1.64 (95% CI, 1.48–1.81) for male patients. Female patients with ASD had lower mortality compared with male counterparts (MRR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.59–0.74]), a difference also observed in the control population (MRR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.58–0.65]).

Patients with closed ASDs had higher total mortality (MRR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.10–1.51]). No difference in mortality was detected if the defect was closed before the age of 30 (MRR, 1.58 [95% CI, 0.90–2.77]). In surgically closed defects, the MRR was 1.49 (95% CI, 1.26–1.76).

- **Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality**:
	- Mortality risk ratios are adjusted to sex, age, year at the start of follow-up, and age at the beginning of follow-up. ASD indicates atrial septal defect, and TC refers to transcatheter.

- **Long-term mortality according to study groups**:
	- **Total mortality**
	- **Cardiovascular mortality**
	- **Mortality of closed atrial septal defects compared with the control population**
	- **Mortality of transcatheter and surgically closed patients**

Only individualized controls were included in the analysis.

### Subspecialty surveillance of long-term course of small and moderate muscular ventricular septal defect: Heterogeneous practices, low yield [^116kBbqQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

In all, 316 follow-up visits were recommended by fourteen pediatric cardiology providers, of which 259 were actually accomplished. There were 37 other unplanned follow-up visits. No recommendations for medical or surgical management were made at any of the follow-up visits. The mean follow-up duration was 1.4 years (range 1 month to 5 years). For those patients who were dismissed from follow-up, the mean interval from initial visit to dismissal was 0.82 years (range 0 days to 12.3 years). There were 12 MD (evaluated 85% of small mVSDs) and 2 non-MD physician assistant providers (evaluated 15% of small mVSDs).

Follow-up was recommended for patients with an isolated small mVSD at a rate of 32%, versus 68% for small-to-moderate and moderate isolated mVSD, and 58% for multiple small mVSD (p < 0.001, Table 1). Younger age at first visit was associated with a greater rate of recommendation for follow-up. The mean age at first visit for patients who were recommended follow-up was 11.4 months vs. 18.4 months for patients who were not recommended follow-up (p = 0.006).

There was significant variability in follow-up recommendations between providers, ranging from 11–100% (Table 2). Independent associations with the recommendation for follow-up were limited to high clinical volume provider, the mVSD characteristics (multiple mVSD, isolated small-to-moderate, or isolated moderate mVSD), and patient age under 3 months at first visit (Table 3). Patient gender, echo-reading provider, and non-MD provider did not appear to be independently related to subspecialty follow-up.

### Surgical repair of ventricular septal defect; contemporary results and risk factors for a complicated course [^112aFFGj]. Pediatric Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Surgical closure of the ventricular septal defect is the most commonly performed procedure in pediatric cardiac surgery. There are conflicting data on weight at the time of operation as a risk factor for a complicated course. We performed a retrospective evaluation of mortality and morbidity in all patients undergoing surgical ventricular septal defect closure at our institution between 2004 and 2012 to identify risk factors for a complicated course. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was performed to identify risk factors for a complicated course.

A total of 243 patients who underwent surgical ventricular septal defect closure were included. The median age at operation was 168.0 days (range 17–6898), and the median weight was 6.0 kg (range 2.1–102.0). No deaths occurred. Two patients (0.8%) required a pacemaker for permanent heart block. Five patients (2.1%) underwent reoperation for a hemodynamically important residual ventricular septal defect. No other major adverse events occurred. No risk factors for major adverse events could be established.

Multivariate analysis identified a genetic syndrome, long bypass time, and low weight at operation as independent risk factors for a prolonged intensive care stay (> 1 day) and prolonged ventilation time (> 6 hours). Contemporary results of surgical VSD closure are excellent, with no mortality and low morbidity in this series. Although it is associated with increased ventilation time and a longer hospital stay, low body weight at operation is not associated with an increased risk of complications or major adverse events in our series.

### Frequency of circumferential pericardial effusion by echocardiography in adults with foramen ovale type atrial septal defect versus ventricular septal defect [^116aPGP5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Many published reports have described pericardial effusions in patients with secundum atrial septal defects. This study investigated their associated prevalence echocardiographically using 40 patients with isolated ventricular septal defects as controls in an adult patient population. Pericardial effusions accompanied atrial septal defects in 13 patients and ventricular septal defects in only 3 patients (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, pericardial effusions are much more common (p < 0.005) with uncomplicated secundum atrial septal defects than with uncomplicated ventricular septal defects.

### Residual shunts following isolated surgical ventricular septal defect closure: Risk factors and spontaneous closure [^111JkENF]. Pediatric Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Although isolated congenital ventricular septal defects (VSD) can be repaired with a high degree of success, residual shunts (RS) are commonplace postoperatively. Small RS are relatively innocuous and tend to spontaneously close with time, despite the emotional burden they pose for the patient and family. A large RS, however, needs ongoing surveillance and may necessitate reintervention.

Factors influencing the incidence of RS, as well as the likelihood and expected timing of its spontaneous closure, are discussed in this study. The patient records and relevant data of 362 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac operation with isolated congenital VSD closure as the primary procedure between January 2017 and December 2017 were included in the study. Postoperative transthoracic echocardiograms were performed at hospital discharge and during follow-up at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively. Residual defects were measured under echocardiogram at every follow-up.

Factors expected to be associated with RS occurrence and spontaneous closure were included for logistic and Cox regression statistical analysis. There were 113 cases where RS occurred according to the first postoperative echocardiograms performed at discharge, of which 80 were confirmed closed during subsequent follow-up, with a median follow-up of 96 days. A cutoff of 1.25 mm for the initial RS was found to be the best predictor of spontaneous closure at a 6-month follow-up. Small shunts had a higher closure rate than larger ones by a follow-up duration of 300 days, at which the two groups tended to align in outcomes.

### Ventricular septal defects in adults [^115qzaNM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Because congenital ventricular septal defects can vary in size and location, their clinical presentation, natural history, and treatment options differ greatly. This review discusses the various types of ventricular septal defects commonly seen in adults, based on the authors' experience and existing literature. Ventricular septal defects can manifest as isolated small defects or larger defects associated with conditions such as pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary hypertension, or aortic regurgitation. These associations significantly impact the pathophysiologic consequences of the defect, its long-term complications, and the available treatment options. Understanding the different clinical presentations in adulthood and the features specific to these defects is crucial for the assessment and care of adult patients with this common congenital cardiac malformation.

### Prediction of spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defect and guidance for clinical follow-up [^1111t44b]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Although the high rate of spontaneous closure was satisfying, there was currently no simple and systematic way to predict spontaneous closure of VSD. Therefore, it was essential to identify predictors of spontaneous closure of VSD. According to our analysis, defect size, ATVMS, and LVDD were characteristic and representative predictors. Our study showed that defect size was one of the key factors affecting the spontaneous closure of VSD. For the same age of examination, the smaller the defect, the easier it is to close spontaneously. The spontaneous closure rate of small p-VSD was 83%, and small m-VSD was 80%. Our results are consistent with these studies in that the spontaneous closure probability of small defects was much higher than larger ones.

- **ATVMS formation**: ATVMS formation was also an important factor in the spontaneous closure of p-VSD. It was reported that the rate of ATVMS formation was 46% to 81%, and the large difference depended on the study population. In our study, ATVMS formation was detected in 72% of patients with p-VSD, and the rate of spontaneous closure was up to 70% in cases with ATVMS. Although the mechanism was still unclear, there were reports that ATVMS formation would limit left-to-right shunting and may result in partial or complete closure of VSD.

- **LVDD as a predictor**: LVDD was a negative predictor of spontaneous closure, with an unfavorable VSD prognosis. Our study showed that LVDD of spontaneous closure cases was smaller than those of no closure, indicating that left-to-right shunting was large and the ventricular volume overload resulted in left ventricular enlargement.

### Risk factors and long-term outcomes of tricuspid regurgitation after transcatheter closure of pediatric perimembranous ventricular septal defects [^1176p5p8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

After excluding 67 patients due to incomplete follow-up data, a total of 1,343 patients aged from 1 year 8 months to 18 years, with complete baseline and follow-up data and a median follow-up of 78 (range, 12–244) months, were included in this study cohort. The baseline patient characteristics and VSD-related measurements are detailed in Table 1, which has been omitted here for brevity.

- **Postprocedural results**: Postprocedural tricuspid regurgitation (TR) occurred in 163 patients (12.1%), comprising 143 new-onset cases and 20 cases with progression of preexisting regurgitation. Among the new-onset cases, 1 was severe, 15 were moderate, and the rest were mild. Of the 20 cases with aggravated regurgitation, 1 was severe, 5 were moderate, and 14 were mild. The majority of TR cases (137 out of 163) occurred within 1 day after the procedure, while the remaining 26 appeared during follow-up.

A notable case of severe postprocedural TR was observed in a 3-year-old girl without membranous aneurysms, who had preexisting mild TR. A 5-mm symmetrical VSD occluder was deployed successfully. Bedside TTE showed moderate TR both before and after the occluder release. On the first day post-procedure, TTE revealed enlargement of the right atrium and ventricle, severe TR, and dilation of the tricuspid annulus, with no abnormalities in the chordae tendineae. After 12 days of observation with no improvement, the patient underwent cardiac surgery for occluder removal, VSD repair, and tricuspid valve repair.

### Subspecialty surveillance of long-term course of small and moderate muscular ventricular septal defect: Heterogeneous practices, low yield [^114RvDh2]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

No expert consensus guides the practice for the intensity of ongoing pediatric cardiology surveillance of hemodynamically insignificant small and moderate muscular ventricular septal defect (mVSD). Therefore, despite the well-established benign natural history of mVSD, there is potential for widely divergent follow-up practices. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate: (1) variations in the follow-up of mVSD within an academic children's hospital-based pediatric cardiology practice, and (2) the frequency of active medical or surgical management resulting from follow-up of mVSD.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed records of 600 patients with isolated mVSD, echocardiographically diagnosed between 2006 and 2012. Large mVSD were excluded (n = 4). Patient age, gender, echocardiographic findings, provider, recommendations for follow-up, and medical and surgical management were tabulated at initial and follow-up visits. Independent associations with follow-up recommendations were sought using multivariate analysis.

- **Results**: Initial echocardiography showed a small single mVSD in 509 patients (85%), multiple small mVSD in 60 patients (10%), and small-to-moderate or moderate single mVSD in 31 patients (5%). The mean age at diagnosis was 15.9 months (range: 0–18.5 years) and 25.7 months (range: 0–18.5 years) at the last follow-up. There was a slight female predominance (56.3%). Fourteen pediatric cardiology providers recommended 316 follow-up visits, of which 259 were accomplished. There were an additional 37 unplanned follow-up visits. No medical or surgical management changes were associated with any of the follow-up visits.
