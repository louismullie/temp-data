## Question

Iv vitamin c

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about intravenous vitamin C, specifically its evidence, safety, dosing, and guideline positions across sepsis, COVID-19, cancer, and general critical illness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics and why IV dosing is mechanistically distinct. Then, I should appraise the highest-quality evidence in sepsis and septic shock, including LOVIT and harmonized COVID-19 RCTs. Next, I will review meta-analyses and reconcile conflicting signals. After that, I need to examine safety, especially oxalate nephropathy and glucose monitoring interference. Then, I should verify dosing strategies and special populations, including renal replacement therapy and pediatrics. Finally, I will align conclusions with guideline recommendations and outline practical, risk-stratified takeaways with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic rationale for IV vitamin C. Humans cannot synthesize vitamin C, and critical illness drives plasma levels down to deficiency or scorbutic ranges, where oral absorption is saturable and insufficient to replete stores; IV administration achieves 10–100-fold higher plasma concentrations and supports antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and endothelial effects that are dose-dependent and not attainable orally, which underpins its investigative use in sepsis and ARDS [^4006e483] [^3fedcb5b] [^05f6aafc].

> Now, I should review the highest-quality sepsis evidence. The LOVIT randomized, placebo-controlled trial in adults with sepsis on vasopressors found that high-dose IV vitamin C increased the risk of death or persistent organ dysfunction at 28 days, with a Bayesian reanalysis confirming a high probability of harm; importantly, baseline imbalances favored worse severity in the vitamin C arm, but sensitivity analyses still suggested harm, so I need to be cautious about attributing this solely to chance or confounding [^e99f2ed4] [^4454621e]. Wait, let me verify the dosing and context: LOVIT used 50 mg/kg every 6 hours for 96 hours, which is the same regimen studied in COVID-19 trials, and the harm signal persisted across prior assumptions, reinforcing concern in this population and dose range [^e99f2ed4] [^4454621e].

> Next, I should review COVID-19 data. The harmonized LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP trials, totaling over 2,500 patients, showed no benefit of IV vitamin C on organ support–free days or 28-day outcomes in critically ill or non-critically ill COVID-19, despite a modest reduction in intubation rates that did not translate into improved survival or persistent organ dysfunction; this argues against routine use in COVID-19 outside trials [^23cbab7f] [^91df123e] [^394e43d8]. Hold on, I should double-check the magnitude of the intubation signal: it was statistically significant but clinically small and not linked to hard outcomes, so it should not drive practice change [^23cbab7f] [^91df123e].

> I will now examine meta-analyses in sepsis to reconcile mixed signals. Several contemporary meta-analyses show that IV vitamin C shortens vasopressor duration and modestly improves SOFA score changes at 72–96 hours, but consistently fails to reduce short-term mortality overall; subgroup signals of mortality benefit at 25–100 mg/kg/day exist but are hypothesis-generating and not robust, and one meta-analysis reported more adverse events with vitamin C, which tempers enthusiasm [^9f2ab680] [^b15c0794] [^8e720c5f]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought some meta-analyses showed a mortality benefit, but on closer inspection those positive signals are inconsistent, often driven by small or high-risk-of-bias studies, and are not corroborated by large, rigorously controlled trials like LOVIT [^9f2ab680] [^b15c0794] [^e99f2ed4].

> Let me consider cancer separately, because the rationale and evidence differ. High-dose IV vitamin C can generate millimolar plasma concentrations that may exert pro-oxidant cytotoxicity in tumor microenvironments and has plausible mechanisms, but randomized trials have not demonstrated improved survival or tumor response, and current use remains investigational; palliative quality-of-life benefits have been reported in small studies, but these are not sufficient to recommend routine oncologic use outside trials [^0b36f63e] [^689f9461] [^9f52a06a]. I should confirm that oral vitamin C cannot replicate these pharmacokinetics; indeed, oral dosing is limited by saturable absorption and does not achieve the millimolar levels implicated in anticancer effects, which is why IV routes are used in research settings [^3fedcb5b].

> Next, I should review safety signals carefully. Although many RCTs report no excess serious adverse events, there are credible signals of harm in specific contexts: multiple retrospective cohorts link high-dose IV vitamin C with increased acute kidney injury and mortality in sepsis, likely via oxalate nephropathy, and case reports document oxalate-related renal failure even at lower chronic oral doses; additionally, high-dose ascorbate can interfere with certain glucose meters, causing falsely elevated readings and potentially unsafe insulin decisions [^c8cdfb31] [^f8c96ebc] [^5d0abd3a] [^69478109]. Hold on, I should verify the mechanism: vitamin C is metabolized to oxalate, and in the setting of high-dose exposure and renal handling, calcium oxalate crystals can precipitate and cause tubular injury, which aligns with observed AKI signals in septic cohorts [^5d0abd3a].

> I need to check dosing nuances and special populations. Pharmacokinetic studies in critical illness show that 2–3 g/day IV can normalize plasma concentrations, whereas 10 g/day yields supraphysiologic levels and increased oxalate excretion; in patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy, vitamin C is removed and some experts propose higher doses, but evidence is limited and not definitive, so I should caution against routine megadosing in CRRT without prospective data [^890e60b9] [^8e6b6030]. For pediatrics, guidelines recommend against routine IV vitamin C in septic shock due to very low-quality evidence, and available pediatric studies show no clear efficacy signal, though harm has not been consistently observed in small cohorts [^f210a43f] [^0189708a].

> Let me align with guidelines to ensure my conclusions are consistent with consensus. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends against routine IV vitamin C in adults with sepsis or septic shock, citing low-quality evidence and lack of mortality benefit; emergency medicine consensus similarly advises against adjunctive vitamin C in early sepsis, and pediatric sepsis guidelines likewise suggest against its use in children [^7fe6f050] [^1517a3f0] [^ba1b456b] [^f210a43f]. I should confirm that these recommendations explicitly note the weak strength and low certainty, reflecting the conflicting trial data and potential for harm in some contexts [^7fe6f050] [^1517a3f0].

> But wait, what if there is a time- or phenotype-dependent benefit we are missing? Biologic plausibility and small studies suggest early administration, adequate duration, and selection of patients with profound vasoplegia or microcirculatory failure could matter, yet large, well-conducted trials have not validated a mortality benefit, and the LOVIT harm signal argues against indiscriminate use; thus, any residual role, if it exists, should be confined to trials with careful risk stratification and monitoring [^e99f2ed4] [^0ca4e0e3] [^6c17a8f7]. I should double-check that ongoing and future studies are incorporating dose-finding, timing, and patient selection strategies to address these uncertainties before routine adoption is considered.

> Finally, I should translate this into practical clinical guidance. Outside of a clinical trial, routine IV vitamin C should not be used for sepsis, septic shock, or COVID-19 given neutral or harmful outcomes in large RCTs and guideline recommendations; if considered in a research or exceptional circumstance, use conservative dosing, avoid prolonged high-dose regimens, screen for kidney stone risk or G6PD deficiency, monitor renal function and oxalate when feasible, and be aware of glucose meter interference; for confirmed vitamin C deficiency, repletion doses of 200 mg to 2–3 g/day IV are reasonable, whereas pharmacologic megadoses should be avoided outside trials [^e99f2ed4] [^23cbab7f] [^14121788] [^69478109] [^890e60b9]. Hold on, I should verify that these precautions align with FDA labeling and safety communications; yes, warnings about oxalate risk, renal impairment, and G6PD-related hemolysis are reflected in labeling and safety reviews, supporting this cautious approach [^cac20824] [^a1f7aff3].

Intravenous vitamin C (IVVC) is **not routinely recommended** for critically ill patients, including those with sepsis, COVID-19, or cancer, because high-quality evidence shows **no consistent mortality benefit** and potential harm in some settings [^7fe6f050] [^23cbab7f] [^689f9461]. IVVC may modestly reduce vasopressor duration and improve some organ dysfunction markers, but these effects **do not translate into improved survival** [^9f2ab680] [^b15c0794]. Safety concerns include oxalate nephropathy, hypernatremia, and glucose meter interference, especially with high-dose or prolonged use [^cacfedc4] [^69478109]. Routine use is discouraged; if considered, limit to clinical trials or carefully selected cases with close monitoring.

---

## Clinical indications and evidence

### Sepsis and septic shock

- **Evidence summary**: Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show IVVC does not reduce mortality in sepsis or septic shock, despite earlier signals of benefit [^9f2ab680] [^b15c0794].
- **Key trials**: LOVIT showed harm (increased risk of death or persistent organ dysfunction) with high-dose IVVC (50 mg/kg every 6 hours) [^e99f2ed4] [^4454621e].
- **Guidelines**: Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends against routine IVVC in sepsis (weak, low-quality evidence) [^7fe6f050] [^1517a3f0].

---

### COVID-19

In COVID-19, **LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP** (1,569 patients) found no benefit of IVVC on organ support–free days or mortality, though a modest reduction in intubation was observed and is not sufficient to recommend use [^23cbab7f] [^91df123e]. A meta-analysis of 6 RCTs (572 patients) likewise found **no significant benefit** of vitamin C on mortality, ICU or hospital length of stay, or need for ventilation [^bcfd85a8].

---

### Cancer

In cancer, **no RCTs** demonstrate improved survival or tumor response with IVVC; evidence is limited to case reports and small uncontrolled studies, so routine oncologic use is not supported [^689f9461]. Potential mechanisms (e.g. oxidative stress induction) are under study, but **clinical validation is pending** [^0b36f63e].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and dosing

- **Pharmacokinetics**: IVVC achieves plasma concentrations 10–100× higher than oral dosing, enabling pharmacologic effects, but optimal dosing remains uncertain [^3fedcb5b] [^890e60b9].
- **Common regimens**: 1.5–6 g every 6 hours for 4–7 days; doses up to 50–100 mg/kg/day have been studied, with no clear dose-response for mortality [^b8e6ef95] [^8e720c5f].
- **Duration**: Most trials used 4–7 days; prolonged use increases oxalate risk [^890e60b9] [^5d0abd3a].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

- **Oxalate nephropathy**: Risk rises with high-dose or prolonged IVVC, particularly in renal impairment [^cacfedc4] [^5d0abd3a].
- **Hypernatremia**: Sodium load from ascorbate formulations can cause hypernatremia, especially with repeated dosing [^890e60b9].
- **Glucose monitoring**: High-dose IVVC can falsely elevate some glucose meters, risking insulin errors [^69478109].
- **Hemolysis**: G6PD deficiency increases risk of hemolysis with high-dose IVVC [^cacfedc4].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines **advise against routine IVVC** in sepsis, COVID-19, and cancer due to lack of benefit and potential harm; use should be restricted to trials or exceptional cases with informed consent and monitoring [^7fe6f050] [^23cbab7f] [^689f9461]. If used, **monitor renal function**, electrolytes, and glucose, and avoid prolonged high-dose therapy.

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Research priorities include **identifying subgroups** (e.g. severe vitamin C deficiency, ARDS) that may benefit, defining optimal dosing and duration, and clarifying safety in renal impairment and G6PD deficiency. Larger, multicenter RCTs with standardized protocols are needed to resolve these questions [^b8e6ef95].

---

Intravenous vitamin C is **not routinely recommended** for critically ill patients, including those with sepsis, COVID-19, or cancer, because benefits are inconsistent and safety concerns persist. Use should be limited to clinical trials or carefully selected cases with close monitoring.

### IV vitamin C in critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a0b1bb24]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of IV vitamin C on outcomes in critically ill patients.

Data Sources

Systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials testing IV vitamin C in critically ill patients.

Data Abstraction

Two independent reviewers abstracted patient characteristics, treatment details, and clinical outcomes.

Data Synthesis

Fifteen studies involving 2,490 patients were identified. Compared with placebo, IV vitamin C administration is associated with a trend toward reduced overall mortality (relative risk, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75–1.00; p = 0.06; test for heterogeneity I² = 6%). High-dose IV vitamin C was associated with a significant reduction in overall mortality (relative risk, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.52–0.96; p = 0.03), whereas low-dose IV vitamin C had no effect (relative risk, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.79–1.07; p = 0.46; test for subgroup differences, p = 0.14). IV vitamin C monotherapy was associated with a significant reduction in overall mortality (relative risk, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49–0.83; p = 0.006), whereas there was no effect with IV vitamin C combined therapy. No trial reported an increase in adverse events related to IV vitamin C.

Conclusions

IV vitamin C administration appears safe and may be associated with a trend toward reduction in overall mortality. High-dose IV vitamin C monotherapy may be associated with improved overall mortality, and further randomized controlled trials are warranted.

### Is there a role for oral or intravenous ascorbate (vitamin C) in treating patients with cancer? A systematic review [^689f9461]. The Oncologist (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Many cancer patients receive supplemental ascorbate (vitamin C) in the belief that it synergizes the anticancer effects of chemotherapy and reduces its toxicity.

Methods

A systematic review was performed to evaluate the antitumor effects and toxicity of ascorbate treatment. Medline (1946 to March 2014), EMBASE (1947 to March 2014), and the Cochrane central register (1993 to March 2014) were searched for randomized and observational studies.

Results

Of 696 identified records, 61 full-text articles were screened and 34 were included. In total, 5 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n = 322), 12 phase I/II trials (n = 287), 6 observational studies (n = 7,599), and 11 case reports (n = 267) were identified. Because of study heterogeneity, no meta-analyses were performed. No RCTs reported any statistically significant improvements in overall or progression-free survival or reduced toxicity with ascorbate relative to control arm. Evidence for ascorbate's antitumor effects was limited to case reports and observational and uncontrolled studies.

Conclusion

There is no high-quality evidence to suggest that ascorbate supplementation in cancer patients either enhances the antitumor effects of chemotherapy or reduces its toxicity. Given the high financial and time costs to patients of this treatment, high-quality placebo-controlled trials are needed.

### Vitamin C and COVID-19 treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^bcfd85a8]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Vitamin C has been used as an anti-oxidant in various diseases including viral illnesses like coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Methods

Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) investigating the role of vitamin C supplementation in COVID-19 was carried out.

Results

Total 6 RCTs including n = 572 patients were included. Vitamin C treatment didn't reduce mortality (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.27; I² = 0%; P = 0.27), ICU length of stay [SMD 0.29, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.63; I² = 0%; P = 0.09), hospital length of stay (SMD -0.23, 95% CI -1.04 to 0.58; I² = 92%; P = 0.57) and need for invasive mechanical ventilation (Risk Ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.44; I² = 0%; P = 0.76). Further sub-group analysis based on severity of illness (severe vs. non-severe), route of administration (IV vs. oral) and dose (high vs. low) failed to show any observable benefits.

Conclusion

No significant benefit noted with vitamin C administration in COVID-19. Well-designed RCTs with standardized control group needed on this aspect.

### Intravenous vitamin C for patients hospitalized with COVID-19: two harmonized randomized clinical trials [^23cbab7f]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP (critically ill) was published by LOVIT-COVID Investigators and colleagues in 2023 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP (critically ill) study, the trial question was: what is the role of intravenous vitamin C in critically ill patients hospitalized with COVID-19? In the LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP (critically ill) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP (critically ill) study, the population was: 1569 patients (564 female, 1005 male). The inclusion criteria were critically ill patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy; healthcare-associated pneumonia; imminent death; known allergy to vitamin C. In the LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP (critically ill) study, the interventions were: n = 1037 vitamin C (IV dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight over 30–60 minutes every 6 hours for 96 hours) n = 532 control (no vitamin C or placebo). In the LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP (critically ill) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in median organ support-free days to 21 days (7 days vs. 10 days; OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.06). In the LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP (critically ill) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in survival without persistent organ dysfunction at day 28 (57.1% vs. 60.7%; OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.12) No significant difference in the rate of survival to day 28 (65% vs. 67.2%; OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.19) Significant decrease in the rate of endotracheal intubation through day 28 (35.5% vs. 32.5%; OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.99). In the LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP (critically ill) study, the conclusion was: in critically ill patients hospitalized with COVID-19, vitamin C was not superior to control with respect to median organ support-free days to 21 days.

Clinical studies testing high doses

Despite the impressive evidence about vitamin C's key functions in the human body, limited evidence exists about the optimal application strategy to compensate for deficiencies and optimize the body's immune defense mechanisms. In critically ill patients, 2–3 g IV vitamin C is necessary to normalize vitamin C plasma concentrations. Clinical studies investigated both repletion and pharmacological doses varying from 0.5 to 125 g per day and differed in treatment duration and route of administration.

In patients with sepsis and/or ARDS, positive effects were observed for standalone high‐dose IV vitamin C in the CITRIS‐ALI trial, whereas no effect on mortality could be detected in RCTs using the HAT mixture (see Table S11). Neutralizing interactions as part of the HAT mixture could be a potential explanation. However, the recent LOVIT landmark trial (n = 863) does not confirm this hypothesis. The composite primary end point of death or persistent organ dysfunction was significantly higher in patients who received vitamin C 50 mg/kg every 6 h for 4 days compared with placebo, whereas interestingly no harmful effects could be demonstrated for vitamin C when comparing the effects of high‐dose vitamin C on the single components of the outcome. A subsequent meta‐analysis showed a benefit for short‐term mortality in studies with a high risk of bias, whereas the point estimate was toward harm for the 90 day mortality outcome in trials with a low risk of bias. Furthermore, a more recent systematic review and meta‐analysis demonstrated that despite the findings of the LOVIT study, IV vitamin C monotherapy may be associated with overall mortality benefits in critically ill patients with a high risk of dying.

### High dose intravenous vitamin C treatment in sepsis: associations with acute kidney injury and mortality [^1d6a6ef0]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Vitamin C is required for many biological functions including tissue repair, proper immune function, and healing. In sepsis patients, vitamin C levels are depleted thus IV vitamin C therapy is proposed as a mechanism of sepsis treatment. This retrospective review of patients with sepsis revealed though that early use of high dose IV vitamin C may increase the likelihood of AKI and does not serve as a protective factor against mortality. The association of vitamin C with AKI, along with the association of AKI and mortality in patients admitted to the ICU, suggests that high doses of vitamin C may not be beneficial but toxic. This finding, coupled with results from multiple randomized controlled prospective studies of IV vitamin C with mixed results, suggests that wide-spread use of high dose IV vitamin C requires further assessment. Research examining whether there are significant differences in IV vitamin C therapy toxicity among sub-group populations is necessary to further identify appropriate usage of IV Vitamin C therapy. These investigations should also include the different sources of sepsis related to hospital admissions, including those admitted through other routes than the emergency department. Additional research utilizing existing hospital data from across the nation and worldwide are needed to better understand the relationship between high dose IV vitamin C therapy and subsequent outcomes as well as determine the toxic/effective dose.

### The outcome of IV vitamin C therapy in patients with sepsis or septic shock: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^8b9f12f6]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction related to a dysregulated host response to infection, and septic shock is a type of sepsis with a higher risk of mortality. This disorder contributes to 11 million deaths worldwide every year, which is considered as a primary health threat by the World Health Organization. Despite significant advances in sepsis, no other treatment beyond basic therapy such as source of infection control, fluid resuscitation and vasoactive drugs has sufficient evidence to support to improve mortality, and sepsis survivors often suffer from residual organ injury. Consequently, it is very necessary to find effective, safe and economical adjuvant treatments to reduce mortality and financial burden for sepsis.

Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant drug and a cofactor in the production of numerous biosynthetic enzymes needed for the survival of shock, which participates in the synthesis of intrinsic vasopressin and norepinephrine. Vitamin C cannot be synthesized by the human, and the levels are low in many critically ill patients. As a readily available, inexpensive and few side effects of treatment option, vitamin C supplementation during sepsis has specifically gained increasing interest for years. Early studies confirmed IV vitamin C (IVVC) is associated with decreased inflammatory response and ameliorated outcomes in sepsis. In addition, favorable outcomes in the vitamin C group were reported in some meta-analyses. However, the available evidence remains inconsistent. In another recent meta-analysis, it was reported that IVVC suggested no efficacy in sepsis. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign of 2021: International Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock suggest IVVC for patients with sepsis or septic shock was not recommended, only as a weak recommendation according to the low quality of evidence. Although systematic reviews and meta-analyses discussing IVVC in patients with sepsis were recently published, these studies did not include the newer randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a larger population of patients to provide better evidence.

Because of increasing updated trials and inconsistent results in many studies, it is essential to reassess the present evidence about the efficacy and safety of IVVC in sepsis or septic shock patients. The purpose of this meta-analysis of RCTs is to research the impact of IVVC in sepsis patients and carry out subgroup analyses to further explore the efficacy of IVVC with different dose, type of therapy, duration and patient populations.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^7fe6f050]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Vitamin C in adults with sepsis or septic shock — We suggest against using IV vitamin C (Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). The updated analysis included seven RCTs (416 critically ill patients) and found that vitamin C did not reduce mortality compared to usual care (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.1). In one study, among patients alive at 7 days, 22% (16/72) receiving vitamin C remained on vasopressors compared to 10% (6/59) of controls, and subsequent randomized evidence reported no difference for time alive and free of vasopressors up to 168 hours between intervention and control groups.

### High dose intravenous vitamin C treatment in sepsis: associations with acute kidney injury and mortality [^b020bf37]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Similarly, research assessing the role of high dose vitamin C in causing or protected against acute kidney injury (AKI) is also conflicting and lacks validity. Several case reports have identified AKI and oxalate nephropathy in patients who received high doses of vitamin C. Other research has suggested vitamin C may have some level of protectiveness against AKI while other research including the large clinical trial, VICTAS, found there was no harmful or beneficial relationship. Given the contradictory findings in both RCTs and observational studies, more research is needed to ascertain the effects of vitamin C therapy among septic patients. In the current study, a retrospective analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship of intravenous (IV) vitamin C on AKI and mortality among patients with sepsis.

Vitamin C is very cheap and remarkably safe, being a water soluble vitamin which is readily excreted by the kidneys or removed by haemodialysis. Although more studies clearly need to be carried out, the preliminary findings indicating both prevention and treatment of severe infections and sepsis by vitamin C are encouraging.

### Evaluating vitamin C in septic shock: a randomized controlled trial of vitamin C monotherapy [^b016deed]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether IV vitamin C therapy reduces 28-day mortality in patients with septic shock.

Design

Multicenter, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial.

Setting

One academic medical ICU and four community ICUs.

Patients

Of 167 adult patients within 24 hours of vasopressor initiation for septic shock, 126 consented to participation, and 124 received study drug and were included in analysis.

Interventions

IV vitamin C (10mg/mL in normal saline) administered as a 1,000-mg bolus over 30 minutes followed by continuous infusion of 250mg/hr for 96 hours or placebo of equal volumes of normal saline.

Measurements and Main Results

Of 124 subjects receiving study drug and included in analysis, 60 received vitamin C and 64 placebo. The primary outcome of all-cause 28-day mortality (vitamin C, 26.7%; placebo, 40.6%; p = 0.10) was lower in the vitamin C arm but did not reach statistical significance. Initiation of renal replacement therapy was higher in the vitamin C arm (vitamin C, 16.7%; placebo, 3.3%; p = 0.015), as was volume of fluid administration within 6 hours of study drug initiation (vitamin C, 1.07L; placebo, 0.76L; p = 0.03). There were no statistically significant differences in other secondary outcomes. In post hoc subgroup analysis, there was a decrease in 28-day mortality in the vitamin C arm among patients requiring positive-pressure ventilation at the time of enrollment (vitamin C, 36.3%; placebo, 60.0%; p = 0.05). This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov under identifier NCT03338569.

Conclusions

Vitamin C monotherapy failed to significantly reduce mortality in septic shock patients as hypothesized. Our findings do not support its routine clinical use for this purpose.

### Effect of IV high-dose vitamin C on mortality in patients with sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^9f2ab680]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to investigate whether IV high-dose vitamin C improves the short-term mortality of patients with sepsis.

Design

This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. We searched EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and MEDLINE for randomized controlled trials that met inclusion criteria. The protocol was registered at the University hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000040528). All analyses were presented with the use of random-effects models. The primary outcome was short-term mortality defined as 28-day, 30-day, or in-hospital mortality.

Patients

Two authors independently evaluated the following eligibility criteria: 1) randomized controlled trial, 2) patients with sepsis aged ≥ 18 years, and 3) received intravenous high-dose vitamin C in addition to standard of care, or standard of care alone. Then, two authors independently extracted the selected patient and study characteristics and outcomes from studies that met above eligibility criteria.

Measurements and Main Results

Eleven randomized controlled trials (n = 1,737 patients) were included in this meta-analysis. High-dose IV vitamin C was not associated with a significantly lower short-term mortality (risk ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.73–1.06; p = 0.18; I² = 29%) but was associated with a significantly shorter duration of vasopressor use (standardized mean difference, -0.35; 95% CI, -0.63 to -0.07; p < 0.01; I² = 80%) and a significantly greater decline in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at 72–96 hours (standardized mean difference, -0.20; 95% CI, -0.32 to -0.08; p < 0.01; I² = 16%). One study reported significant association with hypernatremia, but adverse effects were rare, and high-dose vitamin C is deemed relatively safe.

Conclusions

In this meta-analysis, the use of IV high-dose vitamin C in patients with sepsis was not associated with lower short-term mortality although it was associated with significantly shorter duration of vasopressor use and greater decline in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at 72–96 hours.

### Evaluating vitamin C in septic shock: a randomized controlled trial of vitamin C monotherapy [^88f48f6c]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVES:

To determine whether IV vitamin C therapy reduces 28-day mortality in patients with septic shock.

DESIGN:

Multicenter, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial.

SETTING:

One academic medical ICU and four community ICUs.

PATIENTS:

Of 167 adult patients within 24 hours of vasopressor initiation for septic shock, 126 consented to participation, and 124 received study drug and were included in analysis.

INTERVENTIONS:

IV vitamin C (10 mg/mL in normal saline) administered as a 1,000-mg bolus over 30 minutes followed by continuous infusion of 250 mg/hr for 96 hours or placebo of equal volumes of normal saline.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:

Of 124 subjects receiving study drug and included in analysis, 60 received vitamin C and 64 placebo. The primary outcome of all-cause 28-day mortality (vitamin C, 26.7%; placebo, 40.6%; p = 0.10) was lower in the vitamin C arm but did not reach statistical significance. Initiation of renal replacement therapy was higher in the vitamin C arm (vitamin C, 16.7%; placebo, 3.3%; p = 0.015), as was volume of fluid administration within 6 hours of study drug initiation (vitamin C, 1.07 L; placebo, 0.76 L; p = 0.03). There were no statistically significant differences in other secondary outcomes. In post hoc subgroup analysis, there was a decrease in 28-day mortality in the vitamin C arm among patients requiring positive-pressure ventilation at the time of enrollment (vitamin C, 36.3%; placebo, 60.0%; p = 0.05). This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov under identifier NCT03338569.

CONCLUSIONS:

Vitamin C monotherapy failed to significantly reduce mortality in septic shock patients as hypothesized. Our findings do not support its routine clinical use for this purpose.

### Harm of IV high-dose vitamin C therapy in adult patients: a scoping review [^cacfedc4]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The potential harm associated with the use of IV vitamin C has not been systematically assessed. We aimed to review the available evidence on harm related to such treatment.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, National Institute of Health Clinical Trials Register, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.

Study Selection

We included studies in adult population that reported harm related to IV high-dose vitamin C which we defined as greater than or equal to 6g/d, greater than or equal to 75mg/kg/d, or greater than or equal to 3g/m/d.

Data Extraction

Two independent investigators screened records and extracted data.

Data Synthesis

We identified 8,149 reports, of which 650 full text were assessed for eligibility, leaving 74 eligible studies. In these studies, 2,801 participants received high-dose vitamin C at a median (interquartile range) dose of 22.5g/d (8.25–63.75g/d), 455mg/kg/d (260-925mg/kg/d), or 70g/m/d (50-90g/m/d); and 932 or more adverse events were reported. Among nine double-blind randomized controlled trials (2,310 patients), adverse events were reported in three studies with an event rate per patient for high-dose vitamin C identical to placebo group in one study (0.1 [1/10] vs 0.1 [1/10]), numerically lower in one study (0.80 [672/839] vs 0.82 [709/869]), and numerically higher in one study (0.33 [24/73] vs 0.23 [17/74]). Six double-blind randomized controlled trials reported no adverse event in either group. Five cases of oxalate nephropathy, five cases of hypernatremia, three cases of hemolysis in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency patients, two cases of glucometer error, and one case of kidney stones were also reported overall.

Conclusions

There is no consistent evidence that IV high-dose vitamin C therapy is more harmful than placebo in double-blind randomized controlled trials. However, reports of oxalate nephropathy, hypernatremia, glucometer error, and hemolysis in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency patients warrant specific monitoring.

### The outcome of IV vitamin C therapy in patients with sepsis or septic shock: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^b15c0794]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

To update a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and further explore the outcome of IV vitamin C (IVVC) administration in sepsis or septic shock patients.

Methods

This study is a meta-analysis of RCTs. The RCTs of vitamin C therapy in sepsis or septic shock were searched in PubMed, EMBASE and Clinical Trials.gov from inception to January 16, 2023. We registered the protocol with PROSPERO (CRD42022354875). The primary outcome was delta Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at 72–96 h. Two reviewers independently assessed RCTs according to eligibility criteria: (1) study type: RCT; (2) patient population: patients ≥ 18 years with sepsis or septic shock; (3) intervention: IVVC at any doses as monotherapy or combined with thiamine or and hydrocortisone compared with standard of care, no intervention or placebo (defined as control group); (4) the RCT described short-term mortality or SOFA score. Then, two authors independently extracted related information from RCTs.

Results

Eighteen RCTs (n = 3364 patients) were identified in this meta-analysis. There were significant effects in the delta SOFA score from baseline to 72–96 h (MD, − 0.62; 95% CI, − 1.00 to − 0.25; p = 0.001) and the duration of vasopressor use (MD, − 15.07; 95% CI, − 21.59 to − 8.55; p < 0.00001) with IVVC therapy. Treatment with IVVC was not shown to improve short-term mortality (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.04; p = 0.14); nevertheless, dose at 25–100 mg/kg/d subgroup associated with a significant reduction in short-term mortality (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.97; p = 0.03). An increase adverse event was observed in IVVC therapy (OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.06 to 3.68; p = 0.03).

Conclusion

In this meta-analysis, IVVC in sepsis or septic shock patients significantly improved delta SOFA score and reduced the duration of vasopressor use, whereas it was not associated with reduction in short-term mortality and had higher adverse events.

### Intravenous vitamin C (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^9f52a06a]. NCI (2013). Low credibility.

This summary contains the following key information:

- Vitamin C is an essential nutrient with redox functions at normal physiologic concentrations.
- Case series and observational studies from the 1970s of patients with cancer who received IV vitamin C seemed to indicate a clinical benefit.
- Two early randomized placebo-controlled trials that used oral vitamin C without IV vitamin C noted no significant differences between ascorbate-treated and placebo-treated groups for symptoms, performance status, or survival.
- Laboratory studies have reported that IV vitamin C has redox properties and decreased cell proliferation in prostate, pancreatic, hepatocellular, colon, mesothelioma, and neuroblastoma cell lines.
- IV vitamin C has been generally well tolerated in clinical trials.
- IV administration of vitamin C of doses over 500 mg produces much higher blood concentrations of ascorbate than oral administration of the same dose.

Health care practitioners attending complementary and alternative medicine conferences in 2006 and 2008 were surveyed about usage of high-dose IV vitamin C in patients. Of the 199 total respondents, 172 had administered vitamin C to patients. In general, IV vitamin C was commonly used to treat infections, cancer, and fatigue. 7] Vitamin C was given at doses ranging from 15 g to 65 g, initially once or twice a week for several months; two patients then received it less frequently for 1 to 4 years. One study demonstrated that IV vitamin C treatment resulted in improved quality of life and a decrease in cancer-related side effects in patients with cancer. Studies have shown that vitamin C can be safely administered to healthy volunteers or patients with cancer at doses up to 1. 5 g/kg and with screening to eliminate treating individuals with risk factors for toxicity.

These studies have also found that plasma concentrations of vitamin C are higher with IV administration than with oral administration and are maintained for more than 4 hours. In 2014, a phase I/IIA clinical trial evaluated the toxicities of combining IV ascorbate with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with stage III/IV ovarian cancer. Twenty-seven patients were randomly assigned to receive either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy and IV vitamin C concurrently. Chemotherapy was given for 6 months, and IV vitamin C was given for 12 months. The addition of IV vitamin C was associated with reduced chemotherapy-related toxicities.

### The outcome of IV vitamin C therapy in patients with sepsis or septic shock: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^27d418ed]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

We attempted to determine whether there may be some significant differences between high and low dose of vitamin C by performing a subgroup analysis comparing mortality. Interestingly, our results revealed that dose at 25–100 mg/kg/d IVVC was associated with improved short-term mortality, which was contrary to previous meta-analysis that high-dose (≥ 10 g/d) IVVC was benefit for mortality. CITRIS-ALI trial revealed that compared with placebo, high-dose vitamin C (50 mg/kg every 6 h) had a lower 28-day mortality in exploratory analysis, while the larger-scale LOVIT trial did not improve 28-day mortality. In addition, a component network meta-analysis demonstrated high-dose (> 6 g/d) and very-high dose vitamin C (> 12 g/d) was associated with decreased mortality but with low certainty. The exact mechanism by which low-dose vitamin C works has not been clarified. However, these studies populations of previous meta-analysis included critically ill patients. It is unclear whether higher doses confer greater benefits; although low dose was used in VITAMINS trial, the vitamin C level reached almost the same concentration at 6 h as published in CITRIS-ALI trial of a high dosing regimen at 48 h.

### High dose intravenous vitamin C treatment in sepsis: associations with acute kidney injury and mortality [^8961a97f]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical summary

Existing research regarding the effect of vitamin C on outcomes in patients with sepsis is inconsistent.
This retrospective study of patients hospitalized for sepsis revealed an association between IV vitamin C usage and subsequent AKI and in-hospital mortality.
The relationship between early treatment of high dose IV vitamin C and mortality in septic patients might suggest potential nephrotoxicity of vitamin C therapy.
Findings, coupled with results from multiple randomized controlled prospective studies of IV vitamin C with mixed results, suggests that wide-spread use of high dose IV vitamin C requires further assessment.

- Vitamin C is a nutrient found in food and dietary supplements. It is an antioxidant and also plays a key role in making collagen.
- Vitamin C may be taken by mouth or given by an intravenous infusion. When taken by IV infusion, vitamin C can reach higher levels in the blood than when the same amount is taken by mouth. How is vitamin C given or taken. Vitamin C may be given by intravenous infusion or taken by mouth. When given by IV infusion, vitamin C can reach much higher levels in the blood than when it is taken by mouth. Have any laboratory or animal studies been done using IV vitamin C.
- One study found that people with cancer who received IV vitamin C had better quality of life and fewer cancer-related side effects than those who did not receive it.
- In a single-arm pilot study of people with castration-resistant prostate cancer, IV vitamin C did not lower prostate-specific antigen levels or stop tumors from growing.
- In a study of healthy volunteers and people with cancer, vitamin C was shown to be safe at doses up to 1. 5 g/kg in people who do not have kidney stones, other kidney diseases, or G6PD deficiency. Studies have also shown that vitamin C levels in the blood are higher when given by IV than when taken by mouth, and last for more than 4 hours.
- In a study of people newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, IV vitamin C did not interfere with gemcitabine.
- In another small study, 9 people with advanced pancreatic cancer were given chemotherapy once a week for 3 weeks along with IV vitamin C twice a week for 4 weeks during each treatment cycle. The cancer did not progress over an average of 6 months in these patients. No serious side effects were reported with the combined treatment.
- In a study of 27 people with advanced ovarian cancer, chemotherapy alone was compared with chemotherapy and IV vitamin C. IV vitamin C was given during chemotherapy and for 6 months after chemotherapy ended.

Those who received IV vitamin C had fewer side effects from the chemotherapy.
- People with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer or metastatic melanoma were treated with IV vitamin C given along with arsenic trioxide and other drugs. The treatment had no anticancer effect, the tumor continued to grow during treatment, and patients had serious side effects. These studies did not have a comparison group, so it is unclear how much the IV vitamin C affected the side effects.

### Intravenous vitamin C in adults with sepsis in the intensive care unit: still LOV' IT? [^e99f2ed4]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The recent results of the lessening organ dysfunction with vitamin C (LOVIT) randomized controlled trial (RCT) have challenged the potentially beneficial role and brought concerns on the safety of high-dose vitamin C in patients with sepsis. Septic patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) received either high-dose vitamin C or placebo. As opposed to placebo, vitamin C was associated with an increased occurrence of the primary endpoint (persistent organ dysfunction plus death). While these results may suggest the end of the vitamin C story, several aspects suggest that LOVIT is just one piece of the puzzle and that the baby should not be thrown out with the bathwater.

Regarding LOVIT, it should be noted that although the primary endpoint was met, there were no differences in its individual components. Imbalances in baseline characteristics may have contributed to the observed differences. Patients in the intervention group had 10% higher lactate levels, were more often in shock and mechanically ventilated already at baseline. Thus, compared to placebo, patients receiving vitamin C appeared to be sicker, overall contributing to the higher risk of organ dysfunction.

The results of LOVIT differ from previous RCTs, where beneficial effects of vitamin C were observed: Vitamin C may restore vascular responsiveness to vasoactive agents, improve microcirculatory blood flow, preserve endothelial function, augment bacterial defense and prevent apoptosis. 2 Due to its redox-potential and powerful antioxidant capacities, vitamin C may modify the inflammatory cascade and related organ dysfunctions. Observational studies demonstrated low vitamin C levels to be associated with organ dysfunctions in septic patients. As humans are incapable to synthesize and store vitamin C, supplementation to replete vitamin C pool is imperative.

The clinical significance of high-dose vitamin C given as a "sepsis cocktail" with hydrocortisone and thiamine was popularized by Marik et al. This cocktail significantly reduced hospital mortality, time on vasopressor and organ injury. Consequently, numerous RCTs assessing the effects of IV vitamin C have been performed in critically ill patients followed by several systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SRMA). Some demonstrated benefits including lower mortality, less organ dysfunction and reduced duration on vasopressor support in those patients receiving high-dose vitamin C. None of these trials showed evidence of harm of high-dose vitamin C in septic or non-septic critically ill patients, with exception of one study using a prolonged continuous infusion of vitamin C that indicated an increase in acute kidney injury (AKI). No evidence of increased AKI was observed in LOVIT.

### Is the VITAMINS RCT indicating potential redundancy between corticosteroids and vitamin C? [^8534ab43]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Since the publication of the retrospective before and after study by Dr. Marik and colleagues, in which administration of hydrocortisone, intravenous (IV) vitamin C, and thiamine was indicated to provide a survival advantage in septic patients, there has been a prevalence of clinical trials of variable quality and subsequent meta-analyses indicating variable outcomes. Unlike previous combination trials, which did not control for corticosteroid use in the control arm, the recently published VITAMINS randomized clinical trial standardized corticosteroid administration in the control arm to determine if IV vitamin C and thiamine could provide an additional survival advantage over hydrocortisone alone. This trial showed no benefit of the combination of hydrocortisone, IV vitamin C, and thiamine in comparison to hydrocortisone alone.

Although the accompanying editorial by Dr. Kalil suggested that in light of this finding, IV vitamin C has no place in critical care, limitations of the VITAMINS trial preclude this view. It is well established that septic patients exhibit a high prevalence of vitamin C deficiency, and a recently published clinical trial in JAMA indicated that IV vitamin C may provide a survival advantage in these patients. Since the VITAMINS trial did not include an arm with IV vitamin C monotherapy, this trial does not provide any information as to whether IV vitamin C is of benefit to septic patients in the absence of corticosteroid administration. This trial simply indicated that short-term IV vitamin C administration (mean of 3.4 days) may not be of additional benefit if corticosteroids are being administered to the patients. However, routine corticosteroid administration to septic patients is not a common clinical practice in all intensive care units.

Indeed, the VITAMINS trial may in fact indicate redundancy between vitamin C and corticosteroids. Vitamin C is thought to play a role in the stress response as evidenced by its very high concentrations in the adrenal glands and its release in response to ACTH. Furthermore, animals that cannot synthesize vitamin C have significantly elevated cortisol release in response to stress compared with animals that can synthesize vitamin C endogenously (reviewed in). Thus, administration of corticosteroids to septic patients may help compensate for deficient vitamin C concentrations in these patients. Alternatively, in the absence of corticosteroid administration, supplementation of deficient patients with vitamin C may help with their stress response and could potentially provide a survival advantage, particularly in patients with HPA axis dysregulation.

### Vitamin C pharmacokinetics in critically ill Patients: a randomized trial of four IV regimens [^890e60b9]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Early high-dose IV vitamin C is being investigated as adjuvant therapy in patients who are critically ill, but the optimal dose and infusion method are unclear. The primary aim of this study was to describe the dose-plasma concentration relationship and safety of four different dosing regimens.

Methods

This was a four-group randomized pharmacokinetic trial. Patients who were critically ill with multiple organ dysfunction were randomized to receive 2 or 10 g/d vitamin C as a twice daily bolus infusion or continuous infusion for 48 h. End points were plasma vitamin C concentrations during 96 h, 12-h urine excretion of vitamin C, and oxalate excretion and base excess. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using NONMEM.

Results

Twenty patients were included. A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model with creatinine clearance and weight as independent covariates described all four regimens best. With 2 g/d bolus, plasma vitamin C concentrations at 1 h were 29 to 50 mg/L and trough concentrations were 5.6 to 16 mg/L. With 2 g/d continuous, steady-state concentrations were 7 to 37 mg/L at 48 h. With 10 g/d bolus, 1-h concentrations were 186 to 244 mg/L and trough concentrations were 14 to 55 mg/L. With 10 g/d continuous, steady-state concentrations were 40 to 295 mg/L at 48 h. Oxalate excretion and base excess were increased in the 10 g/d dose. Forty-eight hours after discontinuation, plasma concentrations declined to hypovitaminosis levels in 15% of patients.

Conclusions

The 2 g/d dose was associated with normal plasma concentrations, and the 10 g/d dose was associated with supranormal plasma concentrations, increased oxalate excretion, and metabolic alkalosis. Sustained therapy is needed to prevent hypovitaminosis.

### A new clinical trial to test high-dose vitamin C in patients with COVID-19 [^8ca89978]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

With the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak now spreading across the world, people are seeking ways in which to potentially protect themselves from the virus or to alleviate its effects once caught. One such means that is being touted online and in the media is vitamin C.

Vitamin C is best known for its antioxidant properties, being able to scavenge damaging reactive oxygen species, thus protecting the body's cells and tissues from oxidative damage and dysfunction. However, the vitamin also has numerous other important functions within the body, many of which are known to support healthy immune function. During infection, vitamin C levels can become depleted and a person's requirement for vitamin C increases with the severity of the infection. In severe cases, this may require intravenous administration of gram doses in order to achieve high enough levels in the body to compensate for the enhanced turnover of the vitamin.

As of February 2020, the clinical characteristics of patients hospitalized with COVID-19-related pneumonia indicated that 26% were transferred to the ICU because of complications such as ARDS and shock. A recently published RCT carried out in the USA in 167 patients with sepsis-related ARDS indicated that administration of ~ 15 g/day of IV vitamin C for 4 days may decrease mortality in these patients. An earlier IV vitamin C trial of patients admitted to the ICU with pneumonia included hydrocortisone administration, however, systemic corticosteroid treatment has not been shown to have significant benefits in patients with COVID-19.

Just recently registered on(Identifier: NCT04264533), a new clinical trial to investigate vitamin C infusion for the treatment of severe 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia has begun in Wuhan, China. This is one of the first RCTs to test the effects of IV vitamin C in patients infected with this virus. In this trial, the investigators will treat 140 patients with a placebo control or intravenous vitamin C at a dose of 24 g/day for 7 days. They will assess requirements for mechanical ventilation and vasopressor drugs, organ failure scores, ICU length of stay and 28-day mortality.

The investigators of the new study hope to complete the trial by the end of September. Although the findings of this trial will be too late for the many thousands of people currently infected with the virus, the study will nevertheless provide valuable information as to the potential mitigation of symptoms by vitamin C during future viral outbreaks.

### The outcome of IV vitamin C therapy in patients with sepsis or septic shock: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^8e720c5f]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Dose

No study administered a dose of < 25 mg/kg/d, 14 studies (15 studies for short-term mortality) administered 25–100 mg/kg/d, and 3 studies administered > 100 mg/kg/d. 25–100 mg/kg/d IVVC administration was associated with reduced delta SOFA score (MD, − 0.85; 95% CI, − 1.23 to − 0.46; p < 0.0001; I² = 42%) and short-term mortality (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.97; p = 0.03; I² = 36%) as shown in Table 1.

Table 1
Subgroup analysis of delta SOFA score and short-term mortality

The type of therapy

Eleven studies analyzed IVVC combined with hydrocortisone and thiamine (combined therapy); among them, one study included only vitamin C and thiamine. Seven studies (6 studies for delta SOFA score) tested IVVC alone (monotherapy group). As shown in Table 1, there was prominent effect on delta SOFA score in combined therapy subgroup (MD, − 0.53; 95% CI, − 0.81 to − 0.25; p = 0.0002; I² = 6%).

Duration

Two studies (1 studies for delta SOFA score) analyzed IVVC duration of < 96 h. Five studies tested IVVC duration of 96 h. Eleven studies analyzed IVVC of unclear duration. The result suggested superiority of IVVC therapy in alleviating delta SOFA score at 96 h (MD, − 0.50; 95% CI, − 0.91 to − 0.08; p = 0.02; I² = 0%) and unclear (MD, − 0.76; 95% CI, − 1.32 to − 0.20; p = 0.008; I² = 68%) subgroup (Table 1).

### Intravenous vitamin C administration to patients with septic shock: a pilot randomised controlled trial [^a09fc917]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition comprising organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis is a growing global health issue, with an estimated 49 million cases worldwide resulting in 11 million deaths. As such, sepsis is responsible for 20% of annual global deaths. Septic shock is a more severe clinical presentation characterised by profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities and is associated with mortality rates greater than 40%. Sepsis is managed through empiric intravenous antibiotic therapy, source control of infection, fluid resuscitation, and vasopressor administration. Additionally, organ support is provided via mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy. Intravenous norepinephrine is usually the first-choice vasopressor to increase the mean arterial blood pressure ≥ 65 mmHg for patients with sepsis who remain hypotensive after adequate fluid resuscitation. At times, intravenous vasopressin is also commenced to aid mean arterial pressure target or decrease norepinephrine dosage.

Since the publication of several early trials indicating possible beneficial effects of intravenous vitamin C in critically ill patients with sepsis and septic shock, as monotherapy and in combination with thiamine and hydrocortisone, there has been an upsurge in clinical trials investigating its potential benefits in these patients. Various trials administering intravenous vitamin C to patients with sepsis and septic shock have indicated decreased vasopressor requirements, improved sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores, decreased ICU length of stay, and decreased mortality. However, some trials showed no effects of vitamin C intervention on SOFA scores, ICU length of stay, or mortality, so the evidence is currently mixed with regard to these outcomes. Since the emergence of severe coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19), research into the potential treatments of sepsis, a major complication of severe COVID-19, has become even more important. Early trials have indicated some potentially beneficial effects of intravenous vitamin C in severe COVID-19. In addition, the World Health Organisation has highlighted vitamin C as a potential adjunctive therapy with biologic plausibility for patients with critical COVID-19.

### High dose intravenous vitamin C treatment in sepsis: associations with acute kidney injury and mortality [^c8cdfb31]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The effects of vitamin C on clinical outcomes in critically ill patients remain controversial due to inconclusive studies. This retrospective observational cohort study evaluated the effects of vitamin C therapy on acute kidney injury (AKI) and mortality among septic patients.

Methods

Electronic medical records of 1390 patients from an academic hospital who were categorized as Treatment (received at least one dose of 1.5 g IV vitamin C, n = 212) or Comparison (received no, or less than 1.5 g IV vitamin C, n = 1178) were reviewed. Propensity score matching was conducted to balance a number of covariates between groups. Multivariate logistic regressions were conducted predicting AKI and in-hospital mortality among the full sample and a sub-sample of patients seen in the ICU.

Results

Data revealed that vitamin C therapy was associated with increases in AKI (OR = 2.07 95% CI [1.46–2.93]) and in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.67 95% CI [1.003–2.78]) after adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates. When stratified to examine ICU patients, vitamin C therapy remained a significant risk factor of AKI (OR = 1.61 95% CI [1.09–2.39]) and provided no protective benefit against mortality (OR = 0.79 95% CI [0.48–1.31]).

Conclusion

Ongoing use of high dose vitamin C in sepsis should be appraised due to observed associations with AKI and death.

### Vitamin C pharmacokinetics: implications for oral and intravenous use [^3fedcb5b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin C at high concentrations is toxic to cancer cells in vitro. Early clinical studies of vitamin C in patients with terminal cancer suggested clinical benefit, but 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials showed none. However, these studies used different routes of administration.

Objective

To determine whether plasma vitamin C concentrations vary substantially with the route of administration.

Design

Dose concentration studies and pharmacokinetic modeling.

Setting

Academic medical center.

Participants

17 healthy hospitalized volunteers.

Measurements

Vitamin C plasma and urine concentrations were measured after administration of oral and intravenous doses at a dose range of 0.015 to 1.25 g, and plasma concentrations were calculated for a dose range of 1 to 100 g.

Results

Peak plasma vitamin C concentrations were higher after administration of intravenous doses than after administration of oral doses (P < 0.001), and the difference increased according to dose. Vitamin C at a dose of 1.25 g administered orally produced mean (± sd) peak plasma concentrations of 134.8 ± 20.6 micromol/L compared with 885 ± 201.2 micromol/L for intravenous administration. For the maximum tolerated oral dose of 3 g every 4 hours, pharmacokinetic modeling predicted peak plasma vitamin C concentrations of 220 micromol/L and 13 400 micromol/L for a 50-g intravenous dose. Peak predicted urine concentrations of vitamin C from intravenous administration were 140-fold higher than those from maximum oral doses.

Limitations

Patient data are not available to confirm pharmacokinetic modeling at high doses and in patients with cancer.

Conclusions

Oral vitamin C produces plasma concentrations that are tightly controlled. Only intravenous administration of vitamin C produces high plasma and urine concentrations that might have antitumor activity. Because efficacy of vitamin C treatment cannot be judged from clinical trials that use only oral dosing, the role of vitamin C in cancer treatment should be reevaluated.

### The interplay between vitamin C and thyroid [^3cd1561a]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a water-soluble vitamin, that plays a key role in the prevention and treatment of scurvy. As vitamin C is an antioxidant and thyroid function may be affected and may affect vitamin C levels, for the first time, we aimed to provide a detailed review of all human studies evaluating the different roles of vitamin C in the thyroid gland. Thyroid cancers, goitre, Graves' disease and other causes of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism were the conditions discussed in this study. Furthermore, vitamin C addition to other medications such as levothyroxine was also reviewed.

Methods

In this study, we reviewed the relevant literature regarding the association between vitamin C and thyroid diseases using original studies from PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science.

Results

In this review, we found anti-cancer effects for intravenous (IV) administration of vitamin C in addition to the beneficial effects of using it in combination with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. As autoimmune diseases affect some antioxidant markers, some studies reported a significant difference in blood vitamin C levels in patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases such as Graves' disease. Despite many studies evaluating the effects of IV administration of vitamin C in mentioned diseases, there is a lack of evidence for oral consumption of vitamin C.

Conclusions

To conclude, there is a lack of evidence, especially clinical trials, for the therapeutic effects of vitamin C on thyroid diseases; however, promising results were reported in some studies in the literature.

### High dose intravenous vitamin C treatment in sepsis: associations with acute kidney injury and mortality [^1b24012b]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Study Design

The following data were collected from the EHR: patient demographics; past medical history; visit characteristics (i.e. pre-identified medications administered, laboratory results, order sets ordered); primary and secondary diagnoses; hospital and ICU LOS; vasoactive drug use; and in-hospital mortality. Vasoactive drug use was defined as having received Dobutamine, Dopamine, Epinephrine, Norepinephrine, Phenylephrine, or Vasopressin. AKI was defined using ICD-10 code discharge diagnoses. Doses of IV vitamin C received were captured to categorize patients into two groups; comparison group (No or < 1.5 g of IV vitamin C), and treatment group (≥ 1.5 g of IV vitamin C within 12 h of hospital admission). Individuals who received ≥ 1.5 g of IV vitamin C more than 12 h after hospital admission were excluded from the study as research suggests that vitamin C treatment after the first 12 h may not be as efficacious. Similarly, patients who received a couple of doses after 12 h and remaining within the time frame were also excluded to obtain a uniform comparable study sample. Of note, two patients in the comparison group received low doses of IV vitamin C of 0.5 g or less (Fig. 1).

### High-dose intravenous ascorbic acid: ready for prime time in traumatic brain injury? [^01b1da87]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading public health problems in the USA and worldwide. It is the number one cause of death and disability in children and adults between ages 1–44. Despite efforts to prevent TBIs, the incidence continues to rise. Secondary brain injury occurs in the first hours and days after the initial impact and is the most effective target for intervention. Inflammatory processes and oxidative stress play an important role in the pathomechanism of TBI and are exacerbated by impaired endogenous defense mechanisms, including depletion of antioxidants. As a reducing agent, free radical scavenger, and co-factor in numerous biosynthetic reactions, ascorbic acid (AA, vitamin C) is an essential nutrient that rapidly becomes depleted in states of critical illness. The administration of high-dose intravenous (IV) AA has demonstrated benefits in numerous preclinical models in the areas of trauma, critical care, wound healing, and hematology. A safe and inexpensive treatment, high-dose IV AA administration gained recent attention in studies demonstrating an associated mortality reduction in septic shock patients. High-quality data on the effects of high-dose IV AA on TBI are lacking. Historic data in a small number of patients demonstrate acute and profound AA deficiency in patients with central nervous system pathology, particularly TBI, and a strong correlation between low AA concentrations and poor outcomes. While replenishing deficient AA stores in TBI patients should improve the brain's ability to tolerate oxidative stress, high-dose IV AA may prove an effective strategy to prevent or mitigate secondary brain injury due to its ability to impede lipid peroxidation, scavenge reactive oxygen species, suppress inflammatory mediators, stabilize the endothelium, and reduce brain edema. The existing preclinical data and limited clinical data suggest that high-dose IV AA may be effective in lowering oxidative stress and decreasing cerebral edema. Whether this translates into improved clinical outcomes will depend on identifying the ideal target patient population and possible treatment combinations, factors that need to be evaluated in future clinical studies. With its excellent safety profile and low cost, high-dose IV AA is ready to be evaluated in the early treatment of TBI patients to mitigate secondary brain injury and improve outcomes.

### Adjuvant vitamin C for sepsis: mono or triple? [^b8e6ef95]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

The optimal dose of vitamin C is unknown, and systematic dose-finding during critical illness has not been performed. However, several facts are known. First, the antioxidant capacity of vitamin C is dose-dependent and direct radical scavenging capacity is maximal at a plasma vitamin C level > 175 mg/l (1000 μmol/l), more than ten times normal. In addition, other functions like immune modulation, inhibition of bacterial replication, and neuroprotection are dose-dependent as well. Second, intravenous dosing is necessary, because enteral uptake is limited. Third, intravenous vitamin C doses of 2–3 g/day are needed to normalize plasma concentrations and sustained therapy is needed to prevent reoccurrence of hypovitaminosis. The dose-concentration relationship is linear, so higher doses yield proportionally higher plasma concentrations. Plasma concentrations > 1000 μmol/l can be obtained with 10 g i.v. vitamin C/day. In the only dose-effect study in septic patients, the higher dose of i.v. vitamin C (200 mg/kg/day) improved organ dysfunction more than the lower dose of 50 mg/kg/day. A recent meta-analysis found a reduced mortality with medium-dose vitamin C (3–10 g/day) in critically ill patients, in contrast to low (< 3 g/day) or high doses (≥ 10 g/day). However, this meta-analysis included small studies, one third of these were retrospective, duration of treatment varied, and the CITRIS-ALI was not included. So more and larger studies comparing different doses are required before recommendations can be made about the optimal dose.

### IV vitamin C in adults with sepsis: a Bayesian reanalysis of a randomized controlled trial [^4454621e]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The Lessening Organ Dysfunction with Vitamin C trial showed a harmful effect of vitamin C on 28-day death or persistent organ dysfunction. To maximize interpretation, we present a post hoc Bayesian reanalysis.

Design

Bayesian reanalysis of a randomized placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

Thirty-five ICUs.

Patients

Adults with proven or suspected infection, vasopressor support, and no more than 24 hours of ICU admission.

Interventions

Patients were allocated to receive either vitamin C (50mg/kg of body weight) or placebo every 6 hours for up to 96 hours.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary outcome was the composite of death or persistent organ dysfunction (i.e., vasopressor use, invasive mechanical ventilation, or new renal replacement therapy) at 28 days. We used Bayesian log-binomial models with random effects for hospital site and varying informative prior beliefs for the effect of vitamin C to estimate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% credible intervals (Crls) in the intention to treat population (vitamin C, 435 patients; placebo, 437 patients). Using weakly neutral priors, patients allocated to vitamin C had a higher risk of death or persistent organ dysfunction at 28 days (RR, 1.20; 95% Crl, 1.04–1.39; probability of harm, 99%). This effect was consistent when using optimistic (RR, 1.14; 95% Crl, 1.00–1.31; probability of harm, 98%) and empiric (RR, 1.09; 95% Crl, 0.97–1.22; probability of harm, 92%) priors. Patients allocated to vitamin C also had a higher risk of death at 28 days under weakly neutral (RR, 1.17; 95% Crl, 0.98–1.40; probability of harm, 96%), optimistic (RR, 1.10; 95% Crl, 0.94–1.30; probability of harm, 88%), and empiric (RR, 1.05; 95% Crl, 0.92–1.19; probability of harm, 76%) priors.

Conclusions

The use of vitamin C in adult patients with proven or suspected infection and vasopressor support is associated with high probability of harm.

### Vitamin C for septic shock in previous randomized trials: implications of erroneous dosing, timing, and duration [^6c17a8f7]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

We read with interest the article by Rosengrave et al. on a pilot randomized trial to assess the efficacy of intravenous (IV) vitamin C for improving vasopressor requirements and other outcomes in patients with septic shock. They did not observe significant differences in the dose or duration of vasopressor use between the vitamin C and placebo groups. The authors argue that the study was limited by the small sample size (to detect differences in populations with a lower prevalence of vitamin C deficiency), insufficient dosage (median: 8 g/day), and delayed initiation of vitamin C (median: 18 h). Further studies considering these limitations are needed, although we would like to add several issues regarding vitamin C duration and patient heterogeneity.

Previous studies have demonstrated that some patients might experience hypovitaminosis C as early as 48 h after discontinuation of vitamin C infusion, regardless of the dosing regimen. Given that most randomized trials that failed to show a survival benefit of vitamin C limited its use to a maximum of 4 days, sustained therapy may be needed to obtain the favorable effects of vitamin C over time. In the CITRIS-ALI trial that evaluated the benefit of IV vitamin C among patients with sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome, the mortality rate was 81% lower in the 4-day treatment group than in the placebo group. However, there was no between-group difference in mortality after treatment cessation. In the study by Rosengrave et al. the dosing regimen may have been "too short" to observe any treatment effects because half of the intervention group did not receive vitamin C for the entire 4 days. We recently assessed the efficacy of vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine in a murine model of sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Vitamin C (45 mg/kg), hydrocortisone (1.5 mg/kg), and thiamine (3 mg/kg) were dissolved in 1 mL lactated Ringer's solution and administered intravenously starting 6 h after CLP and continued every 12 h for 4 days for a total of 8 doses. Fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy (25 mg/kg of imipenem in lactated Ringer's solution with 5% dextrose starting 6 h after CLP and continued every 12 h for a total of 6 doses) were also provided. Notably, over 50% of control mice died within 3 days of CLP, whereas all treated mice survived the 4-day intervention and only started to die after cessation of intervention (Fig. 1 a). Inflammatory biomarkers in serum measured 24 h after CLP (tumor necrosis factor-α) and in hepatocytes harvested 7 days after CLP (heme oxygenase 1 and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2) were significantly lower in the treated mice than in the control mice (Fig. 1 b, c). In addition, hepatocyte swelling and necrosis 7 days after CLP were markedly attenuated in the treated mice (Fig. 1 d). These findings are consistent with those in our previous nationwide cohort study that found significantly lower in-hospital mortality in sepsis patients treated with IV vitamin C for ≥ 5 days. In this study, the survival curves of patients who received vitamin C for 1–2 or 3–4 days tended to diverge earlier during the course of sepsis than did those of patients treated for ≥ 5 days.

### Efficacy and safety of parenteral high-dose vitamin C therapy in pediatric patients: a scoping review [^0189708a]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Recently, several adult trials have investigated the potential benefit of high-dose vitamin C therapy in critically ill patients. In pediatric patients, little is known on the efficacy, safety, and risk of high-dose vitamin C therapy. We aimed to review the efficacy and potential harm associated with high-dose vitamin C treatment.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and National Institute of Health Clinical Trials Register.

Study Selection

We included studies in neonatal and pediatric patients who received IV or intra-arterial high-dose vitamin C (ascorbic acid) defined as greater than or equal to 75mg/kg/d.

Data Extraction

Two independent investigators screened articles and extracted data.

Data Synthesis

We found 1,364 articles, assessed 193 full texts for eligibility, and identified 12 eligible studies. These studies included 855 patients, with 194 receiving high-dose vitamin C. The age of patients who received high-dose vitamin C ranged from 2 hours after delivery to 8.4 years (median 2.4 yr), and the vitamin C dose ranged from 100 to 1,500mg/kg/d (median 260.5mg/kg/d). Four studies were double-blind randomized controlled trials, and no clinical efficacy outcome was reported in favor of or against vitamin C. Furthermore, no adverse event or signal of harm was reported with high-dose vitamin C.

Conclusions

In 12 studies with 194 children treated with parenteral high-dose vitamin C, there was no evidence of clinical efficacy or inferior clinical outcomes in double-blind randomized controlled trials, and no reported harmful effects. These findings justify further investigations of this treatment in children.

### Vitamin C and thiamine for sepsis and septic shock [^0eca8217]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Intravenous (IV) vitamin C, thiamine, and hydrocortisone have shown promise in reducing hospital mortality. The Memphis Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) similarly implemented this regimen, called the vitamin C protocol, for patients presenting in sepsis or septic shock in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Methods

This retrospective study in Veteran ICU patients with sepsis or septic shock compared outcomes of patients treated with IV vitamin C, thiamine, and hydrocortisone (treatment) with those who received IV hydrocortisone alone (control). Data was propensity matched to ensure comparability at baseline. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was calculated at day of diagnosis (day 0) and daily for 3 subsequent days. At the 24-month follow-up, 12 months after the 1-year-intervention, survival and measures of mental and physical health were collected by telephone interviews.

Results

Hospital mortality, the primary outcome, did not differ significantly between groups. Secondary outcomes including ICU, 28-day, and 60-day mortality were also not different, nor were vasopressor duration or hospital length of stay. However, ICU length of stay was significantly reduced in the treatment group compared to control (7.1 vs 15.6 days, respectively, P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Although no significant mortality benefit was observed, the vitamin C protocol was not associated with patient harm. In this Veteran population, there was reduced ICU length of stay, suggesting possible benefit. Though further investigation is warranted, utilization of IV vitamin C, thiamine, and hydrocortisone in patients with sepsis or septic shock may be a treatment option worth considering.

### High dose intravenous vitamin C treatment in sepsis: associations with acute kidney injury and mortality [^b406d789]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

When examining in-hospital mortality, results revealed that being older, having AKI, longer ICU LOS, and receiving IV vitamin C were associated with increased risk of mortality. Specifically, the odds of mortality were 67% higher for the IV vitamin C group compared to those in the comparison group. The association between high dose vitamin C and death was unexpected and not easily explained. Another variable found to be associated with an increased risk of death, which may lend insight into the relationship between vitamin C and mortality, was the diagnosis of AKI. Previous research indicates kidney failure increases the risk of death six to eight times in septic patients. However, when examining the data in the current study, an increased risk of death was evident irrespective of AKI. Among patients who did not have AKI and did not receive IV vitamin C, 3.03% died compared to 7.46% of those who did not have AKI but received IV vitamin C. This suggests there may be a direct effect of high dose vitamin C that may exacerbate the risk of mortality. The current study lacked the data that would allow for a more comprehensive examination between high doses of IV vitamin C and potential increased toxicity outside of the kidney, however, future research should explore the relationship between vitamin C and mortality, irrespective of AKI.

The current finding that IV vitamin C is associated with increased risk of death is inconsistent with another large retrospective study which found IV vitamin C to be associated with reduced mortality among patients with sepsis. One reason for the disparate results may be differences in treatment dose. Specifically, vitamin C in the Byerly et al. study was not limited to high dose and was not defined by a threshold defining the treatment group, whereas the current study examines what is considered high dose IV vitamin C (≥ 1.5 g), which may account for outcome differences. One study that examined higher doses (200 mg/kg/day) of vitamin C showed evidence of increasing rates of mortality, with higher mortality (50.6%) among a high dose vitamin C group compared to patients who received lower doses of vitamin C (50 mg/kg/day) (38%), though both treatment groups had lower mortality than the placebo group (63%). Notably, this study was limited by a small sample size and did not reach statistical significance. Additional research examining other clinical markers including SOFA scores in patients receiving high dose IV vitamin C over long periods of time is needed.

### Vitamin C revisited [^75e007ae]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

This narrative review summarizes the role of vitamin C in mitigating oxidative injury-induced microcirculatory impairment and associated organ failure in ischemia/reperfusion or sepsis. Preclinical studies show that high-dose vitamin C can prevent or restore microcirculatory flow impairment by inhibiting activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase, augmenting tetrahydrobiopterin, preventing uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, and decreasing the formation of superoxide and peroxynitrite, and by directly scavenging superoxide. Vitamin C can additionally restore vascular responsiveness to vasoconstrictors, preserve endothelial barrier by maintaining cyclic guanylate phosphatase and occludin phosphorylation and preventing apoptosis. Finally, high-dose vitamin C can augment antibacterial defense. These protective effects against overwhelming oxidative stress due to ischemia/reperfusion, sepsis or burn seems to mitigate organ injury and dysfunction, and promote recovery after cardiac revascularization and in critically ill patients, in the latter partially in combination with other antioxidants. Of note, several questions remain to be solved, including optimal dose, timing and combination of vitamin C with other antioxidants. The combination obviously offers a synergistic effect and seems reasonable during sustained critical illness. High-dose vitamin C, however, provides a cheap, strong and multifaceted antioxidant, especially robust for resuscitation of the circulation. Vitamin C given as early as possible after the injurious event, or before if feasible, seems most effective. The latter could be considered at the start of cardiac surgery, organ transplant or major gastrointestinal surgery. Preoperative supplementation should consider the inhibiting effect of vitamin C on ischemic preconditioning. In critically ill patients, future research should focus on the use of short-term high-dose intravenous vitamin C as a resuscitation drug, to intervene as early as possible in the oxidant cascade in order to optimize macrocirculation and microcirculation and limit cellular injury.

### The outcome of IV vitamin C therapy in patients with sepsis or septic shock: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^7ce5ba88]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Trial sequential analysis

Cumulative meta-analysis updating with new RCTs may lead to false positive results (type I error) due to an increased risk of random error from sparse data. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) can reduce the risks of random error because of inadequate sample size or repetitive testing and estimate the required information size (RIS) for meta-analysis. Type I error and power were set as 5% and 80%, respectively. We performed TSA for both delta SOFA score and short-term mortality outcomes by applying TSA version 0.9.5.10 beta software.

### Vitamin C improves microvascular reactivity and peripheral tissue perfusion in septic shock patients [^0ca4e0e3]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Overall, the beneficial impact of vitamin C in sepsis patients is still into debate. In a recent meta-analysis including eleven randomized controlled trials and more than 1700 patients, high-dose IV vitamin C did not improve short-term survival, but was associated with a significantly shorter duration of vasopressor use, as well as a significantly greater decline in the SOFA score at day 3. Based on our results, we believe that future trial testing high-dose IV vitamin C treatment should be proposed in selected septic shock patients with peripheral tissue hypoperfusion, a subset of patients with very poor outcome.

Finally, we did not observe any adverse effect after vitamin C injection, confirming previous work showing that pharmacologic ascorbic acid administration is safe. It is noteworthy that Sartor et al. reported that point-of-care blood glucose measurements may become inaccurate after ascorbate injection, since the molecular structures of vitamin C and glucose are somewhat similar

Our study has several limitations. It is a monocentric study, and the results need to be confirmed in a larger population. Nevertheless, we found significative difference despite limited number of patients. Here, we did not include a control group and the improvement of peripheral tissue hypoperfusion could be, at least in part, related to initial resuscitation. However, rapid improvement of endothelial reactivity was unlikely due to fluid alone because in a previous work, we have shown in septic shock patients that saline infusion had no acute impact on endothelial dysfunction. Vitamin C improved vascular parameters in septic shock patients under vasopressor support, but we cannot affirm that the protective effect would be still observed in sepsis patients without vasopressor. Finally, we observed beneficial effect of vitamin C early after infusion but we did not analyze microvascular function and peripheral tissue perfusion at later stages.

### Reversal of the pathophysiological responses to Gram-Negative sepsis by megadose vitamin C [^9d0f935e]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is the main cause of death in ICUs, with a global occurrence rate of 49 million cases and 11 million deaths in 2017. Standard-of-care practice consists of antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and vasopressor support. There are no treatments that reverse the deterioration in clinical state and organ dysfunction associated with sepsis.

Oxidative stress may be responsible for inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction, common pathophysiologic features that contribute to sepsis-induced renal dysfunction. Indeed, we recently demonstrated that renal medullary tissue hypoxia develops early after the initiation of ovine sepsis and precedes the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). It is likely that a similar scenario contributes to the dysfunction of other organs in sepsis.

Vitamin C has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Patients with sepsis have subnormal plasma levels of vitamin C that correlate inversely with the occurrence rate of multiple-organ failure. In septic patients, high doses of vitamin C (50 and 200 mg/kg/24 hr) reduced the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores and the levels of proinflammatory biomarkers. In addition, in a single-center retrospective study, combined treatment with vitamin C (1.5 g every 6 hr) with hydrocortisone and thiamine reduced the SOFA score and mortality. Another trial of IV vitamin C (1.5 g, every 6 hr for 96 hr) showed a numerical reduction in 28-day mortality. However, in a recent randomized multicenter clinical trial in septic patients, IV infusion of vitamin C (1.5 g every 6 hr), together with thiamine and hydrocortisone, did not significantly improve SOFA scores or mortality. Thus, the benefit of vitamin C therapy in sepsis remains controversial.

Dose, timing, and duration of vitamin C administration are critical factors that likely determine the response in sepsis, but these factors lack detailed investigation. We reasoned that, in the setting of established severe sepsis, a much higher dose (megadose) than tested so far would be needed. Since extremely high doses of vitamin C have been given in cancer and burn patients without major side effects, we hypothesized that such a dose would be safe and might be effective in established sepsis. We therefore determined the safety and efficacy of IV megadose sodium ascorbate, the sodium salt of vitamin C, on cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary, and hepatic functions in an ovine model of sepsis in the presence of clinical triggers for intervention. Furthermore, compassionate use of IV sodium ascorbate is reported in a critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient.

### Reversal of the pathophysiological responses to Gram-Negative sepsis by megadose vitamin C [^66f237a2]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In established ovine sepsis, treatment with IV megadose sodium ascorbate was highly effective and safe. It caused a remarkable improvement in clinical state, reversed the pathophysiological decreases in cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary, and hepatic functions, and reduced the hyperlactatemia and body temperature. Importantly, we observed no adverse effects beyond hypernatremia and hypokalemia. It is now important to determine the optimal dose and treatment duration of sodium ascorbate and to investigate further the mechanisms of action. In addition, clinical studies are warranted to resolve the issue of whether megadose vitamin C has acute and long-term benefits in septic patients.

### Intravenous vitamin injections: where is the evidence? [^c9409d8f]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

The body needs small daily quantities of vitamins and minerals, which are usually obtained from the diet. Intravenous vitamins are used for a few serious medical conditions (eg, malabsorption syndromes with severe vitamin depletion, Wernicke's encephalopathy or critical illness). Intravenous drips containing high doses of various vitamins and minerals (eg, the so-called 'Myers' cocktail') have been promoted in popular culture to 'reduce stress', 'increase energy' or 'boost immunity', with claims that the intravenous route allows faster absorption of vitamins into the bloodstream than if they are taken orally. There is a lack of high-quality evidence to suggest that high-dose vitamin infusions are necessary or offer any health benefit in the absence of a specific vitamin deficiency or medical condition. There may be harms from taking high (non-physiological) quantities of some vitamins and minerals. Licensed forms of injectable vitamins that are prescription-only medicines should not be advertised to the public and should only be supplied and administered by appropriately qualified healthcare professionals.

### Adjuvant vitamin C in critically ill patients undergoing renal replacement therapy: what's the right dose? [^8e6b6030]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Recently there has been increased interest in the use of intravenous vitamin C as adjuvant therapy in patients with sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), burns and after cardiac arrest. The optimal dosage strategy in these patients is unclear with dosages varying from 50 mg/kg/day to 1584 mg/kg/day having being studied. The pharmacokinetics of intravenous vitamin C has been studied in healthy volunteers and critically ill patients. In healthy volunteers the pharmacokinetics of intravenous vitamin C are best described by a two-compartment linear dose-response relationship with a 1.25 g dose producing a peak concentration of approximately 885 umol/l. De Grooth et al. studied the pharmacokinetics of a twice daily bolus of 1 g of vitamin C in critically ill septic patients. The mean peak serum vitamin C concentration was 180 umol/l with a trough concentration of between 60 and 80 umol/l; approximately 50% of the administered dose was renally excreted. Vitamin C is freely filtered in the glomerulus with renal losses increasing with increasing plasma concentrations. As a large proportion of the vitamin C dose is renally excreted, serum levels will be significantly higher in anuric patients. Vitamin C is removed by renal replacement therapy. The serum levels of vitamin C in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) receiving adjuvant intravenous vitamin C and who are being treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has not been evaluated. Recently, Honore and colleagues proposed that patients (post cardiac arrest) not being treated with CRRT receive 6 g vitamin C daily and that the dose should be increased to 12 g/day in those receiving CRRT. While we strongly agree that 6 g/day is likely the optimal dose of intravenous vitamin C in critically ill patients, there is no data to suggest that the dose should be increased in patients receiving CRRT. Assuming a plasma vitamin C concentration of 200 umol/l with a hemofiltration dose (CVVH) of 2 L/h and a sieving coefficient of 1, the patient would lose 1.68 g/day (200*2*24 = 9600 umol/day). A daily dose of 6 g/day should adequately cover this loss. As part of an IRB approved study investigating the accuracy of point-of-care glucose monitors (Accu-Chek, Roche, Indianapolis, IN) in septic patients (n = 72) receiving intravenous vitamin C (6 g daily), we measured steady state trough and peak (within 30 min of end of infusion) vitamin C levels in 12 patients (Table 1). While the sample size is small, our limited data does not suggest dosage adjustment is required in patents receiving renal replacement therapy. Additional studies are required to confirm our findings.

Clinical studiestesting high doses

Only two trials have investigated folate supplementation in critically ill patients,(see Table S10). In the first, 40 critically ill patients with documented folate deficiency were randomly given 0.5 mg IV folinic acid daily for 10 days or a 5 mg folinic acid IV injection once on day 1. Serum and red blood cell levels on day 11 were found to have increased significantly in both groups, but red blood cell folate was higher in the group receiving daily supplementation. Importantly, nearly 50% of patients still had serum levels below the reference range at the end of the intervention period. The authors recommend providing 0.5 mg of intravenous folinic acid daily in patients with documented folate deficiency. The second study included 83 patients randomized at ICU admission to receive one of three prophylactic supplementation doses (5 mg/day IV folinic acid for 7 days, 50 mg folinic acid IV on day 1, or no folinic acid). Serum folate levels increased significantly in the two intervention groups, but to a greater extent in the group supplemented daily, and fewer patients had serum levels below the reference range at day 7 compared with the day 1 group, indicating that the best dosage may be 5 mg IV daily.

Implementation in clinical practice

The WHO recommends a daily intake of 0.4–1 mg of folate; however, the precise folate requirements in critical illness are unknown. In patients at risk of malnutrition or having any predisposing factors (such as those receiving CRRT) to folate deficiency, folic acid status may be measured at first assessment and supplemented according to the results.

Vitamin C

Main form and function

Ascorbate is the main form of vitamin C in the human body. Vitamin C is crucial for recovery during critical illness because it optimizes the body's antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory defense mechanisms, regulates norepinephrine and collagen synthesis, restores microcirculatory flow, prevents apoptosis, and reduces ischemia‐reperfusion injury.

Plasma concentrations in critically ill patients

Significantly depleted vitamin C plasma concentrations have been repeatedly reported in critically ill patients with heterogeneous conditions (68% vitamin C < 23 μmol/L, 32% < 11 μmol/L), but also in different subgroups: sepsis, COVID‐19, after major surgery, cardiac arrest, and the lowest levels in patients with multiple organ failure.

### High dose intravenous vitamin C treatment in sepsis: associations with acute kidney injury and mortality [^5d0abd3a]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Sub-analyses of the ICU sample revealed that age, longer ICU LOS, and receiving IV vitamin C remained predictors of AKI, while identifying as black and being male were no longer significant predictors. Older age, and ICU LOS are both known risk factors supported by previous research. A second sub-analysis revealed that age and AKI remained significant predictors of in-hospital mortality, however high dose IV vitamin C use was no longer a statistically significant predictor of mortality once the sample was limited to ICU patients only.

The current study observed a moderate relationship between IV vitamin C and mortality in septic patients, which might suggest potential nephrotoxicity of vitamin C therapy. The association between high dose vitamin C and AKI due to oxalate deposition in renal tubules is well established. Since early reports in 1985, there are multiple cases of AKI resulting from high dose vitamin C, administered parenterally or orally. Ascorbic acid is metabolized intracellularly and converted to oxalic acid; the oxalic acid is then filtered in the kidney where it precipitates into crystals of calcium oxalate, potentially causing obstruction and tubular injury. Previous research has shown that vitamin C doses as low as 480–960 mg/D, taken orally over several months, have resulted in oxalate deposition kidney failure that requires temporary dialysis. Dietary supplementation of 2 g per day can increase oxalate excretion by 21.8%. Oxalic acid and oxalate toxicity have been shown to occur in myocardial tissue of patients with hereditary hyperoxaluria. Others have suggested that similar myocardial tissue damage can occur in secondary forms of hyperoxalosis. Acutely elevated oxalate levels in the serum could cause myocardial dysfunction, leading to increased risk of mortality regardless of AKI.

### Ascorbic acid in the acute care setting [^648b5a51]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Ascorbic acid (AA) is an essential nutrient with many physiologic roles not limited to the prevention of scurvy. Beyond its role as a supplement, it has gained popularity in the acute care setting as an inexpensive medication for a variety of conditions. Because of limitations with absorption of oral formulations and reduced serum concentrations observed in acute illness, intravenous (IV) administration, and higher doses, may be needed to produce the desired serum concentrations for a particular indication. Following a PubMed search, we reviewed published studies relevant to AA in the acute care setting and summarized the results in a narrative review. In the acute care setting, AA may be used for improved wound healing, improved organ function in sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome, faster resolution of vasoplegic shock after cardiac surgery, reduction of resuscitative fluids in severe burn injury, and as an adjunctive analgesic, among other uses. Each indication differs in its level of evidence supporting exogenous administration of AA, but overall, AA was not commonly associated with adverse effects in the identified studies. Use of AA remains an active area of clinical investigation for various indications in the acute care patient population.

2 CANCER

A growing body of evidence documented the anti‐cancer potential of vitamin C, and several pre‐clinical and clinical studies have confirmed this concept. The anti‐cancer effect of vitamin C was first introduced nearly 50 years ago by Pauling and Cameron. They showed in clinical studies that intravenous vitamin C (∼10 g daily) could increase the survival duration of patients with incurable cancer. Vitamin C was used as oral or intravenous administration and single or combined treatment; therefore, controversial findings were observed.

### Vitamin therapy in sepsis [^64d6be37]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Vitamins are essential micronutrients with key roles in many biological pathways relevant to sepsis. Some of these relevant biological mechanisms include antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, protein and hormone synthesis, energy generation, and regulation of gene transcription. Moreover, relative vitamin deficiencies in plasma are common during sepsis and vitamin therapy has been associated with improved outcomes in some adult and pediatric studies. High-dose intravenous vitamin C has been the vitamin therapy most extensively studied in adult patients with sepsis and septic shock. This includes three randomized control trials (RCTs) as monotherapy with a total of 219 patients showing significant reduction in organ dysfunction and lower mortality when compared to placebo, and five RCTs as a combination therapy with thiamine and hydrocortisone with a total of 1134 patients showing no difference in clinical outcomes. Likewise, the evidence for the role of other vitamins in sepsis remains mixed. In this narrative review, we present the preclinical, clinical, and safety evidence of the most studied vitamins in sepsis, including vitamin C, thiamine (i.e., vitamin B 1), and vitamin D. We also present the relevant evidence of the other vitamins that have been studied in sepsis and critical illness in both children and adults, including vitamins A, B 2, B 6, B 12, and E. IMPACT: Vitamins are key effectors in many biological processes relevant to sepsis. We present the preclinical, clinical, and safety evidence of the most studied vitamins in pediatric sepsis. Designing response-adaptive platform trials may help fill in knowledge gaps regarding vitamin use for critical illness and association with clinical outcomes.

### High dose intravenous vitamin C treatment in sepsis: associations with acute kidney injury and mortality [^be687a7d]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Clinical order set

In August 2016, a sepsis vitamin order set was formalized but not mandated in the hospital in which the study was completed. The decision to utilize the order set was up to the individual provider. The order panel included IV vitamin C at a dose of 1.5 g, administered every 6 h for a maximum of 16 doses; IV hydrocortisone 50 mg every 6 h up to 28 doses; and IV thiamine 200 mg every 12 h for 8 doses. In December 2018, melatonin 0.5 mg at bedtime was added to the order set with no stop required. The order panel did not include diagnostic studies to determine the severity of sepsis nor did it include treatment option directions based on clinical parameters.

Study design

This retrospective cohort study (Fig. 1) was conducted at a tertiary care, academic hospital and was approved by the Eastern Virginia Medical School Institutional Review Board. Adult patients, age 18 through 89 years, with International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10 code for "sepsis", admitted between August 1, 2016 and December 31, 2018, were identified via electronic health records (EHR-Epic Systems Corporation, Verona, WI, USA). Inclusion criteria included (1) admission via the ED, (2) hospitalization for at least 48 h, and (3) two serum creatinine assays 48 h apart. ED admission was required in order to capture patients with community acquired infections and limit those with sepsis after nosocomial infections, post-surgical sepsis, and transfer patients who may have missed the opportunity for early vitamin C therapy. These factors have been identified as potential confounders of treatment effectiveness, as nosocomial infections may be more likely to be drug resistant and more difficult to treat. Patients with admission glomerular filtration rates (GFR) less than 35 ml/min (measured by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula), an initial creatinine greater than 4.0 mg/dL (KDIGO Stage 3 disease), or a diagnosis of end stage kidney disease or prior kidney transplant were excluded from the study. This was done to allow for the temporal assessment of development of AKI and to prevent the inclusion of individuals with poor kidney function.

### Ascorbic acid in cancer treatment: let the Phoenix fly [^b867b822]. Cancer Cell (2018). Low credibility.

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid, ascorbate), despite controversy, has re-emerged as a promising anti-cancer agent. Recent knowledge of intravenous ascorbate pharmacokinetics and discovery of unexpected mechanisms of ascorbate action have spawned many investigations. Two mechanisms of anti-cancer activity with ascorbate have gained prominence: hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress and DNA demethylation mediated by ten-eleven translocation enzyme activation. Here, we highlight salient aspects of the evolution of ascorbate in cancer treatment, provide insights into the pharmacokinetics of ascorbate, describe mechanisms of its anti-cancer activity in relation to the pharmacokinetics, outline promising preclinical and clinical evidence, and recommend future directions.

### Intravenous vitamin C administration to patients with septic shock: a pilot randomised controlled trial [^2aab45c8]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations of this study. First, the size of the study was likely too small to detect the clinical outcomes. The sample size for the primary outcome of vasopressor requirements (dose and duration) was determined from the Iranian Zabet et al. trial. However, a subsequent meta-analysis of the effects of vitamin C on atrial fibrillation has indicated that trials carried out in Iran gave overly positive results compared with trials carried out in the US. This may be due to the populations of low-middle income countries tending to have lower vitamin C status and a higher prevalence of deficiency than those from high-income countries. Thus, higher participant numbers may be required to detect differences in cohorts from high-income countries who are not chronically insufficient in vitamin C. Another limitation may be the dose of vitamin C administered. At the time of ethics submission (2016), only two small vitamin C and sepsis RCTs had been published, the Fowler et al. trial (n = 24), which had administered 50 and 200 mg/kg/day vitamin C, and the Zabet et al. trial (n = 28) which had administered 100 mg/kg/day vitamin C. Because fewer patients had been treated with the higher dose of vitamin C, the ethics committee asked that we halve our vitamin C dose to 100 mg/kg/day due to safety concerns, despite evidence in other diseases states indicating tenfold higher doses being safe. Subsequent studies using vitamin C doses of 200 mg/kg/day and up to 25 g/day have shown potential effects on mortality in critically ill patients and an excellent safety profile. Of note, higher vitamin C doses may be required in septic patients due to potential downregulation of cellular vitamin C transporters in response to inflammatory mediators, thereby potentially attenuating cellular uptake of infused vitamin C. A further limitation was the length of time between ICU admission and initiation of intravenous vitamin C administration (median of ~ 18 h). Sepsis is a very time-sensitive condition, with earlier intervention being associated with better patient outcomes. A retrospective study of time sensitive mortality difference with vitamin C combination therapy indicated a significant decrease in mortality in participants who received the intervention within six hours of sepsis presentation relative to those who received it after more than six hours. Furthermore, the duration of vitamin C administration is an important consideration for long-term clinical outcomes, with intervention for five or more days showing greater benefit. Half of the intervention group in our trial did not receive the entire four days of intravenous vitamin C. Previous research has indicated that cessation of vitamin C infusions after 2–4 days can result in some patients reverting to hypovitaminosis C concentrations. Thus, overall, it appears that our dosing regimen may have been 'too little, too late' to see clinical benefits.

2.3 Clinical studies

In light of the anti‐cancer potential of vitamin C in cancer management, Phases I and II clinical trials reported favourable signatures of the safety and efficacy of vitamin C as combination therapy or even monotherapy in the treatment of various cancers. Clinical studies of vitamin C monotherapy in terminal cancer showed that a high dose of vitamin C, up to 3 g/kg, has no considerable safety issues. In line with pre‐clinical studies, several clinical studies have documented that vitamin C can provide long‐term survival for patients with cancer, even with terminal or metastatic cancer. However, no clinical studies have investigated the efficacy of vitamin C monotherapy in patients with late‐stage cancer without preceding treatment. The key difference in the outcomes is thought to be related to the route of administration and pharmacokinetics of vitamin C. Hoffer et al.designed a clinical trial study on end‐stage cancer and showed that no patient had a response to ascorbic acid. Besides, it was also demonstrated that high‐dose oral administration of vitamin C is successful in reducing the risk of development of gastrointestinal cancers, cervix, colorectal and breast cancer. Regarding oral administration of vitamin C, other studies revealed that daily intake of vitamin C is increased the survival of patients with breast cancer, which implies that vitamin C has a clinically beneficial antitumour effect regardless of the route of administration. Even though high‐dose intravenous administration of vitamin C is associated with alternative medical agents in cancer treatment, there is a lack of sufficient evidence regarding the clinical efficacy of the antitumour effect of vitamin C. Therefore, it is essential to design further clinical studies addressing the clinical efficacy of the anticancer effect of vitamin C to set up appropriate evidence for the clinical efficacy of vitamin C in practical guidelines.

Cancers can influence patients' quality of life, and vitamin C is shown to positively affect pain relief and well‐being. Moreover, vitamin deficiency is a common condition in patients with cancer, and anti‐neoplastic syndrome medications can also improve vitamin C deficiency and well‐being. Constitutional manifestations such as fatigue, depression, nausea, pain and loss of appetite are common in patients with cancer, and it was shown that intravenous administration of vitamin C reduces these complications and has palliative applications. Altogether, high‐dose vitamin C was shown to prolong the survival duration of patients, better performances and less pain compared to the control patients without receiving vitamin C.

### High dose intravenous vitamin C treatment in sepsis: associations with acute kidney injury and mortality [^f8c96ebc]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This retrospective study of patients hospitalized for sepsis revealed an association between IV vitamin C usage and subsequent AKI and in-hospital mortality. When examining the association of IV vitamin C therapy and AKI, the odds of experiencing AKI for individuals treated with IV vitamin C were 107% higher than the odds for individuals not treated with IV vitamin C, after controlling for a number of demographic and clinical variables. Findings also revealed that risk of AKI was increased for those who were male and older, which is supported in previous research. Findings are consistent with results from a similar study of patients admitted via the ED for sepsis, which found that individuals over 65 years were at significantly higher risk of AKI and subsequent in-hospital death. Other research has also highlighted the relationships between increased LOS and older age, and the occurrence of AKI and mortality. Other notable factors in the current study associated with increased risk of AKI were longer ICU LOS and identifying as black as compared to white, both of which are risk factors supported by previous research. The association between IV vitamin C and AKI is not unique to this study; a study by Litwak et al. observed a 12% increase in AKI in patients that received IV vitamin C but this did not reach statistical significance, likely due to small sample size. Additionally, this relationship between IV vitamin C and AKI has been identified in several case reports. The results from the current study differ from a large clinical trial (VICTAS) and a smaller retrospective study that found a beneficial relationship between IV vitamin C and AKI. The disparate results may also be explained by sample size and related power; the VICTAS study was ended earlier than planned and the retrospective study had a small sample size of only 47 patients.

### Reframing micronutrient deficiencies for modern times: a review [^14121788]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and Treatment

Plasma vitamin C levels are best evaluated after a fasting period as levels can be falsely normal or elevated after recent intake. One study suggests whole blood vitamin C levels to be preferable over plasma and urge caution in interpreting low results in the absence of clinical findings or when C-reactive protein is greater than > 5 mg/L. Functional assays such as leukocyte vitamin C are more reflective of body stores but not widely available.

It is important to note that most patients with deficient levels may not have the classic findings of scurvy. Plasma ascorbic acid or vitamin C levels between 11–28 µmol/L are considered marginal and may reflect biochemical deficiency before clinical signs are apparent. Such patients may quickly develop scurvy when subjected to a brief period of dietary changes. Overt symptoms of scurvy are more likely to be apparent when plasma levels are < 11 µmol/L.

Treatment doses will vary. A general regimen of 200mg intravenous ascorbic acid for 7 days is a preferred starting point. Doses as high as 2–3 g/day have been suggested depending on comorbidities such as critical illness, renal replacement therapies or malabsorption. Oral doses of 50mg-100mg may be sufficient in milder cases. Oral supplementation higher than 100mg is not absorbed well. High dose supplementation after repletion for prolonged period of time can lead to hyperoxaluria and kidney stones.

### Resuscitation with vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamin in children with septic shock: a multicenter randomized pilot study [^c5d78bba]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Interventions

Patients allocated to the vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamin group received 30 mg/kg/dose vitamin C (maximum 1,500 mg per dose as sodium ascorbate, Biological therapies) IV every 6 hours, hydrocortisone 1 mg/kg/dose (maximum 50 mg per dose) IV every 6 hours, and thiamin 4 mg/kg/dose (maximum 200 mg per dose) IV every 12 hours immediately after randomization. The dosing schedule has been shown to restore serum ascorbic acid concentrations in septic patients. The study treatment was administered for 7 days, until resolution of shock (defined as cessation of inotropes for at least 4 hr), death, discharge from the PICU, or if major adverse events related to the intervention occurred. Patients in the standard treatment arm were allowed to receive hydrocortisone only if the treating PICU staff specialist considered it clinically indicated. Other care in the PICU was provided according to the institutional practice.

Study Endpoints

The primary feasibility outcomes included recruitment rates, time to initiation of the intervention, proportion of patients receiving hydrocortisone outside the study protocol, and adherence to the study protocol.

The primary clinical efficacy outcome being assessed was defined as survival free of organ dysfunction censored at day 28 after randomization. Organ dysfunction was assessed daily using the pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA) score. Patients who died within 28 days of randomization were considered to have zero organ dysfunction-free days.

Secondary clinical efficacy outcomes being assessed included survival free of inotrope support at 7 days, survival free of multiple organ dysfunction at 7 days, mortality, PICU-free survival, survival free of acute kidney injury, and PICU and hospital length of stay. In addition, Pediatric Overall Performance Category (POPC) and Functional Status Score (FSS) were assessed at 28 days using phone or face-to-face interviews and compared with baseline scores. Baseline scores referred to "how was your child before this hospital admission" and were obtained with randomization. In addition, we assessed proxy measures of intervention efficacy including shock reversal, normalization of lactate (< 2 mmol/L), and time to reversal of tachycardia (defined by age-specific thresholds for Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome).

Adjunctive early sepsis therapies advise that "Routine corticosteroid therapy does not benefit sepsis patients unless there is concomitant adrenal insufficiency or the patient is on high-dose corticosteroid therapy for comorbid disease management prior to the onset of sepsis", and that "Other adjuncts, including angiotensin II (or analogs), vitamin C, vitamin D, and thiamine — alone or in combination — lack strong evidence supporting benefit and are not recommended". Patients with preexisting adrenal issues "should receive stress-dose hydrocortisone (50 to 100 mg intravenously)". Evidence summaries note that corticosteroids "may speed resolution of shock and shorten intensive care unit and hospital length of stay", but the authors state, "We believe that steroids may play a role in patients with hypotension resistant to vasopressor therapy, but that is uncertain; otherwise, the current data do not support routine use outside of adrenal failure or suppression or to treat another condition".

### Vitamin C revisited [^46c75001]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Role of vitamin C in ischemia/reperfusion and sepsis: human volunteers

In human volunteers, both ischemia/reperfusion injury (20 minutes of forearm ischemia) and low-dose LPS reduced plasma vitamin C concentrations and diminished acetylcholine-induced, endothelial-dependent vasodilatation. High-dose (24 mg/minute) intra-arterial vitamin C increased BH₄ concentrations, reduced neutrophil oxidative burst and completely restored the response to acetylcholine, but not to glyceryl-trinitrate (endothelium-independent dilatation), supporting its endothelial protective effect. Vitamin C also corrected the LPS-induced decreased responsiveness to norepinephrine and angiotensin II. Both vasopressors act independent of the endothelium, but their effect is blunted by oxidative stress and inflammation. These volunteer studies originate from the same group.

Several preclinical in vitro, animal and volunteer studies thus show that vitamin C in moderate to high doses can reduce ROS-induced microcirculatory flow impairment, microvascular leakage, decreased responsiveness to vasoconstrictors, and myocardial and other organ injury. Contradictory results in ischemia/reperfusion can partially be explained by the timing of administration, because vitamin C abrogates ischemic preconditioning. Furthermore, vitamin C reduces the overwhelming neutrophil response and inhibits bacterial replication.

### Chemical reactions of vitamin C with intravenous-iron formulations [^3e6dc60b]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Intravenous (IV) iron is widely prescribed for patients on haemodialysis, to replace iron losses during treatment. It releases labile iron, which can induce oxidation of vitamin C and trigger oxidant damage. We examined the stability of vitamin C in the presence of IV iron compounds. We further examined in the ability of vitamin C to release iron from these compounds.

Methods

Vitamin C was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Iron release from iron sucrose (FeSuc) and ferric gluconate (FeGlu) was determined with the ferrozine method.

Results

Vitamin C, in human plasma or fetal calf serum, was oxidized in this order of reactivity: FeSuc > FeGlu > blank reaction. FeSuc and FeGlu also oxidized vitamin C when added to freshly obtained whole human blood. During a 4 h incubation in buffer, vitamin C stimulated the release of 60% of the iron content of FeSuc at p 4, with lesser amounts at pH 3, 5 and 6, and 5% release at pH 7. Vitamin C also triggered the release of iron from FeGlu, but less release was observed than with FeSuc. Using ferrozine reagent, no iron release was detected to heparinized human plasma, following addition of 500 microM concentrations of iron compounds.

Conclusion

Each IV-iron compound can oxidize substantial amounts of vitamin C when added to plasma or whole blood. The interaction of vitamin C is accompanied by release of iron from the particle at mildly acidic pH, which may explain the ability of high-dose vitamin C to mobilize iron from storage sites for erythropoiesis.

### Unintended consequence of high-dose vitamin C therapy for an oncology patient: evaluation of ascorbic acid interference with three hospital-use glucose meters [^69478109]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2021). Medium credibility.

The use of high-dose vitamin C in cancer care has offered promising results for some patients. However, the intravenous (IV) doses used for these patients can reach concentrations that interfere with some strip-based glucose meters. We characterized the impact of vitamin C interference, from standard to the very high doses used for some cancer protocols, using three different hospital-use glucose meters. For two of the three devices tested, increasing concentrations of ascorbic acid caused false elevations in the glucose measurements. The third glucose meter did not provide inaccurate results, regardless of the vitamin C concentration present. Rather, above a certain threshold, the device generated error messages and no results could be obtained.

### Vitamin C in post-cardiac arrest (VITaCCA) [^e7dffb5e]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Vitamin C deficiency reduces the protection against oxidative stress. Intravenous supplementation is needed to restore deficiency and the antioxidative effect of vitamin C is much more potent if it is administered in a supraphysiological dose. Its strong antioxidative effect may reduce damage to the circulation and to brain, heart and other organs. Beneficial effects of high dose i. v. vitamin C after cardiac arrest have been demonstrated in preclinical studies, but not in patients. In critically ill patients, enteral supplementation even cannot restore deficiency due to the acutely increased requirements. Iv vitamin C administration generates much higher plasma levels, thus yielding more and more potent antioxidative effects. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are well elucidated.

High plasma levels of vitamin C not only limit the generation of reactive oxygen species, repair other oxidized scavengers such as glutathione and modulate numerous enzyme reactions, but can also act as a direct radical scavenger. clinical studies. Multiple preclinical experiments support the potential beneficial effect of high-dose iv vitamin C post cardiac arrest. In a rat cardiac arrest model vitamin C administration immediately after return of spontaneous circulation improved survival rate and neurological outcome and decreased myocardial damage. In organ-specific ischemia-reperfusion models of kidney, liver and skeletal muscle iv vitamin C ameliorated respectively renal structure and function, bile flow and cholate secretion and muscle function. Up to now no clinical study specifically addressed the post cardiac arrest population, but several controlled studies in critically ill patients showed favourable results.

In critically ill surgical patients 3 g iv vitamin C per day reduced pulmonary morbidity, new organ failure, duration of ICU/hospital stay and mortality. In burn patients very high dose iv vitamin reduced fluid requirements, body weight gain and respiratory dysfunction. In a recent pilot trial of patients with severe sepsis vitamin C both 50 mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day caused earlier recovery from organ failure with reduction of the pro-inflammatory biomarkers. In a before and after study of patients with septic shock high dose iv vitamin C combined with iv thiamine and stress dose steroids substantially accelerated shock reversal and improved survival. The investigators hypothesize that vitamin C reduces organ damage, especially cerebral injury, if administered for a short period as a high iv dose during the very early phase of reperfusion after cardiac arrest. Primary Objective:

- To determine whether an early high dose i. v.

vitamin C can improve organ function, especially neurological outcome, in patients after cardiac arrest.

### Vitamin C revisited [^d419c708]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Notably, concentrations attained with high oral dosing are sufficient to modulate enzymes such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate but not for scavenging O₂⁻, which reacts with NO at a rate 10⁵-fold greater than that with ascorbate. A plasma concentration of 10 mmol/l would be required to compete with NO and for complete restoration of NO bioavailability. High plasma concentrations can be obtained with intravenous administration. However, mild dietary supplementation of vitamin C reduced peroxynitrite formation and atrial electrophysiological remodeling induced by rapid pacing in dogs, probably due to higher intracellular vitamin C concentration.

High intravenous vitamin C doses, up to 3 to 6 g daily, are needed to restore normal plasma concentrations in critically ill patients. To attain plasma concentrations over 10 mmol/l for 3 hours, a short-term infusion of 30 to 100 g would be required. High pharmacological doses of vitamin C seem to be well tolerated. Prolonged oral intake of high-dose vitamin C increases the risk of oxalate kidney stones. However, this complication has not been reported with short-term high intravenous dosing. Of note, low dose ascorbate can also act as a pro-oxidant. However, after a 1 g vitamin C intravenous infusion, ascorbyl radical concentrations increased much more in healthy controls than in septic patients, who had a lower baseline concentration.

### Water-soluble vitamins in people with low glomerular filtration rate or on dialysis: a review [^d0010eb1]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

Extended Hours Dialysis

Vitamin C levels were lower in patients on extended hours hemodialysis (0.30 vs. 1.14 mg/dl, p < 0.001) with 7/26 patients (27%) in the extended hours group having levels less than 0.18 mg/dl and 16/26 (73%) having levels less than the lower limit of normal (0.48 mg/dl), compared with no patients in the conventional group. There was wide interindividual variation in vitamin C dose in this study; all patients received a multivitamin with 45 mg vitamin C, but a third of patients took additional vitamin C; mean dose in these patients was 151 mg/day.

B6 to Lower Oxalate

In a pre–post study of seven patients, vitamin B6 administration was temporally associated with a decline in serum oxalate levels in ascorbic acid-supplemented patients. B6 is a cofactor for glyoxalate conversion to glycine, reducing the substrate available for degradation into oxalate. To our knowledge, whether this might be clinically useful has not been further evaluated.

Multiple Pathways

Novel mechanistic insights into vitamin C in patients on dialysis are being elucidated. For example, high-dose vitamin C was shown to ameliorate dialysis-associated blood reactive oxygen species and total antioxidant score, decrease peroxidation of plasma lipid and red cell membranes, reduce hemolysis and levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Vitamin C administration also leads to shifts in several polypeptides identified in proteomic analysis from abnormal expression levels observed in patients on dialysis toward the expression levels seen in normal controls. Finally, in a randomized trial of vitamin C in patients with renal transplants, some, but not all, indices of vasomotor function were improved when assessed by intravascular ultrasound.

Treatment of Cramps

One trial compares the use of oral vitamin C 250 mg daily, vitamin E 400 mg daily, both, or placebo in the treatment of cramps, and showed a reduction of 61%, 54% and 97%, respectively, for the active treatment, compared with 7% for placebo. However, the concerns that cardiovascular events from systemic calcium oxalate deposition might increase, as discussed above, apply when considering whether to use vitamin C for this indication also.

Treatment of Iron Overload

In a small randomized trial of patients on hemodialysis with iron overload secondary to intravenous iron, vitamin C 200 mg iv three times weekly improved erythropoietin responsiveness more than desferrioxamine or controls, but did not lead to increases in iron loss or mobilization compared with either group.

### Targeting cancer vulnerabilities with high-dose vitamin C [^0b36f63e]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2019). High credibility.

Over the past century, the notion that vitamin C can be used to treat cancer has generated much controversy. However, new knowledge regarding the pharmacokinetic properties of vitamin C and recent high-profile preclinical studies have revived interest in the utilization of high-dose vitamin C for cancer treatment. Studies have shown that pharmacological vitamin C targets many of the mechanisms that cancer cells utilize for their survival and growth. In this Opinion article, we discuss how vitamin C can target three vulnerabilities many cancer cells share: redox imbalance, epigenetic reprogramming and oxygen-sensing regulation. Although the mechanisms and predictive biomarkers that we discuss need to be validated in well-controlled clinical trials, these new discoveries regarding the anticancer properties of vitamin C are promising to help identify patient populations that may benefit the most from high-dose vitamin C therapy, developing effective combination strategies and improving the overall design of future vitamin C clinical trials for various types of cancer.

### A review of guidelines on anticoagulation reversal across different clinical scenarios-is there a general consensus? [^da6974b2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

3.2.1.1. Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).

The European Stroke Organisation guideline recommends PCC at 30 IU/kg (along with vitamin K) for VKA reversal in ICH without distinguishing between 3- and 4-factor products. The Neurocritical Care Society and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (NCS/SCCM), recommend discontinuation of VKAs and administration of vitamin K at a dose of 10 mg intravenously (IV) in cases of ICH. Furthermore, these guidelines indicate the limited utility of FFP-based strategies in ICH due to the prolonged time to INR reversal, and acknowledge the low cost of FFP and its use in circumstances where PCCs are contraindicated (e.g. allergies or known adverse reaction to PCCs or their components). Treatment with FFP and vitamin K is recommended only if no other treatments are available. FFP should be administered at 10–20 mL/kg IV in combination with one dose of vitamin K 10 mg IV. The NCS/SCCM guidelines recommend 4F-PCC over 3F-PCC, with co-administration of vitamin K generally advised to ensure durable INR reversal. Initial reversal with PCCs alone rather than use in combination with FFP or recombinant Factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is also recommended. The dose of PCC should be weight-based and vary according to admission INR and type of PCC used.

Due to low-quality evidence and its association with thrombosis, rFVIIa is currently not recommended for VKA reversal in patients presenting with ICH (Table 2). Furthermore, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines state that although rFVIIa administration rapidly reduces INR, it may not restore thrombin generation effectively as it does not replenish all of the vitamin-K dependent factors.

Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) for pediatric septic shock or sepsis-associated organ dysfunction — we suggest against the use of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in the treatment of children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Adults with sepsis often have very low vitamin C (88% of adults with septic shock had hypovitaminosis C), and combination therapy with thiamine and corticosteroids in 47 adults was associated with decreased hospital mortality (OR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.04–0.48), but there are currently no data on vitamin C use or supplementation in critically ill children with sepsis.

### Vitamin C as a cardioprotective agent against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity [^4f7fe62b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Sources of Clinical Heterogeneity

Although the cardioprotective research on vitamin C has revealed promise, clinical trials in humans have shown inconsistent results compared with preclinical research. Such heterogeneity between preclinical and clinical outcomes has been attributed to dosing (oral, intravenous, and pharmacologic, as well as dietary levels), administration timing (before, during, or after chemotherapy) and patient‐specific factors (baseline antioxidant levels, tumor type, metabolic environment, and genetics).

Vitamin C pharmacokinetics differ sharply between administration routes, creating substantial clinical variability. Oral dosing relies on specialized gut transporter proteins (ie, SVCT‐1 [sodium‐dependent vitamin C transporter 1]) and once saturated, no additional vitamin C crosses, irrespective of the dosage. Thus, even large oral dosing strategies of 3 g have been shown to modestly raise blood vitamin C levels to approximately 70 to 80 μmol/L before plateauing. By contrast, intravenous administration bypasses the gut, delivering vitamin C directly into the bloodstream and achieving plasma concentrations in the millimolar range, nearly 50‐fold higher than oral approaches.

Many laboratory models require superphysiological dosages to see the pro‐oxidant or cytotoxic effects on cancer cells, which cannot be achieved via oral supplementation due to intestinal and renal regulation. Heaney et al showed in vitro that preloading cancer cells (K562 and human B‐cell lymphoma cell line) with DHA at pharmacologic levels led to rapid, dose‐dependent intracellular accumulation of vitamin C, providing protection against chemotherapeutic cytotoxicity. These in vitro results revealed that cancer cells take up DHA via GLUT1 (glucose transporter 1) transporters and convert DHA to ascorbate intracellularly. This uptake revealed resistance to multiple chemotherapies by preserving mitochondrial membrane potential and reducing apoptosis. In the same study, a severe combined immunodeficiency mouse human B‐cell lymphoma cell line xenograft model confirmed that these intracellular protective mechanisms reduced chemotherapy efficacy. Administration of DHA intravenously 2 hours before doxorubicin treatment showed tumors that were 4 times larger than doxorubicin alone, even though intratumor doxorubicin levels were nearly identical. This suggests the protection was not due to altered drug pharmacokinetics or delivery but rather a function of intracellular protective effects (ie, mitochondrial membrane potential), as was observed in vitro. Thus, administering vitamin C before, during, or after chemotherapy may shape its influence on treatment response.

### Ascorbate-dependent vasopressor synthesis: a rationale for vitamin C administration in severe sepsis and septic shock? [^4006e483]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Ascorbate requirements in sepsis

Ascorbate is an essential micronutrient with numerous important enzyme cofactor functions in the body, as well as potent antioxidant properties. Humans have lost the ability to synthesise ascorbate due to mutations in the gene encoding the terminal biosynthetic enzyme, and ascorbate must therefore be obtained regularly through the diet to prevent hypovitaminosis C and the potentially fatal deficiency disease scurvy. Recommended dietary intakes for ascorbate are typically in the range of 75–110 mg/day. Enteral or parenteral nutrition administered to critically ill patients provides ~100 mg/day ascorbate. However, critically ill patients probably require significantly higher intakes of ascorbate due to enhanced metabolic turnover of vitamin C during the severe inflammatory response. It should also be noted that parenteral rather than enteral nutrition may be required for optimal ascorbate status in critically ill patients because intravenously administered ascorbate bypasses the rate-limiting intestinal uptake of orally administered ascorbate.

In healthy fasting humans, circulating levels of ascorbate are typically in the range of 50–70 μmol/l, whereas levels < 23 μmol/l are considered marginally deficient (or hypovitaminosis C) and levels < 11 μmol/l are considered severely deficient and potentially scorbutic. Several studies have shown that ascorbate levels are low in critically ill patients (i.e. < 23 μmol/l), including those with acute respiratory infections and sepsis, and are particularly low (i.e. < 11 μmol/l) in patients who progress to multiple organ failure. In some studies, ascorbate levels remained lower than those in controls, despite the patients receiving 100–500 mg/day ascorbate either enterally or parenterally. Long et al. demonstrated that up to 3000 mg/day ascorbate was required to return plasma levels of critically ill patients to normal (i.e. 68 μmol/l).

### The 2023 WSES guidelines on the management of trauma in elderly and frail patients [^def68a57]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

However, it is recommended as an adjunct treatment in these patients at the dosage of 5–10 mg administered intravenously. In cases of bleeding, vitamin K administration helps replete stores of clotting factors II, IV, IX, and X, thereby increasing the speed of reversal and reducing the INR over 4 h to 6 h for IV infusion and up to 24 h for oral administration. When emergent reversal is required, IV vitamin K should be given with PCC or FFP to prevent rebound because FFP's half-life is 4 h to 6 h whereas the half-life of PCC is dependent on the clotting factors present, ranging from 4 h for factor VII to 60 h for factor II.

A rare and unpredictable but important side effect of intravenous vitamin K is an anaphylactic reaction, in some cases resulting in cardiac arrest, with an incidence of 3 per 100,000 doses via a non-immunoglobulin E (IgE) mechanism, possibly due to the solubiliser in the vitamin K solution. "Overcorrection" of warfarin reversal with additional PCC and vitamin K1 can lead to harm. More than 10 mg vitamin K1 can prevent re-warfarinisation for days and over use of PCC (administration of further PCC when INR is in the normal range) may create a prothrombotic state, which could lead to further thrombosis.

Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) is a hemostatic agent that increases thrombin generation by activating factor X at the site of vascular injury. It should not be used as a single agent to reversal because it is usually not capable of restoring hemostasis. Limited evidence exists regarding the use of rFVIIa for reversal of VKA-related hemorrhage. The actual recommendation is not to use rFVIIa for warfarin reversal unless no other option is available, or in case of failure with previous treatments. Data from a literature review show that the use of rFVIIa as a prothrombotic agent could result in an increased risk of thromboembolic events, especially in elderly patients and when used for off-label indications such as the reversal of anticoagulant agents.

Vitamin C monitoring and evaluation in CKD emphasizes oxalate risk and surveillance of lipids: Higher doses of vitamin C supplementation (500 mg daily) have been shown to increase serum oxalate levels, and measurement of serum oxalate may be considered in patients prescribed high doses of vitamin C and/or who are susceptible to calcium oxalate stone formation; lipid metabolism may be affected and patients receiving vitamin C supplementation should have lipid fractions monitored, with dosing that takes into consideration medical history, comorbid conditions, and concomitant medications, noting that patients with malabsorption or inflammatory diseases may have lower plasma vitamin C levels than the general population.

### High-dose parenteral ascorbate enhanced chemosensitivity of ovarian cancer and reduced toxicity of chemotherapy [^7a3e2c64]. Science Translational Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Ascorbate (vitamin C) was an early, unorthodox therapy for cancer, with an outstanding safety profile and anecdotal clinical benefit. Because oral ascorbate was ineffective in two cancer clinical trials, ascorbate was abandoned by conventional oncology but continued to be used in complementary and alternative medicine. Recent studies provide rationale for reexamining ascorbate treatment. Because of marked pharmacokinetic differences, intravenous, but not oral, ascorbate produces millimolar concentrations both in blood and in tissues, killing cancer cells without harming normal tissues. In the interstitial fluid surrounding tumor cells, millimolar concentrations of ascorbate exert local pro-oxidant effects by mediating hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) formation, which kills cancer cells. We investigated downstream mechanisms of ascorbate-induced cell death. Data show that millimolar ascorbate, acting as a pro-oxidant, induced DNA damage and depleted cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), activated the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, and resulted in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition and death in ovarian cancer cells. The combination of parenteral ascorbate with the conventional chemotherapeutic agents carboplatin and paclitaxel synergistically inhibited ovarian cancer in mouse models and reduced chemotherapy-associated toxicity in patients with ovarian cancer. On the basis of its potential benefit and minimal toxicity, examination of intravenous ascorbate in combination with standard chemotherapy is justified in larger clinical trials.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^9dd8c36d]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — management of iron supplementation notes that although no formal recommendation is provided, clinicians should recognize available oral and intravenous formulations with varying costs and side effects, and in most patients an initial trial of oral supplementation should be given as it is generally effective, available, inexpensive, and safe. There is no strong evidence that any of the available oral formulations is more effective or better tolerated than the others. Historically, a daily dose of 150–200 mg of elemental iron has been recommended, but some studies suggest that lower dosing or every-other-day dosing may improve tolerability and absorption. Taking iron supplements with food or using enteric-coated formulations may improve tolerability but decrease absorption, and vitamin C co-administration is commonly recommended as it enhances absorption and may improve response to oral iron. If such a response is not seen, assessment for nonadherence (due to side effects or other reasons), malabsorption, or ongoing blood loss exceeding iron intake is needed. Intravenous iron may be appropriate in selected patients, such as those with impaired absorption due to prior gastric surgery, with inflammatory bowel disease or chronic kidney disease, or in whom blood loss exceeds the ability to replete iron orally, and consultation with a hematologist is often helpful when intravenous iron repletion is required.

### Vitamin C revisited [^05f6aafc]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Plasma concentrations, dose and pharmacokinetics of vitamin C: patients

Plasma concentrations

Vitamin C plasma concentrations depend on absorption, the distribution volume, cellular uptake, consumption and renal reabsorption and excretion. Patients with sepsis, hemorrhage, multiple organ failure, stroke, traumatic brain injury or after cardiac surgery have low vitamin C concentrations in plasma and leukocytes, probably due to increased consumption in the cell and high leukocyte turnover. Since intracellular ascorbate concentrations in mononuclear leucocytes and in granulocytes are respectively 80 and 25 times higher than in plasma, a high production and turnover of these cells contributes to depletion. Low plasma concentrations correlate with inflammation (C-reactive protein) and multiple organ failure, suggesting consumption during oxidative stress.

Dosing

Recommended doses of vitamins are generally based on preventing deficiency in healthy humans. In healthy volunteers, manifestations of vitamin C deficiency (fatigue and/or irritability) occurred at plasma concentrations below 20 μmol/l. Clear scurvy can develop below 11 μmol/l. With sufficient vitamin C intake (100 to 300 mg/day), plasma concentrations plateau at 70 to 85 μmol/l and do not exceed 220 μmol/l at maximal oral intake (3 g six times daily). Oral dose is limited by intestinal absorption and high oral intake causes diarrhea. Urinary excretion depends on the plasma concentration and is minimal at low plasma concentrations due to active tubular reabsorption. Threshold plasma concentration for excretion may be 55 μmol/l.

Ascorbate is transported into the cell by ascorbate-specific membrane transporters and less so as dehydroascorbic acid via glucose transporters. Within the cell, dehydroascorbic acid can be rapidly reduced to ascorbate, thereby recycling ascorbate. The ascorbate transporter SVCT1 is expressed predominantly in epithelial tissues such as the intestine and kidney, maintaining optimal vitamin C concentrations in the body. The ascorbate transporter SVCT2 delivers ascorbic acid to tissues. Immune and inflammatory cells have intracellular concentrations 10 to 80 times higher than plasma, protecting them against ROS generated by respiratory burst or phagocytosis. Neurons have concentrations as high as 10 mmol/l, sufficient for scavenging O₂⁻. Of note, ascorbate does not pass the blood–brain barrier. However, dehydroascorbic acid does so via the glucose transporter GLUT1 and is reduced to ascorbate after uptake in neurons. Intravenous administration of dehydroascorbic acid confers supraphysiologic concentrations of ascorbate in the brain.

### Nutrition: a non-negligible factor in the pathogenesis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease [^446e8861]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Retinoic acid, the most potent form of vitamin A, induces hippocampal neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation, rescues vitamin A deficiency–induced spatial memory impairment, and reverses age‐related memory deficits. Besides the mechanistic evidence supporting a vitamin A–mediated role in cognition, clinical research also supports the role of β‐carotene in favorably influencing cognition as a vitamin A precursor (Table 1). Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, is a potent antioxidant that plays an essential neuroprotective role, which not only relies on the inhibition of oxidative and inflammatory pathways, but also on the chelation of iron, copper, and zinc, and on the suppression of Aβ fibrillogenesis (Table 1).

Therefore, considering the undeniable roles of vitamins in antioxidation, anti‐inflammation, and regulation of the gut microbiota, vitamins are a potential multi‐target therapeutic approach for the prevention and treatment of AD. Evidence‐based medical recommendations have affirmed the vital role of vitamin supplementation in preventing AD and improving cognitive impairment. Further research is warranted to explore the optimal dose and timing of these micronutrient supplements to facilitate clinical application.

Vitamin K for vitamin K antagonist (VKA) reversal — route, dose, and safety are described as follows: reversal is expedited with the intravenous route, and administration of Vitamin K as a single, large dose (10 mg IV) is preferred over divided dosing. Anaphylactoid reactions are more common with intravenous administration; however, the incidence is only 3 per 10,000 doses, and reducing the infusion rate may reduce the risk, although this is controversial.
