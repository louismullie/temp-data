## Question

A 2860-g (6-lb 3-oz) male newborn is born at term to a primigravid woman via spontaneous vaginal delivery. The mother has had no routine prenatal care. She reports that there is no family history of serious illness. The initial examination of the newborn shows bowing of the legs and respiratory distress upon palpation of the chest. The skin and joints are hyperextensible. X-rays of the chest and skull show multiple rib fractures and small, irregular bones along the cranial sutures. The patient is at increased risk of which of the following complications?
A. Costochondral junction enlargement
B. Intestinal rupture
C. Spinal canal stenosis
D. Hearing loss

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which complication is most likely in a newborn presenting with multiple rib fractures, wormian bones, and hyperextensible skin, and is choosing among costochondral junction enlargement, intestinal rupture, spinal canal stenosis, or hearing loss. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis from the clinical and radiographic phenotype. Then, I should verify the extraskeletal complications that commonly accompany that diagnosis. Next, I will examine each answer option against the expected disease course and prevalence data. Finally, I will double-check for any confounders that could mislead the choice and confirm the best-supported answer.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis. Multiple rib fractures, wormian bones along cranial sutures, and hyperextensible skin in a newborn strongly suggest osteogenesis imperfecta, particularly a severe perinatal-onset type such as type II or type III, given the combination of bone fragility, osteopenia, and connective tissue laxity. The respiratory distress fits with a small thorax and rib fractures limiting ventilation, which is well described in severe OI [^115V4HBN] [^111LW3Zs] [^112aqosp] [^112JL9M8].

> Wait, let me verify the extraskeletal manifestations that typically co-occur. OI is a systemic collagenopathy with frequent extraskeletal features including blue sclerae, dentinogenesis imperfecta, joint hypermobility, and importantly, hearing loss due to abnormalities of the middle ear ossicles and inner ear structures; early hypoacusia is repeatedly cited in radiologic and clinical reviews of OI, and large cohorts document hearing deficit as a recognized non-skeletal feature, supporting its relevance across the severity spectrum [^112aqosp] [^114pDPMf] [^113AbA6T].

> I will now examine each option against this background. Costochondral junction enlargement, sometimes termed a "rachitic rosary", is classically associated with rickets rather than OI; I initially wondered if OI could mimic this, but hold on, I should verify — OI does not produce the metaphyseal widening and costochondral beading of rickets, so this would be an atypical and misleading finding in OI, making option A unlikely here [^111vsPD3].

> Next, I should review intestinal rupture. While certain connective tissue disorders like vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome carry a risk of hollow organ rupture, that specific complication is not a recognized feature of classic OI. OI's extraskeletal risks are more aligned with hearing loss, dentinogenesis imperfecta, and cardiovascular issues rather than spontaneous intestinal perforation, so option B does not fit the expected OI phenotype [^113dCzsV] [^113dCzsV].

> Let me consider spinal canal stenosis. Severe OI can cause progressive spinal deformity, vertebral fractures, and scoliosis, but frank developmental spinal canal stenosis is not a typical primary complication of OI; spinal stenosis is more characteristic of degenerative or achondroplastic etiologies, so while spinal problems are expected in OI, option C overstates a specific anatomic complication that is not a hallmark of OI [^117KBxq2] [^114pDPMf].

> Now, hearing loss. I should double-check prevalence and timing. Hearing impairment is repeatedly listed among common extraskeletal manifestations of OI, including conductive and mixed patterns, and it can present in infancy or progress over time; given the systemic collagen involvement in the middle and inner ear, and the documented presence across cohorts, hearing loss is the most consistent and expected long-term complication among the choices provided for a child with OI [^112aqosp] [^114pDPMf] [^113AbA6T].

> But wait, what if the hyperextensible skin points away from OI toward Ehlers-Danlos syndrome? Could that change the answer? Hold on, I should verify — joint hypermobility and skin changes can be seen in OI due to type I collagen involvement in ligaments and skin, and the constellation of multiple neonatal rib fractures with wormian bones remains pathognomonic for OI rather than EDS; thus, even with hyperextensibility, the safest, reference-supported complication to anticipate in OI is hearing loss, not EDS-specific visceral rupture [^117KBxq2] [^112aqosp].

> Final check and conclusion: the phenotype fits severe OI, the extraskeletal complication consistently documented in OI is hearing loss, and the other options either reflect different diseases or are not typical of OI. Therefore, the most likely complication is hearing loss, corresponding to option D [^117KBxq2] [^112aqosp] [^114pDPMf].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)**, given the combination of bone fragility, multiple rib fractures, Wormian bones, and hyperextensible joints. The patient is at **increased risk of hearing loss** due to abnormal ossicle development and conductive impairment from repeated fractures and deformities [^117KBxq2] [^114pDPMf]. Hearing loss is a recognized complication in OI and is the most appropriate answer among the options provided [^112aqosp].

---

## Clinical features supporting osteogenesis imperfecta

- **Bone fragility and fractures**: Multiple rib fractures and bowing of the long bones are classic features of OI, particularly in severe forms such as type II or III [^116JLb7w] [^112JL9M8].

- **Wormian bones**: Small, irregular bones along the cranial sutures are characteristic radiographic findings in OI, particularly in the lambdoid sutures [^111LW3Zs].

- **Hyperextensible joints**: Joint laxity and hypermobility are common extraskeletal manifestations of OI, reflecting generalized connective tissue abnormalities [^112aqosp].

- **Respiratory distress**: Rib fractures and chest wall deformities can lead to respiratory complications, including respiratory distress, particularly in severe forms of OI [^115V4HBN].

---

## Complications of osteogenesis imperfecta

OI is associated with numerous complications, including skeletal deformities, growth impairment, and extraskeletal manifestations. Among the options provided, **hearing loss** is a well-documented complication of OI, resulting from abnormal ossicle development and conductive impairment from repeated fractures and deformities [^117KBxq2] [^114pDPMf].

---

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Clinical relevance to oi** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Costochondral junction enlargement | Not specific to OI | Costochondral junction enlargement, also known as the rachitic rosary, is characteristic of rickets and other metabolic bone diseases, not OI [^111vsPD3]. |
| B. Intestinal rupture | Not specific to OI | Intestinal rupture is not a recognized complication of OI. It is more commonly associated with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS), a different connective tissue disorder [^notfound]. |
| C. Spinal canal stenosis | Rare in OI | While spinal deformities and scoliosis are common in OI, spinal canal stenosis is not a typical complication. It is more commonly associated with degenerative conditions or other skeletal dysplasias. |
| D. Hearing loss | Highly specific to OI | Hearing loss is a well-documented complication of OI, resulting from abnormal ossicle development and conductive impairment from repeated fractures and deformities [^117KBxq2] [^114pDPMf]. |

---

## Conclusion

The patient described in the vignette most likely has osteogenesis imperfecta, and among the provided options, **hearing loss** is the most appropriate answer. It is a recognized complication of OI, whereas the other options are either not specific to OI or are not typical complications of the condition [^117KBxq2] [^114pDPMf].

Differential diagnosis of OI

A positive diagnosis of OI can be difficult, particularly in young children (before the age of 2 years) with mild forms of OI (types I, IV) and when there are few or no obvious extraskeletal manifestations and no familial history of increased bone fragility. These cases of OI may be tragically mistaken for NAI. Indeed, in both OI and NAI, unexplained, multiple and repeated fractures may occur; children may present with bruises and contusions; radiographs may reveal different types of fractures, fractures of various ages that went undetected and no evidence of osteopenia. A thorough radiographic examination, including a skeletal survey, can help differentiate between OI and NAI (Table 2). In NAI, some fractures are very suggestive of abuse (i.e. posterior rib fractures, metaphyseal corner fractures and complex skull fractures).

Posterior rib fractures

Rib fractures usually result from anteroposterior compression of the rib cage when the child is held around the chest and violently shaken back and forth. The posterior involvement is due to excessive leverage of the posteromedial part of the rib over the transverse process of the spine and is highly specific of abuse. In this situation, posterior rib fractures are frequently multiple on radiographs and are often associated with callus formation when discovered (Fig. 21).

Blunt chest trauma — screening chest radiograph evaluation — should include identifying pneumothorax or hemothorax, noting pulmonary infiltrates suggesting contusions or aspiration, evaluating the diaphragms for direct injury or elevation due to abdominal pathology, identifying fractures of the ribs, clavicles, scapulae, and humeri, and checking alignment of the thoracic and upper lumbar vertebrae. Fractures on the initial screening chest radiograph provide important clues to energy transfer, with rib fractures providing clear evidence of thoracic and torso trauma, association of the number of fractures with morbidity and mortality, and the presence of any rib fracture increasing the likelihood of intraabdominal injuries.

### Unexplained fractures: child abuse or bone disease? A systematic review [^113vZkYm]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

The condition that was most frequently mistaken for CAN was OI, although one additional included article examined metaphyseal dysplasias. The most common form of OI mistaken for CAN was Silence Type IV. With the information as to what general condition (OI and a specific type) most commonly mimics CAN, it would seem logical that these readily distinguishable history, physical examination, and imaging characteristics can aid in making the proper diagnosis. However, patients with OI who were mistakenly considered victims of CAN had a wide range of history, physical examination, and radiographic findings, particularly for features considered "typical" for OI. In fact, patients in our series with OI who were wrongly diagnosed with CAN lacked "classic" osteopenia and wormian bones. This could potentially explain why these patients' caretakers were wrongly accused of CAN.

The difficulty in diagnosing OI may stem from the fact that fracture patterns in the patients with OI did not differ from those in patients with CAN. From papers presenting fracture data in our review, femur fractures were the most common (66.6%) in patients with OI followed by tibia (33.3%), humerus (29.6%), and rib fractures (14.8%). In addition, in 70.3% of cases, patients with OI had multiple fractures or radiographic evidence of old fractures on presentation. This is similar to data presented in prior studies in patients younger than 18 months; the odds of rib, tibia/fibula, humerus, and femur fracture are higher in patients with CAN, and multiple fractures and fractures in multiple stages of healing are indicative of CAN. Furthermore, Steiner et al. observed no difference between patients with OI (33%) and those with CAN (39%) in terms of the presence of fractures with a "high" specificity for abuse (ie, metaphyseal, posterior rib, scapular, spinous process, or sternal fractures) or for fractures with a "moderate" specificity for abuse as outlined by the authors.

### Osteogenesis imperfecta [^117KBxq2]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Skeletal deformity and bone fragility are the hallmarks of the brittle bone dysplasia osteogenesis imperfecta. The diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta usually depends on family history and clinical presentation characterized by a fracture (or fractures) during the prenatal period, at birth or in early childhood; genetic tests can confirm diagnosis. Osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by dominant autosomal mutations in the type I collagen coding genes (COL1A1 and COL1A2) in about 85% of individuals, affecting collagen quantity or structure. In the past decade, (mostly) recessive, dominant and X-linked defects in a wide variety of genes encoding proteins involved in type I collagen synthesis, processing, secretion and post-translational modification, as well as in proteins that regulate the differentiation and activity of bone-forming cells have been shown to cause osteogenesis imperfecta. The large number of causative genes has complicated the classic classification of the disease, and although a new genetic classification system is widely used, it is still debated. Phenotypic manifestations in many organs, in addition to bone, are reported, such as abnormalities in the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems, skin fragility, muscle weakness, hearing loss and dentinogenesis imperfecta. Management involves surgical and medical treatment of skeletal abnormalities, and treatment of other complications. More innovative approaches based on gene and cell therapy, and signalling pathway alterations, are under investigation.

### Histological ageing of fractures in infants: a practical algorithm for assessing infants suspected of accidental or non-accidental injury [^117DDhTe]. Histopathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recognition of fractures in life and at autopsy is a key element in the assessment of infants believed to have suffered accidental or non‐accidental injury. 1

Radiological skeletal survey (SS) is the current method of choice in detecting fractures in life. 2 Follow‐up SS increases the likelihood of fracture detection in live children, 2, 3 but as progressive healing does not occur post‐mortem, radiological detection of recent fractures post‐mortem is more challenging, 4 although more sensitive techniques that require doses of radiation that could not be given to live infants [e.g. whole‐body computerised tomography (CT)] can be employed. 2, 5 However, while radiology detects overt and unsuspected fractures in dead infants, many may be missed. 6, 7, 8, 9 Significantly, it is fractures that most closely correlate with NAI (e.g. posterior rib and metaphyseal) that are commonly missed. 10, 11, 12 Further evidence of fracture can be obtained at autopsy, 9, 13 but naked eye examination also misses key fractures.

Part of the full investigation of fractures detected/suspected at autopsy is histological examination of the bone in order to:
decide if bone injury has occurred;
age fractures relative to the time of death; and
determine whether there is an abnormality of the bone (e.g. osteogenesis imperfecta, osteoporosis, vitamin D deficiency) that might make bones more easily fractured.

It is accepted that post‐mortem histological examination of infant bones can detect fractures not seen radiologically. 9, 11, 13, 14 Optimising detection of fractures is key, as multiple fractures and fractures of certain bones/parts of bones (e.g. posterior ribs, limb bone metaphyses) carry a high correlation with NAI and have causational implications. 10, 12, 14, 15, 16 The causational significance of demonstrating fracture types is well reported, 11, 14, 17 and we recently demonstrated 13 how routine sampling of apparently unfractured bones might disclose key, unsuspected fractures.

### Fractures at diagnosis in infants and children with osteogenesis imperfecta [^113aw5Dx]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In infants and children with fractures from an unclear cause, osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is often included as a potential etiology. In infants and children with OI there exists a gap in the published literature regarding the fracture pattern seen at the time of diagnosis. As an additional aid to the diagnosis of OI, we sought to characterize the fracture patterns in infants and children at the time of their diagnosis.

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of a series of infants and children under 18 years of age who have the diagnosis of OI (any type) from a single institution.

Results

We identified 68 infants and children with OI: 23 (34%) type 1, 1 (2%) type 2, 17 (25%) type 3, 24 (35%) type 4, and 3 (4%) unknown type. A family history of OI was present in 46% of children. Forty-nine (72.0%) patients were diagnosed solely on clinical characteristics, without genetic or fibroblast confirmation. Rib fractures were noted in 21% of the subjects with none being identified during infancy. The number of fractures identified at diagnosis ranged from 1 to > 37 with 7 (10%) having more than 2 fractures. All subjects with more than 2 fractures were diagnosed prenatally or in the immediate newborn period. Seventeen (25%) infants were diagnosed after 1 week of age but before 12 months of age. None of these infants had either rib fractures or more than 1 fracture at the time of diagnosis.

Conclusions

The majority of children diagnosed with OI are diagnosed by clinical features alone. The fracture pattern at the time of diagnosis in OI is variable with 10% having more than 2 fractures. The diagnosis of OI was made in utero or at delivery in 43% of children. Multiple rib fractures in an infant would be an unexpected finding in OI.

Radiographic Indications

Similar to clinical indications, the most common radiographic signs that were associated with physical child abuse were related to head injury. Only one article found that subdural hemorrhage was not significantly associated with physical abuse. This is consistent with previous literature that states skull fractures account for up to 30% of all fractures in abused children. Similar to head injuries, a consensus was reached on both upper and lower extremity fractures as a radiographic indicator: three articles mentioned upper extremity fractures, two articles mentioned other lower extremity fractures, and three articles mentioned long bone fractures related to the lower extremity. All articles cited significant findings for upper, lower, and long bone fractures. A previous systematic review looking into patterns of skeletal fractures by Kemp et alrelated these types of fractures to physical child abuse as well. This is also consistent with previous studies reporting fracture of the shaft of the long bones is the most common skeletal injury in abused children.

For radiographic signs related to thoracic and lung injuries, there was a relative paucity of studies related to these types of injuries. Our search found only one article regarding pulmonary injuries and physical child abuse and no studies related to thoracic injuries. Specifically of note, no articles included in this study found an association between rib fractures and physical child abuse. It is possible that our strict inclusion and exclusion criteria excluded some of the articles reporting rib fractures if the data on those injuries were not specifically stratified by physical abuse alone. In contrast to these findings, other systematic reviews have found that the presence of multiple rib fractures is most common among abused patients rather than nonabused patients. Similarly, there are two other radiographic signs that are commonly associated with physical child abuse but were not discussed in the articles included in this systematic review. These signs are classic metaphyseal lesions and fractures in various stages of healing. Classic metaphyseal lesions, which is a separation of the metaphyseal corner, demonstrate the highest specificity in children younger than 1 year. Similarly, fractures in various stages of healing were reported to be present in at least 70% of abused children in the first year of life. These two signs are often reported to have an association with child abuse in general, not specifically physical abuse, which likely explains why this study did not find them significant. Given this, this study identifies specific indicators found to be associated with physical child abuse but does not present assertions that other indicators are not also associated with physical child abuse.

### Thoracic cage injuries [^1119aRQq]. European Journal of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rib fractures are the most common form of blunt thoracic injury. Multiple rib fractures are an important indicator of trauma severity, with increased morbidity and mortality occurring with increasing numbers of rib fractures, especially in the elderly. Thoracic cage injuries may be associated with concomitant and potentially life-threating injuries. In the acute setting, correct recognition of the pattern, extent and severity of thoracic cage injuries, may aid in more accurate delineation of concomitant injuries.

### Clinical and molecular features of 66 patients with musculocontractural Ehlers-Danlos syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in (mcEDS-) [^1151pUUz]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

This is the first attempt to evaluate clinical difference statistically between mcEDS- CHST14 and mcEDS- DSE. Core skin features (hyperextensibility, bruisability, fragility and atrophic scars) were significantly more frequent in mcEDS- CHST14. An ultrastructural study of skin samples from patients with mcEDS- CHST14 demonstrated that dermal collagen fibrils were dispersed, which were caused by the conformationally linear CS chains stretching from the outer surface of collagen fibrils to adjacent fibrils. On the other hand, collagen fibrils of healthy control samples were regularly and tightly assembled, which were associated with DS chains that were round and wrapping collagen fibrils. This spatial disorganisation of collagen networks, presumably related to a complete compositional change from DS to CS in GAG chains, was suggested to disrupt the ring-mesh structure of GAG side chains surrounding collagen fibrils and result in marked skin hyperextensibility and fragility. The mcEDS- DSE represents milder phenotypes compared with mcEDS- CHST14, and partially synthesised DS in the affected skin fibroblasts might be related to the residual DSE activity or compensation by DSE2 encoded by DSE-like (DSEL) that is a homologue of DSE. Since the number of reported patients with mcEDS- DSE is small and longitudinal data are limited at present, more accurate and comprehensive phenotypic comparison between mcEDS- CHST14 and mcEDS- DSE remains to be clarified.

Inevitable limitation could exist as a retrospective survey on an extremely rare disorder, including a possible incomplete dataset of features and complications based on the absence of a surveillance guideline as well as a possibility of recall bias especially for features and complications in the early childhood of older patients. However, this study would present the most accurate, detailed and comprehensive clinical information that could be obtained at present through a multiple data collection strategy (questionnaires, medical records and literatures) based on a unified clinical information file.

In conclusion, this first international collaborative study offers further delineation of clinical and molecular features in mcEDS- CHST14. Unique, multisystemic clinical manifestations, more severe than those for mcEDS- DSE, require lifelong, multidisciplinary healthcare. The pathophysiology of this syndrome is gradually being elucidated, and future aetiology-based therapies such as adeno-associated virus-based gene therapy and chaperone therapy might be expected.

### Clinical and molecular features of 66 patients with musculocontractural Ehlers-Danlos syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in (mcEDS-) [^112e9yw8]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Dysfunction of D4ST1 or DSE causes a depletion of DS, completely replaced by chondroitin sulfate (CS) in affected skin fibroblasts, and especially in the GAG chains of decorin, a major DS-proteoglycan that contributes to collagen fibril assembly. The ultrastructure of skin samples from patients with mcEDS- CHST14 included dispersed dermal collagen fibrils, resulting from the conformationally linear CS chains stretching from the outer surface of collagen fibrils to adjacent fibrils; in contrast to regularly and tightly assembled collagen fibrils of healthy control samples, according to DS chains that were round and wrapping collagen fibrils. This spatial disorganisation of collagen networks is suggested to disrupt the ring-mesh structure of GAG side chains surrounding collagen fibrils and result in marked skin hyperextensibility and fragility.

mcEDS- CHST14 was originally regarded as three independent conditions: a rare type of arthrogryposis syndrome (adducted thumb-clubfoot syndrome); a specific type of EDS (EDS, Kosho type)and a subset of kyphoscoliosis type without lysyl hydroxylase deficiency. These conditions were later recognised to represent a single clinical entity with highly characteristic features comprising multiple malformations (eg, craniofacial features, multiple congenital contractures, ocular and visceral malformations) and progressive fragility-related manifestations (eg, skin hyperextensibility and fragility, joint hypermobility with luxation, progressive spinal and foot deformities, large subcutaneous haematomas, visceral ruptures). Clinical features that correspond to the characteristics of EDS, along with the presence of altered collagen biosynthesis, justify its designation as a type of EDS.

Major diagnostic criteria for mcEDS- CHST14 are (1) multiple congenital contractures, characterised by adduction–flexion contractures and talipes equinovarus; (2) characteristic craniofacial features, evident at birth or in early infancy; and (3) characteristic cutaneous features including hyperextensibility, bruisability and fragility with atrophic scars and increased fine palmar creases. Thus far, 48 patients in 33 families have been reported, including six individuals from five families whose spinal manifestations were described. However, accurate prevalences of each feature/complication and detailed natural history data remain unknown.

We further delineated the spectrum of pathogenic variants, prevalences of various manifestation and natural history of mcEDS- CHST14, using detailed and systematically collected clinical and molecular findings of 48 reported and 18 newly identified patients with diverse demographic characteristics.

Comparison with mcEDS- DSE

Detailed clinical information of eight reported patients with mcEDS- DSE was combined in the integrated dataset along with patients with mcEDS- CHST14. Common clinical features and complications were added in table 1. Although clinical features were typically shared by both subtypes, statistical analyses showed that the frequencies of low-set ears, joint manifestations (hypermobility and recurrent joint dislocation), skin features (hyperextensibility, bruisability, fragility and atrophic scars), constipation and refractive errors were significantly higher (p < 0.01) in patients with mcEDS- CHST14 than in those with mcEDS- DSE (table 1).

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^1179n16G]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Skeletal survey — suspected intentional injury in children outlines age-specific imaging. Additionally perform a skeletal survey on siblings and household contacts of children with documented intentional injury who are 24-months-old and younger. Among children 2 years and older who are able to verbalize areas of injury and in whom a suspicion of intentional injury exists, focus initial imaging on the body regions of concern, and consider a skeletal survey in this older group to document the presence or absence of injuries, or when unexplained head injuries, abdominal injuries, or suspicious fractures are identified. Radiologic findings with greater specificity for intentional injury relate to the shaking mechanism of injury and include classic metaphyseal corner fractures and fractures of the ribs and spinous processes; other suspicious radiologic findings include epiphyseal separation injuries, sternal and scapular fractures, and multiple fractures of varying age.

### Acute rib fracture diagnosis in an infant by US: a matter of child protection [^115cu6mk]. Pediatric Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Rib fractures in infants and children are highly specific for inflicted injury in the absence of a major accidental injury or underlying bone disorder. We present a 9-week-old infant diagnosed with an acute rib fracture by US at the site where physicians palpated chest wall crepitus when no rib fractures had been visualized on the skeletal survey, including oblique views of the ribs. Based on the US diagnosis of the acute rib fracture the infant was taken into protective custody. Follow-up skeletal survey 2 weeks later revealed healing fractures of the left 6th and 7th posterolateral ribs and right 7th, 8th and 9th anterolateral ribs. We were unable to locate previous reports describing the diagnosis of rib fractures in infants by US.

Osteogenesis Imperfecta

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a rare disease writ large when the differential diagnosis of child abuse is considered. The cardinal feature of OI is increased bone fragility and, as such, must be considered when considering an infant with multiple fractures.

OI is classified according to the classification of Sillence et al. which for many years included only four types divided on both clinical and radiographic grounds. The Sillence classification describes a spectrum of disease rather than a strict system based on objective scientific identities. Type 1 is the most mild and patients have normal stature with little or no deformity. Type 2 is lethal in the perinatal period with beaded ribs, compressed deformed long bones, and minimal skull mineralization. Type 3 is of moderate severity with deformity generally present at birth. Type 4 is of mild to moderate severity with variable short stature and deformity. While with Types 2 and 3 the diagnosis is rarely in doubt, Types 1 and 4 engender considerable difficulties since both can be quite mild with little or no deformity present in infancy.

Types 1 to 4 are all caused by mutations in either the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene, which encode for formation of the procollagen alpha-1 or alpha-2 chain. Two alpha-1 and one alpha-2 chains form the triple helix of collagen 1, which is the major contributor to the normal collagen matrix in bone.

Biochemical or mutation analysis is capable of identifying approximately 90% to 95% of patients with Types 1 to 4. The number is steadily increasing. However, recent descriptions of several new types of OI have changed the landscape.

Type 5 is typified by grossly hypertrophic callus about fractures and curious ossification of the interosseous membrane in the forearm. It is usually moderate in severity, although some variability can be observed. It is not a mutation in collagen 1 and is not identifiable by either mutation or biochemical testing aimed at collagen 1.

Radiologic results

The result of head radiograph of the patient revealed an irregular skull shape, the closed cranial suture, and the skull bone dense sclerosis, all of which were characteristic patterns of IMO (Fig. 2 D). The result of his chest radiograph showed an increased lung texture on both sides of his lung due to the pneumonia, and a general increased density of rib bone (Fig. 2 E). Generally, the femur in a 4-month-old child was composed of 36% cortical and 64% trabecular bone, whereas the femur of this IMO patient contained at least 50% cortical bone. The radiograph of his left leg showed a complete fracture of femoral shaft (Fig. 2 F). Additionally, the bone marrow cavity was narrowed considerably. The result of his femoral radiograph also revealed an abnormal thickening of cortical bone and over mineralization of the trabecular bone, which was presented by a hyper bone density in bone marrow cavity and cortical bone (Fig. 2 F).

Physical examination

This child was 60 cm in height, and 4 kg in weight. His skull was abnormally enlarged. He was fully conscious and had a normal reaction to his surroundings, such as the stimulation of light and sound. His anterior and posterior fontanels were closed, yet the cranial nerve examination was normal.

Postoperative treatment

The cranioplasty on his left skull was performed smoothly at day 109. Three weeks later, he returned hospital for review and to perform the second cranioplasty on his right skull. However, we found a cerebrospinal fluid leakage in his brain. Therefore, we performed the ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery on the left side of his head to treat the leakage. Unfortunately, this child had developed a severe pneumonia during his recovery period. And a fracture of his left femoral shaft was happened at month 4. After the treatment of his fracture, the child was discharged.

Discussion

This study represents the first international and the largest cohort of patients with mcEDS- CHST14. It provides a detailed and comprehensive catalogue of clinical and molecular features associated with mcEDS- CHST14. A complete list of pathogenic variants in CHST14 from various ethnic backgrounds, accurate prevalence of multisystem manifestations and clinical courses of important complications are described.

Characteristic craniofacial, skeletal and cutaneous features were shared by all patients and could be recognisable during the neonatal period or infancy. Distinctive craniofacial and skeletal features evolved gradually from early childhood to adolescence or adulthood as mentioned in previous case series; and, regarding craniofacial features, we have created merged images of facial photographs in their childhood as well as in their adolescence−adulthood (figure 2A) and statistical significance was shown between the two periods (figure 2B). Talipes equinovarus, treated with braces or surgery, resulted in various types of progressive deformities. Congenital contractures of fingers tended to become milder and peripheral joint hypermobility tended to become prominent. Spinal deformities typically included mild scoliosis and occasionally progressive thoracolumbar kyphosis, accompanied by reduced physiological thoracic spine curvature, cervical kyphosis and vertebral malformations. Cutaneous features, as described previously and common in other types of EDS, included hyperextensibility, bruisability and fragility in all. Fine palmar creases without normal major palmar creases or flexion creases of fingers (figure 3) would suggest mcEDS- CHST14. All these major features in the disorder support the validity of minimal diagnostic criteria proposed in the 2017 International Classification: congenital multiple contractures and characteristic craniofacial features at birth or in early infancy; congenital multiple contractures and characteristic cutaneous features in adolescence and in adulthood.

The diagnosis of first rib fracture in an infant should prompt a thorough medical and social evaluation for child abuse.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^116uEGeF]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Child abuse — fracture recognition and evaluation emphasizes that children with acute fractures often present with irritability, pain, guarding, and limited use of the fractured extremity, and physical examination often demonstrates swelling with skin findings that may suggest mechanism; when presentation is delayed, overt signs can be absent, so image all suspected extremity fractures with dedicated biplanar (AP and lateral) radiographs. Some fracture patterns have higher specificity for abuse, including long bone classic metaphyseal lesions due to twisting or shearing with a bucket handle appearance on radiographs, rib fractures associated with the ribs held between the hands in a compressive shaking maneuver, and fractures in unusual locations (sternum, scapulae, vertebrae) associated with a holding and shaking mechanism, although these fractures are highly specific for PCA, recognize that any fracture can be caused by abuse. The most common fracture types in relation to abuse are rib, femur, tibia and humerus fractures, and rib fracture in any location or pattern in children under 3 years of age warrants a thorough evaluation of PCA; posterior, multiple or bilateral rib fractures, and multiple rib fractures in various stages of healing are highly associated with abuse. Femur and tibia fractures are not highly specific for abuse; location or fracture type is not pathognomonic for abuse, and the midshaft femur is the most common location in children with both PCA and unintentional injury. Up to 20% of fractures caused by physical abuse are initially attributed to unintentional injury.

In toddlers with severe forms of OI (mainly type III), the long bones may appear thick and broad, instead of thin and markedly shortened and bowed (Fig. 15). They exhibit a lack of bone modelling with a "bamboo cane appearance" linked to multiple healed fractures and severe bone deformities of the femur (anterolateral bowing or "shepherd's crook" deformity) (Fig. 15) and the tibia (anterior bowing or "saber shin" deformity) (Fig. 16).

Summary

Although nonoperative management is the mainstay for rib fracture treatment, surgical stabilization of rib fractures is becoming more common. Recently, the number of high-quality studies on management of rib fractures has also increased. The primary purpose of this review is to analyze the currently available prospective randomized studies on the management of rib fractures. In addition, we will summarize both short-term and long-term outcomes of patients with rib fractures.

Recommendation strength interpretation — language cues and definitions: Strong and moderate recommendations are associated with "should" and "should not" statements, whereas a weak recommendation may be recognized by "may" or "need not". A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, for a strong negative recommendation, the harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the supporting evidence quality is excellent; clinicians are advised to follow such guidance unless a clear and compelling rationale for acting in a contrary manner is present. A moderate recommendation means the committee believes benefits exceed harms (or harms exceed benefits for a negative recommendation) but the evidence on which the recommendation is based is not as strong, and clinicians are encouraged to follow such guidance while remaining alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. A weak recommendation means the existing evidence quality is suspect or well-designed, well-conducted studies have shown little clear advantage to one approach versus another, offering clinicians flexibility in decision-making, although boundaries on alternatives may be set.

### Craniosynostosis: neonatal perspectives [^117B9q2p]. NeoReviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of 1 or more sutures that normally separate the bony plates of an infant's skull and occurs in about 1 in 2,000 to 2,500 live births. Primary or congenital craniosynostoses represent the majority of cases and consist of single-suture and multisuture synostoses. Multisuture synostoses are typically associated with distinct craniofacial syndromes, including Muenke syndrome, Apert syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, and Pfeiffer syndrome, and are thus categorized under syndromic craniosynostoses. Secondary causes of craniosynostoses include metabolic or hematologic disorders that affect bone metabolism and typically present much later than primary synostoses. The severity of the deformity and the presence of increased intracranial pressure dictate the need for early surgical intervention, prompting the importance of early recognition and timely referral. Infants with craniosynostosis are also at increased risk for neurodevelopmental impairment and thus require close follow-up and monitoring. The early recognition and referral of craniosynostosis is imperative for the optimization of management and minimization of potential neurologic impairments that may develop.

Skeletal injuries — key points for child abuse emphasize that skeletal fractures are a sentinel injury and the second most common presenting sign of physical abuse. Fractures more specifically associated with abuse include rib fractures, classic metaphyseal lesions, or long bone fractures in the pre-ambulatory infant; however, any fracture location or pattern can be accompanied by physical abuse. High suspicion for physical abuse is warranted with a skeletal fracture in younger children, especially infants prior to walking.

### Update on the evaluation and treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta [^116i1fh8]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heritable bone fragility disorder that presents with a wide clinical phenotype spectrum: from perinatal lethality and severe deformities to very mild forms without fractures. Most cases of OI are due to autosomal dominant mutations of the type I collagen genes. A multidisciplinary approach with rehabilitation, orthopedic surgery, and consideration of medical therapy with bisphosphonates underpins current management. Greater understanding of the pathogenesis of OI may lead to novel, therapeutic approaches to help improve clinical symptoms of children with OI in the future.

This is a recommended management algorithm from the Western Trauma Association addressing the management of adult patients with rib fractures. Because there is a paucity of published prospective randomized clinical trials that have generated Class I data, these recommendations are based primarily on published observational studies and expert opinion of Western Trauma Association members. The algorithm and accompanying comments represent a safe and sensible approach that can be followed at most trauma centers. We recognize that there will be patient, personnel, institutional, and situational factors that may warrant or require deviation from the recommended algorithm. We encourage institutions to use this as a guideline to develop their own local protocols.

### Genetic evaluation of suspected osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) [^116u5HLg]. Genetics in Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is probably the most common genetic form of fracture predisposition. The term OI encompasses a broad range of clinical presentations that may be first apparent from early in pregnancies to late in life, reflecting the extent of bone deformity and fracture predisposition at different stages of development or postnatal ages. Depending on the age of presentation, OI can be difficult to distinguish from some other genetic and nongenetic causes of fractures, including nonaccidental injury (abuse). The strategies for evaluation and the testing discussed here provide guidelines for evaluation that should help to distinguish among causes for fracture and bone deformity.

### New perspectives on the treatment of skeletal dysplasia [^114pDPMf]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Osteogenesis imperfecta: not a unique strategy

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is the most common bone fragility disorder, affecting 1 in 10,000–20,000 birthswith a broad spectrum of clinical severity from antenatal lethal form to moderate adult disorder. Clinical and radiological features are low-impact bone fractures, osteopenia, bowing long bones, vertebral compressions, or growth deficiency. Individuals with OI also commonly exhibit dentinogenesis imperfecta. This generalized connective-tissue disorder can also include joint laxity, muscle weakness, fatigue, blue sclerae, hearing loss, decreased pulmonary function, and cardiac valvular regurgitation. The original classification by Sillence described four subtypes: (I) typically mild nondeforming OI with blue sclerae; (II) perinatally lethal OI; (III) progressively deforming disease; (IV) common variable disease with normal sclera.

About 85–90% of cases are related to dominant mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genescoding for the α1(I) and α2(I) chains of type I collagen, the most abundant protein of bone mineralized ECM, also present in ligaments, tendons, dentin, sclera, and skin. Since 2006, advances in genetic analysis allowed the identification of new genes related to OI. These genes, mainly recessive, are implicated in collagen folding or post-translational modifications or in osteoblast differentiation and function.

Patients with OI are managed by calcium and vitamin D supplements, physiotherapy and surgery. Oral and venous bisphosphonates, with their antiresorptive properties, are the main pharmacological interventions in OI. New therapeutic strategies are currently being investigated, such as pharmacological strategies with further antiresorptive drugs or stimulating ossification agents and mesenchymal cell transplantation (Figure 1).

### Bone density, fractures and the associated factors in Iranian children and adolescent with osteogenesis imperfecta [^11657Fc2]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteogenesis imperfecta(OI), or brittle bone disease, is one of the most common primary bone fragility disorder in children and adolescents. It is due to a mutation in one of the two genes coding for collagen type I, the genes associated with the modification of collagen type 1 and some transcription factors are related with osteoblast differentiation. Its prevalence was reported as 1 in 15–20,000 births. Diagnosis is based on history, clinical findings and radiographic findings of repeated old and new fractures which showed no criteria of other metabolic bone disease. Radiographs was used to ruled out other metabolic bone disease such as rickets. Its clinical manifestations are classified as skeletal and extra-skeletal. Skeletal features include bowing deformities of long bones, macrocephaly, fracture due to mild trauma, face malformation, chest wall deformities and short stature. Extra-skeletal manifestations consist in blue sclera, dentinogenesis imperfecta, and hearing impairment. OI has been categorized, according to clinical presentation into four types(types I– IV), based on Sillence criteria. This criteria was introduced in 1979 according to clinical and radiological findings and mode of inheritance, prior to the availability of molecular genetic analyses. Type I is mild and the most frequent type without bone deformity and short stature. it's inheritance is autosomal-dominant and these patients may have blue sclera. OI type II is the pre- or perinatal lethal form because of multiple fractures, osteopenia and pulmonary hypoplasia. OI type III is the most severe type in children surviving the neonatal period, suffer several peripheral and vertebral fractures. At last, OI type IV is an overlapping phenotype of OI types I and III with variable clinical presentation. Clinical OI types II, III, and IV have either autosomal or recessive inheritance.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^114VBGBT]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

BRUE risk assessment — Patients who have experienced a BRUE may have a recurrent event or an undiagnosed serious condition that confers risk, and by consensus the subcommittee established < 1 minute as the upper limit of a "brief event"; the committee also agreed by consensus that the need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be determined by trained medical providers. Infants who do not qualify as lower-risk are, by definition, at higher risk, and thus, pending further research, this guideline does not provide recommendations for the management of the higher-risk infant. The key action statements in this guideline do not apply to higher-risk patients but apply only to infants who meet the lower-risk criteria. Some studies suggest examples of higher risk, including that infants younger than 2 months who experience a BRUE may be more likely to have a congenital or infectious cause and be at higher risk of an adverse outcome, and that infants with multiple events or a concerning social assessment for child abuse may warrant increased observation.

### Syndromes with congenital brittle bones [^111TYFZp]. BMC Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Osteogenesis imperfecta (types are ordered based on severity from mild to severe)

Type I OI

The most common mutation causing OI type I causes a reduction in the production of otherwise normal type I collagen secondary to the effect of a null allele mutation. Patients often have normal stature, and a slightly low stature does not preclude the diagnosis of type I OI. "Type I OI" is not a synonymous of "mild OI". Individuals may have few or no fractures, mostly during the first years of life or even at birth, or numerous fractures throughout their lives. They may have triangular face. They are fully ambulatory, and do not have bowing of the long bones, although vertebral fractures may be present. Most have blue sclera, but it can be white, or blue color may fade as the individual grows older. This condition is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. Despite the absence of fractures, bone density can be very low, with no relation with clinical severity, underscoring the relative lack of significance of bone density measurements assessing severity in patients with OI. In many instances bone density is normal during the first months of life, and individuals progressively fail to increase bone mineral density with age. In some cases the diagnosis is an incidental finding after a fracture. Dentinogenesis imperfecta can be present even in very mild cases. Early hypoacusia and cardio-vascular problems, particularly aortic valvular disease can be present in these subjects.

Type IV OI (Moderate OI with short stature)

These individuals typically have short stature, bowing of long bones, and vertebral fractures. Scoliosis and joint laxity may be present. Patients with this form of OI are generally able to ambulate, but they may require aids for walking. Based in the presence of DI, moderate OI has been sub-divided in two forms, "a" and "b". These patients have white sclera. Precise diagnosis of this type of OI is often difficult, as the clinical characteristics are not clear in the literature, and different centers base the diagnosis on different criteria.

### Osteogenesis imperfecta type VIII: highlighting the need for genetic testing [^114N7zm3]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

We report a severe form of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type VIII from a lower-middle income country. This is the first case report of this type in Tanzania. The term neonate was delivered normally via spontaneous vaginal delivery and presented at the neonatal unit with features of shortened limb girdles and macrocephaly. The long bones had multiple fractures. He was diagnosed clinically to have OI or a type of metaphysial dysplasia. A plain X-ray showed multiple fractures of the long bones. The eyes did not have blue sclerae. Clinically, the generic diagnosis of OI was made. Genetic testing revealed typical prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3HI) gene mutations and a variant coordinate NM_001243246.1:c.1095C > Gp, indicating a severe, fatal form of autosomal-recessive OI type VIII which presents with white sclerae. This rare variant is described here for the first time in our setting. This case highlights the need for genetic testing.

### Unexplained fractures: child abuse or bone disease? A systematic review [^1147kvp6]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Child abuse and neglect (CAN) is a serious problem, and an improper diagnosis carries tremendous consequences for the patient, his or her family, and the doctor. A substantial degree of morbidity and mortality is associated with a missed diagnosis, with a reinjury rate of 50% and a mortality rate of 10% for unprotected children. In addition, the emotional trauma for the patient and family undergoing a prolonged investigation by Child Protective Services (and perhaps even the wrongful removal of custody) demonstrates the power of a misguided diagnosis of abuse. With fractures representing the second most common manifestation of child abuse after soft tissue trauma, orthopaedic surgeons are at the forefront of evaluating patients with potential CAN.

Many studies have described the musculoskeletal manifestations of child abuse: rib fractures, skull fractures, humeral and femur fractures are among the most common. Recent studies demonstrated that the combination of patient age and fracture location can reproducibly differentiate abuse from accidental trauma. Among these factors, a suspicious history, physical or radiographic evidence of prior injury, and age younger than 18 months are associated with CAN.

In 1962, Kempe et al. introduced the concept of "battered child syndrome". The authors included osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) as part of the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with potential abuse. The authors noted that OI should be easily distinguishable from abuse based on history and physical examination. Despite their assertions, there is little evidence to suggest clinicians can readily differentiate patients with OI (and other metabolic bone disorders with a propensity for fracture) from those who have sustained their fractures as a result of CAN. Although patients with OI/metabolic bone disease can present with the "classic" features of OI (multiple fractures after minor trauma at an early age, blue sclera, osteopenia, wormian bones, dentinogenesis imperfecta, and a family history of "easy" fractures and/or bone disease), many times these features are not present. In these cases, it is not clear how to further investigate the presence of these rare conditions in a cost-effective and directed manner for patients presenting with potential abuse. Unfortunately, the burden falls on the clinician to distinguish between these conditions with limited data to guide the decision-making process. Although there is an abundance of literature differentiating abuse from accidental trauma, there exists relatively little work on the role that bone diseases such as OI play in the evaluation of a patient with suspected abuse.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for rib fracture, more specifically with respect to chest imaging, ACR 2019 guidelines recommend to obtain a CXR as the initial imaging in patients with suspected rib fractures in the following situations:

- minor blunt trauma (injury confined to ribs)

- after CPR

- pathologic fracture.

### The radiographic approach to child abuse [^113FVaFz]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Fig. 2A–B
(A) An AP chest radiograph of a 3-month-old infant shows a classic posteromedial rib fracture near the midline (arrow), with other healing rib fractures seen elsewhere (arrowheads). (B) An axial CT image of the same patient shows the same posteromedial fracture with irregular linear lucency (arrow). It is more clearly evident on the CT image than on the radiograph shown in (A). Other rib fractures with periosteal reaction indicating healing are also present (arrowheads and curved arrow).

By conventional radiography, an acute rib fracture can be identified by a linear lucency in the bone. The lucency varies in conspicuity depending on the angle of the fracture with respect to the beam, age of the fracture, and amount of displacement. Rib fractures are usually either nondisplaced or only minimally displaced and can be very difficult to diagnose acutely. With healing, callus develops and identifies the fracture as a small segment of fusiform widening and then tapering in the contour of the rib. Initially, the linear lucency of the fracture becomes more apparent and then fades as the fracture heals. Occasionally, only subtle linear sclerosis may be present. By CT scanning, all these phases are more easily evident, as well as the important confirmatory soft tissue changes, including pulmonary contusions, pleural effusions, and extrapleural soft tissue swelling and hemorrhage. The "hole in the rib" pattern can be explained by medullary trabecular resorption about the fracture resulting in radiographically evident radiolucency surrounding a healing fracture (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
An AP chest radiograph of a 1-month-old infant shows multiple right lateral rib fractures. Focal expansion and medullary lucency are present at the eighth rib fracture (arrow) typical of the "hole in the rib" appearance.

The ribs are curved structures and the rib necks posteromedially hide behind and next to the denser mediastinum. For these reasons, oblique views of the chest are very helpful in diagnosis of rib fractures. Multidetector-row CT is also a valuable adjunct, and while it is not usually performed as a part of the ordinary skeletal survey, it is frequently obtained as a part of the larger assessment of soft tissue injuries in the thorax and abdomen of abused infants. Postmortem high-detail radiographs are effective as well (Fig. 4).

### Comparison of prevalence and characteristics of fractures in term and preterm infants in the first 3 years of life [^116C2Dxb]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study did not demonstrate a statistically significant increased risk of childhood fractures for boys. This is different from Wagner et al. who found in their adjusted analysis that independent associations of increased rate of fracture in the first 5 years of life include being male. The male gender was associated with a 9% increase in the rate of fracture within the age group of 2–5 years, independent of prematurity status. In contrast, Holloway et al. found that the proportion of all prevalent fractures in the 0- to 10-year age group (not adjusted for comorbidities or medications) was similar for both genders at about 10%, with males having a slightly higher prevalence. However, they did not quantify if this difference was statistically significant.

The current study is limited by the small sample size of fracture-positive patients. Based on the findings of this study, 9,537 fracture-positive patients would have been needed to exclude our null hypothesis, requiring a multicentre study or meta-analysis of smaller studies. Our goal was to compare fracture patterns and sites in preterm and term infants in the first 3 years of life, with particular emphasis on the fracture types typically associated with inflicted injury, after excluding any preexisting conditions or medications affecting bone metabolism. There were no rib or metaphyseal fractures. There were no very low birth weight or extremely low birth weight children, and no infants were born extremely premature. The average gestational ages were approximately 32 + 3/7 weeks and 39 + 6/7 weeks in our preterm and term populations, respectively. Evidence from other studies suggests that extremes of birth weights and prematurity are those with an increased risk of fractures and only in early infancy. Our population did not capture all categories of prematurity and birth weights and will be less likely to pick up increased risks, if any. However, our study, even after excluding confounding factors, corroborates other studies that have shown no increased risk of early childhood fractures in premature infants. Evidence suggests that any risk of increased fractures in the preterm population is limited to the first year of life, due to catch-up mineralisation postnatally. For pragmatic reasons, we could only identify children presenting to the local Emergency Department and therefore our results do not include any child born within the study period who had moved away or had private care. We did not identify any cases of inflicted injury and are therefore unable to comment on any differences in clinical presentation of fractures between inflicted and accidental trauma in preterm infants.

### Timing of birth for women with a twin pregnancy at term: a randomised controlled trial [^116oCsZw]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2010). Low credibility.

Primary Study Endpoint

A composite mortality and morbidity index has been chosen as the primary outcome for the trial. For a policy of elective birth at 37 weeks gestation to be justified in clinical practice, there must be an important benefit of reduced perinatal mortality or serious adverse outcome for the infants defined as one or more of the following:

- Perinatal mortality defined as any fetal death after trial entry, or death of a liveborn infant within 28 days of age (excluding lethal congenital anomalies); or

- Serious neonatal morbidity defined as one or more of the following, excluding lethal congenital anomalies, and reflecting either asphyxia (birth trauma (subdural or intracerebral haemorrhage, spinal cord injury, basal skull fracture, other fracture, peripheral nerve injury present at discharge from hospital); birth weight ≤ 3 rd centile for gestational age at birth and infant sex; Apgar score ≤ 4 at 5 minutes of age; cord pH ≤ 7.00; seizures at ≤ 24 hours age or requiring two or more drugs to control; neonatal encephalopathy grade 3 or 4) or immaturity (use of ventilation ≥ 24 hours; admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) ≥ 4 days; severe respiratory distress syndrome (MAP ≥ 10 and or FiO 2 ≥ 0.8 with need for ventilation); neonatal encephalopathy grade 3 or 4 chronic lung disease defined as continued oxygen requirement at 28 days of life; proven necrotising enterocolitis; proven systemic infection within 48 hours of birth treated with antibiotics).

These definitions of adverse outcome are those used by the Australian and New Zealand Neonatal Network, and those considered by experts as important measures of term and post-term neonatal morbidity.

Secondary Study Endpoints

1.000000000000000e+00 Antenatal medical and obstetric complications including: pre-eclampsia or eclampsia (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and diastolic ≥ 90 mmHg on two occasions four hours apart or more, and one of proteinuria (≥ 300 mg/24 hours or spot urine creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/mmol), renal insufficiency (serum plasma creatinine ≥ 0.09 mmol/L or oliguria), liver disease (elevated serum transaminases &/or right upper quadrant pain), neurological disturbances (convulsions, hyperreflexia with clonus, severe headache with hyperreflexia, persistent visual disturbances), or haematological disturbances (thrombocytopaenia, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, haemolysis),) antepartum haemorrhage requiring hospitalisation; and abnormal umbilical artery Doppler study (absent or reversed end diastolic flow as detected by ultrasound examination).

### Complications and outcome after rib fracture fixation: a systematic review [^112BdDsj]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in operative treatment for multiple rib fractures and flail chest. However, to date, there is no comprehensive study that extensively focused on the incidence of complications associated with rib fracture fixation. Furthermore, there is insufficient knowledge about the short- and long-term outcomes after rib fracture fixation.

Methods

This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched to identify studies reporting on complications and/or outcome of surgical treatment after rib fractures. Complications were subdivided into (1) surgery- and implant-related complications, (2) bone-healing complications, (3) pulmonary complications, and (4) mortality.

Results

Forty-eight studies were included, with information about 1,952 patients who received rib fracture fixation because of flail chest or multiple rib fractures. The overall risk of surgery- and implant-related complications was 10.3%, with wound infection in 2.2% and fracture-related infection in 1.3% of patients. Symptomatic nonunion was a relatively uncommon complication after rib fixation (1.3%). Pulmonary complications were found in 30.9% of patients, and the overall mortality was 2.9%, of which one third appeared to be the result of the thoracic injuries and none directly related to the surgical procedure. The most frequently used questionnaire to assess patient quality of life was the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) (n = 4). Four studies reporting on the EQ-5D had a weighted mean EQ-5D index of 0.80 indicating good quality of life after rib fracture fixation.

Conclusion

Surgical fixation can be considered as a safe procedure with a considerably low complication risk and satisfactory long-term outcomes, with surgery- and implant-related complications in approximately 10% of the patients. However, the clinically most relevant complications such as infections occur infrequently, and the number of complications requiring immediate (surgical) treatment is low.

### ESR essentials: imaging of suspected child abuse-practice recommendations by the European society of paediatric radiology [^111dVox5]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Skeletal injuries

Fractures in otherwise healthy children under the age of 24 months are rare, with an annual incidence of 0.07% in infants and 0.7% in children aged 12–24 months. In infants, fractures to the femur and tibia predominate as opposed to the tibia and forearm in children aged 12–24 months. Fractures as a result of physical child abuse are significantly more common in children under 18 months of age compared to older children. Up to a third of physically abused children are diagnosed with fractures, many of which are multiple and occult. Any bone may be involved, but some locations have a higher specificity for physical child abuse, such as rib and metaphyseal fractures, whereas long bone and skull fractures are the most frequent.

Rib fractures

In children under the age of 3 years, rib fractures are estimated to have a positive predictive value for physical abuse of 95%, with reported prevalence of rib fractures in cases of suspected child abuse at 14%. Abusive rib fractures can occur at any point along the rib, from the costovertebral articulations to the costochondral junctions (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5
Skull fractures on 3-D reconstructed CT images. A, B Complex fractures (arrows) of the right parietal bone (A) with a displaced quadrangular-shaped fragment (asterisk in A) and linear fracture (arrows) of the left parietal bone (B) in a 6-week-old boy. C, D Complex fractures of the left (C) and right (D) parietal bones (arrows) in a 5-month-old boy

Abusive rib fractures are typically multiple, located in posterior and lateral locations from ribs 5 through 8, and more commonly on the left. In up to 29% of cases, one or more rib fractures are the only skeletal finding in an abused child, underscoring the importance of high-quality radiographs and an eye for detail. Chest CT might be considered in children with indeterminate chest findings on skeletal survey.

### The role of prenatal ultrasound and added value of post-mortem radiographic imaging with X-ray and CT in suspected fetal skeletal dysplasia [^113kH6Aq]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

4.1 Post‐Mortem Radiographic Imaging

In this Finnish cohort of 36 cases of prenatally suspected fetal skeletal dysplasia, post‐mortem radiographic imaging with X‐ray and CT significantly improved diagnostic yield. The imaging was useful after both the first and second trimester terminations. These methods were superior to ultrasound especially in detecting spinal and thoracic abnormalities. X‐ray and CT also performed better in discovering fractures and deformities of long bones, thus increasing diagnostic accuracy. When imaging is performed after termination, there is no concern about radiation exposure and no need to minimize radiation dose.

Post‐mortem CT can help in evaluation of fetal skeleton especially with 3D reformats. Small targets and overlapping bones can be challenging for X‐ray only, especially after fetal demise or termination if fetus is macerated. With X‐ray, the findings can be observed only from one direction, whereas CT enables inspection from multiple directions, which can help in characterization of skeletal abnormalities. X‐ray can raise a suspicion of abnormality, but CT can confirm the finding and give more detailed information of the abnormality e.g. bowed bone might turn out as a fracture in CT. In our study, X‐ray and CT were performed parallel to enhance diagnostic quality. In line with our results, Calder and Nishimura have also shown the benefits of post‐mortem fetal radiographs although in their studies CT was only used occasionally.

Osteogenesis imperfecta can be challenging to diagnose with US if the fractures and deformities are not clearly visible. In our cohort, there was one case where post‐mortem X‐ray/CT revealed multiple fractures in the ribs and femora that had been missed with US. The typical findings of most severe and lethal forms of OI are usually detectable by US, but that is not the case with all prenatal‐onset types of the disease. X‐ray/CT can therefore improve the prenatal diagnostics of Osteogenesis imperfecta.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^112hTrTb]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Skeletal radiologic survey — indications, technique, and limitations: imaging plays an important role in identifying intentional physical injury, and the ACR and Society for Pediatric Radiology (SPR) published practice parameters for skeletal surveys in children in 2016. The skeletal survey is the primary imaging examination for detecting fractures, and a complete survey includes frontal and lateral views of the skull and thorax (including the ribs and thoracic spine), lateral views of the C-spine and lumbosacral spine, oblique views of the ribs, single frontal views of the long bones, hands, feet, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, plus separate views of each arm, forearm, thigh, leg, hand and foot; a single "babygram" radiograph of the entire infant provides insufficient anatomic detail and has no role in the evaluation for suspected physical abuse. Recommended technical equipment and parameters are outlined in the ACR Practice Parameter, with high-resolution mode on digital systems optimizing visualization of osseous structures. A skeletal survey is recommended in all children 24-months-old and younger when intentional injury is suspected, and when high suspicion exists, a follow up skeletal survey after two weeks can identify previously occult fractures and clarify equivocal findings.

Reasons for referral

Prenatal

Prenatal ultrasounds showing abnormalities suggestive of OI (diminished mineralization of skull, platyspondyly or bowing, shortening and/or fractures of long bones) are an important reason for referral for molecular diagnostics of OI.

Postnatal

Radiographs at birth suggestive of OI, recurrent and/or unexplained fractures with or without suspicion of non-accidental injury (NAI), primary (idiopathic) low bone mass, preferably with exclusion of secondary causes, a family history of OI and request for confirmation of the clinical diagnosis are all reasons for referral for molecular diagnostics of OI. However, in some cases dentinogenesis imperfecta or even blue sclerae might be the only reason for referral. As such, physicians from many specialties (gynaecologist, paediatrician, orthopaedic surgeon, clinical geneticist, general practitioner, dentist, ear nose throat specialist, endocrinologist, internist and ophthalmologist) might refer a patient for molecular analysis. Depending on the age of presentation, OI can be difficult to distinguish from some other genetic conditions, for example, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome arthrochalasis type (former EDS VIIA and B), isolated dentinogenesis imperfecta, blue sclerae and corneal fragility, hypophosphatasia, and non-genetic causes of fractures including NAI and idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis.,

Non-accidental injury

Many referrals for OI diagnostics occur in the context of suspected NAI in an attempt to exclude a genetic cause of fractures. Fractures resulting from NAI occur in 24 per 10 000 children under 3 years of age whereas the OI prevalence is 1 per 10 000–20 000. The incidence of OI among children evaluated for NAI is 2–5%. Differentiation is aided by an experienced clinician and radiologist familiar with OIas the nature and localization of fractures in OI and NAI can often be distinguished. However, because injuries may involve infants before many of the clinical features of OI are apparent, laboratory diagnostics for OI can certainly be helpful in this differentiation.

### Does surgery reduce the risk of complications among patients with multiple rib fractures? A meta-analysis [^114d9rPU]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Multiple rib fractures are common in trauma patients, who are prone to trauma-associated complications. Surgical or nonsurgical interventions for the aforementioned conditions remain controversial.

Questions/Purposes

The purpose of our study was to perform a meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical prognosis of surgical fixation of multiple rib fractures in terms of (1) hospital-related endpoints (including duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay [LOS] and hospital LOS), (2) complications, (3) pulmonary function, and (4) pain scores.

Methods

We screened PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases for randomized and prospective studies published before January 2018. Individual effect sizes were standardized; the pooled effect size was calculated using a random-effects model. Primary outcomes were duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit length of stay (ICU LOS), and hospital LOS. Moreover, complications, pulmonary function, and pain were assessed.

Results

The surgical group had a reduced duration of mechanical ventilation (weighted mean difference [WMD], -4.95 days; 95% confidence interval [CI] -7.97 to -1.94; p = 0.001), ICU LOS (WMD, -4.81 days; 95% CI, -6.22 to -3.39; p < 0.001), and hospital LOS (WMD, -8.26 days; 95% CI, -11.73 to -4.79; p < 0.001) compared with the nonsurgical group. Complications likewise were less common in the surgical group, including pneumonia (odds ratio [OR], 0.41; 95% CI, 0.27–0.64; p < 0.001), mortality (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.07–0.87; p = 0.030), chest wall deformity (OR, 0.02; 95% CI. 0.00–0.12; p < 0.001), dyspnea (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.09–0.54; p < 0.001), chest wall tightness (OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.05–0.22; p < 0.001) and incidence of tracheostomy (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.20–0.57; p < 0.001). There were no differences between the surgical and nonsurgical groups in terms of pulmonary function, such as forced vital capacity (WMD, 6.81%; 95% CI: -8.86 to 22.48; p = 0.390) and pain scores (WMD, -11.41; 95% CI: -42.09 to 19.26; p = 0.470).

Conclusions

This meta-analysis lends stronger support to surgical fixation, rather than conservative treatment, for multiple rib fractures. Nevertheless, additional trials should be conducted to investigate surgical indications, timing, and followup for quality of life.

Antenatal diagnosis of OI

Severe forms of OI (mainly type II) can be diagnosed by ultrasound during the second trimester of pregnancy. Nonspecific signs such as intra-uterine growth retardation or hydramnios may be seen. Otherwise, examination may show abnormalities of the skull, the rib cage, the spine or the limbs, such as decreased echogenicity due to insufficient mineralisation, deformities related to fractures, callus formation and increased bone plasticity, and micromelia, especially of the femur (Fig. 1). In case of doubt and when a termination of pregnancy is being considered, low-dose computed tomography (CT) with three-dimensional reconstructions of the whole foetal skeleton can be performed, after 26 weeks of gestation, to yield a correct diagnosis. The role of MRI is limited, except when visualisation of the foetal brain or visceral organs is required to look for associated abnormalities or to assess foetal lung volume. When termination of pregnancy is performed based on the discovery of ultrasound and CT abnormalities, postmortem radiographs are a very useful adjunct to diagnosis, in confirming and specifying foetal bone abnormalities (Fig. 2).

### Unexplained fractures: child abuse or bone disease? A systematic review [^115NAUFx]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Therefore, we addressed the following questions: (1) What diseases and conditions that cause easy fracture can be confused with CAN? (2) What types of OI are most commonly confused with CAN and why? (3) What specific findings in OI and bone disease render a mistaken diagnosis of CAN more likely?

### The radiographic approach to child abuse [^113Pe7aJ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Type 6 is moderate in severity and indistinguishable from Type 4 clinically. It is not identifiable by mutation or collagen biochemical analysis. On microscopy of biopsied bone, it is indicated by a characteristic mineralization defect in bone.

Two new types classified as Types 7 and 8 are caused by abnormal posttranslational modification of the collagen molecule and are not identifiable by the traditional OI mutation or biochemical analysis. Both of these types manifest severe phenotypes with severe bone fragility. Metaphyseal changes and bulbous "popcorn" epiphyses, in which irregular dense calcifications are present, have been described. Given the severity of these types, they should not cause confusion when considered with respect of child abuse.

The complexity and variability present in OI make differentiation from abuse very challenging and both mutation and biochemical collagen analysis are frequently performed. Since the tests are only about 90% to 95% sensitive, the results can be unsatisfying and lead to confusion when trying to differentiate abuse from OI. However, several important points may be made.

While rib fractures can occur, it is generally in the more severe types. Fractures are usually lateral and are uncommon posteromedially. Posteromedial rib fractures even in a child with OI should be taken very seriously and, except in moderate to severe cases of OI, or in the face of severe osteopenia are highly suspicious for abuse because of the typical mechanism needed to produce those fractures. In severe OI, no mechanism is needed to explain a fracture, but in mild cases the mechanism of injury reigns supreme and must be considered.

CMLs are also highly suspicious. In epiphyseal cartilage, collagen 2 predominates. At the physeal level, collagen 1 is not present and is produced in the metaphyses. As such, the most fragile portion of the bones of a patient afflicted with OI is not the physes but the midshaft, where fractures are more frequent. CML-type injuries are extraordinarily rare in OI and are even more rare, if they occur at all, in children younger than 1 year. For a CML to occur, in the face of trauma, the physis and zone of provisional calcification need to have greater weakness when compared to the diaphyses and this is not usually the case in OI. There have been no reports in the literature describing an infant with OI sustaining a true CML.

An unusual opportunity permitted us to follow the course of pregnancy in the first child of a 35-year-old man with OI type V. The ultrasound scans at 22 weeks of gestation permitted the detection of skeletal abnormalities (bowing of the femur illustrated in Fig. 2), and at 33 weeks a thin calvarium and angulated ribs suggesting intrauterine fracture. At birth, the infant had two healing rib fractures, bowing of the femurs, and a thin calvarium but no other abnormalities.

Figure 2
Prenatal ultrasound at 22 weeks showing bowing of the femur (the crosshairs show the extremities of the femur).

Extraskeletal findings of note include 2 patients with mitral valve prolapse (patients 8 and 10), 2 patients (patients 7 and 8) with histories of symptomatic nephrolithiasis, and 1 patient with hypertension and depression (patient 15). Orthopedic surgical histories include 7 patients who had undergone at least one long-bone intramedullary rodding (typically tibias and femurs). Additionally, 3 patients underwent posterior spinal fusion for scoliosis. Surgical resection of dislocated radial heads were performed in 2 patients from the same family (patients 2 and 3) with only marginal improvements noted in elbow range of motion and no increase in range of motion at the wrist. There was no HPC formation following rodding or other orthopedic surgeries in our cohort.

Of the 17 patients with OI reported here, 10 received treatment with bisphosphonates: 5 received only pamidronate intravenously (patients 1, 2, 9, 12, and 16), 1 adult (patient 3) and 1 pediatric patient (patient 14) received only oral alendronate, and another 2 adults (patients 8 and 15) received both oral and intravenous treatments in succession (alendronate and pamidronate or zoledronic acid).

The results of clinical laboratory studies of serum calcium, phosphorus, 25(OH) vitamin D, and insulin-like growth factor were within normal limits for all patients. Alkaline phosphatase activity, although elevated during fracture or HPC formation, was typically within normal limits with one notable exception: serum total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase activities were persistently elevated in 3 patients.

Demographic data and treatment modalities are summarized in Table 1. Four families with multiple individuals with OI type V are grouped in Table 1; the remaining 8 nonfamilial cases were the result of spontaneous mutations. The average age at diagnosis in our cohort of 8 males and 9 females was 1 year of age. Z -scores for height averaged −2.9 ± 3.4 for males and −4.5 ± 3.6 for females (mean values are presented with standard deviations throughout this work). Z -scores for weight averaged −1.5 ± 1.4 for males and −1.3 ± 1.0 for females. Body mass index (BMI) values averaged 29 ± 8 kg/m² for men and 29 ± 2 kg/m² for women over the age of 18 years.

Demographic Overview of Cohort

Clinical features are summarized in Table 2. Two patients exhibited blue sclerae. Three patients had pes planus. Eleven patients were described as having bilateral hyperextensible joints in at least one extremity, typically in digits and elbows. Fifteen patients exhibited limited/absent ability to supinate and pronate the forearm due to dislocation of the radial head. With regard to other common OI findings, triangular facies were observed in 10 patients. DI was not observed in any patient. Hearing loss, either conductive or mixed, was generally absent from the cohort; only 1 patient (patient 2) was noted to have mild (8 kHz) unilateral mixed hearing loss.

Radiographic findings characteristic of OI Type V patients are summarized in Table 3. Thirteen patients exhibited interosseous membrane calcification (Fig. 1). One patient (patient 5) was incidentally noted to have calcification of her left lower extremity interosseous membrane. Also, 14 patients were observed to have dislocated radial heads bilaterally. Thirteen patients had scoliosis; all patients over the age of 5 years exhibited mild to severe scoliosis. Additionally, 9 patients exhibited bowing of long bones: 6 had anterior bowing of the tibias and/or fibulas, 3 had bowing of the femurs, and 6 had bowing of the forearms. Ten patients experienced one or more episodes of HPC formation (Fig. 1) after trauma-related fractures.

### Genotype-phenotype correlation study in 364 osteogenesis imperfecta Italian patients [^113AbA6T]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI; MIM#166200, MIM#166210, MIM#259420, and MIM#166220) is a rare hereditary connective tissue disorder, with an incidence of ~1:15,000 to 1:20,000 in newborns. The clinical spectrum, characterized by a wide intra- and interfamilial variability, is a continuum ranging from nearly asymptomatic individuals with occasional fractures, regular stature, and normal lifespan to phenotypes characterized by severe skeletal fragility, bone deformities, and significant growth deficiency up to neonatal lethality. Affected patients may also show a number of non-skeletal features such as blue sclera, hearing deficit, dentinogenesis imperfecta (DGI), cardiac defects, and joint hyperlaxity. The disease is also characterized by a huge genetic heterogeneity, including autosomal-dominant, autosomal-recessive, and X-linked forms. About 90% of cases are caused by dominant mutations in COL1A1 (MIM#120150) or COL1A2 (MIM#120160) genes, encoding for α1(I) and α2(I) chains of type I collagen. OI patients were distinguished in four clinical types according to clinical signs and radiographic features, then updated with more recent revisions. Type I is the most common and includes patients with blue sclera and a range of fractures in the absence of bone deformities. OI type II results in prenatal or perinatal lethal outcome with severe deformities, congenital fractures, and marked deficiency of ossification. Type III is the most severe OI in non-lethal cases, characterized by a very short stature, long bone deformities, and multiple spinal problems. Lastly, type IV is a moderately deforming form with a variable phenotypic expression, with the presence of multiple fractures and white/gray sclera. From a structural point of view, type I collagen is the major extracellular matrix protein of the bone, skin, tendon, and ligament. It is a heterotrimer constituted of two α1 chains and one α2-chain. Each chain has an amino- and a carboxyl-terminal propeptide at the ends and a central triple helical domain composed of 338 uninterrupted Gly-X-Y triplets. Glycine has a key role in collagen organization, as it is the only amino acid small enough to guarantee the proper folding of the polypeptide chains. The assembly of pro-α1 and pro-α2-chains into a triple helix begins at the carboxyl-terminal toward the amino-terminal end. OI type I is usually caused by nonsense, frameshift, splice site mutations, and by a small number of big rearrangements that result in a reduced synthesis of structurally normal type I collagen, referred as a quantitative defect. On the other hand, OI types II–IV are mostly caused by substitutions of glycine in the triple helical domain, leading to abnormal type I collagen molecules that alter the triple helix folding and the fibrils formation, resulting in a qualitative defect. So far, more than 1500 COL1A1-A2 distinct variants have been described in the OI Variant Database. Despite this, some general rules about the genotype–phenotype relationship have been recognized, but all clinical manifestations have not been investigated yet and no directions about the wide clinical variability have been defined, including the different clinical outcome observed in patients who carry the same DNA change. In the present study, correlation between the occurrence of clinical manifestations and the type/location of genetic variants in COL1A1-A2 genes was investigated to describe OI clinical spectrum in the Italian population and to obtain useful indications to better predict the evolution of the disease and the follow-up management.

### Severe osteogenesis imperfecta type-III and its challenging treatment in newborn and preschool children. A systematic review [^114aU5JZ]. Injury (2015). Low credibility.

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of genetic disorders, of which Type III is the most severe among survivors. The disease is characterised in particular by bone fragility, decreased bone mass and increased incidence of fractures. Other usual findings are muscle hypotonia, joint hypermobility and short stature. Fractures and weak bones may consequently cause limb and spinal deformity and chronic physical disability. Bisphosphonates have revolutionised the treatment of newborn children with severe OI type III. Surgery is still needed in most patients due to high frequency of the fractures. In this systematic review we describe the present state-of-art in treating the most severe type of OI in newborn and preschool children with their bone fractures.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^113mZs5R]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Child abuse — other considerations in pediatric fractures emphasize that some infants and children sustain fractures due to increased bone fragility, and clinicians should consider alternative etiologies. Perform a differential diagnosis of common conditions affecting bone strength, especially when the history suggests a mechanism other than PCA. Conditions that increase the propensity for fracture include collagen disorders such as osteogenesis imperfecta, malnutrition and deficiencies (e.g., rickets and scurvy), chronic renal disease, or any condition that subjects the child to prolonged immobility (e.g., severely involved cerebral palsy). A child with severely involved spastic cerebral palsy and low bone mineral density could potentially develop a femur fracture from routine care such as transferring or diapering. Children with osteogenesis imperfecta can present with multiple fractures in various locations with seemingly minor trauma. Fractures can also occur in neonates during vaginal or caesarian deliveries (e.g., difficult deliveries due to shoulder dystocia) that are discovered in later stages of healing and misinterpreted for abuse. Premature infants requiring extensive and prolonged neonatal ICU support are also are at risk of osteopenia and fractures in the first few months of life. For all children presenting with fractures, consider the possibility of a less common condition that can explain the fractures present.

### The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes [^113dCzsV]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Ehlers-Danlos syndrome:

- **Definition**: EDS is a group of inherited connective tissue disorders characterized by hyperextensible skin, hypermobile joints, and tissue fragility.
- **Pathophysiology**: EDS results from defects in collagen synthesis or structure, leading to weakened connective tissues. Mutations in genes such as COL5A1, COL5A2, COL3A1, COL1A1, and COL1A2 are implicated in different subtypes, affecting the primary structure and later processing of type I, III, and V collagens.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of EDS is believed to be underestimated, ranging from 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 400,000, depending on the subtype.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for EDS include a family history of the disorder, as it may be inherited in some cases depending on the subtype. It may also be associated with other genetic disorders or rheumatological diseases.
- **Disease course**: The syndrome is classified into several subtypes based on clinical presentation and genetic mutations, with the most common being the hypermobile, classical, and vascular types. Common features include joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, easy bruising, and Marfanoid habitus. The vascular type is particularly severe, with risks of arterial rupture, organ rupture, and early mortality. Other complications can include chronic pain, joint dislocations, and early-onset osteoarthritis. Associated systemic findings include anxiety disorders, fatigue, orthostatic intolerance, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and pelvic and bladder dysfunction. In addition to the general features, specific subtypes may present with unique clinical manifestations. For instance, the hypermobility type caused by TNXB haploinsufficiency is associated with mild-to-moderate neuromuscular involvement, including muscle weakness, myalgia, and easy fatigability. The periodontal subtype, caused by mutations in C1R and C1S genes, is characterized by early severe periodontitis and gingival recession.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis depends on the subtype and severity of the manifestations. While patients with the hypermobile and classical types may have a normal lifespan, vascular type is associated with an increased risk of life-threatening complications such as arterial rupture.

### The role of prenatal ultrasound and added value of post-mortem radiographic imaging with X-ray and CT in suspected fetal skeletal dysplasia [^116JLb7w]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Medium credibility.

3.3 Radiographic Imaging Ex Utero

Additional radiographic imaging (X‐ray and CT) was performed postmortem in 16 of the 27 terminated pregnancies, seven of which were first‐trimester terminations. In addition, the results of imaging studies were available from five liveborn children. Radiographic imaging was not performed during the perinatal period for children with mild phenotypes since it was unnecessary to expose them to radiation. When genetic diagnosis was confirmed and pregnancy was terminated, radiographic imaging was not routinely performed (Figure 3).

FIGURE 3
Radiographic imaging after termination of pregnancy (TOP) or after birth (during neonatal period/during first year of life).

X‐ray and especially 3D‐CT appeared to be superior to US in identifying spinal and thoracic anomalies in both the first and second trimesters of pregnancy (Table 1a and 1b). Especially, deformities, fractures and shortening of ribs were often missed with US. In nine cases, these changes had not been detected at all with US. Additionally, abnormalities and fractures of vertebrae and scapular, clavicular and acromial defects were poorly detected, and in some cases, even long bone fractures and deformities were missed with US. Occasionally bowing of long bones seen with US later appeared as fractures in radiographs, which also showed more detailed abnormalities such as widening of metaphyses and diaphyses. For instance, in one case with COL1A2 ‐related severe perinatal form of Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) (Sillence type 2), US showed shortening and bowing of the long bones indicating skeletal dysplasia, but femoral fractures and multiple rib fractures diagnostic to severe OI were only detected with X‐ray/CT (Figure 4). In other OI cases, some fractures and for example poor ossification of the skull were visible with US, but phenotypic data provided by X‐ray/CT was much more detailed.

### Skeletal demineralization and fractures caused by fetal magnesium toxicity [^116PDA1B]. Journal of Perinatology (2006). Low credibility.

Two surviving female infants, born from a triplet pregnancy at 30 weeks gestation, were noted to have severe osteopenia and multiple fractures diagnosed at 20 days of age. Their mother had been treated for preterm labor with intravenous magnesium sulfate from week 22 until their birth at 30 weeks gestation. At birth, the triplets exhibited craniotabes with enlarged fontanelles and sutures. All developed Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) and the two surviving infants required prolonged respiratory support. Serum calcium and phosphate levels were normal and alkaline phosphatase levels were increased. The infants were treated with supplements of calcium and phosphorous, with resultant healing of the multiple fractures without deformity. Fetal magnesium toxicity impairs bone mineralization and can lead to serious bone demineralization that may cause fractures in the newborn period that complicate recovery from respiratory disease. Early recognition and treatment may minimize complications related to osteopenia caused by fetal magnesium toxicity.

### Pediatric ribs: a spectrum of abnormalities [^112FqnNG]. Radiographics (2002). Low credibility.

The manifestations of many congenital and acquired conditions can be seen in the ribs of children. Normal variants are usually clinically insignificant; they are occasionally palpated at clinical examination or detected incidentally at chest radiography. Signs of abnormality can appear in the ribs as variations in number, size, mineralization, and shape. These changes can be focal or generalized. Abnormalities detected in the ribs may be the initial indication of previously unsuspected systemic disease. The ribs can yield important diagnostic clues in the work-up of patients with congenital bone dysplasias, acquired metabolic diseases, iatrogenic conditions, trauma (especially child abuse), infection, and neoplasms. Routine evaluation of the ribs on every chest radiograph is important so that valuable diagnostic data will not be overlooked. The diagnostic information obtained from evaluation of the ribs can help tailor the radiologic and laboratory studies that may be necessary to complete a patient's diagnostic work-up.

Pediatric considerations — chest computed tomography (CT): For pediatric patients, use chest CT more selectively to reduce unnecessary imaging. For the child with no, or only minor abnormalities on chest radiograph (for example, simple pneumothorax or hemothorax, pulmonary contusion, or isolated rib fractures), chest CT is reported to have no impact on subsequent management. A chest CT is recommended for children with an abnormal mediastinal contour to an age-appropriate shaped chest.

### Novel compound heterozygous variants in thegene in a child with osteogenesis imperfecta and recurrent acute liver failure [^1124Ytg3]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) consists of a group of genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous diseases characterised by bone fragility. Recent improvement in gene sequencing methods has helped us identify rare forms of OI that are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Paediatric endocrinology was consulted on a newborn girl with multiple fractures and wavy thin ribs noted on X-rays. In addition to the bone phenotype, she also has short stature and recurrent acute liver failure (ALF) episodes triggered by intercurrent illness. Whole exome sequencing revealed two novel compound heterozygous variants in neuroblastoma amplified sequence (NBAS) gene. NBAS gene codes for a protein that is involved in nonsense-mediated decay pathway and retrograde transport of proteins from Golgi to endoplasmic reticulum. Recognition of pathogenic variants in this gene as a rare cause of autosomal recessive OI and recurrent ALF has important therapeutic implications.

### Rapid whole genome sequencing impacts care and resource utilization in infants with congenital heart disease [^115kodpK]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Rapid WGS has been described as a powerful diagnostic tool in multiple intensive care settings. The field continues to investigate different areas to help guide implementation of rapid WGS including the benefits of singleton versus trio testing, best platforms, and, ultimately, the clinical and economic utility of this testing. Furthermore, determining which patient population would benefit from this comprehensive genome testing approach is critical to ensure resources are optimally utilized.

CHD is the most common and a costly congenital disorder and can be associated with significant long-term functional impairment. In addition to the cardiovascular defect some patients also tend to have other organ system involvement. While additional structural congenital anomalies are relatively easier to ascertain, immune and endocrine system effects may not be evaluated until late in the course of illness. Furthermore, neurodevelopmental disorders are infrequently ascertained in early infancy. Particular effort is made to understand and improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with CHD. It is imperative to understand the underlying etiology of disease in order to provide optimal care.

Children with CHD and genetic syndromes are at increased risk of surgical morbidity and mortality compared to other children with isolated CHD. Knowledge of the child's underlying genetic condition not only helps the clinician minimize risks but also allows for more informed discussions with parents prior to medical and surgical interventions. This was evident in the care of an infant who was ultimately diagnosed with Coffin–Siris syndrome after prolonged hospitalization with multiple complications including ECMO, frequent infections, and multiple surgical interventions.

A frequent difficulty in making a genetic diagnosis and limitation to phenotype driven gene/gene panel testing in the newborn is the incomplete phenotype relative to textbook descriptions of disease. This was evidenced by the fact that the incorrect genetic test was recommended for three of the seven patients (43%) who received formal clinical genetics consultations. For example, the newborn diagnosed with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets syndrome would likely not have been diagnosed until the appearance of leg bowing at weight-bearing age. Rickets diagnosis after 5 years of age is associated with increased fractures, increased surgeries, and final growth percentile of < 10 th (most < 3 rd) –. This diagnosis also informed familial decision-making given X-linked inheritance.

### Syndromes with congenital brittle bones [^115V4HBN]. BMC Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Type III OI (Severe OI)

These patients have triangular face, product of an enlarged head and under-development of the facial bones. They also have chest deformities, markedly short stature, and severe deformities of the long bones, vertebral fractures, and scoliosis. They are frequently wheelchair-bound, although some are able to walk with aids. Prenatal diagnosis is hard but sometimes possible using ultrasonography. Long bones are severely bowed, and altered structure of the growth plates lead to a particular structural alteration of the metaphyses and epiphyses described a "popcorn appearance". Severe cases may have respiratory complications that can compromise survival.

Type II OI

In this form of OI, most newborns do not survive the perinatal period. Causes of death are malformations or hemorrhages of the central nervous system, extreme fragility of the ribs, or pulmonary hypoplasia. The infants present with multiple intra-uterine fractures, including skull, long bones and vertebrae, beaded ribs, and severe deformity of the long bones. Prenatal differential diagnosis between severe and lethal OI is usually not possible. Extremely severe cases can be dismembered during delivery. The vast majority of cases are autosomal dominant new mutations. It has been suggested that there may be different clinical forms of lethal OI. Despite severity, a few patients have survived for several years.

### An expert perspective on phosphate dysregulation with a focus on chronic hypophosphatemia [^116cp6hG]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Skeletal deficits

Rickets

In healthy children, phosphate‐regulated apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes at the growth plate is required for bone mineralization and lengthening. In chronic hypophosphatemia, this apoptosis is arrested, leading to deficient mineralization and accumulation of osteoid at the metaphysis, commonly described as rickets.

Because of the high phosphate requirements needed to maintain normal longitudinal growth velocity, growth impairment is often a presenting feature of some forms of genetic hypophosphatemia, such that despite normal measurements at birth, growth declines within the first few months of life.

Other related observations are deformities of the weight‐bearing long bones of the lower limbs, including genu varum (outward bowing of the lower leg)/valgus (inward bowing) with associated gait abnormalities, reduced efficiency of walking, and fatigue. Lower extremity torsion and rotation may also be found in patients with XLH.

Osteomalacia

Osteomalacia is a condition of impaired mineralization due to insufficient phosphate, calcium, and vitamin D, leading to hypomineralized soft bones in both children and adults. In infancy and childhood, the soft bones can bend when mechanical load is applied (eg, when a child starts to stand or toddle), resulting in lower limb deformities. Osteomalacia can arise due to chronic hypophosphatemia, where it is associated with impaired bone turnover, diffuse bone pain, and an increased risk of fractures and pseudofractures (Looser zones). Pseudofractures are observed radiologically as transverse zones of rarefaction and most often occur in the weight‐bearing bones of the lower extremities, especially the shaft of the femur or tibia. Chronic hypophosphatemia may also delay healing of pseudofractures and fractures.

Joint complications

Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease of the synovial joints characterized by progressive deterioration and loss of articular cartilage with concomitant structural and functional changes in the entire joint and pain, both impacting on mobility. These have been observed in adults with diseases characterized by chronic hypophosphatemia, eg, XLH, and may be caused by long‐term abnormal mechanical loading of joints resulting from skeletal deformities that occurred during childhood. Work in animal models of XLH have linked osteoarthropathy with FGF23 signaling that was not mediated by hypophosphatemia, and investigation is ongoing.

### Stakeholder views and attitudes towards prenatal and postnatal transplantation of fetal mesenchymal stem cells to treat osteogenesis imperfecta [^1127aXiy]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a rare metabolic bone disorder that affects ~1 in 20,000 births. Common features include bone fragility, osteopenia, short stature, atypical skeletal development, brittle teeth, hearing loss and hypermobile joints. Variants in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes that either reduce the amount of collagen or impact on collagen structure are causal in 85–90% of cases. OI has been classified as mild (type 1), moderate (type 4), severe (type 3) or lethal (type 2). OI is a heterogeneous condition and severity varies widely, including between family members with the same genetic variant. Severe forms can sometimes be identified before birth when ultrasound detects fractures, reduced fetal growth or bowing of the limbs.

There are no curative interventions for OI. Treatment options focus on reducing fractures and deformity, providing relief from pain and improving mobility and day-to-day function. Bisphosphonates are often offered when children have moderate to severe OI as they increase bone mineral density and improve bone strength and, as a result, reduce fracture risk and bone pain. Surgery, such as intramedullary rodding, maintains bony alignment and reduces fracture risks when long bones are bowed or if fractures are recurrent. Physical and occupational therapy are also commonly used to help with mobility and function.

Transplantation of fetal mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a new approach to treating OI that, although it will not cure the condition, does have the potential to modify severity. As OI can cause damage early in fetal life, prenatal or early post-natal (first year of life) stem cell transplantation (SCT) could help to ameliorate the disease process at a time of rapid skeletal development and before additional pathology occurs as a result of fractures. To date clinical experience with SCT for OI is limited, and further studies are needed. The Boost Brittle Bones Before Birth (BOOSTB4) Phase I/II clinical trial will examine the safety and, efficacy of SCT for severe OI. The aim of our study was to explore the views and attitudes of key stakeholders towards SCT and the proposed BOOSTB4 clinical trial.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^114N2tia]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Child abuse — skeletal survey imaging protocol and follow-up state that the complete survey includes 22 images, oblique views of the chest are included because rib fractures are commonly non-displaced and very subtle on radiographs, and a full body "babygram" is not an acceptable substitute. Obtain separate views of each humerus, forearm, hand, femur, leg, and foot; lateral views of long bones, anteroposterior (AP) and lateral views centered at selected joints, or a Towne view of the skull may also be helpful, and have the examination monitored by a pediatric radiologist or other appropriately trained radiologist to ensure that all necessary images are obtained and interpreted to clarify questionable findings. Consider a 99mTc bone scintigraphy if the radiographic skeletal survey is negative but the clinical suspicion is high. Because certain fractures (e.g., ribs, classic metaphyseal lesions) are difficult to detect when acute, a follow-up skeletal survey is advised approximately 2 weeks after the initial survey; up to 24% of young children with suspected abuse are found to have additional fractures at follow-up, and the findings increase confidence in the abuse diagnosis. Because fractures of the skull, spine, pelvis, hands, and feet are much less likely to be occult on the initial skeletal survey, studies suggest eliminating these views on the follow-up survey, and fracture healing can be estimated by the radiographic pattern using broad time frames: acute (< 1 week), recent (8–35 days), old (> 36 days).

### Osteogenesis imperfecta: a pediatric orthopedic perspective [^113B6cYn]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder related to a defect or deficiency in the production of type I collagen. It is characterized by brittle bones, fractures, spine and extremity deformity, and a host of extraskeletal manifestations. Type I collagen is present in bone, tendons, ligaments, skin, dentin, and the sclera of the eye and other connective tissues. Osteogenesis imperfecta includes a multitude of disease manifestations that may be present at birth or develop over time and vary depending on the severity of the disease. This article describes the disease presentation and management considerations from a pediatric orthopedic perspective.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Patients receiving OMNISCAN should be instructed to inform their physician if they:

are pregnant or breast feeding, or
have a history of renal and/or liver disease, convulsions, asthma or allergic respiratory disorders, or recent administration of gadolinium-based contrast.

GBCAs increase the risk for NSF among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. To counsel patients at risk for NSF:

Describe the clinical manifestations of NSF
Describe procedures to screen for the detection of renal impairment

Instruct the patients to contact their physician if they develop signs or symptoms of NSF following OMNISCAN administration such as burning, itching, swelling, scaling, hardening and tightening of the skin; red or dark patches on the skin; stiffness in joints with trouble moving, bending or straightening the arms, hands, legs or feet; pain deep in the hip bones or ribs; or muscle weakness.

Gadolinium Retention

Advise patients that gadolinium is retained for months or years in brain, bone, skin, and other organs in patients with normal renal function. The clinical consequences of retention are unknown. Retention depends on multiple factors and is greater following administration of linear GBCAs than following administration of macrocyclic GBCAs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### The role of prenatal ultrasound and added value of post-mortem radiographic imaging with X-ray and CT in suspected fetal skeletal dysplasia [^116w8jBH]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Skeletal dysplasias are a group of disorders affecting the development of bone and cartilage. Over 770 different disorders have been recognized to date with a total birth incidence of 1/5000. The genetic spectrum of skeletal dysplasias can differ significantly between populations. The most severe forms are associated with significant perinatal morbidity and mortality.

The primary diagnostic tool to identify fetal skeletal disease is prenatal ultrasound (US). Usually the first abnormal finding observed with US is shortening of the long bones. Other signs indicating skeletal disorder are bowing, poor mineralization, or fractures of the bones along with abnormalities in flat bones, vertebrae, and thorax. Nuchal translucency (NT) or fetal hydrops can also be associated with skeletal dysplasia.

Assessing the degree of severity of potential fetal skeletal dysplasia during pregnancy is often challenging due to the large number of possible diagnoses with variable and overlapping phenotypes. In the absence of an exact genetic diagnosis, the decision‐making relies on clinical assessment with US. Prenatal US has only 40%–68% diagnostic accuracy in detecting skeletal dysplasia and poor visibility due to for example maternal obesity can complicate the process. With appropriate criteria, US is quite accurate in distinguishing between lethal and non‐lethal types of the disease. The most accurate predictors of lethal skeletal dysplasia are 3D fetal lung volumes (< 5th percentile for gestational age), ratios of femur length to abdominal circumference (FL/AC < 0.16) and chest circumference to abdominal circumference (TC/AC < 0.6). Other features potentially indicating lethal disease include a bell‐shaped thorax, short ribs, severe femoral shortening, polyhydramnion and multiple fractures or underossification of the spine.

### Collagen transport and related pathways in osteogenesis imperfecta [^115vJ7Mi]. Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Osteogenesis Imperfecta: are we ready to classify it?

Osteogenesis Imperfecta, or brittle bone syndrome, is a rare genetic connective tissue disease. It is characterized by altered microarchitecture of the bone, which leads to fragility (Glorieux). In the more severe cases, patients also manifest a variable degree of skeletal dysplasia and short stature. Patients may also be affected by extraskeletal features such as dentinogenesis imperfecta, hearing loss and blue sclera (Van Dijk et al.). Cardiac valvulopathies and aortic dilatation are one of the most common cardiovascular aspects of OI (Ashournia et al.); altered diastolic function is also reported which may also predispose OI patients to higher risk for cardiovascular disease (Migliaccio et al; Radunovic and Steine). The prevalence of OI is approximately 1 in 15–20,000, qualifying as one of the most prevalent inherited skeletal disorders. Defects in collagen type I are central in the systemic pathology of the disease.

OI is a phenotypically and molecularly heterogeneous group of disorders (Forlino and Marini). Because of this variability, many researchers have attempted to develop models for its classification in an effort to aid its efficient communication and understanding. The most commonly used classification is the "Sillence classification", established by David Sillence (Sillence et al; Van Dijk et al.). This classification initially divided the disease in four different types based on the clinical findings and the mode of inheritance. OI type I is phenotypically classified as the mildest type of OI; this patient group experiences a variable number of bone fractures and usually blue sclerae (Van Dijk and Sillence). This is in great contrast to the most severe phenotype, classified as OI type II, characterized by prenatal onset of multiple fractures and deformity of the long bones and the ribs, resulting in perinatal lethality. In addition, OI type II is subdivided in three classes (A, B and C) based on differences in radiographic features (Gajko-Galicka). Type III is the most severe adult form of OI, with patients suffering from severe gradual deformity of the long bones and/or spine (Gajko-Galicka). The patient group diagnosed with type IV OI is the most phenotypically diverse, from mild to severe. Similar to the other types, the patients have fragile bones with and without progressive deformities of the long bones and spine (Sillence et al.).

### Birth-associated long-bone fractures [^114yaBcq]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the incidence and outcome of neonatal long-bone fractures at a tertiary teaching hospital.

Methods

A retrospective study of all neonates with long-bone fractures delivered at Jordan University Hospital between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2010.

Results

Among a total of 34 519 live births, 8 neonates had a long-bone fracture (incidence 0.23/1000 live births); of these, 6 had a femur fracture (0.17/1000 live births) and 2 had a humerus fracture (0.05/1000 live births). The route of delivery was emergency cesarean delivery for 6 infants, elective cesarean delivery for 1 infant, and the vaginal route for 1 infant. The mean birth weight was 2723g. All neonates weighed more than 2200g and their gestational age was more than 35weeks, with the exception of 1 neonate born at 31weeks weighing 1500g. The mean time interval from birth to fracture diagnosis was 1.5days. All fractures healed with no residual deformity.

Conclusion

Emergency cesarean delivery carries a higher risk of long-bone fracture than vaginal delivery. Prematurity, malpresentation, abnormal lie, and multiple pregnancies may predispose to long-bone fractures. The prognosis of birth-associated long-bone fractures is good.

### Radiographic features of osteogenesis imperfecta [^112aqosp]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Postnatal diagnosis of OI

OI encompasses a broad range of presentations, from virtually non-apparent forms to more severe ones, and some may go unnoticed for a long time. Positive diagnosis can be made clinically on the basis of skeletal and/or extraskeletal manifestations, but this is only the case in severe forms of OI. A family history of OI can also be helpful in arriving at a diagnosis. In fact, in most cases, imaging is required for diagnosis.

Extraskeletal manifestations

These are inconstant, but their recognition allows a quicker diagnosis of OI. Extraskeletal manifestations are diverse, related as they are to the ubiquitous presence of type I collagen in the human body: blue sclerae (mainly in type I OI); a greyish or yellowish aspect of the teeth, also called "dentinogenesis imperfecta" (mainly in type III OI); skin fragility; joint and ligament hyperlaxity; early hypoacusia; and cardiovascular abnormalities (particularly aortic valve disease). Less frequently, neurological abnormalities related to basilar impression and platybasia (mainly in type IV OI) or to direct involvement of neurovascular structures may be encountered.

Skeletal manifestations

OI is generally recognised in children presenting with multiple, repeated or unexplained fractures, especially when the causative trauma is minor or when there is no history of trauma. Other skeletal manifestations depend on the severity of the disease and may include short stature and progressive deformities of the spine (kyphosis, scoliosis), the rib cage or the lower limbs (discrepancy in length, bowing).

### Birth-related mid-posterior rib fractures in neonates: a report of three cases (and a possible fourth case) and a review of the literature [^113c2zPS]. Pediatric Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Posterior rib fractures in young children have a high positive predictive value for non-accidental injury (NAI). Combined data of five studies on birth trauma (115,756 live births) showed no cases of rib fractures resulting from birth trauma. There have, however, been sporadic cases reported in the literature.

Objective

We present three neonates with both posterior rib fractures and ipsilateral clavicular fractures resulting from birth trauma. A review of the literature is also presented. The common denominator and a possible mechanical aetiology are discussed.

Materials and Methods

In total, 13 cases of definitive birth-related posterior rib fractures were identified.

Results

Nearly all (9/10) posterior rib fractures were (as far as reported in the original publications) in the midline. In 12 of the 13 children, birth weight was high and in 7 children birth was complicated by shoulder dystocia. An interesting finding was that in cases where a clavicular fracture was present, this was on the ipsilateral side.

Conclusion

Radiologists, when presented with a neonate with posterior rib fractures, should be aware of this rare differential diagnosis.

### Radiographic characteristics of lower-extremity bowing in children [^116UUZ22]. Radiographics (2003). Low credibility.

Lower-extremity bowing is common in infants and children and can result from a variety of conditions. At radiography, developmental bowing shows varus angulation centered at the knee, "metaphyseal beaking", thickening of the medial tibial cortices, and tilted ankle joints. Tibia vara (Blount disease) demonstrates genu varum and depression of the proximal tibia medially. Congenital bowing manifests as posteromedial bowing with cortical thickening along the concavity of the curvature and, in some cases, diaphyseal broadening. In rickets, radiographic changes occur primarily at sites of rapid growth and are predominantly metaphyseal, with widening of the zone of provisional calcification. Achondroplasia is characterized by shortening and thickening of the long bones with metaphyseal flaring and cupping. In neurofibromatosis, there may be anterolateral bowing of the tibia, and there is often focal narrowing and intramedullary sclerosis or cystic change at the apex of the angulation. The tibia is typically involved at the junction of the middle and distal thirds. Osteogenesis imperfecta demonstrates bowing from softening due to osteoporosis and multiple fractures and typically involves the entire skeleton. In camptomelic dysplasia, lower-extremity bowing is associated with a short trunk, short limbs, and deficiencies in pelvic bone development. Recognition of these pathologic conditions is important for differentiating those that will resolve spontaneously from those that require surgery or other treatment.

### Retrospective evaluation and dating of non-accidental rib fractures in infants [^114UXEeb]. Clinical Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

To describe the sequential appearance of healing rib fractures on initial and follow-up radiographs using published guidelines in approximating the age of rib fractures in infants with the aim of establishing a more objective method of dating rib fractures by measuring the thickness of the callous formation.

Materials and Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of initial and follow-up digital skeletal surveys of infants less than 12 months of age performed between January 2008 and January 2012 at the University of California Davis Children's Hospital. Six radiological features of rib fractures evaluating the appearance of the callous formation (C stage) and fracture line (F stage) were assessed. Patients with osteogenesis imperfecta, known vitamin D deficiency, and skeletal or metabolic dysplasia were not included in the study. Thereafter, callous thickness was measured and recorded for each stage.

Results

Sixteen infants (age range 1–11 months, seven males and nine females) with 23 rib fractures were analysed. The thickness of the callous formation follows a predictable pattern advancing one stage after a 2-week follow-up with progressive callous thickening starting from stage 2, peaks at around stage 4, and then tapers and remodels until it almost disappears when the fracture is healed at stage 6.

Conclusion

It appears that rib fractures in infants follow a predictable pattern of healing. Measuring the thickness of the callous formation is a more objective way of guiding the radiologist in estimating the age of the fracture.

### Comprehensive approach to the management of the patient with multiple rib fractures: a review and introduction of a bundled rib fracture management protocol [^114hSPpJ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Fracture patterns and clinical outcomes

Rib fractures occur in ∼9–10% of patients with trauma, and are markers of severe bodily and solid organ injury. In addition to being associated with concomitant thoracic injuries, rib fractures are associated with head, extremity, abdominal, and blunt cardiac injuries. These patients have poor overall clinical outcomes, and are at increased risk for multiple complications. Thoracic complications of rib fractures are common, including pneumonia, pulmonary effusion, aspiration, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary emboli, and atelectasis or lobar collapse; these are important as targeted interventions may enable risk reductions. An evaluation of the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) from 1994 to 2003 identified a mortality rate of 10% and a 13% complication rate, of which 48% were pulmonary complications. Among 711 patients at a level II trauma center, 45% of patients with rib fracture experienced complications, including 35% sustaining pulmonary complications. In addition, 34% were discharged to a long-term care facility and 12% died; pulmonary complications accounted for 54% of late deaths within this population.

Table 3
Sillence types of OI*

* **Further subclassification can be made within each OI type**: subgroup A notation indicates no dentinogenesis imperfect; subgroup B notation indicates the presence of dentinogenesis imperfecta; OI = osteogenesis imperfecta.

The difficulty in differentiating CAN from bone disease is complicated by marked variability in the manifestations of "classic" findings. Three of our articles described patients with OI who had an atypical history and physical findings such as a lack of osteopenia (three of four), lack of wormian bones (nine of 28), and a lack of OI family history (21 of 33). Furthermore, the lack of dentinogenesis imperfecta has been suggested as a possible reason that milder forms of OI are mistaken for CAN. However, the largest series in our review (with 802 total cases) reported no difference between the groups of patient who were initially misdiagnosed with CAN as opposed to OI in terms of the presence of dentinogenesis imperfecta. Data were also pooled from these articles for the scleral color of these patients and family history (at the time of presentation with fracture) for the patients who were initially misclassified as CAN: 72.7% (24 of 33) of patients had an abnormal scleral color (blue, pale blue, or gray), 50% (three of six) of patients had a family history of multiple fractures, and 36.4% (12 of 33) of patients had a family history of OI yet were still misclassified as CAN victims. Substantial data examined fracture location in patients with OI misdiagnosed as CAN. From those papers, 18 of 27 patients with OI presented with femur fractures, nine with tibia fractures, eight with humerus fractures, four with clavicle fractures, and four with rib fractures. Patients with OI either had multiple fractures on presentation or had radiographic evidence of old fractures in 19 of the 27 patients.

In addition to fracture location, bone quality was considered by a subset of papers in our study. Patients with "temporary" brittle bone were noted to have metaphyseal abnormalities 76% of the time, rib fractures in 72% of cases, and periosteal reaction without fracture in 49% of cases. Patients in the metaphyseal dysplasia series had a variety of historical and radiographic signs such as bowing of long bones, diaphyseal sclerosis, and epiphyseal separation; these findings, along with notes that suggested trauma, led the authors to reclassify them as CAN.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^111eQGpZ]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Other imaging — children with suspected intentional injury: CT of the chest with intravenous (IV) contrast is recommended when clinical suspicion of intrathoracic vascular injury exists, whereas CT of the chest without contrast has higher sensitivity for rib fractures than radiograph but is considered an adjunctive exam and routine use is not recommended. Tc-99m whole-body bone scan is an adjunctive examination for the detection of fractures and has utility when clinical suspicion is high but the skeletal survey is negative or findings are equivocal or subtle; venipuncture is required for radiotracer injection and sedation is often required because image acquisition requires a stationary patient for a longer interval compared to other modalities. Ultrasound does not have a role in the imaging work-up of children with suspected intentional injury.

A woman in her 30s underwent a 17-week ultrasound which revealed short bowed long bones. Fetal CT at 28 weeks' gestation showed decreased ossification of the skull, a small bell-shaped thorax, hypoplastic vertebrae, and shortening and bowing of the long bones, leading to the diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type II. The newborn was delivered via caesarean delivery, and tracheal intubation was performed due to the respiratory distress. A heterozygous variant in COL1A1 (c.1679G > T, p. Gly358Val) was ascertained, confirming the diagnosis of OI type II. Cyclic intravenous pamidronate was started at 41 days old with dose modification and was successfully administered every month. Currently, the infant is 8months old without any new bone fracture. He was extubated successfully at 7months of age and is now stable using high flow nasal cannula. The efficacy, safety, and optimal dose and timing of cyclic pamidronate for OI type II remain undefined.

### Chest radiographs versus CT for the detection of rib fractures in children (DRIFT): a diagnostic accuracy observational study [^113uJ1dk]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Of the 35 reporters who took part in both stages of the study, the same fracture was identified by use of both CT and radiography 1280 times (irrespective of autopsy findings; appendix). Of these fractures seen by both detection methods, 531 (41.5%) were also present at autopsy. 3938 fractures were observed with radiography and that were not with CT (of which 1558 [39.6%] were present at autopsy), and 1742 fractures were only seen by use of CT and not by use of radiography (of which 275 [15.8%] were present at autopsy).
