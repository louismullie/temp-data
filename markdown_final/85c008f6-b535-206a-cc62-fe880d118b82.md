## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which statement correctly describes the cohesion-tension theory for the ascent of water in the xylem. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core mechanism of cohesion-tension and whether it relies on negative pressure generated by transpiration. Then, I should verify the direction of pressure gradients and whether water moves from high to low hydrostatic pressure in this system. Next, I will examine the role of cohesion versus cavitation and embolism formation. After that, I need to check the anatomy of xylem conduits and whether they are living or dead at maturity. Finally, I will compare each answer choice against these points and select the best option, correcting any misconceptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental mechanism. The cohesion-tension theory posits that water is pulled upward by negative pressure (tension) generated when water evaporates from leaves, creating a pressure gradient that draws water from soil to leaf with minimal energetic cost once xylem conduits are formed, and this has been directly demonstrated in synthetic systems that mimic transpiration-driven negative pressures of −1.0 MPa or lower [^92c31056] [^2699d60e].

> Wait, let me verify the direction of the pressure gradient. In the xylem, water moves from less negative (higher) to more negative (lower) hydrostatic pressure, so the direction is from higher to lower hydrostatic pressure in absolute terms, but the gradient is established by increasingly negative pressures toward the leaf, not by positive pressure pushing from a source to a sink; thus, stating water moves from high to low hydrostatic pressure is technically correct in magnitude terms but misleading for the cohesion-tension context, which is dominated by negative pressures rather than positive hydrostatic drive [^92c31056] [^2699d60e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about cohesion and embolisms. I initially thought cohesion might directly cause embolisms, but that would be backwards; cohesion refers to hydrogen bonding that keeps the water column intact under tension, whereas embolisms (cavitation) occur when the tensile strength is exceeded or air enters, breaking the continuity of the water column, so cohesion prevents, not causes, embolisms, and embolism risk rises with more negative pressures and xylem vulnerabilities, not with cohesion itself [^89d17e1f] [^be3821a7].

> I need to check the anatomy of the conducting elements. Xylem vessels are composed of hollow, dead cells at maturity, forming a low-resistance conduit for axial water transport; living cells are not the main conduit, and flow is governed by pressure gradients and hydraulic resistances including pit membranes between conduits, which can create heterogeneous pressure distributions in vivo [^31c30ab4] [^2699d60e].

> Now, I will examine each option carefully. Option A states that evaporation from leaf mesophyll generates tension in the water column, which aligns with the core of cohesion-tension and is supported by both plant studies and synthetic tree demonstrations of negative-pressure flow driven by evaporation [^92c31056] [^2699d60e]. Option B is misleading because, although the absolute hydrostatic pressure decreases toward the leaf, the system operates under negative pressures rather than a positive-pressure source-to-sink model, so framing it as high-to-low positive pressure misrepresents the mechanism [^92c31056]. Option C is incorrect because cohesion maintains the column integrity; embolisms arise from failure of that integrity under excessive tension or air entry, not from cohesion itself [^89d17e1f] [^be3821a7]. Option D is wrong because mature xylem conduits are dead and hollow, not living cells, and thus do not provide the main pathway via living tissue [^31c30ab4].

> Conclusion: The correct statement is A, as it accurately captures that transpiration from leaves generates the negative pressure (tension) that pulls water upward in the xylem according to the cohesion-tension theory [^92c31056] [^2699d60e].

---

The correct answer is **A. The evaporation of water from leaf mesophyll cells generates tension in the water column**. This is the core of the cohesion-tension theory: transpiration creates negative pressure (tension) that pulls water upward, and the cohesive property of water transmits this tension down the xylem column [^92c31056] [^89d17e1f]. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because water moves from **lower to higher (less negative) pressure** in the xylem, cohesion prevents — rather than causes — embolisms, and mature xylem conduits are **dead, not living** [^31c30ab4] [^be3821a7].

## Analysis of answer choices

### Option A: Evaporation of water from leaf mesophyll cells generates tension in the water column

This statement is **correct** and aligns with the cohesion-tension theory. Transpiration from leaves lowers leaf water potential, creating negative pressure (tension) that pulls water upward from the roots [^92c31056]. Water's cohesion transmits this tension down the xylem column, enabling ascent with minimal energy cost [^2699d60e].

---

### Option B: Water moves from a source region with high hydrostatic pressure to a sink region with low hydrostatic pressure

This is **incorrect**. In the xylem, water moves from regions of higher (less negative) to lower (more negative) pressure, opposite to the typical high-to-low pressure gradient. The gradient is driven by negative pressure from transpiration, not positive hydrostatic pressure [^92c31056].

---

### Option C: The cohesion of water molecules is responsible for the formation of embolisms (air bubbles) in the water column

This is **incorrect**. Cohesion keeps the water column intact; embolisms form when tension exceeds the liquid's tensile strength or when air enters via cavitation, disrupting continuity [^be3821a7]. Thus, cohesion prevents, rather than causes, embolisms.

---

### Option D: Living cells of the xylem provide the main conduit for the ascent of water

This is **incorrect**. Mature xylem vessels are dead, hollow conduits that provide a low-resistance path for water; living cells are not the main conduit, though they may influence hydraulic properties indirectly [^31c30ab4].

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **A**, as it accurately reflects the cohesion-tension mechanism: transpiration-generated tension pulls water upward, with cohesion maintaining the column integrity [^92c31056] [^89d17e1f].

Introduction

Plants lose over 400 H 2 O molecules in exchange for a single molecule of CO 2 to fuel photosynthesis. Large quantities of water must therefore be drawn from the soil and transported to the leaves to adequately support this exchange of atmospheric gases, and to prevent leaf desiccation. Xylem has evolved to accomplish long-distance water transport in plants with very little energetic cost once the initial investment in the xylem conduits is made, as it relies on the evaporation of H 2 O from the leaves to drive sap flow in response to the pressure gradient established by transpiration itself. Xylem acts as a porous medium, whose organization of void spaces (i.e. the volume within each xylem conduit) and resistances (e.g. the frictional resistance of the conduit walls, and the pit membranes that exist between adjacent conduits) determines how the pressure gradient propagates, and thus the rate and characteristics of sap flow to the leaves. While axially oriented and pipe-like in general, xylem conduits form a complex three-dimensional network embedded in an opaque matrix of both living and dead cell types, and are subject to strong negative liquid pressures, making direct observations of network structure and sap flow difficult. Despite the broadly accepted fundamentals of the Cohesion-Tension mechanism used to explain vascular plant water transport –, the spatial distribution of pressure gradients and the resulting patterns of sap flow within the xylem network remain poorly understood.

### The transpiration of water at negative pressures in a synthetic tree [^92c31056]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

Plant scientists believe that transpiration-the motion of water from the soil, through a vascular plant, and into the air-occurs by a passive, wicking mechanism. This mechanism is described by the cohesion-tension theory: loss of water by evaporation reduces the pressure of the liquid water within the leaf relative to atmospheric pressure; this reduced pressure pulls liquid water out of the soil and up the xylem to maintain hydration. Strikingly, the absolute pressure of the water within the xylem is often negative, such that the liquid is under tension and is thermodynamically metastable with respect to the vapour phase. Qualitatively, this mechanism is the same as that which drives fluid through the synthetic wicks that are key elements in technologies for heat transfer, fuel cells and portable chemical systems. Quantitatively, the differences in pressure generated in plants to drive flow can be more than a hundredfold larger than those generated in synthetic wicks. Here we present the design and operation of a microfluidic system formed in a synthetic hydrogel. This synthetic 'tree' captures the main attributes of transpiration in plants: transduction of subsaturation in the vapour phase of water into negative pressures in the liquid phase, stabilization and flow of liquid water at large negative pressures (-1.0 MPa or lower), continuous heat transfer with the evaporation of liquid water at negative pressure, and continuous extraction of liquid water from subsaturated sources. This development opens the opportunity for technological uses of water under tension and for new experimental studies of the liquid state of water.

### In vivo pressure gradient heterogeneity increases flow contribution of small diameter vessels in grapevine [^31c30ab4]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Angiosperms transport most water through long, narrow conduits called vessels, each comprised of the continuous lumina (void spaces) of an axially oriented series of hollow cells that are dead at maturity. Flow between vessels is facilitated by perforated walls where vessels are adjacent, including at overlapping tapered vessel endings. Because the vessels are nearly circular in cross-section, water transport is often approximated with the Hagen–Poiseuille (HP) equation, which describes liquid flow rates in cylindrical pipes where volume flow rate is proportional to the radius raised to the 4 th power, such that a small increase in radius leads to a large increase in flow. This framework shows good agreement with experimental data on the hydraulic conductivity of excised stem segments if vessels are cut open at both ends and a uniform pressure gradient is applied to the network of vessels. For flow in actual xylem connected to both roots and leaves, maximum theoretical values based on HP predictions for an observed vessel diameter distribution must be reduced by empirical factors accounting for the resistance of the inter-conduit pit membranes embedded in the perforated end and side walls between adjacent vessels. An open question of fundamental importance to our understanding of the biology of plants still remains unanswered: do these reductions apply uniformly, such that vessel networks still follow a bulk form of the HP relation between radius and flow rate in planta?

Given the difficulty in resolving the three-dimensional complexity of the vessel network and their connections, analyses of xylem flow commonly assume the pressure gradient within the network to be homogeneous –. The current working model of xylem (Fig. 1a) simplifies its structure to parallel files of cylindrical conduits, whose lengths are uniform or independently drawn from an identical distribution, and whose tapered end walls overlap serially. Each idealized conduit consists of one lumen and one permeable end-wall placed in series, so that the total conduit resistance is simply the sum of the two resistance components, similar to Ohm’s Law. Water is carried along each file of conduits by an axial pressure gradient, crossing successive pairs of lumen and wall. Transverse heterogeneity in structure or pressure gradient is not considered. The simplicity of this conceptualization has made it a powerful working model, which underpins our understanding of xylem hydraulic propertiesas well as the methods we use to measure them,.

### Water transport in plants obeys Murray's law [^15d450fa]. Nature (2003). Excellent credibility.

The optimal water transport system in plants should maximize hydraulic conductance (which is proportional to photosynthesis) for a given investment in transport tissue. To investigate how this optimum may be achieved, we have performed computer simulations of the hydraulic conductance of a branched transport system. Here we show that the optimum network is not achieved by the commonly assumed pipe model of plant form, or its antecedent, da Vinci's rule. In these representations, the number and area of xylem conduits is constant at every branch rank. Instead, the optimum network has a minimum number of wide conduits at the base that feed an increasing number of narrower conduits distally. This follows from the application of Murray's law, which predicts the optimal taper of blood vessels in the cardiovascular system. Our measurements of plant xylem indicate that these conduits conform to the Murray's law optimum as long as they do not function additionally as supports for the plant body.

### In vivo pressure gradient heterogeneity increases flow contribution of small diameter vessels in grapevine [^98a8ee22]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Leaves lose approximately 400 H 2 O molecules for every 1 CO 2 gained during photosynthesis. Most long-distance water transport in plants, or xylem sap flow, serves to replace this water to prevent desiccation. Theory predicts that the largest vessels contribute disproportionately to overall sap flow because flow in pipe-like systems scales with the fourth power of radius. Here, we confront these theoretical flow predictions for a vessel network reconstructed from X-ray μCT imagery with in vivo flow MRI observations from the same sample of a first-year grapevine stem. Theoretical flow rate predictions based on vessel diameters are not supported. The heterogeneity of the vessel network gives rise to transverse pressure gradients that redirect flow from wide to narrow vessels, reducing the contribution of wide vessels to sap flow by 15% of the total. Our results call for an update of the current working model of the xylem to account for its heterogeneity.

### Water fluxes pattern growth and identity in shoot meristems [^5301d5a0]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Whereis the surface of the cell,its permeability with the apoplasm,its water potential; the sum is performed over the neighbor cellsadjacent to the cell, andis the common surface between cellsand, andthe water permeability. For parsimony, the osmotic pressure is assumed constant and homogeneous in the cells.

The coupling between these three equations results in a complex mathematical and computational problem for which we provided a numerical resolution in ref. Pressure and growth rate are not prescribed in this model, as they emerge from the interaction between fluxes and wall rheology, through the mechanical equilibrium. This model has already been quantitatively compared to biological data and predicted pressure and growth rate heterogeneities in the SAM.

Simulations presented in this article: The goal here is to represent the differential growth between organs and the central zone in the SAM (Fig. 2), with water supplied from below. In order to avoid boundary conditions between the SAM and the tissue underneath, we choose an initial circular geometry with 316 cells organized in concentric layers (Fig. 2D). This bidimensional mesh can be interpreted as a section through the SAM along the axis of the stem. Then, the identity of the cells is determined by the choice of the parameters of the model (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Table 1). Cells in the center, below L3, do not grow and are connected to a water source, they mimic the basal part of the SAM that is connected to vascular bundles providing water. Conversely, cells in L1–L3 layers are isolated from the water source (is three orders of magnitude lower) and grow thanks to the water from cells below; water mostly travels from cell to cell in L1–L3, which implies that they are in competition for water. The elastic modulus is 75% of cells below in L1–L3 and 200% in the outer wall in the initial growing phase. Starting from an initial state with zero elastic deformation, the tissue is put under pressure until the center cells have reached a stationary pressure, and cells in L1–L3 have started their plastic growth. This state is reached after 6.64 h in the simulation, and this marks the time. The detailed values of the parameters are given in Fig. 2D and Supplementary Table S1. The outgrowth of the primordium is then triggered by a further decrease of the elastic modulus in a few cells in L1–L3 (x 0.25 in the reference simulation, x 0.5, and x 0.75 in the parameter exploration below, Supplementary Fig. 3).

### Engineering and characterization of gymnosperm sapwood toward enabling the design of water filtration devices [^b87fbaff]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

To explain this observation, we note that the permeability of dried xylem filters is a function of not only the flow resistance of tracheids and pit membranes,, but also the tracheid interconnectivity. The length scale over which tracheids maintain connectivity depends on the degree to which the pit membranes get blocked during drying, and corresponds to cluster size in percolation theory –. Filters much thicker than this length scale of connectivity will be impermeable to flow, while those that are thinner, will have non-zero permeance (Fig. 2c). When filter thickness is comparable to this length scale, a highly nonlinear dependence of permeance on thickness that deviates strongly from Darcy’s law, is expected. The experimental results suggest that the length scale of connectivity in dried filters was ~0.25 inch, which also implies that any 0.25-inch section of a longer, impermeable filter should have non-zero permeance. This hypothesis was confirmed through experiments where 1.5-inch dried filters made from Eastern white pine were completely blocked, but 0.25-inch sections cut from the same blocked filters were permeable to flow (Fig. 2d).

The non-zero permeance of 0.25-inch sections in dried filters indicates that some pit membranes remain open (unaspirated) even after drying, i.e. the probability of pit aspiration blocking off a tracheid-tracheid interconnection upon drying is <1. We built a probabilistic model based on percolation theoryto capture the flow characteristics of a dried filter and better understand the dependence of permeance on filter thickness. We modeled the xylem as a node-edge network, where the tracheids and pits correspond to the nodes and edges, respectively (Fig. 2c). The model associated a probability p for an edge being broken, which in the case of a xylem filter represents the likelihood of connectivity between two tracheids being broken by pit aspiration. Simulations of this percolation model in a simplified, 2-D xylem network using MATLAB corroborated experimental observations; for a given pit aspiration probability, the connectivity (and thus the permeance) dropped to zero beyond a critical filter thickness (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Further, the model suggested that the converse should also be true, i.e. for a given filter thickness, there exists a critical probability p = p c, at which there is transition from zero to non-zero permeance (Fig. 2e, see Supplementary Note 2 for model details).

### Water fluxes pattern growth and identity in shoot meristems [^d8aee724]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Even in narrow domains of the SAM, hydraulic properties such as turgor pressure are heterogeneous and depend e.g. on tissue topology. Our complementary finding of shrinking domains next to fast-growing sectors supports the long-proposed hypothesis of growth-induced water potentials and water transport across the tissue. Thus, late boundaries shrinkage is partly a hydraulic consequence of organ outgrowth, which contributes to the final tissue topography. This makes water a patterning factor at the shoot apex acting in synergy with mechanical and biochemical cues.

Taken together, our results open a new avenue of research on the role of water flux as an instructive factor in patterning cell identity in meristems and beyond. While the example of the deep boundary may appear as an extreme case due to strong tissue curvature, we believe that such shrinkage might be more widespread. In this work, we could observe this effect in the region below the growing organs in non-dissected shoot apices. Such water fluxes may, in turn, have many impacts on patterning tissue growth and identity. For instance, it has recently been shown that the inhibition of lateral roots during xerobranching response to dry soil, is controlled by a change in internal fluxes that reshapes hormonal gradients. It is thus possible that, despite being less detectable, water fluxes contribute to the patterning of many more tissues in plants, and likely in other kingdoms too. For instance, osmolarity can impact membrane tension and cell polarity, with shared mechanisms between plants and animals. One could imagine that water fluxes also contribute to tissue patterning in animal embryos, with a similar impact on gene expression and chromatin signatures.

### Droplet superpropulsion in an energetically constrained insect [^63a3ed6a]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Consumption of nutrients and subsequent waste elimination are hallmark functionalities of a living organism. Although fluid feeding in insects (moths, mosquitoes, leafhoppers) has received considerable attention since Darwin’s time, little is known about the science and biofluid dynamics phenomena associated with waste elimination, despite having important ecological, morphological and evolutionary implications. Specifically, we focus on how excretion influences small-bodied animals’ behavior, morphology, and energetics since they face unique challenges due to their high metabolic rateand physical limits set by the natural world. Millimeter-sized xylem-feeding insects exemplified here with sharpshooter insects (Cicadellidea) face dual fluid dynamic challenges of surface tension due to their small size and energy constraints due to their xylem sap diet. Plant’s xylem sap is very poor in nutritional compounds (95% water) and energetically costly to pump out since it is under negative tension(≤ − 1 M P a). To survive on this frugal diet, sharpshooter insects use large cibarial muscles and an efficient digestive system (filter chamber) to extract and filter large volumes of the xylem fluid (up to 300 × body weight/day, compared to ~1/40 × body weight/day for humans). Subsequently, sharpshooters must constantly and efficiently excrete their fluidic waste (~99% water, ‘leafhopper rain’), contributing to their role as plant disease vectors. Here, we ask: what are the fluidic, energetic, and biomechanical principles that enable tiny xylem sap-feeding insects to survive on a nutrient-sparse diet?

### Leaf-level coordination principles propagate to the ecosystem scale [^310de94e]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The high number of retained axes (6) shows that multiple dimensions need to be considered when performing such analyses at the ecosystem scale. In particular, additional dimensions (beyond the second component) could hint at secondary effects of e.g. water transport within the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum, or water storage. In fact, canopy height and stem-specific density are indirectly linked to plant hydraulics, especially in trees. For instance, canopy height relates to the water potentials in the plant and is inversely proportional to the transpiration rate in Darcy’s law. At the same time, canopy height and stem-specific density in trees are constrained by hydraulic limitations such as cavitation risk. The additional relationships uncovered by the third component could characterize how water is transported through the plant vessels and stored in wood tissues. In the following section related to the least-cost hypothesis, we show that the dimension related to water is indeed important. Other hidden mechanisms that are not apparent with this set of variables, such as soil chemical and physical characteristics, likely play an important role in defining PCs beyond the first two dimensions. Still, we would need consistent measurements across the network to resolve such limitations,.

Our results are partly in line with recent literature describing three main components related to productivity, water, and carbon use. Compared to Migliavacca et al. we include additional structural and chemical variables, and we find similar components for productivity and water properties in our analog of the global spectrum of plant form and function. Additionally, we explain a higher proportion of variance over the first three components and highlight the importance of the structure and size of vegetation within the ecosystem as a secondary but crucial component.

The exclusion of non-forest sites leads only to minor changes to our results, in line with a recent study that expands on trait coordination at the leaf scale and compares woody and non-woody species.

While previous studies already highlighted the striking similarity of community-level relationships compared to the plant-level trade-offs of Díaz’s global spectrum, we find that the same is true for whole-ecosystem relationships between community-weighted averages of plant traits and ecosystem functions inferred using surface–atmosphere measurements. We conclude that the same eco-evolutionary constraints affecting individual plant fitness and community assemblages also apply to whole ecosystems.

### Design of a unidirectional water valve in tillandsia [^9a139862]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

To explain the role of the shield walls in resisting evaporation, we establish first that they are, as expected, highly hygroscopic (Fig. 3f, Supplementary Fig. 2 f). The moisture content in the wall is as much as 35% of the dry weight at RH = 100% but decreases sharply as the relative humidity drops from 100% to 50% (Fig. 3f, Supplementary Fig. 2 f). Hygroscopic materials such as cellulose are known to show a water permeability varying with their own moisture content. This singular physical property arises from the presence of hydroxyl groups on which water molecules adsorb, forming a third phase of bound water, alongside the vapor and liquid phases. The presence of bound water swells the cellulose network thus increasing its porosity,. The net result of these interactions is a resistance to the transport of water that varies roughly exponentially with the moisture content of the cellulosic material (Fig. 3f inset, Supplementary Fig. 9). This variable conductance of the trichome shield could explain in part why the leaf’s conductance to water vapor depends strongly on the ambient relative humidity (Fig. 2b). In summary, our results support the following mechanism for the conductance asymmetry: the entry of water occurs in the liquid phase with the main resistance given by the plasma membrane of the foot cell (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Note 1), while the exit of water takes place in the vapor phase with the main resistance to evaporation coming from the diffusion of water through the thick shield walls.

### Non-invasive hydrodynamic imaging in plant roots at cellular resolution [^8505e031]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The same principle is used to find parameter values for the diffusion coefficients of primary cell walls (D w), plasmodesmata (D PD), xylem vessels (D x), and for the xylem axial water flow rate associated to each trace (Q xyl). Overall, simulated D 2 O dynamics are quite sensitive to the type of apoplastic barrier and to Q xyl, which has two consequences: (i) measured D 2 O traces can be expected to be sensitive to xylem water flow rate, which is a requisite for our enterprise of quantifying such fluxes in living tissues based on D 2 O traces, and (ii) in plants with different apoplastic barriers, similar D 2 O traces may have been driven by substantially different values of xylem water flow rates (as confirmed in Fig. 2F, G) and vice versa. Absolute values of D 2 O content would be hard to capture experimentally due to variations in the instrument transfer function between samples and fluctuations in laser power over the weeks to months during which the experiments took place. Therefore, we focus on reproducing the shape of the normalized wash-out traces (linearly transformed to start at a value of one, and end at a value of zero, 600 s after the start of the wash-out phase, Fig. 2F). Interestingly, unlike absolute fractions of D 2 O in simulated wash-out traces, the normalized curves do not vary substantially when scaling root length with xylem water flow rate (see Supplementary Fig. 8) while the sensitivity to the type of apoplastic barrier remains (see Supplementary Fig. 9). Thus, in order to save computing time and resources, the inverse modeling loop is conducted on a shorter virtual root of 0.15 cm (15 stacks), with 0.05 cm exposed to D 2 O during the wash-in phase (replaced by H 2 O during the wash-out phase), 0.05 cm through the barrier separating distal from proximal pools of D 2 O/H 2 O, and 0.05 cm in the proximal H 2 O pool. The distribution of measured and simulated wash-out traces (average and ±1 standard deviation area) are shown in Fig. 2F, as well as individually in Supplementary Fig. 5 – 7. Optimal parameter values that allowed reaching these fits are displayed in Supplementary Table 2. Note that as there is experimental data for 51 wash-out traces, and 54 wash-out parameters (the diffusion coefficients being conserved across simulated traces), the average number of parameters per experimental trace is 1.06.

### Barrier properties of nup98 FG phases ruled by FG motif identity and inter-FG spacer length [^72a37453]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Finally, ten other FG Nups (Nups 358, 214, 153, 62, 58, 54, 50, 42, Pom121, and Ganp in humans) provide another 12 Megadalton in FG mass. This increases the FG phase volume and should reduce the shape-changing effect of surface tension. We do not expect a homogenous mixing between all these FG domains because their anchor points already dictate a spatial separation and because these domains come with a range of cohesivity. The most cohesive ones will co-phase-separate, forming the barrier’s core. The less cohesive and more water-soluble ones, however, should stay more peripheral, reduce (in a surfactant-analogous manner) the surface tension at the water-FG interface, and thereby stabilize the arrangement of a thin cohesive FG layer further. A nice illustration of this principle is soap allowing water to form thin films on flat plastic rings or as soap bubbles.

### In vivo pressure gradient heterogeneity increases flow contribution of small diameter vessels in grapevine [^fdfd28e0]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 1 
Idealizations of xylem anatomy vs. networks derived from X-ray micro-computed tomography (μCT).

a Current working model of xylem simplifies the xylem to parallel files of conduits of equal length, allowing it to be subdivided into units of one lumen and one end-wall resistance. Successive lumina are connected serially, with no connections across vessel files. b Four vessels (blue) segmented from a 3D stack of μCT images (at base). c Idealization of the same four vessels in the present model: each lumen is represented as circular in cross-section, with radius deduced from the data; connections (red) are placed at the centre of intervals where images show vessels to be connected.

While the homogeneous idealization allows us to approximate bulk xylem hydraulic properties,,, it cannot be used to determine properties of individual conduits, their mutual connections, and other details of the xylem network with important implications for xylem functioning. Such characteristics can strongly affect xylem hydraulic performance, including under stressful conditions that limit or impair flow. They have implications for the hypothesized trade-off between xylem hydraulic safety and efficiency, our understanding of xylem construction strategies, and optimal vessel diameter–length relationships for minimizing total xylem hydraulic resistivity. Similarly, the model cannot account for effects arising from patterns of vessel network arrangement and connectivity, although these both affect the functioning of individual conduits and how vessel properties scale to bulk xylem hydraulics –.

Real xylem is known to deviate from the homogeneous medium model in important ways at multiple scales. Lumen conductance is reduced from HP predictions due to variable conduit profile and radiusand the anatomy of connections between the cells that form a vessel. Inter-vessel connections are not placed exclusively at vessel ends, so that water will traverse more end walls than would be predicted from vessel length alone. Vessel endings can be irregularly spacedand concentrated in stem nodes, especially in young stems. The pattern of vessel connections commonly forms discrete clusters of conduits, aggregated in a non-random way, setting up parallel paths of diverse resistances. Vessel diameter, length, and connectivity can differ between xylem domains within a single cross-section, and the degree of integration or sectoriality across xylem domains is also variable, leading to varying levels of hydraulic isolation of plant parts –. Each such irregularity has the potential to significantly affect the overall xylem hydraulic function.

### Patterning and dynamics of membrane adhesion under hydraulic stress [^d833df75]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The local swelling of the interstice leads to loss of membrane adhesion even though bonds are not dissociated, as our experiments show. According to our theory, bond motion is driven by gradients of entropic and stretching chemical potentials, the latter of which strongly push bonds away from regions where membranes are drawn apart. The gradients in stretching chemical potential during blister formation are much larger than those of entropic origin generated in our FRAP experiments (Supplementary Fig. 1), hence explaining why bonds with reduced mobility at high concentrations appear immobilized during FRAP, but mobile during fracturing. This phenomenology is consistent with a microscopic picture of biased Brownian motion with stick-slip nonlinear friction,. Adhesion patches with high bond density behave similarly to dynamically arrested dense colloidal glasses, which attain fluid-like behavior only beyond a certain yield stress,. In the process of blister formation, membrane separation not only decreases locally bond concentration, but also increases the force born by individual bonds remaining in this region, leading to a non-monotonic traction-separation relation, T bonds (z). The traction reaches a maximumat critical separation, where k is the bond stiffness,, and then decreases to zero supporting a dissociated state (Fig. 2 a, inset). Accordingly, if the osmotic shock δ Π is large enough compared to, the uniform adhesion looses stability and partitions into separated bond-free and tightly adhered bond-rich phases by bond rearrangement.

The initial adhesion instability occurs at a certain distance from the edge, determined from the interplay between permeation and hydraulic confinement (gray map in Fig. 2 b). The theoretical model predicts initially axisymmetric ring-like fracture, which rapidly splits into droplet-like spherical blisters as a result of a symmetry-breaking transition akin to a Rayleigh-Plateau instability (Supplementary Movie 2 and Supplementary Fig. 5). The formation of blisters locally relaxes hydraulic pressure (red map in Fig. 2 b), and the resulting gradients drive interstitial water flow (Fig. 2 c and Supplementary Movie 3). Alongside the persistent water drainage towards the external medium at the edge of the adhesion patch, there are local and transient flows towards growing blisters or during blister coarsening, all of which decay in magnitude over time as the system approaches equilibrium. Analogously, gradients in bare membrane tension drive global lipid flows from the free-standing vesicle into the adhesion patch as blisters form, and local flows are required during blister fusion, growth and collapse (Supplementary Movie 3).

### Water fluxes pattern growth and identity in shoot meristems [^0eab05c4]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In multicellular organisms, tissue outgrowth creates a new water sink, modifying local hydraulic patterns. Although water fluxes are often considered passive by-products of development, their contribution to morphogenesis remains largely unexplored. Here, we mapped cell volumetric growth across the shoot apex in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that, as organs grow, a subpopulation of cells at the organ-meristem boundary shrinks. Growth simulations using a model that integrates hydraulics and mechanics revealed water fluxes and predicted a water deficit for boundary cells. In planta, a water-soluble dye preferentially allocated to fast-growing tissues and failed to enter the boundary domain. Cell shrinkage next to fast-growing domains was also robust to different growth conditions and different topographies. Finally, a molecular signature of water deficit at the boundary confirmed our conclusion. Taken together, we propose that the differential sink strength of emerging organs prescribes the hydraulic patterns that define boundary domains at the shoot apex.

Dry preservation of xylem filters

The knowledge of how xylem permeance is affected by thickness and pit aspiration probability (p) suggests two methods that could be used for preserving permeance in dried filters. First, permeance in dried filters may be retained by restricting their thickness to below a certain threshold value but above the tracheid length (~0.25 inches for Eastern white pine). Second, methods could be implemented to mitigate pit aspiration and thereby retain permeance in thicker filters.

Previous studies have shown that pit aspiration can be reduced by replacing the sap in the xylem with non-aqueous solvents, like alcohols, as it precludes water-mediated adhesion between the pit membrane and the cell wall during drying,,. To evaluate whether treatment with non-aqueous solvents can improve permeance, we compared the permeance of filters (made from Eastern white pine) that were dried after flushing with ethanol (‘ethanol-dried’) to those that were flushed with water before drying (‘water-dried’). Ethanol-dried filters exhibited higher permeance than their water-dried counterparts (Fig. 2f); the effect was more pronounced for thicker filters (0.5- and 1.0-inch) where water-dried filters were almost completely blocked whereas ethanol-dried filters retained permeance. Similar effects on permeance were observed on treating filters with other alcohols like isopropanol (see Supplementary Fig. 1b–f and Supplementary Note 3 for more details on solvent-based preservation). When benchmarked against commercial microfiltration membranes with similar pore size, the permeance of 0.25-inch ethanol-dried filters was comparable. The permeance range for commercial membranes is 0.002–0.05 L/h.cm 2.kPa – while 95% of the ethanol-dried filters from among 47 filters made from different Eastern white pine trees in Cambridge, MA, tested over a 2-year period consistently had permeance >0.005 L/h.cm 2.kPa (Supplementary Fig. 1b).

### Design of a unidirectional water valve in tillandsia [^99ac32f3]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Mechanism for the trichome’s conductance asymmetry

The design of the trichome forces water to move along three successive structural elements before entering the mesophyll: the thick shield walls, the lumen of the dome cell, the semipermeable membrane of the outermost foot cell (Fig. 3a). When exposed to fog water, the highly hygroscopic shield walls absorb the droplets by capillarity, allowing a continuous path of liquid water from the surface of the trichome to the cytoplasm of the foot cells; the flow of water being driven inward by an osmotic gradient (Fig. 3b). When fog disappears and the effective water potential of the environment falls below the water potential of the foot cells, thousands of trichomes now potentially act as capillary wicks (Fig. 3c). To avoid a wicking effect, it is crucial to rectify the movement of liquid water by making its outward flow impossible. Rectification requires to close two potential paths for the outward flow of liquid water. First, capillary flow within the wall space connecting the outer trichome to the mesophyll must be prevented. The Tillandsia trichomes achieve this with a precisely laid down cuticle covering the lateral walls of the dome cell and foot cells (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Fig. 2 b; see also refs.). Second, the liquid-gas interface must shift from the surface of the trichome shield to somewhere within the dome cell (Fig. 3c), so that the outward flow of water in the shield walls is by slow diffusion of the vapor phase instead of capillary wicking of liquid water. The liquid-gas interface will shift inwards if the rate of water evaporation at the trichome surface exceeds the rate at which water can be replenished by mass flow from the leaf mesophyll. To quantify the potential water flux through the trichome, we immersed leaves in CaClsolutions of various osmotic potentials. We noted that the water flux across the trichome is linear with respect to the osmotic potential and changes sign at a critical concentration of 0.24 M, equivalent to1.2 MPa of osmotic potential (Fig. 3e). Importantly, an external CaClconcentration of at least 3 M (14 MPa) is necessary to reach a liquid water flux equal to the rate of evaporation of free water at the trichome surface. Such a negative water potential cannot be generated in the liquid phase without using concentrations of solutes that far exceed the osmolarity of fog water. We conclude that the liquid mass flow through the trichome cannot match the typical rate of evaporation at the surface of the trichome. Thus, dry external conditions will necessarily force the liquid-gas interface to move deep into the trichome; ensuring that the outward movement of water involves diffusion of water vapor through the thick shield walls rather than capillary flow of liquid water.

### Dynamics of moisture diffusion and adsorption in plant cuticles including the role of cellulose [^08017dc4]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

There is still the question of how and why this high sorption takes place at high humidity, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. Cellulose is highly hygroscopic and can sorb 30% of water per dry weight, and polar polysaccharides, isolated from cuticles, can sorb even more at 49%. Regarding polysaccharides in cuticles, very little work has been done on composition, molecular characteristics, physical or chemical behaviour. Water molecules can adopt many interaction configurations of surrounding molecules due to the two hydrogen bond acceptor and donor sites. Water also provides many opportunities to be inserted into a polymer with the ability to play a multitude of roles. Many studies using different experimental techniques,– have found three types of hydrogen bonds: cellulose to other cellulose groups, water to cellulose groups, and water to other water molecules(where water is attached to cellulose, noted to be tetrahedral in shape). Above 80%RH, the share of bonds of water to other waters is the most abundant,. We surmise that at high humidity, above around 55%RH, the cellulose to hydrogen bonds are mostly full, so water to water bonds form, and water sorption increases significantly at high humidity. We note that more research needs to be done, with particular focus on cellulose at high humidity and why water to water bonds form more frequently at high humidities than other kinds of bonds.

### Non-invasive hydrodynamic imaging in plant roots at cellular resolution [^09dc3966]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

A key impediment to studying water-related mechanisms in plants is the inability to non-invasively image water fluxes in cells at high temporal and spatial resolution. Here, we report that Raman microspectroscopy, complemented by hydrodynamic modelling, can achieve this goal - monitoring hydrodynamics within living root tissues at cell- and sub-second-scale resolutions. Raman imaging of water-transporting xylem vessels in Arabidopsis thaliana mutant roots reveals faster xylem water transport in endodermal diffusion barrier mutants. Furthermore, transverse line scans across the root suggest water transported via the root xylem does not re-enter outer root tissues nor the surrounding soil when en-route to shoot tissues if endodermal diffusion barriers are intact, thereby separating 'two water worlds'.

### Natural variation at XND1 impacts root hydraulics and trade-off for stress responses in arabidopsis [^be3821a7]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Root water transport per se relies on several fundamental processes, often presented as sequential. Radial water flow, from the soil to the vasculature in the stele, is mediated through cell walls (apoplastic path) or from cell-to-cell. The latter path combines transcellular (across cell membranes and aquaporins) and symplastic (across plasmodesmata) transport. Water is then axially transported to the aerial parts through xylem vessels. The contexts in which root xylem can be hydraulically limiting are still debated. Based on Poiseuille’s law of laminar flow, it was calculated that under water sufficient conditions this tissue is supposedly not limiting with respect to root structures mediating radial transport. This may not be true in root tips, whereby vessels are not fully differentiated. Xylem cavitation under drought can also dramatically reduce plant hydraulic conductance and confer high plant vulnerability. Conversely, drought impacts xylem differentiation further supporting a crucial role of vascular transport in these conditions,. However, this view may not apply to certain species or under mild water stress since intraspecific variation of xylem size in major crops such as rice was not associated to any growth advantage, especially under water deficit. Thus, the links that xylem vessel differentiation establishes between root growth and development, hydraulics, and stress responses are not fully established. In contrast, detailed studies have revealed how positioning of xylem axes contributes to early vascular pattern formation and how subsequent differentiation of xylem tracheary elements occurs through cell clearance by programmed cell death and deposition of lignin in secondary cell walls. These developmental processes are controlled by regulatory networks involving NAC (NAM, ATAF1,2, and CUC2)and MYB (myeloblastosis)-type transcription factors. The former proteins have played a key evolutionary role in water-conducting structures from moss to vascular plants.

### Dynamics of moisture diffusion and adsorption in plant cuticles including the role of cellulose [^ff4cf48d]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

The model can simulate water sorption in the cuticle with any RH, temperature, content of cellulose on the surface, cuticle thickness, aqueous pore radius and pore density. The model can be theoretically applied to any plant species by modifying the constants. The model does not include any mechanisms that are specific to any one plant species, and future work could include validating the results for other plant species, noting that the trends for other plant species are very similar in Chamel et al. The model only requires one set of data to be trained on, and many parameters are available in the literature, as described in Supplementary Table 3.

When extending this model to an attached plant leaf (though not considering stomatal interactions), the previously held assumption was that the interior was 100% humidity or equivalent to liquid water. With these conditions, water loss to the environment may occur through the cuticle from the interior of the plant, when the environment is at low RHs. For transport in the other direction (inwards), new data (S. C. Wong and G. D. Farquhar, unpublished data) suggests that the humidity at the cuticle interior is <100%RH in some conditions, and this could assist with the modelling, when this work is expanded to the attached plant leaf. Considering transport in astomatous cuticles attached to leaves, at isothermal conditions, if the interior boundary condition or initial condition of the cuticle is <100%RH, water will enter the cuticle and subsequently the plant from the exterior, as water goes down the concentration gradient based on passive diffusion.

### Tight cohesion between glycolipid membranes results from balanced water-headgroup interactions [^a3c689e9]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Membrane systems that naturally occur as densely packed membrane stacks contain high amounts of glycolipids whose saccharide headgroups display multiple small electric dipoles in the form of hydroxyl groups. Experimentally, the hydration repulsion between glycolipid membranes is of much shorter range than that between zwitterionic phospholipids whose headgroups are dominated by a single large dipole. Using solvent-explicit molecular dynamics simulations, here we reproduce the experimentally observed, different pressure-versus-distance curves of phospholipid and glycolipid membrane stacks and show that the water uptake into the latter is solely driven by the hydrogen bond balance involved in non-ideal water/sugar mixing. Water structuring effects and lipid configurational perturbations, responsible for the longer-range repulsion between phospholipid membranes, are inoperative for the glycolipids. Our results explain the tight cohesion between glycolipid membranes at their swelling limit, which we here determine by neutron diffraction, and their unique interaction characteristics, which are essential for the biogenesis of photosynthetic membranes.

### A critical transition in leaf evolution facilitated the cretaceous angiosperm revolution [^300ea1e1]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

On the basis of a combination of data and modelling approaches, we propose and substantiate a novel mechanism to explain why evolving angiosperms could suddenly expand their leaf gas exchange capacity during the Cretaceous, and why conifers could not. This proposed mechanism is based on the consequences of morphological differences between planar-shaped hypostomatous (angiosperm) broad leaves and tubular shaped (conifer) needle leaves for the leaf interior transport paths of CO 2 and water (Fig. 1e). We note that also non-angiosperm species evolved planar-shaped leaves with a variety venation structures; however, these morphologies did not evolve the high D v values common to modern upper canopy angiosperm species. In our schematization of the broad-leaf morphology we differentiated between the Early Cretaceous angiosperm morphology with low D v and low D s and the modern angiosperm morphology with high D v and high D s. Common for all leaf morphologies is that CO 2 moves from the leaf boundary layer, through the stomatal pore and substomatal cavity into the intercellular airspaces. From there, CO 2 is absorbed in the mesophyll cells where photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts. Water moves from the soil through the plant’s water transport system up to the leaf veins before it evaporates and passes through the stomata. The exact mechanisms responsible for leaf interior water transport beyond the vein endings up to the stomata remain debated, but may involve a liquid-phase flow through the apoplast, across individual cells and through plasmodesmata with evaporation occurring close to the stomata in the substomatal cavitiy. Alternatively, evaporation may occur deeper inside the leaf throughout the mesophyllor close to the leaf vein endings, with water being transported as a vapour across the intercellular airspaces up to the stomata. Recent advances highlight the importance of this vapour-phase water transport mechanism in regulating short-term stomatal responses. Currently, neither the liquid-phase mechanism nor the vapour-phase mechanism can unambiguously be falsified. Moreover, both water transport mechanisms may occur in parallel or involve a mixed phase. We therefore explored the role of both mechanisms in relation to the sudden ecological success of angiosperms during the Cretaceous. We find that the period of rapid angiosperm evolution initiated after the leaf interior (post venous) transport path length for water became shorter than the leaf interior transport path length for CO 2. This transition may have enabled the evolving angiosperms to develop leaves with higher gas exchange capacities required to adapt to the Cretaceous CO 2 decline and outcompete previously dominant coniferous species in the upper canopy.

### Revised hypothesis and future perspectives [^ee8526eb]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Results from space have been unexpected and not predictable from the results of ground-based simulations. Therefore, the concept of how weightlessness and gravity modulates the regulation of body fluids must be revised and a new simulation model developed. The main questions to ask in the future are the following: Does weightlessness induce a diuresis and natriuresis during the initial hours of space flight leading to an extracellular and intravascular fluid volume deficit? Can sodium in excess be stored in a hitherto unknown way, particularly during space flight? Why are fluid and sodium retaining systems activated by spaceflight? Why are the renal responses to saline and water stimuli in space attenuated compared with those of ground simulations? How can the effects of weightlessness on fluid and electrolyte regulation be correctly simulated on the ground? The information obtained from space may be of relevance to fluid and electrolyte balance in edematous patients.

### Dynamics of moisture diffusion and adsorption in plant cuticles including the role of cellulose [^d5697ae2]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Food production may need to increase by 70% in the next 30 years, in order to feed the world’s estimated 9.7 billion people, and water loss from plants may hold one key, particularly in a time of changing climate. The plant cuticle is an important layer that covers much of the aerial parts of the plant, including the leaves, fruits and non-woody stems. The cuticle is a largely water-proof outer layer that forms the final defence of leaves in drought and at night, where stomata are closed and water loss needs to be kept to a minimum. In the plant cuticle, the mechanisms of transport including adsorption and diffusion of water are, to date, poorly understood. Understanding the transport mechanisms of water can inform a wide range of scenarios from foliar agrochemical application, plant biology and horticulture.

Several aspects of moisture transport in cuticles have been discovered over the past three decades, including salts on the cuticle surface that may lead to microscopic leaf wetness, (Tredenick, E. C. Stuart-Williams, H. & Enge, G. 2021, Materials on plant leaf surfaces are deliquescent in a variety of environments, unpublished), the water sorption capacity of celluloseand aqueous pores,. Moisture sorption in plant cuticles is important to consider and can influence the formation of cracks, leading to issues with food production of fruits and mechanical properties of the plant cuticle,. An experimental and theoretical approach has shown that the small fluxes associated with the cuticle are important to include in leaf gas exchange experiments. The work studied several plant species and a drought condition and found that, under certain conditions, cuticular transpiration was an important parameter to include in the calculations.

Solution of solute transport equations from the subcellular scale

The version of the micro-hydrological model MECHAused in this study solves three-dimensional transient solute transport in finite-difference hydraulic networks with the implicit Crank–Nicolson method. The hydraulic networks comprise symplastic and apoplastic “nodes”, where solute concentration is defined. Nodes are connected by hydraulic conductances (Fig. 2A) conveying water and solutes through paths including cell walls, plasma membranes, and plasmodesmata. Solutes may move along these paths with water mass flow (advection) or due to random molecular movements from a region of high to a region of low concentration (diffusion). In case the solute is deuterated water (D 2 O), no substantial metabolism, exclusion, or active transport applies so that advection and diffusion are the only relevant processes to consider when simulating its transport. For more elaborate simulations of the transport of major ions and associated processes in A. thaliana roots, an axisymmetric radial-longitudinal model has been developed by Foster and Miklavcic,. In MECHA, primary cell walls, plasma membranes, plasmodesmata, and xylem vessels are attributed to specific diffusion coefficients and hydraulic conductivities. The diffusivity of D 2 O within the protoplast is considered as non-limiting given its high porosity relative to membranes and plasmodesmata so that D 2 O concentration is assumed to freely equilibrate and thus to be uniform within each protoplast. In consequence, each protoplast only needs a single node at its center, while the apoplast is discretized in apoplastic blocks, according to cell wall geometry (parts of walls between two adjacent cells form one of these blocks). Apoplastic nodes are located at the center of each apoplastic block and at their junctions (see Fig. 2A, dotted and dashed white circles, respectively) for a total of 517 nodes in the apoplast and symplast within each two-dimensional plane in this study. In addition to connections between nodes within each transverse plane, apoplastic nodes from consecutive planes are axially connected through cell wall hydraulic conductances, while symplastic nodes are axially connected through two conductances in parallel standing for (i) plasmodesmata, and (ii) a cell wall and two plasma membrane layers. Unlike other apoplastic nodes connected by hydraulic conductances representative of primary (permeable) or secondary (hydrophobic) walls, the axial conductances of xylem vessels are calculated with the Poiseuille–Hagen law, based on their diameters determined from root sections.

### The structural origin of anomalous properties of liquid water [^c609a95c]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Water is unique in its number of unusual, often called anomalous, properties. When hot it is a normal simple liquid; however, close to ambient temperatures properties, such as the compressibility, begin to deviate and do so increasingly on further cooling. Clearly, these emerging properties are connected to its ability to form up to four well-defined hydrogen bonds allowing for different local structural arrangements. A wealth of new data from various experiments and simulations has recently become available. When taken together they point to a heterogeneous picture with fluctuations between two classes of local structural environments developing on temperature-dependent length scales.

### The structural origin of anomalous properties of liquid water [^83f90ba5]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

To gain fundamental understanding of the origin of these anomalies we need to address the instantaneous local structure of the liquid at various thermodynamic state points and establish how this structure couples to the dynamics of the molecular motion. The starting question is: on a larger scale liquid water is homogeneous, but is it also locally homogeneous or can it be heterogeneous (see Box 1)? Not in terms of a static structural picture, but induced by fluctuations on some length and time scales between specific classes of local structures. Many different plausible explanations exist for the unusual properties of water where maybe both homogeneous and heterogeneous models could be viable and sophisticated structural and dynamical experimental data are needed to determine their validity.

The other major question is: how large are distortions in the H-bonding network? In a locally homogeneous model the distortions should be around a near-tetrahedral H-bond arrangement, whereas in a heterogeneous model there would be distortions within each class of configurations in addition to the distinction in local structure between the classes. The more popular heterogeneous models build on fluctuations between two main classes of contrasting structures with notations such as tetrahedral and distorted, symmetrical and asymmetrical, locally favoured and normal, and low-density liquid (LDL) and high-density liquid (HDL)to mention the most recent proposals; these refer to the same two general structural classes where the notation reflects which specific properties are brought forward by the various experimentaland modellingtechniques.

Another much debated question is whether such heterogeneous fluctuating structures could develop into metastable macroscopic phases on extreme supercooling. Would this also lead to the existence of a second critical point? A liquid–liquid critical point (LLCP) has never been observed for a one-component fluid, but the apparent power-law divergence of compressibility and heat capacity on supercooling water has been proposed to be an indication of an LLCP.

Here we will review developments in the last few years around the question whether pure bulk water is structurally heterogeneous or homogeneous and how the answer may relate to its unique anomalous properties. At the end we propose a unified picture that can explain many observations in both the ambient and supercooled regimes.

### A critical transition in leaf evolution facilitated the cretaceous angiosperm revolution [^cca67416]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

We hypothesize that surpassing the critical D v gave evolving angiosperms a competitive advantage over conifers when falling C a required rising g smax via increases in D s and decreases in stomatal pore size. Key to the proposed mechanism is that the tradeoff between CO 2 transport and water vapour transport through the leaf interior is altered by differences in l CO 2 and l H 2 O(g) and, considering the three-dimensionality of diffusion, the size of the stomatal pore. This mechanism is illustrated for the diffusive fluxes of two conceptual substances (J X, J Y) with equal diffusivity (assumed unity) driven by an equal concentration difference (also assumed unity) over different radial distances (l X and l Y) from a single hemispherical pore with variable radius (r) (Fig. 3c), according to equation (14) (ref.). The first result shown by this example is that the diffusive flux is highest of that substance, which diffuses over the shortest radial distance. Interpreting this first result for leaf interior fluxes of CO 2 and water vapour around individual stomata indicates that the highest carbon flux relative to a water vapour flux can be achieved when l CO 2 is shorter than l H 2 O(g). This situation would resemble the diffusion distances in the schematised conifer and early angiosperm leaf morphologies (cf. Fig. 1e). The second result of this example is that a change in pore radius has the largest effect on the flux of the substance that diffuses over the shortest radial distance. The physiological implication of this second result is that when l H 2 O(g) < l CO 2, as in the schematised modern angiosperm leaf morphology, a decrease in pore size leads to a larger decrease in leaf interior water vapour transport than in CO 2 transport. On the basis of this mechanism, we propose that when angiosperms surpassed the critical D v (which rendered l H 2 O(g) < l CO 2) they could increase leaf interior CO 2 transport relative to leaf interior water vapour transport by developing leaves with more and smaller stomatal pores. The consequences of developing leaves with more and smaller stomata not only affected leaf interior gas transport, but also allowed evolving angiosperms to increase g smax due to the combined implications of Fick’s law and Stefan’s law. Hence, gradually surpassing the critical D v may have suddenly created an opportunity for evolving angiosperms to increase their stomatal gas exchange capacity.

### Life on the dry side: a roadmap to understanding desiccation tolerance and accelerating translational applications [^a6babbc9]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Relative Water Content (RWC): RWC measures the water content of a tissue relative to the weight of the tissue at full turgor, and is calculated using the equation: RWC = (Fwt-Dwt)/(FTwt-Dwt) × 100 where Fwt = Fresh weight, Dwt = Dry Weight and FTwt = Fresh weight at full turgor. Once the fresh weight of the tissue has been recorded the full turgor weight is obtained by submerging the sample in water until the sample has reached a constant weight (timing must be determined empirically for each tissue type). In some cases, the tissue can be floated on the surface or, in the case of some leaves, by submerging the specimen in water. The establishment of the full turgor weight should include removal of visible external water and be accomplished at 4 °C and in the dark to minimize the impact of respiratory and/or photosynthetic activity. The tissue dry weight is determined by oven drying the sample at 65 °C to 75 °C for 24 to 48 h. Although this is a useful measure in plant based studies, there is no direct way of relating RWC to the water potential of the tissue. However, RWC can be calculated from WC/WC F where WC F is the specific water content at full turgor. Drying to 10% RWC is roughly equivalent to −100 MPa. RWC also comes with a caveat in that it is not a very sensitive indicator of plant water status when the water deficit is not severe.

### Engineering and characterization of gymnosperm sapwood toward enabling the design of water filtration devices [^ff327256]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Diarrheal diseases caused by microbial contamination of water and poor sanitation are a global problem. In 2019, diarrheal diseases accounted for 1.5 million deaths per year, primarily in resource-limited settings amongst children under the age of five. Majority of the deaths (57.8%) are caused by bacterial pathogens, while water-borne viruses and protozoa account for 33.8% and 8.3% of the fatalities, respectively. Household water treatment (HWT) methods like chlorination, solar disinfection, and filtration can significantly reduce the risk of diarrheal diseases,. However, the adoption of these methods in resource-constrained settings is often hindered by their limited availability in remote locations, incompatibility with local sociocultural practices, high cost, or lack of suitable financing schemes –. In addition, the common perception that water that appears clear is safe for drinking, and the difficulty in appreciating the link between diarrheal diseases and poor water quality, also impede uptake –. Novel water treatment technologies that are inexpensive, readily available, socially acceptable, and effective against water-borne pathogens have the potential to address these challenges and improve access to safe drinking water.

Gymnosperm (non-flowering plants like conifers) wood, a common material that is widely available and traded across the globe, presents the intriguing possibility of creating inexpensive, sustainable, and socially acceptable filters to address this challenge –. The gymnosperm sapwood consists largely of xylem tissue that conducts sap, with longitudinally-oriented conduits called tracheids up to 10-mm long that are interconnected by ‘pit membranes’ with pore size ranging from 100 to 500 nm (Fig. 1a and b). Fluid flowing through a transverse section of a branch that is thicker than a single tracheid must therefore pass through the pit membranes, which can act as physical sieves that trap particulate contaminants present in water(Fig. 1c). Compared to most angiosperms (flowering plants), the short length of tracheids and their high proportion in the cross-section makes gymnosperm sapwood better-suited to creating compact filters.

### A critical transition in leaf evolution facilitated the cretaceous angiosperm revolution [^4bcce80d]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Leaf interior water vapour transport and photosynthesis

We investigated the hypothesized vapour-phase mechanism with an analytical model of leaf gas exchange, which coupled the diffusion pathways of CO 2 and water vapour between the atmosphere and the stomata to their respective diffusion pathways in the leaf interior. A graphical representation of our model approach is shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. We thereby considered the schematised morphologies of needle-leaved conifers and broad-leaved angiosperms (Fig. 1e) to calculate the ratio in l H 2 O(g) / l CO 2 resulting from changes in D v and D s. To reveal the subsequent consequences of changes in stomatal pore size and D s for leaf gas exchange, we solved the model for maximum photosynthetic carbon returns from equal transpirative water loss assuming that water evaporates deep inside the mesophyll near the leaf vein endings. This analysis was based on the premise that the maximum water transport capacity of the whole plant constrains the maximum transpiration rate, which in turn determines maximum photosynthesis and productivity in a specific evaporative environment. Further details on our model approach, including the assumptions and an evaluation with empirical data, are provided in the Supplementary Methods.

### Dynamics of moisture diffusion and adsorption in plant cuticles including the role of cellulose [^8355f52b]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Model validation

The model, as described in Eqs. (1)–(13) and Supplementary Eqs. (2)–(8), is solved numerically. We then validate the model solution against experimental data. We validate the model over two sets of results, one with a range of RHs, and the second with a selection of humidities and time. Figure 1 shows the results of the model (green dots), compared to the experimental data, over a range of RHs. Due to the variable nature of cuticles, we have compared the model results to three experiments on isolated tomato fruit cuticles with a similar experimental set-up (open circles),, and fitted (continuous curves) their data with a simple equation, as described in Supplementary Table 2. In Fig. 1, we can see the model compares well to all three experiments over the range of humidities. The Luque et al.data set is included as it includes high humidities, but the model is based on the Chamel et al.experimental set-up, so over all humidities the model compares well to Chamel et al. The model increases to a large degree (above a linear trend), at very high humidities, at 90%RH and 99%RH, which is the desired result. This trend at high humidities is largely the result of water attaching to the cellulose on the outside and inside cuticle surfaces, discussed later (see below).

In Fig. 2, we see the model compares well to the experimental data, at 60%RH over time, and the change in dry weight increases proportional to RH. The initial rapid increase is largely produced by cellulose and aqueous pores, with less influence from the lipophilic pathway, discussed later. In Fig. 3, we see the concentration plot of water molecules at a selection of times with the depth within the cuticle. Initially, (orange) the water concentration is low and constant through the cuticle. Then, as time increases, the concentration at the boundaries increases and then gradually diffuses into the cuticle. At late times, the cuticle is close to the concentration of pure water. We note Fig. 3 alone shows diffusing water molecules and not adsorbing molecules. Due to the asymmetric boundary conditions, the concentration of water at the two boundaries is similar but not identical.

### The structural origin of anomalous properties of liquid water [^074a6f46]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Water is the most important liquid for our existence and plays an essential role in physics, chemistry, biology and geoscience. What makes water unique is not only its importance but also the anomalous behaviour of many of its macroscopic properties. The ability to form up to four hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), in addition to the non-directional interactions seen in simple liquids, leads to many unusual properties such as increased density on melting, decreased viscosity under pressure, density maximum at 4 °C, high surface tension and many more (see, for example,). If water would not behave in this unusual way it is most questionable if life could have developed on planet Earth.

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the isobaric heat capacity (C P) and the isothermal compressibility (κ T) that initially decrease with decreasing temperature but, just above the ambient temperature regime, there is a deviation and both the heat capacity and compressibility begin to increase on further cooling, resulting in a minimum at 308 K (35 °C) and 319 K (46 °C), respectively. These properties are related to fluctuations in the liquid where κ T derives from volume, or equivalently density, fluctuations, whereas C P is related to entropy fluctuations. Similarly, the density (ρ) of a simple liquid increases with decreasing temperature and this is true also for water when it is hot. However, as it enters the ambient regime, the rate of increase decreases and a maximum in the density is seen at 277 K (4 °C) after which the density instead decreases on further cooling. The density variation can be derived from the thermal expansion coefficient (α P), dependent on the cross-correlation between fluctuations in density and entropy, which thus becomes negative for water below the density maximum. As these thermodynamic properties measure the response to external perturbations, such as temperature or pressure, they are referred to as thermodynamic response functions. Their unusual behaviour for water is denoted anomalous where the anomaly becomes much stronger on cooling. Indeed, when fitted to a power law each of these properties seems to diverge towards a temperature of 228 K (ref.).

### Engineering transverse cell deformation of bamboo by controlling localized moisture content [^2b0174cc]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

To analyze the transition from cell deformation to macroscopic deformation, we constructed an analytical model for uneven drying of delignified bamboo at a temperature difference of 50 °C, as illustrated in Fig. 2c, d. The model was divided into five regions along the thickness direction and into seven regions perpendicular to the thickness direction. The distributions of moisture and internal stress were quantified across these regions during the uneven drying process (Fig. 2e–m and Supplementary Fig. 8). The principle of uneven drying involves free water in the bamboo migrating via the large capillary system to the evaporation interface, driven by capillary tension and water vapor pressure from heating, and subsequently evaporating into the air. Supplementary Fig. 9 shows that after lignin removal, the transverse direction of the bamboo facilitates easier transfer of free water. Under the influence of heat, the bound water in bamboo was absorbed by the microcapillary system, transported, and evaporated. Consequently, driven by gradients of water content, temperature, and water vapor pressure, the bound water in bamboo continuously migrated and diffused from the bamboo interior to the evaporation interface, as both liquid and vapor. When the moisture content of the middle side (4 section) of the bamboo surface (Region I) close to the high temperature dropped below the fiber saturation point (FSP, ~30% moisture content), the bamboo began to shrink. However, because the moisture content of each inner layer was higher than the FSP, the surface layer was subject to compression due to restraint, whereas the inner layer was subjected to tension at the same time. As the drying progressed, the internal tension in bamboo gradually shifted to compression as moisture moved from regions of high to low moisture content. For instance, tension in Region II transitioned to compression after 300 min of drying (Fig. 2j), stress in Region III shifted after 450 min (Fig. 2k), and stresses in Regions IV and V adjusted after 600 min (Fig. 2l, m). This stress direction change induced the transverse deformation of the bamboo. Larger temperature differences (ΔT = 100, 150, 200, 250 °C, Supplementary Fig. 7) required less time for flattening bamboo.

### A critical transition in leaf evolution facilitated the cretaceous angiosperm revolution [^83726402]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Postvenous liquid water transport and photosynthesis

Considering the postvenous liquid-phase water transport mechanism, the maximum gas exchange capacity of a leaf is crucially constrained by its hydraulic conductance (K leaf) and the maximal leaf water potential gradient (Δ ψ leaf) before tissue damage and hydraulic failure occurs. A key determinant in K leaf is the maximum path length for postvenous water transport (l H 2 O(i)). As shown in Fig. 2a, a log-linear relation exists between l H 2 O(l) and K leaf across species. An important consequence of the evolutionary rise in angiosperm D v was therefore the reduction in l H 2 O(l) by bringing the leaf vein endings closer to the stomatal pores (Fig. 2b). The physiological advantage of the high D v in modern angiosperms is likely to be related to facilitating leaf water transport within the range of permissible Δ ψ leaf (ref.) before stomata close to protect plants from hydraulic failure. The rise in D v may therefore have provided evolving angiosperms with a means to offset a rising transpirational demand associated with higher stomatal conductance and the functioning in environments with lower atmospheric humidity, such as the upper canopy. The relation between D v and stomatal conductance under variable atmospheric humidity is illustrated in Fig. 2c using a semi-empirical model. This model assumes steady-state equilibrium between the liquid flux of water through the leaf interior up to the substomatal cavity, and the transpiration flux of water vapour through the stomata. The potential maximum photosynthetic carbon return from this water flux was calculated with the biochemical demand model of Farquhar et al.This calculation involved the assumption that stomatal conductance to water vapour (g sw) equals stomatal conductance to CO 2 (g sc) when compensated for the difference in diffusivity between water vapour and CO 2 (that is, g sw = α · g sc, with α =1.6). Although leaf venation is not the only determinant in linking leaf water transport to photosynthesis, the modelled values of g sw (Fig. 2c) imply that rising D v may have enabled evolving angiosperms to sustain photosynthesis under increasingly low atmospheric humidity and under falling C a (Fig. 2d). These results indicate that the sudden rise in angiosperm D v that occurred during the Cretaceous was related to their coeval radiation from the forest floor towards the upper canopy. However, as shown previously by Boyce and Zwienieckiusing the same semiempirical model based on the liquid-phase mechanism, there appears to be little carbon uptake advantage from increasing D v beyond ~8 mm mm −2. Other mechanisms are therefore required to explain why angiosperm leaf venation evolved so suddenly beyond 6–10 mm mm −2 during the Late Cretaceous.

### Dynamics of moisture diffusion and adsorption in plant cuticles including the role of cellulose [^7ed52e15]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Model framework

We describe a comprehensive mechanistic model for isolated cuticle water transport. The model takes the form of a nonlinear, one-dimensional diffusion model, including partial differential equations. We will briefly describe the modelling formulation that is based on the authors’ previous works,, and we refer the reader to these works for a full description of auxiliary Eqs. (5), (8) and (9) and Supplementary Eqs. (2) and (3).

Aqueous pores transport water and their properties vary between plant species, with RH, and are less influenced by temperature and the presence of waxes than the lipophilic pathway,. The sorption ability of cellulose is higher than other cuticle materials and it is not homogeneously distributed,,. We model cellulose as a separate pathway from the aqueous pores, which is reasonable due to the results shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. We account for water that can travel in three pathways: aqueous pores (A), the lipophilic pathway (L), and cellulose (C). These three pathways are governed by different mechanisms, so must be modelled separately. Moisture concentration changes primarily along the cuticle membrane depth, z (0 ≤ z ≤ b). Moisture inside the cuticle is considered liquid water, which is a reasonable assumption based on experimental data,. This model will make additions to a simple diffusion model by accommodating the unique pathways of the cuticle. We incorporate the important governing mechanisms of swelling of the aqueous pores, climatic conditions such as temperature and RH that affect the pore swelling and adsorption, parameters that account for differences in plant species, including porosity and tortuosity, pore density and radius, cuticle thickness and binding to the cuticle surface due to cellulose. The model, as described in Eqs. (1)–(13), Supplementary Eqs. (2)–(8), parameters in Table 1 and constants in Supplementary Table 3, for the diffusion and adsorption of water into the three pathways of the cuticle, is as follows:where c is the concentration of liquid water in the cuticle, ε D, ε C and ε L are the porosities, t is time, D A, D C and D L are the diffusivities, z is the depth of the cuticle, r A is the aqueous pore radius, Γ A,C is the concentration of adsorbed water in the aqueous pores and cellulose, S is the adsorption term and ρ C is the density of cellulose fibres. The subscripts A, D, C and L are aqueous pores (A is the entire aqueous pore and D is the aqueous pore available for diffusion), cellulose and lipophilic pathway. The parameters that change in space and time include c (z, t), D A (z, t), r A (z, t), ε D (z, t), Γ A,C (z, t), as described in Eqs. (5), (8), (9), (10), and (11).

### Water as the often neglected medium at the interface between materials and biology [^89d17e1f]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Central to the chemical and physical behavior of water is its nature as a polar molecule. The hydrogen and oxygen atoms have vastly different electronegativities. Thus, the oxygen atom carries a partial negative charge due to its greater attraction for the shared electrons of the H-O covalent bond. Consequently, the two hydrogen atoms carry a partial positive charge. The formation of this dipole results in electrostatic attraction between H and O atoms of adjacent water molecules, generating a type of secondary bonding called hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonds are weaker than covalent bonds. The hydrogen-oxygen bond dissociation energies are 21 and 464 kJmol −1 for hydrogen bonds and covalent bonds, respectively. Therefore, within the temperature range for which water is a liquid, hydrogen bonds are able to break and re-form in a continuous dynamic fashion. The lifespan of a hydrogen bond in liquid water is in the range of tens of femtoseconds to picoseconds. Although individual hydrogen bonds are weak, collectively they result in the high cohesive forces of water as a substance,.

The polar nature of water enables crucial cellular functions such as cell membrane formation, support of the three-dimensional shape of the DNA double helix, and it has an important role in the tertiary structure of proteins—specifically, water enables hydrophobic interactions, which are crucial to protein folding and aggregation. Water is a polar, protic solvent and amphoteric reagent, and has the ability to ionize both itself and other molecules. Due to its high heat capacity, water protects against the effects of temperature fluctuation.

There is a vast amount of literature on the behavior of water. The picture is, as yet, far from complete and research in this area is highly active. Entire journal issues have been devoted to the topic of water and its properties. Water is unique among all chemical substances in that it displays many anomalous and unexpected behavior parameters. For example, water has an unusually high boiling point for a substance composed of such small molecules; water displays a decreased viscosity when under pressure; it shows a maximum density at 4 °C and ice has a lower density than liquid water. Other thermodynamic parameters, such as specific heat (C P), thermal expansion coefficient (α P), and compressibility (k T), all show anomalous behavior. Much of the unusual behavior of water is linked to hydrogen bonding. For example, the high heat capacity and heat of vaporization are due to the large energy input required to break up the hydrogen-bonded network to allow greater molecular movement.

### Experimentally quantifying anion polarizability at the air / water interface [^956f62f8]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The adsorption of anions on hydrophobic interfaces controls important chemistry on aerosol surfaces and determines the stability of proteins, colloids and foams in a wide variety of environmental, physiological and engineered settings. Anion adsorption on the air/water interface, the paradigmatic hydrophobic surface, has been particularly well studied –. Perhaps the simplest question one can ask of this system is the following: Is anion adsorption at the air/water interface thermodynamically favourable?

In principle measurements of surface tension of the air/water interface as a function of bulk ionic strength provide such insight. Decades of such measurements have confirmed that surface tensions of aqueous salt solutions increase with increasing ionic strength, those of acids decrease, and that the magnitude of the effect depends strongly on anion and only weakly on cation,–. Historically the first observation was rationalized by Wagner, Onsager and Samaras (WOS) in their extension of the Debye–Hückel theory of bulk aqueous electrolytes to interfaces. Within this description anions are excluded from the air/water interface because exposure to a low dielectric phase leads to an enormous, unfavourable electrostatic self-energy,. While qualitatively consistent with surface tension measurements of salt solutions, this approach does not explain surface tension trends for acids or specific ion effects.

### Dynamics of moisture diffusion and adsorption in plant cuticles including the role of cellulose [^842c5acc]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Food production must increase significantly to sustain a growing global population. Reducing plant water loss may help achieve this goal and is especially relevant in a time of climate change. The plant cuticle defends leaves against drought, and so understanding water movement through the cuticle could help future proof our crops and better understand native ecology. Here, via mathematical modelling, we identify mechanistic properties of water movement in cuticles. We model water sorption in astomatous isolated cuticles, utilising three separate pathways of cellulose, aqueous pores and lipophilic. The model compares well to data both over time and humidity gradients. Sensitivity analysis shows that the grouping of parameters influencing plant species variations has the largest effect on sorption, those influencing cellulose are very influential, and aqueous pores less so but still relevant. Cellulose plays a significant role in diffusion and adsorption in the cuticle and the cuticle surfaces.

Introduction

Water-swelling is a widespread phenomenon characterized by the absorption of water molecules from the surrounding environment into the matrix of swellable materials, leading to volume expansion. This phenomenon is observed in nature, as seen in plant cells and soils exhibiting hygroscopic swelling when exposed to aqueous environments,. Additionally, it is a common occurrence in everyday technologies, such as kitchen sponges or disposable diapers,. The exploration of water-swelling phenomena has broad implications in fundamental science, and the development of functional materials. In this context, hydrogels have become exemplary artificial materials. These are cross-linked polymer networks capable of absorbing up to approximately ten times their dry weight in water while maintaining structural integrity –. Hydrogels find applications in various fields, including drug delivery,, energy harvesting, soft tissue scaffolds, sensors, soft actuators, and soft robotics. The remarkable “swelling” behaviors of hydrogels result from the hydrophilic nature of their polymeric matrix. The hydrophilicity arises from the presence of hydrophilic chemical residues, such as hydroxylic (-OH), carboxylic (-COOH), and amidic groups, serving as binding sites that attract and retain water molecules, causing an increase in polymer volume. It is important to note that the majority of reported instances of water “swelling” involve materials with inherent hydrophilicity. This raises a paradoxical question: Can water swelling be achieved using purely hydrophobic materials? Given that hydrophobic materials typically repel water and resist swelling, this question appears counterintuitive.

However, nature, with its diverse and ingenious designs, offers a compelling example in the form of Sphagnum, a plant that defies conventional expectations. In its desiccated state, Sphagnum exhibits hydrophobic characteristics due to its lignin-rich surface. However, when immersed in water, this hydrophobic material undergoes rehydration, remarkably retaining water at a rate ten times its own weight. With such excellent retention capabilities, Sphagnum is commonly utilized in horticulture to control water content in soil,. The intriguing phenomenon of the rehydration of hydrophobic Sphagnum is attributed to its inherent micron-scale porous structure, resembling a sponge with myriad tiny pores and spaces. The micron-scale porous structure can harness surface tension-induced capillary pressure to draw in water,. The surface tension, initiated by a small amount of water, cascades to attract more water, overcoming the inherent repelling forces of dried hydrophobic tissues (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1).

Fig. 2 
Validation plot compared to experimental data (Exp data in black) at 60%RH.

The 60%RH cuticle model solution (green brown) can be seen corresponding closely to the experiment in black. (v) represents the solution used for validation. The total experimental time here is 10 minutes. We reproduce the experimental data, as described around Supplementary Eq. (1).

Fig. 3 
Plant cuticle model results at a single relative humidity of 60%RH, for the concentration of diffusing water molecules over 6 h.

Over the depth of the cuticle, results are shown at a selection of times. The initial condition is shown in orange and the boundary conditions for the outside and inside cuticle surfaces are located at cuticle depth 0 and 1.87 × 10 −5 m, respectively.

We conduct a sensitivity analysis of the model, based on the validation result (v) in Fig. 2 at 60%RH, keeping all the parameters the same, then utilising the one-factor-at-a-time method to determine the model parameter sensitivities, as shown in Fig. 4. A selection of sensitivities is discussed below. Figures 1 and 2 have already displayed the sensitivity of RH and been validated with the experimental data. In Fig. 4a, we see the results of changing F s, the fractal scaling dimension, analogous to the tortuosity, of the three pathways. The increase in weight of the cuticle is very sensitive to the tortuosity of the pathways, as this modifies the diffusivities. This is the only inverse relationship produced, with increasing F s meaning a more tortuous and longer pathway that is more difficult to cross, slowing, and limiting the diffusivity and diffusion of the three pathways. When applying this result to isolated cuticle experiments, the tortuosity of aqueous pores will differ significantly between plant species cuticles, due to plant anatomy such as lamellate structures, thickness, orientation of pores and plant age,,. Therefore, the significant effect of F s indicates that the variation of plant species itself has a significant effect on water transport, and this is seen experimentally.
