## Question

How often to check viral load for a patient that completed hepatitis c therapy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often to check hepatitis C viral load after completing therapy and how to structure post-treatment follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the timing of the test-of-cure (SVR12). Then, I should verify what to do if SVR12 is undetectable versus detectable. Next, I will consider liver disease stage and whether the patient has cirrhosis, because that changes surveillance. After that, I need to assess ongoing risk of reinfection and how that modifies RNA testing frequency. Finally, I should confirm what not to do, including avoiding HCV antibody testing after cure and clarifying when resistance testing is indicated.

> Let me first confirm the timing of the test-of-cure. The standard of care is to obtain a quantitative HCV RNA 12 or more weeks after completing direct-acting antiviral therapy to document sustained virologic response; undetectable HCV RNA at this timepoint equals virologic cure, and SVR12 has supplanted SVR24 as the primary endpoint in the DAA era, so I should anchor SVR assessment at 12 weeks post-treatment [^117WERaX] [^114UCUfw] [^114jJF26].

> Wait, let me verify the assay performance implications for SVR12. Most treatment failures have relatively high viral loads at SVR12, and a lower limit of detection around 227 IU/mL would capture 95% of failures, which supports using standard sensitive PCR assays for SVR12. Very low-level viremia at SVR12 is uncommon, so routine ultra-sensitive testing is not required for test-of-cure in typical settings [^1129JxPg] [^116XAzbM].

> If SVR12 is undetectable, I should confirm next steps by fibrosis stage. For patients without cirrhosis, no liver-specific follow-up is needed after SVR12; they can be discharged from HCV care and managed like persons never infected, though I should still address general liver health counseling and comorbidities [^113aXsRo] [^112jb7ab]. For patients with cirrhosis, I need to ensure indefinite hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance with liver ultrasound every 6 months, with or without AFP, because SVR reduces but does not eliminate HCC risk; I should not intensify HCC surveillance solely due to recent DAA therapy in the absence of other indications [^114UCUfw] [^1116tbsB] [^112R13dC].

> Hold on, I should verify reinfection risk and how it changes RNA testing. For persons with ongoing risk factors such as injection drug use, high-risk sexual exposures, incarceration, or ongoing hemodialysis, annual HCV RNA testing is recommended, and testing should also be triggered anytime aminotransferases rise unexpectedly; importantly, I should use HCV RNA rather than HCV antibody to detect recurrence because antibodies persist after cure [^114UCUfw] [^115FZWKA] [^113szxvg]. Let me reconsider the frequency: if risk is high or intermittent, more frequent testing may be reasonable, but the guideline minimum is annual for those with ongoing risk [^114UCUfw].

> If SVR12 is detectable, I need to check whether this represents relapse or reinfection. I should confirm the result with repeat HCV RNA testing and, if feasible, assess for new risk exposures. Management should be coordinated with a clinician experienced in HCV treatment failure, and if retreatment is delayed or not feasible, I should monitor liver disease progression every 6–12 months with hepatic function panel, CBC, and INR while planning retreatment [^114UCUfw] [^117Tx6ik] [^114RZyBx].

> But wait, what if the patient is on immunosuppression after SVR? I initially thought routine RNA monitoring might be warranted in all immunosuppressed patients, but let me verify the guidance. The AASLD/IDSA guidance does not recommend routine prospective monitoring for HCV recurrence solely due to immunosuppression after SVR; instead, I should individualize based on clinical context and test if there is unexplained hepatic dysfunction or other clinical suspicion, recognizing that definitive data on reactivation risk post-SVR under immunosuppression are limited and most patients with SVR are cured [^112XBsg9] [^111oqPPY].

> I should double-check what not to do after cure. Repeating HCV antibody testing is not useful because antibodies remain positive for life; instead, if recurrence is suspected, I must use HCV RNA. Also, resistance-associated substitution testing is not recommended during or after therapy unless retreatment is planned, in which case it should be obtained in advance to guide regimen selection [^117Dx7m3] [^111S8Uz4].

> Next, I should review special populations and simplified care pathways. In treatment-naive adults without cirrhosis, minimal monitoring approaches with SVR confirmation at 12 weeks post-treatment are acceptable and have shown high SVR rates in trials. This supports streamlined follow-up when appropriate safeguards are in place, while still ensuring SVR12 documentation [^113dffih] [^112eTEna]. For persons with HIV/HCV coinfection, the same principles apply: document SVR12 and perform annual RNA testing if ongoing risk exists, with HCC surveillance continued indefinitely for those with cirrhosis [^113xXbrV].

> Putting this together, my final algorithm is as follows: obtain SVR12 at 12 or more weeks after therapy completion for all patients. If undetectable and there is no cirrhosis, discharge from HCV care with risk-reduction counseling. If undetectable and cirrhosis is present, continue indefinite 6-month HCC surveillance. If there are ongoing risk factors for reinfection, arrange annual HCV RNA testing and test promptly if aminotransferases rise. If SVR12 is detectable, confirm, distinguish relapse from reinfection, involve an HCV-experienced clinician, and if retreatment is delayed, monitor liver disease progression every 6–12 months [^117WERaX] [^114UCUfw] [^113aXsRo].

---

After completing hepatitis C therapy, **check the viral load once at 12 weeks** [^117WERaX] to confirm sustained virologic response (SVR) [^114UCUfw]. If SVR is achieved, **no further routine viral load testing is needed** [^112jb7ab]; if ongoing risk exists, test annually or if ALT rises [^114UCUfw]. If SVR is not achieved, **repeat viral load every 3–6 months** until retreatment and monitor for disease progression [^114RZyBx].

---

## Recommended timing for post-treatment viral load testing

The standard of care is to **confirm SVR at 12 weeks** [^117WERaX] after therapy completion using a sensitive HCV RNA assay [^116u22g2]. Undetectable HCV RNA at this timepoint constitutes virologic cure [^114UCUfw].

---

## Frequency of viral load monitoring after achieving SVR

After SVR, **routine viral load monitoring is not required** [^113szxvg]; patients without cirrhosis can be discharged from HCV-specific follow-up [^111dS1iR]. For those with ongoing risk (e.g. injection drug use, high-risk sexual exposure, hemodialysis), **annual HCV RNA testing** [^114UCUfw] is recommended, or sooner if ALT rises [^114UCUfw].

---

## Frequency of viral load monitoring if SVR is not achieved

If SVR is not achieved, **repeat HCV RNA every 3–6 months** to monitor disease progression and guide retreatment timing [^notfound]. Continue surveillance until SVR is achieved or retreatment is initiated.

---

## Clinical implications of viral load results

- **Undetectable viral load at 12 weeks (SVR12)**: Indicates virologic cure; no further routine viral load testing is needed [^114UCUfw] [^111F56yg].
- **Detectable viral load at 12 weeks**: Indicates treatment failure or relapse; evaluate for retreatment and monitor disease progression [^112zHVuH] [^114RZyBx].

---

## Factors influencing frequency of viral load monitoring

Several factors influence the **frequency of post-treatment viral load monitoring**:

| **Factor** | **Recommended frequency** |
|-|-|
| Cirrhosis | - HCC surveillance every 6 months [^114UCUfw] <br/> - Annual viral load if ongoing risk [^114UCUfw] |
| Ongoing risk factors (e.g. injection drug use, high-risk sexual exposure, hemodialysis) | Annual viral load testing or if ALT rises [^114UCUfw] [^113xXbrV] |
| Immunosuppression | More frequent monitoring (individualized) [^11436DQb] |
| Treatment failure | Every 3–6 months until SVR or retreatment [^notfound] |

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current AASLD/IDSA guidance recommends **SVR confirmation at 12 weeks** [^117WERaX] and no routine viral load monitoring after SVR unless risk factors exist [^111dS1iR]. Annual testing is advised for ongoing risk or if ALT rises [^114UCUfw].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **Routine viral load monitoring**: Once at 12 weeks post-treatment to confirm SVR [^117WERaX] [^114UCUfw].
- **After SVR**: No routine viral load monitoring unless ongoing risk factors exist [^113aXsRo].
- **Ongoing risk factors**: Annual viral load testing or if ALT rises [^114UCUfw] [^113xXbrV].
- **Treatment failure**: Monitor every 3–6 months until SVR or retreatment [^notfound].

These recommendations balance the high efficacy of DAAs, the durability of SVR, and the need to detect reinfection or relapse in at-risk patients.

### Sustained virological response after early discontinuation of hepatitis C treatment [^1173eyiU]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2024). Medium credibility.

To date, the effectiveness of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) discontinued before 4weeks has not been analysed in routine clinical practice. The study aimed to determine whether such a short therapy will enable achieving a sustained virological response under real-world experience. The study population of 97 patients who discontinued DAA therapy and had data enabling analysis of patient and disease characteristics, and assessment of treatment effectiveness was selected from 16,815 patients registered in the EpiTer-2 database. The most common reason for discontinuation was hepatic decompensation (20.6%) or the patient's personal decision (18.6%). Patients who discontinued treatment were significantly older, more frequently therapy-experienced, more likely to have cirrhosis, a history of decompensation and a Child-Pugh B or C classification than those who completed treatment. SVR was achieved by 93.5% of patients who discontinued treatment after 4weeks, 60.9% if discontinued at 3 or 4week and 33.3% at Week 1 or 2. Patients receiving pangenotypic but not genotype-specific treatment who discontinued after 4weeks were as likely to achieve SVR as those who completed therapy. Patients who responded to treatment that lasted no longer than 2weeks had a low baseline viral load (< 400,000IU/mL). Despite discontinuation of therapy after Week 4, the chances of SVR are high. Very early discontinuation does not preclude therapeutic success, especially in patients with low baseline viral load.

Effort should be made to document SVR (HCV RNA less than lower limits of quantification) at least 12 weeks after completion of therapy (AI); patients without cirrhosis who achieve SVR do not require continued liver disease monitoring. Periodic assessment for HCV reinfection should be done via HCV RNA testing on an at least yearly basis for those with ongoing risk behaviors or more frequently as dictated by clinical circumstances (AII). In the setting of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma screening with liver ultrasound every 6 months should continue indefinitely (BII).

Introduction

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major global public health problem and cause of liver disease, with the highest burden in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). In 2019, there were an estimated 290 000 HCV-related deaths. In 2016, WHO launched the Global Health Sector Strategy for Viral Hepatitis 2016–2021, with a goal of eliminating viral hepatitis B and hepatitis C by 2030. Good progress has been made, with an estimated 9.4 million people with chronic HCV infection treated using direct-acting antiviral therapy between 2015 and 2019. However, as of 2019, there were still 58 million people with chronic HCV infection, and only 20% of those infected worldwide had been diagnosed and 13% treated. To address this gap and achieve the WHO targets for elimination will require a substantial scale-up of testing and treatment using simplified service delivery models. A 2021 WHO-led systematic review provided a strong evidence base for the effectiveness of full decentralisation of testing and treatment and integration with other services at harm-reduction sites, supported through task sharing, especially among people who inject drugs.

The recommended diagnostic strategy for chronic HCV infection is initial screening with an HCV antibody serological assay, followed by laboratory-based molecular viral load testing for HCV RNA, to confirm the presence of HCV viraemia and need for treatment. However, access to laboratory-based viral load testing remains limited in many LMICs. As a result, many people with chronic HCV infection are never linked to care. HCV viral load assays performed on point-of-care (POC) devices outside the laboratory are being increasingly used as an alternative testing approach, especially in facilities caring for populations with high rates of loss to care and follow‑up.POC devices can also be used for a test of cure after completing treatment, in addition to same-day diagnosis of HCV viraemic infection.

Although there is now high-quality evidence of the clinical impact of POC assays for HIV viral load monitoring, early infant diagnosis of HIV, and diagnosis of tuberculosis, data on their impact on promoting access to HCV viral load testing and treatment are scarce. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of using POC HCV viral load assays compared with centralised, high-throughput, laboratory-based standard-of-care (SOC) approaches on uptake of HCV viral load testing and treatment, and turnaround times to treatment initiation in HCV-antibody seropositive people.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^111dS1iR]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

AASLD–IDSA simplified HCV treatment — on‑treatment and post‑treatment monitoring for treatment‑naive adults without cirrhosis advises to inform patients taking diabetes medication of the potential for symptomatic hypoglycemia with monitoring for hypoglycemia recommended, and to inform patients taking warfarin of potential anticoagulation changes with monitoring INR for subtherapeutic anticoagulation recommended; no laboratory monitoring is required for other patients. Post‑treatment, assessment of quantitative HCV RNA and a hepatic function panel are recommended 12 weeks or later following completion of therapy to confirm undetectable HCV RNA and transaminase normalization. After achieving cure, no liver‑related follow‑up is recommended for noncirrhotic patients; those with ongoing risk should be tested for HCV RNA annually and whenever they develop elevated ALT, AST, or bilirubin. If initial treatment fails, patients should be evaluated for retreatment, and for those unable to be retreated, assessment for disease progression every 6 to 12 months with a hepatic function panel, CBC, and INR is recommended.

### Loss to follow-up of patients after antiviral treatment as an additional barrier to HCV elimination [^116JzcLh]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Information relating to HCV infection reported in the database included genotype and viral load, history of prior therapy, and type of current DAA regimen. Viraemia HCV (ribonucleic acid, RNA) was assessed at baseline, at the end of therapy, and after treatment by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction with a lower limit of detection not higher than 15 IU/mL following national recommendations.

Patients were treated with genotype-specific or pangenotypic DAA options. Genotype-specific regimens include following combinations: asunaprevir (ASV) + daclatasvir (DCV), ledipasvir (LDV) and sofosbuvir (SOF) ± ribavirin (RBV), ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir+dasabuvir (OBV/PTV/r+DSV) ± RBV, grazoprevir (GZR) and elbasvir (EBR) ± RBV, and SOF with simeprevir (SMV) used with or without RBV. The pangenotypic options comprised the combination of SOF and RBV, SOF with DCV ± RBV, SOF and velpatasvir (VEL), SOF/VEL with voxilaprevir (VOX), glecaprevir (GLE) and pibrentasvir (PIB), and GLE/PIB plus SOF and RBV.

The measure of treatment effectiveness was sustained virologic response (SVR), defined as undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after completion of therapy. Patients with a detectable viral load at this time point were considered virologic nonresponders, while those without this assessment were defined as lost to follow-up (LTFU). Data regarding the status of the patient — living or deceased — who did not attend the SVR appointment was checked in the system of insured persons. For the purpose of this analysis, the patients were divided into two groups: with SVR assessment and without SVR assessment, after excluding cases of deaths.

During therapy and up to 12 weeks after its completion, data were collected on the course of treatment, the incidence of adverse events (AEs) with an assessment of their severity, and deaths.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The curing of HCV infection is associated with reduced liver-related morbidity and mortality and an improved quality of life. Following the introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), HCV infection can now be cured in the majority of patients.

Treatment efficacy is determined by measuring HCV RNA at specific time points before, during, and after antiviral therapy. According to current guidelines, real-time PCR-based HCV RNA assays must be highly sensitive and accurate, with a broad linear range of quantification across all HCV genotypes.

Baseline viral load is known to be an important predictor of treatment efficacy in patients treated with interferon (IFN)-based regimens. A low baseline HCV RNA, along with other factors, has also been used to identify patients eligible for a shortened course of IFN-based therapy. Moreover, on-treatment HCV RNA measurements were used to guide treatment duration and decisions on futility, particularly in patients treated with the protease inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir. Even with today's widely used IFN-free ledipasvir/sofosbuvir regimen, baseline HCV RNA is used for determining treatment duration, whereas subsequent HCV RNA measurements are mainly used for assessing the patient's adherence and for demonstrating viral eradication after treatment completion. In addition, on-treatment HCV RNA measurements may still be used for predicting the efficacy of IFN-free DAA regimens in some patient subgroups, including in patients with cirrhosis and those with HCV genotype (GT) 3 infections. For this purpose, current guidelines recommend measuring HCV RNA at different time points, ideally with the same assay to maintain consistency of results.

### Determining the lower limit of detection required for HCV viral load assay for test of cure following direct-acting antiviral-based treatment regimens: evidence from a global data set [^1155icSB]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

The primary strength of this study is that the analysis was based on the largest global data set to date of nearly 6000 of HCV treatment failures. The high cure rate associated with pan‐genotypic DAAs, routinely exceeding 90%, has previously made it difficult to assemble a large enough cohort, representing different geographic regions with different genotypes, range of stage of disease and use of different DAA regimens with adequate rates of follow‐up SVR measurement — to reflect real‐life distribution of viral loads at treatment failure. We had data from both clinical trials with high level of follow‐up, as well as from observational cohorts reflecting real‐world treatment experience.

There are several limitations to the data and analysis. First, we are not able to measure all potential factors contributing to HCV RNA level at treatment failure, such as risk characteristics (injection drug behaviours, sex work, etc.), but the initial analysis did not show that drug regimen, genotype or stage of disease were important determinants of low‐level treatment failure. It is important to study and understand those unmeasured confounders, because if the underlying causal relationship is between a measurable or identifiable trait and the likelihood of having LLV at the time of treatment failure, then it may be possible to tailor guidance to identify venues or subgroups of people in whom it is still appropriate to employ available, close to patient assays to test for HCV cure. Second, our data set only included those who initiated treatment and returned for follow‐up HCV RNA testing 12 weeks post‐treatment. It is likely that those who fail to return for SVR may be at higher risk of treatment failure, and it is unclear whether they will be at lower or higher risk for LLV. However, this primarily affects the observational cohort and not clinical trial registry data. Third, more than 70% of our global data set cohort of treatment failures came from either Egypt (predominantly genotype 4) or the United States (predominantly genotype 1). We were not able to assemble a cohort of individuals with HCV treatment failure that represented all HCV genotypes, and all stages of disease. Finally, our global data set included data from both national and health system‐wide observational databases reflecting real‐world treatment experience, as well as from clinical trials with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Minimal monitoring (MINMON) during direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy — international phase 4, open-label, single-arm trial in treatment-naive adults with active HCV infection — enrolled 400 participants aged ≥ 18 years from 38 sites in Brazil, South Africa, Thailand, Uganda, and the United States, including persons with compensated cirrhosis and HIV coinfection; exclusions were pregnancy, breastfeeding, and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (HBsAg positive), while those with resolved HBV (anti-HBc positive, with or without anti-HBs) were eligible. Of the 400 enrolled, 399 initiated a planned 12-week once-daily sofosbuvir (400 mg)/velpatasvir (100 mg) course, and minimal monitoring comprised four elements: no pretreatment genotyping, dispensing the entire course at entry, no scheduled on-treatment visits or laboratory monitoring, and remote contacts at week 4 to assess DAA adherence and at week 22 to schedule SVR assessment at week 24. At entry, 42% (166) were living with HIV, 9% (34) had compensated cirrhosis, and 32% (121 of 374) with an available HBV panel had resolved HBV infection; SVR was achieved by 95% (379 of 399) of those who initiated treatment, and fourteen participants experienced a serious adverse event between initiation and week 28, with none treatment-related or leading to treatment discontinuation or death.

4 DISCUSSION

The analysis of a data set of 5973 cases of detectable viraemia following treatment with a wide range of different DAA treatment regimens from nine different country observational cohorts and two international clinical trials databases shows that 95% of HCV treatment failures identified 12 weeks after the end of DAA therapy have a VL greater than 227 IU/mL (2.36 log IU/mL) and 97% have greater than 70 IU/mL (95% CI 48–86). There were important differences in the distribution of viral load at treatment failure in those who were participants in clinical trials compared to observational studies. The median viral load at treatment failure was nearly 10‐fold higher (2,344,229 IU/mL in clinical trial registries vs. 264,809 IU/mL in observational cohorts) and 95% had a viral load greater than 4030 IU/mL (95% CI 24–4100) compared to 214 IU/mL (95% CI 166–266). Just 3% of clinical trial participants had viral load under 1000 IU/mL, compared to 10% in those from observational databases. This is broadly consistent with results from an analysis of 34 phase 2/3 clinical trials which showed less than 1% had had viral load under 1000 IU/mL. The reasons for this higher viral load in treatment failures among trial participants may relate to the more stringent selection criteria for clinical trials and exclusion of those with LLV (only those with VL > 1000 IU/ml were enrolled, and on‐treatment failures were excluded from analysis). This highlights importance of reporting analyses separately for clinical trial and observational databases.

### Monitoring of viral levels during therapy of hepatitis C [^116fjRA7]. Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Alpha interferon therapy of chronic hepatitis C is typically accompanied by a biphasic decrease in hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA levels: an initial rapid decline during the first 24 to 48 hours, and a second more gradual decline during the following weeks. The rate of second-phase decline correlates with ultimate response to interferon treatment. Thus, assessment of early virological response (EVR) may predict outcome. Data from 2 large clinical trials of peginterferon and ribavirin were combined and analyzed to determine the optimal definition of an EVR which, if not achieved, was associated with a low likelihood of a sustained virological response (SVR). A fall in HCV RNA level to undetectable or by at least 2 log(10) units after 12 weeks was found to be the optimal definition of an EVR. Among 965 patients, 778 (80%) achieved an EVR by week 12, including all except 1 patient with genotypes 2 or 3. Among 187 patients without an EVR, only 3 (1.6%) had an SVR. These findings suggest that patients with genotype 1 who do not achieve an EVR should stop treatment after 12 weeks. Use of an early stopping rule reduces treatment costs by at least 16% and avoids the inconvenience and side effects of treatment in the 19% of patients without an EVR who have little chance of a lasting virological response.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^112fLM8J]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Initial HCV testing and follow-up — For initial screening, HCV-antibody testing with reflex HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction testing is recommended (I, A), and HCV-antibody testing using a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved assay (laboratory-based or point-of-care) is recommended. Among persons with a negative HCV-antibody test who were exposed to HCV within the prior 6 months, HCV-RNA or follow-up HCV-antibody testing 6 months or longer after exposure is recommended; HCV-RNA testing can also be considered for immunocompromised persons (I, C). Among persons at risk for reinfection after previous spontaneous or treatment-related viral clearance, HCV-RNA testing is recommended because a positive HCV-antibody test is expected (I, C). Persons with a positive HCV-antibody test and negative results for HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction should be informed that they do not have evidence of current (active) HCV infection but are not protected from reinfection (I, A). Quantitative HCV-RNA testing is recommended prior to initiation of antiviral therapy to document the baseline level of viremia (i.e., baseline viral load) (I, A). HCV genotype testing may be considered for those in whom it may alter treatment recommendations (I, A).

Issues Under Consideration

Principal considerations for treatment of CHC include dose and duration of antiviral therapy (along with related costs), quantification of baseline HCV RNA levels, the definition of response during the early stages and at the end of treatment, as well as the duration of the post-treatment follow-up period. In addition, there remain a number of areas of uncertainty that have also to be taken into consideration, such as the variation in baseline viral load, monitoring time points and the 'time window' within which monitoring needs to take place.

Current treatment algorithm for treatment of patients with HCV

Current treatment recommendations for patients chronically infected with HCV are shown in Fig. 1. Briefly, patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection are more responsive to the current standard of care of peginterferon plus RBV than those with genotype 1 or genotype 4 infection. The rates of SVR for genotype 2 or 3 infection are similar in patients treated for 24 or 48 weeks; thus, for these patients 24-week treatment is generally considered appropriate. For patients infected with HCV genotype 1, the recommended treatment duration is 48 weeks of peginterferon with RBV. While standard doses for peginterferon alfa-2a (180 μg, qw) and peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 μg/kg, qw) are well established, different recommendations exist for RBV dose according to HCV genotype and type of peginterferon. It appears that lower doses of RBV are required for treatment of patients infected with HCV genotype 2 or 3 than for genotypes 1 or 4. For the standard duration of treatment of HCV genotype 1 and 4 infection, weight-based RBV doses of 800–1200 mg, qd, or up to 1400 mg for patients above 105 kg, are recommended, while no additional benefit of RBV doses higher than 800 mg in HCV genotype 2 and 3 infection was observed in several studies. Available data for patients infected with genotype 5 or 6 are limited; therefore, combination treatment with 1000/1200 mg, qd, RBV for 48 weeks is currently recommended.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^114UCUfw]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

AASLD–IDSA Hepatitis C guidance — post-treatment assessment, surveillance, and retreatment: After direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, HCV-RNA and aminotransferase testing are recommended 12 or more weeks after completion to assess treatment response, and undetectable HCV RNA represents sustained virologic response (SVR) and virologic cure. For cirrhosis, ultrasound surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma every 6 months after treatment completion is recommended regardless of achieving SVR. For persons with ongoing HCV risk factors, HCV-RNA testing annually or anytime an increase in hepatic aminotransferase levels occurs is also recommended. Recurrent HCV viremia after attainment of SVR represents either reinfection or a relapse; with reinfection, the treatment approaches are identical to those for initial treatment. If relapse is suspected or cannot be ruled out, such patients should be managed by clinicians with expertise in managing HCV treatment failure, and if retreatment is delayed or not feasible, assessment for liver disease progression every 6–12 months is recommended.

### Very low hepatitis C viral loads in treatment-naive persons: Do they compromise hepatitis C virus antigen testing? [^114xvYAH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antigen testing is less expensive than quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction but has lower sensitivity for very low viral load (VLVL; HCV RNA ≤ 3000 IU/mL). Currently the benefits of antigen testing for screening are discussed, but data on prevalence and outcomes of persons with VLVL are scarce.

Methods

We assessed prevalence and predictors of VLVL by logistic regression in treatment-naive participants in the Swiss Hepatitis C Cohort Study. We analyzed if the last viral load after VLVL was low, compared cirrhosis and mortality in persons with and without VLVL, and evaluated the number of samples with VLVL that were reactive by antigen testing.

Results

We included 2533 treatment-naive persons with available quantitative HCV RNA testing results. Overall, 133 persons (5.3%) had a VLVL. Age 18–40 years, female sex, and human immunodeficiency virus coinfection were associated with VLVL. Of 72 persons with a viral load available after VLVL, 14% had a VLVL and 17% had spontaneous viral clearance. The prevalence and incidence of cirrhosis and mortality were comparable in persons with and without VLVL; all 24 persons with VLVL and cirrhosis had excessive alcohol consumption or immunosuppression. Overall, 33% of samples with VLVL were reactive by antigen testing.

Conclusions

The frequency of VLVL was low. Among the persons who would probably be missed by antigen screening, some had a favorable disease course, but some had immunosuppression and liver cirrhosis. The benefit of HCV antigen testing for screening may be limited by the risk of missing patients with severe liver disease.

3.4.1 Clinical trial and observational cohorts

We found a higher distribution of detectable viral loads from the two clinical trial registries. The median viral load was 2,344,229 (IQR = 5,911,542 IU/mL with 25th percentile = 545,000 and 75% percentile = 6,456,542), and 90% of those with detectable viraemia at SVR12 had a viral load greater than 98,420 (95% CI 17,600–199,962), 95% greater than 4030 IU/mL (95% CI 24–4100), 97% greater than 923 IU/mL (95% CI 24–4030) and 99% greater than 24 IU/mL (95% CI 14–24), respectively (Table 4). The distribution of viral load from non‐pharmaceutical trials (observational databases) had median viral load of 264,809 (IQR = 1,196,500 IU/mL with 25th percentile = 23,500 and 75% percentile = 1,220,000), and 90% of those with detectable viraemia at SVR12 had a viral load greater than 1062 (95% CI 816–1300), 95% greater than 214 IU/mL (95% CI 166–266), 97% greater than 69 IU/mL (95% CI 48–85) and 99% greater than 19 (95% CI 16–22) (Table 4).

Genotype 1

Week 12 stopping rule for patients with HCV genotype 1

The current week 12 stopping rule recommends that patients without a ≥ 2 log 10 drop in viral load compared to baseline (between 19% and 29% of patients with genotype 1 infection) discontinue therapy since the likelihood of achieving SVR with continued treatment is small; the negative predictive value is almost 100%. Over-treatment of patients who have an extremely low chance of achieving SVR is thus avoided and valuable resources can be reserved for patients with a higher chance of treatment success. Week 12 monitoring should be carried out as close as possible to the week 12 time point, ideally ± 5 days, using a test with high sensitivity and wide dynamic range. Whether the 2 log 10 drop represents the most accurate cut-off level for the decision on treatment termination or proceeding remains to be determined in prospective clinical studies. It is likely that with greater use of more sensitive assays with a broader range of linear quantification (e.g. real-time PCR assays), this parameter may be refined/adjusted in the near future. It may also be the case that new drugs currently in development will require different threshold levels and/or stopping rules based on their different modes of action, although this remains to be seen.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in healthcare personnel with suppressed but detectable viremia — risk context and monitoring are outlined: each case should be assessed individually by an oversight panel; the Australian guidelines and the UK guidelines set this threshold at 200 copies/ mL; transmission has never been documented from a source HCP whose viral load was < 1,000 copies/mL, with one instance reported at 1,500 copies/mL where the sample was obtained > 7 months after the transmission event; elite controllers have infrequent fluctuations with detectable viremia generally < 50 copies/mL and results should always be validated by a second viral load test; low-level fluctuations occur in 10%–23% of persons with sustained suppression and likely do not present a risk for HCP-to-patient transmission; for higher viral loads > 500 copies/mL, repeat viral load testing in 1–2 weeks is recommended.

### Performance of the new aptima HCV quant Dx assay in comparison to the cobas taqMan HCV2 test for use with the high pure system in detection and quantification of hepatitis C virus RNA in plasma or serum [^116u22g2]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

The gold standard for monitoring SVR in HCV-infected patients under treatment is to quantitate HCV RNA in the patient's plasma or serum at regular intervals during and after therapy. Depending on the regimen and the inclusion of IFN, this can include measurement at baseline, week 2 (IFN free), week 4, week 12, week 24, and week 48 (nonresponders for certain regimens) of treatment and 12 or 24 weeks after the end of therapy. Not only is HCV RNA monitoring important for determining the initial viral load, it is necessary to assess patient adherence and for following stopping rules to determine when treatment is ineffective and should be discontinued. This is a necessity for managing side effect profiles, minimizing the emergence of viral resistance, and decreasing the cost of therapy. European guidelines recommend stopping treatment with the triple combination pIFN plus ribavirin plus simeprevir if HCV RNA levels are ≥ 25 IU/ml at week 4, 12, or 24; no futility rules have been defined for other treatment regimens. United States guidelines, however, do not provide specific recommendations regarding when to stop or extend therapy except to discontinue treatment if HCV RNA is detectable at week 4 and increases by > 10-fold on repeat testing at week 6 (or thereafter). Because these rules are based on a threshold of quantitation of HCV RNA of 25 IU/ml, the guidelines recommend that monitoring be performed using a sensitive real-time quantitative HCV RNA assay, i.e. an assay with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for HCV RNA of ≤ 25 IU/ml and a limit of detection (LOD) of ≤ 15 IU/ml.

Recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after SVR — signals and current guidance: In one report, 9 of 285 patients (3%) without a history of HCC were diagnosed with a de novo tumor within 24 weeks after direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, whereas 17 of 59 patients (29%) with prior HCC developed recurrent HCC; a second study reported 16 of 58 patients (28%) with recurrent HCC shortly after DAA therapy, while analyses of 3 separate ANRS cohorts found no evidence of a significant increase in HCC incidence. Despite these signals, at present there is insufficient evidence to warrant a change in surveillance strategy for such patients, nor is there sufficient evidence to suggest that DAA therapy should be withheld after prior locoregional therapy; some clinicians might choose to consider intensification of imaging frequency to every 3 months for a year after completion of HCV treatment.

### Determining the lower limit of detection required for HCV viral load assay for test of cure following direct-acting antiviral-based treatment regimens: evidence from a global data set [^1129JxPg]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

This study assessed the distribution of detectable viral loads 12 weeks following the end of treatment for HCV infection in an international cohort to inform the lower limit of detection of viral load assays for test of cure to identify treatment failure as well as for diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C infection. Based on a combined data set of clinical trials and observational data, a LLoD of 227 IU/mL (4030 IU/mL in the clinical trials subsample) would identify 95% of patients with a detectable viral load 12 weeks after treatment. While more than 10 times higher than the analytical sensitivity of laboratory‐based NAATs, it is more than 10 times lower than the LLoD for HCV diagnosis. These findings demonstrate it might be prudent and necessary to consider different LLoD standards for HCV diagnosis and for test of cure. Development of a point‐of‐care HCV test for cure with a low enough limit of detection to identify 95% of patients and is affordable, is an important aspect of expanding access to HCV treatment and a vital component of the WHO's HCV elimination targets.

### Management of healthcare personnel living with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus in US healthcare institutions [^112T8dB1]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Management of HCP living with HCV — HCP living with HCV should seek an initial evaluation from a physician who has expertise in HCV management to characterize the serologic and virologic aspects of infection and should seek optimal medical management, including treatment with effective antiviral agents to achieve cure of the infection. HCP living with HCV who do not perform category III/exposure-prone procedures should not be prohibited from participating in patient-care activities solely on the basis of their HCV infection, and consonant with the most recent set of guidelines from CDC concerning the management of HCP living with HBV, there is no justification for, nor benefit gained from, routine notification of patients of HCP living with HCV, who are being managed by the institution's oversight panel. For those who perform category III/exposure-prone procedures, HCP living with HCV who, despite appropriate antiviral treatment, continue to have detectable circulating HCV RNA ≥ 2,000 IU/mL should not perform category III/exposure-prone procedures, while HCP living with HCV who received treatment resulting in 'undetectable' circulating HCV-RNA levels can perform category III/exposure-prone procedures, as long as the individual has not been previously identified as having transmitted infection to patients following definitive therapy resulting in an SVR and provides the oversight panel with records and laboratory results confirming receipt of definitive therapy resulting in sustained virologic response (SVR), with a check for SVR at 12 weeks following the completion of therapy.

### Tools needed to support same-day diagnosis and treatment of current hepatitis C virus infection [^113HzcvE]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Current hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevention efforts and treatment rates must improve for the United States to achieve World Health Organization global elimination targets by 2030. Within the current multiday diagnosis and treatment paradigm for HCV infection, there is a substantial loss in the cascade of care, resulting in far fewer patients receiving treatment with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) than those with HCV infection diagnosed at initial testing. These losses are further compounded by the limited number of primary healthcare providers available to treat HCV, the difficult referral system providers have to navigate to direct patients with newly diagnosed HCV infection into care, and the lengthy time needed to procure DAAs through prior authorization requirements.

The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidance recommends treatment for all patients with acute or chronic HCV infection, except those with short life expectancies that cannot be remediated by HCV therapy, liver transplantation, or another directed therapy, with a goal of reducing the all-cause mortality rate and liver-related health adverse consequences through virologic cure achieved by sustained virologic response (SVR) 12 weeks after treatment discontinuation. Selection and initiation of a DAA regimen can often be delayed by the time required to complete pretreatment assessments.

### Determining the lower limit of detection required for HCV viral load assay for test of cure following direct-acting antiviral-based treatment regimens: evidence from a global data set [^117BfuDX]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

Currently, the European Association for the Study of the Liver Diseases, IDSA‐AASLD HCV guidance panel, all recommend a minimum LLoD of 1000 IU/mL for HCV diagnosis, but none yet specify minimal test characteristics for test of cure. While some small studies have examined the distribution of viral load at end of treatment — including a cohort of eight patients from the United States, a cohort of 14 patients in Germanyand 330 treatment failures in an analysis of 34 phase 2/3 clinical trials. The latter study in clinical trials identify that 97% had a viral load > 10,000 IU/mL 12 weeks post‐treatment, and just 0.9% of patients had a viral load less than 1000 IU/mL (77, 405 and 680 IU/mL). To date, there have been no real world, global analyses of distribution of viral load in those with detectable viraemia at SVR12.

Our primary objective was to determine the LLoD for an HCV RNA assay to detect 90%, 95%, 97% and 99% of treatment failures at 12 weeks post‐treatment in a large multi‐cohort data set, and to assess the characteristics associated with low‐level viraemia (< 1000 IU/mL) at SVR12. These findings will help inform global policy as well as guide manufacturers as to whether existing platforms and assays meet requirements for their use both in diagnosis and as a test of cure, and for future development of testing technologies.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of progressive liver disease and associated morbidity and mortality globally. In 2021, there were an estimated 58 million persons with a chronic infection, with a disproportionately high burden in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Short‐course curative direct‐acting antiviral (DAA) regimens have transformed opportunities for treatment scale‐up and elimination. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Global Health Sector Strategy for elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat, with ambitious targets for elimination of HCV including a 90% reduction in new infections and a 65% reduction in HCV‐related mortality by 2030.

In order to meet the 2030 global targets for HCV elimination, there is a need to substantially scale‐up access to testing and treatment, with simplified service delivery models and diagnostic innovations to expand access. A key step in the care cascade is the use of HCV viral load assays to confirm presence of viraemic infection, and then a test of cure following treatment. The 2017 WHO viral hepatitis testing guidelines recommended a laboratory‐based PCR Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing (NAAT), or a core HCV antigen assay with comparable clinical sensitivity, as preferred strategies for diagnosis of viraemic HCV infection, and laboratory‐based PCR assays as a test of cure at SVR12. Point‐of‐care HCV viral load assays are now available as an alternative to laboratory‐based NAAT assays to promote access, especially in hard to reach or marginalized populations. A previous multi‐cohort analysis examined the distribution of HCV viral load at diagnosis in 66,640 individuals from 12 countries and established that 97% had a viral load greater than 1318 IU/mL and 95% had a viral load greater than 3,311 IU/mL. The key laboratory‐based assays (Abbott Real time HCV PCR, Alinity m HCV RT‐PCR, Abbott Real time HCV PCR) have an analytical sensitivity or LloD of between 5–15 IU/mL, and key PoC assays: HCV RNA PoC GeneXpert assays are 10 IU/mL for venous blood, or 100 IU/mL using fingerstick capillary blood. All these assays are therefore acceptable for diagnosis of HCV viraemic infection.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^113aXsRo]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy — monitoring, sustained virologic response (SVR) assessment, and simplified regimens for treatment-naive adults without cirrhosis are outlined as follows: Patients taking diabetes medication(s) should be informed of the potential for symptomatic hypoglycemia during and after DAA therapy, and glucose monitoring during and after DAA treatment is recommended; dosage adjustments may be needed, and patients taking warfarin should be informed of the potential for a change in their anticoagulation status with international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring recommended during and after DAA treatment; for others, on-treatment laboratory monitoring is not required unless a patient experiences treatment-related side effects or there are adherence concerns. Based on these data, 8 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is recommended for adults eligible for the simplified treatment algorithm. To assess treatment response, HCV-RNA and hepatic aminotransferase testing is recommended 12 or more weeks after completing DAA treatment, undetectable HCV RNA represents SVR and virologic cure, and in the absence of cirrhosis, persons who attain SVR require no liver-specific follow-up; for those with ongoing HCV risk factors, risk-reduction counseling is recommended and HCV-RNA testing annually or anytime an increase in hepatic aminotransferase levels occurs. Recurrent HCV viremia after attainment of SVR represents either reinfection or a relapse; with reinfection, treatment approaches are identical to those for initial treatment, and if relapse is suspected or cannot be ruled out, such patients should be managed by clinicians with expertise in managing HCV treatment failure. Persons who attain SVR but have persistently elevated hepatic aminotransferase levels require evaluation for other causes of liver disease; if retreatment is delayed or not feasible, assessment for liver disease progression every 6–12 months is recommended, and advise all patients, regardless of SVR, to avoid excess alcohol intake to prevent liver damage.

Hepatitis C retreatment after sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir failure — Among patients with a prior sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir treatment failure, 16 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir plus sofosbuvir and weight-based ribavirin is recommended based on the improved resistance profile of pibrentasvir and high response rate among genotype 3–infected participants, and extension to 24 weeks or longer with this regimen should be considered for persons with factors that may reduce the likelihood of achieving SVR; however, while there are case report data, no clinical trial data are available to support such an approach. A 24-week course of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir plus weight-based ribavirin is also recommended after prior sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir failure, but although there are currently no published clinical trial data that examine retreatment with the same regimen after failure, a small retrospective series included 4 persons who received 24 weeks (1 with ribavirin) and reported SVR12 was 100% (4 of 4). The recommendation to extend duration to 24 weeks with weight-based ribavirin when retreating with the same regimen is predominantly based on extrapolation from prior studies in different populations.

### Hepatitis B – more treatments, more testing, not enough data [^116TkLcQ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Published clinical guidelines, such as those from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), the US Treatment Algorithm, and the NIH Consensus Conference, offer recommendations as to the frequency of monitoring of ALT, HBV DNA, and HBeAg for different subgroups of chronic HBV patients. They also give recommendations as to when to initiate antiviral HBV treatment and guidelines as to the choice of drug or combination or drugs. Unfortunately there are several problems with these recommendations. For one, the recommendations are quite complicated. For example, for patients who are HBeAg positive and have ALT one to two times the upper limit of normal, the AASLD recommends monitoring the ALT every 3 months and monitoring the HBeAg every 6 months. However, if the patient is HBeAg positive but the ALT is less than the upper limit of normal, then they recommend monitoring the ALT every 3–6 months and monitoring the HBeAg every 6–12 months. For patients who are HBeAg negative with an ALT one to two times the upper limit of normal and HBV DNA between 2,000–20,000 IU/ml, they recommend checking the ALT every 3 months and the HBV DNA every 3 months. The purpose of this frequent monitoring is to determine when a patient may be transitioning from active to inactive phases of disease or vice versa, or when a patient would become eligible for antiviral treatment. However, the second and more significant problem with these guidelines is that there are no data to support the recommended frequencies for laboratory monitoring. While it is increasingly evident that ALT elevation and HBV DNA level are strong predictors of development of cirrhosis and HCC,–the recommendations for indefinite monitoring of ALT, DNA, and HBeAg every 3 or 6 months have never been studied in any randomized trial or been compared to other frequencies, and there are no data to show that such frequent monitoring leads to an increased use of antiviral treatment or a mortality benefit. The third problem with the current guidelines is that long-term management with this frequency of complex monitoring is an ambitious charge for providers and patients. The intensity of the schedule requires a significant burden of both time and resources for both providers and patients. Finally, as for the guidelines for the use of treatment of HBV, while there are clinical trials to support benefits and safety of each therapy or combination of therapies, the endpoints in HBV treatment trials have largely been surrogate markers, such as suppression of HBV DNA, normalization of ALT, and seroconversion of HBeAg to anti-HBe. However, to date, no randomized controlled trials of anti-HBV therapies have demonstrated a beneficial impact on overall mortality, liver-specific mortality, or development of HCC.

### True durability: HIV virologic suppression in an urban clinic and implications for timing of intensive adherence efforts and viral load monitoring [^114uMAvy]. AIDS and Behavior (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The primary risk of inadequate viral load monitoring is undetected viral rebound with potential immunologic decline, immune activation and progressive selection of resistance mutations that limit antiretroviral options. Although we are informed by data from clinical trials, we conducted this study to better understand the risk of viral rebound relative to time with virologic suppression in a complex outpatient clinic environment. Our findings have relevance for HIV clinic practices and further inform recommendations for the appropriate frequency of viral load monitoring and further consideration in appropriate timing for intensive adherence strategies.

Our prior examinations of CD4 cell count and viral loads from 1999 to 2011 demonstrated considerable improvement in median CD4 cell count and the percentage of patients with virologic suppression as also demonstrated elsewhere. Now, in the era of potent antiretroviral therapy and capacity for genotypic resistance testing to guide therapy, the occurrence of viral rebound may reflect our challenges with retention in care and adherence to antiretrovirals. It is therefore particularly disappointing that the risk of viral rebound is high out to three years. The clinic from which this data is derived provides both HIV care and primary care, has a "medical home" approach with a nurse practitioner– physician team for each patient, social workers and a clinical pharmacist on site as well as availability of an HIV psychologist. Though this model improves outcomes in the engagement in care continuum, we, like others have demonstrated this high early risk for viral rebound, indicating that further refinement of approach is warranted. These findings support not only the suggested higher frequency of early viral load monitoring, but also highlights the period of time when additional strategies are needed to keep patients in care and on treatment.

When stratified by CD4 cell count, patients with CD4 < 300 had a nearly double risk of viral rebound. Higher rates of viral rebound among patients with a low CD4 cell count in the first three years following virologic suppression is not unexpected. Patients with a low CD4 cell count (< 300 cells/µl) may represent a population who may have late HIV diagnosis, with very low nadir CD4 and immune restoration failure due to inability to reconstitute depleted T cell populations despite virologic suppression. Some also have a low CD4 due to a co-morbidity such as Hepatitis C and cirrhosis despite virologic suppression. However, those with a CD4 cell count < 300 are over-represented by those who are under-treated for HIV due to the failure to engage in care and attend visits to the clinic (even with two viral load measurements in 390 days, engagement in care cannot be assumed); and those who come to their visits but fail to take prescribed antiretroviral therapy.

### Twelve weeks of follow-up is sufficient for the determination of sustained virologic response in patients treated with interferon alpha for chronic hepatitis C [^114rg2Y3]. Journal of Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

The current standard for the determination of sustained virologic response in patients treated for hepatitis C is undetectable hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA 24 weeks following the completion of therapy. Sensitive molecular tests may permit earlier determination of sustained virologic response following the completion of therapy in end-of-treatment responders.

Methods

We examined this possibility in 1441 patients, who received 48 weeks of treatment with either standard or pegylated interferon alpha-2a. HCV RNA was determined by polymerase chain reaction assay (Amplicor HCV Monitor vs. 2.0) at baseline and monitored at 4-week intervals throughout the treatment and 24-week post-treatment follow-up periods.

Results

End-of-treatment and sustained response were achieved in 624 and 342 patients, respectively. For all treatments, relapse was most frequent at weeks 52 and 56 and became rare following week 60. Only six patients out of 348 patients (2%) became HCV RNA positive between weeks 60 and 72. Analysis of baseline characteristics failed to identify a specific set of parameters associated with early relapse.

Conclusions

This finding suggests that determination of HCV RNA levels at 12 weeks of follow-up may be sufficient for making decisions related to the management of most patients treated with standard or pegylated interferon alpha.

### Updated operational guidance for implementing CDC's recommendations on testing for hepatitis C virus infection [^1155nB74]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Current hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing guidance recommends a two-step testing sequence for diagnosis of HCV infection. Performing an HCV RNA test whenever an HCV antibody test is reactive (complete testing) is critical to achieve national HCV elimination goals. When an HCV antibody test is reactive and no HCV RNA test is performed, testing is considered incomplete. Historically, approximately one third of patients have incomplete testing. This update clarifies that all sites performing HCV screening should ensure single-visit sample collection. This approach allows for automatic HCV RNA testing when an HCV antibody test is reactive to avoid incomplete testing. Use of strategies that require multiple visits to collect HCV testing samples should be discontinued. Automatic HCV RNA testing on all HCV antibody reactive samples will increase the percentage of patients with current HCV infection who are linked to care and receive curative antiviral therapy.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data sources: Observational cohorts and clinical trials registries

We assembled a data set of patients with detectable HCV viral load at week 12 after completion of DAA treatment from clinical observational cohorts in nine countries, in addition to international clinical trial registry databases from two pharmaceutical companies. We identified potential cohorts for inclusion from four sources: (1) cohorts included in a previously published analysis of 12 countries for LoD at diagnosis; (2) cohorts that had previous collaborative projects with WHO or were known by our research team; (3) a PubMed literature search using the search terms 'HCV SVR' and 'cohort study'; and (4) conference abstracts from 2018 to 2020 at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver. We sent our study protocol (Appendix S1) and an invitation to join a research collaborative to the principal investigators of each identified cohort. We approached 19 cohorts and registries with HCV‐infected patients who had received treatment.

Eleven observational cohorts representing nine countries and two clinical trial registries agreed to collaborate and share data. To be included in the global data set, cohorts and trial databases were required to have the following patient‐level data: Detectable HCV RNA test at 12 weeks post‐treatment and linked demographic data per protocol (see Appendix S1). Observational cohorts were characterized by one of the following: (1) registries from country‐wide national HCV ministries of health (Georgian and Egypt national programs); (2) large healthcare systems (United States Department of Veteran Affairs or the UK); (3) non‐governmental organizations with programmatic data including across multiple countries (Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) sites in Mozambique, Cambodia and Pakistan); or (4) grant‐funded research projects (Myanmar and Ukraine).

Proportion of HCV genotype 2 and 3-infected patients who could be considered for shortened or extended therapy duration

In general, patients infected with HCV genotypes 2 or 3 should not be routinely treated for less than the currently recommended 24 weeks to avoid an increased risk of virologic relapse. However, patients with a low pre-treatment viral load (≤ 400 000 IU/mL) and an RVR (as determined by a highly sensitive assay) have the highest probability of achieving an SVR with 16 weeks of therapy (Fig. 4). Such a regimen may be a reasonable option for these patients, especially if tolerability of longer treatment may be a concern. The cut-off for low-viral load in patients with genotypes 2 and 3 based on the ACCELERATE data is ≤ 400 000 IU/mL. As with genotype 1, baseline viral load should be determined in two samples, taken at least 4 weeks apart.

Fig. 4
Overview of the ACCELERATE data: 16 vs 24 weeks. SVR: sustained viral response.

Shortening of treatment duration should not be considered for patients with cirrhosis, persistently normal ALT values or co-infection with HBV or immunocompromised patients such as those with HIV infection or those who have undergone liver transplantation.

There may be patient subgroups with genotype 2 or 3 infection that might benefit from extended treatment duration to reduce relapse rates. Results from the trial by Hadziyannis et al. found evidence for reduced relapse rates in genotype 2 and 3 pts with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis as well as high baseline viral load when treated for 48 weeks in comparison with 24 weeks.

However, due to insufficient data from prospective clinical trials, there is currently not enough evidence for such recommendations. It is possible that a higher, weight-based dose of RBV may balance the increased risk of relapse associated with a shorter treatment duration, but this remains to be proven. An overview of the proposed treatment strategy for patients with genotypes 2 and 3 is given in Fig. 5.

### Expert opinion on the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C [^111aosSJ]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2009). Low credibility.

Determination and monitoring of viral load

The decision on whether to continue or stop therapy should primarily be based on the level of HCV RNA during treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to measure viral load accurately. Important aspects to consider in this respect are the natural fluctuations in viral load during infection, as well as intra-assay (within an individual test) and inter-assay (between different tests) variability. Currently available commercial assays vary considerably in their dynamic ranges of quantification (Table 1). Despite the introduction of international units per mL (IU/mL) for reporting viral load, discrepancies may occur when patients are monitored using different types of assay. For example, rules for early discontinuation at week 12 and 24, as well as rules for determination of treatment duration [baseline viral load, RVR, complete early viral response (cEVR)], were established mainly with standard RT-PCR based assays, which have since been replaced by real-time PCR-based assays with higher sensitivity and broader dynamic range of linear HCV RNA quantification. The differences between commercial HCV RNA assays have been well documented in several studies, with the majority of studies showing an intra-assay variability of approx. 0.2 log. Generally, comparisons between Amplicor Monitor and CAP/CTM yielded comparable results (± 0.2 log), whereas comparisons between bDNA and Abbott real-time HCV on the one hand and CAP/CTM on the other showed a difference of 0.5–0.7 log. Additionally, HCV RNA viral load decline assessed during antiviral therapy can give different results, regardless of the use of IUs. False-positive and false-negative results, as well as variations in the HCV RNA level of up to 2 log 10 IU, have been observed, which may well have an impact on the management of patients, particularly if treatment decisions are made using a single HCV RNA assessment. Practitioners should be careful not to attach undue clinical significance to small changes (< 0.5 log 10) in serum HCV RNA level. The clinical relevance of serial HCV viral level measurements in a patient is dependent on continuous use of the specific quantitative assay employed in the initial determination of the viral level. This may imply repeated testing in some cases; but these extra costs may be justified if they affect treatment management decisions.

Initial treatment updates — genotypic activity has been added to the hierarchical ranking of treatment regimens, and there is a recommendation that sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir may be used as an alternative regimen for persons with genotype 3 infection and compensated cirrhosis; in the current direct-acting antiviral era of hepatitis C treatment, therapy is described as safe, effective, of relatively short duration, and curative in most people.

Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) adherence — Nonadherence during DAA therapy is relatively common, occurring in 11% to 40% of persons on treatment, and most episodes are short with 61% of nonadherent episodes lasting 1 to 2 days; these short periods were not associated with virologic failure. Sustained virologic response (SVR) 12 weeks after the completion of treatment (SVR12) was 94% among both adherent and nonadherent participants when nonadherence was defined as taking < 90% of the total prescribed dosage. Longer interruptions may adversely affect response: among F0 to F3 liver disease, SVR12 was 50% with < 4 weeks of DAA treatment versus 99% with ≥ 4 weeks; among participants with compensated cirrhosis, SVR12 rates were 83% and 95% in those who completed < 8 weeks compared with ≥ 8 weeks, respectively. Based on these findings and expert consensus, a management algorithm that considers the timing and duration of nonadherence and specific factors (genotype 3 infection and presence of compensated cirrhosis) is recommended (see Figure 2).

Chronic hepatitis C virus infection is well-recognized as a common blood-borne infection with global public health impact affecting 3 to 5 million persons in the United States and more than 170 million persons worldwide. Chronic hepatitis C virus infection is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to complications of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current therapies with all-oral direct-acting antiviral agents are associated with high rates of sustained virologic response (SVR), generally exceeding 90%. SVR is associated with a reduced risk of liver cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, need for liver transplantation, and both liver-related and all-cause mortality. However, a subset of patients who achieve SVR will remain at long-term risk for progression to cirrhosis, liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related mortality. Limited evidence is available to guide clinicians on which post-SVR patients should be monitored vs discharged, how to monitor and with which tests, how frequently should monitoring occur, and for how long. In this clinical practice update, available evidence and expert opinion are used to generate best practice recommendations on the care of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus who have achieved SVR.

HIV primary care — hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening — HCV screening with HCV antibody should be repeated every 12 months for persons at increased likelihood of exposure or when clinically indicated; HCV RNA testing is indicated for screening when HCV infection within the past 6 months is suspected and in those with previous HCV infection that cleared spontaneously or through treatment; screening with HCV RNA instead of HCV antibody should be considered for persons with severe immunodeficiency (CD4 count < 200 cells/μL); repeating HCV RNA after confirmed curative therapy (undetectable HCV RNA at least 12 weeks post-completion of treatment) is not necessary unless there is a clinical indication.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease, with approximately 71 million chronically infected individuals worldwide. Clinical care for patients with HCV-related liver disease has advanced considerably thanks to an enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, as well as developments in diagnostic procedures and improvements in therapy and prevention. These therapies make it possible to eliminate hepatitis C as a major public health threat, as per the World Health Organization target, although the timeline and feasibility vary from region to region. These European Association for the Study of the Liver recommendations on treatment of hepatitis C describe the optimal management of patients with recently acquired and chronic HCV infections in 2020 and onwards.

### Determining the lower limit of detection required for HCV viral load assay for test of cure following direct-acting antiviral-based treatment regimens: evidence from a global data set [^111Espcf]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

We also included clinical trials databases from two pharmaceutical companies who were responsible for originator DAAs (Gilead and AbbVie). We pooled data from relevant DAA trials into a single repository. Patient eligibility criteria varied by study trial, and the majority required a pre‐treatment viral load over 1000 IU/mL for enrolment and censored individuals who experienced on‐treatment virological failure. Both clinical trial databases were used individually to determine LLoD and the distribution of HCV RNA at treatment failure based on summary data at SVR12 assessment. However, only one database was able to provide patient‐level data to contribute to the multivariable regression analyses of factors associated with low‐level viraemia (LLV).

2.2 Characteristics of study cohorts

Most of the included cohorts have been well described in the literature. Table 1 summarizes key characteristics of these cohorts, including number of HCV‐treated patients, gender, age, and genotype distribution, DAA regimens and the proportion who achieved SVR following treatment. There was a high degree of heterogeneity in patient characteristics across cohorts, reflecting varying HCV epidemic profiles in different countries.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnostic algorithm for current infection or reinfection — For diagnosis of current initial HCV infection, begin with HCV-antibody testing and for recurrent HCV infection, begin with HCV-RNA testing; ideally, a positive HCV-antibody test automatically reflexes to HCV-RNA testing. Persons who have a reactive HCV-antibody test and a negative (not detected) HCV-RNA test should be informed that they do not have evidence of current HCV infection, with terminal pathways labeled "No Current HCV Infection" or "Additional Testing as Appropriate", whereas when infection is present the pathway labels "Current HCV Infection" and "Link to Care for Treatment or Retreatment". HCV-RNA testing is required to detect reinfection, and for persons who might have been exposed to HCV within the past 6 months or who are immunocompromised, testing for HCV RNA should be performed; repeat HCV-RNA testing if the person tested is suspected to have had HCV exposure within the past 6 months or has clinical evidence of HCV disease or if there is concern regarding the handling or storage of the test specimen.

### A minimal monitoring approach for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection (ACTG A5360 [MINMON]): a phase 4, open-label, single-arm trial [^112eTEna]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Background

Despite widespread availability of direct-acting antivirals including generic formulations, limited progress has been made in the global adoption of hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment. Barriers to treatment scale-up include availability and access to diagnostic and monitoring tests, health-care infrastructure, and requirement for frequent visits during treatment.

Methods

ACTG A5360 was a phase 4, open-label, single-arm trial across 38 sites in Brazil, South Africa, Thailand, Uganda, and the USA. Key inclusion criteria were age of 18 years or older, evidence of active HCV infection (HCV RNA > 1000 IU/mL) and HCV treatment-naive; patients with compensated cirrhosis and HIV/HCV co-infection were included but their enrolment was capped. All participants received a fixed dose combination of oral sofosbuvir (400 mg) and velpatasvir (100 mg) once daily for 12 weeks. The minimal monitoring (MINMON) approach consisted of four components: (1) there was no pre-treatment genotyping; (2) the entire treatment course (84 tablets) was dispensed at entry; (3) there were no scheduled visits or laboratory monitoring; and (4) there were two points of remote contact, at week 4 for adherence and week 22, to schedule outcome assessment at week 24 (-2 weeks to +4 weeks). Participants who missed the week 24 window could return for a visit to assess treatment response any time before week 72. Unplanned visits for any reason were permissible before the week 24 visit. The primary efficacy outcome was sustained virological response (SVR), defined as HCV RNA less than the lower limit of quantification measured at least 22 weeks post-treatment initiation; the primary safety outcome was serious adverse events. The primary efficacy analysis included all participants who initiated treatment, using a missing = failure approach. The primary safety analysis included all participants who initiated treatment and had at least one post-treatment assessment. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03512210.

Findings

Between Oct 22, 2018, and July 19, 2019, 400 participants were enrolled across all 38 sites; 399 initiated treatment. At the SVR assessment visit, 355 (89%) of 397 participants reported taking 100% of the trial medication during the 12-week treatment period; two patients did not have any follow-up visits after the entry visit and were excluded from the safety analyses. Overall, 379 of the 399 who initiated treatment had an SVR (95.0%, 95% CI 92.4–96.7). 14 (4%) of 397 participants reported serious adverse events between treatment initiation and week 28; none were treatment related or led to treatment discontinuation or death. 15 (4%) of 399 participants had unplanned visits; none were related to treatment.

Interpretation

In this diverse global population of people with HCV, the MINMON approach with sofosbuvir-velpatasvir treatment was safe and achieved SVR comparable to standard monitoring observed in real-world data. Coupled with innovative case finding strategies, this strategy could be crucial to the global HCV elimination agenda.

### Chronic hepatitis C therapy: changing the rules of duration [^112mGK5Q]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Traditional durations of therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis C can potentially be modified in hopes of cost savings, diminished exposure to medication side effects, and even improved rates of sustained virologic response. Clinical and viral kinetic studies suggest that shortened treatment durations for certain patients with genotype 2 and 3 infections might be equally effective as regimens of 24 weeks; for patients achieving undetectable viremia at 4 weeks of therapy, treatment durations of 12–16 weeks are sufficient. Nevertheless, abbreviated treatment courses might be inappropriate for those patients with advanced fibrosis or for genotype 3-infected patients with high viral loads. Similarly, if a rapid virologic response is obtained in those patients with genotype 1 infection and a low viral load, a truncated treatment course of merely 24 weeks is feasible. Conversely, slow virologic responders typically seen in genotype 1-infected individuals with high viral loads might benefit from an extended course of therapy; however, this approach needs to be validated prospectively. This review focuses on the evidence supporting such treatment individualization and discusses potential treatment algorithm modifications.

### Expert opinion on the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C [^113Z7vhs]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2009). Low credibility.

Shorter treatment for patients with a rapid virological response

The current 48-week treatment duration, recommended for HCV genotype 1-infected patients, may potentially result in the over-treatment of some genotype 1-infected patients who are more likely to achieve SVR, i.e. patients with low viral load before treatment and rapid virological response (RVR) at week 4. Clearly it is desirable to expose patients to the shortest possible treatment duration – without compromising efficacy – in order to minimize the likelihood of adverse events and reduce costs. Hadziyannis et al. found that more than one third of individuals with HCV genotype 1 who were randomized to 24 weeks of therapy with pegylated IFNα-2a plus RBV achieved SVR. Moreover, patients infected with HCV genotype 1 who became HCV RNA-negative by week 4, i.e. patients with RVR, were more likely to achieve SVR than those who did not become HCV RNA negative until week 12. A recent prospective trial demonstrated that patients with low baseline HCV RNA levels (≤ 600 000 IU/mL) and an RVR achieve an SVR rate of up to 90% (Fig. 2). Jensen et al. observed that almost a quarter (22.6%) of HCV genotype 1 patients treated with peginterferon plus RBV achieved RVR. Of these patients, 89% showed SVR after treatment duration of only 24 weeks. Both pegylated interferons have recently been approved in the EU for shortened treatment duration of 24 weeks for HCV genotype 1 patients with low-viral load (LVL) (defined as < 800 000 IU/mL for peginterferon alfa-2a and < 600 000 IU/mL for peginterferon alfa-2b) and RVR. To assure accurate determination of baseline viral load in cases with HCV RNA concentrations between 400 000 and 1 million IU/mL, physicians should consider performing two measurements using the same technique, from samples taken at least 4 weeks apart. Whether 10 or 50 IU is the most appropriate cut-off for determining RVR remains unclear, however, and is under investigation. Recently, Sarrazin et al. compared clinical outcomes for large cohorts of patients whose serum samples were analysed using both the COBAS TaqMan™ (detection limit approximately 10 IU/mL) and COBAS Amplicor™ (detection limit < 50 IU/mL) assays. In this study, RVR rates and subsequent SVR rates were similar when RVR was defined as undetectable of below 15 IU/mL by the COBAS TaqMan assay in comparison with undetectable (< 50 IU/mL) by the COBAS Amplicor assay, implying that HCV RNA levels rapidly decline not only to below 50 IU/mL but also below 15 IU/mL in patients achieving an RVR. Interestingly, relapse rates were consistently lower in patients with undetectable HCV RNA at week 4 by COBAS TaqMan™ compared with COBAS Amplicor™, although the full significance of this remains to be established.

### Applicability of hepatitis C virus RNA viral load thresholds for 8-week treatments in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection [^111sbdrA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Interferon-free treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection may be shortened to 8 weeks in treatment-naive, noncirrhotic patients with baseline HCV RNA levels of < 4 or < 6 million (M) IU/mL based on post-hoc analyses of phase 3 trial data. The applicability of these viral load thresholds in clinical practice is unknown.

Methods

Pretreatment and on-treatment serum samples (n = 740) from patients with HCV genotype 1 infection were included for HCV RNA analysis with 2 widely used assays, Cobas AmpliPrep/CobasTaqMan (CAP/CTM) and Abbott RealTime HCV (ART) assays.

Results

HCV RNA levels were significantly higher with CAP/CTM than with ART (overall difference, +0.11 log10 IU/mL; P < .001). In treatment-naive, noncirrhotic patients, discordance rates around the clinical cutoffs at 4M and 6M IU/mL were 23% and 18%, respectively. The mean differences between assays in discordant samples were 0.38 (4M) and 0.41 (6M) log10 IU/mL, respectively. Overall, 87% and 95% of treatment-naive, noncirrhotic patients, respectively, had baseline HCV RNA levels below 4M and 6M IU/mL with ART. These rates were significantly higher than those measured with CAP/CTM (64% and 78%, respectively; P < .001). Finally, discordance rates around the proposed thresholds in 2 consecutive samples of the same patient were in the range of 1%-2% for ART and 13%-17% for CAP/CTM.

Conclusions

Selection of patients for 8-week regimens on the basis of a single HCV RNA determination may not be reliable because viral load levels around the proposed clinical thresholds show significant interassay and intrapatient variability.

Rationale and Evidence

Updated Guidance from Clinical Organizations

Recent guidance from AASLD and IDSA recommends a test-and-treat strategy for persons with acute HCV infection on initial diagnosis without awaiting spontaneous resolution. Although spontaneous clearance occurs in approximately 25% to 45% of acute infections, delays introduced by waiting for clearance might be associated with substantial anxiety on the part of the exposed HCP, might result in lost work time and risk for transmission depending on the HCP's HCV RNA level, and might increase the possibility of loss to follow-up. Furthermore, emerging data about treatment of acute HCV infection with shortened courses of all-oral, direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens demonstrate potential benefit for treatment during the acute phase (,–).

Follow-Up Testing of HCV-Exposed HCP

For exposed HCP for whom follow-up testing is indicated, CDC continues to recommend early testing for HCV RNA at 3–6 weeks after exposure. HCV RNA becomes detectable on average within 1 week after exposure; most infected persons will have detectable HCV RNA within 1–2 weeks of exposure when tested with HCV RNA detection tests approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, CDC now recommends additional follow-up testing at 4–6 months for anti-HCV with reflex or follow-up HCV RNA if anti-HCV positive because of the possibility of intermittent periods of aviremia during acute HCV infection. This phenomenon has been reported previously among exposed persons, including those who progressed to chronic infection, primarily when using older HCV RNA tests (,–). Anti-HCV seroconversion occurs, on average, 8–11 weeks after exposure, although cases of delayed seroconversion have been documented among persons with immunosuppression (e.g. immunosuppression from human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection). Frequency of testing during the follow-up period depends on the management objectives and plan for timing of therapy if seroconversion occurs.

### Don't repeat hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody testing in patients with a… [^117Dx7m3]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

There are joint guidelines from the IDSA and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, which are consistent with guidance from the CDC regarding the testing, management, and treatment of patients with HCV infection. A positive HCV antibody test remains positive for life. Repeat HCV antibody testing adds cost but no clinical benefit, so it should not be performed. A common reason for unnecessary repeat testing is the inclusion of this test in order sets, or a result of problematic follow-up in patients positive for HCV in an outpatient setting. A positive HCV serologic test should be followed by a hepatitis C viral load test, which distinguishes an active from resolved infection. The result of the hepatitis C viral load establishes a baseline in patients with active disease by which the efficacy of therapy can be monitored. Patients with active infection may often need an HCV genotyping assay to guide therapy. Patients who have had a remote and resolved HCV infection who are suspected to have been reinfected should be tested using the hepatitis C viral load test, rather than the HCV antibody test, since this latter test remains positive for life. Viral load reflects the degree and severity of active infection and also acts as a useful component in monitoring antiviral therapy in medication-managed patients.

Key points
- Hepatitis C can be cured in more than 95% of cases with just 8–12 weeks of well-tolerated oral-only treatment with direct-acting antiviral agents.
- Curative DAA treatment is recommended for essentially everyone with hepatitis C.
- Clinicians can mitigate risk for advanced liver disease progressing with lifestyle counseling, co-infection monitoring, and recommendations for vaccination against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Treatment recommendations Except for pregnant patients and children under 3, clinicians should treat people with detectable HCV RNA in their blood with oral DAA therapy. There is no need to wait for potential spontaneous viral resolution. Clinicians should also:

- Conduct a full medical evaluation for chronic liver disease.
- Conduct a risk assessment and testing for HBV and HIV.
- Vaccinate against hepatitis A and hepatitis B as recommended.

Hepatitis B virus reactivation risk Some co-infected patients receiving DAA therapy for HCV infection have reported reactivation of hepatitis B virus infection. Therefore, clinicians should test all patients starting HCV DAA therapy for HBV infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the following tests:

- hepatitis B surface antigen
- antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen
- total antibody to hepatitis B core antigen Clinicians should monitor people who test positive for HBsAg or for an isolated positive anti-HBc for reactivation of HBV infection while they are receiving treatment. Learn more about treating HBV/HCV co-infected patients from the AASLD and IDSA. For more information on HBV reactivation, visit the American Gastroenterological Association. Helping patients stay well Your patient is considered cured of hepatitis C if there is no detectable HCV RNA after 12 weeks of treatment.

This indicates they have had a sustained virologic response to therapy. To help your patient stay well, you should also talk to them about:

- Maintaining a healthy diet and active lifestyle.
- Avoiding excessive alcohol intake.
- Checking with a provider before taking new prescription pills, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements. You should remind patients of proper practices to avoid HCV transmission while on treatment and to avoid reinfection after successfully completing treatment, like.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^111JH1PH]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis of acute HCV infection — testing recommendations and timing: HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing are recommended when acute HCV infection is suspected due to known exposure, clinical presentation, or elevated aminotransferase levels. HCV RNA typically becomes reliably detectable within 2–3 weeks after exposure, whereas HCV antibody typically occurs 2–3 months after exposure, on average; therefore, the best laboratory evidence is a positive HCV-RNA test in the setting of a negative HCV-antibody test or a positive HCV-antibody test after a prior negative anti-HCV test. When there has been a discrete, known, or suspected exposure, baseline HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing should be performed within 48 hours of the exposure; if baseline testing is negative, repeat testing for HCV antibody and HCV RNA is recommended, with frequency tailored to objectives (e.g., monthly testing to identify and treat acute infection).

ROLE OF HCV DIAGNOSTIC ASSAYS FOR ON-TREATMENT MONITORING AND POSTTREATMENT AND AS ADHERENCE MEASURES WITH DAA REGIMENS

Apart from some interferon-containing regimens, which rely on HCV load monitoring for assessment of treatment futility rules, decisions with regard to treatment duration with second- and third-generation DAAs are not guided by monitoring for treatment viral kinetics, although diagnostic tests remain critical for the management of patients with HCV. Virologic responses to the newest therapies depend not only on prior treatment experience, including response to previous anti-HCV treatment and other pretreatment clinical indicators, but also on viral genotype and subtype as well as baseline viral load in order to determine the optimal treatment regimen and its duration. The combination of the NS5B inhibitor sofosbuvir plus the NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir has been formulated into a single tablet, which has received approval in Europe and the United States for the treatment of HCV infections. Approval was granted based upon trials that reported SVR rates of > 90% (and up to 99%) in HCV genotype 1-infected patients treated with an all-oral, one pill/day regimen. The approved label for this combination indicates that treatment-naive noncirrhotic patients with a baseline viral load of < 6 million IU/ml are eligible for as few as 8 weeks of therapy whereas all others should receive a full 12 weeks of therapy. As seen previously with the establishment of RGT rules, no attention was paid during the establishment of this treatment truncation rule to the different performance characteristics of commercially available viral load tests and how they compare to those of the single, manual method used in clinical trials but not widely used in clinical practice. Independent studies designed to evaluate the clinical impact of assay variability and the time of sampling as determinants of treatment truncation for this regimen found that a substantial proportion of patients had fluctuating viral loads above and below 6 million IU/ml at different screening time points that could potentially impact treatment decisions. Based on the known bias between quantitative values given by HPS and ART assays and preliminary data from this and other studies, a viral load of 2 million IU/ml with ART could be considered equivalent to 6 million IU/ml with HPS.
