## Question

Tell me how a chronic, indwelling urinary catheter complicates re-occuring UTIs

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how chronic indwelling urinary catheters complicate recurrent UTIs. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and the baseline colonization dynamics. Then, I should analyze biofilm-mediated pathogenesis and why eradication is hard. Next, I will quantify morbidity and burden. After that, I should identify catheter-specific complications that perpetuate infection. Then, I need to evaluate management challenges, including the replacement paradox and asymptomatic bacteriuria. Next, I will review antimicrobial stewardship and treatment durations. Finally, I will integrate prevention strategies and synthesize why prevention and catheter avoidance are central to care.

> Let me first confirm definitions and the clinical context because precision here frames everything. A chronic indwelling urinary catheter generally refers to a device left in place for weeks to months, often up to roughly three months between scheduled changes in long-term care or community settings, used for persistent retention or incontinence indications, and virtually all such patients become bacteriuric over time. Wait, I should verify colonization rates and timing; long-term catheterized patients accrue bacteriuria at approximately 3–7% per catheter-day with near-universal colonization by one month, and the microbial ecology is frequently polymicrobial rather than monomicrobial, which sets the stage for recurrent infection rather than isolated events [^114kSjFo] [^116MPBnP].

> I will now examine biofilm-driven pathogenesis since this is the core mechanism that complicates management. Within hours of insertion, organisms adhere and elaborate an extracellular matrix, forming structured biofilms that mature and intermittently shed planktonic bacteria into the urine, thereby sustaining bacteriuria and episodic symptomatic flares; biofilm-embedded organisms exhibit marked tolerance to antibiotics and immune clearance, often quoted as 10–1000 fold higher than planktonic counterparts, and biofilm accretion can obstruct catheters, precipitating unscheduled exchanges and urethral trauma that further propagate infection risk [^116kXebe]. Hold on, I should double-check the link to outcomes; modeling and clinical observations converge that these biofilm dynamics explain why antibiotics rarely sterilize the system unless the device is removed or exchanged under the right conditions, which underpins guideline emphasis on device management alongside antimicrobials [^114kSjFo] [^114ms8Gg].

> Next, I should review the morbidity burden to avoid underestimating clinical impact. CAUTI incidence in long-term catheterized patients is roughly an order of magnitude lower than bacteriuria, around 0.3–0.7% per catheter-day, yet CAUTI still accounts for up to 40% of hospital-acquired infections and a substantial share of complicated UTI, reflecting the scale of exposure and device days across systems [^114kSjFo] [^114kSjFo]. I need to check the mortality signal carefully; in a prospective cohort of elderly patients with CAUTI and sepsis, 30-day mortality was approximately 31% and median survival was short, underscoring that recurrent CAUTI in frail populations carries high short-term and long-term risk regardless of early empirical therapy appropriateness, which did not significantly change outcomes in adjusted analyses [^115oT9V2].

> Let me consider catheter-specific factors that intensify the cycle of infection and relapse. Mechanical trauma and chronic mucosal inflammation from the device compromise host defenses and, when combined with biofilm and mineral encrustation, lead to obstruction, urinary stasis, high bladder pressures, and forced replacements that can inoculate new flora; these elements together create a permissive and self-reinforcing environment for recurrent infection [^116kXebe]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially attributed sex-specific susceptibility percentages of 70.0% for females and 65.4% for males to observational epidemiology, but I should correct that; those figures derive from a mathematical model linking urine production thresholds and bacteriuria risk, suggesting that fluid dynamics can modulate risk, not that baseline female risk is inherently that proportion across populations, so I should be explicit that this is model-based rather than epidemiologic fact [^114NQdRx]. I should also confirm the polymicrobial synergy point; co-localization of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis on catheters and in co-culture shows growth augmentation, illustrating how polymicrobial communities can increase virulence and therapeutic complexity in long-term catheterization [^1134tEpw].

> Now, I need to evaluate the management paradox around catheter replacement at infection onset. A prospective observational study in elderly long-term catheter users found no clinical benefit to routine catheter replacement at the time of symptomatic CAUTI after adjustment, which challenges a blanket replacement strategy in all scenarios and highlights the resilient colonized milieu that persists beyond exchanging the device itself [^117LsjqV]. Hold on, I should verify guideline positions so I do not overgeneralize; EAU guidance recommends removing or replacing the indwelling catheter before starting antimicrobial therapy, and IDSA guidance advises removing the catheter if it can be discontinued and replacing the device when it has been in place for more than two weeks at the time of CAUTI before initiating therapy, reflecting the need to reduce biofilm inoculum to improve antimicrobial efficacy, so the nuanced takeaway is to individualize within these frameworks rather than assume replacement has no role [^112BeWJp].

> Next, I should review asymptomatic bacteriuria, diagnostic differentiation, and stewardship, because overtreatment fuels resistance and relapse. Let me first confirm definitions; in catheterized patients, catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined by growth of at least 10⁵ CFU/mL of one or more species in a single catheter urine specimen in the absence of compatible symptoms, and this should generally not be treated because eradication is not durable with a chronic device in place and treatment selects for resistance without mortality benefit [^115owYCb] [^114ms8Gg]. I need to ensure I delineate symptomatic criteria; CAUTI requires symptoms or signs compatible with UTI with no other source and growth of at least 10³ CFU/mL in a catheter specimen or within 48 hours of catheter removal, and diagnostic stewardship interventions that curb low-yield urine cultures in catheterized patients can reduce unnecessary testing without delays in effective therapy, although effects on CAUTI rates may be modest [^117CdBiz] [^114SnA8f].

> I will now examine antimicrobial therapy principles and resistance considerations, since repeated courses in colonized systems escalate resistance. I should confirm durations; IDSA recommends 7 days for patients with prompt clinical response and 10–14 days for those with delayed response, and 3 days may be adequate for select catheterized women 65 years or younger without upper tract features after catheter removal, which helps avoid unnecessary exposure while ensuring cure in appropriate phenotypes [^116RiYrc] [^116EXLaV] [^116wYFkp]. Let me double-check prophylaxis guidance; routine systemic antibiotic prophylaxis at catheter placement, exchange, or removal, antimicrobial bladder irrigation, or adding antimicrobials to drainage bags are not recommended due to lack of benefit and risk of resistance, aligning with stewardship goals in this high-risk population [^113zY7ev] [^115aegRE] [^11223Vzr] [^116wSUpf].

> Next, I should review prevention strategies, because prevention is the most reliable way to break the relapse cycle. I need to ensure emphasis on minimizing catheter use and duration; remove the catheter as soon as it is no longer required and avoid use for incontinence management except in limited scenarios, and consider alternatives such as intermittent catheterization, external condom devices in appropriate men, or suprapubic catheterization depending on patient factors and residuals, recognizing that evidence strengths vary across alternatives [^116KDj4b] [^1162T71t] [^116w28WP] [^116F13z5] [^114ms8Gg]. Let me verify insertion and maintenance practices; aseptic insertion with sterile equipment and maintaining a closed drainage system are essential, while routine daily meatal antiseptic cleansing is not recommended to prevent CAUTI, and complex closed systems or taping junctions add no benefit, which aligns with standard bundle elements [^116hQAt1] [^114gMpNQ] [^116RDsZF]. Hold on, I should check device coatings; antimicrobial-coated catheters can reduce or delay bacteriuria in short-term use but have insufficient evidence for long-term benefit, whereas hydrophilic-coated catheters can reduce urethral trauma and UTIs with intermittent catheterization, and implementation bundles with reminders and nurse-driven removal protocols consistently reduce catheter days and CAUTI risk [^1167jRkV] [^112nDrsH] [^11732Ydm] [^11176wb8].

> Finally, let me synthesize why chronic indwelling catheters transform acute UTIs into chronic relapsing syndromes. Continuous biofilm-based inoculation, device-related trauma and obstruction, diagnostic ambiguity between colonization and infection, and the selective pressures of repeated antibiotics together drive frequent recurrence and rising resistance, while the device itself remains the root cause that antibiotics alone cannot sterilize; guidelines therefore prioritize avoiding placement, minimizing duration, and timely removal or exchange in conjunction with targeted therapy when truly symptomatic [^114ms8Gg] [^113hDkCR]. But wait, what if patient physiology could modulate risk even with a chronic device; modeling suggests urine production rate, influenced by fluid intake, may shift the threshold for long-term bacteriuria in some patients, a hypothesis-generating insight that does not replace core prevention but may complement it in select cases, and it reminds me to individualize recommendations within evidence-based guardrails [^114NQdRx].

A chronic indwelling urinary catheter complicates recurrent UTIs by enabling **biofilm formation** [^116kXebe] on catheter surfaces, which protects bacteria from antibiotics and the immune system, leading to persistent, polymicrobial, and often multidrug-resistant infections [^1134tEpw] [^115UNd2p]. The catheter provides a direct path for bacteria to ascend into the bladder [^114kSjFo], and **continuous bacteriuria** is nearly universal with long-term catheters [^116MPBnP], making eradication difficult and increasing the risk of symptomatic CAUTI and sepsis [^114kSjFo]. Catheter-related complications such as blockage, encrustation, and trauma [^116MPBnP] further promote infection, and standard prevention measures (aseptic insertion [^116hQAt1], closed systems, and early removal [^116KDj4b]) are less effective in chronic use, necessitating regular reassessment [^116abu8Y] and consideration of alternatives like intermittent or suprapubic catheterization [^114ms8Gg] [^116w28WP] [^1157nM4U].

---

## Biofilm formation and persistent bacteriuria

Biofilm formation develops when bacteria rapidly adhere to catheter surfaces, forming **protective biofilms** [^116kXebe] that shield them from antibiotics and immune responses, resulting in **persistent bacteriuria** and recurrent infections [^1134tEpw]. Persistent bacteriuria is almost universal with chronic indwelling catheters [^114kSjFo], often **polymicrobial** [^1134tEpw] and **antibiotic-resistant**, complicating treatment and increasing recurrence risk [^116MPBnP].

---

## Direct pathway for bacterial ascent

Direct bacterial ascent occurs because **indwelling catheters** provide a conduit for bacteria to reach the bladder [^114kSjFo], bypassing normal host defenses and increasing the risk of recurrent infections [^115UNd2p].

---

## Polymicrobial and multidrug-resistant infections

Polymicrobial infections are common with chronic catheterization [^1134tEpw], characterized by **complex microbial communities** that are difficult to eradicate [^115JBH9g]. Multidrug resistance is promoted by **frequent antibiotic exposure**, selecting for organisms that complicate treatment and increase recurrence risk [^1134tEpw].

---

## Catheter-related complications

Catheter blockage and encrustation [^116MPBnP] are common in chronic catheterization, causing **urinary stasis** and increasing infection risk. Catheter-associated trauma [^1118uV1x] may lead to **urethral injury**, strictures, and **bladder stones** [^112p7jpo], further raising infection risk.

---

## Ineffectiveness of standard prevention measures

Limited effectiveness of standard measures is typical in chronic catheterization, as **aseptic insertion**, **closed drainage systems**, and **early catheter removal** [^11176wb8] are undermined by persistent biofilm formation [^116kXebe] and continuous bacteriuria [^114kSjFo].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Regular reassessment is recommended by clinical guidelines [^11176wb8], with evaluation of **ongoing catheter necessity** [^116KDj4b] and **prompt removal or replacement** [^112BeWJp] when possible to reduce infection risk [^116abu8Y]. Alternative catheterization methods, such as **intermittent** or **suprapubic catheterization**, may be considered to reduce infection risk [^114ms8Gg] [^116w28WP] [^1157nM4U].

---

A chronic indwelling urinary catheter **complicates recurrent UTIs** by enabling biofilm formation, persistent bacteriuria, polymicrobial and multidrug-resistant infections, catheter-related complications, and limited effectiveness of standard prevention measures. Regular reassessment and **alternative catheterization methods** are recommended to **reduce infection risk**.

### The chronic indwelling catheter and urinary infection in long-term-care facility residents [^116MPBnP]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2001). Low credibility.

From 5% to 10% of residents in long-term-care facilities have urinary drainage managed with chronic indwelling catheters. These residents are invariably bacteriuric, typically presenting with a complex microbiological flora consisting of two to five organisms and a biofilm on the catheter that may contribute to obstruction. Residents with chronic indwelling catheters experience increased morbidity from urinary infections compared to bacteriuric residents without chronic catheters.

- **Prevention and management of infections**: The most effective means to prevent infection is by limiting the use of chronic indwelling catheters. Although appropriate catheter care and infection control precautions are recommended for managing these patients, the impact of these practices on the occurrence of urinary infection or the prevention of symptomatic episodes has not been evaluated. Symptomatic infections can likely be prevented by attention to catheter care, including early recognition and replacement of obstructed catheters and prevention of catheter trauma.

- **Prophylactic measures and treatment**: Appropriate use of prophylactic antimicrobial therapy prior to invasive genitourinary procedures is necessary. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated, but when symptomatic episodes occur, patients should be clinically and microbiologically evaluated and treated with appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Further technological advances in catheter material and urine drainage will be needed to substantially impact the frequency of urinary infections associated with chronic catheter use.

Regarding preventative measures for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, more specifically with respect to alternatives to indwelling catheters, the IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend considering suprapubic catheterization as an alternative to short-term indwelling urethral catheterization. This recommendation aims to reduce catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria (CA-ASB) and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CA-UTI).

### Urinary tract infections: 2021 update [^11176wb8]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) remains one of the most prevalent, yet preventable, healthcare-associated infections. It predominantly occurs in patients with indwelling urinary catheters. The duration of urinary catheterization is the most important modifiable risk factor for the development of CAUTI. Alternatives to indwelling catheters should be considered for appropriate patients. If indwelling catheterization is necessary, proper aseptic practices for catheter insertion and maintenance, as well as the use of a closed catheter collection system, are essential for preventing CAUTI. The use of intervention bundles and collaboratives helps in the effective implementation of CAUTI prevention measures.

### Different factors control long-term versus short-term outcomes for bacterial colonization of a urinary catheter [^114kSjFo]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Urinary catheters — thin tubes inserted into the urethra to drain the bladder — are commonly used in hospitals, especially intensive care units, and in community care for patients with urological issues. Approximately 30 million urinary catheters are used annually in the United States. The duration of catheterization varies from a few days ('short-term', e.g. in hospital, post-surgery) to up to 3 months, followed by replacement ('long-term', e.g. in community care settings).

Urinary catheters are highly prone to colonization by bacteria. This leads initially to catheter-associated bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine), which may be asymptomatic and not require treatment. However, bacteriuria can progress to symptomatic catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), with potential complications including localized issues such as catheter blockage and bladder inflammation, as well as the systemic and potentially fatal complication of sepsis.

Bacteriuria has incidence rates of 3–7% per catheter day and is almost universal in long-term catheterized patients. The estimated incidence rate of CAUTI is about ten times lower, at 0.3–0.7% per catheter day. In hospital settings, the likelihood of progression of bacteriuria to CAUTI has been estimated at 24%, although there is high uncertainty in this figure due to limited data. CAUTI are associated with a very significant societal and economic burden; for example, they account for up to 40% of hospital-acquired infections. Despite this, our understanding of the role of different factors in CAUTI development is limited.

### Microbial co-occurrences on catheters from long-term catheterized patients [^1134tEpw]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), a common cause of healthcare-associated infections, are caused by a diverse array of pathogens that are increasingly becoming antibiotic resistant. We analyze the microbial occurrences in catheter and urine samples from 55 human long-term catheterized patients collected over one year. Although most of these patients were prescribed antibiotics over several collection periods, their catheter samples remain colonized by one or more bacterial species. Examination of a total of 366 catheter and urine samples identify 13 positive and 13 negative genus co-occurrences over 12 collection periods, representing associations that occur more or less frequently than expected by chance. We find that for many patients, the microbial species composition between collection periods is similar. In a subset of patients, we find that the most frequently sampled bacteria, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, co-localize on catheter samples. Further, co-culture of paired isolates recovered from the same patients reveals that E. coli significantly augments E. faecalis growth in an artificial urine medium, where E. faecalis monoculture grows poorly. These findings suggest novel strategies to collapse polymicrobial CAUTI in long-term catheterized patients by targeting mechanisms that promote positive co-associations.

### Biofilms and catheter-associated urinary tract infections [^116kXebe]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Urinary catheter-related infections are commonly seen in several patient populations and lead to substantial morbidity. The overall healthcare costs caused by these infections are sizable, given the frequent use of urinary catheters in acute care settings, extended care facilities, and among individuals with injured spinal cords. Recent attention has appropriately focused on biofilm development on the catheter surface, as biofilm has important implications for the pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of catheter-related infection. Because the most important risk factor for infection is the duration of catheterization, indwelling urethral catheterization should be avoided or at least limited whenever possible.

- **Preventive methods**: Additional methods to prevent this infection include aseptic insertion, maintenance use of a closed drainage system, anti-infective catheters in patients at high risk for infection, and systemic antibiotics in select patients. Alternative urinary collection strategies may be appropriate in certain patient groups.

Specifically, condom catheters should be considered in men likely to be adherent with this urinary collection method. Suprapubic catheters should be considered in patients requiring long-term indwelling drainage, and intermittent catheterization seems appropriate in patients with injured spinal cords. Future research should focus on additional methods for preventing this common infection.

### Determining the noninfectious complications of indwelling urethral catheters: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112p7jpo]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Although the epidemiology of catheter-associated urinary tract infection is well described, little is known about noninfectious complications resulting from urethral catheter use.

- **Purpose**: To determine the frequency of noninfectious complications after catheterization.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Conference Papers Index, BIOSIS Previews, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for human studies without any language limits and through 30 July 2012.

- **Study selection**: Clinical trials and observational studies assessing noninfectious complications of indwelling urethral catheters in adults.

- **Data extraction**: Relevant studies were sorted into three categories: short-term catheterization in patients without spinal cord injury (SCI), long-term catheterization in patients without SCI, and catheterization in patients with SCI. The proportion of patients who had bladder cancer, bladder stones, blockage, false passage, gross hematuria, accidental removal, urine leakage, or urethral stricture was then pooled using random-effects models.

- **Data synthesis**: Thirty-seven studies (2,868 patients) were pooled. Minor complications were common; for example, the pooled frequency of urine leakage ranged from 10.6% (95% CI, 2.4% to 17.7%) in short-term catheterization cohorts to 52.1% (CI, 28.6% to 69.5%) among outpatients with long-term indwelling catheters. Serious complications were also noted, including urethral strictures, which occurred in 3.4% (CI, 1.0% to 7.0%) of patients with short-term catheterization.

### Different factors control long-term versus short-term outcomes for bacterial colonisation of a urinary catheter [^111SkG17]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

Urinary catheters are notoriously prone to colonisation by bacteria, resulting in high societal and economic costs. However, the pathways by which colonisation occurs remain unclear, and interventions to mitigate infection have shown mixed results. In this work, we present a quantitative mathematical model for the dynamics of urinary catheter colonisation that integrates bacterial population dynamics on the catheter surfaces and in the bladder with urine flow. Our model suggests explanations for the longstanding observations that some patients experience frequent infections while others do not, some infections develop more rapidly than others, and that sex and duration of catheterisation are key risk factors for catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI). Additionally, the model addresses why antimicrobial coatings show mixed efficacy.

Our model allows us to investigate which factors relating to the patient, bacterial strain, and catheter design influence clinically relevant outcomes for long-term and short-term catheterisation scenarios. These factors are embodied as model parameters. The most important finding of our study is that clinical outcomes for long-term and short-term catheterisation are controlled by different factors, as summarised in Table 2. Therefore, qualitatively different types of intervention may be needed to prevent infection for long-term versus short-term catheterised patients.

Long-term catheterisation is mimicked by simulating our model over several months, by which time the catheter is fully colonised and the model's behaviour no longer changes (it reaches a steady state). Here, we observe two distinct outcomes corresponding…

### Quality appraisal of clinical guidelines for recurrent urinary tract infections using AGREE II: A systematic review [^111CdVuE]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Low credibility.

- **Rigour of development**: Five CPGs were of high quality in this domain (range 5%–83%). Scores varied from low to high across all items for all CPGs. Several classification systems were used to grade the level of evidence (LoE), including the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM), and a modified version of GRADE. The updating procedures for most CPGs were either poorly reported or not reported at all.

- **Clarity of presentation**: Seven CPGs were of high quality in this domain (range 36%–90%). Most also scored high on all items, with only one scoring low across all items.

- **Applicability**: One CPG was of high quality (range 4%–68%). It was developed using the AGREE II tool. Otherwise, the CPGs scored low on all items in this domain, though higher scores were achieved for the provision of tools and advice on how to put the recommendations into practice.

- **Editorial independence**: Four CPGs were of high quality in this domain.

### Types of indwelling urethral catheters for short-term catheterisation in hospitalised adults [^116GjFUs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common hospital-acquired infection, primarily caused by indwelling urethral catheters. To mitigate catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), several measures have been implemented, including the use of specialised urethral catheters such as antiseptic-coated and antimicrobial-impregnated catheters designed to reduce infection risks.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective of this review was to compare the effectiveness of different types of indwelling urethral catheters in reducing the risk of UTI and to assess their impact on other outcomes in adults requiring short-term urethral catheterisation in hospitals.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group's Specialised Trials Register, which includes trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched on 9 September 2014). We also examined the bibliographies of relevant articles and contacted catheter manufacturer representatives for trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing types of indwelling urethral catheters for short-term catheterisation in hospitalised adults. 'Short-term' is defined as a duration of catheterisation intended to be less than or equal to 14 days.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors independently screened abstracts.

### Reducing unnecessary urinary catheter use and other strategies to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infection: An integrative review [^113YJ8VU]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2014). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) has long been considered the most common healthcare-associated infection (HAI), with the vast majority of these infections occurring after the placement of the convenient, uncomfortable, often unnecessary, and easily forgotten urinary catheter. With an estimated 449,334 healthcare-associated catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) per year, associated with an additional cost (in 2007) of US $749–1007 per admission (or an estimated US $3744 when complicated by bloodstream infections), it is not surprising that CAUTIs were among the first hospital-acquired conditions selected for non-payment by Medicare as of October 2008. They have been further targeted for complete elimination as a 'never event', with a national goal to reduce CAUTI by 25% by 2014. These national initiatives have renewed public and research interest in the prevention of CAUTI, prompting updates of several comprehensive guidelines and reviews of strategies to prevent CAUTI released since the 2001 Making Health Care Safer report.

### Diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of catheter-associated urinary tract infection in adults: 2009 international clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115aegRE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). High credibility.

The 2010 guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) focus on preventative measures for catheter-associated urinary tract infections. Specifically, they address the issue of antibiotic prophylaxis during catheter placement or removal. The guidelines recommend not administering prophylactic antimicrobials routinely, whether systemically or by bladder irrigation, at the time of catheter placement to reduce catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CA-UTI), or at the time of catheter removal or replacement to reduce catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria (CA-ASB).

### Replacement of urinary catheter for urinary tract infections: A prospective observational study [^117LsjqV]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2018). Low credibility.

To assess whether catheter replacement is associated with better clinical outcomes in individuals with long-term urinary catheters, this prospective, noninterventional study was conducted. The participants included individuals with a mean age of 79.2 ± 11.5 years who had an indwelling urinary catheter for longer than 7 days and a symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) (N = 315).

The exposure assessed was the replacement of the indwelling urinary catheter within 6 hours. The primary outcome was clinical failure at day 7. A propensity score model for catheter replacement was developed to match participants, and a multivariate analysis was conducted to adjust for other risk factors.

The catheter was replaced in 98 participants and not in 217. More than half of the participants resided in long-term care facilities and had high Charlson comorbidity scores. The rate of clinical failure on day 7 was 35.2% (108/306). The 30-day fatality rate was 30.8% (96/315). We found no statistically significant association between catheter replacement and clinical failure (propensity-adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.50–1.63) or 30-day fatality (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.40–1.44).

In conclusion, we found no clinical benefit of replacing a long-term catheter at the onset of the catheter-associated UTI. Further research is needed through randomized controlled trials.

### The association between indwelling urinary catheter use in the elderly and urinary tract infection in acute care [^1126E9E6]. BMC Geriatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Indwelling urinary catheters (IUCs) are routinely cited as the primary cause of nosocomial infections. On the other hand, previous studies have shown that decreasing IUC use is not associated with a decrease in UTIs. The present study showed that 28% of elderly patients who received an IUC were diagnosed with a UTI during their hospitalization. These data support the strong association between IUC use and a diagnosis of UTI that has been shown in previous studies. However, closer examination of the clinical data reveals that 53 (69%) of the patients who were diagnosed with UTI had either clinical signs/symptoms of UTI that were diagnosed and treated in the emergency department or they had an admission bacteriuria ≥ 10⁵ organisms/ml indicative of a preexisting UTI. Thus, only 9%, rather than 28%, of elderly patients who received an IUC developed a nosocomial UTI. This study suggests that when preexisting UTIs are eliminated from the data, the association between IUC use and nosocomial UTI may be weaker than has been previously thought.

There is general agreement that the use of IUCs is appropriate in specific clinical situations. Nonetheless, previous studies have shown that when using agreed-upon definitions of appropriateness for IUC use, only about 50% of IUCs are used appropriately. Our results support these previous findings by showing that in this elderly population with IUCs who developed a nosocomial UTI, only 54% of the IUCs were placed appropriately. However, this means that only 11 of the 277 (4%) patients aged 65 years or older who received an IUC developed a nosocomial UTI associated with an improper use of IUCs.

### Risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infections among women in a large integrated health care organization in the United States [^112bLb2m]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections, with an estimated annual incidence of over 150 million cases worldwide. In the United States, UTIs result in approximately 10.5 million office visits, as well as 3 million emergency department (ED) encounters and 400,000 hospitalizations annually, with an estimated annual cost exceeding $4.8 billion. UTIs primarily affect women, followed by male infants and older men. Based on epidemiologic data from a study in the United States, about 1 in 3 women have at least one UTI diagnosed by a clinician that requires antibiotic medication, and the lifetime risk of UTIs among women is greater than 60%.

Clinically, UTIs are categorized as uncomplicated or complicated. Uncomplicated UTIs (uUTIs) can be differentiated into lower (cystitis) and upper (pyelonephritis) UTIs. uUTIs typically affect individuals who are otherwise healthy. Approximately 75% of uUTIs are caused by extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and other pathogens. Complicated UTIs are associated with factors compromising the urinary tract or host defense, such as urinary obstruction, immunosuppression, renal failure or transplantation, and indwelling catheterization. In the United States, 70% to 80% of complicated UTIs are attributable to indwelling catheters, accounting for 1 million cases per year.

Regarding preventative measures for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, more specifically with respect to antimicrobial-coated catheters, the IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend considering the use of antimicrobial-coated urinary catheters, such as silver alloy- or antibiotic-coated catheters, in patients with short-term indwelling urethral catheterization to reduce or delay the onset of catheter-associated bacteriuria. There is insufficient evidence to support whether the use of such catheters reduces CA-ASB or CA-UTI in patients with long-term catheterization.

### The association between indwelling urinary catheter use in the elderly and urinary tract infection in acute care [^113t8Ry3]. BMC Geriatrics (2006). Low credibility.

The study attempts to replicate the findings of Gardam et al. with a larger sample. It focuses exclusively on elderly patients (i.e. those ≥ 65 years old). The purpose of this study was to:

- **Examine the frequency and appropriateness of IUC use**: This was done in the emergency department (ED) for elderly patients admitted to the acute care hospital.

- **Determine the percentage of elderly patients with an IUC diagnosed with UTI**: This includes those discharged from the hospital with a primary or secondary diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI).

- **Assess diagnosis and treatment for UTI in the ED**: The study looks at the percentage of patients with IUCs who were diagnosed and treated for UTI in the ED or who had admission bacteriuria ≥ 10⁵ organisms/ml, indicative of a preexisting UTI.

- **Evaluate inappropriate IUC placement and subsequent UTI diagnosis**: This focuses on the percentage of elderly patients who showed no indication of UTI on admission but had inappropriately placed IUCs and were later diagnosed with a UTI.

### Different factors control long-term versus short-term outcomes for bacterial colonisation of a urinary catheter [^114hD7ou]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Simulating our model for extended periods (several months) allows us to predict how the infection risks of long-term catheterization depend on factors relating to the patient, the catheter, and the infecting bacterial strain. For simulations longer than a few weeks, the bacterial abundances stabilize over time, as the model reaches a steady state. We observe two possible outcomes. One outcome, associated with bacteriuria, shows a high abundance of bacteria in the urine, while the other outcome, associated with no bacteriuria, shows a low abundance of bacteria in the urine.

The occurrence of these outcomes critically depends on the rate of urine production by the kidneys, which correlates with the patient's fluid intake. Varying the urine production rate leads to a transition in the model's behavior (Fig. 3a). For low urine production rates, bacterial growth in the bladder is sufficient to overcome dilution, resulting in abundant bacteria in the urine. In contrast, for high urine production rates, the dilution rate surpasses the bacteria's maximum growth rate in the bladder, causing a dramatic decrease in bacterial abundance in the urine.

From a mathematical perspective, this transition is continuous in the first order, with an initial near-linear dependence of the steady-state bacterial population density on the urine production rate (Fig. 3a lower inset); however, the time taken to reach the steady state diverges at the transition (Fig. 3a upper inset).

### A multicenter study of patient-reported infectious and noninfectious complications associated with indwelling urethral catheters [^1118uV1x]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The analysis also identified sex-related differences in reported complications, which makes some sense given the anatomical differences of the genitourinary tracts. Women are at higher risk for catheter-associated urinary tract infections than men because they have shorter urethras and closer proximity of perineal bacterial colonization to the insertion site of the indwelling catheter. For male patients, complications potentially associated with the presence of an enlarged prostate gland (e.g. urinary retention) were seen more commonly than the same complications in women. Although male sex was no longer an independent risk factor for noninfectious complications when assessed in a multivariable model including the AUA symptom index score, this is likely linked to collinearity with the AUA symptom index score.

Our findings have clinical implications. We should launch efforts to reduce the noninfectious complications of urethral catheters in the same way that we have used collaborative efforts to reduce catheter-associated urinary tract infections in some patient populations. Attention to the technical aspects of proper catheter insertion and maintenance, as well as increased focus on reducing unnecessary catheter insertions and unnecessary days of catheterization duration, seem likely to reduce noninfectious and infectious complications. As Meddings and colleagues concluded in a systematic review of 30 studies, reminders about an indwelling urinary catheter and stop orders should be used to improve patient safety because these approaches will reduce both types of catheter complications.

### Different factors control long-term versus short-term outcomes for bacterial colonisation of a urinary catheter [^114NQdRx]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

A typical value for the urine production rate in humans is indicated by the dashed line in Fig. 3a. This value lies very close to the threshold of 1.16 mL/min for the transition between bacteriuria and no bacteriuria, as predicted by our model (Fig. 3a), suggesting that individual long-term catheterised patients might show very different levels of bacteriuria depending on their fluid intake. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides data on urine production rates for randomly sampled adults in the US population (Fig. 3b). Comparing this data with the threshold urine production rate for long-term bacteriuria predicted by our model, we predict that 70.0 ± 0.8% of females and 65.4 ± 0.7% of males are susceptible to catheter-associated bacteriuria, meaning they are at risk of bacteriuria if they undergo long-term catheterisation due to urine production rates below the bacteriuria-no bacteriuria threshold. The remaining fraction of the population has urine production rates above the threshold and are predicted not to be susceptible to catheter-associated bacteriuria. For model parameters, see Table 1; for further discussion of the CDC data analysis, see Supplementary Information IV.B.

Our model, therefore, predicts that increasing urine production rate, for instance, by increasing fluid intake, decreases an individual's risk of developing bacteriuria. For example, we predict that increasing urine production rate by 300 mL/day (0.21 mL/min) would result in a decrease in the relative risk of bacteriuria of 8.9 ± 0.3% for females or 10.5 ± 0.4% for males (see Supplementary Information).

### Urinary catheter-associated infections [^115UNd2p]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Low credibility.

Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are common and costly hospital-acquired infections, yet they are largely preventable. The greatest modifiable risk factor for developing a CAUTI is the duration of catheterization, including the initial indwelling catheter placement when it may not otherwise be necessary. Alternatives to indwelling urinary catheters, including intermittent straight catheterization and the use of external catheters, should be considered in applicable patients. If an indwelling urinary catheter is required, aseptic insertion technique and maintenance should be performed. Through the use of collaborative, multidisciplinary intervention efforts, CAUTI rates can be successfully reduced.

### Empirical antibiotic treatment does not improve outcomes in catheter-associated urinary tract infection: Prospective cohort study [^115oT9V2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is the most common healthcare-associated infection. We aimed to describe the short- and long-term survival of patients with CAUTI and the impact of empirical antibiotic treatment on survival rates.

- **Methods**: In this prospective observational study, we included consecutive adult patients with chronic indwelling catheter-associated UTI and sepsis who were hospitalized in medical departments. The primary outcomes were 30-day all-cause mortality and long-term survival at the end of follow-up. A multivariate analysis using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards model was performed to identify independent risk factors for an adverse outcome. A propensity-score model for receiving appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy was constructed and used to match patients.

- **Results**: Overall, 315 consecutive patients with CAUTI were enrolled. The cohort consisted of elderly to very old patients (mean age 79.2 ± 11.5). The crude 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 30.8% (97/315). The median survival time was 82 days (interquartile range [IQR] 22–638). Appropriate early empirical treatment had no statistically significant association with 30-day mortality, with a propensity score-matched odds ratio (OR) of 1.39 (0.76–2.55). Similarly, in the propensity-matched cohort, appropriate empirical treatment was not statistically associated with long-term survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75–1.3).

- **Conclusions**: In our setting, patients with CAUTI had poor short- and long-term prognosis regardless of empirical antibiotic treatment.

### The association between indwelling urinary catheter use in the elderly and urinary tract infection in acute care [^114xD5Du]. BMC Geriatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Use of indwelling urinary catheters (IUCs) is considered the most significant risk factor for developing nosocomial urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, it is unclear how many elderly patients have preexisting bacteriuria prior to IUC placement. The purpose of this study was to determine:

- **Frequency and appropriateness**: The frequency and appropriateness of IUC use in the Emergency Department (ED) among elderly patients admitted to our acute care hospital.
- **Diagnosis and discharge**: The percentage of elderly patients with an IUC who were discharged from the hospital with a diagnosis of UTI.
- **Preexisting UTI indicators**: The percentage of patients with IUCs who were diagnosed and treated for UTI in the ED, or who had admission bacteriuria ≥ 105 organisms/ml indicating preexisting UTI.
- **Inappropriate placement**: The percentage of patients with no indication of UTI on admission who had inappropriately placed IUCs and were subsequently diagnosed with a UTI.

- **Methods**: This study utilized a retrospective chart review. Chi-square tests were used to assess the significance of differences in proportions.

- **Results**: Seventy-three percent of patients who received an IUC in the ED were elderly (≥ 65 years old). During the study period, 277 elderly patients received an IUC prior to admission. Of these, 77 (28%) were diagnosed with a UTI during their hospitalization. Fifty-three (69%) of those diagnosed with a UTI by discharge either had the UTI diagnosed in the ED or had bacteriuria ≥ 105 organisms/ml prior to IUC placement. Of the 24 elderly patients who developed a catheter-associated UTI (i.e. 9% of the elderly population who received an IUC), 11 of the IUCs were placed inappropriately.

### Urinary tract infections [^115S5uvo]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) remains one of the most prevalent, yet preventable, healthcare-associated infections and predominantly occurs in patients with indwelling urinary catheters.

- **Prevention strategies**: Targeted strategies for prevention of CAUTI include limiting urinary catheter use; physician reminder systems, nurse-initiated discontinuation protocols, and automatic stop orders have successfully decreased catheter duration. Alternatives to indwelling catheters should be considered in appropriate patients.

- **Proper practices**: If indwelling catheterization is necessary, proper aseptic practices for catheter insertion and maintenance, as well as a closed catheter collection system, are essential for preventing CAUTI.

- **Implementation measures**: The use of "bladder bundles" and collaboratives aids in the effective implementation of CAUTI prevention measures.

### Impact of diagnostic stewardship on catheter-associated urinary tract infections and patient outcomes [^114SnA8f]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Low credibility.

Diagnostic stewardship of urine cultures from patients with indwelling urinary catheters may improve the diagnostic specificity and clinical relevance of the test; however, the risk of patient harm is uncertain.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively evaluated the impact of a computerized clinical decision support tool designed to promote institutional appropriateness criteria for urine cultures from patients with an indwelling urinary catheter. Criteria included neutropenia, kidney transplant, recent urologic surgery, or radiologic evidence of urinary tract obstruction. The primary outcome was a change in the catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) rate from baseline (34 months) to the intervention period (30 months, including a 2-month wash-in period). We analyzed patient-level outcomes and adverse events.

- **Results**: The adjusted CAUTI rate decreased from 1.203 to 0.75 per 1,000 catheter-days (P = 0.52). Out of 598 patients triggering decision support, 284 (47.5%) urine cultures were collected in agreement with institutional criteria and 314 (52.5%) were averted. Of the 314 patients whose urine cultures were averted, 2 had a subsequent urine culture within 7 days that resulted in a change in antimicrobial therapy and 2 had a diagnosis of bacteremia with a suspected urinary source. However, there were no delays in effective treatment.

- **Conclusion**: A diagnostic stewardship intervention was associated with an approximately 50% decrease in urine culture testing for inpatients with a urinary catheter. However, the overall CAUTI rate did not decrease significantly. Adverse outcomes were rare and minor among patients who had a urine culture averted.

### Intermittent catheter techniques, strategies and designs for managing long-term bladder conditions [^1137kCg2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Intermittent catheterisation (IC) is a commonly recommended procedure for people with incomplete bladder emptying. Frequent complications include urinary tract infections (UTI), urethral trauma, and discomfort during catheter use. Despite the many designs of intermittent catheters, such as different lengths, materials, and coatings, it remains unclear which catheter techniques, strategies, or designs affect the incidence of UTI and other complications, measures of satisfaction/quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. This update of a Cochrane Review was first published in 2007.

- **Objectives**: To assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of different catheterisation techniques, strategies, and catheter designs, and their impact on UTI and other complications, as well as measures of satisfaction/quality of life among adults and children whose long-term bladder condition is managed by intermittent catheterisation.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 12 April 2021). We also reviewed the reference lists of relevant articles and conference proceedings and attempted to contact other investigators for unpublished data or clarification.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or randomised cross-over trials comparing at least two different catheterisation techniques or strategies.

### Reducing unnecessary urinary catheter use and other strategies to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infection: An integrative review [^116kk6D8]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2014). Low credibility.

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is a very common healthcare-associated infection (HAI). Krein and colleagues reported that CAUTI preventive practices lag behind efforts to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia. There is room for improvement in adopting catheter removal and CAUTI preventive strategies, as demonstrated by two recent large surveys of hospitals and ICUs. Fortunately, many resources exist to help hospitals develop and implement programs to decrease catheter use and prevent CAUTI. These include a range of tools and educational materials designed to address implementation challenges. Hospital and unit-level leadership also play a key role in preventing infection.

- **Monitoring and providing feedback on catheter use and CAUTI rates**: Inappropriate urinary catheter use is an easy habit to start and a difficult one to break. Consequently, many studies have emphasized the importance of ongoing surveillance and feedback as an intervention to reduce HAIs, such as CAUTI, and sustain prevention efforts. New national efforts to reduce CAUTI incorporate periodic feedback to participating units on urinary catheter use and CAUTI rates. The CAUTI rates evaluated include the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) rates and the newly described population-based rates. The population-based CAUTI rate incorporates both the NHSN rate and the device utilization ratio to account for interventions focused on the reduction in catheter use and improvements in placement and maintenance.

Important next steps to address CAUTI involve developing strategies to decrease the effort and resources required.

### Policies for replacing long-term indwelling urinary catheters in adults [^116PPivf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Long-term indwelling catheters are commonly used in individuals with lower urinary tract issues across home, hospital, and specialized health-care environments. Their use is associated with numerous potential complications and adverse effects. However, the impact of health-care policies regarding the replacement of long-term urinary catheters on patient outcomes remains unclear.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness of different policies for replacing long-term indwelling urinary catheters in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialized Trials Register, which includes trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and through manual searching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 19 May 2016), as well as the reference lists of relevant articles.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials investigating policies for replacing long-term indwelling urinary catheters in adults were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors independently conducted data extraction and assessed risk of bias for all included trials. The quality of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion among the review authors or an independent arbitrator. We contacted the authors of included trials for clarification if needed.

- **Main results**: Three trials met the inclusion criteria, involving a total of 107 participants in three different health-care settings.

### Diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of catheter-associated urinary tract infection in adults: 2009 international clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^117CdBiz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, the IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend to diagnose CA-UTI in patients with:

- **An indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheter** or intermittent catheterization.

- **Presence of symptoms or signs**: compatible with UTI with no other identified focus of infection.

- **Growth of ≥ 10³ CFU/mL of ≥ 1 bacterial species**: in a single catheter urine specimen or in a midstream voided urine specimen from a patient whose urethral, suprapubic, or condom catheter has been removed within the previous 48 hours.

### A scoping review on the impact of hydrophilic versus non-hydrophilic intermittent catheters on UTI, QoL, satisfaction, preference, and other outcomes in neurogenic and non-neurogenic patients suffering from urinary retention [^111sL3sa]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

There is no universally accepted definition of urinary tract infection (UTI) in individuals with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction. Most studies use either:

- **Symptomatic definition of UTI**: Defined as when antibiotic treatment has been prescribed.
- **Strict definition of symptomatic UTI**:
	- Antibiotic treatment has been prescribed.
	- Bacteriuria ≥ 10² CFU/mL.
	- At least one of seven UTI symptoms based on consensus guidelines (fever, autonomic dysreflexia [sweating, bradycardia, blood pressure elevation], increased spasticity, discomfort or pain over the kidney or bladder or during micturition, onset and/or increase in incontinence episodes, cloudy urine with increased odor, malaise, lethargy, or sense of unease).
	- Dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase.

However, other studies rely on self-reported UTI, bacteriuria, or alternative definitions, complicating direct comparisons or meta-studies. In this study, no exclusion or inclusion criteria have been defined regarding UTI definition. It could be argued that for catheter-associated UTIs, a higher level of bacteriuria should be accepted, similar to the catheter-associated UTI definition from the 2009 International Clinical Practice Guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. In general, it must be assumed that UTIs within both neurogenic and non-neurogenic patients suffering from urinary retention are either catheter-associated or a result of incomplete bladder emptying.

### The association between indwelling urinary catheter use in the elderly and urinary tract infection in acute care [^116zHnvB]. BMC Geriatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Approximately 4 million people each year receive an indwelling urinary catheter (IUC), and 5–20% of hospitalized patients who receive an IUC will be diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI). IUC use is considered the most significant risk factor for developing nosocomial UTIs, especially in acutely ill elderly patients. Indeed, the leading category of nosocomial infections are UTIs, and 80% of these are associated with IUCs. UTIs are linked to increased morbidity, mortality, length of stay, and costs. Even with improvements in nursing care of catheterized patients and experimental redesign of catheters themselves, UTIs remain a problem in catheterized patients. It is important, therefore, to carefully weigh the risks versus benefits in patients for whom an IUC is considered and to minimize the inappropriate use of IUCs.

The association between UTIs and IUCs in acutely ill patients is well-documented. However, this association does not establish cause and effect, and most studies that establish the association between IUC and UTI do not examine whether the UTI preceded IUC placement. One study by Gardam et al. showed that 2 of 24 (8.3%) consecutive patients with IUCs in the Emergency Department (ED) had a UTI prior to catheter insertion, and 5 of the 24 (20.8%) developed a catheter-associated UTI during their hospital stay. Three of these 5 UTIs were associated with inappropriate IUC placement. However, this study was small, urine cultures were not obtained consistently, and it included patients of all ages.

### Diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of catheter-associated urinary tract infection in adults: 2009 international clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116F13z5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, particularly concerning alternatives to indwelling catheters, the IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend considering offering condom catheterization if urinary catheterization is indicated. This is suggested as an alternative to short-term and long-term indwelling catheterization to reduce CA-ASB in cognitively non-impaired male patients with minimal postvoid residual urine.

### An update on prevention and treatment of catheter-associated urinary tract infections [^1156Qyet]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Catheter-related urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most significant nosocomial infections. This review summarizes the latest advances in the field of catheter care and the management of catheter-associated UTIs.

- **Recent findings**: The most efficient methods to prevent catheter-associated UTIs include avoiding unnecessary catheterizations and removing catheters as soon as possible. The use of different reminder systems and the implementation of infection control programs can effectively decrease catheter-associated UTIs, although their introduction can be challenging. There is still no evidence to support the routine use of antimicrobial-impregnated catheters, but the use of hydrophilic-coated catheters for clean intermittent catheterization can effectively reduce infections. Preliminary results with chlorhexidine-coated catheters are promising.

In cases of serious catheter-associated UTI in patients with a history of previous antibiotic therapy or healthcare-associated bacteremia, empirical antibiotic treatment should be initiated with activity against multiresistant uropathogens. Suprapubic catheterization is not superior to urethral catheters in terms of reducing the rate of catheter-related bacteriuria.

- **Summary**: A technology to prevent catheter-associated UTIs is still not available; however, there are promising results with new approaches such as the use of reminder systems and infection control programs, which can effectively decrease the rate of catheter-associated UTIs. There is evidence supporting the use of hydrophilic-coated catheters for clean intermittent catheterization.

### Quality appraisal of clinical guidelines for recurrent urinary tract infections using AGREE II: a systematic review [^113LspuT]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Low credibility.

The systematic search revealed 1,129 articles, of which 921 remained after removing duplicates, and 88 remained after title and abstract screening. Ultimately, 8 eligible clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were identified by full-text assessment. All CPGs were published between 2013 and 2021.

- **CPG selection and characteristics**: Two CPGs were written by international (urological) associations, with the remainder written by national urological associations of high-income countries. Six CPGs covered the full scope of urinary tract infections (UTIs) with a subsection for recurrent UTIs (reUTIs), and two CPGs focused on reUTI only. Seven CPGs covered both prevention and diagnostics, and one CPG considered only prevention.

### Urethral (indwelling or intermittent) or suprapubic routes for short-term catheterisation in hospitalised adults [^1157nM4U]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Indwelling urethral catheters are often used for bladder drainage in hospitals. Urinary tract infection is the most common hospital-acquired infection and a frequent complication of urinary catheterisation. Pain, ease of use, and quality of life are important considerations, alongside formal economic analysis. Suprapubic catheterisation can also result in bowel perforation and death.

- **Objectives**: To determine the advantages and disadvantages of alternative routes of short-term bladder catheterisation in adults in terms of infection, adverse events, replacement, duration of use, participant satisfaction, and cost-effectiveness. For this review, 'short-term' is defined as catheterisation intended for 14 days or less.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings. These were searched on 26 February 2015, with CINAHL searched on 27 January 2015, and the reference lists of relevant articles were also examined.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing different routes of catheterisation for short-term use in hospitalised adults were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors extracted data and performed a 'Risk of bias' assessment of the included trials. We sought clarification from the trialists if further information was required.

### Types of urethral catheters for management of short-term voiding problems in hospitalized adults: A short version Cochrane review [^1126DjuA]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2008). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common hospital-acquired infection, with indwelling urinary catheters being the major associated cause. There are currently many types of catheters available, including specialized urethral catheters designed to reduce infection risk. These include antiseptic impregnated catheters and antibiotic impregnated catheters. Other important considerations when choosing a catheter are ease of use, comfort, and cost.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective of this review was to determine the effect of the type of indwelling urethral catheter on the risk of urinary tract infection in adults undergoing short-term urinary catheterization.

- **Methods**: We searched the Specialized Trials Register of the Cochrane Incontinence Group (searched September 11, 2007). We also examined the bibliographies of relevant articles and contacted catheter manufacturer representatives for trials. All randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing types of indwelling urinary catheters for short-term catheterization in hospitalized adults were included. Short-term catheterization is defined as up to and including 14 days, or other temporary short-term use as defined by the trialists (for example, < 21 days with data time points at 7-day intervals). Data were extracted by one reviewer and independently verified by a second reviewer for both the original review and the update. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Data were processed as described in the Cochrane Handbook. Where data in trials were not fully reported, clarification was sought directly.

### The association between indwelling urinary catheter use in the elderly and urinary tract infection in acute care [^1153UzZW]. BMC Geriatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Use of indwelling urinary catheters (IUCs) is considered the most significant risk factor for developing nosocomial urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, it is unclear how many elderly patients have preexisting bacteriuria prior to IUC placement.

The purpose of this study was to determine:

- **Frequency and appropriateness of IUC use**: in the Emergency Department (ED) among elderly patients admitted to our acute care hospital.
- **Percentage of elderly patients with an IUC who were discharged from the hospital with a diagnosis of UTI**.
- **Percentage of patients with IUCs diagnosed and treated for UTI**: in the ED or who had admission bacteriuria ≥ 10⁵ organisms/ml indicating preexisting UTI.
- **Percentage of patients with no indication of UTI on admission who had inappropriately placed IUCs** and subsequently were diagnosed with a UTI.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was conducted. The chi-square test was used to evaluate the significance of differences in proportions.

- **Results**:
	- Seventy-three percent of patients who received an IUC in the ED were elderly (≥ 65 years old). During the study period, 277 elderly patients received an IUC prior to admission. Of these, 77 (28%) were diagnosed with a UTI during their hospitalization. Fifty-three (69%) of those diagnosed with a UTI by discharge either had the UTI diagnosed in the ED or had bacteriuria ≥ 10⁵ organisms/ml prior to IUC placement. Of the 24 elderly patients who developed a catheter-associated UTI (i.e. 9% of the elderly population who received an IUC), 11 of the IUCs were placed inappropriately. Thus, 4% of elderly patients…

Regarding preventative measures for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, specifically in relation to systemic antibiotic prophylaxis, the IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend not administering systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis routinely to reduce catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria (CA-ASB) or catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CA-UTI) in patients with short-term or long-term catheterization, including those undergoing surgical procedures.

### Diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of catheter-associated urinary tract infection in adults: 2009 international clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114nTkae]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). High credibility.

Regarding quality improvement for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, more specifically with respect to infection prevention, the IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend considering the implementation of feedback strategies for CA-ASB rates to nurses and physicians on a regular basis to reduce the risk of CA-ASB. There is insufficient evidence to support whether such an intervention might reduce the risk of CA-UTI.

### Different factors control long-term versus short-term outcomes for bacterial colonisation of a urinary catheter [^114KmPN3]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

For short-term catheterisation, the early-time colonisation dynamics of the model are relevant — specifically, how fast bacteria migrate up the catheter and colonise the bladder. A short-term catheterised patient will only develop bacteriuria (and potentially CAUTI) if the onset time for bacteriuria is shorter than the duration of catheterisation. Hence, delaying the onset of bacteriuria can be a useful strategy for short-term catheterised patients. Our model shows that the time taken by bacteria to migrate up the catheter depends linearly on urethral length, consistent with the fact that sex is a strong risk factor. Other parameters associated with the bacteria-surface interaction — bacterial growth rate and motility on the surface — are also relevant for the onset time. Thus, our model suggests that interventions that alter bacteria-surface interactions, such as antimicrobial coatings, might be effective for short-term catheterised patients only.

Reports on the efficacy of antimicrobial coatings have been mixed. A systematic review in 2008 found that both silver-alloy coated and antibiotic-impregnated catheters were effective in reducing the risk of catheter-associated urinary tract infection for short-term catheterised patients (in that study, defined as < 1 week) but were not effective for long-term catheterised patients. However, a subsequent randomised control trial in 2012 that focused on short-term catheterisation (here defined as < 2 weeks) found that silver-alloy coated catheters were not effective, while antibiotic-impregnated catheters had only limited efficacy.

### Different factors control long-term versus short-term outcomes for bacterial colonisation of a urinary catheter [^116U4bK4]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

Our mathematical model for catheter colonisation consists of four parts: the outside surface of the catheter, the bladder, the urine flow within the catheter, and the luminal (inside) surface of the catheter. We model bacterial growth and motility, where relevant, in each part of the model and allow bacteria to move between the different parts. Colonising bacteria may originate anywhere within the system, permitting all major infection pathways, such as bacteria spreading up the outside surface or luminal surface, as well as an infection originating in the bladder (e.g. following a catheter is replaced).

The catheter is treated as a rigid, open, cylindrical tube with rotational symmetry. The bladder is assumed to contain a well-mixed pool of residual urine, and the rate of urine production and the volume of residual urine are considered constant. We assume colonisation by a single bacterial species and base our parameters on E. coli, which is present in 40–70% of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI). Our model does not include the human host's response and therefore does not distinguish between asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic (CAUTI) infection.

Computer simulations of the model lead to predictions for the dynamics of bacterial infection on the catheter and in the bladder, including the abundance of bacteria in the urine and at different positions on the outside and luminal catheter surfaces at different times. Full details of the model and its implementation can be found in the supplementary materials.

### Different factors control long-term versus short-term outcomes for bacterial colonisation of a urinary catheter [^115UZBcr]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

In the model, the time to bacteriuria is controlled by how long the bacterial wave takes to spread up the catheter to reach the bladder. Therefore, as well as catheter length, the speed of the bacterial wave is important, which in our model depends on the bacterial growth rate and mobility on the catheter surface (Eq. 1). Antimicrobial coated catheters, in which the surface is coated or impregnated with an antimicrobial substance such as silver ions or nitrofural, are commercially available, although they have shown mixed efficacy in preventing CAUTI in clinical trials. These coatings aim to alter the interaction between bacteria and the catheter surface by killing bacteria or preventing adhesion. Our model suggests that an antimicrobial coating would not affect the long-term clinical outcome (bacteriuria or no bacteriuria) for long-term catheterised patients, but it could delay the onset of bacteriuria in short-term catheterised patients, especially male patients (who have a longer urethra than female patients), by altering the time taken for the bacterial wave to reach the bladder.

In our computer simulations, we assumed that migration of bacteria up the catheter is slow relative to their proliferation in the bladder. Different outcomes would be expected if bacteria are either highly motile on the catheter surface or very slow-growing in the bladder. In this fast-migration/slow-growth regime, the rate-limiting step would be growth in the bladder rather than migration up the catheter and parameters associated with bacterial growth in the bladder.
