## Question

A group of hikers is struck by lightning during a thunderstorm on a remote mountain trail. When emergency responders arrive, they find five victims: one is unresponsive and not breathing, another is unresponsive but has weak spontaneous respirations, two are conscious but confused with visible burns, and one is alert with minor tingling in the limbs. The weather has cleared and the scene is now safe for rescue operations. The responders must decide how to triage and evacuate the victims.

Based on current guideline recommendations for lightning injury triage and evacuation, which victim(s) should be prioritized for immediate resuscitation and evacuation, and what triage strategy should be used in this scenario? Justify your answer according to the guideline.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to triage and evacuate five lightning strike victims on a remote mountain trail, including who to prioritize for immediate resuscitation and evacuation and what triage strategy to apply. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming scene safety and the unique pathophysiology of lightning injury. Then, I should verify the recommended triage strategy for lightning mass casualties. Next, I will classify each victim by severity and map them to evacuation priorities. After that, I need to check for keraunoparalysis and other mimics that could alter resuscitation decisions. Finally, I will outline immediate interventions, evacuation sequencing, and special considerations like burns, neurologic injury, and cardiac monitoring, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm scene safety and the lightning-specific pathophysiology, because everything hinges on these foundations. The weather has cleared and the scene is declared safe for rescue operations, so responders can proceed without delay, and importantly, lightning victims do not retain a residual electrical charge, so it is safe to touch and treat them immediately once the scene is secure [^5d8b4398] [^ef1c6003]. Lightning typically causes simultaneous cardiac and respiratory arrest; cardiac automaticity often returns before respiratory drive, so ROSC may precede resolution of respiratory arrest, which is why early ventilatory support is critical and why a reverse triage approach is recommended in multi-casualty lightning events [^b98a61dc].

> Wait, let me verify the triage strategy before assigning priorities. Traditional trauma triage prioritizes the most severely injured who are likely to survive, but in lightning mass casualties, guidelines recommend reverse triage: treat those without pulses or respirations first because lightning arrest victims have a high likelihood of successful resuscitation if addressed early, and ventilatory support should be initiated promptly since ROSC often precedes spontaneous breathing [^f66ed8e7] [^b98a61dc] [^ef1c6003]. I should double-check that this applies here: yes, with five victims and two in critical airway/respiratory failure, reverse triage is appropriate and should guide sequencing of care and evacuation [^f66ed8e7].

> Now, I will classify the victims by severity and map evacuation priorities, but hold on, I should verify each assignment against the guidelines. Victim A is unresponsive, apneic, and pulseless; this is cardiac arrest from lightning and warrants immediate high-priority resuscitation and evacuation as an immediate/red category patient under reverse triage [^f66ed8e7] [^b98a61dc]. Victim B is unresponsive with weak, agonal respirations; this represents impending respiratory arrest and should be treated as high-priority immediate for airway/ventilatory support and rapid evacuation [^f66ed8e7] [^b98a61dc]. Victims C and D are conscious but confused with visible burns; they are high-risk lightning injuries requiring urgent evacuation after stabilization, typically yellow/delayed but prioritized early given lightning-specific risk and the need for cardiac monitoring and burn care [^c407a44d] [^de07fd23]. Victim E is alert with minor paresthesias; this is lower-risk but still requires evacuation for evaluation, generally green/minimal but not deferred indefinitely [^c407a44d] [^de07fd23].

> I need to ensure I account for keraunoparalysis, which can mimic pulselessness. Before starting CPR, I should check a central pulse because transient paralysis with pallor and absent peripheral pulses can occur after lightning and typically resolves within hours; if keraunoparalysis is suspected, I should avoid unnecessary chest compressions and maintain spinal precautions while arranging evacuation for observation and imaging if deficits persist [^c1eec352] [^d55a598f]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to both Victim A and Victim B; yes, central pulse assessment is essential in all unresponsive lightning patients before initiating CPR to avoid harming those with reversible paralysis rather than true arrest [^c1eec352].

> Next, I should review immediate interventions and evacuation sequencing, and I will double-check that each step aligns with guidance. For Victim A, initiate immediate CPR with emphasis on ventilations, apply an AED as available, and prepare for rapid evacuation with ongoing resuscitation; lightning arrest victims have high rates of successful resuscitation when treated promptly, supporting aggressive early care and transport [^5d8b4398] [^ef1c6003]. For Victim B, secure the airway with basic or advanced measures as feasible, provide ventilatory support, and evacuate urgently; early ventilation is emphasized because ROSC may precede return of spontaneous respirations [^f66ed8e7] [^b98a61dc]. For Victims C and D, establish IV access, initiate cardiac monitoring, dress burns, treat pain, and evacuate as high-priority; high-risk lightning patients warrant ECG and echocardiography once evacuated, and telemetry monitoring is recommended for direct strikes or abnormal screens [^7ba84111] [^3d8d1723] [^b9458d11]. For Victim E, provide reassurance, monitor neurologic status, and evacuate for evaluation; even minor symptoms merit assessment for delayed complications [^c407a44d] [^de07fd23].

> Let me consider special issues that could change management, and I should confirm each against guidelines. Burns are common but superficial and often do not dictate fluid needs; in mass casualty burns contexts, routine prehospital IV fluids are discouraged unless there are prolonged delays or specific indications, so I should avoid over-resuscitation in the field and prioritize rapid transport for definitive burn care and monitoring [^ccea21fc] [^4d07a5b9]. Neurologic injury, including loss of consciousness or persistent deficits, warrants head CT once evacuated; transient neurologic symptoms are common, but persistent abnormalities or LOC justify imaging and observation [^75fb6c38] [^c3f50b16]. Cardiac complications can be delayed, so all high-risk patients should have ECG and consideration of echocardiography and telemetry; new chest pain or dyspnea after discharge should prompt urgent re-evaluation [^7ba84111] [^3d8d1723] [^85280b4d].

> I should double-check evacuation logistics and documentation, because coordination affects outcomes. In mass casualty lightning events, evacuate those without pulses or respirations first, then those with respiratory compromise, then high-risk stable patients, and finally lower-risk patients; document mechanism, injuries, interventions, and triage category to support handoff and hospital preparedness [^f66ed8e7] [^c407a44d]. If available, consider aeromedical transport for the most critical patients, balancing weather risk and scene safety, and communicate with receiving facilities about expected lightning injuries and monitoring needs [^c407a44d] [^de07fd23].

> Putting this together, my final prioritization is as follows, and I will sanity-check it one more time against reverse triage principles. Immediate priority for resuscitation and evacuation: Victim A (cardiac arrest) and Victim B (agonal respirations), with Victim A slightly ahead if resources are limited; both require aggressive airway and ventilatory support and rapid transport. Urgent evacuation: Victims C and D (confused with burns), for cardiac monitoring, burn care, and neurologic assessment. Non-urgent but necessary evacuation: Victim E (alert with paresthesias), for evaluation and observation for delayed sequelae. This sequence aligns with WMS reverse triage and national prehospital guidance for lightning mass casualties [^f66ed8e7] [^b98a61dc] [^ef1c6003].

---

In lightning mass-casualty events, use **reverse triage** [^f66ed8e7] and prioritize patients without pulses or respirations for immediate CPR and evacuation, as they have the highest likelihood of recovery with early intervention [^ef1c6003]. Victims with **respiratory arrest** or **agonal respirations** are second priority, followed by those with altered mental status or burns. Alert patients with minor symptoms are lowest priority but still require evacuation for monitoring. Evacuate all patients to a facility with cardiac monitoring and burn care capabilities, and ensure continuous resuscitation during transport [^c407a44d].

---

## Pathophysiology and clinical presentation

Lightning strikes cause **simultaneous cardiac and respiratory arrest** [^b98a61dc]; cardiac automaticity often returns before respiratory drive, so ROSC may precede resolution of respiratory arrest [^f66ed8e7]. This unique pattern underpins the **reverse triage** approach [^f66ed8e7].

---

## Triage strategy: reverse triage

Reverse triage prioritizes patients without pulses or respirations for immediate CPR and evacuation, as early intervention yields high recovery rates [^ef1f6003]. This approach is **recommended by the Wilderness Medical Society (WMS)** [^f66ed8e7] and national prehospital guidelines [^8e0efb61].

---

## Application to the scenario

| **Victim** | **Clinical status** | **Priority** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Victim 1 | Unresponsive, not breathing | Immediate | Cardiac arrest; highest likelihood of recovery with early CPR [^ef1f6003] |
| Victim 2 | Unresponsive, weak respirations | Immediate | Respiratory arrest; early ventilatory support critical [^f66ed8e7] |
| Victims 3 & 4 | Conscious, confused, burns | Urgent | Altered mental status and burns indicate significant injury [^c407a44d] |
| Victim 5 | Alert, minor tingling | Delayed | Lower priority but still requires monitoring [^c407a44d] |

---

## Evacuation priorities

- **Immediate evacuation**: Victims 1 and 2 require continuous CPR and ventilatory support during transport [^f66ed8e7].
- **Urgent evacuation**: Victims 3 and 4 need monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias, neurological complications, and burn care [^7ba84111].
- **Delayed evacuation**: Victim 5 should be monitored for delayed neurological or cardiac complications [^339ffe57].

---

## Medical management considerations

- **Airway and breathing**: Secure airways and provide ventilatory support, especially for victims with respiratory compromise [^f66ed8e7].
- **Circulation**: Initiate CPR for cardiac arrest and monitor for arrhythmias [^5d8b4398].
- **Neurological assessment**: Evaluate for keraunoparalysis, seizures, and altered mental status [^c1eec352].
- **Burn care**: Cover burns, manage pain, and monitor for infection [^notfound].
- **Cardiac monitoring**: Continuous ECG monitoring is essential for all victims [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Use **reverse triage** to prioritize victims without pulses or respirations for immediate CPR and evacuation, followed by those with respiratory compromise, then those with altered mental status or burns, and finally alert patients with minor symptoms. Evacuate all patients to facilities with cardiac monitoring and burn care, and maintain continuous resuscitation during transport [^c407a44d].

Lightning/Lightning Strike Injury — patient safety and triage considerations include the following. Recognize that repeat strike is a risk. Patient and rescuer safety is paramount. Victims do not carry or discharge a current, so the patient is safe to touch and treat. Lightning strike cardiopulmonary arrest patients have a high rate of successful resuscitation, if initiated early, in contrast to general cardiac arrest statistics. There may be multiple victims. If multiple victims, cardiac arrest patients whose injury was witnessed or thought to be recent should be treated first and aggressively (reverse from traditional triage practices). Patients suffering cardiac arrest from lightning strike initially suffer a combined cardiac and respiratory arrest. Return of spontaneous circulation may precede resolution of respiratory arrest. Patients may be successfully resuscitated if provided proper cardiac and respiratory support, highlighting the value of "reverse triage". It may not be immediately apparent that the patient is a lightning strike victim. Injury pattern and secondary physical exam findings may be key in identifying patient as a victim of lightning strike. Lightning strike is a result of very high voltage, very short duration DC current exposure.

Mass critical care events are increasingly likely, yet the resource challenges to augment everyday, unrestricted critical care for a surge of disaster victims are insurmountable for nearly all communities. In light of these limitations, an expert panel defined a circumscribed set of key critical care interventions that they believed could be offered to many additional people and yet would also continue to offer substantial life-sustaining benefits for nonmoribund critically ill and injured people. They proposed Emergency Mass Critical Care, which is based on the set of key interventions and includes recommendations for necessary surge medical equipment, treatment space characteristics, and staffing competencies for mass critical care response. To date, Emergency Mass Critical Care is untested, and the real benefits of implementation remain uncertain. Nonetheless, Emergency Mass Critical Care currently remains the only comprehensive construct for mass critical care preparedness and response. This paper reviews current concepts to provide life-sustaining care for hundreds or thousands of people outside of traditional critical care sites.

Keraunoparalysis after lightning strike: Signs and symptoms include lack of pulse, pallor or cyanosis, and motor and sensory loss in the affected extremities, and keraunoparalysis typically resolves within several hours; as it may mimic a pulseless victim, be vigilant to check a central pulse before starting cardiopulmonary resuscitation. We recommend hospital observation for keraunoparalysis. This phenomenon typically resolves spontaneously but may indicate more serious underlying trauma. Recommendation grade: 1C. Keraunoparalysis can mimic a spinal injury; thus, spinal precautions should be maintained and diagnostic imaging should be performed to rule out spinal cord injury if neurologic deficits persist despite resolution of pallor or pulselessness. Recommendation grade: 1C.

Trauma mass casualty incident — notes and educational pearls state that the most experienced EMS (emergency medical services) clinician should perform triage, another experienced EMS clinician should be assigned to the immediate patient area and perform life-saving interventions as well as continuous triage, prioritize patients within the immediate group for transport, and if available another EMS clinician should be assigned to the delayed area and perform urgent interventions if patient condition changes with continuous triage and prioritization for transport; patient triage category may change with subsequent triage and if up-triage is needed perform life-saving interventions and move the patient to the appropriate triage area (delayed or immediate); EMS system leaders within a defined area should work collaboratively to agree upon a common triage tool; and evidence is limited on the highest performing triage tool, with available evidence suggesting that the SALT triage tool was most likely to correctly triage adult emergency department patients, but all tested triage tools demonstrated relatively high rates of under triage.

Key points
- Go inside if you hear thunder or see lightning.
- If someone was struck by lightning, call for help, assess the situation, respond, and resuscitate.
- Learn indoor and outdoor safety tips to protect yourself and your loved ones from lightning. Avoid windows, doors, porches, and concrete.
- Stay away from windows and doors, and stay off porches.
- Do NOT lie on concrete floors or lean on concrete walls during a thunderstorm. Lightning can travel through any metal wires or bars in concrete walls or flooring. Don't use corded phones. Corded phones are NOT safe to use during a thunderstorm. Do NOT use them. However, it is safe to use cordless or cellular phones during a storm. Outdoors Although no place outside is safe during a thunderstorm, you can minimize your risk by assessing the lightning threat early and taking appropriate actions. The best defense is to avoid lightning. Here are some outdoor safety tips that can help you avoid being struck. Be aware.

Check the forecast. Thunderstorms with lightning in the mountains occur most often during the summer months, in the late afternoon or evening.
- Check the weather forecast before participating in outdoor activities.
- If the forecast calls for thunderstorms, postpone your trip or activity, or make sure suitable safe shelter is readily available. Watch and listen for distant storm activity.
- Watch for distant lightning and listen for distant thunder. You might hear thunder before you see lightning on a bright day.
- If you hear thunder or see lightning, seek shelter away from the water. When thunder roars, go indoors. Remember the phrase, "When thunder roars, go indoors. "
- Find a safe, enclosed shelter when you hear thunder. Even if you see blue sky, you could still be in danger.
- Don't resume outdoor activities for at least 30 minutes after the storm. The beginning and the end of a storm are the most dangerous times.
- If you hear thunder while you are at the beach, find a safe, enclosed shelter, such as your car. Do NOT seek shelter under beach picnic shelters. Avoid open spaces, vehicles, or structures.
- Stay away from open spaces such as golf courses, parks, playgrounds, ponds, lakes, swimming pools, and beaches.
- Avoid open vehicles such as convertibles, motorcycles, and golf carts.
- Avoid open structures such as porches, gazebos, baseball dugouts, and sports arenas. These structures won't protect you from lightning. Seek shelter immediately, even if caught out in the open. If you are caught in an open area, act quickly to find shelter. The most important action is to remove yourself from danger. Crouching or getting low to the ground can reduce your chances of being struck, but it does not remove you from danger. If you are caught outside with no safe shelter nearby:

- Immediately get off elevated areas such as hills, mountain ridges, or peaks.
- Never lie flat on the ground.

Crouch down in a ball-like position with your head tucked and hands over your ears so that you are down low with minimal contact with the ground.
- Never shelter under an isolated tree. If you are in a forest, shelter near lower trees.
- Never use a cliff or rocky overhang for shelter.
- Immediately get out of and away from ponds, lakes, and other bodies of water.
- Stay away from objects that conduct electricity. If you are out in the open water and a storm rolls in, return to shore immediately.
- If you are on a boat in open water when a thunderstorm rolls in, return to shore immediately and seek shelter. Once on land, get at least 100 yards away from shore.
- If you are unable to return to shore, boats with cabins offer some protection. When inside the cabin during a lightning storm, stay away from all metal and electrical components, including the radio, unless it is an emergency.

Lightning/Lightning strike injury — presentation and assessment emphasize that lightning strikes may happen in a variety of environmental conditions, most commonly occur in outdoor or wilderness circumstances, and that golf courses, exposed mountains or ledges and farms/fields present conditions that increase risk of lightning strike when hazardous meteorological conditions exist. Lacking bystander observations or history, it is not always immediately apparent that patient has been the victim of a lightning strike, and subtle findings such as injury patterns might suggest lightning injury; assessment covers respiratory (apnea, agonal respirations, respiratory paralysis), cardiovascular (dysrhythmias, transient hypertension), and neurologic (seizures, confusion, paralysis, paraplegia, vertigo/dizziness, paresthesias, amnesia, memory deficits) features.

### European burns association guidelines for the management of burn mass casualty incidents within a European response plan [^20538fa7]. Burns (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A European response plan to burn mass casualty incidents has been jointly developed by the European Commission and the European Burn Association. Upon request for assistance by an affected country, the plan outlines a mechanism for coordinated international assistance, aiming to alleviate the burden of care in the affected country and to offer adequate specialized care to all patients who can benefit from it. To that aim, Burn Assessment Teams are deployed to assess and triage patients. Their transportation priority recommendations are used to distribute outnumbering burn casualties to foreign burn centers. Following an appropriate medical evacuation, these casualties receive specialized care in those facilities.

Methods

The European Burns Association's disaster committee developed medical-organizational guidelines to support this European plan. The experts identified fields of interest, defined questions to be addressed, performed relevant literature searches, and added their expertise in burn disaster preparedness and response. Due to the lack of high-level evidence in the available literature, recommendations and specially designed implementation tools were provided from expert opinion. The European Burns Association officially endorsed the draft recommendations in 2019, and the final full text was approved by the EBA executive committee in 2022.

Recommendations

The resulting 46 recommendations address four fields. Field 1 underlines the need for national preparedness plans and the necessary core items within such plans, including coordination and integration with an international response. Field 2 describes Burn Assessment Teams' roles, composition, training requirements, and reporting goals. Field 3 addresses the goals of specialized in-hospital triage, appropriate severity criteria, and their effects on priorities and triage. Finally, field 4 covers medical evacuations, including their timing and organization, the composition of evacuation teams and their assets, preparation, and the principles of en route care.

### Lightning injuries [^67129c14]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Lightning is persistently one of the leading causes of death caused by environmental or natural disaster. To understand the pathophysiology and treatment of lightning injuries one must first discount the innumerable myths, superstitions, and misconceptions surrounding lightning. The fundamental difference between high voltage electrical injury and lightning is the duration of exposure to current. Reverse triage should be instituted in lightning strike victims because victims in cardiopulmonary arrest might gain the greatest benefit from resuscitation efforts, although there is no good evidence suggesting that lightning strike victims might benefit from longer than usual resuscitation times. Many of the injuries suffered by lightning strike victims are unique to lightning, and long-term sequelae should be anticipated and addressed in the lightning victim.

Mass casualty explosive event triage planning — Develop a color-coded patient (LSI = Life Saving Intervention) prioritization protocol: red (immediate), yellow (delayed), green (minimal), grey (expectant), and black (deceased). Consider lifesaving interventions for each patient when equipment is readily available, intervention is within provider's scope of practice, procedure can be quickly performed, and continuing post-procedure care does not require provider's presence at bedside. Reserve the use of imaging and lab testing for clinical conditions based on flexible triage protocols, and reduce provider documentation and other administrative responsibilities.

Resuscitation (2005). Low credibility.

Lightning is a hazard during outdoor activities, especially for hikers and mountaineers. Specific preventive measures include staying off ridges and summits, and away from single trees. If possible, stay close to a wall but keeping a distance of at least 1m away from the wall. All metal objects (carabiners, crampons, ice-axe, ski poles, etc.) should be removed and stored away safely. Lightning currents can follow wet ropes. To prevent blunt trauma the helmet should not be removed. Move as quickly as possible away from wire ropes and iron ladders. The crouch position should be adopted immediately if there is a sensation of hair "standing on end". Crackling noises or a visible glow indicate an imminent lightning strike. Rescue of lightning victims may be hazardous. Airborne helicopters can be struck by lightning with disastrous effects. It is prudent to wait until the danger of further strikes has passed. Treatment of lightning victims is based upon the ABCs - (Assessment) airway, breathing and circulation. Victims who are not breathing can often be resuscitated and should be helped first. Respiratory arrest may be prolonged, but the prognosis can be excellent if breathing is supported. Standard Advanced Life Support (ALS), if necessary, should be given at the scene.

On average, lightning causes more casualties annually in the United States than any other storm-related phenomenon except floods. Although 90% of those injured survive, they may have permanent sequelae and disability. Many of these people incur injuries or are killed by lightning because of misinformation and inappropriate behavior during thunderstorms. A few simple precautions can reduce lightning injury risk. To standardize recommended actions during thunderstorms, the Lightning Safety Group (LSG), composed of lightning experts from many lightning-related backgrounds, met at the American Meteorological Society meeting Phoenix, AZ, in January 1998 to collectively address personal lightning safety. This paper is a summary of the recommendations developed by the LSG.

### Introduction and executive summary: care of the critically ill and injured during pandemics and disasters: CHEST consensus statement [^5be6d02d]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Natural disasters, industrial accidents, terrorism attacks, and pandemics all have the capacity to result in large numbers of critically ill or injured patients. This supplement provides suggestions for all of those involved in a disaster or pandemic with multiple critically ill patients, including front-line clinicians, hospital administrators, professional societies, and public health or government officials. The current Task Force included a total of 100 participants from nine countries, comprised of clinicians and experts from a wide variety of disciplines. Comprehensive literature searches were conducted to identify studies upon which evidence-based recommendations could be made. No studies of sufficient quality were identified. Therefore, the panel developed expert-opinion-based suggestions that are presented in this supplement using a modified Delphi process. The ultimate aim of the supplement is to expand the focus beyond the walls of ICUs to provide recommendations for the management of all critically ill or injured adults and children resulting from a pandemic or disaster wherever that care may be provided. Considerations for the management of critically ill patients include clinical priorities and logistics (supplies, evacuation, and triage) as well as the key enablers (systems planning, business continuity, legal framework, and ethical considerations) that facilitate the provision of this care. The supplement also aims to illustrate how the concepts of mass critical care are integrated across the spectrum of surge events from conventional through contingency to crisis standards of care.

### Context-appropriate clinical practice guidelines for the care of explosive ordnance casualties in low-resource settings [^8cfc7729]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Between 2022 and 2024, civilian fatalities from explosive weapons (EW) increased by 122%, attributable to the extensive use of EW in conflicts globally, including Ukraine, Gaza, Syria, Sudan, and others less publicized such as the Sahel. EW are indiscriminate by nature. In conflicts characterized by their use, the majority of casualties are civilian. The protracted nature of modern armed conflict, increasing complexity in involvement of nonstate armed groups, and disregard for international humanitarian law in combination with the use of EW in populated areas severely strains local healthcare infrastructure, limiting the quality of timely trauma care for local casualties. Illustrating this disparity, the mortality rate among civilian victims of EW is approximately 38%, which is several times higher than that observed in high‐resource trauma systems.

Trauma care advances in high‐resource systems (military or civilian) have not yet systematically reached care practices in low‐resource conflict settings (LRCS). Among these advances are Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs), which have been described as the "backbone" of the Joint Trauma System (JTS) performance improvement program. The JTS, under the US Department of Defense (DoD), aims to reduce variability in trauma care practice through developing and implementing CPGs system‐wide, with topics ranging from antibiotics to drowning management. Targeted toward deployed military medical professionals caring for injured service members, CPGs have since often been used in civilian care; the DoD itself recognized that "standards and recommendations have found their way into the civilian medical communities".

Depending on medical rules of engagement at a given military treatment facility (MTF), civilian casualties may receive care at high‐resource MTFs within the JTS. However, most local casualties receive care locally, for example, in public health facilities. JTS CPGs may not be optimally suited for local casualty care in these lower‐resourced environments. Potential issues include:
The CPG development process and author teams being exclusively from high‐resource militaries
The demographic differences between civilian and military casualties
Differences in resources available to humanitarian versus military healthcare professionals, including limited evacuation abilities

### Recommendations for burns care in mass casualty incidents: WHO emergency medical teams technical working group on burns (WHO TWGB) 2017–2020 [^ccea21fc]. Burns (2021). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 7

On scene: in the event of a MCI, oral fluid should be encouraged (as appropriate) on-scene. Burn injured patients should not routinely receive intravenous burn resuscitation fluid at the scene.

TWGB experts reflected on their own extensive experiences from managing multiple burns patients (a recent example being drawn from the Senegalese burn speciality team responding to the oil tanker crash in Democratic Republic of Congo) and concluded that intravenous fluid replacement therapy for burns victims should not be delivered on scene but once further clinical assessment of the patient has been undertaken at the first receiving hospital. A number of points were highlighted:

- There are likely to be multiple, competing demands for first responders time on scene of a MCI. The accuracy of administration of intravenous fluid may easily be overlooked (for example ensuring an appropriate volume of fluid is titrated via a drip) and the attention to detail lacking. The risk of administering an inappropriate volume of intravenous fluid to a patient is thus high and the resultant fluid related complications increased. This would be particularly hazardous in the pre-hospital environment to all patients but particularly those sustaining inhalational injuries.
- If extended delays in transporting the patient from the scene to a health facility are likely however fluids may be considered, including judicious intravenous fluids using the formulas suggested in Recommendation 8a in cases of > 40% TBSA. The risks of fluid creep and other complications from over resuscitation by intravenous fluid must be considered and mitigated for, especially as a consequence of an overestimated TBSA.
- In patients with concurrent trauma injuries, on scene intravenous fluids should be considered on a case-by-case basis as per standard trauma protocols according to type of injury, injury severity and the clinical status of the patient.
- Concerns were raised in the survey from the wider burn community regarding the risk of organ hypo-perfusion and subsequent complications when on-scene intravenous fluids are not given. These concerns are justified. However, field experiences following mass casualty burn incidents have supported the TWGB consensus that on-scene fluid resuscitation for burn injury is not only impractical in this setting, but that its individual and collective risk/benefit ratio is likely to be unfavourable. This is mostly due to the loss of efficiency brought by implementing any complex intervention on-scene, to the difficulty of managing potential complications of overly active fluid resuscitation, and to the high probability of such over resuscitation related to aforementioned inaccuracy of on-scene TBSA assessment.
- Logistically the sheer volume and weight of intravenous fluid that would need to be transported by first responders or brought to scene if intravenous fluids were instigated during this phase is highly impractical. If intravenous fluid is provided per 'normal regime' (such as modified Parkland Formula, 2 mL/kg/%TBSA in the first 8 h) in the pre-hospital phase to 50 patients with an average 40% TBSA and an average 70 kg body weight, the estimated overall weight of transporting the estimated fluid volume is around 280 kg for 8 h.

Behavioral strategies for lightning risk reduction — in wilderness and general settings, "No place is absolutely safe from lightning". "When thunder roars, go indoors" is the currently recommended safety maxim of the National Weather Service. "If one can hear thunder, then there is a risk of lightning strikes and one should seek shelter immediately", and in wilderness settings individuals should "avoid or leave areas that are high risk for lightning strikes, such as ridgelines or summits", avoid "tall objects such as ski lifts, cell phone towers, or isolated trees", and observe for "building cumulonimbus clouds, increasing winds, and darkening skies". The guideline notes, "Previous rules have relied on timing lightning flashes with thunder to estimate distance from an approaching storm", and directs that "Individuals should instead rely on observing signs of impending storms and seeking cover accordingly". "Individuals should wait a minimum of 30 minutes after hearing the last thunderclap before resuming outdoor activity. Waiting 30 minutes should allow for the trailing edge of the thunderstorm to move the estimated 10 miles needed to establish an appropriate buffer zone. Recommendation grade: 1C".

Abstract

In 2023 the Committee for Tactical Emergency Casualty Care (C-TECC) issued updated Pediatric Tactical Emergency Casualty Care (TECC) Guidelines (Guidelines) that focus on the delivery of stabilizing care of children who are the victims of high-threat incidents such as an active shooter event. The Guidelines provide evidence-based and best practice recommendations to those individuals and departments that specifically provide operational medical support to law enforcement agencies caring for children in this uniquely dangerous environment where traditional resources may not be available. This article highlights key takeaway points from the Guidelines, including several updates since the first version was released in 2013. The evidence base for the care of children in this environment is lacking, and medical care delivered in the high-threat environment is inconsistent and often not optimized for the care of infants and children. The Guidelines are supported from the existing literature base where possible, and where it is not, by consensus as to the current best practices as determined by iterative deliberations among the diverse and experienced group of stakeholders who are members of C-TECC. The Guidelines provide patient assessment and management information specific to the care of children in the following 3 dynamic phases of the high-threat environment: Direct Threat, Indirect Threat, and Evacuation. The phases represent a continuum of risk to the patient and the responder ranging from extreme (such as ongoing gunfire) to minimal (during movement toward definitive medical care). The high-threat environment is dynamic and there is competing safety, tactical/operational, and patient care priorities for responders when infants and children are injured. The Guidelines provide recommendations on the type of medical and psychological care that should be considered under each phase of threat and establishes the context for how and why to deliver (or potentially defer) certain interventions under some circumstances in order the maximize the opportunity for a good outcome for an injured pediatric patient. The Guidelines also emphasize the importance of synergizing hospital-based pediatric trauma care with those law enforcement and fire/emergency medical services that may provide field care to children under high-threat circumstances.

### Interim planning guidance for preparedness and response to a mass casualty event resulting from terrorist use of explosives [^b786061d]. CDC (2010). Medium credibility.

Background and structure — terrorist explosive mass casualty events: A sudden and unpredictable bombing-related MCE requires an immediate response; disrupts communication systems; interrupts transportation of casualties, medical personnel, and supplies; and may overwhelm the capacity of responding agencies. The U.S. health care system has minimal experience in treating explosion-related injuries, and detonating devices in crowded public places results in complex, technically challenging injuries; deficiencies in response capability could result in increased morbidity and mortality. Explosions produce unique management challenges beginning with an immediate surge of patients, and large numbers arriving within a few hours may stress and limit emergency medical services (EMS) systems, hospitals, and other facilities caring for critically injured victims. Given the ongoing and increasing threat with decreasing emergency care capacity, proactively preparing is required, and health care and public health systems, individual hospitals, and health care personnel must collaborate to address the key challenges to "receive, evaluate, and treat large numbers of injured patients", "rapidly identify and stabilize the most critically injured", "evaluate response efforts", and "conduct exercises and strategic planning for future events".

Lightning injury — ear and audiovestibular effects include tympanic membrane (TM) rupture and transient sensorineural deafness, with TM rupture present in more than 60% in one case series (12 of 18 victims). Uncomplicated TM rupture usually heals spontaneously and can be managed conservatively, but otorrhea may signal basilar skull fracture, and current through the temporal bone can cause microhemorrhages and microfractures resulting in permanent hearing loss. Initial evaluation for TM integrity is necessary in all lightning strike victims, and follow-up with an otolaryngologist is essential for victims with hearing loss (Recommendation grade: 1C).

### Recommendations for burns care in mass casualty incidents: WHO emergency medical teams technical working group on burns (WHO TWGB) 2017–2020 [^4d07a5b9]. Burns (2021). Medium credibility.

Intravenous fluid

There are a number of recognised guidelines and formulae for fluid management in burns care, primarily focused on care of the individual burns patient. Little evidence however exists detailing the impact of minimal fluid administration in the early phase of response to a burn casualty and whether this would cause harm or be of benefit especially in the event of a MCI. A 2017 review identified that due to the challenges of austere environments fluid resuscitation can be delayed or restricted in burns up to 40% TBSA provided the patient is quickly transported to a treatment facility. The complications of aggressive fluid resuscitation however are well documented. In addition to clinical complications, logistical considerations should also be taken into account.

The recommendation detailed above suggests, when indicated, intravenous crystalloids (lactated Ringer, supplemented with dextrose in children) should be given at a volume and rate of 100mls/kg/24 h (TBSA > 40%). Burned surface area (%TBSA) however forms no part of the calculation unlike in other burn fluid formulae. This supports a more simplified yet fully individualised approach whereby fluid volume administered should be routinely adjusted in accordance with patient's clinical response and not adhered to in a strict formulaic manner.

If a patient needs a high volume of fluid due to deteriorating clinical course, early advanced airway intervention should be considered in conjunction with the increased resource need for on-going patient care.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prevention of drowning: 2019 update [^755c32ba]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Drowning — cessation of rescue and resuscitation: Based primarily on retrospective studies, submersion times of > 10 min appear to correlate with increased mortality or survival with severe neurologic dysfunction. Based on resources, it might be reasonable to cease rescue and resuscitation efforts when there is a known submersion time of greater than 30 min in water > 6°C (43°F), or greater than 90 min in water < 6°C (43°F), or after 25 min of continuous cardiopulmonary resuscitation. If at any point during search and rescue efforts the safety of the rescue team becomes threatened, rescue efforts should be ceased, and if resources are available and recovery team safety is maintained, body recovery efforts may continue beyond the search and rescue period with the understanding that resuscitation attempts will likely be futile. Recommendation Grade: 1C.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of lightning injuries: 2014 update [^56711b98]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Lightning position for imminent strikes — the lightning position involves sitting or crouching with knees and feet close together to create only one point of contact with the ground; if standing, have feet touching, and if sitting, lift feet off the ground; take this position only when a lightning strike is imminent and when all other lightning prevention strategies have failed, attempt to minimize ground current injury by insulating from the ground by sitting on a pack, a dry coiled rope, or a rolled foam sleeping pad; this is a strategy of last resort and should not be relied on as primary prevention but may reduce injury risk (Recommendation grade: 2C).

Mass casualty event victim tracking — coordinated data systems: In an MCE, hospitals are overwhelmed with a sudden influx of casualties and fatalities, and using a casualty tracking data system that is coordinated across all medical facilities is essential. The system should be capable of registering, documenting, and tracking victims to help make families' search for missing relatives as efficient as possible.

Involve the public — Community residents are often the first preventers of and responders to a mass casualty event (MCE), and they should be integrated into bombing terrorism preparedness and response. Planning a medical response to an MCE must be comprehensive and community based, and clear communication with the public is essential before, during, and after an MCE. Appropriate education and training efforts should include the public.

### Evaluating the tactical combat casualty care principles in civilian and military settings: systematic review, knowledge gap analysis and recommendations for future research [^252627bd]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) guidelines were developed in 1996 for the US Special Operations Forces to provide guidance for battlefield trauma care. Historic military medical data were reviewed and identified the most common and preventable causes of death on the battlefield: hemorrhaging extremity wounds, tension pneumothoraces and obstructed airways. Furthermore, the guidelines consider the added challenges of providing prehospital trauma care in an active military environment, such as delayed evacuation, poor visibility, and limited access to medical supplies. These factors inspired the five MARCH components within the TCCC guidelines: (1) massive hemorrhage control; (2) airway management; (3) respiratory management; (4) circulation; and (5) hypothermia prevention.

Interventions such as tourniquets, hemostatic dressings, cricothyrotomy, needle decompression, fluid/blood product administration, and thermal blankets have been assessed in austere environments to expand the TCCC guideline evidence base. This evidence base is reviewed monthly by the Committee on TCCC to identify MARCH interventions currently being used or any that with potential applicability to prehospital environments. While these interventions are regularly reviewed, the overall body of literature is infrequently evaluated. Gap analyses are scarce. In addition, a review conducted by Martin and colleagues highlighted gaps in battlefield casualty care research, including non-operative interventions for non-compressible truncal hemorrhage, the optimization of blood products and their storage, and factor concentrates and other alternative products for hemostatic resuscitation.

To our knowledge, no comprehensive knowledge synthesis describing the content and quality of current literature on the MARCH components of the TCCC guidelines has been performed. We sought to describe the current body of literature, evaluate its quality, identify gaps or potential limitations that exist within the TCCC guidelines, and offer recommendations for future research.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of lightning injuries: 2014 update [^43945100]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Lightning injuries — regional considerations highlight weather, geography, and situational risks: Lightning strikes are not uniformly distributed around the Earth, and thunderstorms are formed by 3 atmospheric elements: moisture, warm air on the surface of the earth, and a lifting wind. Geography influences incidence, with Central Africa having the greatest incidence of lightning strikes because of its mountainous terrain coupled with moist airflow from the Atlantic Ocean, leading to year-round thunderstorms; worldwide, rural populations have been at greatest risk, attributed to higher occupational exposure and limited access to substantial buildings for shelter. Though rare, lightning is possible even if the overlying sky is blue (so-called bolt from the blue) and can occur in sunny conditions after a storm, posing a risk to people who return to outdoor activity too soon; lightning is also possible in snowstorms, and graupel heralds weather favorable to lightning formation by generating the electrical gradient that facilitates lightning formation.

### Guidelines for burn care under austere conditions: introduction to burn disaster, airway and ventilator management, and fluid resuscitation [^501afb0d]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Mass casualty burn incidents — resource constraints from prior events indicate that items can be quickly depleted and ventilators scarce, necessitating triage of intubation and mechanical ventilation, with select providers conducting airway rounds; notably, the Pope Air Force Base crash in 1994 resulted in 119 burn casualties, and a larger scale disaster (> 1000 burn casualties) may involve different unforeseen problems.

### Tactical combat casualty care and wilderness medicine: advancing trauma care in austere environments [^5b5dd47b]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) is a set of evidence-based, best-practice prehospital trauma care guidelines customized for use on the battlefield. Military units that have trained all of their unit members in TCCC have now documented the lowest incidence of preventable deaths in the history of modern warfare and TCCC is now the standard for battlefield trauma care in the US Military. TCCC and wilderness medicine share the goal of optimizing care for patients with trauma in austere environments that impose significant challenges in both equipment and evacuation capability. This article reviews the current battlefield trauma care recommendations in TCCC and discusses their applicability to the wilderness setting.

### Resuscitation resequenced: a rational approach to patients with trauma in shock [^7168ba3c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Trauma resuscitation is a complex and dynamic process that requires a high-performing team to optimize patient outcomes. More than 30 years ago, Advanced Trauma Life Support was developed to formalize and standardize trauma care; however, the sequential nature of the algorithm that is used can lead to ineffective prioritization. An improved understanding of shock mandates an updated approach to trauma resuscitation. This article proposes a resequenced approach that (1) addresses immediate threats to life and (2) targets strategies for the diagnosis and management of shock causes. This updated approach emphasizes evidence-based resuscitation principles that align with physiologic priorities.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of lightning injuries: 2014 update [^ccbc49f8]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for lightning injury, more specifically with respect to thunderstorm safety, WMS 2014 guidelines recommend to advise seeking a sheltered area inside a deep cave, far into a dense forest, or in a deep ravine in the wilderness setting as these features represent a safer alternative than remaining in an open, exposed area. Avoid using shallow caves, solitary trees, or open shelters (such as a picnic shelter, dugout, canopy, or lean-to) because of the risk of side splash and ground current. Recognize that tents do not provide adequate protection from lightning. Use buildings followed by a hardtop vehicle, when possible, as the safest shelter.

### Guidelines for field triage of injured patients: recommendations of the national expert panel on field triage, 2011 [^dfa28167]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Field triage of injured patients — literature search and article selection methods are summarized: Published peer-reviewed research was the primary basis for revisions, with a Medline search of English language peer-reviewed articles published between January 1, 2006 and May 1, 2011 using multiple terms (e.g., "trauma", "injury", "pre-hospital", "emergency medical services", "ambulance", "transport", "triage"). Both strategies excluded case reports, editorials, review articles, non-English publications, and disaster/terrorism content. A total of 2,052 articles (389 on overall field triage and 1,663 step-specific) were identified; four panel members rated abstracts as "include" or "exclude", and articles were included if two or more researchers selected them. Agreement among raters was k = 0.73 with standard deviation = 0.009. This yielded a total of 241 unique articles, and a March 2011 working group identified an additional 48 articles; together with the originally identified 241 articles, these were provided to the Panel for review.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prevention of drowning: 2024 update [^9e42c90a]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Drowning resuscitation — airway and ventilation priorities: Supplying oxygen to the brain is critical to successful resuscitation; we recommend establishing an airway and providing oxygen as priorities in initial resuscitation. For the patient in cardiac arrest, we recommend positive pressure ventilation in addition to chest compressions using the traditional Airway Breathing Circulation model of resuscitation. If an advanced airway is available and properly placed, provide breaths at specified time intervals (every 6 to 8 s) while continuous compressions are administered. For laypeople without training in rescue breathing, we recommend compression-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) over no intervention. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### National guideline for the field triage of injured patients: recommendations of the national expert panel on field triage, 2021 [^700d31b7]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The 2021 field triage guideline is based on the most current science, a national panel of interdisciplinary experts, direct feedback from EMS clinicians, and input from many stakeholders. This guideline presents an opportunity to improve the prehospital care of injured patients across the United States. Effective field triage is foundational to trauma systems, concentrating the most seriously injured patients in trauma centers to improve survival after injury.

Regarding preventative measures for lightning injury, more specifically with respect to thunderstorm safety, WMS 2014 guidelines recommend to advise swimmers exiting the water and seeking shelter expeditiously if caught swimming during a lightning storm. Advise moving to shore and away from the water's edge as soon as possible when rafting or kayaking. Advise seeking shelter below deck after locking off the helm when boating. Advise tying into a lifeline if no shelter is available below.

### Interim planning guidance for preparedness and response to a mass casualty event resulting from terrorist use of explosives [^756563f4]. CDC (2010). Medium credibility.

Executive summary — terrorist use of explosives (TUE) mass casualty events: Explosive devices are the most common weapons used by terrorists, and explosions can produce instantaneous havoc with numerous patients and complex, technically challenging injuries not commonly seen after natural disasters. Many patients self-evacuate after a terrorist attack, making prehospital care difficult to coordinate and leading hospitals near the scene to expect a large influx, or surge, of patients after a terrorist strike. The threat of terrorism occurs as hospitals and emergency health care systems are stressed and face enormous challenges, and with the occurrence of a mass casualty event (MCE) health systems would be expected to confront issues in organization and leadership, personnel, infrastructure and capacity, communication, triage and transportation, logistics, and legal and ethical challenges. The purpose of this interim guidance is to provide information and insight to assist public policy and health system leaders in preparing for and responding to an MCE caused by TUE, and it focuses on leadership in preparing for and responding to a TUE event and effective care of patients in the prehospital and hospital environments during a TUE event.

Part 7: Training

Recommendation 18

All BRRT and BST personnel should have completed generic EMT training and safety and security training (either as part of an EMT training or separately) prior to being eligible to join a burns team. In particular, all members should complete training focusing on adaptation of clinical care according to context - including in resource-limited settings - and team focused training. Successful completion of this training is recommended as a pre-requisite for selection to a BRRT or BST.

Additional specific training for BRRTs and BSTs should include:

- Assessment, co-ordination and leadership in MCIs with burn injuries.
- Clinical care including resuscitation and safe burn patient transfer.
- Decision making regarding the management of multiple burn patients.
- Local and national co-ordination mechanisms and patient transfers.
- Surge capacity management.
- 'Lesson Learnt' from burn MCIs.

The target audience for burns specialist training are practising clinicians and members of local co-ordination systems (for example personnel from the H-EOC).

Recommendation 19

All burns team personnel should complete specialised training in burns care specifically focusing on MCI, whilst team leaders and clinicians should also have training in coordination and emergency management.

Globally, utilisation should be made of existing courses which meet the expected learning outcomes, ensuring training is regionally accessible, open access and economically viable.

Personnel with the relevant burns and training experience are encouraged to provide a mentorship role to emerging teams and support delivery of training as expert faculty.

Training should encompass a blended modular approach to learning and knowledge acquisition (for example workshop-based activities, immersive simulation, classroom based sessions). Consideration should also be given to supporting community education programmes around on scene first responder burn care. Training for teams in low resource contexts should be sensitive and responsive to local and cultural needs, relevant to the type of healthcare professional working with burns patients and tailored to meet the basic, intermediate and advanced levels of burn care.

The WHO EMT Toolkit will provide an open access virtual platform for supporting curriculum material and training guidance.
- Guidance on EMT training curriculum, content and delivery can be accessed via the virtual EMT Toolkit.
- Guidance on a standardised mass casualty burn response curriculum, course content and delivery of specific training will be available via the virtual EMT toolkit.
- Training for BRRTs is recommended to be delivered at a national level.
- Training specific for BSTs can be delivered centrally at a regional level.

### Response to mass casualty events: from the battlefield to the stop the bleed campaign [^85660877]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2016). Low credibility.

Summary

As tragic as all these mass casualty events truly are, we must not lose sight of the need to thoroughly examine each one for lessons learned (and relearned) in order to continuously prepare for the next one. Partnering with our military colleagues in the new Military Trauma Care's Learning Health System will assure exchange of information and forge ahead a research program designed to improve the care of all who are involved in disasters and mass casualty events. Great lessons have already been learned but more are still to be taught. Adequate trauma research funding by governmental agencies, the military sector, and private industry should become a priority at a time when trauma has claimed so many lives and is unfortunately destined to claim more. Educating, equipping, and then empowering the public could save additional lives similar to the introduction of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Failure to take action at this time in our history would be the biggest tragedy of all.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of lightning injuries: 2014 update [^ebac7356]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Lightning injury mechanisms — classification, relative frequency, and tissue resistance are described as follows: Lightning injuries are classified as direct strike, contact injury, side splash, or ground current, with direct strikes "accounting for approximately 5% of lightning strikes involving people", side splash "accounts for one-third of lightning injuries", and ground current "accounts for nearly half of lightning injuries". Lightning electricity travels the path of least resistance, and in body tissues the order of least to greatest resistance is "nerve < blood < muscle < skin < fat < bone". A fifth mechanism, the "upward streamer", "describes current passing up from the ground, through the victim, without a nearby ground strike" and "does not become part of a completed lightning channel".
