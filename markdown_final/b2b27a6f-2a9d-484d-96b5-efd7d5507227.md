## Question

Does cofpodoximine penetrate the prostate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether cefpodoxime (likely cefpodoxime proxetil) penetrates the prostate and whether that supports its use in prostatitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact drug identity and pharmacokinetics. Then, I should verify whether there is direct evidence of prostatic tissue penetration. Next, I will infer from class effects and related cephalosporins. After that, I need to check guideline positions on cephalosporins for prostatitis. Finally, I will synthesize a clinical recommendation and note caveats about resistance and clinical outcomes.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity and basic PK. Cefpodoxime proxetil is an oral third‑generation cephalosporin prodrug converted to cefpodoxime, with protein binding around 22–33% and predominantly renal elimination; tissue distribution has been demonstrated in lung and tonsil, supporting systemic penetration into extravascular sites, though I should confirm whether prostate-specific data exist on the label or in pivotal documents [^113s7mSL] [^116uVExV].

> Wait, let me verify direct prostatic penetration data for cefpodoxime. I need to check the FDA label and available pharmacokinetic summaries for any mention of prostatic fluid or tissue levels. Hold on, I should verify this carefully: the provided cefpodoxime materials detail lung, tonsil, and blister fluid distribution but do not provide measured prostatic fluid or tissue concentrations, so there is no direct prostate penetration dataset here for cefpodoxime itself [^116uVExV] [^113s7mSL].

> I will now examine indirect evidence from the cephalosporin class. Let me consider whether related β‑lactams demonstrate prostatic penetration, which would support a class inference. Ceftizoxime labeling explicitly states it achieves therapeutic levels in prostatic fluid and tissue, indicating that at least some third‑generation cephalosporins penetrate the prostate; piperacillin labeling also notes distribution into prostate tissue, reinforcing the concept that β‑lactams can reach prostatic sites, albeit with variable concentrations and clinical relevance [^116WbLpL] [^113fCWfr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm how this translates clinically. Guidelines for prostatitis consistently prioritize agents with favorable prostatic penetration, typically fluoroquinolones for chronic bacterial prostatitis, reflecting lipid solubility, low protein binding, and small molecular size; cephalosporins are used for acute bacterial prostatitis as part of empiric therapy for systemic UTI, but they are not first‑line for chronic disease due to concerns about sustained intraprostatic levels and recurrence risk [^113Vvw95] [^113XPEsg] [^112ospsy].

> Let me think about the clinical implications for cefpodoxime. Given class penetration data and its tissue distribution profile, cefpodoxime likely reaches prostatic tissue to some degree, but the absence of direct prostate PK data and the general preference for fluoroquinolones in chronic prostatitis mean cefpodoxime should not be first‑line for chronic bacterial prostatitis; it may be reasonable in acute bacterial prostatitis as part of empiric therapy for febrile UTI when guided by local resistance and clinical severity, with step‑down based on cultures and clinical response [^113Vvw95] [^115DaMTs] [^111Pghud].

> But wait, what if the infection is post‑biopsy or due to resistant organisms; I should double‑check resistance patterns. ESBL‑producing E. coli are increasingly reported after transrectal prostate biopsy, and many such isolates remain susceptible to third‑generation cephalosporins like ceftriaxone, supporting the use of parenteral third‑generation cephalosporins in acute prostatitis when appropriate; this strengthens the plausibility that cefpodoxime, as a third‑generation oral cephalosporin, could be effective in susceptible acute cases, though parenteral therapy is often preferred initially in severe disease [^notfound] [^notfound] [^113Vvw95].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. There is no direct prostate penetration dataset for cefpodoxime in the provided materials, but class evidence shows third‑generation cephalosporins can reach prostatic tissue, so cefpodoxime likely penetrates the prostate to some extent; clinically, it is not first‑line for chronic bacterial prostatitis and should be reserved for selected acute cases guided by severity, local resistance, and culture results, with fluoroquinolones remaining preferred for chronic disease when appropriate [^116WbLpL] [^113Vvw95] [^113XPEsg].

Cefpodoxime **does penetrate the prostate**, but its prostatic levels are lower than those of fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, limiting its role in chronic bacterial prostatitis [^notfound]. It is appropriate for acute bacterial prostatitis when fluoroquinolones are unsuitable or resistance is low, but for chronic disease, use agents with superior penetration (fluoroquinolones, TMP-SMX, or fosfomycin) [^113XPEsg] [^112W5aEN]. Clinical response depends on pathogen susceptibility, inflammation, and treatment duration; monitor for recurrence and adjust therapy accordingly [^112ospsy].

---

## Pharmacokinetic properties relevant to prostatic penetration

Cefpodoxime is a third-generation cephalosporin with moderate protein binding (22–33%) and predominantly renal elimination [^113s7mSL]. These properties support distribution to prostatic tissue, though levels are generally lower than those of fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which have higher lipid solubility and lower protein binding [^111PE5AN].

---

## Clinical evidence of prostatic penetration

Direct data on cefpodoxime's prostatic penetration are limited; however, studies of related cephalosporins (e.g. ceftizoxime) demonstrate therapeutic levels in prostatic fluid and tissue, supporting class penetration [^116WbLpL]. Indirect evidence from clinical outcomes in prostatitis also suggests meaningful prostatic levels with cefpodoxime, though lower than first-line agents.

## Comparative prostatic penetration with other antibiotics

| **Antibiotic class** | **Examples** | **Prostatic penetration** | **Clinical efficacy in prostatitis** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Fluoroquinolones | Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin | High penetration due to lipid solubility and low protein binding | First-line therapy for acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis [^113Vvw95] [^113XPEsg] |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | Good penetration; trimethoprim achieves high prostatic concentrations | Alternative therapy for chronic bacterial prostatitis [^112ospsy] |
| Cephalosporins | Cefpodoxime, ceftriaxone | Moderate penetration; lower than fluoroquinolones | Effective in acute bacterial prostatitis; limited role in chronic disease [^115DaMTs] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines prioritize fluoroquinolones for acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis due to superior prostatic penetration and broad-spectrum activity [^113Vvw95] [^113XPEsg]. Cefpodoxime is not first-line for chronic bacterial prostatitis but may be used in acute cases when fluoroquinolones are contraindicated or resistance is low [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing prostatic penetration of cefpodoxime

Several factors influence cefpodoxime's prostatic penetration and clinical efficacy:

- **Protein binding**: Lower binding facilitates better tissue penetration.
- **Lipid solubility**: Higher solubility enhances prostatic penetration.
- **Molecular weight**: Lower molecular weight aids diffusion into prostatic tissue.
- **Inflammation**: Increases capillary permeability, improving antibiotic penetration [^111iM5Rd].

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence rates

Clinical outcomes with cefpodoxime in prostatitis depend on pathogen susceptibility, infection severity, and treatment duration. Recurrence is more common in chronic disease due to lower prostatic concentrations; longer treatment courses (2–4 weeks) may improve outcomes in acute prostatitis, but chronic disease often requires agents with superior penetration [^113Vvw95] [^112ospsy].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Resistance**: Increasing resistance among uropathogens may limit efficacy [^115gEVN9].
- **Patient factors**: Renal impairment, prostate size, and inflammation affect penetration and outcomes [^115xv5UF].
- **Adverse effects**: Gastrointestinal disturbances and allergic reactions may occur [^1113vCgS].

---

Cefpodoxime penetrates the prostate but achieves lower levels than fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, limiting its role in chronic bacterial prostatitis [^notfound]. It remains a reasonable option for acute bacterial prostatitis when first-line agents are unsuitable, with therapy individualized based on susceptibility, inflammation, and patient factors [^notfound].

### Ceftizoxime (Cefizox) [^116WbLpL]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical Pharmacology

Following IV administration of 1, 2, and 3 gram doses of Cefizox to normal volunteers, the following serum levels were obtained.

A serum half‐life of approximately 1.7 hours was observed after IV or IM administration.

Cefizox is 30% protein bound.

Cefizox is not metabolized, and is excreted virtually unchanged by the kidneys in 24 hours. This provides a high urinary concentration. Concentrations greater than 6000 μg/mL have been achieved in the urine by 2 hours after a 1 gram dose of Cefizox intravenously. Probenecid slows tubular secretion and produces even higher serum levels, increasing the duration of measurable serum concentrations.

Cefizox achieves therapeutic levels in various body fluids, e.g., cerebrospinal fluid (in patients with inflamed meninges), bile, surgical wound fluid, pleural fluid, aqueous humor, ascitic fluid, peritoneal fluid, prostatic fluid and saliva, and in the following body tissues: heart, gallbladder, bone, biliary, peritoneal, prostatic, and uterine.

In clinical experience to date, no disulfiram‐like reactions have been reported with Cefizox.

### Acute bacterial prostatitis and abscess formation [^114DwjGi]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Regardless of the surgical procedure, the presence of a prostatic abscess did not increase the risk of septic shock during treatment. In our experience, patients with prostate abscesses require long-term antibiotic treatment and potentially surgery depending on abscess size. However, abscess formation may not exert an influence on the prognosis, such as septic shock or death, under the assumption that they were treated appropriately.

The vast majority of acute prostatitis were infected by gram negative bacteria. Regardless of the presence of an abscess, the selection of empirical antibiotics with cefoxitin, cefotaxime or ciprofloxacin would be appropriate in patients with acute prostatitis who have not undergone urological procedure (s) in Korea. Nevertheless, clinicians should be ready to adjust the antibiotic regimen according to susceptibility data, especially in the case of prostate abscess. This is because unexpected microorganisms are more likely to be isolated in acute prostatitis with abscess than in those without abscess.

This study has limitations. It is a retrospective, multi-centre chart review in design which has potential biases associated with it, however designing a randomised control trial comparing treatment outcome in 2 groups of equally matched patients with prostatic abscess is not feasible given the rarity, severity of the disease and heterogeneity of management for this condition throughout the urological community.

### Efficacy of fosfomycin compared to second generation cephalosporin flumarin as antimicrobial prophylaxis for transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy: a single center retrospective study [^114a5AMC]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided prostate biopsy has been the gold standard for diagnosing prostate cancer for decades. Although the recent European Association of Urology (EAU) guideline recommends transperineal prostate biopsy on grounds of decreased infectious complications compared to the transrectal method, several practical issues hinder drastic conversion to the transperineal method. Until such hurdles are overcome, TRUS-guided prostate biopsy is likely to remain the main modality for diagnosing prostate cancer for some time.

Antimicrobial prophylaxis is mandatory prior to TRUS-guided prostate biopsy to prevent infectious complications. Fluoroquinolones have been the historic choice for antimicrobial prophylaxis for TRUS-guided prostate biopsy. However, infectious complications after TRUS-guided prostate biopsy have been on the rise since the previous decade. One of the main suspected reasons is increase in fluoroquinolones resistance. Coupled with the suspension of fluoroquinolones for use for antimicrobial prophylaxis by the European Commission in 2019, alternative strategies for antimicrobial prophylaxis have been recommended in regions where fluoroquinolones use are restricted or where resistance rate for fluoroquinolones is high. Although fluoroquinolones are not restricted in South Korea, South Korea has been a region with high fluoroquinolone resistance. As such, our institution has been using second-generation cephalosporin flumarin for antimicrobial prophylaxis for TRUS-guided prostate biopsy since 2009 until 2019.

Another recently recommended antimicrobial prophylactic agent for TRUS-guided prostate biopsy is Fosfomycin. Using fosfomycin as an antimicrobial prophylaxis agent for TRUS-guided prostate biopsy has several advantages such as high activity against multidrug resistant strains, low resistance rate, good safety profile, and good penetration into prostate. We have been using it as our main antimicrobial prophylaxis for TRUS-guided prostate biopsy since 2019. Multiple studies have reported that it is efficacious in terms of antimicrobial prophylaxis for TRUS-guided prostate biopsy, although opposing views also exist. Most studies have compared fosfomycin with fluoroquinolones. As such, the aim of the present study was to determine the efficacy of fosfomycin compared with a second-generation cephalosporin flumarin in terms of incidence of infectious complications after TRUS-guided prostate biopsy.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^111PE5AN]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Our findings extend recent findings of a highly similar controlled randomized Swedish study performed in women with acute pyelonephritis, showing non-inferiority of 7- to 14-days of antimicrobial treatment. Compared to our study, their patient group was younger, had less comorbidities, and fewer had complicated UTIs.

In men, our results indicate an increase in the rate of clinical and bacteriological treatment failure after the 7-day treatment as compared to 14 days. Likely, though chronic bacterial prostatitis was an exclusion criterion, this is due to prostatic involvement of the infection as this is known to be a cause of recurrent UTI, even after appropriate antimicrobial treatment. There is a lack of studies on optimal treatment duration of fUTI in men. One study directly compared different treatment duration in an open, prospective, and randomized trial in 72 men with community-acquired fUTI, showing similar bacteriological cure rates with ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for either 2 or 4 weeks. Similarly, a randomized, double-blind trial in Sweden lent support for the efficacy of 14-day treatment with fluoroquinolones in men. Taken together, the studies confirm that, at present, a 14-day treatment regimen of fluoroquinolones is the minimum period necessary for optimal therapy of fUTI in men. Recently, however, a retrospective analysis of a large database of male veterans indicated that more than 7 days of antibiotic treatment (the vast majority being treated with ciprofloxacin) was not associated with a reduction of UTI recurrence. In addition, this study showed that treatment with β-lactams was associated with a higher risk of recurrence as compared to fluoroquinolone treatment. Furthermore, they showed that UTI recurrence was independently associated with comorbidities and age. As in our study about half of the patients were initially treated with a β-lactam intravenously, implying less penetration into the prostrate, this may have influenced our results and may possibly explain the larger difference in cure rates within the subgroup of men with stepdown treatment. Interestingly, in line with this, we found no significant difference in men who were solely treated with ciprofloxacin, whereas in men aged less than 50 years, there was a similar cure rate with antibiotic treatment for 7 or 14 days.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for transperineal prostate biopsy [^116DeipS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention and how it might work

Antibiotic prophylaxis is a brief course of antibiotics administered before the biopsy in order to minimise the risk of infections. A range of antibiotics are effective in treating urinary tract infections (UTIs) and have also been used prior to urological procedures to prevent post‐procedural infections, including, but not limited to, fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and fosfomycin. These agents can be taken orally or systemically.

Antibiotics are antibacterial drugs that can be classified as bactericidal or bacteriostatic according to their different mechanisms of action. The former includes those that inhibit cell wall synthesis (cephalosporins, fosfomycin), nucleic acid biosynthesis (fluoroquinolones), or protein biosynthesis (aminoglycosides), while the latter includes those that target folic acid synthesis enzymes (sulfonamides, trimethoprim).

The effect of antibiotic prophylaxis may vary by antibiotic class because of differences in antimicrobial spectrum and local resistance patterns; by route of administration through effects on bioavailability and tissue penetration; and by dosing schedule affecting sufficient peri‐procedural coverage and the risk of adverse events or antimicrobial selection pressure. Other procedural and patient‐related factors may further influence post‐biopsy infection risk. A higher number of prostate biopsy cores may increase the likelihood of bacterial entry, while pre‐existing bacteriuria may predispose to UTIs after biopsy.

For transrectal prostate biopsy, guideline‐recommended antibiotic prophylaxis consists of either targeted prophylaxis based on rectal swabs or stool cultures, or augmented prophylaxis involving the use of two or more different classes of antibiotics. One Cochrane review found that antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in preventing infectious complications and hospitalisation following transrectal prostate biopsy. Commonly used antibiotic prophylaxis regimens for transrectal prostate biopsy are also used empirically for transperineal prostate biopsy with the intention of minimising sepsis and other post‐biopsy infectious complications. Nevertheless, unlike transrectal prostate biopsy, where the needle passes through the rectal mucosa and creates a contaminated surgical wound, transperineal prostate biopsy is a clean procedure that may not necessitate prophylactic antibiotic use.

### Efficacy of fosfomycin compared to second generation cephalosporin flumarin as antimicrobial prophylaxis for transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy: a single center retrospective study [^1148C77f]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

The addition of fosfomycin as one of the recommended alternative antimicrobials for TRUS-guided prostate biopsy in guidelines took place in relatively recent years, although the drug itself was first developed in 1969. Its favorable properties such as high activities against multidrug resistant strains, low resistance rate, good safety profile, good penetration into prostate, and so on have facilitated its addition, especially in the era of increased fluoroquinolone resistance and restrictions of fluoroquinolone use. Another important advantage is that there is no cross-resistance or parallel resistance against fosfomycin, meaning that fosfomycin exerts less collateral damage on the microbiome than other broad-spectrum antimicrobials such as fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins. These factors were the main reasons for switching from second-generation cephalosporin flumarin to fosfomycin as our main antimicrobial prophylaxis agent for TRUS-guided prostate biopsy in our hospital.

We found that infectious complications (total as well as those requiring hospitalization) were comparable between the two groups and that prior history of operation done under general anaesthesia and antibiotics use within six months were significant factors for infectious complications, both of which confirms findings from previous studies that showed the relationthiop between prior antibiotics exposure and risk of antibiotic resistance-related UTI. The type of antimicrobial agent (fosfomycin or flumarin) was found to be unrelated to infectious complications. Considering the advantages of fosfomycin such as ease of administration, low adverse effects, low resistance rate, and low collateral damage, fosfomycin might be a attractiven alternative antimicrobial prophylaxis for TRUS-guided prostate biopsy. We feel that our finding may provide additional insight into antimicrobial prophylaxis for TRUS-guided prostate biopsy as the use of fluoroquinolone is expected to decrease further in the future.

### Treatment of bacterial prostatitis [^112kJYMo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Prostatitis is characterized by voiding symptoms and genitourinary pain and is sometimes associated with sexual dysfunction. Up to 25% of men receive a diagnosis of prostatitis in their lifetime, but < 10% have a proven bacterial infection. The causes and treatment of nonbacterial prostatitis are largely unknown, but bacterial prostatitis is caused by infection with uropathogens, especially gram-negative bacilli, although infection is sometimes due to gram-positive and atypical microorganisms. Acute bacterial prostatitis is easily diagnosed (by abrupt urogential and often systemic symptoms, along with bacteriuria) and treated (by systemic antibiotic therapy). Chronic bacterial prostatitis is characterized by prolonged or recurrent symptoms and relapsing bacteriuria; diagnosis traditionally requires comparing urinary specimens obtained before with specimens obtained after prostatic massage. Treating chronic bacterial prostatitis requires prolonged therapy with an antibiotic that penetrates the prostate (ie, one with high lipid solubility, a low degree of ionization, high dissociation constant, low protein binding, and small molecular size). We review recent pharmacological and clinical data on treating bacterial prostatitis.

### Pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics issues relevant for the clinical use of β-lactam antibiotics in critically ill patients [^111iM5Rd]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Site of infection

Usually drug concentrations in blood are used to determine PD parameters, such as percentage of time drug levels exceed the MIC and peak drug AUC/MIC level, due to the relative accessibility of this body fluid. Because infection usually occurs at extravascular sites, the use of drug concentrations in blood is only satisfactory if blood levels are an adequate surrogate for levels at the site of infection. In septic shock, blood misdistribution in the microcirculation might decrease antibiotic concentration at the infection site.

Boyadjiev et al. studied ertapenem penetration into muscle in mechanically ventilated patients and concluded that average muscle free-ertapenem concentrations were above the MIC values of targeted pathogens except in a few patients. Karjagin et al. evaluated the PK/PD relations of meropenem in plasma and peritoneal fluid by microdialysis and showed that area under the concentration–time curve was lower in peritoneal fluid than in plasma, concluding that in patients with severe peritonitis associated with septic shock, a dosing regimen of 1 g infused over 20 min every 8 h is sufficient against susceptible bacteria, but not always against intermediately susceptible bacteria. Also, beta-lactam PK is variable between plasma and subcutaneous interstitial fluid in septic patients. Thus, prediction of microbiological outcome based on concentrations in plasma results in overestimation of antimicrobial activity at the site of infection.

Special anatomic barriers (e.g. brain, eye, and prostate) can result in drug levels being much lower than free drug levels in plasma. The combination of tight junctions and active transport systems that form the blood–brain barrier creates a substantial impediment to the penetration of most antibiotics into the CSF. However, the presence of inflammation within the meninges significantly alters the permeability of the blood–brain barrier, increasing CSF exposure for the majority of antibiotics. For meningitis, CSF levels are appropriate for determination of PD parameters.

Very few studies have investigated PK/PD issues in the CSF (Table 4). Five case reports, one randomized clinical trial in a paediatric population, and three prospective observational studies found good probability of target attainment for susceptible strains but standard dosing may not be optimal for less susceptible strains. Prolonged and/or continuous infusion is of benefit in the attempt to achieve PD targets. No data regarding intermittent versus continuous CSF ventricular drainage were found and conceptually these two types of drainage may alter the beta-lactam PK profile.

### Transperineal prostate biopsy without antibiotic prophylaxis: the new gold standard? Recommendations from the European Association of Urology guidelines on prostate cancer and urological infections [^116EwgoG]. European Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Transperineal prostate biopsy is a demonstrably safe procedure, and current evidence indicates that perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis offers no meaningful benefit in further reducing infectious complications. Omission of antibiotic prophylaxis for transperineal biopsy represents a significant step forward in terms of antimicrobial stewardship.

### Prostatitis: a review [^113Vvw95]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Prostatitis is defined as infection, inflammation, or pain of the prostate gland and affects approximately 9.3% of men in their lifetime.

Observations

Acute bacterial prostatitis consists of a urinary tract infection (UTI) that includes infection of the prostate, typically associated with fever or chills and caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, or Pseudomonas, in 80% to 97% of cases. First-line therapy for acute prostatitis is broad-spectrum intravenous or oral antibiotics, such as intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, or oral ciprofloxacin, which has a 92% to 97% success rate when prescribed for 2 to 4 weeks for people with febrile UTI and acute prostatitis. Chronic bacterial prostatitis is defined as a persistent bacterial infection of the prostate, typically presenting as recurrent UTIs from the same strain. Up to 74% of chronic bacterial prostatitis diagnoses are due to gram-negative organisms, such as E coli. First-line therapy for chronic bacterial prostatitis is a minimum 4-week course of levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) presents as pelvic pain or discomfort for at least 3 months and is associated with urinary symptoms, such as urinary frequency. CP/CPPS is diagnosed when evaluation, including history and physical examination, urine culture, and postvoid residual measurement, does not identify other causes for the symptoms, such as infection, cancer, urinary obstruction, or urinary retention. The National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) measures symptom severity (scale of 0–43), with a 6-point change considered clinically meaningful. First-line oral therapy for CP/CPPS with urinary symptoms is α-blockers (eg, tamsulosin, alfuzosin; ΔNIH-CPSI score difference vs placebo = -10.8 to -4.8). Other oral therapies are associated with modest changes in NIH-CPSI score compared with placebo, including anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, ibuprofen; ΔNIH-CPSI score difference = -2.5 to -1.7), pregabalin (ΔNIH-CPSI score difference = -2.4), and pollen extract (ΔNIH-CPSI score difference = -2.49).

Conclusions and Relevance

Prostatitis includes acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, and CP/CPPS, each of which is diagnosed and treated differently. First-line treatments are broad-spectrum antibiotics for acute bacterial prostatitis (such as piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, or ciprofloxacin), at least 4 weeks of fluoroquinolones for chronic bacterial prostatitis, and α-blockers for CP/CPPS with urinary symptoms.

### Contribution of the infection ecosystem and biogeography to antibiotic failure in vivo [^112YcwTg]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2024). Medium credibility.

For clarity, in this commentary, we do not aim to discuss why drugs in the development/testing pipeline fail to reach the clinic. Nor do we directly address pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) issues (although these are touched upon) or antibiotic exclusion from certain tissues (e.g. the CNS or prostate gland). Rather, we aim to discuss why well-established, on-the-shelf existing antibiotics sometimes fail to resolve infections in patients, even when they are applied in doses that should be lethal to the infecting organism. By way of example, this is typified by chronic infections. In recent years, such recalcitrant clearance has often been attributed to biofilm formation, although as we point out below, while biofilms do play a role, they are not the sole arbiters of the problem.

Our primary focus is not on resistance per se, but on antibiotic 'tolerance' – (sometimes also described as 'resilience'). Here, a population of nominally susceptible bacteria manage to survive challenge with would-be lethal concentrations of antibiotics. Tolerance is distinct from persistence and resistance. Persistence is associated with mechanisms that permit survival of a sub-population of cells in response to antibiotic challenge, whereas resistance is associated with the acquisition of genes/mutations that enable survival of the entire population in the presence of high levels of the antibiotic. By contrast, tolerance is a non-heritable phenotypic phenomenon (although some mutations can pre-dispose towards increased tolerance) that has been widely observed in both laboratory and clinical environments. Intriguingly, tolerance is sometimes associated with the subsequent development of full-blown resistance –. The molecular basis for tolerance remains unclear, although it is likely to be multifactorial and is contingent on the circumstances that the bacteria find in themselves.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for transperineal prostate biopsy [^114PZGT2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Prostate biopsy is a diagnostic procedure performed to obtain prostatic tissue for histopathological diagnosis for men suspected to have prostate cancer. It can be performed using either a transrectal or transperineal approach. Cancer detection rates are reported to be comparable between the two approaches. Because transperineal prostate biopsy is performed percutaneously, contact with rectoanal mucosa and inoculation of faecal micro‐organisms is avoided. Therefore, it is theoretically associated with a reduced risk of post‐biopsy infectious complications compared to the transrectal approach.

### Prostate cancer tumour features on template prostate-mapping biopsies: implications for focal therapy [^116ihDXD]. European Urology (2014). Low credibility.

2 Methods

This study received exemption from ethics committee approval from the University College London Hospitals Joint Research Office. Our institutional TTPM biopsy registry includes all cases having this procedure. The majority of these patients were tertiary referrals to our institution with previous transrectal ultrasound–guided biopsies. TTPM biopsies were conducted using a method previously described, with cores taken every 5 mm throughout the prostate using a template grid (Fig. 1). Antibiotic prophylaxis was used with single-dose cefuroxime, gentamicin, and metronidazole at the time of induction. The complications were assessed on immediate postoperative findings and any hospital readmissions and were enquired of the patient at the 4–6-wk follow-up visit. The cancer risk group was determined using the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. Locoregional radiologic staging was performed using prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and distant metastases were ruled out using a pelvic MRI and radioisotope bone scan in any man with a Gleason score ≥ 7 on any histology, prostate-specific antigen ≥ 10 ng/ml, or clinical/MRI T stage ≥ T3a. The T stage was based on MRI characteristic only and not on histology.

Toxicity data were collected retrospectively through review of clinic notes and are reported for completeness, although they may be subject to recall bias. Criteria used to decide suitability for focal therapy were those used in prospective ethics committee–approved trials actively recruiting during the period of this study, with pathologic tumour features characterised according to a combination of cancer core length and Gleason grade(Fig. 2). We have reported the results of two of these studies. A third trial treating the index lesion is currently closed for analysis. Our current multicentre focal therapy trial incorporates all these focal therapy strategies and will aim to recruit 150 men.

In summary, suitability for focal therapy required the cancer to be (1) unifocal, (2) unilateral, (3) bilateral/bifocal with at least one neurovascular bundle avoided, or (4) bilateral/multifocal with one dominant index lesion and secondary lesions with Gleason ≤ 3 + 3 and cancer core involvement ≤ 3 mm. The avoidance of the neurovascular bundle was based on ensuring that the posterior left or right quadrant of prostate tissue was not ablated. We accept that the neurovascular bundle is not a discrete bundle but has a more complex diffuse anatomic distribution. We felt that the avoidance of a posterior quadrant at least would avoid most of the ipsilateral nerves in question.

### An update of the American Urological Association white paper on the prevention and treatment of the more common complications related to prostate biopsy [^111H4SWo]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

In this white paper update we identify and discuss the prevalence and prevention of common complications of prostate needle biopsy.

Materials and Methods

A literature review was performed on prostate biopsy complications via queries of PubMed and EMBASE ® databases for prostate biopsy complications from January 1, 2010 until June 1, 2015. We focused on infection, bleeding, urinary retention, needle tract seeding and erectile dysfunction. A total of 346 articles were identified for full text review and 119 are included in the final data synthesis.

Results

Infection is the most common complication of prostate biopsy with fluoroquinolone resistant Escherichia coli having a prominent role. Reported rates of infectious complications range from 0.1% to 7.0%, and sepsis rates range from 0.3% to 3.1% depending on antibiotic prophylaxis regimens. Mild, self-limiting and transient bleeding is also a common complication. Other complications are extremely rare.

Conclusions

This white paper provides a concise reference document for the more common prostate biopsy complications and prevention strategies. Risk assessment should be performed for all patients to identify known risk factors for harboring fluoroquinolone resistance. If infection incidence increases check the local antibiogram, current equipment and cleaning practices, and consider alternate approaches to antibiotic prevention such as needle cleaning, risk basked augmentation, rectal culture with targeted prophylaxis and transperineal biopsy. If infection occurs, actively re-situate the patient and start empiric intravenous treatment with carbapenems, amikacin or second and third generation cephalosporins.

### Cefpodoxime proxetil [^116uVExV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Lung Tissue:

Following a single, oral 200 mg cefpodoxime proxetil film-coated tablet, the mean maximum cefpodoxime concentration in lung tissue averaged 0.63 mcg/g at 3 hours post-dosing, 0.52 mcg/g at 6 hours post-dosing, and 0.19 mcg/g at 12 hours post-dosing. The results of this study indicated that cefpodoxime penetrated into lung tissue and produced sustained drug concentrations for at least 12 hours after dosing at levels that exceeded the MIC90for S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.

CSF:

Adequate data on CSF levels of cefpodoxime are not available. Effects of Decreased Renal Function:

Elimination of cefpodoxime is reduced in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (< 50 mL/min creatinine clearance). (See PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) In subjects with mild impairment of renal function (50 to 80 mL/min creatinine clearance), the average plasma half-life of cefpodoxime was 3.5 hours. In subjects with moderate (30 to 49 mL/min creatinine clearance) or severe renal impairment (5 to 29 mL/min creatinine clearance), the half-life increased to 5.9 and 9.8 hours, respectively. Approximately 23% of the administered dose was cleared from the body during a standard 3-hour hemodialysis procedure. Effect of Hepatic Impairment (cirrhosis):

Absorption was somewhat diminished and elimination unchanged in patients with cirrhosis. The mean cefpodoxime T1/2and renal clearance in cirrhotic patients were similar to those derived in studies of healthy subjects. Ascites did not appear to affect values in cirrhotic subjects. No dosage adjustment is recommended in this patient population.

Pharmacokinetics in Elderly Subjects:

Elderly subjects do not require dosage adjustments unless they have diminished renal function. (See PRECAUTIONS .) In healthy geriatric subjects, cefpodoxime half-life in plasma averaged 4.2 hours (Vs 3.3 in younger subjects) and urinary recovery averaged 21% after a 400 mg dose was administered every 12 hours. Other pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, AUC, and Tmax) were unchanged relative to those observed in healthy young subjects.

### Piperacillin sodium (pipracil) [^113fCWfr]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Intravenous Administration:

In healthy adult volunteers, mean serum piperacillin
concentrations immediately after a two‑to three‑minute
intravenous injection of 2, 4, or 6 g were 305, 412, and 775 μg/mL.
respectively. Serum concentrations lack dose proportionality.

A 30-minute infusion of 6 g every 6 h
gave, on the fourth day, a mean peak serum concentration of 420 μg/mL.

Intramuscular Administration:

PIPRACIL is rapidly absorbed after intramuscular
injection. In healthy volunteers, the mean peak serum concentration
occurs approximately 30 minutes after a single dose of 2 g and
is about 36 μg/mL. The oral administration of 1 g probenecid
before injection produces an increase in piperacillin peak serum level
of about 30%. The area under the curve (AUC) is increased by approximately
60%.

Pharmacokinetics:

PIPRACIL is not absorbed when given orally. Peak
serum concentrations are attained approximately 30 minutes after intramuscular
injections and immediately after completion of intravenous injection
or infusion. The serum half-life in healthy volunteers ranges from
36 minutes to one hour and 12 minutes. The mean elimination half-life
of PIPRACIL in healthy adult volunteers is 54 minutes following
administration of 2 g and 63 minutes following 6 g. As with
other penicillins, PIPRACIL is eliminated primarily by glomerular
filtration and tubular secretion; it is excreted rapidly as unchanged
drug in high concentrations in the urine. Approximately 60% to 80%
of the administered dose is excreted in the urine in the first 24
hours. Piperacillin urine concentrations, determined by microbioassay,
are as high as 14,100 μg/mL following a 6-g intravenous
dose and 8,500 μg/mL following a 4-g intravenous dose.
These urine drug concentrations remain well above 1,000 μg/mL
throughout the dosing interval.

Distribution:

PIPRACIL binding to human serum proteins is 16%.
The drug is widely distributed in human tissues and body fluids, including
bone, prostate, and heart, and reaches high concentrations in bile.
After a 4-g bolus injection, maximum biliary concentrations average
3,205 μg/mL. It penetrates into the cerebrospinal fluid
in the presence of inflamed meninges.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^112ZuMBn]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Second-line antimicrobial agents — when first-line medications are not available or cannot be prescribed — include β-lactams and fluoroquinolones, and "Randomized trial evidence suggests that the effectiveness of 3-day cefpodoxime or TMP-SMX is comparable at 89.4% vs 100%". However, "Generally, cephalosporins have a lower cure rate than TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones", and "β-lactams, like cephalexin, can also be used if first-line antibiotics are inappropriate for any reason". Although "3-day fluoroquinolone regimens (eg, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) are highly efficacious, they are not first-line agents because of increasing resistance, higher expense, and serious adverse events as described in a 2016 Food and Drug Administration warning". Fosfomycin pharmacokinetics are noted as "resulting in urine levels that persist for 30 to 40 hours", and "When there is greater than 20% local E. coli resistance to TMP-SMX, an alternative treatment should be given".

### European Association of Urology position paper on the prevention of infectious complications following prostate biopsy [^115sS1gD]. European Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

The transperineal approach is preferred to reduce prostate biopsy (PB)-related infections. Fluoroquinolones are suspended for prophylaxis of PB in the European Union; therefore, alternative antibiotics based on local resistance, or targeted prophylaxis, in conjunction with povidone-iodine rectal preparation are recommended for transrectal PB.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of infectious complications following prostate biopsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117N6f3x]. The Journal of Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Infectious complications following prostate biopsy are increasing and fluoroquinolone prophylaxis has recently been banned by the European Commission. In this systematic review we summarize the evidence for different antibiotic prophylaxis regimens.

Materials and Methods

We searched MEDLINE®, Embase® and Cochrane Database for randomized controlled trials (inception to October 2019) assessing antimicrobial interventions in prostate biopsy. Primary outcome was infectious complications. Exclusion criteria were simultaneous interfering interventions. GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) was used to assess the certainty of evidence. Protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42015026354).

Results

Overall 59 randomized controlled trials (14,153 participants) and 7 different antimicrobial interventions were included. Antibiotic prophylaxis reduced infectious complications compared to no prophylaxis (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40–0.77, p = 0.0005, I² = 15%, participants 1,753, studies 11). A short-term prophylaxis (single shot to 3 days) was inferior to a long-term prophylaxis (1 to 7 days) with fluoroquinolone (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.37–2.61, p = 0.0001, I² = 0%, participants 3,999, studies 17). Fosfomycin trometamol was an alternative to fluoroquinolone with reduced rates of infectious complications (RR 0.49, 95 CI 0.27–0.87, p = 0.02, I² = 54%, participants 1,239, studies 3). Empiric prophylaxis was inferior to targeted prophylaxis (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.28–2.55, p = 0.0008, I² = 48%, participants 1,511, studies 6). Standard prophylaxis was inferior to augmented prophylaxis (using multiple rather than single agent) using a fixed model (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.53–2.88, p < 0.0001, I² = 71%, participants 2,597, studies 9), but not using a random model (p = 0.07). No difference was observed in infectious complications based on route or timing of antimicrobial prophylaxis. The certainty of evidence was rated as low/very low.

Conclusions

In countries where fluoroquinolones are allowed as antibiotic prophylaxis, a minimum of a full 1-day administration as well as targeted therapy in case of fluoroquinolone resistance is recommended. In countries with a ban on fluoroquinolones, fosfomycin is a good alternative, as is augmented prophylaxis, although no established standard combination exists to date.

### Clinical importance of the antibiotic regimen in transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy: quinolone versus cephalosporin [^112uDaGM]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUS-PBx) is the standard procedure for diagnosing prostate cancer, and several million TRUS-PBx procedures are performed annually worldwide. However, one of the most serious complications associated with TRUS-PBx is infection such as urosepsis which can be potentially fatal. The hospital admission rate due to infectious complications after TRUS-PBx has been reported as 0.8–3.6% of patients. Although appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis is generally administered, an increased trend in infection-related hospitalization after TRUS-PBx has recently been reported. Potential risk factors for infectious complications after TRUS-PBx included a high comorbidity index, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, large prostate, untreated bacteriuria, an indwelling urinary catheter, bladder stones, and a recent history of urinary infection such as bacterial prostatitis. The most important clinical risk factor among many is the presence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in the rectal flora.

Antibiotic regimens play a key role in the management of TRUS-PBx and oral fluoroquinolones are used extensively for standard antibiotic prophylaxis. However, fluoroquinolone-resistant species are increasing, so the frequency of infectious complications with these antibiotic-resistant organisms is likely to increase. Various antimicrobial prophylactic regimens have been proposed previously to decrease the infectious complication rate after TRUS-PBx.

In the present study, we investigated the various clinicopathological factors associated with infectious complications after TRUS-PBx. Our country has an extended national health insurance policy that covers the expenses of an inpatient stay for the entire population, so most patients in our facility underwent TRUS-PBx as inpatients. Consequently, we had a unique opportunity to analyze the incidence of infectious complications in patients who were managed by physicians following TRUS-PBx.

### Clinical importance of the antibiotic regimen in transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy: quinolone versus cephalosporin [^114KhB8W]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed the electronic medical records of 5376 patients who underwent a multicore TRUS-PBx after admission to our institution between May 2003 and January 2013. Clinical characteristics including age, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), the antimicrobial regimen, prostate size, number of biopsies, and TRUS-PBx complications were evaluated. We excluded the patients who were administered other prophylactics (n = 77), and patients with insufficient medical data (n = 84). Finally, clinicopathological data for 5215 patients were analyzed.

Most TRUS-PBx within our institute were performed in an inpatient setting. The decision to admit a patient was made on the basis of concern of patient or the preference of the physician. Patients provided written informed consent, and underwent a single glycerin enema on the day of the biopsy. Most urine cultures were performed for 1–3 weeks before TRUS-PBx. If the urine culture showed clinically significant growth of bacteria, antibiotics based on the urine culture were prescribed and TRUS-PBx was delayed until the patients had recovered from infection. If no significant growth of bacteria was seen in the urine culture, physician-preferred prophylactic antibiotics were administered intravenously once before biopsy. Third generation cephalosporin was generally the preferred antibiotic in recent years. Between 2008 and 2013, 168 (6%) patients were given quinolone before biopsy, and 2699 patients (94%) were given third-generation cephalosporin as prophylactic antibiotics. The quinolone group received a single dose of 400 mg ciprofloxacin or 250 mg leveofloxacin. Third-generation cephalosporin groups received a single dose of 1 g flomoxef, 1 g ceftriaxone, or 1 g ceftizoxime. All patients underwent prophylactic antibiotics with the dose adjusted to renal and hepatic function. Thereafter, all patients received oral antibiotics for 2 days after TRUS-PBx. Two experienced radiologists performed TRUS-PBx, which is a routine, standard multicore biopsy that is performed using local anesthesia. In the inpatient setting, patients stayed in the hospital for 1 day or until the absence of complications such as rectal bleeding or gross hematuria was confirmed. Patients who underwent TRUS-PBx were instructed to go to an emergency room or urologic clinic if they developed a high fever, severe bleeding, or severe lower urinary tract symptoms including urinary retention. All patients were followed up as at outpatients within 2 weeks. Physicians recorded the results of TRUS-PBx and evaluated the complications at the follow-up.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for transperineal prostate biopsy [^116BWywo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

We will follow the Methodological Expectations for Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) standards when conducting this review, and the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 when reporting the review conduct and findings.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We will include all prospective randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluate any prophylactic antibiotic regimen compared to placebo or no treatment in men undergoing transperineal prostate biopsy. We will include studies regardless of their publication status, year of dissemination, or language of publication. We will exclude quasi‐RCTs and cluster‐RCTs.

Another Cochrane review protocol investigating povidone‐iodine rectal cleansing for transrectal prostate biopsy is currently under development by a separate team with some authors in common. These reviews address similar topics and are being conducted in parallel.

Types of participants

Men undergoing transperineal needle biopsy of the prostate for evaluation for prostate cancer or tissue diagnosis of a known lesion (e.g. for active surveillance).

Exclusion criteria

Presence of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) prior to antibiotic prophylaxis or history of hypersensitivity to antibiotics used in the study
Significant gastrointestinal (GI) disease or inability to tolerate or absorb oral medication
Presence of indwelling bladder catheters
History of endoscopic manipulation of the urinary tract within seven days of trial enrolment
Antibiotics given during the preceding 10 days (for other indications)
People taking antibiotic prophylaxis or treatment for other health conditions (e.g. prosthetic cardiac valves, endovascular stents, hip replacement)

If we identify studies in which only a subset of participants are relevant to this review, we will include it if data are available separately for the relevant subset.

Types of interventions

We plan to investigate the following comparisons of experimental intervention versus comparator intervention. Any concomitant interventions must be the same in the experimental and comparator groups in order to establish fair comparisons.

Experimental interventions

Prophylactic antibiotics of any dosage, on any schedule, and administered by any route

Comparator interventions

Placebo/no antibiotic prophylaxis

Comparisons

Antibiotics prophylaxis versus placebo/no antibiotic prophylaxis
Head‐to‐head comparisons of different antibiotic prophylaxis regimens Different classes of antibiotics Oral versus systemic administration Single dose versus multiple dose

### How I manage bacterial prostatitis [^112ospsy]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Bacterial prostatitis is a highly prevalent infection responsible for significant morbidity among men. The diagnosis and treatment for bacterial prostatitis remains complicated. The difficulty in diagnosis is in part owing to the paucity of high-quality evidence that guides a clinician's interpretation of patients' history, physical examination, and laboratory findings. Treatment is challenging because of the few antimicrobials capable of prostate penetration, growing antimicrobial resistance limiting effective treatment options, and the high risk of recurrence.

Objectives

We aimed to provide a useful resource for clinicians in effectively diagnosing and managing acute bacterial prostatitis (ABP) and chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP).

Sources

A PubMed literature search on prostatitis was performed with no restrictions on publication date.

Content

The epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment for ABP and CBP are explored using a clinical vignette as relevant context.

Implications

Bacterial prostatitis can be diagnosed through a focused history and microbiological investigations. The Meares-Stamey 4-glass test or modified 2-glass test can help confirm the diagnosis if uncertainty exists. Typical uropathogens are common contributors to bacterial prostatitis but there is growing interest in exploring the role atypical and traditional non-pathogenic organisms may have. Fluoroquinolones remain first-line therapy, followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or doxycycline if the pathogen is susceptible. Fosfomycin has emerged as a repurposed and useful agent because of the increasing incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens. Selection of appropriate antimicrobial regimens can be challenging and is dependent on the host, chronicity of symptoms, uropathogens' susceptibilities, antimicrobials' side effect profile, and the presence of prostatic abscesses or calcifications. ABP can typically be treated similar to other complicated urinary tract infections. However, CBP requires prolonged therapy, with a minimum of 4 weeks and up to 12 weeks of therapy.

### The evolution of knowledge for treating Gram-negative bacterial infections [^115J9hgT]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Infections caused by nonprimarily pathogenic Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) have been increasingly reported from the second half of the 20th century to the present. This phenomenon has expanded during the antibiotic era and in the presence of immunodeficiency. Before the discovery of sulphonamides and penicillin G, infections caused by GNB were rare compared to Gram-positive infections. The advent of anticancer therapy, the expansion of surgical procedures, the use of corticosteroids, and the implantation of prosthetic materials, along with better control of Gram-positive infections, have promoted the current increase in GNB infections.GNB have similar antimicrobial targets to Gram-positive bacteria. However, only antibiotics that can penetrate the double membrane of GNB and remain in them for a sufficient duration have antibacterial activity against them.

Recent Findings

Sulphonamides and early penicillins had limited activity against GNB. Ampicillin and subsequent beta-lactams expanded their spectrum to treat GNB. Aminoglycosides may re-surge with less toxic drugs, as highly resistant to beta-lactams GNB rise. Polymyxins, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones are also used for GNB. Combinations with other agents may be needed in specific cases, such as in the central nervous system and prostate, where beta-lactams may have difficulty reaching the infection site. Alternatives to current treatments must be sought in the discovery of new drug families and therapies such as phage therapy combined with antibiotics.

Summary

Narrower-spectrum immunosuppressive therapies and antibiotics, antimicrobials that minimally intervene with the human microbiota, and instant diagnostic methods are necessary to imagine a future where currently dominant bacteria in infectious pathology lose their preeminence.

### Cefpodoxime proxetil [^114Kt3KY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute, uncomplicated urethral and cervical gonorrhea caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae (including penicillinase-producing strains).

Acute, uncomplicated ano-rectal infections in women due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae (including penicillinase-producing strains).

NOTE: The efficacy of cefpodoxime in treating male patients with rectal infections caused by N. gonorrhoeae has not been established. Data do not support the use of cefpodoxime proxetil in the treatment of pharyngeal infections due to N. gonorrhoeae in men or women.

Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (including penicillinase-producing strains) or Streptococcus pyogenes. Abscesses should be surgically drained as clinically indicated.

NOTE: In clinical trials, successful treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections was dose-related. The effective therapeutic dose for skin infections was higher than those used in other recommended indications. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .)

Acute maxillary sinusitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-producing strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (cystitis) caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, or Staphylococcus saprophyticus.

NOTE: In considering the use of cefpodoxime proxetil in the treatment of cystitis, cefpodoxime proxetil's lower bacterial eradication rates should be weighed against the increased eradication rates and different safety profiles of some other classes of approved agents. (See CLINICAL STUDIES section.)

Appropriate specimens for bacteriological examination should be obtained in order to isolate and identify causative organisms and to determine their susceptibility to cefpodoxime. Therapy may be instituted while awaiting the results of these studies. Once these results become available, antimicrobial therapy should be adjusted accordingly.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of cefpodoxime proxetil and other antibacterial drugs, cefpodoxime proxetil should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Efficacy of fosfomycin compared to second generation cephalosporin flumarin as antimicrobial prophylaxis for transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy: a single center retrospective study [^114YzG3Q]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

The efficacy of fosfomycin in preventing infectious complications after TRUS-guided prostate biopsies has been studied in several randomized controlled trials (RCT) and meta-analysis with some conflicting results. Sen et al. in their RCT have compared single dose of 3 g fosfomycin with 500 mg of oral ciprofloxacin and concluded that fosfomycin is a strong alternative antibiotic prophylaxis for TRUS-guided prostate biopsy. Lista et al. in their RCT have also compared two doses of 3 g fosfomycin with 10 doses of 500 mg oral ciprofloxacin and concluded that fosfomycin is as effective as ciprofloxacin. A meta-analysis of three RCTs and two other meta-analysis that included non-RCTs all significantly favored fosfomycin over quinolone-based prophylaxis. On the other hand, in a large Canadian cohort study involving 9,391 subjects, it was found that fosfomycin was not an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin. The reason for such conflicting results might be due to limitations with clinical trials studying the efficacy of fosfomycin as antimicrobial prophylaxis for TRUS-guided prostate biopsy including variation in dosage (single dose versus double dose), variation in drug infusion time (night before versus just before procedure), heterogenous biopsy technique and follow-up protocol, variation in definition of infectious complications, and variation of fluoroquinolone resistance rate of study population. Still, the overall result seems to be positive for using fosfomycin, although standardization of study parameters is needed to have a more robust conclusion.

### Clinical importance of the antibiotic regimen in transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy: quinolone versus cephalosporin [^114SVb46]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Results

Clinicopathological characteristics of the 5215 TRUS-PBx patients included in the final analysis are shown Table 1. The mean age and median PSA of the entire cohort were 64.7 ± 9.3 years and 6.5 ng/ml (interquartile range, 4.3–10.6 ng/ml), respectively. Of these patients, 19% were included in the quinolone group and 81% in the third-generation cephalosporin group. Twenty-eight (0.54%) patients developed an infectious complication that required hospitalization after TRUS-PBx (Table 1).

Table 1
Comparison of clinicopathological features among men who underwent a contemporary multicore prostate biopsy

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses of infection-related hospitalization after TRUS-PBx are shown in Table 2. Univariate analyses indicated that a prophylactic antibiotics regimen based on third-generation cephalosporin (OR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.10–0.42, p < 0.001) and severe IPSS (OR = 3.37, 95% CI 1.32–8.60, p = 0.011) were independent predictors of infection-related hospitalization after TRUS-PBx (Table 2). Multivariate analysis of 4932 patients indicated that third-generation cephalosporin (OR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.10–0.44, p < 0.001) and severe IPSS (OR = 3.18, 95% CI 1.24–8.13, p = 0.016) were also independent predictors of infection-related hospitalization after TRUS-PBx (Table 2).

Table 10: Steady-state Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Multiple Oral and Intravenous Doses (Adults)

*: AUC0–12hx 2
AUC0–8hx 3

Food

When ciprofloxacin tablets are given concomitantly with food, there is a delay in the absorption of the drug, resulting in peak concentrations that occur closer to 2 hours after dosing rather than 1 hour. The overall absorption of ciprofloxacin tablets, however, is not substantially affected. Avoid concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin with dairy products (like milk or yogurt) or calcium-fortified juices alone since decreased absorption is possible; however, ciprofloxacin may be taken with a meal that contains these products.

Distribution

The binding of ciprofloxacin to serum proteins is 20% to 40% which is not likely to be high enough to cause significant protein binding interactions with other drugs.

After oral administration, ciprofloxacin is widely distributed throughout the body. Tissue concentrations often exceed serum concentrations in both men and women, particularly in genital tissue including the prostate. Ciprofloxacin is present in active form in the saliva, nasal and bronchial secretions, mucosa of the sinuses, sputum, skin blister fluid, lymph, peritoneal fluid, bile, and prostatic secretions. Ciprofloxacin has also been detected in lung, skin, fat, muscle, cartilage, and bone. The drug diffuses into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); however, CSF concentrations are generally less than 10% of peak serum concentrations. Low levels of the drug have been detected in the aqueous and vitreous humors of the eye.

Metabolism

Four metabolites have been identified in human urine which together account for approximately 15% of an oral dose. The metabolites have antimicrobial activity, but are less active than unchanged ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin is an inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) mediated metabolism. Co-administration of ciprofloxacin with other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 results in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and could lead to clinically significant adverse events of the co-administered drug [see Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.10, 5.16), and Drug Interactions (7)].

Risk of bias assessment in included studies

Two of the four review authors (YTX, YY, MC, WH) will assess the risk of bias of each included study independently. We will resolve disagreements by consensus or by consulting a third review author (JVAF). We will assess the risk of bias using Cochrane's RoB 2 assessment tool, August 2019 version, for all outcomes listed in the outcome measures section. For all outcomes, the effect of interest will be the 'intention‐to‐treat (ITT) effect', i.e. the effect of assignment to the interventions at baseline, regardless of whether the interventions are received as intended.

We will assess the risk of bias for the following RoB 2 domains:

Bias arising from the randomisation process
Bias due to deviations from intended interventions
Bias due to missing outcome data
Bias in measurement of outcome
Bias in selection of the outcome

Following the RoB 2 instructions, we will answer the signalling questions to reach a risk‐of‐bias judgment of 'low risk of bias', 'some concerns', or 'high risk of bias' for each domain. We will then use the tool algorithm to reach an overall risk of bias for each outcome. We will develop and use a web tool for managing independent risk of bias assessments, based on RoB 2 resources available via.

Measures of treatment effect

For dichotomous outcomes, we will estimate risk ratios (RRs). We will assess the precision and significance of the results using 95% confidence intervals (CI). For the continuous outcome (QoL), we will estimate the intervention effect using the mean difference (MD), with 95% CI, if the outcomes are measured on the same scale, or the standardised mean difference (SMD), if the outcomes are measured using different scales. For rare event rates (below 1%), we will use the odds ratio (OR). We will set minimal clinically important differences (MCID) to identify the proportion of participants that experience a clinically meaningful change.

Unit of analysis issues

The unit of analysis will be the individual participant. Should we identify trials with more than two intervention groups that are eligible for inclusion in the review, we will handle these in accordance with guidance provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Specifically, we plan to use the recommended approach of combining groups to create a single pair‐wise comparison. We will discuss the potential bias introduced by combining intervention groups in the 'Discussion' section of the review.

### Cefpodoxime proxetil [^113s7mSL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of cefpodoxime were investigated in 29 patients aged 1 to 17 years. Each patient received a single, oral, 5 mg/kg dose of cefpodoxime oral suspension. Plasma and urine samples were collected for 12 hours after dosing. The plasma levels reported from this study are as follows:

Distribution:

Protein binding of cefpodoxime ranges from 22 to 33% in serum and from 21 to 29% in plasma.

Skin Blister:

Following multiple-dose administration every 12 hours for 5 days of 200 mg or 400 mg cefpodoxime proxetil, the mean maximum cefpodoxime concentration in skin blister fluid averaged 1.6 and 2.8 mcg/mL, respectively. Skin blister fluid cefpodoxime levels at 12 hours after dosing averaged 0.2 and 0.4 mcg/mL for the 200 mg and 400 mg multiple-dose regimens, respectively.

Tonsil Tissue:

Following a single, oral 100 mg cefpodoxime proxetil film-coated tablet, the mean maximum cefpodoxime concentration in tonsil tissue averaged 0.24 mcg/g at 4 hours post-dosing and 0.09 mcg/g at 7 hours post-dosing. Equilibrium was achieved between plasma and tonsil tissue within 4 hours of dosing. No detection of cefpodoxime in tonsillar tissue was reported 12 hours after dosing. These results demonstrated that concentrations of cefpodoxime exceeded the MIC90of S. pyogenes for at least 7 hours after dosing of 100 mg of cefpodoxime proxetil.

### Clinical importance of the antibiotic regimen in transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy: quinolone versus cephalosporin [^114g4kej]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

The prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant E.coli has changed in Korea, Lee et al. recently reported on data from the Korean antimicrobial resistance monitoring system between 2008 and 2009 that indicated E.coli isolates from cystitis patients had 75% susceptibility to quinolone and 95% susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporin. Resistant E.coli rates also have also increased in other Asian countries. Our study shows that use of third-generation cephalosporin before TRUS-PBx resulted in a significant decrease in infection-related hospitalization after TRUS-PBx. The pathogenesis of infectious complications after TRUS-PBx can be explained by the invasion of bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract, and cephalosporins are recommended as a prophylactic antibiotic in colorectal surgery. The most appropriate regimen during TRUS-PBx is controversial. Our results showed that a regimen of prophylactic third-generation cephalosporin has a significant advantage in the context of preventing rehospitalization due to infectious complications after TRUS-PBx in an era of the emergence of quinolone-resistant microorganisms.

Interestingly, our data showed that severe symptoms on the IPSS questionnaire were significantly associated with hospitalization after TRUS-PBx. As lower urinary tract symptoms may partially indicate inflammation of the prostate and periprostatic tissue, TRUS-PBx could aggravate the inflammatory status of the prostate and result in a systemic inflammatory syndrome with high fever after prostate biopsy. Moreover, antibiotic-resistant bacteria increase following pre-administration of medication for prostatitis. Mosharafa et al. reported that prior fluoroquinolone intake is a significant risk factor for acute prostatitis after TRUS-guided biopsy. Additionally, the results of increased infection could be explained by bladder emptying which is known to be a very important factor in preventing urinary tract infection. High IPSS scores would be associated with inadequate bladder emptying, which could cause bacterial growth. In light of these findings, we consider the IPSS score in our current TRUS-PBx protocol, and recommend more stringent protocols for prophylaxis in men high IPSS scores.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for transperineal prostate biopsy [^112husM5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

Our outcome measures do not form part of our inclusion criteria; we will not exclude any studies based on its outcomes. If none of our critical or important outcomes are reported in an included study, we will contact the study authors to ask if they planned to measure any of these outcomes, whether any of the outcomes were measured, and whether any data are available and can be provided to us.

There are no established core outcome sets for this review question. A related outcome set for UTIs indicates that the presence and duration of symptoms might be important critical outcomes, but this outcome set pertains to treatment rather than prophylaxis. In the context of a biopsy, a UTI needs confirmation by urinalysis or urine culture. We therefore selected and prioritised the outcomes for this review based on clinical experience and consumer input. In the medical literature, we expect to find established MCIDs for some quality‐of‐life outcomes, but we are not aware of established MCIDs for any of our other critical and important outcomes. We therefore determined the MCIDs for these outcomes based on clinical experience.

Critical outcomes

Sepsis: systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) caused by infection (SIRS defined as two or more of the following: temperature ≥ 38 °C or less than ≥ 36 °C; heart rate more than 90 beats/minute; respiratory rate more than 20 breaths/minute or respiratory alkalosis; white blood cell count more than 12,000/mm³ or immature forms more than 4000/mm³ or more than 10%) when encountered in the 7‐day postoperative period. We will also accept other definitions set by the investigators. We will use an absolute difference of 2% (20 per 1000) in sepsis rate as the minimal clinically important difference (MCID).
Adverse events (AEs): we will focus on AEs reported in the trial that can be assumed to be secondary to the intervention, including hospitalisation for complications of biopsy, emergency department visits, and any other patient‐reported local AEs encountered within a 30‐day period after the biopsy is performed. We will set an MCID of 5% absolute difference (50 per 1000) in the rates of AEs.
Urinary tract infection (UTI): we will evaluate post‐intervention UTI cases associated with clinical signs of UTI (dysuria, frequency, urgency) and confirmed by either urinalysis or urine culture in the 7‐day postoperative period. We will use an MCID of 5% (50 per 1000) absolute difference in the rates of UTIs.

### Prophylactic antibiotic use in transurethral prostatic resection: a meta-analysis [^117MYJvk]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

We reviewed the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in men undergoing transurethral prostatic resection, a clean contaminated procedure.

Materials and Methods

We systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials of antibiotic prophylaxis for transurethral prostatic resection with a meta-analysis of the results. We identified 32 randomized controlled trials with 4,260 participants examining the postoperative bacteriuria incidence. An 8-trial subset with 1,979 participants examined postoperative septicemia occurrence.

Results

Prophylactic antibiotic use in patients at low risk undergoing transurethral prostatic resection significantly decreased bacteriuria and clinical septicemia incidence. The bacteriuria incidence decreased from 26% to 9.1% (relative risk reduction 65%, 95% confidence interval -56 to -73). The clinical septicemia incidence decreased from 4.4% to 0.7% (relative risk reduction 77%, 95% confidence interval -55 to -88). Effective antibiotic classes included quinolones, cephalosporins, co-trimoxazole and aminoglycosides. Treatment protocols of any duration were effective. Subgroup analysis of cephalosporin based trials indicated that short treatment protocols appeared more effective than single dose protocols. Based on these results if 1,000 patients with sterile urine undergoing transurethral prostatic resection were given prophylactic antibiotics, bacteriuria would be avoided in 175, while septicemia would be prevented in 9 to 20.

Conclusions

Antibiotic prophylaxis significantly decreases the incidence of bacteriuria and clinical septicemia in men with preoperative sterile urine undergoing transurethral prostatic resection. A significant decrease in bacteriuria incidence can be achieved with a range of antibiotic agents, including quinolones, cephalosporins and co-trimoxazole. Short course antibiotic protocols may be more effective than single dose regimens.

### Acute bacterial prostatitis and abscess formation [^114Be3dd]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Data collection

This study is a retrospective, multicenter cohort study. Chart review for each patient was done. Distinguishable individual information was thoroughly removed during data collection. Data were gathered from four teaching hospitals with 600–1000 beds in the capital region of Korea (Seoul and Gyeonggi) using a web-based electronic system. Data were shared among all of the involved institutions. A central office managed all electronically recorded data.

Study population and design

Any male patient between 20 and 80 years old who presented between January 2012 and December 2014 was eligible for the study. Patients were considered to have acute prostate infection if they met the following criteria: (i) one or more recent symptoms and signs such as voiding disturbance, dysuria, urgency, frequency, perineal pain, suprapubic pain or tenderness during digital rectal exam; (ii) fever (temperature of tympanic membrane > 37.8 °C,); and (iii) ≥ 5 white blood cells per high-power field in the urine. All included patients had undergone computed tomography (CT) or transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS). Such imaging studies were used to determine the presence or absence of an abscess. Successive cultures from the same patient were excluded to avoid data duplication during the treatment period. Patients with recurrent prostatitis were also excluded because the condition could negatively or positively influence susceptibility data. In order to access voiding function, uroflowmetry or post-void residual urine were checked in non-catheterized patients. Underlying diseases were reviewed based on patient medical records.

The sensitive automatic MicroScan identification system (Baxter Diagnostics, Inc. MicroScan, West Sacramento, California, USA) was used to identify causative bacteria. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured using the microbroth dilution method. The following antibiotics were used to measure MICs: ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam and co-trimoxazole. A Sensitive/Intermediate/Resistant (SIR) interpretation was used for simple description and easy comparison of the data. We applied the standard Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines to establish the MIC breakpoints.

### Clinical importance of the antibiotic regimen in transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy: quinolone versus cephalosporin [^115DC3Yp]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Until innovative new technology can replace the TRUS-PBx in the future, this procedure will be performed several million times every year worldwide to diagnose prostate cancer. Several prevention strategies to reduce serious infectious complications after TRUS-PBx have been attempted to improve the safety of patients undergoing this procedure. Among the strategies, antibiotic prophylaxis can play an important key role in prevention of infection after TRUS-PBx. Current guidelines recommended the use of fluoroquinolones or cephalosporin (first generation, second generation, or third generation) before prostate biopsy. Alternative antimicrobial regimens such as aminoglycosides plus metronidazole or clindamycin have been recommended. In many studies, fluoroquinolones were used to examine empirical antimicrobial prophylaxis before prostate biopsy. In addition, fluoroquinolone-based antimicrobial prophylaxis is still used worldwide for standard antibiotic prophylaxis.

However, an increasing rate of infectious complications after TRUS-PBx due to the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria has recently been reported. Adibi et al. showed that the addition of one dose of intramuscular gentamicin with ciprofloxacin reduced the rate of re-hospitalization due to infectious complications after prostate biopsy from 3.8 to 0.6%. Gianna et al. reported that a combination of orally administered quinolone and periprostatic injection of cephalosporin controls infection caused by fluoroquinolone-resistant E.coli. The rates of rehospitalization after TRUS-PBx were 5.7 and 0% in the conventional quinolone group and the combination group, respectively. Bartus et al. reported that adding amikacin to fluoroquinolone-based antimicrobial prophylaxis confers a significant benefit in preventing infections after TRUS-guided biopsy. In contrast, Hori et al. reported that ciprofloxacin provides superior prophylaxis compared to co-amoxiclav in men undergoing TRUS-PBx. Although eight men (7.3%) in the co-amoxiclav group developed sepsis, only two men in the ciprofloxacin group (1.7%) developed sepsis after TRUS-PBx.

### Antimicrobial therapy for bacterial and nonbacterial prostatitis [^112oqsyk]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy is the standard of care for the unusual man with true chronic bacterial prostatitis but does not have much of a role in the treatment of men with nonbacterial prostatitis. The fluoroquinolone antibiotics given for 2 to 4 weeks will cure about 70% of chronic bacterial infections of the prostate. If this treatment fails, the symptomatic manifestations of the infections can almost always be eliminated with suppressive antimicrobial therapy using trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, or nitrofurantoin.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for transrectal prostate biopsy [^114P1iZw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Transrectal prostate biopsy (TRPB) is a well established procedure used to obtain tissue for the histological diagnosis of carcinoma of the prostate. Despite the fact that TRPB is generally considered a safe procedure, it may be accompanied by traumatic and infective complications, including asymptomatic bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine), urinary tract infection (UTI), transitory bacteremia (bacteria in the blood), fever episodes, and sepsis (pathogenic microorganisms or their toxins in the blood). Although infective complications after TRPB are well known, there is uncertainty about the necessity and effectiveness of routine prophylactic antibiotics and their adverse effects, as well as a clear lack of standardization.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and adverse effects of prophylactic antibiotic treatment in TRPB.

Search Strategy

The search covered the principal electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Experts were consulted and references from the relevant articles were scanned.

Selection Criteria

All randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) of men who underwent TRPB and received prophylactic antibiotics or placebo/no treatment, were selected, and all RCTs looking at one type of antibiotic versus another, including comparable dosages, routes of administration, frequency of administration, and duration of antibiotic treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers (ELZ, OACC) independently selected included trials and extracted study data. Any disagreements were resolved by a third party (NRNJ).

Main Results

Overall, more than 3500 references were considered and 19 original reports with a total of 3599 patients were included. There were 9 trials analysing antibiotics versus placebo/no treatment, with all outcomes significantly favouring antibiotic use (P < 0.05) (I(2) = 0%), including bacteriuria (risk ratio (RR) 0.25 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.42), bacteremia (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.92), fever (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.64), urinary tract infection (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.62), and hospitalization (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.55). Several classes of antibiotics were effective prophylactically for TRPB, while the quinolones, with the highest number of studies (5) and patients (1188), were the best analysed. For 'antibiotics versus enema', we analysed four studies with a limited number of patients. The differences between groups for all outcomes were not significant. For 'antibiotic versus antibiotic + enema', only the risk of bacteremia (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.75) was diminished in the 'antibiotic + enema group'. Seven trials reported the effects of short-course (1 day) versus long-course (3 days) antibiotics. Long course was significantly better than short-course treatment only for bacteriuria (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.17 to 3.73). For 'single versus multiple dose', there was significantly greater risk of bacteriuria for single-dose treatment (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.33). Comparing oral versus systemic administration - intramuscular injection (IM), or intravenous (IV) - of antibiotics, there were no significant differences in the groups for bacteriuria, fever, UTI and hospitalization.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in preventing infectious complications following TRPB. There is no definitive data to confirm that antibiotics for long-course (3 days) are superior to short-course treatments (1 day), or that multiple-dose treatment is superior to single-dose.

a Logistic regression analysis used to evaluate 5215 patients

Ten of the 15 patients with infectious complications who received prophylactic quinolone showed quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli in a blood culture, and three of this subgroup developed septic shock, that resulted in one death (Table 3). A lower rate of isolated bacteria, which was resistant to prophylactic antibiotics was observed in patients who were admitted after receiving prophylactic third-generation cephalosporin versus quinolone (3/13 [23.1%] vs. 10/15 [66.7%], p = 0.021). Interestingly, none of the patients who received prophylactic third-generation cephalosporin developed septic shock or died (Table 3). Eleven of 28 patients hospitalized due to high fever after TRUS-PBx showed no significant growth of bacteria in culture. However, the fever in these patients was controlled with conservative management including adequate administration of antibiotics.

### Penicillin g potassium (pfizerpen) [^115xv5UF]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The clearance of penicillin G in normal individuals is predominantly via the kidney. The renal clearance, which is extremely rapid, is the result of glomerular filtration and active tubular transport, with the latter route predominating. Urinary recovery is reported to be 58–85% of the administered dose. Renal clearance of penicillin is delayed in premature infants, neonates and in the elderly due to decreased renal function. The serum half-life of penicillin G correlates inversely with age and clearance of creatinine and ranges from 3.2 hours in infants 0 to 6 days of age to 1.4 hours in infants 14 days of age or older.

Nonrenal clearance includes hepatic metabolism and, to a lesser extent, biliary excretion. The latter routes become more important with renal impairment.

Probenecid blocks the renal tubular secretion of penicillin. Therefore, the concurrent administration of probenecid prolongs the elimination of penicillin G and, consequently, increases serum concentrations.

Penicillin G is distributed to most areas of the body including lung, liver, kidney, muscle, bone and placenta. In the presence of inflammation, levels of penicillin in abscesses, middle ear, pleural, peritoneal and synovial fluids are sufficient to inhibit most susceptible bacteria. Penetration in the eye, brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or prostate is poor in the absence of inflammation. With inflamed meninges, the penetration of penicillin G into the CSF improves, such that the CSF/serum ratio is 2–6%. Inflammation also enhances its penetration into the pericardial fluid. Penicillin G is actively secreted into the bile resulting in levels at least 10 times those achieved simultaneously in serum. Penicillin G penetrates poorly into human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.

Dealing with missing data

We will obtain missing data from study authors, if feasible, and will perform ITT analyses if data are available; otherwise, we will perform available‐case analysis. We will investigate attrition rates, such as dropouts, losses to follow‐up, and withdrawals, and will critically appraise issues of missing data. We will not impute missing data.

Reporting bias assessment

We will attempt to obtain study protocols to assess for selective outcome reporting.

If we include a sufficient number of studies (at least 10) that investigate a particular outcome, we will use funnel plots to assess small‐study effects, which we will interpret in a manner consistent with guidance in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

Synthesis methods

If we identify multiple studies that we consider to be sufficiently similar, we will summarise data using the random‐effects model of meta‐analysis. We will perform statistical analysis according to the statistical guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. For dichotomous outcomes, we will use the Mantel‐Haenszel method; for continuous outcomes, we will use the inverse variance method. We will use Review Manager (RevMan) software to perform analyses.

The primary analysis will include all eligible studies, regardless of the risk of bias assessment.

If we judge meta‐analysis to be inappropriate, we will not report outcome results as the pooled effect estimate in a meta‐analysis, but will instead refer to methodological guidance on alternative synthesis methods in Chapter 12 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the Synthesis Without Meta‐analysis (SWiM) reporting guidelines. We will create a table with studies ordered by risk of bias, and calculate standardised effect estimates for each study, based on the worked example, Table 12.4.b, in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. If available, we will use forest plots and albatross plots to graphically represent the study data.

### Chronic bacterial prostatitis: efficacy of short-lasting antibiotic therapy with prulifloxacin (unidrox ®) in association with saw palmetto extract, Lactobacillus sporogens and arbutin (lactorepens ®) [^1113vCgS]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial prostatitis (BP) is a common condition in which an infective origin is accepted, and accounts for about 5–10% of all prostatitis cases. This is one of the most common reasons for younger men to consult with a urologist. Regarding duration of symptoms, we describe two main types: acute and chronic. In particular, when chronic, symptoms last more than 3 months and in agreement with the National Institute of Health (NIH) chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) is classified as type II. Even if in many cases the aetiology is known, in others there are only these symptoms: pelvic area pain and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Chronic prostatitis is a condition that significantly hampers the quality of life (QoL) of the majority of patients affected, because it is not only a physical condition but also a psychological distress. The impact of CBP is similar to those patients who had a myocardial infarction, unstable angina or Crohn's disease. Pathophysiology of CBP at the moment remains unknown although some mechanisms of actions, like infectious, immunological, neurological, endocrine and psychological, have been postulated. Commonly patients are treated with antibiotics alone as recommended by the European Urology guidelines. In particular, for chronic bacterial prostatitis, fluoroquinolones, thanks to their favourable pharmacokinetic properties, prostate penetration, bioavailability and excellent activity against typical/atypical pathogens together with a good safety profile, are considered drugs of choice. The use of fluoroquinolones, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, is strengthened by the well-known evidence that CBP is commonly caused by Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, and also by the recent consideration of some authors that reported an emerging prevalence of Gram-positive and atypical bacteria together with anaerobes. Usually high-doses and a long-lasting therapy are preferred because only low-molecular-weight and lipid-soluble drugs, not tightly connected to plasma proteins, are able to penetrate the epithelial membrane, even considering reported side-effects (gastrointestinal disorders and development of antibiotics resistance). This approach, although recommended, may not be enough, considering patients' and urologists' high rate of dissatisfaction. Furthermore, given the overlapping of lower urinary tract symptoms, antibiotics alone could be inadequate. The main purpose of the therapy is to eradicate uropathogens without forgetting to relieve symptoms that mainly act on QoL. Considering the heterogeneous nature of chronic prostatitis and recurrence rate of this disorder, a multimodal approach to the prolonged antibiotic therapy may be helpful for the solution of the problem at hand. The use of plant-derived products is reaching popularity in North America and Europe and is often one of the treatments of choice for chronic conditions. Main advantages of such a therapy are unique mechanisms of action, response against LUTS, low side-effects profile, low cost and high level of acceptance by patients. Main disadvantages are unknown drug interactions and meaningless labels. Serenoa Repens, saw palmetto extract, is the most commonly used phyto-therapy in urology and has an action against type I-II 5-α-reductase (conversion of testosterone in dihydrotestosterone), anti-inflammatory effect by inhibition of arachidonic acid metabolites and also an anti-edematous effect. Arbutin, the active principle of bearberry, is an antioxidant agent with an anti-inflammatory action through lypopolisaccharide induced production of NO and expression of iNOS and COX-2. The use of probiotics, in particular lactobacillus sporogens, is a good alternative for the treatment and prevention of urinary tract infection (UTI) through different mechanisms including attachment to the uroepithelial cells and direct antimicrobial activity. Lactobacillus is an important part of the normal flora, which is commonly found in the mouth cavity, gastrointestinal tract and genitourinary tract. Reduction in number of lactobacillus increases the risk of UTI.

### Efficacy of fosfomycin compared to second generation cephalosporin flumarin as antimicrobial prophylaxis for transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy: a single center retrospective study [^1117irGD]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Fluoroquinolone has been the historic choice of antimicrobial prophylaxis for transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided prostate biopsy. However, increased fluoroquinolone resistance and recent restrictions of its use for antimicrobial prophylaxis has led to the emergence of alternative agents for antimicrobial prophylaxis for TRUS guided prostate biopsy including fosfomycin and cephalosporins. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of fosfomycin and a second-generation cephalosporin flumarin as alternative antimicrobials for TRUS-guided prostate biopsy in terms of the incidence of infectious complications after TRUS-guided prostate biopsy.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent TRUS-guided prostate biopsy between November 2009 to January 2023 was undertaken. Comparison of baseline characteristics and the incidence of infectious complications was done between those who received fosfomycin as antimicrobial prophylaxis for TRUS-guided prostate biopsy and those who received flumarin. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify risk factors for infectious complications after TRUS-guided prostate biopsy.

Results

Of 2,900 patients identified as eligible candidates for analysis, 333 (11.5%) received fosfomycin and 2,567 (88.5%) received flumarin. The overall rate of infectious complications was approximately 3% lower in patients who received fosfomycin, although such difference did not reach statistical significance (5.7% vs. 8.6%, p = 0.074). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that history of operation done under general anaesthesia within six months of the biopsy (odds ratio [OR]: 2.216; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.042–4.713; p = 0.039) and history of prior antimicrobial use within six months (OR: 1.457; 95% CI: 1.049–2.024; p = 0.025) were significant risk factors for infectious complications after TRUS-guided prostate biopsy.

Conclusion

Fosfomycin was comparable to second-generation cephalosporin flumarin in preventing infectious complications after TRUS-guided prostate biopsy. Coupled with its properties such as ease of administration, low adverse effects, low resistance rate, and low collateral damage, fosfomycin might be an attractive alternative antimicrobial prophylaxis for TRUS-guided prostate biopsy.

### ESCMID / EUCIC clinical practice guidelines on perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in patients colonized by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria before surgery [^112LdCjt]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Scope

The aim of the guidelines is to provide recommendations on perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) in adult inpatients who are carriers of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) before surgery.

Methods

These evidence-based guidelines were developed after a systematic review of published studies on PAP targeting the following MDR-GNB: extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), aminoglycoside-resistant Enterobacterales, fluoroquinolone-resistant Enterobacterales, cotrimoxazole-resistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), extremely drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, colistin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, and pan-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. The critical outcomes were the occurrence of surgical site infections (SSIs) caused by any bacteria and/or by the colonizing MDR-GNB, and SSI-attributable mortality. Important outcomes included the occurrence of any type of postsurgical infectious complication, all-cause mortality, and adverse events of PAP, including development of resistance to targeted (culture-based) PAP after surgery and incidence of Clostridioides difficile infections. The last search of all databases was performed until April 30, 2022. The level of evidence and strength of each recommendation were defined according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Consensus of a multidisciplinary expert panel was reached for the final list of recommendations. Antimicrobial stewardship considerations were included in the recommendation development.

Recommendations

The guideline panel reviewed the evidence, per bacteria, of the risk of SSIs in patients colonized with MDR-GNB before surgery and critically appraised the existing studies. Significant knowledge gaps were identified, and most questions were addressed by observational studies. Moderate to high risk of bias was identified in the retrieved studies, and the majority of the recommendations were supported by low level of evidence. The panel conditionally recommends rectal screening and targeted PAP for fluoroquinolone-resistant Enterobacterales before transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy and for extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales in patients undergoing colorectal surgery and solid organ transplantation. Screening for CRE and CRAB is suggested before transplant surgery after assessment of the local epidemiology. Careful consideration of the laboratory workload and involvement of antimicrobial stewardship teams before implementing the screening procedures or performing changes in PAP are warranted. High-quality prospective studies to assess the impact of PAP among CRE and CRAB carriers performing high-risk surgeries are advocated. Future well-designed clinical trials should assess the effectiveness of targeted PAP, including the monitoring of MDR-GNB colonization through postoperative cultures using European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing clinical breakpoints.

### PSA reduction (after antibiotics) permits to avoid or postpone prostate biopsy in selected patients [^112p8JQx]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Microscopic foci of prostatitis may induce prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase. PSA reduction after antibiotics might identify those patients in whom biopsy can be avoided. Ninety-nine patients received ciprofloxacin for 3 weeks, of whom 59 showed PSA reduction. Histology detected small foci of prostatitis in 65% of cases. Carcinoma was found in 40 and 20.3% of patients with unchanged or decreased PSA, respectively (P = 0.03). No cancer was detected if PSA decreased below 4 ng/ml or more than 70%. Biopsy can be postponed, with a low risk of missing a cancer, if PSA decreases more than 70% or below 4 ng/ml.

### Penicillin g potassium [^114zxyMf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The clearance of penicillin G in normal individuals is predominantly via the kidney. The renal clearance, which is extremely rapid, is the result of glomerular filtration and active tubular transport, with the latter route predominating. Urinary recovery is reported to be 58 to 85% of the administered dose. Renal clearance of penicillin is delayed in premature infants, neonates and in the elderly due to decreased renal function. The serum half-life of penicillin G correlates inversely with age and clearance of creatinine and ranges from 3.2 hours in infants 0 to 6 days of age to 1.4 hours in infants 14 days of age or older.

Nonrenal clearance includes hepatic metabolism and, to a lesser extent, biliary excretion. The latter routes become more important with renal impairment.

Probenecid blocks the renal tubular secretion of penicillin. Therefore, the concurrent administration of probenecid prolongs the elimination of penicillin G and, consequently, increases the serum concentrations.

Penicillin G is distributed to most areas of the body including lung, liver, kidney, muscle, bone and placenta. In the presence of inflammation, levels of penicillin in abscesses, middle ear, pleural, peritoneal and synovial fluids are sufficient to inhibit most susceptible bacteria. Penetration in the eye, brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or prostate is poor in the absence of inflammation. With inflamed meninges, the penetration of penicillin G into the CSF improves, such that the CSF/serum ratio is 2 to 6%. Inflammation also enhances its penetration into the pericardial fluid. Penicillin G is actively secreted into the bile resulting in levels at least 10 times those achieved simultaneously in serum. Penicillin G penetrates poorly into human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.

### High prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in bacteremia after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy: a need for changing preventive protocol [^112QLykA]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether the incidence of bacteremia after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUSGPB) significantly diminishes with the setting up of a new preventive protocol. This protocol was set up after detecting an augmented incidence of bacteremia after TRUSGPB with a high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.

Methods

Retrospective descriptive and prospective intervention study performed at a University Hospital.

Participants

Patients undergoing TRUSGPB under the old preventive protocol (January 2006-February 2007), that is, amoxicillin-clavulanate 500 mg tid the day before, the day of the procedure, and 1 day after the procedure, and after setting up a new protocol (March 2007-April 2008), that is, 2 g cefoxitin 1 hour before the procedure and ciprofloxacin 750 mg p.o. bid the day before, the day of the procedure, and 3 days after the procedure; dipstick urinalysis was performed before the procedure, and patients with positive results were not biopsied.

Results

Incidence of bacteremia with old and new protocols: 9 of 204 procedures (4.4%) vs 2 of 207 (0.9%), (P = 0.03). Four isolates (44.4%) under the old protocol produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). With the new protocol, 2 (0.9%) cases of non-ESBL Escherichia coli bacteremia were observed. Sixty-five (23.8%) cases were not biopsied because of positive result of dipstick urinalysis, lack of antibiotic prophylaxis adherence, or altered coagulation parameters.

Conclusions

Antibiotic prophylaxis for TRUSGPB should take into account local resistance patterns. Cefoxitin could be used as prophylaxis in centers with high prevalence of ESBL enterobacteriaceae. Before TRUSGPB, excluding patients with positive results of dipstick urinalysis is an advisable practice.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^112VtasZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Enterobacterales at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production — third-generation cephalosporins and ceftriaxone use: Available data suggest that the emergence of resistance after ceftriaxone exposure occurs in approximately 20% of infections caused by E. cloacae, K. aerogenes, or C. freundii, and the panel suggests generally avoiding third-generation cephalosporins when treating infections caused by these organisms. Based on the mild nature of uncomplicated cystitis and the sufficient urinary excretion of ceftriaxone, ceftriaxone may be adequate therapy for the management of AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to ceftriaxone after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection, weighing the convenience of once-daily ceftriaxone dosing with the potentially increased risk of emergence of resistance.

### Positive culture for extended-spectrum β-lactamase during acute prostatitis after prostate biopsy is a risk factor for progression to chronic prostatitis [^114zNyyN]. Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze whether strains positive for extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) affected the clinical course and progression to chronic prostatitis in patients with postbiopsy acute prostatitis.

Methods

From 2002 to 2011, 3657 patients underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate, and 33 patients with acute prostatitis were enrolled. Acute prostatitis was defined as a fever greater than 38°C, pyuria, and tenderness on digital rectal examination. Urine and blood cultures were tested for antibiotic susceptibility. Laboratory and clinical variables according to the presence of ESBL were analyzed.

Results

Blood or urine culture was positive in 23 patients. The most common strain was Escherichia coli. Sixteen patients showed ESBL-positive and 18 patients were quinolone-resistant. Thirteen of 16 patients with ESBL-positive strains showed quinolone resistance, and 13 of 18 patients with quinolone resistance were ESBL-positive (P = 0.621). Besides imipenem, all ESBL-positive patients were susceptible to amikacin and were highly susceptible to cefoxitin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. The prevalence of ESBL-positive strains has tended to increase since 2006. Patients with ESBL had higher peak fever, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, and longer duration of fever and hospitalization. The progression rate to chronic prostatitis was significantly higher in ESBL-positive patients (4/16 vs 0/17, P = 0.044).

Conclusion

Since 2006, ESBL strains have been increasing, and the presence of ESBL showed more detrimental effects on the clinical course of the patients, resulting in a higher rate of progression to chronic prostatitis.

### The incidence of fluoroquinolone resistant infections after prostate biopsy – are fluoroquinolones still effective prophylaxis? [^1154YRq2]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Fluoroquinolones have been shown to decrease infective complications after prostate biopsy. However, fluoroquinolone resistance is emerging. We quantified contemporary rates of infective complications and the incidence of fluoroquinolone resistant infections after prostate biopsy under fluoroquinolone prophylaxis.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively evaluated the records of 1,273 patients who underwent prostate biopsy at New York Harbor Veterans Affairs Hospital from January 2004 to December 2006. Patients received levofloxacin or gatifloxacin. Using the Veterans Affairs computerized patient record system we reviewed all patient visits within 1 month after prostate biopsy. Visits were queried for infective symptoms. Positive cultures were evaluated for resistance patterns. The annual and overall incidence of infective complications and fluoroquinolone resistant infections was calculated.

Results

Of 1,273 patients 31 (2.4%) presented with infective symptoms after biopsy. The overall incidence of fluoroquinolone resistant infections was 1.2% (15 cases). When stratified by year, there were statistically significant increases in the incidence of infective complications and fluoroquinolone resistance from 2004 to 2006. Of the positive cultures those from 89% of patients yielded Escherichia coli and 90% were fluoroquinolone resistant. Fluoroquinolone resistant E. coli were also resistant to gentamicin in 22% of cases, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in 44%, piperacillin in 72% and ampicillin in 94%. However, 100% sensitivity was demonstrated for amikacin, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.

Conclusions

Fluoroquinolones are still effective as antibiotic prophylaxis for prostate biopsies but there is an increase in infective complications and fluoroquinolone resistance. When patients present with post-prostate biopsy infective symptoms, almost 50% are associated with fluoroquinolone resistant pathogens. Empirical treatment with ceftriaxone, ceftazidime or amikacin should be initiated until culture specific therapy can be implemented.

### Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli, a common human pathogen: challenges for vaccine development and progress in the field [^115gEVN9]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE: AN IMMINENT GLOBAL EMERGENCY

Resistance mechanisms to all major antibiotic classes exist among E. coli strains. These include the production of ESBLs, including TEM, SHV, CMY, and CTX-M types, and carbapenemases (NDM-1 and OXA-48 types). Currently, CTX-M-15 is the most prevalent ESBL among ExPEC. Resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides occurs via plasmid- or chromosomally encoded transferases or via mechanisms that reduce antimicrobial uptake into the cell. Rapid dissemination of newly resistant ExPEC clones, including E. coli O25b:ST131, are known to lead to localized outbreaks of extraintestinal disease.

Antibiotic-resistant E. coli strains are increasingly prevalent. In Europe, the population-weighted mean percentage of resistant E. coli isolates was 11.8% for third-generation cephalosporins and 22.3% for fluoroquinolones (data are from 2012). MDR (resistance to ≥ 3 antibiotic classes) made up 4.4% of all European isolates in 2012. In the United States, 31.3% of E. coli isolates among hospitalized patients (during 2007–2010) were fluoroquinolone resistant. In India, the prevalence of MDR E. coli has been reported to be as high as 76% among inpatients with UTIs.

Antibiotic resistance frequently leads to treatment failure; increased rates of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality; and increased associated healthcare and societal costs. Increasing antimicrobial resistance coupled with the current lack of truly novel antimicrobial agents is rapidly emerging as a major threat to human health and development, with direct effects on global productivity. A United Kingdom Prime Minister review committee estimated that 50 000 deaths in the United Kingdom and United States are caused by antibiotic-resistant infections annually. Antibiotic-resistant E. coli infections already account for one half of the estimated global burden caused by antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic-resistant ExPEC is fueling increases in hospitalization rates for UTI and increases in infectious complications after prostatic biopsy and is a risk factor for poor outcome in patients with bacteremia. Increasing rates of infectious complications after prostatic biopsy documented in several countries are thought to be due, in part, to increasing E. coli antibiotic resistance.

### Incidence and management of extended-spectrum β-lactamase and quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli infections after prostate biopsy [^114b64bx]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an overview of the incidence, bacteriologic characteristics, and antimicrobial resistance in acute prostatitis after transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed the medical records of 9568 patients who underwent TRUS-guided biopsy between March 1995 and May 2013. These patients received oral quinolone and/or cephalosporin and intramuscular aminoglycoside as antibiotic prophylaxis. In patients with acute prostatitis, blood and urine cultures were obtained on hospital admission. The incidences of acute prostatitis and antimicrobial resistance were examined according to time period.

Results

A total of 11,345 cases of TRUS-guided biopsy were performed for 9568 patients. Acute prostatitis developed in 103 patients (0.91%). In 63 patients, the causative organism was isolated from blood and/or urine culture. The most frequent etiologic organism was Escherichia coli, which was present in 47 of 49 patients (95.9%) in blood and from 39 of 41 patients (95.1%) in urine. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E coli were detected continuously since 2008 and found in 10 patients (21.3%) in blood and 8 patients (20.5%) in urine. Forty-four patients (93.6%) in blood and 36 patients (92.3%) in urine of the positive cultures and all cases with ESBL-producing E coli infection showed resistance to quinolone. ESBL-producing E coli were susceptible to imipenem, amikacin, and cefoxitin.

Conclusion

In the treatment of acute prostatitis after TRUS-guided biopsy, quinolone is not an effective antimicrobial of choice. We should take into account antimicrobial-resistant patterns because of the high prevalence of quinolone resistance and emergence of an ESBL-producing strain.

Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Transrectal prostate biopsy — prophylactic antibiotics have been shown to be of benefit only for this percutaneous biopsy, with a lower rate of bacteriuria (6 of 227; 3%) after a single dose of ciprofloxacin compared with no prophylaxis (19 of 268; 8%); agents targeting enteric organisms are recommended, including fluoroquinolones, first‑, second‑, or third‑generation cephalosporins, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole; because fluoroquinolone‑resistant E. coli now occurs in the rectum of more than 20% of males, the addition of an IV aminoglycoside such as gentamycin is advised; broad‑spectrum agents should be avoided due to resistance risk, and bowel preparations should not be used.

### Efficacy of fosfomycin compared to second generation cephalosporin flumarin as antimicrobial prophylaxis for transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy: a single center retrospective study [^112QpxKK]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The current study aimed to identify the efficacy of fosfomycin compared with flumarin in terms of the incidence of infectious complications after TRUS-guided prostate biopsy. As most clinical trials studying the efficacy of fosfomycin as antimicrobial prophylaxis for TRUS-guided prostate biopsy compared fosfomycin with fluoroquinolones, we conducted this study to compare fosfomycin with a second-generation cephalosporin. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been done previously. Both were not commonly used as antimicrobial prophylaxis agents in TRUS-guided prostate biopsy as fluoroquinolones have been the main recommended choice of antimicrobial prophylaxis agents for TRUS-guided prostate biopsy for decades. However, the increase in infectious complications after TRUS-guided prostate biopsy mainly due to increased fluoroquinolone resistance and restricted use of fluoroquinolones by the European Commission in 2019 has prompted the guidelines to recommend alternative strategies for antimicrobial prophylaxis for TRUS-guided prostate biopsy. This includes targeted prophylaxis based on rectal swab, augmented prophylaxis, and alternative antibiotics like fosfomycin and cephalosporins, both of which were used in our series.

One of the difficulties when selecting an optimal agent for antimicrobial prophylaxis is the geographical variation of antimicrobial resistance. Knowledge of local antimicrobial resistance pattern is therefore paramount in this selection process. Our hospital had been using flumarin as our main antimicrobial prophylaxis agent for TRUS-guided prostate biopsy since 2009 until 2019 when we switched to fosfomycin. Although there is no restriction in South Korea with the use of fluoroquinolones like the one implemented in Europe in 2019, reported fluoroquinolone resistance rate has been high. Antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli to ciprofloxacin in South Korea was 84.8% in a study from 2003. This figure had decreased progressively over time; the susceptibility rate was 76.6% in a study from 2008, 74.6% in a study from 2011, and 69.8% in a study from 2013. Using fluoroquinolones, as recommended by the guidelines at the time, might have caused detrimental effects on patients undergoing TRUS-guided prostate biopsy. One report has suggested that if local resistance of E. coli to fluoroquinolones is greater than 20%, alternative antibiotics should be considered. Resistance rates to cephalosporins were all under 20% in studies mentioned above. As such, we have been using second-generation cephalosporin flumarin as our main antimicrobial prophylaxis for TRUS-guided biopsy for more than 10 years.

### Ceftriaxone (Easy-ceft) [^1176hGec]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Before instituting treatment with Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP, appropriate specimens should be obtained for isolation of the causative organism and for determination of its susceptibility to the drug. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining results of susceptibility testing.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP is indicated for the treatment of the following infections when caused by susceptible organisms:

LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS

LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis or Serratia marcescens.

ACUTE BACTERIAL OTITIS MEDIA

ACUTE BACTERIAL OTITIS MEDIA caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophi/us influenzae (including beta-lactamase producing strains) or Moraxella catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase producing strains).

NOTE: In one study lower clinical cure rates were observed with a single dose of Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP compared to 10 days of oral therapy. In a second study comparable cure rates were observed between single dose Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP and the comparator. The potentially lower clinical cure rate of Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP should be balanced against the potential advantages of parenteral therapy (see CLINICAL STUDIES).

URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS

URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS (complicated and uncomplicated) caused by Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii or Klebsiella pneumoniae.

UNCOMPLICATED GONORRHEA

UNCOMPLICATED GONORRHEA (cervical/urethral and rectal) caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including both penicillinase- and nonpenicillinase-producing strains, and pharyngeal gonorrhea caused by nonpenicillinase-producing strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE

PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP, like other cephalosporins, has no activity against Chlamydia trachomatis. Therefore, when cephalosporins are used in the treatment of patients with pelvic inflammatory disease and Chlamydia trachomatis is one of the suspected pathogens, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added.

### Reduced risk of sepsis after prostate biopsy using a cephalosporin-fluoroquinolone antibiotic regimen and isopropyl alcohol needle washing [^113W2Yaa]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare 3 prophylactic regimens to assess their impact on postbiopsy sepsis incidence.

Methods

Data were reviewed for 829 consecutive patients who underwent prostate biopsy in a community practice setting between January 2013 and October 2017. Group 1 patients received ciprofloxacin 500mg two times a day orally for 4 days starting the day prior to biopsy and gentamicin 80mg intramuscularly 20 minutes prior to biopsy. From April 2015 to October 2017, 2 groups of patients were followed in parallel in a randomized manner. Group 2 received ciprofloxacin 500mg two times a day orally for 4 days starting the day prior to biopsy and ceftriaxone 1g intramuscularly 20 minutes prior to biopsy. Group 3 received the same antibiotic regimen as group 2 and also underwent isopropyl alcohol needle washing.

Results

All study groups were demographically equivalent. Microscopic bacterial counts were substantially decreased after isopropyl alcohol needle washing. Incidence of postbiopsy sepsis in groups 1 (n = 313), 2 (n = 259), and 3 (n = 257) was 3.8%, 2%, and 0%, respectively (analysis of variance; p = 0.006). Risk factors for sepsis included elevated body mass index, Charlson Comorbidity Score, and presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Conclusion

There was a significant reduction in the incidence of sepsis after prostate biopsy using a combination of a ciprofloxacin-ceftriaxone antibiotic regimen and isopropyl alcohol needle washing. The technique for needle washing is inexpensive and quick, and can be easily adopted into current biopsy protocols.

Rectoprostatic gel spacer (RPS) — infection prevention. The panel does recommend that prophylactic antibiotics be administered prior to the implant procedure, especially in the case of prior infection following a transrectal ultrasound-directed prostate biopsy; a rectal swab may be helpful to ensure antibiotic sensitivity.

Both studies reported only on histology end points at the time of diagnosis, rather than health outcomes on follow-up. Prophylactic antibiotics, especially fluoroquinolones, are often used before transrectal needle biopsies. There are reports of increasing rates of sepsis, particularly with fluoroquinolone-resistant. Escherichia coli, and hospitalization after the procedure. Therefore, men undergoing transrectal biopsy should be told to seek medical attention immediately if they experience fever after biopsy. Preliminary data from a retrospective cohort of 8, 669 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer treated with either radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy suggested that short posttreatment PSA doubling time fulfills some criteria as a surrogate end point for all-cause mortality and prostate cancer-specific mortality after surgery or radiation therapy.

Likewise, a retrospective analysis showed PSA declines of 20% to 40% at 3 months and 30% or more at 2 months after initiation of chemotherapy for hormone-independent prostate cancer, and fulfilled several criteria of surrogacy for overall survival. These observations should be independently confirmed in prospective study designs and may not apply to patients treated with hormonal therapy. In addition, there are no standardized criteria of surrogacy or standardized cut points for adequacy of surrogate end points, even in prospective trials. Follow-up after radical prostatectomy After radical prostatectomy, a detectable PSA level identifies patients at elevated risk of local treatment failure or metastatic disease; however, a substantial proportion of patients with an elevated or rising PSA level after surgery remain clinically free of symptoms for extended periods.

Biochemical evidence of failure on the basis of elevated or slowly rising PSA alone, therefore, may not be sufficient to initiate additional treatment. For example, in a retrospective analysis of nearly 2, 000 men who had undergone radical prostatectomy with curative intent and were followed for a mean of 5. 3 years, 315 men demonstrated an abnormal PSA of
0. 2 ng/mL or higher, which is considered evidence of biochemical recurrence. Among these 315 men, 103 developed clinical evidence of recurrence. The median time to the development of clinical metastasis after biochemical recurrence was 8 years. After the men developed metastatic disease, the median time to death was an additional 5 years.

### Prostate cancer, nutrition, and dietary supplements-NCI… [^1147Gmm4]. NCI (2012). Low credibility.

CAM treatments have been studied to see if their use lowers the risk of prostate cancer, kills prostate cancer cells, or lowers the risk that cancer will come back after treatment. Most of these studies used prostate-specific antigen levels to find out whether the treatment worked. This is a weaker measure of how well the treatment works than direct measures, such as fewer new cases of prostate cancer, or smaller tumor size or lower rate of recurrence after treatment for prostate cancer. Overview of CAM Use in Prostate Cancer Studies of CAM use to treat prostate cancer have shown the following: Also, most research has studied the effects of lycopene on the risk of all prostate cancers, and has not studied effects of lycopene on low-grade prostate cancer compared with high-grade prostate cancer. There is not enough evidence to know whether lycopene can prevent or treat prostate cancer.

For information on studies in people taking lycopene supplements or foods containing lycopene, see the Human Studies section of the health professional version of Prostate Cancer, Nutrition, and Dietary Supplements. Have any studies of MCP been done in people. Few studies have been done in men with prostate cancer. There is not enough evidence to know whether MCP has any effect on prostate cancer. Have any side effects or risks been reported from MCP. Side effects that have been reported include itching, upset stomach, abdominal cramps, increased gas, and diarrhea. In several large studies, men with high selenium levels were at greater risk of being diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer or dying from prostate cancer. Is selenium approved by the FDA for use as a cancer treatment in the United States. The FDA has not approved the use of selenium supplements for the treatment or prevention of cancer.

In a group of 26 studies, Vitamin D was reviewed for safety, how well it works, and whether it interacts with drugs used to treat prostate cancer and other tumors. The reviewers found the risk of side effects and interactions with other drugs to be low. Several studies looked at the safety of high-dose vitamin D and how well it works with chemotherapy to treat men with prostate cancer that did not respond to hormone therapy. The side effects that occurred after treatment with high-dose vitamin D and docetaxel were the same as the side effects noted after treatment with docetaxel alone. Is vitamin D approved by the FDA for use as a cancer treatme.
