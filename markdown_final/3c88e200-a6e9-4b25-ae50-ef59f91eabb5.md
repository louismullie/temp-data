## Question

Guaifenesin for cough with covid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether guaifenesin is effective for cough in COVID-19 and how to counsel on its use, including dosing, safety, and alternatives. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context of COVID-19 cough and whether it differs mechanistically from other viral URIs. Then, I should verify the pharmacology and labeled indications of guaifenesin. Next, I will review the quality and direction of clinical evidence for guaifenesin in acute viral cough, including any COVID-19–specific data. After that, I need to check guideline positions and expert reviews. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation with dosing, safety, and follow-up advice, and consider alternatives if guaifenesin is not appropriate or effective.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. COVID-19 cough is common, often productive early, and can persist for weeks to months in some patients; mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 can induce neurotropism and neuroinflammation that may heighten cough reflex sensitivity, which could influence how symptomatic therapies work, so I need to keep that pathophysiology in mind when judging expectorants versus antitussives [^114QiqFY] [^1158xo2S].

> I will now examine guaifenesin's pharmacology and labeling. Guaifenesin is an expectorant intended to increase sputum volume and reduce viscosity to facilitate expectoration; it is labeled for symptomatic relief of cough in adults and children aged 12 years and older, with typical dosing of 200–400 mg every 4 hours (max 2,400 mg/day) for immediate-release and 600–1,200 mg every 12 hours for extended-release formulations, which sets the framework for safe use if chosen [^111dsGWy] [^114h2ELZ] [^114xEycq].

> Next, I should review the clinical evidence base. Wait, let me verify the highest-quality syntheses first: CHEST's expert panel found only three small, low-quality trials of guaifenesin versus placebo in acute URTI with conflicting results and no pediatric data, and Cochrane reviews similarly conclude there is no good evidence for or against OTC cough medicines, including expectorants, in acute cough; importantly, a well-conducted 8-day RCT measuring sputum rheology and volume found no significant effect of extended-release guaifenesin on sputum properties or volume versus placebo, which challenges its core mechanism in acute RTI [^113DVV9q] [^113Hr835] [^1137Saus].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check for signals from physiologic or patient-reported endpoints. Small studies suggest guaifenesin may modestly reduce cough reflex sensitivity in acute viral URI, but these are limited by size, heterogeneity, and lack of replication; a single-dose study showed no improvement in mucociliary or cough clearance, and patient-reported outcome studies of extended-release guaifenesin show mixed results with signals around day 4 that often fade by day 8 and may reflect natural illness trajectory rather than true drug effect, so the overall clinical relevance remains uncertain [^114VmyRt] [^112DMuh9] [^112zn1Jd] [^115q4CEi].

> I need to check whether any COVID-19–specific trials exist. I should confirm this carefully: I do not find randomized trials of guaifenesin specifically for COVID-19 cough, and major COVID-19 guidelines do not address guaifenesin as a recommended therapy, which means any recommendation here must extrapolate from general acute viral cough data and mechanistic plausibility rather than direct COVID-19 evidence [^113vVjzw].

> Let me consider guideline positions and expert reviews. CHEST and Cochrane highlight the lack of convincing benefit for expectorants in acute URTI cough, and contemporary expert reviews question guaifenesin's effectiveness as an expectorant in this context; for persistent post-COVID cough, ESCMID notes insufficient evidence to recommend for or against most interventions, reinforcing that we should avoid overpromising benefit where data are sparse [^113DVV9q] [^113Hr835] [^112mwPV3] [^113vVjzw].

> Now, I should synthesize the risk–benefit profile. Mechanistically, guaifenesin is reasonable for tenacious, productive mucus, but high-quality evidence has not demonstrated consistent improvements in sputum properties or clinically meaningful cough outcomes; benefits, if present, are likely small and may be indistinguishable from placebo in many patients, whereas the safety profile is generally favorable with mostly mild GI effects reported, so the main risk is false reassurance and delayed evaluation of a worsening cough [^1137Saus] [^114V8vXF] [^111tMc7H].

> Let me translate this into practical counseling. For adults with mild COVID-19 and productive cough, a cautious, time-limited trial of guaifenesin is reasonable if the patient prefers, using immediate-release 200–400 mg every 4 hours or extended-release 600–1,200 mg every 12 hours, not exceeding 2,400 mg/day, with attention to hydration and airway clearance techniques; I should confirm age eligibility (≥ 12 years per labeling) and avoid use in patients with hypersensitivity or those who cannot tolerate increased sputum production [^114h2ELZ] [^114xEycq] [^111UDS22].

> But wait, what if the cough is dry or the patient is not bringing up mucus? I should clarify that guaifenesin is unlikely to help nonproductive coughs, and in such cases nonpharmacologic measures or a different class of therapy may be preferable; if cough persists beyond about 7 days, worsens, or is accompanied by fever, rash, or persistent headache, I need to ensure the patient stops use and seeks medical evaluation to exclude complications or alternate diagnoses per OTC labeling guidance [^114pJPVw].

> I should confirm pediatric considerations. For children under 12 years, guaifenesin is not covered by the OTC labeling used here, and evidence for any OTC cough medication in children is limited; honey has some supportive data for acute pediatric cough, and nonpharmacologic measures are generally emphasized given the lack of proven benefit and potential harms with some OTC agents [^114h2ELZ] [^116nECM8].

> Next, I should review alternatives and special situations. Nonpharmacologic strategies such as hydration, humidified air, and honey (for children older than 1 year) are reasonable; in patients with severe or distressing cough where benefits outweigh risks, a short course of a prescription opioid antitussive may be considered in adults, but I need to screen for substance use risk, respiratory comorbidity, and follow strict monitoring plans if using combinations like hydrocodone–guaifenesin, which carry boxed warnings and should be reserved for carefully selected adults after assessing etiology and safer options [^1157BeLG] [^115VM4E1] [^112JDaRv].

> In summary, I should be transparent: guaifenesin may offer modest, variable symptomatic relief for productive cough in acute viral illness, but high-quality evidence has not demonstrated consistent benefit on sputum properties or clinically important outcomes, and there are no COVID-19–specific efficacy data; therefore, it is reasonable to try for a short period with clear stop criteria, while prioritizing hydration, nonpharmacologic measures, and timely reassessment if cough persists or red flags arise [^1137Saus] [^113DVV9q] [^114pJPVw].

---

Guaifenesin is **not recommended for COVID-19 cough** because there is **no evidence of benefit** in COVID-19 and only limited, low-quality data in general acute cough [^113DVV9q] [^113Hr835]. It may modestly reduce cough reflex sensitivity in viral URIs [^114VmyRt], but **does not improve sputum volume or properties** in acute RTIs [^1137Saus] [^112DMuh9]. Use standard dosing if tried (IR 200–400 mg q4h or ER 600–1,200 mg q12h; max 2,400 mg/day) [^114h2ELZ] [^114xEycq], and stop if cough persists > 7 days or worsens [^114pJPVw]. Consider honey, hydration, or a humidifier first; avoid opioid-containing combinations due to risks [^115VM4E1].

## Evidence for guaifenesin in COVID-19 cough

There is **no direct evidence** from randomized trials or guidelines supporting guaifenesin for COVID-19 cough [^notfound]. Available data are from non-COVID acute viral URIs and are limited and inconsistent [^113Hr835].

---

## Clinical studies and guidelines

- **CHEST 2017**: Systematic review of 3 small trials (304 subjects) found very low-quality, conflicting results; no pediatric data [^113DVV9q].
- **Cochrane 2014**: No good evidence for or against OTC cough medicines, including guaifenesin, in acute cough [^113Hr835].
- **COVID-19 guidelines**: IDSA and WHO do not mention guaifenesin for cough management [^notfound].

---

## Mechanism of action and relevance to COVID-19 cough

Guaifenesin is an expectorant that increases sputum volume and reduces viscosity to aid clearance [^111dsGWy]. However, in acute RTIs it **did not change sputum volume or properties** versus placebo, questioning its expectorant effect in this setting [^1137Saus] [^112DMuh9]. COVID-19 cough often reflects neurotropism and neuroinflammation with cough hypersensitivity, which guaifenesin does not target [^114QiqFY].

---

## Clinical efficacy and safety

Efficacy is limited and inconsistent; some studies suggest a modest reduction in cough reflex sensitivity in viral URIs [^114VmyRt], but **no consistent benefit** on cough frequency, severity, or quality of life has been demonstrated [^113DVV9q] [^113Hr835]. Safety is generally favorable, with mild GI effects (nausea, vomiting) and rare dizziness, headache, or rash [^114V8vXF] [^111tMc7H].

---

## Recommended dosing and administration

If used, follow standard OTC dosing; **do not exceed labeled maximums**:

| **Formulation** | **Dose** | **Frequency** | **Maximum daily dose** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Immediate-release | 200–400 mg | Every 4 hours | 2,400 mg [^114h2ELZ] |
| Extended-release | 600–1,200 mg | Every 12 hours | 2,400 mg [^117HFo4t] |

---

Stop use and seek care if cough persists > 7 days, recurs, or is accompanied by fever, rash, or persistent headache [^114pJPVw].

---

## Comparison with other cough treatments

- **Honey**: Supported for pediatric acute cough; safe and effective in RCTs [^116zx6CN].
- **Hydration and humidification**: Nonpharmacologic mainstays for symptom relief.
- **Opioid-containing combinations (e.g. hydrocodone/guaifenesin)**: Not recommended due to risks of respiratory depression, misuse, and lack of superior efficacy [^114tgLkd].

---

## Current clinical recommendations

Given the lack of COVID-19–specific evidence and limited general data, guaifenesin is **not recommended** for COVID-19 cough. Management should prioritize nonpharmacologic measures and evidence-based supportive care [^113DVV9q] [^113vVjzw].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

There are **no registered trials** specifically evaluating guaifenesin for COVID-19 cough. Future research should test mucoactive agents in COVID-19 using validated patient-reported outcomes and objective sputum measures [^notfound].

---

Guaifenesin **lacks supportive evidence** for COVID-19 cough and is not guideline-recommended. Use nonpharmacologic measures first; if guaifenesin is tried, use standard dosing and reassess promptly if symptoms persist or worsen.

Guaifenesin, a widely used ingredient in over-the-counter cough and cold medications, has been a subject of debate regarding its efficacy in treating respiratory conditions. Despite its historical use and US Food and Drug Administration approval, recent studies have questioned its claimed expectorant effect and its effectiveness in managing symptoms. This article examines the available evidence, highlighting the lack of significant benefits over placebo for upper respiratory disease. The rationale for clinical use is examined alongside the potential downside and alternatives to recommending guaifenesin as a treatment option.

### Patient-reported outcomes to assess the efficacy of extended-release guaifenesin for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infection symptoms [^113iFr8X]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

For the SSSA, participants rated the severity of chest congestion, mucus thickness, and coughing on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 equal to "none" and 5 equal to "as bad as it can be".

The WURSS-21 was used to assess disease-specific changes in quality of life parameters during the study. This tool was included as it is a validated PRO for the assessment of quality of life changes in colds. The WURSS-21 includes one global severity item, 10 symptom-based items, nine functional items, and one global change item. The questionnaire was completed at baseline (before treatment), pre dose on Days 3 and 4 and at the Day 8 end of study visit.

On Day 8 of the study, participants completed the Patient's End-of-Treatment Assessment. Participants provided an overall rating of the efficacy of the treatment in relieving symptoms associated with their infection by responding to the question: "Was the study medication effective?", Possible responses were: 0 = not effective at all, 1 = somewhat effective, 2 = moderately effective, 3 = very effective, 4 = extremely effective.

Also on Day 8, investigators completed the Investigator's (Healthcare Professional; HCP) End-of-Study Assessment by responding "yes" or "no" to the question: "Based on the observed treatment outcomes for this patient, would you recommend the study medication for future use for the treatment of symptoms associated with an acute respiratory infection in this type of patient?".

Objective measures of efficacy including sputum rheology, interfacial tension, and sputum volume were also assessed (not reported here). Safety assessments were performed by the investigator or investigational site personnel and consisted of assessment of vital signs and oral temperature and collection of adverse event (AE) information.

Methods

Clinical pilot study

Study design and objectives

The clinical pilot study was a multicenter, randomized, parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the effects of 1200 mg ER guaifenesin (Mucinex), dosed every 12 hours for 7 days, on symptoms (using subjective measures) and sputum properties (using objective measures) in subjects with an acute URTI. The secondary objective was to determine the safety and tolerability of ER guaifenesin in this patient population.

Another key objective was to explore clinical endpoints and methods for potential follow-up studies. Exploratory analyses were conducted on composite subsets of questions chosen from among the 11 questions in the Daily Cough and Phlegm Diary (DCPD); the objective was to search for more sensitive efficacy endpoints and/or criteria to help identify a more refined patient population to better discriminate between active and placebo treatments in acute URTI patient studies. The 11-item DCPD consisted of an 8-question diary symptom subscale and 3 social function questions.

The pilot study protocol was submitted for independent ethical review, and approval was obtained in writing from the institutional review board (IRB), Quorum Review Inc. (Seattle, WA, USA). The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the harmonized tripartite guideline E6 (R1) of the International Conference on Harmonisation, Good Clinical Practice, the Declaration of Helsinki, Title 21 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations, and applicable national, state, and local laws or regulations. All participants (or parents or legally authorized representatives) were required to provide written informed consent before starting the study.

Results

Clinical pilot study

Patient population

A total of 378 participants with a mean age of 41.0 ± 14.47 years (range 13.0 − 85.0 years) were randomly assigned to treatment (all-patient population) and 366 participants completed the study (Figure 1). There were 369 patients in the mITT population and 377 patients in the safety population. The treatments were well balanced with respect to demographics and baseline characteristics (Table 1).

Efficacy evaluation

The sample size was selected to look for indications and trends without the expectation of seeing p-values of < 0.05. Any achievement of these values was considered a very strong signal.

In general, subjective measures of efficacy at Day 4 showed the most prominent difference between treatment groups. Analysis of total scores showed no significant differences. However, analysis of individual questions from the DCPD and SSSA showed several statistically significant differences between treatment groups for questions relating to cough, in favor of ER guaifenesin in the mITT population (Tables 2 and 3). Significant differences also noted on Days 5 and 7 (Table 2). Although the main cluster of efficacy signals was around Days 4/5, there were also signs of an early onset of effect at earlier time points.

Background

Guaifenesin is a component of medicines used to improve symptoms associated with upper respiratory tract infections. Patient-reported outcome instruments are valuable for evaluating symptom improvements; however, a validated tool to assess efficacy of mucoactive drugs does not exist. We compared the efficacy of extended-release guaifenesin with placebo for treatment of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection using subjective efficacy assessments in a pilot study and confirmed precision of assessments in a validation study.

Methods

The pilot study was a randomized, double-blind study where patients were dosed with either 1200 mg extended-release guaifenesin (n = 188) or placebo (n = 190), every 12 hours for 7 days. Efficacy was assessed using subjective measures including the Daily Cough and Phlegm Diary, the Spontaneous Symptom Severity Assessment and the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey. End-of-study assessments were completed by patients and investigator. The validation study consisted of two phases. In Phase I, subjects completed interviews to gather evidence to support the content validity of the Daily Cough and Phlegm Diary, the Spontaneous Symptom Severity Assessment and Patient's End-of-Treatment Assessment. Phase II examined the psychometric properties of assessments evaluated in Phase I of the validation study using data from the pilot study.

Results

Subjective measures of efficacy at Day 4 showed the most prominent difference between treatment groups, in favor of guaifenesin. The 8-symptom related questions (SUM8) in the Daily Cough and Phlegm Diary, analyzed as a composite score appeared to be the strongest candidate endpoint for further evaluation. Results from the interviews in Phase I supported the content of the assessments which were validated during Phase II. Treatments were well tolerated.

Conclusions

Results from the clinical pilot and validation studies showed that the SUM8 diary scores were robust and reliable for use as efficacy endpoints in studies of mucoactive drugs.

Trial registration

The study was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01046136).

### Patient-reported outcomes to assess the efficacy of extended-release guaifenesin for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infection symptoms [^117HFo4t]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment

Volunteers were randomized to take either two 600 mg ER guaifenesin or two matching placebo tablets every 12 hours with a full glass of water for seven consecutive days. The dose and duration were chosen to be consistent with the Mucinexproduct labeling, with 2400 mg being the maximum daily dose approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Other OTC cough, cold, or allergy medicines were not permitted.

The first dose of study medication was taken at the clinic on Day 1 (following a 24-hour washout period if required). Subsequent doses were taken at home, except on Days 3 and 4 when patients took the morning dose at the investigational site. No specific instructions were given to the participants for the timing of the doses with respect to meals.

Assessments

PROs of efficacy, self-completed by patients, included the DCPD (Days 1–8 [or end of study]), the SSSA (Days 1, 3, 4, 8 [or end of study]) and the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-21) (Days 1, 3, 4, 8 [or end of study]).

For the DCPD, participants rated changes in symptoms daily during the study including phlegm, cough, and lifestyle effects by answering 11 questions with one of five possible answers. Seven questions had possible responses of "never", "rarely", "sometimes", "often", or "always"; remaining questions had possible responses of "not at all", "a little", "somewhat", "quite a bit", or "extremely".

### Effect of guaifenesin on cough reflex sensitivity [^114VmyRt]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Guaifenesin, a commonly used agent for the treatment of cough, is termed an expectorant since it is believed to alleviate cough discomfort by increasing sputum volume and decreasing its viscosity, thereby promoting effective cough. Despite its common usage, relatively few studies, yielding contrasting results, have been performed to investigate the action and efficacy of guaifenesin.

Study Objectives

To evaluate the effect of guaifenesin on cough reflex sensitivity.

Design

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

Academic medical center.

Participants

Fourteen subjects with acute viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI) and 14 healthy volunteers.

Interventions

On 2 separate days, subjects underwent capsaicin cough challenge 1 to 2 h after receiving a single, 400-mg dose (capsules) of guaifenesin or matched placebo.

Measurements and Results

The concentration of capsaicin inducing five or more coughs (C(5)) was determined. Among subjects with URI, mean (± SEM) log C(5) after guaifenesin and placebo were 0.92 ± 0.17 and 0.66 ± 0.14, respectively (p = 0.028). No effect on cough sensitivity was observed in healthy volunteers.

Conclusions

Our results demonstrate that guaifenesin inhibits cough reflex sensitivity in subjects with URI, whose cough receptors are transiently hypersensitive, but not in healthy volunteers. Possible mechanisms include a central antitussive effect, or a peripheral effect by increased sputum volume serving as a barrier shielding cough receptors within the respiratory epithelium from the tussive stimulus.

Discussion

Expectorants are an important and widely used component of treatment for relief of the symptoms of acute URTIs. Currently the main assessments used to assess mucoactive therapies include quality of life questionnaires; however, there is a need for a universally accepted, sensitive, clinically relevant and appropriately validated PRO measure for use as the primary efficacy outcome measure in future clinical trials in this field.

The clinical pilot study reported here is unique in the field of guaifenesin research and was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of ER guaifenesin compared with placebo in patients with productive cough due to an acute URTI. In addition, together with the validation study, the research was conducted to support the selection of primary endpoints for future clinical studies of mucoactive compounds.

The subjective measures of efficacy in this study showed the most prominent difference between groups at Day 4 but there were also some improvements at earlier time points. In agreement with the mode of action of ER guaifenesin and current labeling in the United States, the most significant symptom improvements were seen with cough and several discomforts associated with excess and tenacious mucus.

The rating of effects on mucus in the SSSA showed a strong trend throughout the course of treatment but did not quite meet statistical significance at the p < 0.05 level. Nevertheless, the consistency of the signal over the course of treatment supports the concept of a steady effect of ER guaifenesin on airway mucus; this is the mechanism by which guaifenesin improves mucus-related symptoms as reported in questions 2, 5 and 8 of the DCPD.

Subject selection

Male and female volunteers aged ≥ 12 years were recruited from 12 sites in the United States if they had symptoms of an acute URTI diagnosed by the investigator within 5 days of onset. Study investigators were family physicians and specialists in asthma/allergy, otolaryngology and emergency medicine. The inclusion criteria required volunteers to have symptoms of moderate or greater severity for two of three symptoms of cough, thickened mucus or chest congestion as measured by the Spontaneous Symptom Severity Assessment (SSSA) score; have developed productive cough within 72 hours prior to dosing on Day 1, and be able to expectorate sputum. Volunteers were included if they met the above criteria, were otherwise healthy as determined by medical history and physical examination (including vital signs), and if the investigator felt they would be compliant and complete the study.

Volunteers were excluded from the study if they had chronic, recurring respiratory signs and symptoms due to allergic rhinitis or chronic bronchitis, asthma or wheezing; any significant disease of the heart, kidney, liver, lung, uncontrolled hypertension, or diabetes mellitus, cystic fibrosis or thyroid disorder; or any other disease which may have interfered with study outcomes or caused undue risk to the patient. Volunteers who had febrile illness (> 101°F) within 7 days or received 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine within 2 weeks of Day 1 were excluded. Pregnant or lactating women were excluded and females of childbearing age must have been using birth control for at least 3 months prior to the study; they were also required to provide a negative urine pregnancy test on Day 1.

Volunteers were not permitted to participate if they had taken part in another clinical investigation within 30 days before the baseline visit; had known hypersensitivity or allergy to guaifenesin or any product ingredients; were being treated with intranasal medications or systemic antihistamines, bronchodilators or decongestants; had used any over-the-counter (OTC) cough, cold, or allergy medication within 24 hours prior to Day 1 or had used a humidifier or any other inhaled aromatherapy from Day 1. Any volunteers who had received treatment with sleeping pills, sedatives, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, opioids, or antidepressants in the 7 days prior to Day 1, with the exception of chronic medications taken at a stable dose for at least 3 months or longer, were excluded as were those who had received systemic corticosteroids or antibiotics within the 4 weeks prior to Day 1.

### Patient-reported outcomes to assess the efficacy of extended-release guaifenesin for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infection symptoms [^114bdoCX]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

The DCPD includes 8-symptom related questions (SUM8) and three functional items that focus on phlegm and cough. Due to the fact that excess and tenacious airway mucus during URTIs is one of the triggers for cough, it also seems to be consistent that ER guaifenesin was associated with improvements in cough symptoms on Day 4 (p = 0.0293). This signal weakened and lost statistical significance towards Day 8 (p = 0.1158), which can be explained by the overall improvement of other cough triggers and disease dynamics of URTIs over time.

In this study the WURSS-21 score decreased at a similar rate and showed statistically significant between-day comparisons for both treatment groups. However, the WURSS-21 is a quality of life questionnaire designed to assess the negative impact of the many symptoms of the common cold rather than the symptomatic effects specific to mucus; therefore, it does not highlight the specific improvements associated with expectorant treatment. This suggests that this tool may not be suitable for future studies of guaifenesin.

For the Patient's End-of-Treatment Assessment of outcomes there was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups; however, it did show a trend favoring ER guaifenesin and the difference between treatments (9.6%) comes close to a meaningful therapeutic effect. The lack of a statistically significant difference between the treatment groups may have been due to a relatively small sample size and large placebo effect.

The Investigator's (HCP) End-of-Study Assessment significantly favored ER guaifenesin over placebo; although this outcome is not likely to be an appropriate primary measure of treatment efficacy it may be helpful in confirming some of the improvement in symptoms and could be considered as a secondary endpoint in future studies.

The clinical pilot study confirmed that treatment with ER guaifenesin was well tolerated in accordance with the well-documented safety profile and post-marketing surveillance of an over-the-counter ER, bilayer formulation of guaifenesin.

The mean duration of exposure was 7.0 (range 6 − 9) days in the ER guaifenesin group and 7.1 (range 0 − 18) days in the placebo group. The treatment was well tolerated and treatment-emergent AEs were reported in only 8.5% of patients in the ER guaifenesin group and 5.3% of patients in the placebo group (Table 5). Most events were mild in severity and resolved without intervention. None of the AEs were deemed definitely related to study medication and none of the study discontinuations were deemed to be due to AEs.

AE: adverse event. Note: The total number of AEs includes all treatment-emergent AEs for patients. Patients may have more than one treatment-emergent AE per system organ class and preferred term. At each level of patient summarization, a patient was counted once for the most related AE.

Validation study

A total of 12 participants were interviewed during Phase I. The mean age of the participants was 34.3 ± 9.7 years (range 24.0–50.0 years). Half of the participants were male and 58% were white, 25% black and 17% Asian. None of the participants reported having any existing health conditions and 92% were not on any medications (one participant reported using NuvaRing [Merck and Co, Inc. USA] birth control).

The results from the interviews in Phase I generally supported the content of the DCPD, the SSSA, and the Patient's End-of-Treatment Assessment. The open-ended questions revealed important symptoms of URTIs including cough (productive and non-productive), sputum, and chest congestion. All of the more specific items evaluated in the DCPD, such as difficulty bringing up phlegm and thickness of phlegm, were discussed as important symptoms associated with URTI.

### Guaifenesin [^111dsGWy]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Guaifenesin is an expectorant, the action of which promotes or facilitates the removal of secretions from the respiratory tract. By increasing sputum volume and making sputum less viscous, guaifenesin facilitates expectoration of retained secretions.

### Patient-reported outcomes to assess the efficacy of extended-release guaifenesin for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infection symptoms [^1131o7rK]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

All data collected were treated confidentially and all recorded interviews were transcribed and cross-checked. All quantitative data were double data entered and cleaned. A content analysis approach was used to analyze qualitative data from the interviews using ATLAS.ti analysis software (ATLAS.ti; version 5.0).

Validation psychometric evaluation (Phase II)

The objective of Phase II was to examine the psychometric properties of the DCPD, the SSSA items (cough, congestion, mucus), and the Patient's End-of-Treatment Assessment. Descriptive and instrument score characteristics, reliability, validity, and ability to detect change, and score interpretation of the PROs, consistent with current regulatory standards, were evaluated.

Phase II psychometric evaluations used blinded data, pooled across treatment groups, from the pilot clinical study (above) assessments conducted at Days 1, 4 and Day 8 or end of study. Statistical analyses were conducted in accordance with classical psychometric theory. Internal consistency reliability was evaluated with Cronbach's alpha statistic. Convergent validity was evaluated by examining the magnitude of correlations between the DCPD and conceptually related measures at the same assessment point.

### Patient-reported outcomes to assess the efficacy of extended-release guaifenesin for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infection symptoms [^115fGvnw]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Expectorants, such as guaifenesin, are a component of many cough and cold medicines that are used to improve mucociliary clearance and relieve chest congestion associated with acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs).

Objective measures and methods to assess the treatment effect of mucoactive products have been problematic and have shown inconsistent outcomes. For evaluating any improvement in symptoms of an URTI, patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments are a valuable method. However, during the clinical development of an extended-release (ER), bilayer formulation of guaifenesin (Mucinex, Reckitt Benckiser, Parsippany, NJ, USA), it became apparent that a universally accepted, validated PRO tool to assess the efficacy of mucoactive drugs does not exist.

The heterogeneous nature of URTIs and the daily changes that occur during the natural resolution of infections makes assessments of products to treat them challenging. There is also the placebo effect associated with cough studies, which has been well documented. The symptoms of URTIs are also highly subjective and PROs currently lack the precision to differentiate minimally important changes due to treatment from those occurring due to natural resolution of symptoms.

It is important from a regulatory perspective that any primary efficacy endpoint should be clinically relevant and appropriately validated. The US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency guidance for industry highlights the importance of using validated PRO measures when investigating new drugs.

In this manuscript we describe the results of a clinical pilot study where ER guaifenesin was compared with placebo for the treatment of symptoms of acute URTIs. We also report results from a validation study which consisted of two phases, used to confirm the precision of PROs used in the pilot study. The overarching objective of this pilot and validation research was to identify and subsequently verify suitable clinical instruments for measuring mucoactive treatment outcomes in future studies of patients with symptoms of acute URTIs.

### Patient-reported outcomes to assess the efficacy of extended-release guaifenesin for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infection symptoms [^113DzuAJ]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, the validation study showed that the SUM8 diary scores were robust and suitably reliable for use as efficacy endpoints in studies of expectorants such as guaifenesin for the symptoms of URTIs. Given the mechanism of action of ER guaifenesin and robust psychometric results for the SUM8, it is recommended that the 8-symptom related questions be prioritized for future efficacy studies.

Further improvements in the power of future studies will come from more targeted sample size estimates and further refinement of the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Future clinical studies with guaifenesin will confirm whether these are viable assessment tools and suitable primary outcome measures for the evaluation of the treatment of patients with URTIs.

### Inhibition of cough-reflex sensitivity by benzonatate and guaifenesin in acute viral cough [^112Fvu2W]. Respiratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Acute cough due to viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI) is the most common form of cough and accounts for tremendous expenditure on prescription and non-prescription cough products worldwide. However, few agents have been shown in properly conducted clinical trials to be effective for cough due to URI. The present study evaluated the effect of benzonatate 200mg (B), guaifenesin 600 mg (G), their combination (B+G), and placebo (P) on capsaicin-induced cough in 30 adult nonsmokers with acute URI. On 3 separate days within a 7-day period, 1h after ingesting randomly assigned study drug in a double-blind fashion, subjects underwent capsaicin cough challenge testing, which involved inhalation of incremental doubling concentrations of capsaicin until the concentration of capsaicin inducing 5 or more coughs (C(5)) was attained. Each subject received 3 of 4 possible study drugs. G (p = 0.01) but not B (p = NS) inhibited cough-reflex sensitivity (log C(5)) relative to P. The combination of B+G suppressed capsaicin-induced cough to a greater degree than B alone (p < 0.001) or G alone (p = 0.008). The mechanism by which the combination of B+G causes a potentiation of antitussive effect remains to be elucidated. Our results suggest that B+G may be an effective therapy for acute cough due to the common cold (URI).

### Over-the-counter (OTC) medications for acute cough in children and adults in community settings [^116zx6CN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common symptom. Non-prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are frequently recommended as a first-line treatment, but there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral OTC cough preparations for acute cough in children and adults in community settings.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 3 2014), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2014), CINAHL (January 2010 to March 2014), LILACS (January 2010 to March 2014), Web of Science (January 2010 to March 2014) and the UK Department of Health National Research Register (March 2010).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral OTC cough preparations with placebo in children and adults suffering from acute cough in community settings. We considered all cough outcomes; secondary outcomes of interest were adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened potentially relevant citations, extracted data and assessed study quality. We performed quantitative analysis where appropriate.

Main Results

Due to the small numbers of trials in each category, the limited quantitative data available and the marked differences between trials in terms of participants, interventions and outcome measurement, we felt that pooling of the results was inappropriate. We included 29 trials (19 in adults, 10 in children) involving 4835 people (3799 adults and 1036 children). All studies were placebo-controlled RCTs. However, assessment of the risk of bias of the included studies was limited by poor reporting, particularly for the earlier studies. In the adult studies, six trials compared antitussives with placebo and had variable results. Three trials compared the expectorant guaifenesin with placebo; one indicated significant benefit, whereas the other two did not. One trial found that a mucolytic reduced cough frequency and symptom scores. Two studies examined antihistamine-decongestant combinations and found conflicting results. Four studies compared other combinations of drugs with placebo and indicated some benefit in reducing cough symptoms. Three trials found that antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms. In the child studies, antitussives (data from three studies), antihistamines (data from three studies), antihistamine-decongestants (two studies) and antitussive/bronchodilator combinations (one study) were no more effective than placebo. No studies using expectorants met our inclusion criteria. The results of one trial favoured active treatment with mucolytics over placebo. One trial tested two paediatric cough syrups and both preparations showed a 'satisfactory response' in 46% and 56% of children compared to 21% of children in the placebo group. One new trial indicated that three types of honey were more effective than placebo over a three-day period. Twenty-one studies reported adverse effects. There was a wide range across studies, with higher numbers of adverse effects in participants taking preparations containing antihistamines and dextromethorphan.

Authors' Conclusions

The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution because the number of studies in each category of cough preparations was small. Availability, dosing and duration of use of over-the-counter cough medicines vary significantly in different countries. Many studies were poorly reported making assessment of risk of bias difficult and studies were also very different from each other, making evaluation of overall efficacy difficult. There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. This should be taken into account when considering prescribing antihistamines and centrally active antitussive agents in children; drugs that are known to have the potential to cause serious harm.

### Patient-reported outcomes to assess the efficacy of extended-release guaifenesin for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infection symptoms [^111n9qWn]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

Statistical methods

All efficacy endpoints were exploratory and given equal consideration. The study sought to enroll 375 participants to ensure that 300 completed the study. Efficacy assessments were carried out on both the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) and the per protocol (PP) populations. Data for the mITT population are reported here.

The mITT population included all participants randomly assigned to treatment who received at least one dose of study medication and who had at least one efficacy assessment after baseline; it included all participants even those who had taken disallowed medications. In the mITT analysis, discontinued participants and those with missing data were included using the last observation carried forward approach. All safety analyses were conducted on the safety population, which included all enrolled participants who received at least one dose of study medication (active or placebo).

Responses to DCPD questions at each post-baseline assessment were compared between treatment groups using ordinal logistic regression with terms in the model for treatment group, study center and baseline. Within-patient changes from baseline to each post baseline assessment were assessed within each treatment group using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. In addition, to search for more sensitive study endpoints and population characteristics for possible follow-up studies, several post hoc exploratory analyses were conducted on composite endpoints defined as sums over subsets of the DCPD, and on selected subsets of the mITT population. These analyses compared the treatment groups using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models for changes from baseline, with terms in the model for treatment group, study center, and baseline.

Responses to SSSA questions at each post-baseline assessment were compared between treatment groups using ordinal logistic regression with terms in the model for treatment group, study center, and baseline. Within-patient changes from baseline (pre-dose on Day 1) to pre-dose on Days 3 and 4 and to Day 8, and from pre-dose on Days 3 and 4 to 3 hours after dosing on the same days were assessed within each treatment group using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and compared between treatment groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.

### Patient-reported outcomes to assess the efficacy of extended-release guaifenesin for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infection symptoms [^115z64GW]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

The changes from baseline in each of the WURSS-21 assessments at each post-baseline day were compared between treatment groups using an ANCOVA with terms in the model for treatment group, study center, and baseline. Within-patient changes from baseline to each post-baseline assessment were assessed within each treatment group using a paired t test.

Responses to the Patient's End-of-Treatment Assessment and the Investigator's End-of-Study Assessment were compared between treatment groups using ordinal logistic regression with terms in the model for treatment group and study center. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 8.2 or higher.

Because of the exploratory nature of the study, no multiplicity adjustments were made. Further, this study was not sized or intended to achieve statistical significant results across the board.

Validation study

Study design and objectives

The validation study consisted of two phases: a content validity evaluation (Phase I) and a psychometric evaluation (Phase II). Phase I was a cross-sectional qualitative study in which each subject participated in a one-to-one qualitative interview, lasting approximately 1 hour. The objective of Phase I was to gather qualitative evidence to support the content validity of the DCPD (including the diary symptom subscale), the SSSA questions, and the Patient's End-of-Treatment Assessment (results to be reported elsewhere).

Ethical approval was obtained from the IRB prior to the initiation of any study procedures. The study was conducted in accordance to the Declaration of Helsinki and all applicable federal, state, and local laws or regulations. All volunteers were required to provide written informed consent before participating in the study.

### Guaifenesin has no effect on sputum volume or sputum properties in adolescents and adults with acute respiratory tract infections [^1137Saus]. Respiratory Care (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Guaifenesin (glyceryl guaiacolate ether [GGE]) has been studied as a cough suppressant and as an expectorant; however, published studies to date have failed to find a consistent benefit.

Methods

An 8-day multi-center clinical trial was conducted to study the effect of two 600-mg extended-release GGE tablets twice daily for 1 week on cold symptoms, sputum volume, and properties in adolescents and adults with productive cough from an acute respiratory tract infection (RTI). The study enrolled 378 subjects (GGE, n = 188; and placebo, n = 190) who were otherwise healthy and had an RTI for up to 5 days before enrollment. Subjects suffered from at least 2 of 3 symptoms of cough, thickened mucus, and chest congestion. A total of 151 GGE and 144 control subjects completed the full protocol. Single-sputum samples were collected from each subject on days 1, 3, 4, and 8 of the study. The rheology and interfacial tension of sputum were measured, and 24-h collected samples from days 1 and 4 were analyzed for total volume and hydration.

Results

Symptoms in both the GGE and placebo groups improved to a similar degree over time. There were no significant differences between the GGE and placebo groups for sputum volume (P = 0.41), percent solids (P = 0.69), interfacial tension (P = 0.88), elasticity (P = 0.71), viscosity (P = 0.45), or mechanical impedance (P = 0.75).

Conclusions

The recommended dose of GGE had no measurable effect on sputum volume or properties and is unlikely to be an expectorant or mucolytic when used to treat acute RTI. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT01046136.).

### Patient-reported outcomes to assess the efficacy of extended-release guaifenesin for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infection symptoms [^111RoMn2]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

Diary items were generally well understood by the participants, were easy for participants to respond to and were highly relevant. There were, however, some minor inconsistencies in participants' interpretation of terminology; for example, phlegm was considered to be an ambiguous term. Similar results were found for the SSSA items and the Patient's End-of-Treatment Assessment items, which were well understood but required some further explanation around selected terms.

A total of 322 patients with baseline data were included in the analysis during Phase II. The mean age of the participants was 41.9 ± 14.4 years (range 13.0–85.0 years). Sex was approximately equally split (males, 53.1%; females, 46.9% and the majority of patients were white (55.9%) or black (39.1%) along with 3.4% Asian patients.

Data were excluded from one site which had "questionable practices" (n = 19) and from some patients who were provided the wrong questionnaire (n = 37).

Cronbach's alpha estimates for the SUM8 score were excellent, with estimates exceeding 0.70 at every time point (Table 6). Validity estimates demonstrated good convergent, discriminant, and known group's validity (Table 7).

### Over-the-counter medications for acute cough in children and adults in ambulatory settings [^114tgLkd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common symptom. Many health practitioners recommend non-prescription over-the-counter (OTC) medicines as a first-line treatment for cough, but there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral over-the-counter cough preparations for acute cough.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group specialised register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the UK Department of Health National Research Register and reference lists of articles. We wrote to study investigators and pharmaceutical companies for information on further published or unpublished studies. There were no constraints based on language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral OTC cough preparations with placebo in children and adults suffering from acute cough in ambulatory settings. We considered all cough outcomes (such as frequency and severity, continuous and categorical data, using different ways of measurement). The second outcomes of interest were adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two investigators screened potentially relevant citations independently. Any differences at any stage of the review were resolved by discussion. We also extracted data and assessed the quality of studies independently. We contacted investigators for additional information and performed quantitative analysis when appropriate data were available.

Main Results

Twenty two trials (16 on adults, eight in children) involving 4199 people (3716 adults and 483 children) were included. RESULTS OF STUDIES IN ADULTS 1. Antitussives Five trials compared antitussives with placebo. Codeine was no more effective than placebo in reducing cough symptoms. One study favoured dextromethorphan over placebo, whereas a second did not show an effect. Moguisteine was no more effective than placebo apart from a reduction of cough in a subgroup of participants with more severe night cough. 2. Expectorants Two trials compared guaifenesin with placebo. In the larger study, 75 per cent of participants taking guaifenesin stated that the medicine was helpful compared to 31 per cent in the control group (p less than 0.01). In the second study, both groups showed improvement with respect to cough frequency and severity, with no statistically significant differences between groups. 3. Mucolytics One trial compared a mucolytic with placebo. Active treatment reduced cough frequency and symptom scores on day four and eight. 4. Antihistamine-decongestant combinations Two studies compared antihistamine-decongestant combinations with placebo. Antihistamine-decongestant were significantly more effective than placebo (p less than 0.01). 5. Other drug combinations Three studies compared combinations of drugs other than antihistamine-decongestant with placebo. Two studies were effective in reducing cough symptoms, and one study showed relief at night but not during the day. 6. Antihistamines Three trials compared antihistamines with placebo. Antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms. RESULTS OF STUDIES IN CHILDREN 1. Antitussives Antitussives were no more effective than placebo (one study) 2. Expectorants No studies using expectorants met our inclusion criteria. 3. Mucolytics The results of one trial favoured active treatment over placebo from day four until day 10 (p < 0.01) 4. Antihistamine-decongestant combinations Two studies showed no difference between anthistamine-decongestant combinations and placebo. 5. Other drug combinations One trial tested two paediatric cough syrups. Compared to placebo, both preparations showed a 'satisfactory response' in 46 per cent and 56 per cent of children compared to 21 per cent of children in the placebo group. 6. Antihistamines In one trial that tested antihistamines active treatment was no more effective than placebo.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution due to differences in study designs, populations, interventions and outcomes between studies. The numbers of studies in each group were small, and studies often showed conflicting results. Effect sizes in many studies were unclear and it is questionable as to whether all of the positive results are clinically relevant.

### A clinical pilot study on the safety and efficacy of aerosol inhalation treatment of IFN-κ plus TFF2 in patients with moderate COVID-19 [^113BuUEa]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The outbreak of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) poses a great challenge to global public health. New and effective intervention strategies are urgently needed to combat the disease.

Methods

We conducted an open-label, non-randomized, clinical trial involving moderate COVID-19 patients according to study protocol. Patients were assigned in a 1:2 ratio to receive either aerosol inhalation treatment with IFN-κ and TFF2, every 48 h for three consecutive dosages, in addition to standard treatment (experimental group), or standard treatment alone (control group). The end point was the time to discharge from the hospital. This study is registered with chictr.org.cn, ChiCTR2000030262.

Findings

A total of thirty-three eligible COVID-19 patients were enrolled from February 1, 2020 to April 6, 2020, eleven were assigned to the IFN-κ plus TFF2 group, and twenty-two to the control group. Safety and efficacy were evaluated for both groups. No treatment-associated severe adverse effects (SAE) were observed in the group treated with aerosol inhalation of IFN-κ plus TFF2, and no significant differences in the safety evaluations were observed between experimental and control groups. CT imaging was performed in all patients with the median improvement time of 5. 0 days (IQR 3. 0–9. 0) in the experimental group versus 8. 5 days (IQR 3. 0–17. 0) in the control group (p < 0. 05). In addition, the experimental group had a significant shorten median time in cough relief (4. 5 days [IQR 2. 0–7. 0]) than the control group did (10. 0 days [IQR 6. 0–21. 0])(p < 0. 005), in viral RNA reversion of 6. 0 days (IQR 2. 0–13. 0) in the experimental group vs 9.5 days (IQR 3. 0–23. 0) in the control group (p < 0. 05), and in the median hospitalization stays of 12. 0 days (IQR 7.0–20.0) in the experimental group vs 15. 0 days (IQR 10.0–25.0) in the control group (p < 0. 001), respectively.

Interpretation

Aerosol inhalation of IFN-κ plus TFF2 is a safe treatment and is likely to significantly facilitate clinical improvement, including cough relief, CT imaging improvement, and viral RNA reversion, thereby achieves an early release from hospitalization. These data support to explore a scale-up trial with IFN-κ plus TFF2.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^113FjQVZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

How to approach a patient when considering pharmacologic treatments for COVID-19 — this section discusses how to approach a patient suspected to have COVID-19 and how to apply the IDSA COVID-19 treatment guidelines to specific clinical syndromes. The guideline notes that the certainty of supporting evidence is low to moderate for most recommendations and that the panel made conditional suggestions rather than strong recommendations for or against most of the agents. It further states that though substantial progress was made with COVID-19 therapies, there remain many unanswered questions in the management of COVID-19, and that despite limited evidence, to give actionable and timely guidance to frontline clinicians, it provides recommendations for use of combinations of agents, recommends some agents over others, or extrapolates to sub populations not evaluated in trials. Critical unanswered questions identified include which sub-populations or specific clinical types of patients benefit most from specific therapeutic agents, what the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 therapies are in populations immune from prior SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccination, what the efficacy and safety of treatments are in infections with specific SARS-CoV-2 variants and sub-variants, and how therapeutic agents perform when compared to each other to allow a tiered approach to treating patients with COVID-19.

### Efficacy and safety of GST-HG171 in adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 / 3 trial [^116DdLfx]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary efficacy endpoint was time to sustained recovery of clinical symptoms within 28 days after treatment. Key secondary efficacy endpoints included changes in viral load from baseline to day 4, time to sustained recovery of fever and respiratory symptoms (i.e. cough, congestion or runny nose, sore throat or dry throat, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing) within 28 days, and time to negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid within 28 days. Other secondary efficacy endpoints included time to sustained relief of clinical symptoms within 28 days, area under the viral load-time curve (AUC) within 14 days, clinical symptom score-time AUC within 14 days, percentage of COVID-19 progression (defined as progression to severe/critical COVID-19 or all-cause mortality) and sustained recovery of clinical symptoms by visits, and changes in the scores of COVID-19 symptoms and chest CT scan from baseline. Sustained recovery or relief of clinical symptoms was defined as the score of 0 or 1 for all COVID-19-related target symptoms for 2 consecutive days, with the event date defined as the first day of the 2 consecutive days. Safety endpoints included the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events, as well as any clinically significant abnormality of vital signs, physical examination, laboratory tests, and electrocardiograms during the study.

To streamline the PCR test sample collection during the initial 7 days of the study, ensuring better patient compliance, and also considering the observed peak effect of viral load reduction around day 4, as reported by Ensitrelvir treatment, we modified the sampling time points. In Protocol Version 1.3, sampling occurred at day 3, 4, 5, and 7, which was revised to day 4 and 7 in Protocol Version 1.4/1.5 during the first week of the study. Accordingly, the key secondary endpoint evaluating changes in viral load from baseline to day 5 in Protocol Version 1.3 was adjusted to day 4 in Protocol Version 1.4/1.5. Moreover, to better assess the effect on viral clearance, the time to negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid within 28 days was highlighted as an additional key secondary endpoint in Protocol Version 1.4/1.5.

We conducted this systemic review and meta-analysis in an attempt to evaluate the efficacy and safety of umifenovir in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and medRxiv database. We included both retrospective and prospective studies. The mean difference (MD) and risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were applied to assess the effectiveness of umifenovir for COVID-19. A total of 12 studies with 1052 patients were included in our final studies. Compared with control group, umifenovir was associated with higher negative rate of PCR on day 14 (RR:1.27; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.55). However, umifenovir is not related to nucleus acid negative conversion time (MD: 0.09; 95% CI: -1.48 to 1.65), negative rate on day 7 (RR:1.09; 95% CI: 0.91 to 1.31), incidence of composite endpoint (RR:1.20; 95% CI: 0.61 to 2.37), rate of fever alleviation on day 7 (RR:1.00; 95% CI: 0.91 to 1.10), rate of cough alleviation on day 7 (RR:1.00; 95% CI: 0.85 to 1.18), or hospital length of stay (MD: 1.34; 95% CI: -2.08 to 4.76). Additionally, umifenovir was safe in COVID-19 patients (RR for incidence of adverse events: 1.29; 95% CI: 0.57 to 2.92). The results of sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were similar to pooled results. There is no evidence to support the use of umifenovir for improving patient-important outcomes in patients with COVID-19.

### Over-the-counter (OTC) medications for acute cough in children and adults in ambulatory settings [^113Hr835]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common symptom. Non-prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are frequently recommended as a first-line treatment, but there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral OTC cough preparations for acute cough in children and adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2012 Issue 3 which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 1 2012), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2012), CINAHL (January 2010 to March 2012), LILACS (January 2010 to March 2012), Web of Science (January 2010 to March 2012) and the UK Department of Health National Research Register (March 2010).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral OTC cough preparations with placebo in children and adults suffering from acute cough in ambulatory settings. We considered all cough outcomes and secondary outcomes of interest were adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened potentially relevant citations, extracted data and assessed study quality. We performed quantitative analysis where appropriate.

Main Results

Twenty-six trials (18 in adults, eight in children) involving 4037 people (3421 adults and 616 children) were included. In the adult studies six trials compared antitussives with placebo and had variable results. Two trials compared the expectorant guaifenesin with placebo; one indicated significant benefit whereas the other did not. One trial found that a mucolytic reduced cough frequency and symptom scores. Two studies examined antihistamine-decongestant combinations and found conflicting results. Four studies compared other combinations of drugs with placebo and indicated some benefit in reducing cough symptoms. Three trials found antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms. In the children studies antitussives (two studies), antihistamines (two studies), antihistamine decongestants (two studies) and antitussive/bronchodilator combinations (one study) were no more effective than placebo. No studies using expectorants met our inclusion criteria. The results of one trial favoured active treatment with mucolytics over placebo. One trial tested two paediatric cough syrups and both preparations showed a 'satisfactory response' in 46% and 56% of children compared to 21% of children in the placebo group. A minority of studies reported adverse effects and described a low incidence of mainly minor side effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache and drowsiness.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution due to differences in study characteristics and quality. Studies often showed conflicting results with uncertainty regarding clinical relevance. Higher quality evidence is needed to determine the effectiveness of self care treatments for acute cough.

### Effects of guaifenesin, N-acetylcysteine, and ambroxol on MUC5AC and mucociliary transport in primary differentiated human tracheal-bronchial cells [^1116PDfj]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Mucus in the airways is required to trap pathogens and inhaled particles for clearance via the mucociliary escalator towards the pharynx, where it and its trapped particles are either swallowed or expectorated. Exposure to irritants and pathogens causes leucocyte activation and inflammatory mediator release, which increase mucus production and enhance clearance of the inciting stimuli. However, the balance between mucus production and clearance depends on optimal mucus quantities and hydration state, and periciliary fluid depth. Airway bacterial or viral infections, asthma or chronic bronchitis can cause excessive mucus production and secretion. Combined with possible rheological changes, altered ciliary beating or uncoupling from the ciliary movement due to changes in liquid layer depth, these conditions can cause defective mucociliary clearance and airway mucus accumulation. These factors lead, in turn, to coughing and subjective discomfort. In extreme cases, such as uncontrolled asthma, complete blockage of the airways with mucus can occur. There is, therefore, a need for improved therapeutic agents to improve mucociliary function under these pathophysiological conditions.

### Confronting COVID-19-associated cough and the post-COVID syndrome: role of viral neurotropism, neuroinflammation, and neuroimmune responses [^114QiqFY]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Cough is one of the most common presenting symptoms of COVID-19, along with fever and loss of taste and smell. Cough can persist for weeks or months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, often accompanied by chronic fatigue, cognitive impairment, dyspnoea, or pain-a collection of long-term effects referred to as the post-COVID syndrome or long COVID. We hypothesise that the pathways of neurotropism, neuroinflammation, and neuroimmunomodulation through the vagal sensory nerves, which are implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection, lead to a cough hypersensitivity state. The post-COVID syndrome might also result from neuroinflammatory events in the brain. We highlight gaps in understanding of the mechanisms of acute and chronic COVID-19-associated cough and post-COVID syndrome, consider potential ways to reduce the effect of COVID-19 by controlling cough, and suggest future directions for research and clinical practice. Although neuromodulators such as gabapentin or opioids might be considered for acute and chronic COVID-19 cough, we discuss the possible mechanisms of COVID-19-associated cough and the promise of new anti-inflammatories or neuromodulators that might successfully target both the cough of COVID-19 and the post-COVID syndrome.

### Patient-reported outcomes to assess the efficacy of extended-release guaifenesin for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infection symptoms [^115w8FQK]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

Based on the overall results from the pilot study, the most promising tools for discriminating symptomatic improvements between the active treatment and placebo were found to be symptom self-assessments by the patient, i.e. the DCPD and the SSSA with peak separation at Days 4 and 5. Additional post hoc analyses of the data indicated that the best way to discriminate between the active and placebo treatments is to use a composite sub-score of the questions in the DCPD; the 'SUM8', limited to the symptoms questions numbered 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, and 11, seemed best suited to capture the effects of the treatment.

Results from the validation study provided further evidence that SUM8 is likely to be a sensitive and precise measure for evaluating changes in URTI respiratory symptoms over time with an expectorant treatment, demonstrated by the reliability and validity estimates. The SUM8 scale demonstrated sensitivity to detect changes over time with patient ratings of efficacy. During interviews some minor inconsistencies in the interpretation of the terminology were found, therefore, future studies could provide patients with training and/or a glossary that further defines any potentially ambiguous terms.

It was determined that the SUM8 is a comprehensive symptom measure that evaluates aspects of phlegm experience, with six items dedicated to this concept. As ER guaifenesin is an expectorant that improves the rheology and clearance of respiratory tract mucus, this comprehensive measure of phlegm may be optimal for precisely evaluating treatment effects.

Results suggest that from the patient's perspective, a clinically meaningful change in the SUM8 might be approximately 4.58 points. This score represents an intra-individual Minimally Important Difference (MID). A limitation of this analysis was that, due to the population being studied and the natural disease progression of URTIs, study design, and available measures, it was not possible to adequately evaluate test–retest reliability estimates.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and guaifenesin (Obredon) [^111oHFNA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.3 Monitoring, Maintenance, and Discontinuation of Therapy

Prescribe OBREDON for the shortest duration that is consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24–72 hours of initiating therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Reevaluate patients with unresponsive cough in 5 days or sooner for possible underlying pathology, such as foreign body or lower respiratory tract disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. If a patient requires a refill, reevaluate the cause of the cough and assess the need for continued treatment with OBREDON, the relative incidence of adverse reactions, and the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Do not abruptly discontinue OBREDON in a physically-dependent patient [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]. When a patient who has been taking OBREDON regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with OBREDON, taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both.

Purpose Of Review

COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 6.6 million deaths globally. Tremendous efforts have been committed for the development of new and repurposed drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. Although different international and national guidelines share consensus in the management of COVID-19 disease with different levels of severity, new challenges have emerged, steering the need for ongoing research in advancing the clinical management of COVID-19.

Recent Findings

This review focuses on recent data from randomized trials and postmarketing real-world evidence for the treatment of mild to moderate disease in the outpatient setting and patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with varying level of severity. Relevant data for treatment of the latest omicron sub-variants in people who received vaccination are presented. Challenges in special populations, including immunocompromised hosts, patients with renal failure and pregnant women, are also discussed.

Summary

Treatment of COVID-19 should be personalized according to host characteristics, degree of severity and available treatment options.

### The effect of early treatment with ivermectin on viral load, symptoms and humoral response in patients with non-severe COVID-19: a pilot, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial [^113wTLdS]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Ivermectin inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro at concentrations not readily achievable with currently approved doses. There is limited evidence to support its clinical use in COVID-19 patients. We conducted a Pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a single dose of ivermectin reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 when administered early after disease onset.

Methods

Consecutive patients with non-severe COVID-19 and no risk factors for complicated disease attending the emergency room of the Clínica Universidad de Navarra between July 31, 2020 and September 11, 2020 were enrolled. All enrollments occurred within 72 h of onset of fever or cough. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive ivermectin, 400 mcg/kg, single dose (n = 12) or placebo (n = 12). The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA by PCR from nasopharyngeal swab at day 7 post-treatment. The primary outcome was supported by determination of the viral load and infectivity of each sample. The differences between ivermectin and placebo were calculated using Fisher's exact test and presented as a relative risk ratio. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04390022.

Findings

All patients recruited completed the trial (median age, 26 [IQR 19–36 in the ivermectin and 21–44 in the controls] years; 12 [50%] women; 100% had symptoms at recruitment, 70% reported headache, 62% reported fever, 50% reported general malaise and 25% reported cough). At day 7, there was no difference in the proportion of PCR positive patients (RR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.77–1.09, p = 1.0). The ivermectin group had non-statistically significant lower viral loads at day 4 (p = 0.24 for gene E; p = 0.18 for gene N) and day 7 (p = 0.16 for gene E; p = 0.18 for gene N) post treatment as well as lower IgG titers at day 21 post treatment (p = 0.24). Patients in the ivermectin group recovered earlier from hyposmia/anosmia (76 vs 158 patient-days; p < 0.001).

Interpretation

Among patients with non-severe COVID-19 and no risk factors for severe disease receiving a single 400 mcg/kg dose of ivermectin within 72 h of fever or cough onset there was no difference in the proportion of PCR positives. There was however a marked reduction of self-reported anosmia/hyposmia, a reduction of cough and a tendency to lower viral loads and lower IgG titers which warrants assessment in larger trials.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and guaifenesin (Obredon) [^112JDaRv]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Administer OBREDON by the oral route only

Always use an accurate milliliter measuring device when administering OBREDON to ensure that the dose is measured and administered accurately. A household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring device and could lead to overdosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. For prescriptions where a measuring device is not provided, a pharmacist can provide an appropriate measuring device and can provide instructions for measuring the correct dose. Do not overfill. Rinse the measuring device with water after each use.

Advise patients not to increase the dose or dosing frequency of OBREDON because serious adverse events such as respiratory depression may occur with overdosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Overdosage (10)]. The dosage of OBREDON should not be increased if cough fails to respond; an unresponsive cough should be reevaluated for possible underlying pathology [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

2.2 Recommended Dosage

Adults and adolescents 18 years of age and older: 10 mL every 4 to 6 hours, not to exceed 6 doses (60 mL) in 24 hours.

### COVID-19 diagnosis and management: a comprehensive review [^115TGeLu]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, a novel coronavirus from the same family as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, has spread worldwide leading the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), presents flu-like symptoms which can become serious in high-risk individuals. Here, we provide an overview of the known clinical features and treatment options for COVID-19. We carried out a systematic literature search using the main online databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, UpToDate, Embase and Web of Science) with the following keywords: 'COVID-19', '2019-nCoV', 'coronavirus' and 'SARS-CoV-2'. We included publications from 1 January 2019 to 3 April 2020 which focused on clinical features and treatments. We found that infection is transmitted from human to human and through contact with contaminated environmental surfaces. Hand hygiene is fundamental to prevent contamination. Wearing personal protective equipment is recommended in specific environments. The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, fatigue, slight dyspnoea, sore throat, headache, conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal issues. Real-time PCR is used as a diagnostic tool using nasal swab, tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage samples. Computed tomography findings are important for both diagnosis and follow-up. To date, there is no evidence of any effective treatment for COVID-19. The main therapies being used to treat the disease are antiviral drugs, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and respiratory therapy. In conclusion, although many therapies have been proposed, quarantine is the only intervention that appears to be effective in decreasing the contagion rate. Specifically designed randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the most appropriate evidence-based treatment modality.

### Vilobelimab (Gohibic) [^111TAG5L]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus. You can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus.

COVID-19 illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, serious illness can happen and may cause some of your other medical conditions to become worse. People of all ages with severe, long-lasting (chronic) medical conditions like heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, for example, seem to be at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19.

What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

The symptoms of COVID-19 may include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which can appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. Serious illness, including breathing problems, can occur and may cause your other medical conditions to become worse.

What is GOHIBIC?

GOHIBIC is an investigational medicine used for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults when initiated within 48 hours of receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). GOHIBIC is investigational because it is still being studied. GOHIBIC is not FDA-approved to treat COVID-19.

### Effect of a single 1200 Mg dose of mucinex® on mucociliary and cough clearance during an acute respiratory tract infection [^112DMuh9]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Observational studies suggest that orally administered guaifenesin (GGE) may thin lower respiratory tract secretions but none have examined its effects on mucociliary and cough clearance (MCC/CC) during a respiratory tract infection (RTI). The current study was a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in non-smoking adults who suffered from an acute upper RTI.

Methods

We assessed the effects of a single dose of Mucinex(®) 1200 mg (2 × 600 mg extended release tablets) (ER GGE) on 1) MCC/CC by assessing the rate of removal from the lung of inhaled radioactive tracer particles (Tc99m-sulfur colloid), 2) sputum dynamic rheology by stress/strain creep transformation over the linear part of the curve, 3) sessile drop interfacial tension by the deNouy ring technique, and 4) subjective symptom measures. MCC was measured during the morning (period 1) and compared to that in the afternoon 4 h later (period 2) immediately following either drug (n = 19) or placebo (n = 19). For both period 1 and 2 subjects performed 60 voluntary coughs from 60 to 90 min after inhalation of radio-labeled aerosol for a measure of CC. Sputum properties were measured from subjects who expectorated sputum during the cough period post treatment (n = 8–12 for each cohort).

Results

We found no effect of ER GGE on MCC or CC compared to placebo. MCC through 60 min for period 1 vs. 2 = 8.3 vs. 11.8% (placebo) and = 9.7 vs. 11.1% (drug) (NS) and CC for period 1 vs. 2 was 9.9 vs. 9.1% (placebo) and 10.8 vs. 5.6% (drug) (NS). There was no significant difference in sputum biophysical properties after administration of drug or placebo.

Conclusions

There was no significant effect of a single dose of ER GGE on MCC/CC or on sputum biophysical properties compared to placebo in this population of adult patients with an acute RTI. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01114581.

### Treatment of COVID-19 patients with a SARS-CoV-2-specific siRNA-peptide dendrimer formulation [^112fmbXq]. Allergy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) infection frequently causes severe and prolonged disease but only few specific treatments are available. We aimed to investigate safety and efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2-specific siRNA-peptide dendrimer formulation MIR 19® (siR-7-EM/KK-46) targeting a conserved sequence in known SARS-CoV-2 variants for treatment of COVID-19.

Methods

We conducted an open-label, randomized, controlled multicenter phase II trial (NCT05184127) evaluating safety and efficacy of inhaled siR-7-EM/KK-46 (3.7 mg and 11.1 mg/day: low and high dose, respectively) in comparison with standard etiotropic drug treatment (control group) in patients hospitalized with moderate COVID-19 (N = 52 for each group). The primary endpoint was the time to clinical improvement according to predefined criteria within 14days of randomization.

Results

Patients from the low-dose group achieved the primary endpoint defined by simultaneous achievement of relief of fever, normalization of respiratory rate, reduction of coughing, and oxygen saturation of > 95% for 48h significantly earlier (median 6days; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5–7, HR 1.75, p = .0005) than patients from the control group (8days; 95% CI: 7–10). No significant clinical efficacy was observed for the high-dose group. Adverse events were reported in 26 (50.00%), 25 (48.08%), and 28 (53.85%) patients from the low-, high-dose and control group, respectively. None of them were associated with siR-7-EM/KK-46.

Conclusions

siR-7-EM/KK-46, a SARS-CoV-2-specific siRNA-peptide dendrimer formulation is safe, well tolerated and significantly reduces time to clinical improvement in patients hospitalized with moderate COVID-19 compared to standard therapy in a randomized controlled trial.

### Efficacy of inhaled ciclesonide for outpatient treatment of adolescents and adults with symptomatic COVID-19: a randomized clinical trial [^112JE8pp]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Systemic corticosteroids are commonly used in treating severe COVID-19. However, the role of inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate disease is less clear.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of the inhaled steroid ciclesonide in reducing the time to alleviation of all COVID-19-related symptoms among nonhospitalized participants with symptomatic COVID-19 infection.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted at 10 centers throughout the US and assessed the safety and efficacy of a ciclesonide metered-dose inhaler (MDI) for treating nonhospitalized participants with symptomatic COVID-19 infection who were screened from June 11, 2020, to November 3, 2020.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to receive ciclesonide MDI, 160 μg per actuation, for a total of 2 actuations twice a day (total daily dose, 640 μg) or placebo for 30 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was time to alleviation of all COVID-19-related symptoms (cough, dyspnea, chills, feeling feverish, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and new loss of taste or smell) by day 30. Secondary end points included subsequent emergency department visits or hospital admissions for reasons attributable to COVID-19.

Results

A total of 413 participants were screened and 400 (96.9%) were enrolled and randomized (197 [49.3%] in the ciclesonide arm and 203 [50.7%] in the placebo arm; mean [SD] age, 43.3 [16.9] years; 221 [55.3%] female; 2 [0.5%] Asian, 47 [11.8%] Black or African American, 3 [0.8%] Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 345 [86.3%] White, and 1 multiracial individuals [0.3%]; 172 Hispanic or Latino individuals [43.0%]). The median time to alleviation of all COVID-19-related symptoms was 19.0 days (95% CI, 14.0–21.0) in the ciclesonide arm and 19.0 days (95% CI, 16.0–23.0) in the placebo arm. There was no difference in resolution of all symptoms by day 30 (odds ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.84–1.97). Participants who were treated with ciclesonide had fewer subsequent emergency department visits or hospital admissions for reasons related to COVID-19 (odds ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.04–0.85). No participants died during the study.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this randomized clinical trial demonstrated that ciclesonide did not achieve the primary efficacy end point of reduced time to alleviation of all COVID-19-related symptoms.

### Effects of ivermectin in patients with COVID-19: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial [^116ZHdJS]. Clinical Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Given the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is a global urgency to discover an effective treatment for patients withthis disease. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the widely used antiparasitic drug ivermectin on outcomes in patients with COVID-19.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial, patients with COVID-19 admitted to 2 referral tertiary hospitals in Mazandaran, Iran, were randomly divided into 2 groups: intervention and control. In addition to standard treatment for COVID-19, the intervention group received a single weight-based dose (0.2 mg/kg) of ivermectin; the control group received the standard of care. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging data from participants were recorded at baseline. Patients were assessed daily for symptoms and disease progression. The primary clinical outcome measures were the durations of hospital stay, fever, dyspnea, and cough; and overall clinical improvement.

Findings

Sixty-nine patients were enrolled (mean [SD] ages: ivermectin, 47.63 [22.20] years; control, 45.18 [23.11] years; P = 0.65). Eighteen patients (51.4%) in the ivermectin group and 18 (52.9%) in control group were male (P = 0.90). The mean durations of dyspnea were 2.6 (0.4) days in the ivermectin group and 3.8 (0.4) days in the control group (P = 0.048). Also, persistent cough lasted for 3.1 (0.4) days in the ivermectin group compared to 4.8 (0.4) days in control group (PP = 0.019). The mean durations of hospital stay were 7.1 (0.5) days versus 8.4 (0.6) days in the ivermectin and control groups, respectively (P = 0.016). Also, the frequency of lymphopenia decreased to 14.3% in the ivermectin group and did not change in the control group (P = 0.007).

Implications

A single dose of ivermectin was well-tolerated in symptomatic patients with COVID-19, and important clinical features of COVID-19 were improved with ivermectin use, including dyspnea, cough, and lymphopenia. Further studies with larger sample sizes, different drug dosages, dosing intervals and durations, especially in different stages of the disease, may be useful in understanding the potential clinical benefits ivermectin.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^116nECM8]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnosis, guidelines agreed that acute pediatric cough (which is most commonly URTI-based) can usually be diagnosed by patient history and examination, whereas chronic pediatric cough requires systematic evaluation to identify the underlying disease. Most experts agreed that chronic pediatric cough requires further diagnostic investigations, and each expert listed a variety of investigations they had used in the past 6 months (most commonly spirometry, chest X-ray, and allergy testing), presumably representative of the patients that had presented at their respective clinics, and the testing that was possible during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Considering the treatment of acute cough symptoms, guidelines highlighted the lack of evidence for OTC and prescription cough medicines. This was mirrored in the expert survey, where participants had differing opinions on which medicines were most suitable for different symptoms. Experts considered honey to be one of the most effective and well tolerated acute cough treatments, with some support from clinical studies. Most experts had recommended phytomedicines for the treatment of acute pediatric cough. Cough-related pain and sleep disruption were highlighted as symptoms for which current therapies are lacking. The majority of children with cough (and their parents) suffer from disturbed sleep, and there is a need for additional treatment options in this area. Experts judged that systemic steroids and immunostimulants are generally not efficacious, and are among the least well tolerated options in children, indicating a need for alternative rapid-acting treatment options. Considering chronic cough, there is greater consensus on its treatment, which involves addressing the underlying cough-causing disease.

### Cough and sputum in long COVID are associated with severe acute COVID-19: a Japanese cohort study [^1158xo2S]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has spread worldwide since its outbreak in China in December 2019. A large number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 have been reported, and the pandemic is ongoing, although vaccines are widely available. Most patients who have recovered from acute COVID-19 experience long-term effects on multiple organs and systems. In most cases, persistent symptoms resolve over several months. However, some patients experience systemic symptoms that persist for more than 3–24 months. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed a consensus definition of the post-COVID-19 condition in 2021. To date, these sequelae have been called post-acute COVID-19, long-haul COVID, post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), or post-acute syndrome of COVID-19. These systemic symptoms, including coughing and sputum, deteriorate the quality of life of patients and cause health and social burdens.

Cough is a protective response against the elimination of inhaled foreign substances and airway secretions. Patients with acute or chronic respiratory diseases often present with cough. Persistent cough for > 8 weeks is defined as chronic cough accompanied by chronic respiratory diseases, including asthma, COPD, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and otorhinolaryngological disorders with posterior nasal leakage. Cough is classified as dry or productive, based on the presence or absence of sputum. Productive cough is primarily associated with pneumonia and/or bronchitis caused by infectious diseases. Sputum is occasionally the main symptom without cough, especially in chronic respiratory diseases such as bronchiectasis. Therapeutic strategies for cough and sputum are planned to treat underlying diseases using antitussive agents and expectorants. Cough during acute COVID-19 infection (acute COVID-19-associated cough) occurs in 40.5–72.5% of the patients. This symptom generally improves, and its incidence rate decreases to 18% at the 3-month follow-up. Conversely, 10% of post-infected patients still have a prolonged cough 2 years after acute infection (post COVID-19 cough), while only 4% of COVID-19 uninfected patients exhibit cough.

What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus. This type of coronavirus has not been seen before. This new coronavirus was first found in people in December 2019. You can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus.

COVID-19 illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, serious illness can happen and may cause some of your other medical conditions to become worse. Older people and people of all ages with severe, long lasting (chronic) medical conditions like heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, for example, seem to be at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19.

The symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough and shortness of breath, which may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. Serious illness including breathing problems can occur and may cause your other medical conditions to become worse.

What is PROPOFOL-LIPURO 1% INJECTABLE EMULSION FOR INFUSION?

Propofol-Lipuro 1% injectable emulsion for infusion belongs to a group of medicines called sedatives/hypnotics. It will be used to help calm (sedate) you if you need a tube inserted (intubation) and a machine to help you breathe (ventilator) while in an ICU.

### Pemivibart (Pemgarda) [^114XJajy]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.4 Risk for COVID-19 Due to SARS-CoV-2 Viral Variants with Substantially Reduced Susceptibility to PEMGARDA

Certain SARS-CoV-2 viral variants may emerge that have substantially reduced susceptibility to PEMGARDA. PEMGARDA may not be effective at preventing COVID-19 caused by these SARS‑CoV-2 viral variants. The cell culture neutralization activity of PEMGARDA against SARS-CoV-2 viral variants is described in Microbiology (12.4).

Inform individuals of the increased risk, compared to other variants, for COVID-19 due to emergent SARS-CoV-2 viral variants that exhibit substantially reduced susceptibility to PEMGARDA. If signs or symptoms of COVID-19 occur, advise individuals to test for COVID-19 and seek medical attention, including starting treatment for COVID-19 as appropriate. Symptoms of COVID-19 may include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, or diarrhea.

### Cough suppressant and pharmacologic protussive therapy: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116wjzSs]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Cough-suppressant therapy, previously termed nonspecific antitussive therapy, incorporates the use of pharmacologic agents with mucolytic effects and/or inhibitory effects on the cough reflex itself. The intent of this type of therapy is to reduce the frequency and/or intensity of coughing on a short-term basis.

Methods

Data for this review were obtained from several National Library of Medicine (PubMed) searches (from 1960 to 2004), which were performed between May and September 2004, of the literature published in the English language, limited to human studies, using combinations of the search terms "cough", "double-blind placebo-controlled", "antitussive", "mucolytic", "cough clearance", "common cold", "protussive", "guaifenesin", "glycerol", and "zinc".

Results

Mucolytic agents are not consistently effective in ameliorating cough in patients with bronchitis, although they may be of benefit to this population in other ways. Peripheral and central antitussive agents can be useful in patients with chronic bronchitis, but can have little efficacy in patients with cough due to upper respiratory infection. Some protussive agents are effective in increasing cough clearance, but their long-term effectiveness has not been established. DNase is not effective as a protussive agent in patients with cystic fibrosis. Inhaled mannitol is acutely effective in this patient population, but its therapeutic potential must be investigated further.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that suppressant therapy is most effective when used for the short-term reduction of coughing. Relatively few drugs are effective as cough suppressants.

### Global physiology and pathophysiology of cough: part 1: cough phenomenology-CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116NB1j2]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Secretion properties and cough clearance — mechanisms and pharmacologic modifiers — are described across cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, and bronchorrhea. Cough transportability decreases during inflammation due to polymeric DNA and F-actin increasing adhesion, and the resulting tenacity is one of the most important mechanisms reducing the effectiveness of cough in patients with CF or COPD. Diverse medications have been developed to modify secretions so they can be more easily cleared by cough, but the archetype classic mucolytic N-acetyl L-cysteine has no clinical evidence of effectiveness in promoting cough clearance. Peptide mucolytics such as dornase alfa are designed to degrade DNA and F-actin; in non-CF bronchiectasis and COPD there is no evidence that dornase alfa is effective and it is reported to increase mortality when used in diseases other than CF. Expectorants such as guaifenesin and hyperosmolar solutions are intended to increase surface liquid hydration to aid cough detachment, yet guaifenesin or glycerol guaiacolate is ineffective as an expectorant and of no benefit in sputum retention, whereas hypertonic saline and inhaled dry powder mannitol may improve pulmonary function and/or quality of life in CF and non-CF bronchiectasis; these agents are sometimes referred to as hydrators. In patients with exceptionally thin, watery secretions (bronchorrhea), mucus-thickening drugs have been proposed, but tetracycline and airway acidification have not been shown to be effective in treating bronchorrhea. Because impaired sputum and mucus clearance can cause significant morbidity across CF, COPD, severe asthma, bronchiectasis, and diffuse panbronchiolitis, there is renewed interest in therapies to increase airflow, decrease tenacity, or optimize viscoelasticity; although some medications such as beta agonists can increase ciliary beat frequency, this seems to have only a negligible effect on mucus clearance, and decreasing mucus adherence to the epithelial surface would likely improve both ciliary and cough clearance.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and guaifenesin (Obredon) [^115VM4E1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse

OBREDON contains hydrocodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, OBREDON exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)], which can lead to overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Reserve OBREDON for use in adult patients for whom the benefits of cough suppression are expected to outweigh the risks, and in whom an adequate assessment of the etiology of the cough has been made. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing OBREDON, prescribe OBREDON for the shortest duration that is consistent with individual patient treatment goals, monitor all patients regularly for the development of addiction or abuse, and refill only after reevaluation of the need for continued treatment.

Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed OBREDON. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression).

Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing OBREDON. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and guaifenesin (Obredon) [^111uhpWa]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

OBREDON is not indicated for use in patients younger than 18 years of age because the benefits of symptomatic treatment of cough associated with allergies or the common cold do not outweigh the risks for use of hydrocodone in these patients [see Indications (1), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received hydrocodone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death, OBREDON is contraindicated in children less than 6 years of age [see Contraindications (4)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies have not been conducted with OBREDON in geriatric populations.

Use caution when considering the use of OBREDON in patients 65 years of age or older. Elderly patients may have increased sensitivity to hydrocodone; greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function; or concomitant disease or other drug therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, including OBREDON. Respiratory depression has occurred after large initial doses of opioids were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.8)].

Hydrocodone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, monitor these patients closely for respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension.

8.6 Renal Impairment

The pharmacokinetics of OBREDON has not been characterized in patients with renal impairment. Patients with renal impairment may have higher plasma concentrations than those with normal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. OBREDON should be used with caution in patients with severe impairment of renal function, and patients should be monitored closely for respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

The pharmacokinetics of OBREDON has not been characterized in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic impairment may have higher plasma concentrations than those with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, OBREDON should be used with caution in patients with severe impairment of hepatic function, and patients should be monitored closely for respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and guaifenesin (Obredon) [^114rbDNR]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.4 Risks with Use in Other At-Risk Populations

Unresponsive Cough The dosage of OBREDON should not be increased if cough fails to respond; an unresponsive cough should be reevaluated in 5 days or sooner for possible underlying pathology, such as foreign body or lower respiratory tract disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Asthma and Other Pulmonary Disease

The use of OBREDON in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].

Opioid analgesics and antitussives, including hydrocodone, one of the active ingredients in OBREDON, should not be used in patients with acute febrile illness associated with productive cough or in patients with chronic respiratory disease where interference with ability to clear the tracheobronchial tree of secretions would have a deleterious effect on the patient's respiratory function.

OBREDON-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of OBREDON [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Because of the risk of respiratory depression, avoid the use of opioid antitussives, including OBREDON in patients with compromised respiratory function, patients at risk of respiratory failure, and in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients. If OBREDON is prescribed, monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating OBREDON and when OBREDON is given concomitantlywith other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

### Symptom management in people dying with COVID-19: multinational observational study [^116jaXdz]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Specialist palliative care services have been critical in managing people dying with COVID-19 and ensuring symptom control towards the end of life. Frequent symptoms in severe COVID-19 include breathlessness and agitation. Cough, fever, fatigue, pain and respiratory secretions are also common.

A recent rapid review on the pharmacological strategies used for symptom management in patients dying of COVID-19 found seven studies (n = 493 patients), and concluded that modest doses of morphine and midazolam are required for symptom control. There is very limited evidence on international practice and service-level perspectives regarding pharmacological management of symptoms and the perceived effectiveness of medicines in patients dying with COVID-19.

Opioids and benzodiazepines are recommended in guidelines for breathlessness in severe COVID-19. Opioids are generally used in palliative care and are the first line treatment for refractory breathlessness. Benzodiazepines have been recommended in patients dying from severe COVID-19, but there is mixed evidence in other advanced illnesses on benefits and harms, and no evidence in COVID-19.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, benzodiazepine prescribing had been reported to differ between the UK and European countries. Huerta et al reported higher benzodiazepine prescribing in UK and Spanish electronic healthcare databases, but lower prescribing in Dutch, German and Danish databases. Possible reasons for differences included variation in help-seeking habits of patients and the diseases for which benzodiazepines are indicated by country as well as prescribing habits. Despite the adverse effects associated with benzodiazepines, the majority of hospice clinicians view them as beneficial treatments for breathlessness and agitation.

While pain, agitation, fever and cough are severe symptoms in COVID-19, there have been limited information about their clinical management. Given the lack of clarity on benzodiazepine benefit for breathlessness, concerns around safety and variation in its prescribing by country, and the dearth of information around prescribing for pain, agitation, fever and cough in COVID-19, it is important to understand what is being prescribed for symptom control in patients dying with COVID-19 and whether prescribed medicines are considered to be effective by specialist palliative care services. We therefore aimed to describe multinational prescribing practices of specialist palliative care services for symptom management in patients dying with COVID-19 and the perceived effectiveness of medicines.

### Effectiveness of guaifenesin in the treatment of cough… [^115iV1df]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Guaifenesin is the only expectorant that has been considered effective by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. Despite its broad use in the treatment of cough, multiple studies have found inconsistent results supporting the effectiveness of guaifenesin as an expectorant or cough suppressant. Little information is available concerning the impact of guaifenesin on the sensitivity of the cough reflex. Dicpinigaitis and Gayle conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to assess the efficacy of a single dose of guaifenesin on cough reflex sensitivity. The trial involved a group of persons with acute viral upper respiratory tract infection and a group of healthy persons. The participants were nonsmokers, did not have a history of pulmonary disorders, and had no symptoms suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Within the previous four weeks, the healthy participants had no URI symptoms, seasonal allergies, or postnasal drip.

Participants with URI took no medications to control symptoms within at least 24 hours of the study. The URI and healthy groups each contained 14 persons. All participants were induced to cough during the capsaicin challenge test. The spirometry results did not differ between persons who received guaifenesin and persons who received placebo. Among patients with URI, those who received guaifenesin required significantly higher concentrations of capsaicin to induce cough compared with the placebo group. In seven of the 14 participants who received guaifenesin, the concentration needed to induce cough was double that of the placebo group. Among the healthy persons, no differences occurred between the placebo and guaifenesin groups with regard to the concentration of capsaicin that induced five or more coughs. The authors conclude that guaifenesin inhibits the cough reflex in patients with URI.

This action occurs because the cough receptors are transiently hypersensitive secondary to the URI. They add that this effect was not present in healthy persons. Studies have shown that this medication is an effective expectorant. The study by Dicpinigaitis and Gayle adds to this body of literature by demonstrating that guaifenesin also suppresses cough in patients with URI symptoms. This study provides physicians with a proven medication that can control the symptoms of URIs and provide supportive care for patients with URIs. — k. e. m.
