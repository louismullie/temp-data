## Question

A 52-year-old woman with a 2-year history of primary Sjögren's disease presents to your clinic complaining of persistent joint and muscle pain over the past several months. She describes the pain as aching and diffuse, affecting her hands, wrists, and shoulders, and says it interferes with her daily activities. She denies any significant joint swelling or redness. On examination, there is no evidence of synovitis or joint deformity. She has tried non-pharmacological measures such as heat packs and gentle exercise, with only minimal relief. She is concerned about taking new medications due to a history of mild gastritis.

According to current guidelines, what is the recommended first-line approach to managing this patient's musculoskeletal pain related to Sjögren's disease?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended first-line approach to managing musculoskeletal pain in primary Sjögren's disease for a 52-year-old woman with diffuse arthralgia/myalgia, no synovitis, and a history of mild gastritis, and to reconcile any conflicting guidance from major guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the pain phenotype is inflammatory versus non-inflammatory. Then, I should verify what EULAR 2020 and the Sjögren's Syndrome Foundation (SSF) 2017 guidelines actually recommend as first-line therapy. Next, I will examine the evidence base for hydroxychloroquine, including the JOQUER trial and subsequent analyses. After that, I need to consider the patient's gastritis and how that influences analgesic choices. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise plan with monitoring and escalation triggers, and I will double-check for any nuances or exceptions I might be missing.

> Let me first confirm the clinical phenotype. The absence of synovitis or deformity and the diffuse, aching quality of pain make this more consistent with non-inflammatory arthralgia/myalgia rather than inflammatory arthritis, which would typically show joint swelling, warmth, or morning stiffness lasting beyond 30 minutes. I should confirm that guidelines distinguish management by inflammatory status, because that will shape first-line choices [^317abd5f] [^173e3a35].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance. EULAR 2020 recommends considering analgesics or other pain-modifying agents for musculoskeletal pain, balancing benefits and harms, which supports a symptom-targeted approach in non-inflammatory presentations. In contrast, SSF 2017 recommends hydroxychloroquine monotherapy for inflammatory musculoskeletal pain, reflecting a disease-modifying intent in that phenotype. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — these are not contradictory; they address different pain mechanisms and thus different first-line strategies [^317abd5f] [^173e3a35].

> I will now examine the evidence for hydroxychloroquine. The JOQUER randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 120 patients with primary Sjögren's found no significant benefit of hydroxychloroquine over placebo for a composite of dryness, fatigue, and pain at 24 weeks, although there was a non-significant trend toward pain improvement. Wait, let me verify the subgroup signal: exploratory analyses suggested potential benefit in patients with higher interferon signatures, but this was hypothesis-generating rather than definitive, so routine use for diffuse musculoskeletal pain without inflammatory features is not supported by high-quality evidence [^b704b27d].

> Given the non-inflammatory phenotype and the patient's gastritis, I need to ensure analgesic choices are gastritis-friendly. Acetaminophen is a reasonable first-line analgesic given its favorable GI profile compared with NSAIDs; topical NSAIDs can be considered for focal joint pain if needed, and if systemic NSAIDs are unavoidable, gastroprotection should be used. I should confirm that guidelines endorse tailoring analgesia to comorbidities and patient preference, which they do [^317abd5f].

> But wait, what if the pain is actually fibromyalgia-like or multifactorial in Sjögren's, which is common? Non-pharmacologic strategies remain foundational: graded aerobic exercise, sleep hygiene, stress reduction, and cognitive-behavioral approaches have supportive evidence for chronic musculoskeletal pain and fatigue in inflammatory rheumatic diseases, even if Sjögren's-specific data are limited. I should emphasize these as co-therapy rather than replacements, and set expectations for gradual benefit over 6–12 weeks [^c1e4196e] [^dcaa6408].

> Next, I should review escalation triggers. If the patient develops objective synovitis, elevated inflammatory markers, or persistent, disabling pain despite optimized analgesia and non-pharmacologic care, then I should reconsider the diagnosis of inflammatory musculoskeletal involvement and consider hydroxychloroquine as a 6–12 month trial, acknowledging the modest and inconsistent evidence base. If there is no response, methotrexate is the next conventional agent in guidelines for inflammatory arthritis in Sjögren's, though evidence quality is limited and decisions should be individualized [^173e3a35] [^c1347617] [^f45ffbfa].

> I should double-check safety and monitoring. For hydroxychloroquine, baseline and annual retinal screening is recommended, with earlier checks if risk factors are present. For acetaminophen, staying within 3,000 mg/day and avoiding hepatic enzyme inducers or alcohol excess is prudent. If NSAIDs are ever used, assess GI risk and add PPI or H2RA as indicated, especially with a history of gastritis [^notfound].

> Putting this together, my first-line plan is: continue and optimize non-pharmacologic measures; initiate acetaminophen up to 3,000 mg/day in divided doses, reassessing efficacy and tolerability over 2–4 weeks; consider topical NSAIDs for focal joint pain if needed; and reserve hydroxychloroquine for evidence of inflammatory musculoskeletal disease or if pain remains refractory after a structured analgesic and non-pharmacologic trial. I will monitor for response, adverse effects, and any evolution toward inflammatory features that would prompt escalation per guidelines [^317abd5f] [^173e3a35] [^f45ffbfa].

---

The recommended first-line approach for musculoskeletal pain in primary Sjögren's disease is **acetaminophen or NSAIDs** for analgesia, with **hydroxychloroquine** considered if pain is inflammatory or refractory [^317abd5f] [^173e3a35]. Given the patient's gastritis, **acetaminophen is preferred**; if NSAIDs are needed, use the lowest effective dose with gastroprotection. Hydroxychloroquine may be added for persistent inflammatory pain, with a 6–12 month trial and baseline/annual retinal screening [^53a47173] [^6556230b]. Non-pharmacologic measures (exercise, physical therapy, CBT) should continue, and escalate to methotrexate or leflunomide if pain remains uncontrolled [^c1347617] [^cb0c9b07].

---

## Pharmacological management

### Analgesics

- **Acetaminophen**: Preferred first-line for mild pain; minimal GI risk.
- **NSAIDs**: Use cautiously due to gastritis; if needed, use lowest effective dose with gastroprotection (PPI or H2RA) [^notfound].
- **Topical NSAIDs**: Consider for localized joint pain to minimize systemic GI effects.

---

### Hydroxychloroquine

- **Indication**: Consider for inflammatory musculoskeletal pain or refractory symptoms [^173e3a35].
- **Evidence**: Modest benefit in pain/fatigue; JOQUER RCT showed no significant improvement in composite dryness/fatigue/pain vs placebo, but trends for pain improvement in some subgroups [^b704b27d] [^ee475073].
- **Monitoring**: Baseline and annual retinal exams; monitor for retinopathy [^6556230b].

---

### Glucocorticoids

Reserve for **short-term use** in severe inflammatory flares; avoid routine use due to adverse effects [^69258710] [^f45ffbfa].

---

## Non-pharmacological management

Non-pharmacologic care remains foundational: **exercise and physical therapy** improve pain, function, and quality of life; **cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)** helps manage chronic pain and coping; and patient education on pacing, joint protection, and stress management supports self-management [^c1e4196e] [^dcaa6408].

---

## Escalation strategies

If pain remains uncontrolled after 3–6 months of optimized first-line therapy, consider **methotrexate** as the next DMARD for inflammatory arthritis in Sjögren's [^c1347617] [^8a187b1b]. Leflunomide is an alternative when methotrexate is contraindicated or not tolerated [^cb0c9b07].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Acetaminophen | First-line analgesic | Preferred due to low GI risk |
| NSAIDs | Short-term use | Use with gastroprotection |
| Hydroxychloroquine | Inflammatory or refractory pain | 6–12 month trial; retinal monitoring |
| Methotrexate | Escalation if refractory | For inflammatory arthritis |
| Non-pharmacological | Adjunctive | Exercise, CBT, education |

---

The first-line approach is **acetaminophen or NSAIDs with gastroprotection**, adding hydroxychloroquine for inflammatory or refractory pain, while continuing non-pharmacologic measures and escalating to methotrexate or leflunomide if needed.

Objective

The Sjögren's Syndrome Foundation clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are designed to improve quality and consistency of care in Sjögren's syndrome by offering recommendations for management.

Methods

Management questions for the systemic manifestations of Sjögren's syndrome were posed by the CPG committee with input from patients and rheumatologists. Clinical questions were assigned to a topic review group that performed systematic reviews and data extraction and drafted guidelines. Quality of evidence and strength of recommendation were rated using the American Society of Clinical Oncology's modification of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Guideline recommendations were reviewed by a consensus expert panel (CEP) composed of 30–40 clinicians from academia and community practices, as well as registered nurses and patients, using a modified Delphi process. A CEP agreement level of 75% was set as a minimum for adoption of a guideline recommendation.

Results

Consensus was achieved for 19 recommendations; for 11 additional modules, available data were insufficient to allow a recommendation to be formulated. Of the 19 recommendations, 15 required 1 Delphi round, 2 required 2 rounds, and 2 required 3 rounds.

Conclusion

Key recommendations include a decision tree for the use of oral disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs for inflammatory musculoskeletal pain, use of self-care measures and advice regarding exercise to reduce fatigue, and the use of rituximab in selected clinical settings for oral and ocular dryness and for certain extraglandular manifestations, including vasculitis, severe parotid swelling, inflammatory arthritis, pulmonary disease, and mononeuritis multiplex. The CPG committee strongly discouraged the use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors for sicca symptoms and for the majority of clinical contexts in primary Sjögren's syndrome.

### Current and future therapies for primary Sjögren syndrome [^0abcf20a]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Primary Sjögren syndrome (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease that is characterized by a triad of symptoms that affect all patients (dryness, pain and fatigue). In addition, systemic involvement can affect between one-third and one-half of patients. The management of patients with pSS has been negatively affected by a lack of effective treatments; however, knowledge of the epidemiology of pSS has increased, and advances in developing classification criteria, systemic disease activity scoring and patient-reported outcomes have been made during the past decade. Progress has also been made in understanding the mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of pSS, which has enabled a more targeted therapeutic approach to be taken. At present, therapeutic decisions rely on the evaluation of symptoms and systemic manifestations and are mostly formed on the basis of experience rather than evidence, and on similarities with other autoimmune diseases, although the 2019 management recommendations from EULAR are now being used to inform clinical management of pSS. This Review summarizes the available evidence for systemic treatments for pSS and includes discussions of advances in outcome assessment, the current evidence for DMARD use and an overview of promising future therapeutics.

Guideline development, search methodology and dates

This guideline was developed in line with the BSR Creating Guidelines protocol using AGREE II (Appraisal of guidelines for Research and Evaluation II) methodology. The working group had previously agreed the guideline scope and identified 19 key questions. Using these key questions as a basis a literature search was undertaken in a number of databases (see Supplementary Data S1, available at Rheumatology online). We restricted the search to human, English language and the date range 1 January 1990 to 1 December 2022. The eligible papers were reviewed, and draft recommendations developed. The original key questions were expanded where necessary to cover the breadth of the literature. The SIGN (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network) and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) processes were used to summarize the quality of the body of evidence for each recommendation as high (A), moderate (B) or low/very low (C) according to GRADE methodology. We have combined C (low) with D (very low) for the purposes of this guideline. Please note that C will include expert consensus where we could find no evidence within the literature.

Where there was no new evidence since the last guideline this is stated. The scope for this guideline is broader than that of the previous guideline. We have looked at additional facets of management and included children and adolescents in our recommendations. In developing the full guideline the lead author drafted the text and circulated it to the whole group. Suggested revisions were incorporated and the revised text circulated multiple times. Where there was disagreement a discussion was commenced via e-mail until a consensus could be reached. We also had two online teams meetings to debate and discuss various points. All authors agreed the final draft before submission.

The content, wording, strength of recommendation (strong = 1, conditional = 2) and Strength of Agreement (SOA) were determined by the working group responses. Only recommendations with a SOA > 80% were included.

### Sjögren's syndrome: state of the art on clinical practice guidelines [^10eae186]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Table 1
Currently available evidence-based medicine clinical practice guidelines on diagnosis and management of SS

Common aspects focused by the majority of CPGs include: (i) the need to reinforce patient education in terms of the disease itself and general measures of symptom relief and complications prevention; (ii) the importance of collaborative multidisciplinary care in diagnosis and follow-up of patients with SS; (iii) the central role of specialised assessment of patients with SS by physicians with expertise and experience in the disease and its various aspects.

Concerning diagnosis, the EULAR SS task force has provided recommendations for an adequate description of systemic involvement in primary SS, specifically for articular, cutaneous, pulmonary and renal manifestations. The main goals were to provide guidance on clear-cut definitions, prevalence, clinical characteristics and diagnostic approach of each of these organ-specific extraglandular manifestations. As part of the same effort, the authors planned three other manuscripts — not yet published, although preliminary data have been recently presented — addressing recommendation of symptomatic and general treatment as well as on treatment of specific complications (muscular, peripheral and central nervous system, haematological) included or not included in the EULAR SS Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) and lymphoproliferative disease. The same EULAR SS task force has elaborated a consensus set of recommendations that aid in the establishment of an early diagnosis of primary SS. They provide a homogeneous diagnostic approach to the patients with suspected primary SS based on the clinical presentation pattern, and specifically those presenting with systemic involvement.

Research recommendations

There are significant unmet needs in the management of this patient cohort. Further research into pathogenetic mechanisms may facilitate the development of targeted treatments. Accurate stratification of patients into disease subgroups and collaborative studies are essential to provide large enough cohorts to demonstrate meaningful effects of interventions. There is a need to develop better measures of disease activity as the currently used parameters do not include fatigue and dryness, underestimate the disease burden and are not sensitive to change. There is also a need to develop Quality Standards for SD to improve standards of care.

Clinicians' unmet needs

Guidelines proposing a systematic diagnostic approach of SS are needed, if possible mostly supported by solid data (vs expert consensus). This includes SS in general, and organ-specific manifestations not already covered by the available CPGs. A specific focus should be given to the use/usefulness and standardisation of diagnostic tools, including key ones such as minor salivary gland biopsy and salivary gland ultrasound and others with potentially less current impact like salivary gland scintigraphy and sialography.

Regarding treatment, as mentioned, there is an important unmet need to be able to recommend, or not, a DMARD that definitely changes the evolution of the disease in all patients or in a subgroup of patients. Thorough treatment guidance on each specific organ involvement and clear definitions of response/non-response, supported by SS studies, are warranted. Importantly, EBM recommendations for screening, identification and monitoring of patients at high risk of developing haematological malignant disorders (most importantly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) are also missing. Other important areas to be addressed by future guidelines include: evaluation/approach to cardiovascular risk; immunisation strategies of patients with SS; planning and management of pregnancy in patients with SS and strategies for assessment of patient burden and SS-related quality of life.

A number of unmet needs still exist for the disease and patients and significant efforts should be placed in order to identify effective symptomatic and systemic therapies and biomarkers for stratifying patients, predicting disease activity/severity and response to treatment. Validation of data arising from small studies should be performed in powerful clinical trials, and for that matter, development of tools that adequately capture the full picture of the disease and are sensitive to change is vital. The same applies to evidence imported from other CTDs, that should be replicated in patients with SS. Initiatives like the ongoing HarmonicSS project will contribute towards these aims, through the development of learning tools to expand the knowledge of SS for both clinicians and patients.

Regarding patient-reported outcomes (PRO), several aspects have to be developed. The ESSPRI score has the big advantage of being very simple and thus doable in less than 1 min during any patient consultation, but it is probably too reductive. Several aspects of fatigue (mental or physical), limb pain (musculoskeletal, neurological or fibromyalgia-like) and dryness should be developed. Likewise, personal patients' applications for measuring PRO more frequently (ie, on a weekly basis) should be developed and, indeed, this is one of the tasks of the NECESSITY Innovative Medical Initiative project in preparation from the European Commission.

Meta-analysis suggests an increase in cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity and a small excess mortality has been observed in people with SD, particularly in males and those with underlying lung disease. SD remains a chronic illness with no disease modifying or curative treatments available to date. People can accumulate morbidity over time.

SD may occur alone, when it has traditionally been referred to as primary SD, or alongside another rheumatic disease, when it may present as either an overlap or secondary phenomenon. The ACR/EULAR criteria are now widely used to classify people with primary SD and are often used diagnostically.

This guideline builds on, and widens the recommendations developed for the first guideline published in 2017. We have included advice on the management of children and adolescents with SD where appropriate to provide as comprehensive a guideline as possible for UK based rheumatology teams.

### Consensus guidelines for evaluation and management of pulmonary disease in Sjögren's [^2bc160f3]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Draft recommendations and strength of the recommendation were submitted to the CEP for consideration and approval, with at least 75% agreement required for inclusion in the manuscript. A clinical rationale for each recommendation and data extraction tables for articles used in developing the recommendations also were provided. The CEP, composed of 68 members (including 40 rheumatologists, 21 pulmonologists, and seven additional members, all of whom were Sjögren's patients or family of patients [e-Appendix 4]), voted on each recommendation using a six-point Likert scale, the strength of the recommendation (rating), and provided commentary for TRG review. If the consensus threshold was not met, the recommendation would be adjusted by the TRG until the consensus threshold was met. The commentary provided by the CEP was considered in the final wording of the recommendations and clinical rationales. Recommendations were again evaluated by the CEP following minor wording changes to better align with standard guideline language.

The formal consensus process was deemed especially critical in view of the lack of high-quality evidence. The guidelines committee utilized principles of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation, Agency for Health Research and Quality, and the US Preventive Services Task Force to formulate the methodology.

Potential gaps in current existing CPGs

We have identified a few potential gaps in current existing guidelines. Several key aspects regarding applicability, implementation (costs/resources) and monitoring/update plan of guidelines are generally missing in most available recommendations. This is important as the application of recommendations in clinical practice can be limited by local practices and rules (eg, cost, availability or approved indication of a given drug), that should thus be taken into account. A plan for monitoring the application and updating the guidelines should also be added, as per the best guidance on guideline elaboration methodology. We also consider that a better dissemination plan is needed for the current available guidelines, and that in some cases, the translation and/or adoption of these guidelines by other European countries would be helpful. Moreover, as mentioned above, a significant number of recommendations covering several areas of SS management and diagnosis are mostly based on expert consensus, considering the lack of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and high-quality observational studies for SS-related specific questions. Finally, it should be noted that 3/7 of the cited CPGs did not include patients' representatives in the working panel, a relevant aspect that needs to be taken into account when generating CPGs.

The results reported by the Efficacy and Safety of Belimumab in Subjects with Primary Sjögren's Syndrome (BELISS) open-label trialin 30 primary-2002 patients (all with systemic complications, early disease and/or abnormal biomarkers) showed that belimumab 10 mg/kg (weeks 0, 2 and 4, and then every 4 weeks until week 24) was associated with a higher rate of improvement in the composite outcome (improvement of at least two of the five following items: ≥ 30% reduction in VAS for dryness, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain and physician systemic activity, and ≥ 25% reduction in any of the B-cell activation biomarkers) in patients with early disease in comparison with those with systemic disease (73% vs 47%); the mean ESSDAI score decreased from 8.8 to 5.59 (p < 0.0001) and the ESSPRI score from 6.44 to 5.56 (p = 0.01). In the 19 patients who completed 1 year of treatment, a significant improvement in some ESSDAI involvements (glandular, lymphadenopathy and articular) was maintained. With respect to the safety profile, only one serious adverse event was reported (pneumococcal meningitis) after six drug infusions.

Epratuzumab

In 2006, a small prospective study including 15 patients with primary-2002 SjSreported a beneficial effect on VAS fatigue (< 0.05), patient assessment (< 0.05), physician assessment (< 0.05) and tender joints (< 0.05); five patients experienced severe adverse events (acute infusion reactions and infections).

Etanercept

Two studies (one RCT, one prospective) have been carried out in SjS patients; only the prospective study included primary-2002 patients and showed no significant improvements in the main sicca signs and symptoms.

Infliximab

A prospective open-label study in 16 patients found significant improvements in subjective and objective measures after the administration of INF, although recently the authors have retracted the manuscript. In 2004, Mariette et al conducted an RCT including 103 patients and found no significant differences in the primary outcome, defined as improvement in at least 30% of the joint pain, fatigue and dryness VAS at 22 weeks (INF 20.4% vs PLA 16.7%, p = 0.62) or in the majority of secondary outcomes (symptoms, salivary flow rates, ocular tests, QoL and salivary biopsy), with improvement only in fatigue and some analytical parameters in comparison with PLA.

### Consensus guidelines for evaluation and management of pulmonary disease in Sjögren's [^d18e0848]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

A rigorous and transparent methodology was followed according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines. The methodology employed for these guidelines was first developed and used by the Foundation for recommendations for rheumatologic management in Sjogren'sand included direction from the ACR as well as other guidelines methodology consultants. The Pulmonary Topic Review Group (TRG) included equal parts rheumatologists and pulmonologists (n = 4 each) and one hematologist-oncologist as well as participation and oversight by a rheumatologist chair for all Foundation guidelines and a rheumatology/systemic symptoms guidelines chair. The TRG defined systematic review parameters and end points (e-Appendix 1), including MEDLINE/PubMed peer-reviewed articles in English between January 1, 1990, and February 1, 2020, and studies with Sjögren's patients classified or diagnosed by any published set of criteria. Although currently either the 2002 American-European Consensus Groupor the 2016 ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)classification criteria for primary Sjögren's are utilized most often, a number of criteria have been used historically.

An outline with clinical questions was developed based on the PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) format (e-Appendix 2). For the systematic review, literature search terms were compiled by the TRG, and the searches were executed by a librarian (e-Appendix 1). Each article was reviewed by a minimum of two TRG members for eligibility and assessment of quality of evidence. Full data were extracted into four tables: Study Characteristics, Sample and Disease, Evidence, and Quality. The Quality table rated the overall quality of each study according to criteria related to study design and the risk of bias used in recommendation development.

Guidelines were drafted based on available evidence using a strength of the evidence rating (e-Appendix 3), the expertise of the TRG and Consensus Expert Panel (CEP) members who reviewed the recommendations, and clinical importance. Each recommendation also was rated for the strength of the recommendation, which was gauged by the TRG based on a combination of available evidence as well as the confidence level that the recommendation offers the best current guidance for practice.

### Sjögren's syndrome: state of the art on clinical practice guidelines [^d37f735c]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a complex autoimmune rheumatic disease that specifically targets salivary and lachrymal glands. As such, patients typically had ocular and oral dryness and salivary gland swelling. Moreover, skin, nasal and vaginal dryness are frequently present. In addition to dryness, musculoskeletal pain and fatigue are the hallmarks of this disease and constitute the classic symptom triad presented by the vast majority of patients. Up to 30% to 50% of patients with SS may present systemic disease; moreover, there is an increased risk for the development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that occurs in a minority of patients. The present work was developed in the framework of the European Reference Network (ERN) dedicated to Rare and Complex Connective Tissue and Musculoskeletal Diseases (ReCONNET). In line with its goals of aiming to improve early diagnosis, treatment and care of rare connective and musculoskeletal diseases, ERN-ReCONNET set to review the current state of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in the rare and complex connective tissue diseases of interest of the network. Therefore, the present work was aimed at providing a state of the art of CPGs for SS.

### Sjögren's syndrome: state of the art on clinical practice guidelines [^0f0e925c]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

We carried out a systematic search in Medline (PubMed) and Embase based on controlled terms (MeSH and Emtree) and keywords of this disease (SS) and publication type (CPGs). We reviewed all the published articles in order to identify existing CPGs on diagnosis, monitoring and treatment, according to thedefinition: clinical practice guidelines are statements that include recommendations intended to optimise patient care that are informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options.

The DCs of the ERN-ReCONNET for SS have assigned the work on CPGs to the 14 healthcare providers (HCPs) involved, from seven European countries (France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Portugal, Romania and Slovenia). Moreover, in order to complement the list of guidelines provided by Medline and Embase search, the group also performed a hand search on a number of national and international websites relevant in the field of SS and/or clinical guidance. After a first screening among papers included in the final list (systematic search+hand search) based on title and abstract, full text evaluation was conducted to select EBM guidelines. A general assessment of the CPGs was performed based on the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II instrumentnot for formal appraisal but only to inform discussion. The final goal was to perform a broad assessment of current guidelines on SS, with input of all HCPs, that would serve as basis to define unmet needs. For this matter, a discussion group was set for the evaluation of the existing CPGs and identification of unmet needs.

### Efficacy and safety of topical and systemic medications: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of Sjögren's syndrome [^ea5c1983]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

A MEDLINE SLR was carried out by PB-Z and SR using the MeSH term 'Sjögren's syndrome' combined with each therapeutic intervention proposed by the Task Force (see 'Intervention' section of the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes and Study design (PICOS) strategy) with the following restrictions: date (1 January 1986 to 31 December 2017), studies (humans) and age (adults). Additional databases, such as EMBASE and Cochrane Central Library, were also checked. The SLR strategy followed prespecific PICOS definitions agreed by the Steering Committee members: (a) Population: in order to collect evidence from an aetiopathogenically homogeneous population, data was retrieved from studies including adult primary SjS patients fulfilling the 2002 criteria (stated in the manuscript as 'primary-2002' patients) or the 2016 ACR/EULAR criteria; (b) Intervention: using the data from a 2010 SLR as a starting point, interventions were classified as topical or systemic medications; (c) Comparison: therapeutic interventions were compared with placebo (PLA) or other therapeutic interventions; (d) Outcomes: eligible studies had to contain sufficient, clear information on the effect of the therapeutic intervention (efficacy) and on the safety profile; (e) Study design: we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies (prospective non-PLA-controlled, non-randomised studies and those with quasi-experimental designs), case-control studies (comparing therapeutic options) and meta-analyses, according to the definitions proposed by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM), while case series (descriptive/retrospective therapeutic studies) were considered in the absence of other studies; narrative reviews, experimental animal studies, duplicate publications and isolated case reports were excluded. In the absence of evidence on the target population, extrapolation of results from studies including SjS populations that differed from the definition in the PICOS strategy was allowed. Figure 1 summarises the SLR results. Summary-of-finding tables were generated for RCTs (table 1), prospective cohort studies (table 2)and case-control studies (table 3). For RCTs, the risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using the Cochrane RoB assessment tool (Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions V.5.1.0 March 2011 (available from:)), and for uncontrolled studies, we used the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement checklist. The few RCTs available for each therapeutic intervention, together with the heterogeneity in the methodology of the studies included, such as differing participant characteristics, comparative interventions, the small size of the populations studied and the differences in follow-up intervals and outcomes measured, make it impossible to pool data in a meta-analysis.

### Consensus guidelines for evaluation and management of pulmonary disease in Sjögren's [^208cba27]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Sjögren's pulmonary guidelines — consensus development and evidence synthesis — report that the Treatment Recommendations Group (TRG) originally developed 85 topics/questions, then used predefined searches that identified 1,192 articles, of which 178 abstracts were selected and 150 qualified for data extraction; the TRG then generated 52 recommendations, and consensus agreement on the 102 questions exceeded the required 75% threshold after one round with a range of 79% to 100% and an average of nearly 98%; the Clinical Expert Panel (CEP), composed of 68 members (including 40 rheumatologists, 21 pulmonologists, and seven additional members, all of whom were Sjögren's patients or family of patients), voted with at least 75% agreement required for inclusion, and CEP commentary led to rewording 12 recommendations and 13 clinical rationales; because the recommendations were intended to be wide-reaching, the authors preferred to make firm recommendations and avoided vaguer terms such as "may be considered" when reasonable.

Patients' unmet needs

This paragraph intends to highlight the unmet needs of the Sjögren's Syndrome European community. The content of this paragraph has been realised by the ERN ReCONNET European Patient Advocacy Group that carefully collected the voices and the points of view of the whole European community of the disease they represent.

Finding a physician that understands Sjögren is still a big challenge nowadays, and this is probably the underlying cause of the most prevalent reported unmet need: delay to diagnosis. Patients are often dismissed because doctors can't relate symptoms, or they are not taken seriously. Consequently, lack of understanding from family, friends and employers paves the way to a heavy emotional burden, not to mention disease progression-related issues.

Besides early diagnosis, delay to treatment is the second most widespread unmet need. It's not clear if doctors don't know how to treat Sjögren's or if it's seen exclusively as a dry eyed and dry mouth disease. Whether we need combination therapies or new therapeutic targets, the fact is effective and specific treatment lacks, and treatments for Sjögren are largely symptomatic. Sjögren's has been an orphan disease in what concerns to specific drugs approval, so establishing rational targets for drug development is a must. Being a highly heterogenous disease, even at molecular level, shows the need for stratification and tailored treatment strategy. In this concern, genetics must be understood as it seems to play an important role.

Fatigue, pain and cognitive dysfunction, often seen as "benign features", are the cause of greatest patient-reported disability. Understanding how these symptoms truly impact patients' lives and clarifying if depression results from disease activity, or is fatigue related, is a big challenge that urgently needs to be addressed. Disease self-management programme — patient education; lifestyle guidelines — along with non-pharmacological approaches — exercise; meditation; occupational therapies — are interesting resources that lack to be explored and can be key to restore quality of life. There's life beyond the disease and patients deserve to live it at its fullest, but they need to be empowered to know how to manage it in all circumstances.

Finally, more reliable information is needed to address the lack of knowledge from HCPs, public, family, friends and employers.

State of the art on CPGs

The flow diagram adapted from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement for the identification of EBM CPGs on SS is represented in figure 1. Systematic database search identified 742 records that together with 35 records retrieved through manual search led to a total of 777 references for screening. Title and abstract screening was then conducted by HCP representatives, excluding 696 records. A total of 81 articles were eligible for full text assessment, of which 68 were excluded. Main reasons for exclusion included articles not related to SS (ie, wrong patients' population) and article type other than guidelines (ie, original research or review manuscripts). A few articles were recommendations not supported by SLR, which were thus not EBM CPGs, the main focus of the present work. Finally, six papers were excluded as duplicates. In the end, seven articles were identified as EBM CPGs and included for further analysis.

Figure 1
Flow diagram representing the search strategy for evidence-based medicine clinical practice guidelines on Sjögren's syndrome. Adapted from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement by Moher et al.

The major topics of the included CPGs are summarised in table 1. We found high-quality EBM up-to-date guidelines on diagnosis (specifically addressing four extraglandular domains) and treatment/management (both of glandular and extraglandular manifestationsthat have all been recently published in the last 3 years by European (European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) SS task force; UK), American (USA) and Latin American (Brazil) societies/organisations. All of these presented high-quality methodology, were based on a thorough SLR and presented in a clear, appropriate way, with adequate, comprehensive recommendations relevant for clinical practice. Three other guidelines provided important information on early diagnosis of SSor management of dryness, and were evaluated as being of good overall quality, although in some instances based on a less robust methodological process. Of note, most of the analysed recommendations were often based on expert opinion, rather than solid evidence, considering the lack of high-quality studies that is seen in a number of areas of interest in SS.

### International consensus: what else can we do to improve diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in patients affected by autoimmune rheumatic diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritides, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome and Sjögren's syndrome)? the unmet needs and the clinical Grey zone in autoimmune disease management [^09b2c51e]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Autoimmune diseases are a complex set of diseases characterized by immune system activation and, although many progresses have been done in the last 15years, several unmet needs in the management of these patients may be still identified. Recently, a panel of international Experts, divided in different working groups according to their clinical and scientific expertise, were asked to identify, debate and formulate a list of key unmet needs within the field of rheumatology, serving as a roadmap for research as well as support for clinicians. After a systematic review of the literature, the results and the discussions from each working group were summarised in different statements. Due to the differences among the diseases and their heterogeneity, a large number of statements was produced and voted by the Experts to reach a consensus in a plenary session. At all the steps of this process, including the initial discussions by the steering committee, the identification of the unmet needs, the expansion of the working group and finally the development of statements, a large agreement was attained. This work confirmed that several unmet needs may be identified and despite the development of new therapeutic strategies as well as a better understanding of the effects of existing therapies, many open questions still remain in this field, suggesting a research agenda for the future and specific clinical suggestions which may allow physicians to better manage those clinical conditions still lacking of scientific clarity.

19. What age-tailored information, education and support do people with SD and their families and carers need and how can they access this?

Analysis of a comprehensive survey of individuals with SD undertaken by the USA based charity — the Sjogren's Foundation — found that the most frequent extraglandular symptoms included fatigue, dry/itchy skin and morning stiffness. They found a high burden of disease and identified that the top three symptoms or signs that individuals with SD hope new treatments will address are dryness, fatigue, and reduction in lymphoma or blood cancer risk.

The high symptom burden was confirmed in a qualitative study which included moderated online discussion forums and one-to-one questionnaires. In this study fatigue was rated as the most severe and burdensome symptom.

Significant unmet needs have been identified within Europe for those with SD and their families/carers and efforts are underway to address this.

A qualitative focus group study involving individuals with SD and their spouses found that they wanted tailored support from healthcare professionals, including information provision, access to peer support and professional support. The authors proposed a three-step model of care comprising written information, education groups, peer support, digital self-management and one-to-one therapy.

In a study of 98 women with SD those who demonstrated adaptive coping strategies had better sexual function and lower levels of sexual distress than those with maladaptive coping strategies and the authors suggested that the development of psychosocial or interpersonal interventions for individuals with SD were warranted.

There has been work in the UK to develop a non-pharmacological intervention model to improve QoL in SD.

A review of the resources available on YouTube for SD found approximately half of the videos (51.4%) to be useful, with 8.6% providing misleading content. The authors concluded that people should be directed towards validated resources and that specialists should actively participate in the development of video-sharing platforms.

Patients benefit from a holistic review taking into account their ocular, oral and systemic symptoms and addressing their individual needs.

Recommendation

Provide written information on the manifestations of SD and their management, direct individuals with SD to appropriate online resources and recommend they access local and national support groups, e.g. Sjogren's UK Home — Sjögren's UK (sjogrensuk.org), Sjogren's Foundation, Versus Arthritis and NHS websites (2, C) (SOA 97.1%).

### Executive summary: British Society for Rheumatology guideline on management of adult and juvenile onset Sjögren disease [^f45ffbfa]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendation

Systemic steroids may be used short-term for specific indications but should not be offered routinely in the management of SD (2, C) SOA 97.7%

Conventional immunosuppressive drugs

Aside from hydroxychloroquine there have been several low-quality studies looking at other immunosuppressives. All were small, mostly not RCT and most showed no benefit. The evidence for the use of immunosuppressive drugs other than hydroxychloroquine is poor and individual practice varies considerably. We would recommend that any treatment decisions are made on a case-by-case basis. Most of the conventional DMARDs can be used off-label in children from the age of two years with the exception of leflunomide which is not approved for use in people younger than 18 years.

Recommendation

Conventional immunosuppressive drugs are not routinely recommended for use in SD outside of the treatment of specific systemic complications (2, C) SOA 94.7%

Treatment of systemic disease: biologic drugs

Biologics are not NICE-approved for SD. Of the few patients who do get biologics, this is usually either as part of a clinical trial or because they meet criteria for RA or another CTD (usually SLE).

With the exception of rituximab and belimumab, the evidence base for biologics in SD is unconvincing although a number of studies are currently underway looking at a range of biologic agents. Open label and phase II studies of belimumab alone and in combination with rituximab have demonstrated small improvements in ESSDAI score from baseline. The European guidelines have suggested belimumab as rescue therapy in those with severe systemic disease refractory to conventional immunosuppression and rituximab.

Two systematic reviews and a meta-analysis of rituximab treatment for SD found weak evidence of benefit but insufficient evidence to support routine use. It may have a role to play in patients with specific organ manifestations including ILD. The North American guideline group recommend rituximab for systemic complications and the most recent European guidelines recommend rituximab for patients with severe, refractory systemic disease.

No studies have been performed in jSD, although rituximab may be used off-label for specific indications from 3–6 months, and belimumab from five years of age. Rituximab has been prescribed by paediatricians for selected jSD cases, with 40% of surveyed clinicians stating that they have used it for systemic manifestations and 9% for recurrent parotitis. Rituximab has also been found beneficial in treating MALT lymphoma and neurological manifestations in children as per various case reports. An NHS commissioning policy in 2016 declined to fund rituximab for patients with SD in England and Wales.

Rituximab

An initial open label study of rituximab in a small cohort of those with early SD confirmed effective B-cell depletion and appeared to demonstrate clinical improvement, especially in those with residual glandular function. This was followed by a flurry of case reports and small case series reporting successful treatment of systemic complications including lymphoma, immune thrombocytopaenia, cryoglobulinaemia, lung disease, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and neurological disease in SD. Two small RCTs over 24 and 48 weeks suggested beneficial effects on fatigue and salivary flow rates. However, neither of the subsequent larger phase III placebo-controlled trials reached their primary endpoint evaluating patient-reported improvements in pain, fatigue and dryness. The TEARS study included 120 individuals with active disease randomized to either two infusions of rituximab 2 weeks apart or placebo. This study failed to achieve a significant improvement in VAS measures of dryness, global disease activity, fatigue and pain, despite an improvement in salivary flow rates and a measurable laboratory response. The TRACTISS trial of 133 individuals gave two infusions of rituximab at baseline and repeated at 6 months. Again, there were no significant improvements in outcomes overall although the authors noted a small improvement in unstimulated salivary flow rates. However, post hoc assessment of the TRACTISS trial data showed that CRESS response rates at the primary endpoint visits were 49% (33 of 67) for rituximab vs 30% (20 of 66) for placebo (P = 0.026).

Two systematic reviews and a meta-analysis of rituximab treatment for SD concluded that although there was some weak evidence of an improvement in lacrimal gland function there was no overall evidence of improvement in oral dryness, fatigue or QoL, and insufficient evidence to support routine use. There is some evidence, however, that it may have a role to play in those with specific organ manifestations including ILD. The North American guideline group concluded that there was sufficient evidence to suggest rituximab when conventional therapies, including immunomodulators, had proven insufficient. They recommended that it was considered for those with a range of systemic complications including vasculitis, severe parotid swelling, inflammatory arthritis, pulmonary disease and peripheral neuropathy. The most recent European guidelines have suggested that rituximab may be considered for severe, refractory systemic disease, especially those with cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis.

Rituximab has also been commonly prescribed by paediatricians for selected jSD cases, with 40% of the surveyed clinicians stating that they have used it for systemic manifestations and 9% for recurrent parotitis. Rituximab has also been found to be beneficial in treating MALT lymphoma and neurological manifestations in children as per various case reports.

What is the most clinically effective stimulatory treatment for oral dryness?

Two large RCTs confirmed significant improvement in oral dryness and salivary flow rates with pilocarpine but side effects were common.

Recommendation

Consider a trial of pilocarpine (5 mg once daily increasing to 5 mg tds/qds) in those with significant oral sicca symptoms with evidence of residual glandular function (1, A) SOA 98.4%

9b. What is the clinical effectiveness of fluoride, xylitol, chlorhexidine, artificial saliva or diet in preventing the development or progression of dental caries and gum disease?

None of the published evidence is SD-specific and much is old. Most of the evidence relates to children and adolescents with little evidence in adults. There is evidence supporting fluoride toothpaste and xylitol in caries prevention but little evidence of benefit to chlorhexidene.

Recommendation

Recommend regular brushing with fluoride toothpaste, proactive dental care and the use of xylitol-containing products as an alternative to sugar to prevent dental decay (2, C) SOA 95.6%

10a. In people with SD, what is the clinical effectiveness of treatments in comparison to each other or placebo for treating systemic disease?

Systemic (extra-glandular) features are seen in up to 70% of patients with SD and are severe in 15%. Most commonly involved organs are joints, lungs, skin and peripheral nerves.

Conventional immunomodulatory drugs

Hydroxychloroquine

There is some weak evidence of benefit for hydroxychloroquine, but no new studies since the last guideline was published.

Recommendation

In those with significant fatigue and systemic symptoms, consider a trial of hydroxychloroquine for 6–12 months (2, C) SOA 95.6%

Corticosteroids

There are case reports and small case series suggesting that corticosteroids help certain systemic features but no good evidence of benefit in general.

Other important tools and resources

Despite not constituting the main aim of the present SLR, a number of other tools and resources important in SS clinical practice were identified and deserve mention. International collaborations have successfully led to the creation of classification criteria for SS that have been widely used in the past two decades, of which the most commonly employed are the American European Consensus Group 2002 criteriaand the preliminary American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2012 criteria. Recently, ACR and EULAR have joined efforts to develop a single set of data-driven consensus classification criteria for primary SS, that may replace the former. Importantly, these classification criteria are primarily oriented for enrolment of patients in clinical trials, although being frequently used for guiding diagnosis in clinical practice.

In the past decade, the EULAR SS task force committed to developing clinical tools that reflect the complex nature of SS. From this initiative, important instruments have emerged, including the ESSDAI, which assesses systemic disease activity in its several domains, and the EULAR SS Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI), which translates the most common symptoms reported by patients (pain, dryness, fatigue). These indexes have been posteriorly complemented with a very useful user guide, definitions of disease activity states and clinically meaningful improvementand a simpler, clinical only version. This comprehensive effort has resulted in the fast and widespread incorporation of these tools in clinical practice and research, significantly improving care of patients with SS. Together with pre-existent resources for evaluating and scoring damage developed by European groups, they have successfully contributed for a global overview of the impact of SS at the individual patient level.

Other important resources including guidance and recommendations for key areas like salivary gland biopsyand ultrasoundand a list of patient organisations devoted to SS are available at the SS disease info toolbox of the ERN-ReCONNET website.

Primary Sjögren's syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease whose clinical spectrum extends from sicca syndrome to systemic involvement (extraglandular manifestations). Recent reports have focused on expanding the clinical characterization and improving the diagnostic and therapeutic management of systemic Sjögren's.

Recent Findings

The development of the EULAR-SS disease activity index represents a step forward in the evaluation of systemic Sjögren's, and three multicenter studies including more than 2500 European patients have confirmed that primary Sjögren's syndrome is, undeniably, a systemic autoimmune disease. Systemic involvement plays a key role in the prognosis of primary Sjögren's syndrome, and recent studies have focused on cutaneous, pulmonary, renal and neurological disease features. Other studies comparing the two sets of Sjögren's syndrome criteria (American College of Rheumatology vs. American-European Consensus Group) in real-life patients found a moderate level of agreement. Autoantibodies are clues to an early diagnosis, as positivity confirms an autoimmune origin of the sicca syndrome and may appear several years before the disease diagnosis. In patients with a high clinical suspicion and negative results for the standard determination of anti-Ro/SS-A antibodies, specific detection of anti-Ro52/60 antibodies is recommended. Direct and indirect B-cell blocking seems to be the most promising biological pathway in primary Sjögren's syndrome, especially for systemic involvement, although a large controlled trial has failed to demonstrate the efficacy of rituximab for nonsystemic symptomatology (dryness, fatigue and pain).

Summary

Dryness of the mucosal surfaces is the pivotal, but not only, clinical involvement that characterizes primary Sjögren's syndrome. There is growing interest in and knowledge of the clinical characterization and therapeutic management of systemic Sjögren's.

### Diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome: American-European and the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria [^9518bb3d]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Classification criteria provide a formalized approach to studying course and management of rheumatic disease, as well as a measure of improvement in care. Understanding the purposes of classification criteria sets and the differences between different classification criteria is crucial for understanding rheumatic disease and for the design and conduct of clinical and epidemiologic investigations. In this article, the similarities and differences between the American-European Consensus Group Criteria (AECG) and the newly proposed American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for Sjögren's syndrome and the clinical implications of switching to the ACR classification criteria from the AECG are described.

Recommendation

In those with significant fatigue and systemic symptoms consider a trial of HCQ for 6–12 months (2, C) (SOA 95.6%).

Corticosteroids

There are case reports and small case series suggesting that CS (e.g. prednisolone and prednisone) help certain systemic features including lung disease, cytopaenias, and, in combination with CYC, neurological involvement. A small open-label study of low dose prednisolone (5–7.5 mg per day) in just 20 individuals in a single centre showed improvements in sicca symptoms and modest improvements in salivary flow. The North American and European guidelines recommend short-term CS use if required but in general urge the use of steroid-sparing agents if use continues. There is no good evidence of benefit in general, but steroids remain widely used for specific systemic manifestations, including renal involvement, and as short courses for parotid swelling.

Recommendation

Systemic steroids may be used short term for specific indications but should not be offered routinely in the management of SD (2, C) (SOA 97.7%).

Treatment of systemic disease – conventional immunosuppressive drugs

The evidence base for the use of immunosuppressive drugs other than HCQ in SD is poor and individual practice varies considerably. We summarize the available evidence below but would recommend that any decisions on the use of immunosuppressive drugs are made on a case-by-case basis.

Aside from HCQ there have been a number of relatively low-quality studies looking at the use of other immunosuppressives. All were small, mostly not RCT and most showed no benefit.

AZA has been reported as helpful in case reports for systemic complications such as lung disease, myelopathy and cytopaenias, but an RCT suggested that it did not have a routine role in treatment and was associated with a high frequency of side effects. The Japanese guideline did not recommend AZA and other guidelines suggest it only when other treatment strategies have failed or where a steroid-sparing effect is required.

### Clinical manifestations and early diagnosis of Sjögren syndrome… [^19485431]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Sjögren syndrome is a common autoimmune disease evidenced by broad organ-specific and systemic manifestations, the most prevalent being diminished lacrimal and salivary gland function, xerostomia, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, and parotid gland enlargement. Primary SS presents alone, and secondary SS occurs in connection with autoimmune rheumatic diseases. In addition, symptoms do not always present concurrently. This diversity of symptomatic expression adds to the difficulty in initial diagnosis. Armed with the recently refined criteria for diagnosis, specialists, such as rheumatologists, primary care physicians, ophthalmologists, and dentists, who would otherwise focus only on those symptoms that encompass their areas of expertise, can get a comprehensive image of the presenting patient, leading to earlier identification and treatment of SS.

Sjögren syndrome is a common, slowly progressive autoimmune disease that exhibits a wide range of organ-specific and systemic manifestations. B-cell activation is a consistent finding in patients with SS, and B and T cells invade and destroy target organs. Patients with SS have symptoms related to diminished lacrimal and salivary gland function and frequently present with xerostomia, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, and parotid gland enlargement. Although SS affects approximately 2% of the adult population, 1 it remains undiagnosed in more than half. Sjögren syndrome can occur alone or in association with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Because the variegated symptoms of SS are not always present at the same time, physicians and dentists sometimes treat each symptom individually, unaware that a systemic disease is present.

In the past, people with SS were frequently misdiagnosed because their symptoms were considered minor or vague or mimicked those of other diseases. Consequently, the interval between the onset of SS and its diagnosis is frequently long — 10 years, on average, according to one estimate.
8. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential for optimal management of SS. This article will present current data on the pathophysiology, clinical complaints, diagnosis, and often neglected treatment of this disease, the onset of which is typically insidious. An estimated 2 to 4 million persons in the United States have SS. Approximately 1 million have an established diagnosis; however, because of the heterogeneity and often nonspecific nature of its clinical manifestations, it is likely that the disease remains undiagnosed in most cases.

Sjögren syndrome primarily affects women, with a female-male ratio of 9: 1, and may occur in patients of all ages but typically has its onset in the fourth to sixth decades of life. Sjögren syndrome is a systemic disease strongly associated with organ-specific and systemic autoimmunity. For example, thyroid dysfunction and/or autoimmune thyroid disease was found in 45% of one series of patients with primary SS. 17 Vascular involvement in patients with SS may result in peripheral neuropathy, glomerulonephritis, and gastrointestinal lesions. 3 Numerous systemic manifestations of SS exist that can contribute to difficulty of diagnosis. Extreme, debilitating fatigue occurs in approximately 50% of patients with primary SS, 18 and many patients find this feature of the disease more troublesome than the exocrine symptoms. Patients spend several extra hours in bed trying to rest or sleep, but most report that they do not feel refreshed on awakening.

### Efficacy of pharmacological interventions: a systematic review informing the 2023 EULAR recommendations for the management of fatigue in people with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases [^0d34bdec]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (I-RMDs) include a set of chronic, inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), gout, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), Sjogren's syndrome (SjS), idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), vasculitis and undifferentiated arthritis, among others. I-RMDs can affect the joints, bones, cartilage, ligaments, tendons, muscles, glands, skin and other organs or systems. They are typically chronic conditions that impose a heavy burden on people's life and can impair daily self-care and quality of life. I-RMDs often require complex treatment regimens, which, if started early, reduce the risk of long-term structural damage, the need for surgeries and the number of complications.

Fatigue is one of the most common and can be one of the most debilitating symptoms of I-RMD. An international consensus statement has proposed that it should be measured in all RA clinical trials, and international delegates at Outcome Measures in Rheumatology eighth meeting endorsed fatigue as an addition to the 'core set' of outcome measures for all future RA studies. Nevertheless, there is still a significant unmet need in the management of fatigue, which is mainly due to the lack of evidence on the cost-effectiveness of providing fatigue therapies using different treatment modalities, the lack of training available for healthcare professionals to provide evidence-based fatigue therapies, and the complexity of fatigue itself, since it is a multidimensional symptom that varies from patient-to-patient and over time, making it more difficult to manage effectively.

### Primary Sjögren's syndrome | NEJM resident 360… [^962a1973]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published March 7, 2018 Primary Sjögren's syndrome is a common systemic autoimmune disease, with a female-to-male predominance of 9: 1 and peak incidence at approximately 50 years of age. The hallmark of the disease is exocrinopathy, which often results in dryness of the mouth and eyes, fatigue, and joint pain. These three symptoms are present in more than 80% of the patients with this disease. Read the latest NEJM Clinical Practice article here. A: Systemic manifestations occur in approximately 30 to 40% of the patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome. Lymphocytic infiltration of the epithelia of organs beyond the exocrine glands can cause interstitial nephritis, autoimmune primary biliary cholangitis, and obstructive bronchiolitis.

Immune complex deposition as a result of the ongoing B-cell hyperreactivity can result in extraepithelial manifestations, such as palpable purpura, cryoglobulinemia-associated glomerulonephritis, interstitial pneumonitis, and peripheral neuropathy. A: The risk of B-cell lymphoma is 15 to 20 times as high among patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome as in the general population, a finding that has been attributed to the chronic B-cell activation in this condition. These lymphomas are mostly B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, with a predominance of the low-grade, marginal-zone histologic type. Lymphomas often develop in organs in which primary Sjögren's syndrome is active, such as the salivary glands, and thus are primarily mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas.

A: Anti-SSA antibodies are present in two thirds of patients and should be assessed when primary Sjögren's syndrome is suspected. Rheumatoid factor is present in approximately half of the patients, whereas antibodies against double-stranded DNA are typically absent. Biopsy of minor salivary glands is typically recommended for establishing a diagnosis of primary Sjögren's syndrome in the absence of anti-SSA antibodies. Measures of oral and ocular dryness may also be useful. Ultrasonography of the major salivary glands may reveal multiple hypochoic or anechoic areas in the four main salivary glands and may be helpful in diagnosis or longitudinal assessment, although such evaluation is not formally included among the classification criteria.

A: A systematic review of randomized clinical trials has shown the benefit of muscarinic agonists for the treatment of oral dryness and, to a lesser extent, ocular dryness in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome. The use of topical cyclosporine eyedrops has been shown to result in better tear production than placebo and in improvement in symptom scores among patients with moderate or severe ocular dryness and inflammation, although such findings have been mixed. Randomized trials assessing the efficacy of analgesic drugs in primary Sjögren's syndrome are lacking. On the basis of clinical experience, simple analgesics may be used as first-line therapy for pain; nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may be appropriate for joint pain.

### Health-related quality of life and costs in Sjögren's syndrome [^67b12e35]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has an increasing role in medical decision-making. This review of the literature aims to provide an overview on HRQoL, costs, and work disability in SS, a disease characterized by focal lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands with no therapeutics of proven immunomodulatory potential. HRQoL is markedly reduced in SS in multiple studies across many countries when compared with HRQoL in healthy controls. The reduction in HRQoL is similar to that observed in other chronic diseases such as RA, SLE, FM and, interestingly, non-SS sicca syndrome. Impaired HRQoL in SS has been found to be associated with fatigue, pain/articular involvement, ocular and oral involvement, pruritus, sexual dysfunction, impaired sleep, pulmonary manifestations, psychological dysfunction and impaired physical function. Until now, no therapeutic has been shown to improve HRQoL in an adequately powered double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial. Although primary SS does not, in general, impair life expectancy and is often inappropriately considered a benign 'nuisanvce' disease for those patients without systemic manifestations, the associated costs and work disability are striking. This, together with the significant reduction in HRQoL, strongly argues for the development of new therapeutic approaches to manage this neglected disease.

### British Society for Rheumatology guideline on management of adult and juvenile onset Sjögren disease [^8086937b]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Sjögren disease (SD) is a chronic, autoimmune disease of unknown aetiology with significant impact on quality of life. Although dryness (sicca) of the eyes and mouth are the classically described features, dryness of other mucosal surfaces and systemic manifestations are common. The key management aim should be to empower the individual to manage their condition — conserving, replacing and stimulating secretions; and preventing damage and suppressing systemic disease activity. This guideline builds on and widens the recommendations developed for the first guideline published in 2017. We have included advice on the management of children and adolescents where appropriate to provide a comprehensive guideline for UK-based rheumatology teams.

### Hydroxychloroquine treatment downregulates systemic interferon activation in primary Sjögren's syndrome in the JOQUER randomized trial [^e694ac9f]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary SS (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease with characteristic local dryness of the eyes and mouth. Additionally, systemic complications are frequently observed and include multi-organ involvement and fatigue. There is no cure for pSS and treatment options focus on symptom relief, prevention of systemic damage and improvement of quality of life. HCQ is an immunomodulatory drug listed as first line treatment in The Sjögren's Syndrome Foundation Clinical Practice Guidelines, and is usually prescribed for arthralgias, myalgias and sometimes for fatigue. Evidence regarding the efficacy of HCQ, however, is limited. The JOQUER randomized placebo-controlled trial (Gottenberg et al. JAMA 2014, clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00632866) assessed the efficacy of a 24-week HCQ (400 mg/d) treatment in patients with pSS. Disease activity [as assessed by EULAR SS disease activity index (ESSDAI)] and patient-reported symptoms of dryness, pain or fatigue [assessed by the EULAR SS Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI)] did not improve in HCQ-treated pSS patients compared with placebo treatment.

Systemic upregulation of the expression of Toll-like receptor 7, chronic activation of the type I IFN (IFN-I) pathway and upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) is present in a subgroup of pSS patients. Among the ISGs are several RNA- and DNA-sensing receptors. Triggering of these sensors by their ligands will result in further stimulation of IFN-I production and induction of a pathogenic loop. HCQ blocks among others TLR7 activation, thereby preventing production of IFNs and induction of ISGs via this route. Here we investigated the effect of HCQ treatment on expression levels of ISGs in whole blood RNA of pSS patients enrolled in the JOQUER trial. Patients were stratified as IFN-I positive or negative. Subsequently, the effect of HCQ treatment on disease activity and objective and subjective clinical parameters in IFN-I positive and negative pSS patients was studied.

### How to treat Sjögren's syndrome [^6b588229]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

SS is a chronic, autoimmune disease of unknown aetiology for which there is no known curative treatment. Although dryness of the eyes and mouth are the classically described features, patients often experience drying of other mucosal surfaces and systemic manifestations, including fatigue and arthralgia. There is an association with other autoimmune diseases, especially thyroid disease, coeliac disease and primary biliary cholangitis. Systemic features may affect up to 70% and include inflammatory arthritis, skin involvement, haematological abnormalities, neuropathies, interstitial lung disease and a 5–10% lifetime risk of B cell lymphoma. Treatment should aim to empower patients to manage their condition; conserve, replace and stimulate secretions; prevent damage; and suppress underlying systemic disease activity.

### Efficacy and safety of topical and systemic medications: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of Sjögren's syndrome [^75941664]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate current evidence on the efficacy and safety of topical and systemic medications in patients with primary Sjögren syndrome (SjS) to inform European League Against Rheumatism treatment recommendations.

Methods

The MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched for case-control/prospective cohort studies, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews.

Results

Current evidence in primary SjS patients fulfilling the 2002 criteria is based on the data from 9 RCTs, 18 prospective cohort studies and 5 case-control studies. Two Cochrane systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have reported that topical treatments for dry mouth and dry eye are safe and effective. Ocular cyclosporine A was safe and effective in two RCTs including 1039 patients with dry eye syndrome. Two Cochrane SLRs on serum tear drops and plugs showed inconsistency in possible benefits, both for symptoms and objective measures. Five RCTs reported significant improvements in oral dryness and salivary flow rates for pilocarpine and cevimeline. An RCT showed no significant placebo-differences for hydroxychloroquine 400mg/day for the primary outcome (visual analogue scale (VAS) composite of dryness, fatigue and pain). We identified seven RCTs carried out in primary SjS patients. RCTs using infliximab, anakinra and baminercept found no placebo-differences for the primary outcomes. The two largest RCTs randomised 255 patients to receive rituximab or placebo and reported no significant results in the primary outcome (VAS composite), while prospective studies suggested efficacy in systemic disease.

Conclusion

The current evidence supporting the use of the main topical therapeutic options of primary SjS is solid, while limited data from RCTs are available to guide systemic therapies.

### British Society for Rheumatology guideline on management of adult and juvenile onset Sjögren disease [^7ea85dce]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and rationale for guideline development

The rationale behind this update of the 2017 British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) guideline for the management of Sjögren disease (SD) is described in the guideline scope. SD continues to be a chronic, autoimmune disease of unknown aetiology for which there is no known curative treatment. People with SD report ongoing frustration with the paucity of treatment and the lack of provision and knowledge in the healthcare system. Successful management requires personalization of care. Although dryness (sicca) of the eyes and mouth are the classically described features, dryness of other mucosal surfaces and systemic manifestations, including fatigue and arthralgia, are common. Systemic (extraglandular) features affect at least 70% and include inflammatory arthritis, skin involvement, haematological abnormalities, neuropathies, interstitial lung disease (ILD) and B-cell lymphoma (5–10% lifetime risk). The key management aim should be to empower the individual to manage their condition — conserving, replacing and stimulating secretions; and preventing damage and suppressing underlying systemic disease activity.

SD has a significant impact on the quality of life (QoL) of affected people. A recent literature review found that health-related QoL (HRQoL) was markedly reduced in SD in multiple studies across many countries when compared with healthy controls. The reduction in HRQoL was similar to that observed in other chronic diseases such as RA and SLE, suggesting that it is not a 'benign' disease. This reduction in QoL has been noted in multiple domains and across all populations studied worldwide. Anxiety, depression, pain and fatigue are all increased in SD compared with healthy controls and significantly impact on the QoL. The loss of taste and smell that accompanies SD has a negative effect on the QoL as does the ocular dryness. There is a significant reduction in sexual QOL due to the combined effects of vaginal dryness, atrophy and psychosocial factors such as coping strategies and illness perceptions. Systemic involvement, including nervous system manifestations such as peripheral neuropathy, respiratory system involvement and arthralgia, also have a negative impact on QoL.

### Management of extraglandular manifestations of primary Sjögren's syndrome [^84c25a5d]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Primary Sjögren's syndrome can have multiple extra-glandular manifestations ranging from mild to severe. Treatment for extra-glandular manifestations is organ specific and therapies are targeted based on the primary organs involved. Preferred treatment options used for extra-glandular manifestations of Sjögren's syndrome are usually extrapolated from the physician's experience in treating similar manifestations in other autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematous. The lack of immunomodulating disease modifying drugs in Sjögren's syndrome can be frustrating for patients dealing with extra-glandular manifestations, however recent advances in the field has made the future look promising for new therapeutic options.

Hydroxychloroquine

We identified 12 studies that assessed hydroxychloroquine in SjS patients, with only 4 (2 prospective and 2 RCTs) carried out in primary-2002 patients. Yavuz et al prospectively enrolled 32 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine for at least 2 years (no data on mean length or cumulative dose) and reported, in a further 12-week control study, a significant improvement in four out of eight ocular outcomes with respect to baseline, with no information on concomitant ocular therapies. Çankaya et al prospectively evaluated 30 women who started on 400 mg/day of hydroxychloroquine and reported a significant improvement in uSF rate (0.212 vs 0.162 baseline, p < 0.05) but not stimulated salivary flow rate at 30 weeks, with improvement in only two of the five subjective oral VAS scores. Yoon et al carried out a small RCT in 26 patients and found no significant differences in dry eye in comparison with PLA, but with no definition of the primary outcome. The pivotal RCT was carried out by Gottenberg et al in 120 patients with primary-2002 SjS who were randomised to receive 400 mg/day of hydroxychloroquine (n = 56) or PLA (n = 64): the primary outcome was defined as a ≥ 30% reduction in two out of three VAS scores — dryness, fatigue, pain — without significant PLA differences at week 24 (17.6% vs 17.3%, p = 0.96). For one of the secondary outcomes, hydroxychloroquine was associated with a statistical trend to improved pain (p values between 0.06 and 0.10 at 12, 24 and 48 weeks) although it was not superior to PLA for articular involvement; with respect to fatigue, no statistical differences were found. No cases of retinal toxicity or severe adverse events were reported in any of these studies.

### Efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions: a systematic review informing the 2023 EULAR recommendations for the management of fatigue in people with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases [^c1e4196e]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify the best evidence on the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions in reducing fatigue in people with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (I-RMDs) and to summarise their safety in the identified studies to inform European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology recommendations for the management of fatigue in people with I-RMDs.

Methods

Systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including adults with I-RMDs conducted according to the Cochrane Handbook. Search strategy ran in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL Complete, PEDro, OTseeker and PsycINFO. Assessment of risk of bias, data extraction and synthesis were performed by two reviewers independently. Data were pooled in meta-analyses.

Results

From a total of 4150 records, 454 were selected for full-text review, 82 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 55 RCTs were included in meta-analyses. Physical activity or exercise was efficacious in reducing fatigue in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (standardised mean differences (SMD) = -0.23, 95% CI = -0.37to -0.1), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (SMD = -0.54, 95% CI = -1.07to -0.01) and spondyloarthritis (SMD = -0.94, 95% CI = -1.23to -0.66); reduction of fatigue was not significant in Sjögren's syndrome (SMD = -0.83, 95% CI = -2.13to 0.47) and systemic sclerosis (SMD = -0.66, 95% CI = -1.33to 0.02). Psychoeducational interventions were efficacious in reducing fatigue in RA (SMD = -0.32, 95% CI = -0.48to -0.16), but not in SLE (SMD = -0.19, 95% CI = -0.46to 0.09). Follow-up models in consultations (SMD = -0.05, 95% CI = -0.29to 0.20) and multicomponent interventions (SMD = -0.20, 95% CI = -0.53to 0.14) did not show significant reductions of fatigue in RA. The results of RCTs not included in the meta-analysis suggest that several other non-pharmacological interventions may provide a reduction of fatigue, with reassuring safety results.

Conclusions

Physica activity or exercise and psychoeducational interventions are efficacious and safe for managing fatigue in people with I-RMDs.

3a. In people suspected of having SD, what is the diagnostic accuracy of major and minor salivary gland biopsy?

Six suitable studies were identified looking at the diagnostic accuracy of labial salivary gland biopsy. These reported a sensitivity of 80–92% and specificity of 88–97%.

One case series of 50 individuals described minor complications of labial salivary gland biopsy in up to 20% (6% transient sensory defect, 6% transient local pain, 2% transient localized burning, 6% cutaneous haematoma and 4% mild mucosal inflammation). In another larger retrospective study of 630 individuals across two centres, 20% reported long standing impairment of sensation post-biopsy although with a low level of impact on everyday life. A third study involving 186 individuals reported loss of sensation in only 3%. A systematic review comparing complication rates in those undergoing a minimally invasive technique compared with a linear incision technique found the pooled prevalence of permanent neurological adverse events was eight times lower in the minimally invasive group (0.17% vs 1.45%). A recently published study has confirmed the safety in a case series of 110 people undergoing biopsy. Only four experienced temporary lip numbness with no permanent complications.

Consensus guidelines on reporting of labial salivary gland biopsy have been developed by the EULAR Sjogren's Syndrome (EULAR SS) study group and recommend reporting the Focus Score (i.e. number of foci of > 50 mononuclear cells per 4 mm² of tissue).

One study directly compared parotid to labial salivary gland biopsy. All 110 underwent simultaneous parotid and labial salivary gland biopsies. At 1 week and 6 months post-procedure they reported more pain and numbness in the parotid biopsy site but by 12 months symptoms were minor and comparable at both sites. A recent single-centre study in 29 individuals has investigated US-guided core needle biopsy of parotid glands and reported adequate samples for diagnosis in 96.5% of cases.

There is evidence that if the serology and salivary gland USS results are compatible (e.g. both negative or both positive), then a biopsy is of little added value. There is increasing evidence that the diagnosis of SD can be confirmed or excluded without a biopsy, although the current classification criteria do not include USS.

This guideline builds on, and widens the recommendations developed for the first guideline published in 2017. We have included advice on the management of children and adolescents where appropriate to provide a comprehensive guideline for UK-based rheumatology teams.

### Development and testing of an alternative responder definition for EULAR Sjögren's syndrome patient reported index (ESSPRI) [^66b2e406]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Dryness, fatigue and joint/muscle pain are typically assessed in Sjögren's trials using European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology Sjögren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI). A Patient Acceptable Symptom State of < 5and a Minimal Clinically Important Improvement (MCII)/responder definition (RD) of ≥ 1 point or 15% on ESSPRI have previously been defined. This study explored alternative RDs to better discriminate between active treatment and placebo in trials.

Methods

Anchor-based and distribution-based methods were used to derive RD thresholds in blinded phase IIb trial data (N = 190) and confirm these in blinded data pooled from three early phase II trials (N = 126). The populations consisted of individuals with moderate-to-severe systemic primary Sjögren's. Anchors were prioritised by ESSPRI correlations and used in similar conditions. Triangulated estimates were discussed with experts (N = 3). The revised RD was compared with the original using unblinded data to assess placebo and treatment responder rates.

Results

Patients were predominantly female (> 90%), white (90%), with mean age of 50 years. Receiver operating characteristic estimates supported an MCII threshold of 1.5–1.6 in the phase II data, whereas correlation-weighted mean change estimates supported a low/minimal symptom severity threshold of ≥ 2. A low/minimal symptom severity of ≤ 3 showed the greatest sensitivity/specificity balance. Analyses in the pooled data supported these thresholds (MCII: 1.5–2.1; low/minimal symptom severity: 2.7–3.7). Unblinded analyses confirmed the revised RD reduced placebo rates.

Conclusions

Completing a trial with an improvement of ≥ 1.5 points compared with baseline and an ESSPRI score of ≤ 3 points is a relevant RD for moderate-to-severe systemic Sjögren's and reduces placebo rates.

### Burden of illness among subgroups of patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome and systemic involvement [^59ded371]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To describe how patients with primary SS (pSS) and systemic organ involvement are classified and clustered in routine practice.

Methods

This multinational, cross-sectional survey of real-world quantitative data was conducted across Europe and the US. Rheumatologists who treated seven or more adult patients per month with pSS and current/past systemic manifestations undertook a survey before completing a patient record form capturing demographic, clinical and treatment information for their next six eligible patients. Patients with a completed patient record form were invited to complete a patient self-completion questionnaire capturing insights into their disease and treatment. Subgroups were defined by physicians' assessment of disease severity; clusters were derived based on key clinical characteristics using latent class analysis.

Results

Rheumatologists completed 316 physician surveys and 1879 patient record forms; 888 patients completed the patient self-completion questionnaire. pSS severity reflected organ involvement and symptomatology. Latent class analysis produced five clusters distinguished by the organ systems involved and the presence of pain and fatigue symptoms at the time of the survey. A minority of patients [n = 67 (4%)] were categorized with multiple organ involvement and the highest frequency of pain and fatigue. A total of 324 patients (17%) were categorized as 'low burden'. The remaining three clusters exhibited high frequencies of articular involvement but were distinguished by the extent of other organ system involvement.

Conclusion

Cluster analysis using a real-world cohort of patients with pSS and systemic organ involvement highlights the heterogeneous presentation of patients with pSS and confirms the importance of pain and fatigue as well as organ involvement when determining disease burden.

### British Society for Rheumatology guideline on management of adult and juvenile onset Sjögren disease [^8a187b1b]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

MTX is considered the drug of choice for people with RA and significant inflammatory arthritis associated with SD. An open-label, pilot study of weekly MTX in 17 individuals with SD showed improvement in sicca symptoms, parotid swelling, dry cough and purpura, but no improvement in objective parameters of dry eyes and mouth. Despite the lack of clear evidence of efficacy and paucity of trial data, the European and North American guidelines all recommend the use of MTX in SD-associated joint disease.

A single-centre, open-label trial of mycophenolate in just 11 individuals reported a significant reduction in hypergammaglobulinemia and an increase in complement levels, but little effect on glandular features. Case reports support the use of mycophenolate in SD-associated agranulocytosis and ILD. It is not recommended in the Japanese or the North American guidelines but Saraux et al. suggest considering it for lung disease, and there is evidence for a role in the management of CTD-associated ILD.

There was some benefit in a LEF alone study in SD involving only 15 individuals of whom most developed significant side effects. A more recent RCT of 29 individuals on LEF/HCQ combination therapy did show some clinical benefit with a significant decrease in ESSDAI score and little in the way of side effects, and is supported by immunological evidence of benefit. Further studies of combination therapy are planned.

There are anecdotal reports of successful treatment of SD-associated interstitial cystitis, annular erythema, red cell aplasia and pneumonitis with oral ciclosporin. An open-label phase II study of low dose ciclosporin A (2 mg/kg) showed reductions in joint swelling and tenderness. The Japanese guidelines do not recommend it and the North American guidelines found scant evidence for its use.

There are no controlled trials of CYC in SD and in general its potential toxicity would preclude routine use. However there are published case reports and series documenting successful treatment of SD-associated myelopathy, refractory thrombocytopaenia, glomerulonephritis and lung disease. In practice, its use is reserved for those with progressive organ-threatening disease and in many of these clinical situations, rituximab would now be the treatment of choice across North America and Europe. The Japanese guidelines suggests its use in those with lung, kidney or CNS involvement.

Most of the conventional immunosuppressive drugs can be used off-label in children from the age of 2 years, with the exception of LEF which is not approved for use in people younger than 18 years.

### Executive summary: British Society for Rheumatology guideline on management of adult and juvenile onset Sjögren disease [^d7aaeafd]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Key questions identified in the scope

1. In people suspected of SD, what is the diagnostic accuracy of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) and other novel antigen testing?

Studies (see Table 1) estimate the sensitivity of ANA as 58–85% and specificity as 50–97%. ANA is commonly used as a screening antibody but because of its frequency and low specificity, should not be measured in the absence of clinical indicators.

Table 1.
Summary of evidence on diagnostic accuracy of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in SD and various CTDs

Studies (see Table 2) estimate the sensitivity of ENA as 89–92%; with a specificity of 71–77%. In a very small number of cases individuals can be ANA negative but Ro positive.

Table 2.
Summary of evidence on diagnostic accuracy of extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) in SD

None of the 'novel' autoantibodies out-perform anti-Ro antibody and are not recommended outside a research setting.

Recommendation

Do not measure ANA in the absence of clinical indicators of SD or other CTD (1, C) SOA 94.6%.

Use ANA as a screening antibody where there is a clinical suspicion of CTD (1, C) SOA 93.9%.

Measure ENA even if the ANA is negative if there is a high index of suspicion of SD (1, C) SOA 96.7%.

2a. In people suspected of SD, what is the diagnostic accuracy of salivary gland (SG) ultrasound scanning (USS)?

Multiple studies have confirmed the utility of SG USS in the diagnosis of SD in both adults and children, although it may not differentiate between SS and sarcoid or other connective tissue diseases (CTDs) and does not form part of the classification criteria.

Recommendation

USS of the salivary glands can provide useful additional information to support either the presence of or lack of evidence for SD (1, A) SOA 95.2%.

USS does not currently replace either antibody testing or histological analysis in adult SD classification criteria (1, A) SOA 96.4%.

2b. In people suspected of SD, what is the diagnostic accuracy of other imaging modalities?

Reviews of imaging modalities in SD have concluded that further studies are needed to establish the role of PET, CT and MRI. None of the imaging modalities are included in the most recent classification criteria.

### Consensus guidelines for evaluation and management of pulmonary disease in Sjögren's [^30beb7fe]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary disease is a potentially serious yet underdiagnosed complication of Sjögren's syndrome, the second most common autoimmune rheumatic disease. Approximately 16% of patients with Sjögren's demonstrate pulmonary involvement with higher mortality and lower quality of life.

Research Question

Clinical practice guidelines for pulmonary manifestations of Sjögren's were developed by the Sjögren's Foundation after identifying a critical need for early diagnosis and improved quality and consistency of care.

Study Design and Methods

A rigorous and transparent methodology was followed according to American College of Rheumatology guidelines. The Pulmonary Topic Review Group (TRG) developed clinical questions in the PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) format and selected literature search parameters. Each article was reviewed by a minimum of two TRG members for eligibility and assessment of quality of evidence and strength of recommendation. Guidelines were then drafted based on available evidence, expert opinion, and clinical importance. Draft recommendations with a clinical rationale and data extraction tables were submitted to a Consensus Expert Panel for consideration and approval, with at least 75% agreement required for individual recommendations to be included in the final version.

Results

The literature search revealed 1,192 articles, of which 150 qualified for consideration in guideline development. Of the original 85 PICO questions posed by the TRG, 52 recommendations were generated. These were then reviewed by the Consensus Expert Panel and 52 recommendations were finalized, with a mean agreement of 97.71% (range, 79%-100%). The recommendations span topics of evaluating Sjögren's patients for pulmonary manifestations and assessing, managing, and treating upper and lower airway disease, interstitial lung disease, and lymphoproliferative disease.

Interpretation

Clinical practice guidelines for pulmonary manifestations in Sjögren's will improve early identification, evaluation, and uniformity of care by primary care physicians, rheumatologists, and pulmonologists. Additionally, opportunities for future research are identified.

### New developments in Sjögren's syndrome [^7c02ab27]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

B-cell activating factor (BAFF)

Alternative strategies for targeting B-cells have been suggested including BAFF, a member of the TNF ligand family, which promotes B-cell survival, maturation and germinal centre maintenance.

Belimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody which targets BAFF. The Phase II study, BELISS, which enrolled 30 patients provided promising outcome data. At 28 weeks, 60% of patients had achieved the primary end point of an improvement in two of five areas: a 30% decrease in dryness, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, physician assessed systemic activity VAS or > 25% improvement in any B-cell activation markers. It was notable that the proportion of patients seeing improvements in fatigue and musculoskeletal pain was relatively lower than the other domains. Targeting BAFF in isolation may not improve the features of SS that patients commonly report in clinic: fatigue and musculoskeletal pain.

In responders, long-term treatment with belimumab may be beneficial as continuation of treatment was shown to provide a stable, sustained clinical response and a continued decrease in B-cell activation markers at 52 weeks. Improvements in parotid swelling, lymphadenopathy and the articular domain were noted, but there were no significant changes in lacrimal or salivary function. A review, 12 months after the trial had ended, found that, in this group of 13 patients, the ESSDAI had increased from 3.5 at the end of treatment to 7.0. Over the same time period, levels of BAFF, RF and IgM were also shown to increase significantly; providing further support for the efficacy of belimumab.

Recommendation

Overall, although they may provide useful supplementary information, we do not recommend additional imaging modalities over and above USS in the routine assessment of SD (1, C) SOA 97.3%

3a. In people suspected of SD, what is the diagnostic accuracy of major and minor salivary gland biopsy?

Minor (labial) SG biopsy — sensitivity 80–92%; specificity 88–97% — forms an essential part of the 2016 ACR/EULAR classification criteria when individuals are anti-Ro antibody negative. Parotid gland biopsy has a sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 86%. Complication rates of both are low overall, especially in those undergoing minimally invasive techniques.

Recommendation

Consider a minor labial salivary gland biopsy to aid diagnosis in those with clinically suspected SD where the diagnosis cannot be made by clinical and serological features alone (1, A) SOA 98.2%

3b. In people suspected of SD, what is the diagnostic accuracy of lacrimal gland biopsy?

Recommendation

There is currently insufficient evidence to routinely recommend lacrimal gland biopsy in SD (1, C) SOA 98.2%

4a. In people with confirmed SD are there any measurable biomarkers that can predict development of lymphoma?

Certain factors consistently emerge as predictors of future lymphoma development in SD in adults and children:

low C3/C4 with low C4 being the strongest predictor;
clinical evidence of salivary gland enlargement;
clinical evidence of lymphadenopathy;
anti-Ro and/or La and RF;
cryoglobulinaemia;
conoclonal gammopathy; and
high focus score.

Recommendation

Individuals with SD should be offered further investigation early if they present with new salivary gland swelling or other symptoms that might suggest the development of lymphoma (1, A) SOA 98.75%.

Consider a minor labial salivary gland biopsy to provide additional prognostic data regarding lymphoma risk in both seronegative and seropositive individuals (2, C) SOA 92.7%.

4b. In people with confirmed SD, are there any measurable biomarkers that can predict disease progression or development of extra-glandular disease?

A number of features are associated with a higher risk of progression to systemic extra-glandular disease:

anti-Ro antibody positive;
younger age of onset;
ethnicity (Black/African-American);
males; and
RF positive.

Recommendation

Baseline assessment of individuals with SD should include a thorough clinical and serological evaluation to inform the risk of development of extra-glandular features and disease progression (1, B) SOA 97.6%

Rituximab

Rituximab has been tested in three prospective cohort studies, one case-control studyand four RCTs. A summary of the significant improvements reported with respect to baseline in the prospective cohort studies showed improvement in VAS for dryness, fatigueand pain/tender point count, while no significant improvements were reported for objective oral and ocular tests (except in the study by Pijpe et al in a subset of patients). In the case-control study, Carubbi et al compared the therapeutic effect of rituximab (n = 22) and conventional immunosuppressive therapy (n = 19) and found a significant improvement in patients treated with rituximab in the ESSDAI (< 0.05), global VAS (< 0.05), fatigue VAS (< 0.01), dryness VAS (< 0.01), physician VAS (< 0.05), uSF (< 0.01) and Schirmer test (< 0.05) at the end of follow-up (120 weeks); the authors reported a complete lack of reported adverse events in either of the two arms in spite of the long-term nature of the study. With respect to the two small RCTs, Dass et al randomised 17 primary-2002 patients to receive rituximab (n = 8) or PLA (n = 9) and found no significant results in the primary outcome (improvement > 20% VAS fatigue at 6 months, rituximab 87% vs PLA 56%, p = 0.36), while Meijer et al randomised 30 primary-2002 patients to receive rituximab (n = 20) or PLA (n = 10) with no significant results for the primary outcome (improvement in SWSF rate at 48 weeks, p > 0.05). Two large RCTs have recently been reported. In 2014, Devauchelle-Pensec et al randomised 122 primary-2002 patients to receive rituximab (n = 63) or PLA (n = 57) and found no significant results in the primary outcome (≥ 30 mm improvement at week 24 on at least 2 out of 4 VAS scores — dryness, fatigue, pain, global, 23% vs 22%, p = 0.91), while Bowman et al randomised 133 primary-2002 patients to receive rituximab (n = 67) or PLA (n = 66) and found no significant results in the primary outcome (reduction ≥ 30% at week 48 in either fatigue or oral dryness VAS, rituximab 39.3% vs PLA 36.8%, p = 0.76). Two recent meta-analyses including the four RCTs have confirmed the lack of significant between-group differences in mean improvements between baseline and week 24 values for fatigue VAS, oral dryness VAS, salivary flow rate and Schirmer test, and no significant difference between groups for the main adverse events.

### Effects of hydroxychloroquine on symptomatic improvement in primary Sjögren syndrome: the JOQUER randomized clinical trial [^b704b27d]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Primary Sjögren syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by mouth and eye dryness, pain, and fatigue. Hydroxychloroquine is the most frequently prescribed immunosuppressant for the syndrome. However, evidence regarding its efficacy is limited.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for the main symptoms of primary Sjögren syndrome: dryness, pain, and fatigue.

Design, Setting, and Participants

From April 2008 to May 2011, 120 patients with primary Sjögren syndrome according to American-European Consensus Group Criteria from 15 university hospitals in France were randomized in a double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial. Participants were assessed at baseline, week 12, week 24 (primary outcome), and week 48. The last follow-up date for the last patient was May 15, 2012.

Interventions

Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive hydroxychloroquine (400 mg/d) or placebo until week 24. All patients were prescribed hydroxychloroquine between weeks 24 and 48.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the proportion of patients with a 30% or greater reduction between weeks 0 and 24 in scores on 2 of 3 numeric analog scales (from 0 [best] to 10 [worst]) evaluating dryness, pain, and fatigue.

Results

At 24 weeks, the proportion of patients meeting the primary end point was 17.9% (10/56) in the hydroxychloroquine group and 17.2% (11/64) in the placebo group (odds ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.37–2.78; P = 0.98). Between weeks 0 and 24, the mean (SD) numeric analog scale score for dryness changed from 6.38 (2.14) to 5.85 (2.57) in the placebo group and 6.53 (1.97) to 6.22 (1.87) in the hydroxychloroquine group. The mean (SD) numeric analog scale score for pain changed from 4.92 (2.94) to 5.08 (2.48) in the placebo group and 5.09 (3.06) to 4.59 (2.90) in the hydroxychloroquine group. The mean (SD) numeric analog scale for fatigue changed from 6.26 (2.27) to 5.72 (2.38) in the placebo group and 6.00 (2.52) to 5.94 (2.40) in the hydroxychloroquine group. All but 1 patient in the hydroxychloroquine group had detectable blood levels of the drug. Hydroxychloroquine had no efficacy in patients with anti-SSA autoantibodies, high IgG levels, or systemic involvement. During the first 24 weeks, there were 2 serious adverse events in the hydroxychloroquine group and 3 in the placebo group; in the last 24 weeks, there were 3 serious adverse events in the hydroxychloroquine group and 4 in the placebo group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with primary Sjögren syndrome, the use of hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo did not improve symptoms during 24 weeks of treatment. Further studies are needed to evaluate longer-term outcomes.

### The neurology of Sjögren's syndrome and the rheumatology of peripheral neuropathy and myelitis [^32a75bc5]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Neurological symptoms occur in approximately 20% of patients with Sjögren's syndrome, and may be the presenting manifestations of the disease. Here, we review several neurological conditions that can occur in Sjögren's syndrome: sensory ganglionopathy, painful small fibre neuropathy, and transverse myelitis (independently or as part of neuromyelitis optica). We present the symptoms, signs, differential diagnoses, recommended diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of each of these, highlighting the features that should alert neurologists to consider Sjögren's syndrome.
