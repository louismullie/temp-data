## Question

A 20-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of severe muscle soreness, nausea, and darkened urine for 2 days. The patient is on the college track team and has been training intensively for an upcoming event. One month ago, she had a urinary tract infection and was treated with nitrofurantoin. She appears healthy. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 64/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and non-tender. There is diffuse muscle tenderness over the arms, legs, and back. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 12.8 g/dL
Leukocyte count 7,000/mm3
Platelet count 265,000/mm3
Serum
Creatine kinase 22,000 U/L
Lactate dehydrogenase 380 U/L
Urine
Blood 3+
Protein 1+
RBC negative
WBC 1–2/hpf
This patient is at increased risk for which of the following complications?

Answer Choices:
A. Acute kidney injury
B. Compartment syndrome
C. Metabolic alkalosis
D. Myocarditis

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which complication a 20-year-old woman with severe muscle soreness, dark urine, and markedly elevated creatine kinase is most at risk for, given her recent intense training and prior nitrofurantoin exposure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis and whether this fits rhabdomyolysis. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology linking rhabdomyolysis to potential complications. Next, I will evaluate each answer choice against the clinical and laboratory data, making sure I don't jump to conclusions. Finally, I will confirm the single best answer and briefly outline immediate management priorities.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis. Severe myalgias with dark urine and a creatine kinase around 22,000 U/L strongly suggest rhabdomyolysis from exertional muscle breakdown, and the urine "blood" on dipstick with absent RBCs indicates myoglobinuria rather than hematuria, which is classic for rhabdomyolysis. I should double-check that this pattern is consistent with exertional rhabdomyolysis in athletes, which it is, and that the timing fits a recent intense training period, which it does.

> Now, I need to think about complications. Rhabdomyolysis causes myoglobin release, which can precipitate in the renal tubules and cause acute kidney injury, particularly when volume status is suboptimal or there are co-factors. Wait, let me verify whether prior nitrofurantoin meaningfully increases AKI risk here; I initially thought nitrofurantoin could be nephrotoxic, but hold on, I should verify — nitrofurantoin is not a direct nephrotoxin and is more associated with pulmonary toxicity, so the AKI risk here is primarily from myoglobinuria rather than the antibiotic itself, though dehydration and any renal vulnerability could amplify injury.

> Next, I should review the other options. Compartment syndrome is a concern with crush injuries or tight compartments, but I need to check for clinical signs like severe pain out of proportion, tenseness, paresthesias, or pallor; none are reported here, and diffuse muscle tenderness without focal compartment findings makes compartment syndrome unlikely in this scenario, so I should not overcall it. Metabolic alkalosis would be atypical in rhabdomyolysis; instead, I should expect metabolic acidosis from released organic acids and lactate, so alkalosis is not the expected complication here. Myocarditis can present with chest pain, dyspnea, or arrhythmias and is diagnosed with troponin, ECG, and often CMR; there is no troponin elevation, ECG abnormality, or heart failure phenotype described, so myocarditis is not the leading risk in this presentation.

> I will now examine why acute kidney injury is the most likely and clinically significant risk. Myoglobinuria can cause direct tubular toxicity and tubular obstruction, and AKI is a well-established complication of rhabdomyolysis. I should confirm that early aggressive IV hydration is the cornerstone to mitigate AKI risk, which it is, and that monitoring urine output and renal function is essential in the first 24–72 hours, which aligns with standard management of exertional rhabdomyolysis.

> But wait, what if the dark urine reflects something else, like hematuria or bilirubin? I should double-check the urinalysis details: the dipstick shows blood with no RBCs, which supports myoglobin rather than red cells, reinforcing rhabdomyolysis and the consequent AKI risk rather than a glomerular process or biliary issue, so I can be confident in this pathophysiology and the primacy of AKI as the complication to anticipate.

> Final answer: A. Acute kidney injury. The patient's exertional rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria places her at highest risk for AKI, whereas compartment syndrome is not supported by the exam, metabolic alkalosis is not expected, and there is no evidence of myocarditis on the data provided.

---

The patient has **exertional rhabdomyolysis** with markedly elevated CK and myoglobinuria, placing her at highest risk for **acute kidney injury (AKI)** due to renal tubular obstruction and toxicity from myoglobin. AKI is the most common and serious complication in this setting, especially with dehydration or NSAID use, and requires prompt IV hydration and close monitoring of renal function. Compartment syndrome is less likely without focal pain or neurovascular compromise, metabolic alkalosis is not expected, and myocarditis is not supported by the absence of cardiac symptoms or troponin elevation.

---

## Pathophysiology of rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury

Rhabdomyolysis causes **muscle breakdown** with release of intracellular contents, including myoglobin, CK, and lactate dehydrogenase. Myoglobin is filtered by the glomerulus and can precipitate in the renal tubules, causing obstruction and direct tubular epithelial injury, leading to AKI [^notfound]. Risk factors for AKI in rhabdomyolysis include:

- **High CK levels**: CK > 5,000 U/L significantly increases AKI risk.
- **Myoglobinuria**: Dark urine indicates significant myoglobin release.
- **Dehydration**: Intense exercise without adequate hydration increases risk.
- **NSAID use**: Can exacerbate renal injury by reducing renal perfusion.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting AKI risk

The patient's CK of 22,000 U/L and myoglobinuria are strong predictors of **AKI** [^notfound]. Studies show that CK levels above 5,000 U/L are associated with a markedly increased risk of AKI, and myoglobinuria is a direct indicator of renal tubular injury [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other complications

| **Complication** | **Likelihood in this patient** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute kidney injury (AKI) | High | - Markedly elevated CK <br/> - Myoglobinuria <br/> - Dehydration from intense exercise [^notfound] |
| Compartment syndrome | Low | - No focal severe pain <br/> - No neurovascular compromise <br/> - Diffuse muscle tenderness is more consistent with rhabdomyolysis [^notfound] |
| Metabolic alkalosis | Low | - Rhabdomyolysis typically causes metabolic acidosis, not alkalosis [^notfound] |
| Myocarditis | Low | - No cardiac symptoms <br/> - No troponin elevation <br/> - No ECG changes [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical management and prevention of AKI

Immediate management focuses on **preventing AKI** through aggressive IV hydration to maintain urine output and flush myoglobin from the renal tubules, with close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes, and acid-base status. Avoidance of nephrotoxic agents, particularly NSAIDs, is essential [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The patient is at **highest risk for acute kidney injury (AKI)** due to exertional rhabdomyolysis with markedly elevated CK and myoglobinuria. Prompt recognition and aggressive hydration are critical to prevent renal injury [^notfound].

Proposed stages of myocarditis — The spectrum of myocarditis is described as 4 stages: A (at-risk); B (asymptomatic); C (symptomatic myocarditis); and D (advanced myocarditis). Stage A comprises patients at risk for myocarditis but without symptoms or diagnosis of myocarditis and without structural, biomarker, imaging or histopathological markers of myocarditis, with risk factors including cardiotoxic agents including immune checkpoint inhibitors, viral infections, autoimmune disorders, thymoma, vaccines, genetic predisposition, personal history of myocarditis, and hypereosinophilia. Stage B includes patients with risk factors for myocarditis but without classic symptoms of acute myocarditis but with histopathology consistent with myocarditis OR cardiac MRI findings consistent with myocarditis OR elevated hs-cardiac troponin levels with additional supportive evidence. Stage C involves patients with classic symptoms of acute myocarditis with histopathology consistent with myocarditis or CMR consistent with myocarditis per the Updated Lake Louise Criteria (2018) or elevated hs-cardiac troponin levels with additional supportive evidence. Stage D fulfills criteria for stage C myocarditis with hemodynamic instability requiring inopressor or temporary circulatory support OR electrical instability requiring intervention.

Stage C myocarditis — diagnostic requirements and clinical course are outlined as follows: Stage C refers to persons with symptomatic myocarditis. For the proposed 4-stage classification, the diagnosis requires clinical symptoms typical of myocarditis, absence of features that define stage D (advanced) myocarditis, and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) findings based on both abnormal T1 and T2 parameters; alternatively, an elevated high-sensitivity troponin (Tn) with supportive evidence or an endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) consistent with myocarditis can establish stage C. Patients with an initial presentation of a cardiomyopathy may have an elevated Tn, and in this context either CMR or histopathological evidence is needed to confirm myocarditis. Most patients recover from the acute illness but remain stage A at-risk for recurrent myocarditis; occasionally, persistent inflammation on CMR or cardiac 18F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET) and/or elevated Tn prompts reclassification to stage B, and increased glucose metabolism on PET or prolonged T1 and T2 relaxation times on CMR may reflect a healing phase.

CONCLUSIONS

Myocarditis is a heterogeneous disease in terms of disease severity and manifestation. As many patients with suspected myocarditis will present in different subspecialties of cardiology, well organized myocarditis care pathways spanning beyond the boundaries of subspecialty cardiology disciplines are advisable. Using a 3‐tier diagnostic approach allows for the structured evaluation of the patients with suspected myocarditis allowing to titrate the diagnostic and therapeutic process to the patients' individualized needs. Such a structured tier approach can easily be supplemented by emerging advances in the future, such as immune phenotyping that could potentially shape the diagnosis, classification, and therapeutic basis of myocarditis.

Diagnosis of myocarditis — clinical symptoms: The initial step for a clinician in the assessment of a patient with possible myocarditis is to recognize that a clinical scenario is consistent with this diagnosis, and clinicians should be aware of 3 classic presentations — chest pain, arrhythmia, or heart failure (HF)/cardiogenic shock. The history of an antecedent viral infection in a young person, a prior diagnosis of myocarditis or autoimmune disease, a family history of cardiomyopathy or unexplained sudden death, or exposure to known cardiotoxin followed by related symptoms should raise the suspicion for this condition.

### Is it time for trials on preventing immune-mediated myocardial damage? [^114qWhTp]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2021). Medium credibility.

Myocarditis — a primary inflammatory injury of the myocardium — has been recognized as a distinct pathologic entity since the 19th century. Unfortunately, a comprehensive understanding of myocarditis that encapsulates why it happens, how it happens, and how to make it better remains stubbornly elusive. The enigmatic nature of myocarditis arises largely from its heterogeneity, with myocardial damage arising from diverse etiologies, presenting as an array of clinical manifestations, and resulting in a variety of long-term outcomes. Compounding these issues of heterogeneity are a lack of reliable and standardized diagnostic frameworks, creating a combination of "difficult-to-define" and "difficult-to-diagnose", which has made myocarditis difficult to effectively treat in multiple clinical trials. The lack of clear efficacy in clinical investigations has appropriately led investigators from the clinic back to the bench in efforts aimed at parsing the various, distinct aspects of immune-mediated myocardial damage that might be suitable for targeted therapy. Although myocarditis remains a relatively uncommon disease, the public health impact of the disease should not be overlooked nor the need for continued mechanistic research undersold. Myocarditis is a significant cause of sudden death in the young, and when presenting as a reduction in left ventricular function, has a significant risk of progressing to permanent cardiomyopathy with chronic heart failure.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) for diagnosing myocarditis — There are 2 pivotal tests to diagnose stages B–D myocarditis: EMB and CMR. EMB, including histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and molecular search for infectious agents, is the gold-standard diagnostic test for myocarditis, allowing characterization of histotype and specific etiologies (including viral). CMR is an attractive noninvasive strategy though it too has limitations, including reduced sensitivity depending upon clinical presentation, a delayed timing after onset of symptoms, and technical challenges due to patient breath-holding and irregular heart rhythms. The specificity of CMR diagnosis of myocarditis is enhanced when both T1 and T2 criteria are met, with figure-listed criteria of one T1-based criterion — increased T1 by T1 mapping, nonischemic late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), increased extracellular volume (ECV) — plus one T2-based criterion — increased T2 on T2 mapping and increased T2 on T2-weighted imaging. In the appropriate clinical context (eg, therapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor), an acute rise in troponin can be consistent with the diagnosis of myocarditis but the specificity of an elevated troponin with most other stage A risk factors is not adequate to make the diagnosis and one of the two pivotal tests would be needed, and myocardial infarction needs to be excluded (eg, by coronary angiography or absence of ischemic LGE on CMR). Abbreviations on-page: CMR = cardiac magnetic resonance; EMB = endomyocardial biopsy; LGE = late gadolinium enhancement; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; hs = high sensitivity.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: myocarditis [^1155auJQ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Myocarditis is a serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of myocarditis, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

Myocarditis is an inflammatory syndrome of myocardium, most often resulting from a viral infection, that can cause life-threatening cardiovascular collapse. It has a highly variable presentation and no widely available specific diagnostic test, making it a challenging diagnosis. Emergency clinicians should obtain an electrocardiogram and perform bedside ultrasound to assess cardiac function. Treatment in the ED is largely supportive, focusing on resuscitation, cardiovascular support, cardiology specialist consultation, and appropriate disposition.

Conclusions

An understanding of myocarditis can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this potentially deadly disease.

### Abstract… [^1144uTY6]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Some patients experience the disruption of some of these defense mechanisms. The conditions that increase the incidence of disruptions are listed in. Treatment. Many episodes of bacterial cystitis resolve without treatment. The consumption of cranberry juice decreases the ability of the bacteria to attach to uroepithelial cells. 8 Antibiotics hasten the resolution of symptoms and prevent the infection from spreading into the upper urinary tract. Adult nongravida women with uncomplicated cystitis may be treated empirically with a three-day course of antibiotics based on their clinical presentation and evidence of pyuria. Urine culture is not necessary in these women but should be performed if there is no pyuria despite a clinical picture of cystitis. Many antibiotics are effective in the treatment of cystitis, and most achieve high concentrations in the urine. Selection of the antibiotic should be determined by side effect profiles, drug interactions, cost and teratogenic effects.

Drugs and dosages for antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated cystitis in women are listed in. Complicated Urinary Tract Infections. Complicated urinary tract infections are defined as those occurring in patients with anatomically or functionally abnormal urinary tracts, or in patients who are immunocompromised or have iatrogenic infections. Clinical recognition of complicated urinary tract infections is important because these patients are more likely to harbor resistant organisms. Therapy consists of broader spectrum agents such as fluroquinolones. Cystitis should be treated for one week. Upper urinary tract infections should be treated for two weeks. A urine culture should be obtained to confirm sensitivity. 11 Estimates based on bladder washout studies show that 30 percent of women presenting with symptoms of cystitis actually have subclinical pyelonephritis.

12 This finding has important therapeutic sequelae: infections are more difficult to eradicate and require a two-week course of antibiotic therapy compared with the usual three-day course for cystitis, 13, 14 and since the renal parenchyma is involved, organism identification and confirmation of sensitivity are important. A urine culture and sensitivity should be obtained when an upper urinary tract infection is suspected based on clinical symptoms or risk factors. Diagnostic Evaluation Interstitial cystitis remains a diagnosis of exclusion. Patients present with dysuria, urgency and frequency. The majority of patients have dyspareunia, and about 20 percent of patients have gross hematuria. Characteristic symptoms of interstitial cystitis are listed in.

Myocarditis — diagnosis and classification emphasize that myocarditis requires histological or immunohistological confirmation by endomyocardial biopsy (EMB), surgical heart specimens, or an autopsy, yet it is often suspected clinically but infrequently confirmed by biopsy and in many cases rests on compatible clinical scenarios with noninvasive biomarker and imaging features rather than a pathological diagnosis; when myocarditis is suspected and EMB is infeasible or not clearly indicated, noninvasive diagnostic criteria can be used to diagnose suspected or probable acute myocarditis, with a recent definition including heart failure (HF) of < 3 months' duration associated with otherwise unexplained elevation in troponin or electrocardiographic features of cardiac injury, and new wall motion abnormalities, a pericardial effusion on echocardiography, or characteristic tissue features on MRI strengthen the diagnosis.

Myocarditis — histopathology (Dallas criteria) — the Dallas criteria, proposed in 1986, required the presence of inflammatory cells and myocyte necrosis/damage in the absence of ischemic characteristics; the first EMB was assessed as showing (active) myocarditis, borderline myocarditis, or absent myocarditis, and serial biopsies enabled diagnoses of persistent (ongoing), healing (resolving), or healed (resolved) myocarditis; "Borderline" myocarditis was diagnosed when inflammatory infiltrates were present but there was no myocyte necrosis.

Top 10 key takeaway points — cardiac imaging and biopsy: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) are considered pivotal tests in the diagnosis of myocarditis, with the former often allowing the noninvasive diagnosis of stage B or symptomatic myocarditis. When CMR is performed, the diagnosis of myocarditis is based on detection of abnormalities in both T1 and T2 imaging; however, in patients with certain presentations — typically those with reduced ventricular function, deranged hemodynamics/symptomatic HF, or electrical instability — an EMB is warranted to diagnose specific conditions that require etiology-directed therapies, including immunosuppressive agents.

### Management of acute myocarditis and chronic inflammatory cardiomyopathy: an expert consensus document [^112ZiMVT]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the heart that may occur because of infections, immune system activation, or exposure to drugs. The diagnosis of myocarditis has changed due to the introduction of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. We present an expert consensus document aimed to summarize the common terminology related to myocarditis meanwhile highlighting some areas of controversies and uncertainties and the unmet clinical needs. In fact, controversies persist regarding mechanisms that determine the transition from the initial trigger to myocardial inflammation and from acute myocardial damage to chronic ventricular dysfunction. It is still uncertain which viruses (besides enteroviruses) cause direct tissue damage, act as triggers for immune-mediated damage, or both. Regarding terminology, myocarditis can be characterized according to etiology, phase, and severity of the disease, predominant symptoms, and pathological findings. Clinically, acute myocarditis (AM) implies a short time elapsed from the onset of symptoms and diagnosis (generally < 1 month). In contrast, chronic inflammatory cardiomyopathy indicates myocardial inflammation with established dilated cardiomyopathy or hypokinetic nondilated phenotype, which in the advanced stages evolves into fibrosis without detectable inflammation. Suggested diagnostic and treatment recommendations for AM and chronic inflammatory cardiomyopathy are mainly based on expert opinion given the lack of well-designed contemporary clinical studies in the field. We will provide a shared and practical approach to patient diagnosis and management, underlying differences between the European and US scientific statements on this topic. We explain the role of histology that defines subtypes of myocarditis and its prognostic and therapeutic implications.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease of 2019) pandemic, myocarditis has received much attention and controversy as one of the more worrisome cardiovascular complications. After the availability of highly effective COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in late 2020, myocarditis was also appreciated as an important vaccine-related adverse event. Though the overall frequency of clinically evident viral myocarditis is rare in the general population, young males show a higher predilection for COVID vaccine-induced myocarditis. The severity of COVID-19 viral myocarditis is variable, ranging from very mild to severe, while vaccine-induced myocarditis is usually mild, and rarely a severe or fatal disease. The diagnosis of either COVID-19 or vaccine-induced myocarditis is based on typical clinical features, laboratory investigations, and imaging, preferably with cardiac magnetic resonance. The management of COVID-19 myocarditis is supportive care for mild or moderate disease. For the rare patient who develops severe disease, advanced heart failure therapies such as mechanical circulatory support devices may have to be employed and can be lifesaving. Avoidance of strenuous exercise during the bout of myocarditis and its recovery phase is important. Despite the small but finite risk of vaccine-induced myocarditis, the benefits of protection against COVID-19 disease and its attendant complications far outweigh the risks.

### Viral myocarditis – diagnosis, treatment options, and current controversies [^1146XqzK]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Myocarditis — a frequent cause of dilated cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death — typically results from cardiotropic viral infection followed by active inflammatory destruction of the myocardium. Characterization of this disease has been hampered by its heterogeneous clinical presentations and diverse aetiologies. Advances in cardiac MRI and molecular detection of viruses by endomyocardial biopsy have improved our ability to diagnose and understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of this elusive disease. However, therapeutic options are currently limited for both the acute and chronic phases of myocarditis. Several randomized, controlled trials have demonstrated potential benefit with immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies, but further investigations are warranted. In this Review, we explore the pathophysiology, natural history, and modes of diagnosis of myocarditis, as well as evidence-based treatment strategies. As novel imaging techniques and human in vitro models of the disease emerge, the landscape of therapies for myocarditis is poised to improve.

Myocarditis is an acute inflammatory syndrome involving the heart and related structures. In many instances, the presentation is obvious, and appropriate treatment and disposition follow accordingly. In other situations, patients present with viral illness of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts (or both) or nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and weakness, leading the clinician astray. Management is largely supportive, including aggressive cardiorespiratory support.

Myocarditis — additional recommendations state that cardiovascular magnetic resonance (MR) is reasonable for the diagnosis of myocarditis in clinically stable patients with clinically suspected myocarditis (Level of Evidence C). Under recommendations with uncertainty, endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) may be considered in those patients with clinically suspected myocarditis who meet the criteria listed. As a strategy to avoid with concern for no benefit, in the absence of ventricular arrhythmias or syncope, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is not indicated acutely for patients with recent-onset dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 30% caused by clinically suspected or confirmed myocarditis (Level of Evidence C).

Myocarditis — diagnostic criteria for clinically suspected myocarditis specify that clinically suspected myocarditis requires ≥ 1 clinical presentation and ≥ 1 diagnostic criteria from different categories in the absence of angiographically detectable coronary artery disease (coronary stenosis ≥ 50%) or other preexisting cardiovascular/extracardiac causes; if the patient is asymptomatic, ≥ 2 diagnostic criteria should be met, and suspicion is higher with higher number of fulfilled criteria. Clinical presentations include acute chest pain that is pericarditic or pseudoischemic; new onset (days up to 3 mo) or worsening of dyspnea and/or fatigue with or without signs of left- and/or right-sided heart failure; subacute/chronic (> 3 mo) or worsening dyspnea or fatigue with or without left- and/or right-sided heart failure; palpitation and/or unexplained arrhythmia symptoms and/or syncope and/or aborted sudden cardiac death; and unexplained cardiogenic shock. Diagnostic criteria categories are: I. ECG/Holter/stress test features with new abnormal 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and/or Holter stress testing listing conduction and rhythm abnormalities; II. Myocardio/cytolysis markers with elevated troponin T (TnT) or troponin I (TnI); III.

### Arrhythmias in myocarditis: state of the art [^112rQDer]. Heart Rhythm (2019). Medium credibility.

Many kinds of arrhythmias may occur in patients with myocarditis at any stage of the disease. However, compared to the other clinical presentations, arrhythmic myocarditis has been poorly described in the literature. Arrhythmias occurring in either ongoing or previous myocardial inflammation are complex and heterogeneous, and the disease itself is often underdiagnosed, thus limiting data collection and interpretation. However, different from the other clinical presentations, arrhythmic myocarditis requires specific diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic considerations. The aim of this review is to critically summarize the state of the art on myocarditis presenting with arrhythmias in terms of epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Evaluation and management for return to play (RTP) in competitive athletes evolved from an initial recommendation that triad testing be included for all competitive athletes with symptomatic COVID-19 to later guidance recommending cardiac testing only in those with moderate, severe, and/or worsening symptoms; despite this, many athletes continued triad testing even when asymptomatic. Registries have established a low prevalence of clinical myocarditis among competitive athletes with COVID-19, and symptoms suggestive of myocarditis can help predict cardiac involvement. The athlete population spans from youth sports (aged < 18 years) to masters-level (aged > 35 years), with prior encouragement to observe younger athletes (aged < 21 years) for several weeks for MIS-C. Current data indicate that competitive athletes with mild, noncardiopulmonary symptoms are unlikely to have myocarditis or clinically significant myocardial involvement, a pattern mirrored in health care workers (n = 149, aged 18–63 years) where mild symptoms were not associated with discernable cardiovascular pathology; persistent cardiopulmonary symptoms are likely more relevant than age or competition level when estimating clinically important myocardial disease probability.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1174vyje]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Myocarditis — pathogenesis and immune features describe a 3-phase model in humans consisting of acute injury, a host innate and acquired immunologic response, and finally, recovery or a transition to fibrosis and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) over several weeks to months, with the peak of inflammation often following a clinical viral illness by a few days to weeks. The initial injury can cause an acute DCM with contractile impairment mediated by cytokines and direct viral myocyte injury, and after several months the same dilated ventricle can result from diffuse scar with little or no inflammation; the transition from acute myocarditis to chronic fibrotic DCM probably occurs over months with substantial individual variability. An interleukin 17–producing CD4+ T-cell subtype appears to mediate fibrosis after myocarditis in murine models, T-regulatory cells can suppress Th17 cell function and are decreased in myocarditis and DCM, and therapies such as immunoadsorption of anti-heart antibodies can increase T-regulatory and decrease T-effector cell levels. Measurement of multiple viral titers in the blood is expensive and has not proven to be very useful over the years.

Challenges in Capturing the Full Clinical Spectrum of Myocarditis

While definite acute myocarditis forms the tip of the iceberg of the myocarditis spectrum, a large proportion of patients in clinical practice do not undergo myocarditis testing, leading to missed opportunities in diagnosis (Figure 3). The wide spectrum of clinical manifestations of myocarditis (chest pain, dyspnea/heart failure, syncope or arrhythmia‐related) results that patients will be seen across multiple cardiology subspecialties. Raising clinical suspicion of myocarditis is essential to establish a diagnosis of definite myocarditis.

Figure 3
Clinical spectrum of myocarditis.

Probable myocarditis is the setting in which endomyocardial biopsy or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging generates borderline/inconclusive results. Definite myocarditis includes cases with a confirmed diagnosis in line with Figure 2. Unexplored myocarditis includes cases in which no confirmatory investigations (endomyocardial biopsy or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging) regarding the presence of myocarditis are performed. CMR indicates cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; EMB, endomyocardial biopsy; MINOCA, myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries; NICMP, nonischemic cardiomyopathy; PVC, premature ventricular complexes; VT, ventricular tachycardia; º, case finding in electrophysiology; *, case finding in interventional cardiology; and, case finding in heart failure and imaging.

For example, around 33% of patients with myocardial infarction with normal coronary arteries may get a diagnosis of myocarditis based on CMR assessment. Similarly, myocarditis can be found in patients with frequent PVCs or ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). Detailed analysis with CMR or fluroredeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG‐PET) in patients with frequent PVCs (not attributable to other reasons) illustrates a diagnosis of myocarditis in up to 38% to 51%. Myocarditis has been found in around 10% of patients with a nonischemic cardiomyopathy undergoing VA ablation. Similarly, third degree atrioventricular block in younger patients (< 55 years) should trigger a search for specific forms of myocarditis (sarcoidosis, giant cell myocarditis, Lyme carditis). Finally, EMB analysis in patients with a chronic (> 3 months) unexplained cardiomyopathy reveals underlying myocarditis in 9% to 40% of patients.

### The pathogenesis and long-term consequences of COVID-19 cardiac injury [^1167PCb9]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical characteristics of the reported cases of SARS-CoV-2-related myocarditis

The clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2-related myocarditis is, in general, highly variable and nonspecific, partly because of a lack of definitive investigations discussed under "Background". The reported presenting symptoms range from relatively mild (eg, fatigue and dyspnea), to more severe (eg, chest pain on exertion and hemodynamic instability). However, even in cases in which myocarditis is eventually confirmed, presenting symptoms may not be cardiac specific. In general, the cardiac disease was suspected when abnormal electrocardiographic changes and elevated troponins were identified, even when the patients had minimal cardiac symptoms at presentation. Conversely, some patients without overt cardiac symptoms at presentation have gone on to develop acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock, demonstrating how variable COVID-19 myocarditis can be over the duration of illness.

In the most severe presentation, patients have developed fulminant myocarditis, defined as acute ventricular dysfunction and heart failure within 2 to 3 weeks of contracting the virus. Although most of these patients are young and recovered fully after pharmacologic management, some patients progressed to require durable mechanical circulatory support in response to persistent severe ventricular dysfunction. Because of the nonspecificity of COVID-19-related myocarditis reported to date, other diagnoses should also be considered and a clear diagnostic algorithm used. The clinical characteristics of reported cases of COVID-19-related myocarditis (as of September 2021) are summarized in Supplemental Table 1.

### Myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy: current evidence and future directions [^1128XnMc]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Inflammatory cardiomyopathy, characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration into the myocardium and a high risk of deteriorating cardiac function, has a heterogeneous aetiology. Inflammatory cardiomyopathy is predominantly mediated by viral infection, but can also be induced by bacterial, protozoal or fungal infections as well as a wide variety of toxic substances and drugs and systemic immune-mediated diseases. Despite extensive research, inflammatory cardiomyopathy complicated by left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure or arrhythmia is associated with a poor prognosis. At present, the reason why some patients recover without residual myocardial injury whereas others develop dilated cardiomyopathy is unclear. The relative roles of the pathogen, host genomics and environmental factors in disease progression and healing are still under discussion, including which viruses are active inducers and which are only bystanders. As a consequence, treatment strategies are not well established. In this Review, we summarize and evaluate the available evidence on the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy, with a special focus on virus-induced and virus-associated myocarditis. Furthermore, we identify knowledge gaps, appraise the available experimental models and propose future directions for the field. The current knowledge and open questions regarding the cardiovascular effects associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are also discussed. This Review is the result of scientific cooperation of members of the Heart Failure Association of the ESC, the Heart Failure Society of America and the Japanese Heart Failure Society.

### Myocarditis associated with COVID-19 vaccination [^114aseub]. NPJ Vaccines (2024). Medium credibility.

Full disease spectrum of COVID-19 vaccine associated myocarditis captured?

Studies on myocarditis associated with COVID-19 vaccination are hampered by several limitations such as: the absence of reliable estimates of the clinically suspected myocarditis frequency in the population prior to COVID19 pandemic, as well as lack of a systematic collection of endomyocardial biopsies to support the confirmation of the diagnosis, especially for clinically mild cases in which collecting biopsies is not warranted. Of note, usually biopsies are not taken, and MRI is not performed in clinically mild cases.

In a study specifically including recently (≤ 20 days) COVID-19 vaccinated individuals that died unexpectedly, it was shown that most of these cases displayed an inflammatory infiltration of the epicardium and the subepicardial fat tissue. This infiltrate was characterized by an identical T cell-dominant immunophenotype and interspersed macrophages. An acute arrhythmogenic cardiac failure was postulated due to the limited pathology observed. No causal association with COVID-19 vaccination can be asserted from this study, but the authors suggested that CD4 + T cells are the main drivers of heart-specific autoimmunity in myocarditis. Additional research is required to assess the relevance of the results obtained.

### A Bayesian network analysis quantifying risks versus benefits of the pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in Australia [^114remPj]. NPJ Vaccines (2022). Medium credibility.

Myocarditis

Acute myocarditis can result in myocardial inflammation from either an infectious or immune-mediated aetiology. Thus, our model compared the risk of Pfizer vaccine-associated myocarditis with the risk of myocarditis in COVID-19 patients. While often asymptomatic, myocarditis may present as chest pain, palpitations and/or dysrhythmias – and can cause dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia and/or sudden cardiac death. In Australia, myocarditis is often diagnosed using electrocardiogram, serum troponin levels, inflammatory markers, chest X-ray, echocardiography and occasionally endomyocardial biopsy. However, these methods can underestimate the presence of myocarditis in comparison to more sensitive cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is considered the gold-standard for non-invasive diagnosis worldwide. The 2018 Lake Louise criteria for MRI-based diagnosis of myocarditis targets tissue-based imaging markers of oedema, hyperaemia, necrosis and fibrosis. To ensure the diagnosis of myocarditis was made robustly in our model, data reporting myocarditis cases diagnosed via cardiac MRI were used wherever possible.

While both the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and COVID-19 itself may also be associated with pericarditis, either separately or simultaneously with myocarditis, this model focuses solely on myocarditis. This is because diagnostic criteria for pericarditis are not well-defined, and because it is less common than myocarditis. In studies that reported 'myocarditis/pericarditis', we estimated that ~65% of cases were attributable to myocarditis, based on proportions of cases reported in studies that differentiate between them.

The definitions for vaccine-associated and infection-induced myocarditis used for the model reflect those used within the studies from which data were drawn. Vaccine-associated myocarditis was defined as confirmed or suspected myocarditis occurring within 2 months of vaccine administration (with most cases occurring within the first 10 days), and COVID-19-related myocarditis was defined as myocarditis that occurred within 6 months of COVID-19 diagnosis.

### Myocarditis [^111Wowye]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Myocarditis is an underdiagnosed cause of acute heart failure, sudden death, and chronic dilated cardiomyopathy. In developed countries, viral infections commonly cause myocarditis; however, in the developing world, rheumatic carditis, Trypanosoma cruzi, and bacterial infections such as diphtheria still contribute to the global burden of the disease. The short-term prognosis of acute myocarditis is usually good, but varies widely by cause. Those patients who initially recover might develop recurrent dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure, sometimes years later. Because myocarditis presents with non-specific symptoms including chest pain, dyspnoea, and palpitations, it often mimics more common disorders such as coronary artery disease. In some patients, cardiac MRI and endomyocardial biopsy can help identify myocarditis, predict risk of cardiovascular events, and guide treatment. Finding effective therapies has been challenging because the pathogenesis of chronic dilated cardiomyopathy after viral myocarditis is complex and determined by host and viral genetics as well as environmental factors. Findings from recent clinical trials suggest that some patients with chronic inflammatory cardiomyopathy have a progressive clinical course despite standard medical care and might improve with a short course of immunosuppression.

### Effects of statins on myocarditis: a review of underlying molecular mechanisms [^115oKKR7]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Myocarditis refers to the clinical and histological characteristics of a diverse range of inflammatory cellular pathophysiological conditions which result in cardiac dysfunction. Myocarditis is a major cause of mortality in individuals less than 40 years of age and accounts for approximately 20% of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Myocarditis contributes to dilated cardiomyopathy in 30% of patients and can progress to cardiac arrest, which has a poor prognosis of < 40% survival over 10 years. Myocarditis has also been documented after infection with SARS-CoV-2. The most commonly used lipid-lowering therapies, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), decrease CVD-related morbidity and mortality. In addition to their lipid-lowering effects, increasing evidence supports the existence of several additional beneficial, 'pleiotropic' effects of statins. Recently, several studies have indicated that statins may attenuate myocarditis. Statins modify the lipid oxidation, inflammation, immunomodulation, and endothelial activity of the pathophysiology and have been recommended as adjuvant treatment. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms of action of statins and their effects on myocarditis, SARS-CoV-2 and CVD.

### CfDNA methylation detection as potential liquid biopsy of multiple organ injury in myocarditis patients [^1152Yk4Y]. Clinical Epigenetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Severe cytokine storm is evident by cfDNA methylation sequencing and plasma inflammatory factor testing in patients with fulminant myocarditis

To explore the differences in cfDNA expression patterns between donors and patients with fulminant myocarditis and clinically suspected myocarditis, genome-wide methylation sequences of cfDNA in plasma from patients with myocarditis and fulminant myocarditis were examined using the GM-seq technique. We found that global methylation levels decrease sequentially from donors to clinically suspected myocarditis patients and then to fulminant myocarditis patients, and these differences are significant (Fig. 1 B). Compared to cfDNA from patients with myocarditis, cfDNA from patients with fulminant myocarditis had 18,356 DMRs. Specifically, in the cfDNA of patients with fulminant myocarditis, up to 99.76% of DMRs were hypomethylated, compared to only 0.24% in samples from patients with clinically suspected myocarditis (Fig. 1 C). Similar conclusions can also be drawn when comparing the DMRs between the donors and the patients with clinically suspected myocarditis and fulminant myocarditis (Fig. S1). These DMRs are predominantly located in intergenic and intron regions (Fig. S2), and approximately 80% of them are related to the immune response (Figs. 1 D, S3). Further analysis of DMRs in promoter regions revealed that in patients with fulminant myocarditis, genes involved in immune-related pathways, including the IL2, IL6, interferon gamma, inflammatory response, interferon alpha, and TNF-α (via NFκB) pathways, were mostly hypomethylated (Fig. 1 E). Due to the fact that the level of methylation of the promoter region of a gene is usually inversely correlated with the transcription level of the gene, the expression level of inflammatory pathways is therefore higher in the fulminant myocarditis group compared to the clinically suspected myocarditis group. Compared to donors, these pathways are also hypomethylated in patients with clinically suspected myocarditis and fulminant myocarditis (Figs. S4, S5). Next, we measured IL6, IL8, and IFN-γ levels in remaining blood samples from patients. On average, the fulminant myocarditis group exhibited higher levels of inflammatory factors than the clinically suspected myocarditis group, but the differences were not significant (Fig. 1 F, G).

### COVID-19 associated myocarditis: a systematic review [^112Rgpb5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Most COVID-19 infections result in a viral syndrome characterized by fever, cough, shortness of breath, and myalgias. A small but significant proportion of patients develop severe COVID-19 resulting in respiratory failure. Many of these patients also develop multi-organ dysfunction as a byproduct of their critical illness. Although heart failure can be a part of this, there also appears to be a subset of patients who have primary cardiac collapse from COVID-19.

Objective

Conduct a systematic review of COVID-19-associated myocarditis, including clinical presentation, risk factors, and prognosis.

Discussion

Our review demonstrates two distinct etiologies of primary acute heart failure in surprisingly equal incidence in patients with COVID-19: viral myocarditis and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. COVID myocarditis, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and severe COVID-19 can be clinically indistinguishable. All can present with dyspnea and evidence of cardiac injury, although in myocarditis and Takotsubo this is due to primary cardiac dysfunction as compared to respiratory failure in severe COVID-19.

Conclusion

COVID-19-associated myocarditis differs from COVID-19 respiratory failure by an early shock state. However, not all heart failure from COVID-19 is from direct viral infection; some patient's develop takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Regardless of etiology, steroids may be a beneficial treatment, similar to other critically ill COVID-19 patients. Evidence of cardiac injury in the form of ECG changes or elevated troponin in patients with COVID-19 should prompt providers to consider concurrent myocarditis.

### Clinical outcomes of myocarditis after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in four nordic countries: population based cohort study [^111VrH7R]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Myocarditis is a rare adverse event after vaccination with the two mRNA vaccines, tozinameran (BNT162b2) and elasomeran (mRNA-1273), against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The risk seems to be highest in younger age groups, in men, and after the second dose of vaccine, with the number of excess patients with myocarditis per 100 000 men aged 16–24 years after a second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine estimated at 5.6 per 100 000 for tozinameran and 18.4 per 100 000 for elasomeran. How the clinical outcomes of myocarditis after vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines compare with outcomes after other types of myocarditis, such as myocarditis associated with covid-19 disease and myocarditis not related to covid-19 or vaccination (ie, conventional myocarditis) is unclear.

The clinical outcomes of myocarditis range from no sequelae to chronic heart failure or death. Hence a large scale evaluation of the clinical outcomes of these two new types of myocarditis compared with conventional myocarditis is needed to better evaluate the risks and benefits of vaccination, especially in younger individuals. Based on nationwide data on all incident admissions to hospital for myocarditis in 2018–22, sourced from a population of 23 million individuals in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, we compared the clinical outcomes of myocarditis associated with vaccination, myocarditis associated with covid-19 disease, and conventional myocarditis, with respect to readmission to hospital, heart failure, and death.

Myocarditis — noninfectious and inflammatory subtypes highlight that cardiac sarcoidosis often affects the heart without clinical evidence of extracardiac disease, a minority of subacute or early chronic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) cases can have active inflammation and improve with immunosuppression, and giant cell myocarditis is an aggressive, noninfectious autoimmune disorder that is rapidly fatal without advanced HF treatment and multidrug immunosuppression; in new DCM with an elevated eosinophil count, a hypersensitivity reaction to a drug or vaccine or an idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome should be considered.

### Myopericardial complications following COVID-19 disease and vaccination: a clinical consensus statement of the European Society of Cardiology working group on myocardial and pericardial diseases [^112gK5ws]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

The aim of the present clinical consensus statement of the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Diseases is to review the current knowledge on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, therapy, and outcomes of myocardial and pericardial complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and vaccination in order to improve the awareness and clinical confidence on the management of patients with these complications. The risk of myopericardial complications is especially higher within 1 month of COVID-19 disease and vaccination. Forms related to the disease are generally more common and severe than those related to vaccination. Even if vaccination against COVID-19 increases myocarditis risk, this risk is lower in vaccinated than non-vaccinated COVID-19 individuals, supporting the vaccine use. Overall, COVID-19 related complications, especially myocarditis, are relatively rare.

### CfDNA methylation detection as potential liquid biopsy of multiple organ injury in myocarditis patients [^113h52gn]. Clinical Epigenetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Myocarditis is inflammatory injury of the myocardium and causes approximately 30,000 deaths globally each year. Fulminant myocarditis is an extremely severe form of myocarditis. Currently, the clinical evaluation of myocarditis and fulminant myocarditis is primarily based on symptoms, ECG findings, and biochemical markers. Cardiac magnetic resonance and endomyocardial biopsy can provide further support for the diagnosis, but both have limitations in routine practice. Recent studies have shown that cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has distinct methylation patterns depending on the organ of origin, suggesting new possibilities for tracking specific types of organ damage. The core mechanism of fulminant myocarditis is a cytokine storm, leading to multiorgan damage, differing from clinically suspected myocarditis. We performed Genome-wide cfDNA methylation detection on plasma from 20 healthy donors and 22 patients (fulminant myocarditis: clinically suspected myocarditis = 9:13, COVID-19 positive: COVID-19 negative = 14:8) and found that cfDNA can be used to specifically identify early multiorgan damage caused by fulminant myocarditis, and its AUC is superior to traditional biochemical indicators such as troponin, high-sensitivity troponin, and lactate dehydrogenase. This is critically important for the timely clinical recognition and treatment of this condition. Furthermore, our study findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may exacerbate the severity of myocarditis and multiorgan damage. In summary, cfDNA shows great potential as a noninvasive, early, and sensitive biomarker for reflecting disease severity and systemic injury in fulminant myocarditis, which may help guide earlier risk stratification and intervention.

### Management of myocarditis-related cardiomyopathy in adults [^115c5QeF]. Circulation Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Myocarditis is generally a mild and self-limited consequence of systemic infection of cardiotropic viruses. However, patients can develop a temporary or permanent impairment of cardiac function including acute cardiomyopathy with hemodynamic compromise or severe arrhythmias. In this setting, specific causes of inflammation are associated with variable risks of death and transplantation. Recent translational studies suggest that treatments tailored to specific causes of myocarditis may impact clinical outcomes when added to guideline-directed medical care. This review summarizes recent advances in translational research that influence the utility of endomyocardial biopsy for the management of inflammatory cardiomyopathies. Emerging therapies for myocarditis based on these mechanistic hypotheses are entering clinical trials and may add to the benefits of established heart failure treatment.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) prognostic evidence in acute myocarditis indicates that, in a study of 24 patients, a repeat CMR 3 months after diagnosis was more sensitive for persistent myocardial inflammation than serial echocardiography or repeated biomarkers; in another study of 187 hemodynamically stable patients (ITAMY Registry), healing (absence of edema and LGE) was present in only 11% at 6-month follow-up. Patients with LGE and no edema on follow-up CMR at 6 months had the worst prognosis (19 of 22 had cardiac events during the 7-year follow-up period), whereas those with no LGE and no edema had the best prognosis (no cardiac events). In multivariable analysis, independent predictors of cardiac events were a midwall septal LGE pattern on follow-up CMR (HR: 2.8; 95% CI: 1.1–7.2; P = 0.028) and persistence of LGE without edema on follow-up CMR (HR: 4.5; 95% CI: 1.3–14.5; P = 0.008). Myocardial T1 and T2 relaxation times may remain elevated on follow-up CMR, but the prognostic significance of such findings remains unclear, and serial 18F-FDG PET imaging, if pursued, should be performed with a similar patient preparation as used in the initial scan leading to the diagnosis of myocarditis.

Fulminant myocarditis on VA-ECMO — outcomes, prognostic factors, and unloading strategies: In registry data, "approximately one-third of patients with fulminant myocarditis supported by VA-ECMO required a durable LVAD, transplant, or died at 90 days". A meta-analysis of "54 observational studies" with "2,388 patients" reported "a short-term mortality of 35%". "Conversion from peripheral to central cannulation for VA-ECMO does not seem to improve outcome". Prognostic factors include favorable "early administration of IVIG" or "performance of an EMB", and unfavorable "ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation at admission, an elevated CRP, and higher peak creatine kinase-MB levels". Regarding ventricular unloading, "Unloading of the LV via axial flow devices, such as the IMPELLA, may contribute to myocardial recovery", potentially by reducing mechano-transduction–driven inflammation.

2.1.2. Myocarditis

Myocarditis is a prevalent form of MINOCA, representing a third of clinical cases of MINOCA. 11 There are various causes of myocarditis, which include viral causes, such as parvovirus B19, coxsackie virus, human herpes virus 6, and adenovirus. Viral causes account for the majority of the cases of biopsy‐confirmed myocarditis. 11 There are also other causes of myocarditis, such as autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], cardiac sarcoidosis, giant cell myocarditis, and eosinophilic myocarditis. The presentation of myocarditis may be similar to that of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with angina, with or without ST‐segment elevation on electrocardiogram, presence of increased serum levels of troponins with the presence or absence of ventricular dysfunction in the presence of non‐obstructive coronary arteries. The pathology that underlies myocarditis resulting in this presentation rests on the presence of coronary microvascular constriction resulting in decreased myocardial perfusion. Early diagnosis of myocarditis is important as it impacts prognosis and management. Although half of these patients will have resolution of their presentation in a 2‐4 week period, up to 25% of these patients will acutely decompensate to fulminant heart failure. This is particularly true for giant cell myocarditis. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) should be one of the initial tests performed in cases of suspected myocarditis. CMR has been reported to be able to detect 79% of endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) proven myocarditis. 13 The value of EMB is that it allows the underlying cause of myocarditis to be determined. Treatment of myocarditis particularly patients with ventricular dysfunction includes the use of beta blockers and angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE‐I). 14 Immunosuppression is useful in the treatment of EMB has proven infection negative autoimmune forms of myocarditis, such as giant cell myocarditis, cardiac sarcoidosis, and eosinophilic myocarditis. 11

Relative risk of incident heart failure or death within 90 days of follow-up from admission to hospital for new onset myocarditis in individuals with myocarditis associated with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination, myocarditis associated with covid-19 disease, and conventional myocarditis (Nordic myocarditis cohort)

For estimates of the risk of heart failure in individual countries, we found similar patterns for myocarditis associated with vaccination and conventional myocarditis across the Nordics countries (online supplemental figure S1); limited statistical power did not allow calculation of risk estimates for myocarditis associated with covid-19 disease. We found no indication of differences between the Nordic countries for the risk of death for patients with vaccination type myocarditis within 90 days of follow-up, although statistical power was limited because of few deaths (online supplemental figure S2). In combined meta-analyses, we found that estimates of risk for both heart failure and death were lower for patients with myocarditis associated with vaccination compared with conventional myocarditis for all time points during follow-up (figure 1).

"Temporary and DMCS should be considered… as a bridge to recovery", with efforts to identify and reverse causes, and "assessment of the underlying myocardial function should occur before proceeding to long-term LVAD support or heart transplantation". Recommendations include: "For patients with myocarditis on short-term support an assessment of the underlying myocardial function should be performed before proceeding to DMCS or heart transplantation… I (Level of Evidence: C)" and "When tolerated, adjuvant medical therapy with neurohormonal and beta blockade should be considered during mechanical support for acute myocarditis to promote recovery… IIa (Level of Evidence: C)".

Immune-Mediated Myocarditis

OPDUALAG can cause immune-mediated myocarditis, which is defined as requiring use of steroids and no clear alternate etiology. The diagnosis of immune-mediated myocarditis requires a high index of suspicion. Patients with cardiac or cardio-pulmonary symptoms should be assessed for potential myocarditis. If myocarditis is suspected, withhold dose, promptly initiate high dose steroids (prednisone or methylprednisolone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day) and promptly arrange cardiology consultation with diagnostic workup. If clinically confirmed, permanently discontinue OPDUALAG for Grade 2–4 myocarditis [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Myocarditis occurred in 1.7% (6/355) of patients receiving OPDUALAG, including Grade 3 (0.6%), and Grade 2 (1.1%) adverse reactions. Myocarditis led to permanent discontinuation of OPDUALAG in 1.7% of patients.

Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% (6/6) of patients with myocarditis. Myocarditis resolved in 100% of the 6 patients.

Immune Response During Murine Autoimmune CVB3 Myocarditis and Experimental Autoimmune Model

Animal models of myocarditis have yielded a wealth of information about the pathogenesis of disease including a number of landmark articles that demonstrate that myocarditis is an autoimmune disease that requires TLR activation by microbes. Immune pathways that are similar between COVID-19 and the pathogenesis of myocarditis in autoimmune animal models (and verified to some extent in patients) are summarized below. All 3 pathways of complement are upregulated in the serum of patients with myocarditis and predict progression to DCM. Mice with experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) or autoimmune CVB3 myocarditis also upregulate complement components during the innate immune response and acute myocarditis including C3, CD11b (also known as CR [complement receptor] 3), C3aR, and C5aR. – Elevated expression of C3aR (and CD68+ macrophages) was found in patients with myocarditis compared with those with cardiomyopathy without inflammation. The majority of immune cells in the heart during acute myocarditis in EAM, the autoimmune CVB3 myocarditis model, and humans are CD11b+ cells that include neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, and some dendritic cells. Mouse strains that have many mast cells like BALB/c and A/J develop myocarditis that most closely resembles lymphocytic myocarditis that progresses to DCM. Mast cells work in cooperation with macrophages to increase profibrotic inflammation and remodeling that leads to scar and DCM (Figure 4).

### Biomarker trends, incidence, and outcomes of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced myocarditis [^1129f8bp]. JACC: CardioOncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Myocarditis is a dreaded and unpredictable complication of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). We sought to determine whether routinely measured biomarkers could be helpful in monitoring for ICI myocarditis.

Objectives

The authors examined biomarker trends of patients on ICI and their association with the incidence of ICI myocarditis and outcomes.

Methods

We conducted an observational cohort study of adults who received at least one dose of ICI at Michigan Medicine between June 2014 and December 2021 and underwent systematic serial testing for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and lactate dehydrogenase during ICI therapy.

Results

Among 2,606 patients (mean age 64 ± 13 years; 60.7% men), 27 (1.0%) were diagnosed with ICI myocarditis. At diagnosis, patients with myocarditis had an elevated high-sensitivity troponin T (100%), ALT (88.9%), AST (85.2%), CPK (88.9%), and lactate dehydrogenase (92.6%). Findings were confirmed in an independent cohort of 30 patients with biopsy-confirmed ICI myocarditis. A total of 95% of patients with ICI myocarditis had elevations in at least 3 biomarkers compared with 5% of patients without myocarditis. Among the noncardiac biomarkers, only CPK was associated (per 100% increase) with the development of myocarditis (HR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.59–2.10) and all-cause mortality (HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.01–1.20) in multivariable analysis. Elevations in CPK had a sensitivity of 99% and specificity of 23% for identifying myocarditis.

Conclusions

ICI myocarditis is associated with changes in AST, ALT, and CPK. An increase in noncardiac biomarkers during ICI treatment, notably CPK, should prompt further evaluation for ICI myocarditis.

### Clozapine [^112sFjrz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Seizures

Seizures have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is dose-related. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg, titrate gradually, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (CNS pathology, medications that lower the seizure threshold, alcohol abuse). Caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Cardiomyopathy and Mitral Valve Incompetence

Fatal myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with clozapine treatment. Discontinue clozapine and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of these reactions. Generally, patients with clozapine-related myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine. Consider the possibility of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy if chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations, dyspnea, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, or ECG changes occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Clozapine is not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Absolute and relative risk of readmission

At 90 days of follow-up from discharge for new onset myocarditis, 62 (11.7%), nine (8.3%), and 988 (14.9%) patients were readmitted to hospital in the vaccination type, covid-19 type, and conventional myocarditis groups, respectively. The relative risk of readmission between types of myocarditis within 90 days of discharge from hospital, with conventional myocarditis as the reference, was 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.62 to 1.00) for patients with myocarditis associated with vaccination and 0.55 (0.30 to 1.04) for patients with myocarditis associated with covid-19 disease (table 3). Online supplemental figure S3 presents the risk of readmission in the vaccination and conventional myocarditis groups in 10 day periods for each country. In a combined Nordic analysis, we found that the estimated risk of readmission to hospital was numerically lower for patients with myocarditis associated with vaccination compared with those with conventional myocarditis at all periods during follow-up (online supplemental figure S4).

### COVID-19, myocarditis and pericarditis [^113SBSpw]. Circulation Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall, most cases of myocarditis associated with vaccines have been reported to be mild and of short duration. Most patients are hospitalized only to monitor for arrhythmias and heart failure, rather than for severe signs and symptoms. Cases of vaccine-related myocarditis are similar to cases of lymphocytic myocarditis attributed to viral and autoimmune myocarditis, which are also mild, with normal left ventricular ejection fraction and a moderately quick recovery. Because most of the vaccine cases appear mild, evaluation of the heart using cMRI or EMB is typically not conducted. This is likely also true for many mild cases of non–vaccine-related myocarditis. Most cases of vaccine-induced myocarditis fall into the clinically suspected or probable cases diagnostic categories. Several studies included only cases with elevated troponins, but as discussed earlier, elevated troponins should not be required for a diagnosis of myocarditis as they are unreliable biomarkers for myocarditis and may select only more severe cases.

5.1	Congestive Heart Failure

Among the 355 patients who received ROZLYTREK across clinical trials, congestive heart failure (CHF) occurred in 3.4% of patients, including Grade 3 (2.3%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In clinical trials, baseline cardiac function and routine cardiac monitoring other than electrocardiograms (ECGs) were not conducted and eligibility criteria excluded patients with symptomatic CHF, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and coronary artery bypass graft within 3 months of study entry. Among the 12 patients with CHF, the median time to onset was 2 months (range: 11 days to 12 months). ROZLYTREK was interrupted in 6 of these patients (50%) and discontinued in 2 of these patients (17%). CHF resolved in 6 patients (50%) following interruption or discontinuation of ROZLYTREK and institution of appropriate medical management. In addition, myocarditis in the absence of CHF was documented in 0.3% of patients.

Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prior to initiation of ROZLYTREK. Monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of CHF, including shortness of breath and edema. For patients with myocarditis, with or without a decreased ejection fraction, MRI or cardiac biopsy may be required to make the diagnosis. For patients with new onset or worsening CHF, withhold ROZLYTREK, institute appropriate medical management, and reassess LVEF. Based on the severity of CHF or worsening LVEF, resume ROZLYTREK at a reduced dose upon recovery to baseline or permanently discontinue [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

### Mortality in primary and secondary myocarditis [^114bRRng]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Lymphocytic myocarditis presents as a primary disorder or in association with a systemic disease. Whether primary and secondary myocarditis have the same prognosis is unknown.

Methods

Patients (n = 171) referred to the Johns Hopkins Cardiomyopathy service from 1984 to 1998 with newly diagnosed cardiomyopathy were observed for an average of 5.9 years after an original diagnosis of biopsy-proven myocarditis or until reaching the end point of death. Giant-cell myocarditis was excluded from this study. Myocarditis was classified as secondary when a systemic disease was present at the time of presentation; otherwise, myocarditis was classified as primary. Survival rates among patients with primary and secondary myocarditis were compared with Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard models incorporating clinical variables, including baseline hemodynamics and treatment with immunosuppressive therapy.

Results

The mortality rate associated with secondary myocarditis varied substantially depending on the underlying systemic disorder. Peripartum myocarditis, when compared with idiopathic myocarditis, had a reduced mortality rate (relative hazard, 0.23 [0.06–0.98]; P < .05), which was attenuated after controlling for confounding variables (relative hazard, 0.62 [0.13–2.98]; P = 0.55). In contrast, human immunodeficiency virus myocarditis had a particularly poor prognosis (relative hazard, 6.70 [3.51–12.79]; P < .05), even after controlling for confounding variables. Myocarditis associated with systemic inflammatory disorders showed a trend toward increased mortality rate (relative hazard, 2.46 [0.65–9.38]; P = 0.19). For both primary and secondary myocarditis, advanced age and pulmonary hypertension were important clinical predictors of death.

Conclusions

The prognosis of patients with secondary myocarditis, when compared with patients with idiopathic myocarditis, seems most affected by the primary disease process.

### Clinical outcomes of myocarditis after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in four nordic countries: population based cohort study [^1117CyZ4]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Objective

To investigate the clinical outcomes of myocarditis associated with mRNA vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus compared with other types of myocarditis.

Design

Population based cohort study.

Setting

Nationwide register data from four Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden), from 1 January 2018 to the latest date of follow-up in 2022.

Participants

The Nordic myocarditis cohort; 7292 individuals aged ≥ 12 years who had an incident diagnosis of myocarditis as a main or secondary diagnosis, in a population of 23 million individuals in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden.

Main outcome measures

Heart failure, or death from any cause within 90 days of admission to hospital for new onset myocarditis, and hospital readmission within 90 days of discharge to hospital for new onset myocarditis. Clinical outcomes of myocarditis associated with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination, covid-19 disease, and conventional myocarditis were compared.

Results

In 2018–22, 7292 patients were admitted to hospital with new onset myocarditis, with 530 (7.3%) categorised as having myocarditis associated with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination, 109 (1.5%) with myocarditis associated with covid-19 disease, and 6653 (91.2%) with conventional myocarditis. At the 90 day follow-up, 62, nine, and 988 patients had been readmitted to hospital in each group (vaccination, covid-19, and conventional myocarditis groups, respectively), corresponding to a relative risk of readmission of 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.62 to 1.00) and 0.55 (0.30 to 1.04) for the vaccination type and covid-19 type myocarditis groups, respectively, compared with the conventional myocarditis group. At the 90 day follow-up, 27, 18, and 616 patients had a diagnosis of heart failure or died in the vaccination type, covid-19 type, and conventional myocarditis groups, respectively. The relative risk of heart failure within 90 days was 0.56 (95% confidence interval 0.37 to 0.85) and 1.48 (0.86 to 2.54) for myocarditis associated with vaccination and covid-19 disease, respectively, compared with conventional myocarditis; the relative risk of death was 0.48 (0.21 to 1.09) and 2.35 (1.06 to 5.19), respectively. Among patients aged 12–39 years with no predisposing comorbidities, the relative risk of heart failure or death was markedly higher for myocarditis associated with covid-19 disease than for myocarditis associated with vaccination (relative risk 5.78, 1.84 to 18.20).

Conclusions

Compared with myocarditis associated with covid-19 disease and conventional myocarditis, myocarditis after vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines was associated with better clinical outcomes within 90 days of admission to hospital.

### Cardiac MRI in patients with COVID-19 infection [^1114hGpX]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Generally, the clinical presentation of myocarditis varies from mild symptoms, such as fatigue and dyspnoea, to a fulminant course with heart failure and cardiogenic shock. Imaging plays a crucial role in the characterization of different aspects of acute myocardial injury and enables a definite diagnosis and early treatment. Cardiac MRI (CMRI) is the reference standard for assessing patients with suspected myocarditis. CMRI provides detailed anatomical visualization, quantitative accuracy, and interobserver consistency with volumetric and functional assessment.

T1 and T2 mapping techniques have been explored in pursuit of more quantitative and objective markers of inflammation in myocarditis to increase diagnostic accuracy. Their values are being recognized as not only robust biomarkers for the diagnosis of cardiomyopathies but also predictive factors for treatment monitoring and prognosis.

Our study aimed to characterize the different aspects of myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19 infection using cardiac biomarkers and cardiac imaging with special emphasis on cardiac MRI as the modality of choice to differentiate between the different aspects of COVID-related myocardial injury.

Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. CLOZARIL is not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### Clinical outcomes of myocarditis after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in four nordic countries: population based cohort study [^116qcZy5]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Results

Characteristics of the Nordic myocarditis cohort

Our cohort included 7292 patients with a diagnosis of myocarditis; 530 (7.3%) were categorised as having myocarditis associated with vaccination, 109 (1.5%) were associated with covid-19 disease, and 6653 (91.2%) had conventional myocarditis (table 1). Patients were predominantly men (5304 (72.7%) overall) and 3715 (50.9%) were aged < 40 years. Online supplemental table S4 shows median (interquartile range) age by type of myocarditis, age group, and country. Eighty five (16.0%), 54 (49.5%), and 1893 (28.5%) patients were admitted to hospital for ≥ 7 days in the vaccination type, covid-19 type, and conventional myocarditis groups, respectively. Only 11 of 639 patients with non-conventional myocarditis had received a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine and had covid-19 disease within 28 days of admission to hospital for myocarditis.

### Associated factors and impact of myocarditis in patients with SLE from LUMINA, a multiethnic US cohort (LV) [^114hurrW]. Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the factors associated with myocarditis and its impact on disease outcomes in SLE patients.

Methods

SLE patients aged ≥ 16 yrs, disease duration ≤ 5 yrs from LUMINA (LUpus in Minorities: NAture vs nurture), a multiethnic US cohort, were studied. Myocarditis was defined as per the category 3 of the pericarditis/myocarditis item of the SLAM-Revised (SLAM-R). Patients with concurrent pericardial involvement were excluded. Patients with myocarditis were compared with those without myocarditis or its sequelae in the preceding year. The association between myocarditis and baseline variables (T(0)) was first examined. The impact of myocarditis on disease activity over time (SLAM-R), damage accrual [SLICC Damage Index (SDI)] at last visit (T(L)) and mortality was evaluated.

Results

Fifty-three of the 496 patients studied had myocarditis. African American ethnicity [Odds ratio (OR) = 12.6; 95% CI 1.6, 97.8] and SLAM-R at diagnosis (OR = 1.1, 95% CI 1.0, 1.1) were significantly and independently associated with myocarditis. Myocarditis did not predict disease activity over time, but approached significance as a predictor of SDI at T(L) in multivariable analyses P = 0.051. Kaplan-Meier curves indicated that myocarditis was associated with shorter survival (log-rank = 4.87, P = 0.02), particularly in patients with ≥ 5 yrs disease; however, myocarditis was not retained in the Cox proportional hazards regression model.

Conclusions

Ethnicity and disease activity at diagnosis were associated with the occurrence of myocarditis in SLE. Myocarditis did not significantly impact on disease activity over time, but impacts some on damage accrual and survival, reflecting overall the more severe disease those patients experience.
