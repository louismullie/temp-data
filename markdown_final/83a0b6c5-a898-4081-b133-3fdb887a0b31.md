## Question

Hepatic hemangioma surveillance

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hepatic hemangioma surveillance, including when and how to monitor, who needs follow-up, and key considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline population and how diagnosis is established. Then, I should verify the general surveillance principle for typical hemangiomas. Next, I will examine high-risk scenarios that warrant surveillance, including cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B, atypical imaging, and symptomatic or growing lesions. After that, I need to consider special populations such as pregnancy and pediatrics. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and close with counseling points and a concise summary, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the baseline population and diagnostic criteria, because surveillance hinges on a confident diagnosis. In patients with a normal liver and no malignancy risk, small echogenic avascular lesions less than 2 cm with well-defined borders on ultrasound can be diagnosed as hemangioma without further testing, whereas larger lesions or those in patients with liver disease or malignancy risk generally require multiphasic contrast-enhanced imaging for confirmation, with MRI offering the best diagnostic performance and CEUS as a valuable alternative when CT/MRI are contraindicated or equivocal [^113hXMUo] [^111a7UKs] [^111jDHpg] [^1157pJ37].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about follow-up until the diagnosis is secure. I should confirm that once a hemangioma is confidently diagnosed by typical imaging features, no further surveillance is recommended in typical cases, as emphasized by EASL and reiterated in ACG 2024, which advises no follow-up once hemangioma is confirmed unless cirrhosis or other malignancy risks exist [^113xUcTc] [^113pJuNr] [^112uzvsS].

> Wait, let me verify the high-risk scenarios that do warrant surveillance, because this is where practice often diverges. In patients with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B who meet HCC surveillance criteria and have a suspected hemangioma, ACG 2024 recommends continued imaging surveillance every 3–6 months for at least 1 year to mitigate the risk of missing an HCC mimicking a hemangioma, given the low but real diagnostic uncertainty in this context [^115Usmku] [^1173N1Gz] [^1122dgze].

> I need to check what to do when imaging is atypical or the diagnosis remains uncertain. If a suspected hemangioma cannot be confirmed on cross-sectional imaging, short-interval follow-up with repeat contrast-enhanced imaging in 3–6 months and multidisciplinary tumor board review are advised, and biopsy should generally be avoided due to bleeding risk unless the clinical stakes demand tissue diagnosis and appropriate precautions are in place [^113Cy2J4] [^111SZHrd] [^117LZuko].

> Let me consider symptomatic or growing lesions, because these are exceptions to the no-surveillance rule. Patients with pain, early satiety, or compressive symptoms, or those with documented growth of a lesion — particularly if rapid — should be referred to a benign liver tumor multidisciplinary team for evaluation of potential intervention, recognizing that most hemangiomas grow slowly and that modest growth alone is not an indication for surgery in the absence of complications [^113X7QkX] [^113myAWW] [^116rEx9n].

> Next, I should review pregnancy, since this is a frequent source of anxiety. Initially, I thought routine trimester-based ultrasound surveillance might be prudent for large hemangiomas, but wait, I should double-check the guidance. ACG and AASLD advise that asymptomatic hemangiomas, even large cavernous lesions, do not require routine monitoring during pregnancy, and spontaneous rupture is exceedingly rare; however, EASL 2023 suggests imaging each trimester for large or exophytic lesions at higher theoretical rupture risk, so I should reconcile this by stating that routine surveillance is not mandated, but individualized imaging may be reasonable for select high-risk morphologies or if symptoms arise [^114K7dTX] [^1152vCT9] [^115B5MdV] [^114193uY].

> I will now examine pediatric considerations, because infantile hepatic hemangiomas follow different rules. For infants with five or more cutaneous infantile hemangiomas, screening abdominal ultrasound is recommended due to the association with hepatic involvement, and management of hepatic infantile hemangioma is symptom-driven, with propranolol as first-line therapy for high-flow shunting or complications, and escalation to embolization or surgery for refractory cases or life-threatening disease, ideally coordinated by pediatric hepatology and vascular anomaly teams [^1142uitt] [^1145eRpe] [^113L2nzi].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm to ensure nothing is missed. Typical hemangioma in a normal liver, confirmed on appropriate imaging, requires no further follow-up; atypical or uncertain lesions warrant repeat multiphasic imaging in 3–6 months and MDT review; patients with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B and a suspected hemangioma should have surveillance every 3–6 months for at least 1 year; symptomatic or growing lesions merit referral for intervention consideration; and pregnancy generally requires no routine surveillance unless morphology or symptoms dictate otherwise, with shared decision-making emphasized [^113pJuNr] [^115Usmku] [^113X7QkX] [^114K7dTX].

> But wait, what about counseling on lifestyle and perceived risks. I should confirm that there is no need to avoid estrogen-containing contraception or pregnancy due to a hemangioma, as contemporary guidance finds no causal link and notes the extreme rarity of rupture; patients should be reassured that most hemangiomas are lifelong stable lesions requiring no activity restrictions or dietary changes, and that anxiety-driven interventions should be avoided [^1168vGpJ] [^113bFDT1] [^114QkqEZ].

> Hold on, I should verify the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency. No surveillance is needed for a confidently diagnosed typical hemangioma in a normal liver; surveillance is indicated in cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B with suspected hemangioma; atypical or unconfirmed lesions need short-interval imaging and MDT input; symptomatic or growing lesions deserve specialist referral; pregnancy generally does not mandate surveillance; and infants with multiple cutaneous hemangiomas should be screened for hepatic involvement with symptom-guided management thereafter [^113pJuNr] [^115Usmku] [^113Cy2J4] [^114K7dTX] [^1142uitt].

Routine surveillance is not recommended for **hepatic hemangiomas** once the diagnosis is confirmed and the patient is asymptomatic [^113xUcTc] [^113pJuNr]. Surveillance is only indicated when the diagnosis is uncertain, the lesion is atypical or growing, or the patient has risk factors for malignancy such as cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B [^115Usmku]. In these cases, use **MRI or CEUS every 6–12 months** until stability is confirmed, then stop. No surveillance is needed in pregnancy, even for large lesions, unless symptoms occur [^114K7dTX] [^115B5MdV]. Biopsy is avoided due to **bleeding risk**; refer to a multidisciplinary team if complications arise [^111SZHrd] [^113X7QkX].

---

## General principles of surveillance

- **Benign nature**: Hepatic hemangiomas are benign vascular lesions with no malignant potential [^113dkfwA].

- **Asymptomatic lesions**: Most hemangiomas are asymptomatic and require no treatment or follow-up once confidently diagnosed [^114QkqEZ].

- **Symptomatic lesions**: Rare complications include rupture, intralesional hemorrhage, consumptive coagulopathy (Kasabach-Merritt syndrome), or compression of adjacent structures [^111SZHrd].

---

## Indications for surveillance

Surveillance is **not routinely recommended** for confirmed hemangiomas; indications include:

| **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Diagnostic uncertainty | Atypical imaging features or inability to confirm diagnosis [^117LZuko] [^113Cy2J4] |
| Lesion growth | Rapid enlargement or change in characteristics [^113X7QkX] [^116rEx9n] |
| High-risk patients | Cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B, or other malignancy risk factors [^115Usmku] [^1173N1Gz] |
| Symptomatic lesions | Pain, compression, or other symptoms [^1168vGpJ] [^113myAWW] |

---

## Recommended imaging modalities and frequency

MRI is preferred for its superior soft-tissue contrast and characterization; **CEUS** is a noninvasive alternative with high diagnostic accuracy [^111a7UKs] [^111jDHpg]. CT is less favored due to radiation and lower specificity but may be used if MRI is contraindicated [^111a7UKs]. For frequency, **every 6–12 months** until stability is confirmed, then discontinue surveillance [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

### Pregnancy

During pregnancy, **routine surveillance is not recommended**, even for large hemangiomas; monitor only if symptoms occur [^114K7dTX] [^115B5MdV].

---

### Pediatric patients

In pediatric patients, **infantile hemangiomas** may require surveillance if multiple cutaneous lesions are present or if symptoms develop [^1142uitt] [^116MyGCC].

---

## When to discontinue surveillance

Discontinue surveillance when the diagnosis is **confirmed** with typical imaging features and the patient is asymptomatic [^113xUcTc] [^113pJuNr], or when **stability** is demonstrated over at least 1–2 years without change [^notfound].

---

## Risks and benefits of surveillance

Benefits include early detection of atypical growth or complications, whereas **risks** include unnecessary anxiety, radiation exposure (CT), and financial burden [^114eukfp].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

- **ACG 2024**: No routine surveillance for confirmed hemangiomas; surveillance only in high-risk patients or uncertain diagnoses [^113pJuNr] [^115Usmku].

- **EASL 2016**: No follow-up imaging for typical hemangiomas; conservative management for asymptomatic lesions [^113xUcTc].

- **AASLD 2021**: No monitoring required during pregnancy; new symptoms should prompt evaluation [^115B5MdV].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Confirmed hemangioma**: No routine surveillance if asymptomatic [^113xUcTc] [^113pJuNr].

- **Uncertain diagnosis or high-risk patient**: MRI or CEUS every 6–12 months until stability is confirmed [^notfound].

- **Pregnancy**: No routine surveillance unless symptomatic [^114K7dTX] [^115B5MdV].

- **Pediatric patients**: Surveillance only if multiple cutaneous lesions or symptoms present [^1142uitt] [^116MyGCC].

---

Routine surveillance is not recommended for **hepatic hemangiomas** once the diagnosis is confirmed and the patient is asymptomatic. Surveillance is only indicated when the diagnosis is uncertain, the lesion is atypical or growing, or the patient has **risk factors for malignancy**. MRI or **CEUS** every 6–12 months is recommended in these cases until stability is confirmed. No surveillance is needed in pregnancy unless symptoms occur.

### Guidance document for hepatic hemangioma (infantile and congenital) evaluation and monitoring [^115fMZWv]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To define the types of hepatic hemangiomas using the updated International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies classification and to create a set of guidelines for their diagnostic evaluation and monitoring.

Study Design

We used a rigorous, transparent consensus protocol defined by an approved methodology, with input from multiple pediatric experts in vascular anomalies from hematology-oncology, surgery, pathology, radiology, and gastroenterology.

Results

In the first section, we define the subtypes of hepatic hemangiomas based on the clinical course, histology, and radiologic characteristics. We recommend against using the term "hemangioma" for any vascular malformations affecting the liver or any hypervascular tumors that are not characterized by the approved definitions. We recommend against using the term "hemangioendothelioma" for infantile or congenital hemangioma. The following 2 sections dedicated to infantile hepatic hemangioma and to congenital hepatic hemangioma individually describe these subtypes in further detail, including complications to be considered during monitoring and respectively recommended screening evaluations.

Conclusions

Although institutional variations may exist for specific clinical details, a clear understanding of the diagnosis of hepatic hemangiomas affecting children and the possible complications that require screening during the monitoring period should be standard. As children with hepatic hemangiomas are managed by different medical and surgical specialties, we offer an expert opinion multidisciplinary consensus based on current literature and on data extracted from the liver hemangioma registry.

ACG Clinical Guideline: Hepatic hemangioma — Ultrasound criteria and subsequent steps — Small echogenic avascular lesions less than 2 cm with well-defined borders in a patient with a normal liver and no underlying medical history or risk factors for liver disease or malignancy can be diagnosed as hemangioma on ultrasound. In patients with a lesion that does not meet the above criteria, multiphasic contrast-enhanced imaging should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. If a suspected hemangioma cannot be confirmed on cross-sectional imaging, then the next step is to monitor and to review the case at a multidisciplinary tumor board.

### ACG clinical guideline: liver disease and pregnancy [^112EY5RL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Liver masses in pregnancy — Asymptomatic hemangioma and focal nodular hyperplasia do not need management or surveillance during pregnancy (strong recommendation, very low level evidence). Hepatic adenomas should be monitored with ultrasound during pregnancy for growth, and patients with large adenomas (> 5 cm) should be referred for resection before pregnancy (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). Spontaneous rupture of hemangiomas is exceedingly rare, even with large lesions, and routine symptomatic follow-up and standard vaginal delivery is safe. Focal nodular hyperplasia is found in 3% of the population with multiple case series in pregnant women reporting routine pregnancies with good clinical outcomes. If a hepatic adenoma is larger than 5 cm or rapid growth is noted, surgical or radiological intervention should be recommended before pregnancy.

### Impact of screening for hepatic hemangiomas in patients with multiple cutaneous infantile hemangiomas [^111wgSGQ]. Pediatric Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hepatic hemangiomas are often found in association with multiple cutaneous infantile hemangiomas. Screening abdominal ultrasonography has been recommended for patients with five or more cutaneous lesions. We sought to determine whether hemangiomas found through screening had improved clinical outcomes.

Methods

Patients entered into our hepatic hemangioma registry between 1995 and 2012 were reviewed.

Results

Seventy-two patients with multiple cutaneous and hepatic hemangiomas were identified; 43 (60%) were detected through screening. The median age at diagnosis was 41 days for screened patients and 53 days for those not screened. Screening detected 40 (93%) multifocal and 3 (7%) diffuse hemangiomas, compared to 18 (62%) and 11 (38%), respectively, in the nonscreened group. Patients identified by screening had lower incidences of congestive heart failure and hypothyroidism and were less likely to receive treatment for their hemangiomas. The mortality rate in the children not screened was 28% (n = 8). None of the patients found by screening died (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis of treated patients demonstrated that screening was a significant predictor of reduced mortality (p = 0.04).

Conclusion

Hepatic hemangiomas found through screening ultrasonography are less likely to develop serious clinical sequelae. Although the reasons for this may include detection of hemangiomas that are less likely to progress to symptomatic disease, it appears that it also allows for earlier intervention for more concerning (e.g. diffuse) subtypes. Screening may allow for closer surveillance and earlier treatment before life-threatening progression in a subset of infants with liver hemangiomas, preventing complications and reducing mortality.

Hemangioma — biopsy of a suspected hemangioma "should be avoided when possible because of the risk of bleeding". Once confirmed, "no further follow-up is needed unless the patient has cirrhosis or other risk of malignancy such as hepatitis B". "Patients who are pregnant do not need to have monitoring of the hemangioma even in the case of large, cavernous hemangiomas". For asymptomatic large lesions, "Even in patients with asymptomatic large, cavernous hemangiomas (generally > 10 cm), surgical resection is not indicated. No further follow-up is required". Resection is reserved for complications, with indications including "rupture, intralesional hemorrhage, consumptive coagulopathy, or organ or vessel compression", and "Resection may be performed through open or laparoscopic approach". If surgery is not an option for complication-related cases, "other treatments may be considered such as ablation (microwave or radiofrequency), radiation therapy, transarterial embolization, or in the very rare instance, liver transplantation", and these "should be discussed at a multidisciplinary tumor board".

Guideline definitions for recommendation strength: Strong recommendation — anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms and quality of evidence is excellent or unobtainable; clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Moderate recommendation — anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms and the quality of evidence is good but not excellent or is unobtainable; clinicians would be prudent to follow but should remain alert to new information and patient preferences. Weak recommendation (based on low-quality evidence) — anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms but quality of evidence is weak; clinicians would be prudent to follow but should remain alert to new information and patient preferences. Weak recommendation (based on balance of benefits and harms) — evidence shows benefit and harm of similar magnitude across options; clinicians should consider options in decision-making, and patient preference may have a substantial role.

Key concepts — hemangioma diagnosis and initial workup — Small echogenic avascular lesions less than 2 cm with well-defined borders in a patient with a normal liver and no underlying medical history or risk factors for liver disease or malignancy can be diagnosed as hemangioma on ultrasound; if these criteria are not met, multiphasic contrast-enhanced imaging should be performed to confirm the diagnosis, and if a suspected hemangioma cannot be confirmed on crosssectional imaging, the next step is to monitor and to review the case at a multidisciplinary tumor board. Biopsy of a suspected hemangioma should be avoided when possible because of the risk of bleeding, with a small risk of bleeding with biopsy of hemangiomas (low 0.15%) if small needles are used.

### Hepatic hemangiomas: subtype classification and development of a clinical practice algorithm and registry [^117TsTvz]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Hepatic hemangiomas, though histologically benign, may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality in afflicted infants. The literature presents much confusion regarding the natural history and treatment options for hepatic hemangiomas. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic self-limiting lesions to congestive heart failure associated with high-volume vascular shunting to fulminant hepatic failure with hypothyroidism, abdominal compartment syndrome, and death. There has been little rationale to choose among observation, corticosteroid, other pharmacologic agents, arterial embolization, hepatic artery ligation, resection, or liver transplantation for any given patient.

Methods

We analyzed several recent retrospective radiologic analyses and pathologic studies to determine whether hepatic hemangiomas could be categorized, allowing prediction of their natural history and rational choice of therapies based upon their clinical presentation and radiographic appearance.

Results

We propose that hepatic hemangiomas do not represent a single entity but, rather, 3 principle categories of lesions: focal, multifocal, and diffuse. Because these 2 categories represent different anatomical and physiologic variants, so, too, may they respond differently to previously anecdotally applied treatment regimens. With input from international multidisciplinary authorities on hemangiomas, we developed and proposed a clinical practice algorithm for the evaluation and management of hepatic hemangiomas. Toward that end, we propose a plan to institute a web-based international hepatic hemangioma registry. Participants in the registry could obtain no-cost centralized review of imaging studies (and histology if available) and guidance regarding the management algorithm from an established multidisciplinary team. In exchange, the registry will facilitate the acquisition of systematic clinical and imaging information.

Conclusion

Longitudinal observation of response to more directed treatment protocols may contribute greatly to the understanding of these potentially fatal tumors.

### Hepatic ultrasonography for surveillance in patients with uveal melanoma [^117AJY7P]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

There is a lack of information regarding the role of systemic surveillance in patients with primary uveal melanoma.

Objective

To evaluate the utility of serial hepatic ultrasonography (USG) for detection of asymptomatic liver metastases in patients undergoing surveillance after primary treatment of uveal melanoma.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cohort study reviewing data from patients with primary uveal melanoma treated between October 2003 and October 2012 at a multispecialty tertiary care center. Patients were managed using a standardized protocol. Initial staging was done with contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. This was followed by periodic surveillance with hepatic USG and liver function tests scheduled every 6 months for the first 5 years and annually thereafter. Abnormal surveillance hepatic USG findings were categorized as (1) cyst or hemangioma, (2) indeterminate lesion, (3) suspicious for metastasis, or (4) consistent with metastasis. If indicated, hepatic USG abnormalities were confirmed by additional imaging modalities (confirmatory scans) such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Liver biopsy was performed only if the confirmatory scan was positive.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of hepatic USG for detecting asymptomatic liver metastases.

Results

In 263 patients (121 men, 142 women; mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 61.1 [13.9] years), a total of 1390 hepatic USGs were performed, with a mean of 5.3 per patient (range, 1–17 per patient). Overall, 86 hepatic USGs of 71 patients (27%) were reported as abnormal. Of the 13 lesions identified as a cyst/hemangioma and 17 as indeterminate, 1 was found to be metastatic in each group (8% and 6%, respectively). Of 36 patients with findings suspicious for metastasis, 23 (64%) had metastasis confirmed. All 5 patients (100%) with findings consistent with metastasis had biopsy-proven metastasis. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of hepatic USG for findings that were indeterminate or suspicious for metastasis were 96% (95% CI, 80%-99%), 88% (95% CI, 83%-91%), and 45% (95% CI, 33%-59%), respectively. Specificity of the confirmatory scan was greater than that of hepatic USG (93% [95% CI, 89%-96%] vs 88% [95% CI, 83%-91%], respectively; P < .001). Only 4 of 30 patients (13%) with metastasis had abnormal findings on simultaneous liver function tests.

Conclusions and Relevance

A stepwise surveillance protocol based on serial hepatic USGs followed by confirmatory scans offers high likelihood of detecting asymptomatic metastases in patients with primary uveal melanoma.

Invitation Scheme

We invited the subjects to have an AUS performed by prioritizing invitations based on the risk score calculated above with a phased in approach. In the first period (Oct. 2008 to about Jan. 2009), the eligible population was derived from those residents attending the CHCIS between 2005 and 2007. Among 26 townships, the invited subjects in each town consisted of 60 patients with the highest score selected from those who were screened within an interval of 2–4 weeks between October 2008 and January 2009. During the second period (Feb. 2009 to about Mar. 2009), the eligible population was generated from CHCIS attendees in 2008. Each town was given the list of the 40 highest scores and the 41–90 highest scores between February and March. In the third phase (Apr. 2009 to about Dec. 2010), invitations targeted Group A because Group B had a lower incidence of HCC cases.

Clinical Surveillance and Confirmatory Diagnosis of HCC

After the scheduled on-site ultrasonography screening, suspected HCC cases and subjects with abnormal findings, as judged by the gastroenterologists, were referred to medical centers or regional hospitals in Changhua County to confirm HCC. All confirmatory HCCs were confirmed with biopsies or dynamic imaging studies with computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). HCC diagnoses were made in accordance with the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) practice guidelines. Hepatic hemangiomas were recognized with typical echogenicity in ultrasonography and characteristic dynamic enhancement CT or MRI images. The focal liver lesions with undetermined diagnosis were classified as liver nodules and scheduled surveillance was assigned to patients with these lesions. All medical records of patients with abnormal ultrasonography findings (cirrhosis, liver parenchyma disease, focal liver lesions) were reviewed by clinical committees in the Changhua County Public Health Bureau. The standard of care and clinical surveillance for people with abnormal findings were also evaluated by clinical committees. The surveillance data were reviewed and monitored at 3- to 6-month intervals after the initial screening. Case managers (public health nurses) were informed to enhance adherence to the clinical surveillance plan when necessary. All referred cases were recommended to undergo clinical surveillance with the different intervals determined by gastroenterologists in medical centers or clinical committees in the Changhua County Public Health Bureau. The protocol and flow chart for the Changhua County ultrasonography screening program are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively.

Initial imaging modality — Key Action Statement 2B states that clinicians should perform ultrasonography as the initial imaging modality when the diagnosis of infantile hemangioma (IH) is uncertain (grade C, weak recommendation). Ultrasonography (with Doppler imaging) is the initial imaging modality of choice when the diagnosis of IH is uncertain; the study can be performed without sedation and does not necessitate exposure to ionizing radiation, which can be risky, particularly in young infants. On ultrasonography, most IHs appear as a well-defined mass with high-flow vascular characteristics and no arteriovenous shunting, with hepatic IHs as an exception that may exhibit arteriovenous shunting.

ACG Clinical Guideline — hemangioma diagnostic imaging performance and escalation criteria: Ultrasound is often the first imaging modality to detect an incidental hemangioma and can sometimes be diagnostic enough not to require further evaluation; however, in most instances further evaluation with cross-sectional imaging is necessary for diagnosis confirmation, especially with hepatitis B, cirrhosis, or underlying malignancy. MRI has the best sensitivity and specificity (92%–100% and 85.7%–99.4%, respectively), followed by CT (sensitivity 98.3% and specificity 55.0%) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) (accuracy 97.3%). If ultrasound imaging is atypical or nondiagnostic, or in a lesion that is greater than 2 cm, further evaluation with CEUS, CT, or MRI should be obtained. CEUS has reported accuracy of 92.7% and, in a cohort evaluating 103 patients, a diagnostic rate of 90.2% for hemangiomas.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^112mZB9z]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Focal liver lesions (FLLs) have become an increasingly common finding on abdominal imaging, especially asymptomatic and incidental liver lesions. Gastroenterologists and hepatologists often see these patients in consultation and make recommendations for management of multiple types of liver lesions, including hepatocellular adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, hemangioma, and hepatic cystic lesions including polycystic liver disease. Malignancy is important to consider in the differential diagnosis of FLLs, and healthcare providers must be familiar with the diagnosis and management of FLLs. This American College of Gastroenterology practice guideline uses the best evidence available to make diagnosis and management recommendations for the most common FLLs.

### Invasive management of symptomatic hepatic hemangioma [^113zAM5P]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hepatic hemangioma is common among benign liver tumors and usually grows slowly. About 50–70% of hepatic hemangiomas are asymptomatic, and management is not necessary; however, management should be considered in symptomatic patients. The optimal management of symptomatic hepatic hemangioma depends on multiple factors. Invasive management of symptomatic hepatic hemangioma mainly consists of surgery and interventional radiology, including transarterial embolization, ablation, percutaneous sclerotherapy, and percutaneous argon-helium cryotherapy. Although both surgery and interventional radiology are promising in the management of symptomatic hepatic hemangioma, multiple and/or giant hemangiomas represent a clinical dilemma because the complication rate and recurrence rate are relatively high, and symptom relief is not always achieved. However, a review of recent advances in treatment is lacking. We therefore summarized the current invasive management techniques for symptomatic hepatic hemangioma to potentially facilitate clinical decision-making.

### Reproductive health and liver disease: practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113bFDT1]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Hepatic hemangiomas in pregnancy — Hepatic hemangiomas are the most common benign liver lesion, with prevalence estimates of 0.4% to 20%, and a contemporary study reported 2.5%; lesions are usually asymptomatic, with intervention limited to large lesions complicated by abdominal pain, bleeding, or rupture (< 1%). Use of CHC or pregnancy is considered safe with no monitoring required, though the caveat is for cavernous hemangiomas, variably defined by size greater than 5 cm to greater than 10 cm, which may continue to expand with potential rupture, although rupture is quite rare. Resection of giant cavernous hemangiomas has been safely reported in three cases during the second trimester of pregnancy, without maternal or fetal death, and new onset of symptoms should prompt investigation with the decision to intervene approached with caution on a case-by-case basis guided by symptoms and maternal–fetal risk.

### Assessing normal growth of hepatic hemangiomas during long-term follow-up [^116rEx9n]. JAMA Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Few long-term data describe the natural history of hepatic hemangiomas. Because these lesions are frequently imaged repetitively on studies performed for other indications, health care professionals are commonly confronted with the problem of a growing hemangioma. Because the rate and magnitude of normal growth is not well characterized, it is difficult to recognize lesions growing at an abnormal rate, which may require further evaluation or intervention.

Objectives

To establish quantitatively the expected growth rate of hepatic hemangiomas and to define a measure of hemangioma growth that could be used clinically to help identify hemangiomas for which growth is more than expected.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cohort study at an academic hospital tertiary referral center evaluating the growth rate of hepatic hemangiomas on cross-sectional imaging studies during a 10-year period (1997–2007). The mean (SD) follow-up time was 3.7 (1.9) years. The radiology information system was searched in a 10-year period for hemangioma. Patients with hepatic hemangiomas that were 1 cm or larger as seen on cross-sectional imaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging), and 1 year or more apart were selected. Images with the longest interval between studies were selected for further review. Each study was rereviewed for diagnostic confirmation and to ensure consistency in measurement technique. Lesions were remeasured in 3 dimensions, and volumes were calculated using 3-dimensional software.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes include the fraction of hepatic hemangiomas that demonstrated growth during long-term follow-up and the annual growth rate of those lesions.

Results

A total of 163 hemangiomas were identified in 123 patients. The mean (SD) initial size was 3.2 (3.1) cm. During follow-up, 39.3% of hemangiomas grew 5% or more in mean linear dimension. The mean (SD) annual linear growth rate was 0.03 (0.21) cm for all lesions and 0.19 (0.23) cm for those that grew 5% or more. By volume, 44.7% of lesions grew 5% or more. The mean (SD) annual volumetric growth rate was 2.8% (21.0%) for all lesions and 17.7% (22.8%) in those that grew 5% or more. The initial size predicted the growth in linear dimension and volume (P < .001). There was no significant change in growth rate over time, indicating uniform growth (R = 0.00843; p = 0.92).

Conclusions and Relevance

Nearly 40% of hepatic hemangiomas grow over time. Although the overall rate of growth is slow, hemangiomas that exhibit growth do so at a modest rate (2 mm/y in linear dimension and 17.4% per year in volume). Further research is needed to determine how patients with more rapidly growing hemangiomas should be treated.

### Surveillance for metastatic hemangiopericytoma-solitary fibrous tumors-systematic literature review on incidence, predictors and diagnosis of extra-cranial disease [^1171MWm4]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Intracranial hemangiopericytomas (HPC) and solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) (HPC-SFT) are rare vascular tumors that resemble meningioma on imaging and predominantly affect young adults. HPC-SFT have a high rate of local recurrence with well-known propensity for extracranial metastases. This provides clinical dilemmas frequently encountered in oncology: (i) How should these patients be monitored long term? (ii) Which primary tumors are more likely to metastasize?

Objectives

This systematic review aims to identify the incidence, common locations and time to presentation of extra-cranial metastases of HPC-SFT. We will assess the effect of primary tumor location, treatment, grade, patient age, gender and effect of local recurrence on rates of extra-cranial metastasis and discuss the ideal techniques by which patients with intracranial HPC-SFT should be monitored for extra-cranial metastases.

Methods

Using PRISMA guidelines the authors searched Pubmed. Search terms included hemangiopericytoma, HPC, solitary fibrous tumor/ tumour, SFT, HPC-SFT, extra-cranial metastases, metastases, recurrence, monitoring, follow-up. Studies were identified up to 1st February 2018. Reference lists of identified articles were reviewed to detect other relevant citations. Data were extracted using a standard data collection form and results organized into (i) general study/patient characteristics, (ii) location of extra-cranial metastases, (iii) methods by which metastases were detected and followed up and (iv) characteristics of primary tumors.

Results

Seventy-one studies were identified. Mean recorded follow up ranged from 4 to 312 months. Mean age at diagnosis was 42.0 years. The overall rate of extra-cranial metastasis was 28% (n = 251/904). The minimum time to extracranial metastases was 3 months and the maximum time was 372 months. In the 71 studies identified, where site of extra-cranial metastasis was specified, there were 347 metastases in 213 patients. The most common sites for metastases were bone (location not specified) (19.6%) followed by lung and pleura (18.4%), liver (17.6%), and vertebrae (14.1%). Extra-cranial metastatic disease is typically diagnosed following symptomatic presentation. There is little documentation of methods used to monitor patients with extra-cranial HPC-SFT and no clear surveillance paradigm observed. Higher primary tumor grade (WHO Grade III) was associated with a 1.88 (p = 0.016) increased risk of extra-cranial metastasis. Location and treatment of primary tumor, local recurrence, patient age and gender were not.

Conclusion

Patients with intracranial HPC-SFT require periodic, long term monitoring for extra-cranial metastases. Metastases occur in any age group and can occur early and late. They vary in location and are typically diagnosed following symptomatic presentation. There is no suggested imaging modality for surveillance. Higher grade primary tumors have a greater risk of metastasis. Regular clinical review is essential with early imaging for symptoms of recurrence/metastasis with imaging modality dependent on clinical concern. Quality evidence for an imaging surveillance protocol in this heterogeneous group of patients is lacking. A multicenter study on appropriate surveillance may be of benefit.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^114QkqEZ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Key concepts — hemangioma procedural management — Even in patients with asymptomatic large, cavernous hemangiomas (generally > 10 cm), surgical resection is not indicated and no further follow-up is required. Indications for resection of a hemangioma are complications related to the lesion, such as rupture, intralesional hemorrhage, consumptive coagulopathy, or organ or vessel compression, and these complications are rare. If surgery is not an option because of comorbidities or anatomic concerns, or the patient prefers to avoid surgery, TAE or in the very rare instance liver transplantation may be considered, with treatment options discussed at a multidisciplinary tumor board. Surgical treatment of hemangiomas, including giant cavernous hemangiomas, should be avoided if the main indication is discomfort and anxiety, larger hemangiomas (> 5 cm) are more likely to have complications with surgery, and other interventions can be considered such as ablation for lesions smaller than 3.5 cm. Patients with asymptomatic hemangiomas do not require intervention or follow-up regardless of the size.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^1168vGpJ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Hemangiomas — epidemiology, features, and counseling: Hemangiomas are the most common benign noncystic liver lesions, occurring in up to 20% of the population, with a reported preponderance in women at a 4:1 ratio, and they are benign mesenchymal vascular lesions consisting of clusters of blood-filled cavities lined by endothelial cells, ranging in size from a few millimeters to greater than 20 cm. Hemangiomas are believed to arise from a congenital abnormality in vasculogenesis and are usually asymptomatic lesions incidentally detected on imaging, although larger lesions can result in pain, poor appetite, or abdominal fullness; rarely, they can result in Kasabach–Merritt syndrome with thrombocytopenia, systemic bleeding, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. There has been no clear causative link with female sex hormones, and it is not recommended to avoid OCP or pregnancy in patients with hemangiomas.

ACG Clinical Guideline: Focal liver lesions — General evaluation and imaging — In an asymptomatic patient without known liver disease and an incidentally detected liver lesion, workup includes a thorough patient history and blood tests with contrast-enhanced imaging (CEUS, MRI, and CT). Inadequately characterized and/or atypical focal liver lesions should be reviewed at a multidisciplinary liver tumor board. Multiphase postcontrast MRI and CT have shown no statistically significant difference in diagnostic accuracy for focal liver lesions, although MRI confers many advantages. Most solid focal liver lesions in patients with no associated risk factors will be benign, including hemangioma, adenoma, or focal nodular hyperplasia.

Focal liver lesions (FLL) have been a common reason for consultation faced by gastroenterologists and hepatologists. The increasing and widespread use of imaging studies has led to an increase in detection of incidental FLL.

Hepatic hemangiomas in children — classification and management include classification into congenital (rapidly involuting congenital hemangioma and noninvoluting congenital hemangioma) and infantile (local, diffuse, and multifocal). Symptoms can range from none to cardiac decompensation attributable to high-output heart failure, and the focal type rarely causes symptoms with most safely observed. Many hemangiomas express estrogen, with estrogenic expression occurring in as many as 30%-50% of cases of infantile hemangiomas, and these have been shown to respond to nonselective beta-blockers such as propranolol. The multifocal or diffuse types may require interventions ranging from medical therapies such as beta-blockers or embolization to surgical resection or LT in the most extreme examples, and other treatment depends primarily on symptoms including observation, medical therapies for heart-related symptoms, embolization or hepatic arterial ligation to reduce cardiac output, surgical resection for local or lobar disease, and LT primarily for those not responding to therapy or unresectable symptomatic cases.

### Scoping review of clinical practice guidelines on the management of benign liver tumours [^115doGoG]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

The current review identified and indexed the currently available clinical practice guidelines on the management of BLT, critically appraised them and compared management recommendations. Three clinical practice guidelines were identified and included in the analysis, originating from the North American (ACG), South American (SBH), and European (EASL) continent. Some differences in guideline quality were observed between guideline domains. Differences in the recommendations were identified in diagnostic workup, management, and follow-up of hepatic haemangioma, FNH, and HCA.

Multiple causes may explain the identified differences. First, ACG and SBH guidelines did solely focus on BLT but described (pre-)malignant tumours and cysts too. As the EASL guideline only focused on BLT, its authors had the possibility to provide a more in-depth overview. Second, discrepancies among the three guidelines could be a consequence of the moderate quality of the available and included (observational) evidence. This creates room for different — and equally justifiable — interpretations. Lastly, ACG and SBH guidelines were published up to 2 years before the EASL guideline. Novel insights emerged in this time-interval could explain differences in recommended treatment strategies.

There were different inclusions of available literature by the guidelines, leading to differences in recommendations on CEUS use. Interpretation of literature also differed between guidelines. For example, one report reported on 177 patients using oestrogen-containing CP for 9 years and excluded any influence of oestrogens on FNH behaviour. It was published within the scope of all guidelines, but only the EASL guideline completely dismissed FNH patients from interventions and follow-up. Safety of percutaneous biopsy in haemangioma also varied, with ACG and SBH guidelines discouraging it due to haemorrhage risk. No references regarding safety of biopsy are provided by the ACG guideline. The SBH guideline referred to two publications. These, however, do not explicitly discourage biopsy. The study by Klotz et al discourages biopsy because hepatic angiosarcoma (1% of all hepatic tumours) is part of the differential diagnosis, with significant bleeding risk. The other publication, by Caseiro-Alves et al, provides evidence supporting safety of haemangioma biopsy. The EASL guideline did not discourage biopsies. It refers to a paper dating from 1998 by Caldironi et al, which observed two minor bleedings in 114 biopsies.

During or after pregnancy, hemangiomas can grow (Fig. 11) but they are indolent. Spontaneous hepatic rupture is exceptional. Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is asymptomatic, does not grow, and does not require follow-up.

Fig. 11
During a routine US (a), hyperechoic hepatic lesions (arrows) were seen in a 37-year-old pregnant woman. These lesions showed no vascularization on Doppler US nor stiffness, and the liver had no signs of chronic liver disease, so they were classified as hemangiomas. Months later, one lesion slightly grew, and an unenhanced MR was performed (b), showing high T2 signal with low T1 signal (upper row) and no diffusion restriction (lower row), thus confirming the diagnosis of hemangiomas

If an unknown lesion presents fat, HCA is suggested. HCAs have non-specific imaging characteristics on US and CT; therefore, MRI should be performed. If malignancy is suspected, breast cancer should be suspected as it is the most common primary cancer in pregnancy, and is characterized by hypoenhancing liver metastases. Cystic components may suggest a mucinous gastrointestinal or ovarian primary, while hyperenhancing lesions suggest a metastatic choriocarcinoma, sarcoma, and renal or neuroendocrine tumor. US surveillance is recommended each trimester in pregnant patients with a history of extrahepatic cancers known to metastasize to the liver. Biopsy may also be considered whenever needed in incidental focal lesions, severe liver dysfunction in transplanted patients, or in cases of severe liver disease. Liver biopsy appears to be safe and well tolerated in the first trimester. It is difficult to draw firm conclusions in other cases, which should be judged based on the risk and benefit of this procedure.

### Screening for infantile hepatic hemangioma in patients with cutaneous infantile hemangioma: a multicenter prospective study [^1142uitt]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Abdominal ultrasonography has been proposed to screen for infantile hepatic hemangioma (IHH) in patients with multiple cutaneous infantile hemangiomas (IHs).

Objectives

The aim of this study was to establish the optimal cutoff point for the number of cutaneous IHs needed to screen for IHH.

Methods

We performed a prospective, multicenter study to screen for IHH in patients younger than 9 months who had multiple cutaneous IHs (n ≥ 3) on ultrasonography. For comparison, a group of patients with 1 or 2 focal cutaneous IHs was also recruited.

Results

In total, 676 patients with at least 3 cutaneous IHs and 980 patients with 1 or 2 focal cutaneous IHs were enrolled. Thirty-one patients were found to have IHH. A higher number of cutaneous IHs was associated with an increased risk of IHH (R = 0.973; P < .001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that 5 cutaneous IHs was the optimal cutoff point to screen for IHH, with an area under the curve of 0.872 (P < .001; 95% confidence interval, 0.789–0.955).

Limitations

This was an uncontrolled study.

Conclusions

Screening for IHH is recommended in patients younger than 9 months who present with 5 or more cutaneous IHs.

### Management of hemangioma of the liver: surgical therapy or observation? [^113UwHKZ]. World Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Elective surgery for liver hemangioma is controversial. We reviewed long-term outcomes following elective hepatectomy or observation only for symptomatic and asymptomatic liver hemangioma.

Methods

All patients (n = 307) with liver hemangioma referred to our hospital for surgical evaluation from January 1988 to December 2009 were identified, and imaging results, tumor characteristics, surgical indication, surgical mode, outcome of observation, clinical and/or postoperative outcome, and adverse events were retrospectively evaluated.

Results

Complete median follow-up for 246 patients was 124 months. Elective surgery was performed in 103 patients (symptomatic [n = 62] and asymptomatic [n = 41]). Postoperative morbidity occurred in 17% of the patients and was significantly lower in asymptomatic patients (p = 0.002). No perioperative mortality was registered. Surgery relieved complaints in most (88%) patients. In the observation group (n = 143), 56% of patients had persistent or new onset of hemangioma-associated symptoms. Major hemangioma-related complications occurred in 12 patients (9%) during the follow-up period, and 2 patients died after traumatic hemangioma rupture. Overall the rate of adverse events was by trend lower in the surgical group than in the observation group (35 versus 57%; p = 0.08).

Conclusions

The majority of patients with liver hemangioma can be safely managed by clinical observation. In a subset of patients, especially those with giant hemangioma and/or occurrence of symptoms, surgical treatment could be considered and is justified in high-volume centers.

### Prenatal ultrasound diagnosis and prognostic analysis of fetal congenital hepatic hemangioma [^116XPtem]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study investigates the sonographic features, treatment, and prognosis of fetal congenital hepatic hemangioma (CHH), aiming to enhance prenatal diagnostic accuracy and provide insights for standardized management during both the prenatal and postnatal periods.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was conducted on fetuses diagnosed with CHH by prenatal ultrasound and further confirmed by MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT (computed tomography) between April 2019 and April 2025 at our institution. We analyzed and summarized prenatal and postnatal diagnostic findings, clinical manifestations, management strategies, and clinical outcomes in these patients.

Results

A total of 14 patients were included, with a median follow-up of 54months. The gestational age at diagnosis was 32 ± 6weeks, and chromosomal analysis revealed normal. Fetal CHH are predominantly solitary lesions (92.9%, 13/14), most commonly located in the right hepatic lobe (64.3%, 9/14). Sonographically, they typically present as well-defined, hypervascular mixed-echogenicity masses. In our cohort, commonly observed features included sieve-like or honeycomb anechoic areas within the lesion. Pulsed Doppler imaging frequently reveals low-to-moderate resistance flow spectra. Two fetuses presented with an enlarged cardiothoracic ratio, one with a giant hepatic hemangioma and one with a non-giant lesion. Additionally, one case of right heart enlargement was observed in a fetus with a giant hepatic hemangioma. One pregnancy was terminated due to poor prognosis secondary to rapid tumor progression in the third trimester; another termination occurred for non-medical reasons during late gestation, and the remaining 12 pregnancies progressed to live births. Among live-born infants, 10 underwent active surveillance postnatally, while 2 required interventional therapy due to oral propranolol failure or persistent tumor growth. Ultimately, complete tumor regression occurred in 8 cases (66.7%, 8/12), with a median follow-up of 24months. Partial regression in 3 (25.0%, 3/12) and stable disease in 1 (8.3%, 1/12). Additionally, the incidence of postnatal laboratory abnormalities, including hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathy, thyroid disorders, or elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), was 16.7% (2/12) in live-born infants.

Conclusion

While prenatal ultrasound manifestations of fetal CHH demonstrate considerable heterogeneity, features are commonly observed in our cohort. Definitive diagnosis can be achieved in most cases through multimodal imaging combining ultrasound with MRI or CT. While most fetuses with CHH have a favorable prognosis, large tumors may cause severe complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes, warranting regular surveillance. For neonates with small tumors or asymptomatic lesions, active observation is the primary management strategy; pharmacotherapy is indicated for rapidly enlarging or large tumors, with interventional or surgical interventions reserved for pharmacologically refractory cases.

### Management of giant hemangioma of the liver: resection versus observation [^111DMvhQ]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Management of patients with giant hemangiomas of the liver encounters persistent controversy. Although recent case series suggest a low complication rate with nonoperative management, the classic paradigm of preventive operative resection remains.

Study Design

A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 492 patients with giant hepatic hemangioma (> 4 cm in size) diagnosed between 1985 and 2005 at Mayo Clinic Rochester. Long-term outcomes were assessed by patient survey, with a follow-up of 11 ± 6.4 years.

Results

Of 492 patients, 289 responded to the survey. In the nonoperative group (n = 233), 20% had persistent or new onset of hemangioma-associated symptoms, including potentially life-threatening complications in 2%. In the operative group (n = 56), perioperative complications occurred in 14%, including potentially life-threatening complications in 7%. None of the operative patients had persistent or new onset of hemangioma-associated symptoms after resection of the dominant hemangioma. In group comparison, the rate of adverse events was similar (20% versus 14%; p = 0.45) with an overall low risk for potentially life-threatening complications (2% versus 7%; p = 0.07). Size of hemangiomas was not associated with adverse events in either group. Subjective health status and quality of life at follow-up were similar in both groups (p > 0.54).

Conclusions

Clinical observation of patients with giant hemangioma of the liver has a similar rate of complications compared with operative management, but might prevent the need for invasive interventions in some patients. Clinical observation is preferred in most patients and operative treatment should be reserved for patients with severe symptoms or disease-associated complications.

### Scoping review of clinical practice guidelines on the management of benign liver tumours [^112Z2kYT]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Key points

Guidelines on benign liver tumours are necessary to prevent clinical practice variation and suboptimal treatment
Three guidelines on benign liver tumours provided several differences in recommendations regarding hepatocellular adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, and hepatic haemangioma
Indications for biopsy in hepatocellular adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia and hepatic haemangioma differed
Life style advices on contraceptive pills and follow-up in focal nodular hyperplasia and hepatocellular adenoma varied
Some guidelines did not provide specific recommendations for treatment of hepatocellular adenoma in men and differed in recommendations on subtype identification on MRI
Recognising differences can assist in harmonisation of practice standards, identify unmet needs in research, and may ultimately contribute to improved global patient care

### Hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma: an international multicenter study [^111zRPmc]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is an ultra-rare hepatic vascular tumor, diagnosed more frequently in females. The knowledge about this tumor derives mainly from small case series with sub-optimal treatment outcomes. The aim of this study is to identify the clinical and radiological issues helpful to develop an international prospective registry.

Methods

We conducted an international multicentric and retrospective study of patients with hepatic hemangioendothelioma. The clinical, pathological and radiological images collected during follow-up were reviewed. Central radiological revision was performed and 3 patterns of contrast were defined.

Results

Between 1994 and 2016, 27 patients with hepatic hemangioendothelioma were identified in three institutions but the final diagnosis was hepatic angiosarcoma in one. The majority were females, median age was 38.7-years and 17 patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis. No patient had Two out of ten (20%) patients had surgical specimens with positive macro-vascular invasion and 50% had extrahepatic disease, and the most frequent pattern was the progressive-central-contrast-uptake. After a median follow-up of 6.7-years, the 5- and 10-year survival rates are 91.5% and 51.9%, respectively.

Conclusions

This multicentric study shows the heterogeneous profile of patients with hepatic hemangioendothelioma, reflecting the need to establish a reference network in order to better characterize these patients and ultimately develop a personalized treatment strategy.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^1118d72i]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (HEHE) — perioperative biopsy, staging, and treatment guidance: If resection is planned because of imaging being highly suspicious for HEHE, a needle biopsy does not necessarily need to be performed before surgery. Patients with diagnosed HEHE should undergo imaging for staging of disease with whole-body contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or whole-body contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and PET-CT or PET-MRI may be considered with the understanding that HEHE is generally only mild or moderately PET avid. HEHE should be resected whenever possible, and if resection is not feasible, then liver transplantation offers the best survival, even in the setting of extrahepatic disease. In nonresectable and nontransplantable HEHE, there are very little data to guide treatment choices, patients should be referred to a specialty center whenever possible, ablative therapies and stereotactic body radiotherapy have shown some response in small studies, and there is no systemic therapy that can be recommended from published evidence.

### Diagnosis and follow-up of incidental liver lesions in children [^117VQYs5]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Incidental liver lesions are identified in children without underlying liver disease or increased risk of hepatic malignancy in childhood. Clinical and imaging evaluation of incidental liver lesions can be complex and may require a multidisciplinary approach. This review aims to summarize the diagnostic process and follow-up of incidental liver lesions based on review of the literature, use of state-of-the-art imaging, and our institutional experience. Age at presentation, gender, alpha fetoprotein levels, tumor size, and imaging characteristics should all be taken into consideration to optimize diagnosis process. Some lesions, such as simple liver cyst, infantile hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), and focal fatty lesions, have specific imaging characteristics. Recently, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) was Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the evaluation of pediatric liver lesions. CEUS is most specific in lesions smaller than 3cm and is most useful in the diagnosis of infantile hemangioma, FNH, and focal fatty lesions. The use of hepatobiliary contrast in MRI increases specificity in the diagnosis of FNH. Recently, lesion characteristics in MRI were found to correlate with subtypes of hepatocellular adenomas and associated risk for hemorrhage and malignant transformation. Biopsy should be considered when there are no specific imaging characteristics of a benign lesion. Surveillance with imaging and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) should be performed to confirm the stability of lesions when the diagnosis cannot be determined, and whenever biopsy is not feasible.

### Scoping review of clinical practice guidelines on the management of benign liver tumours [^113dkfwA]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Hepatic incidentalomas are increasingly diagnosed due to the frequent use of diagnostic imaging. These pathologies have a prevalence of about 15% in general but are observed in up to 30% of individuals older than 40 years. The majority of hepatic incidentalomas are benign and include hepatic cysts, focal fatty sparing and benign liver tumours (BLT).BLT comprise a heterogeneous group of tumours with distinct cellular origins, characterised by non-metastasizing, non-invasive behaviour. Most common BLT are hepatic haemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), and hepatocellular adenoma (HCA), which differ extensively in their clinical consequences.

Hepatic haemangiomas are hypervascular tumours not at risk for malignant transformation. Rupture is extremely unlikely, often only after blunt trauma and is associated with high mortality. Large hepatic haemangiomas (≥ 5 cm) can cause abdominal pain and nausea by compression or, in rare cases, cause consumptive coagulopathy (Kasabach-Merritt syndrome).

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^1114mUwy]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Focal liver lesions (FLLs) — scope and terminology emphasize that FLLs have become an increasingly common finding on abdominal imaging, especially asymptomatic and incidental lesions, and that gastroenterologists and hepatologists often manage lesion types including hepatocellular adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, hemangioma, and hepatic cystic lesions including polycystic liver disease. Malignancy is important to consider in the differential diagnosis, and this American College of Gastroenterology practice guideline uses the best evidence available to make diagnosis and management recommendations for the most common FLLs. FLLs are solid or cystic lesions identified as an abnormality in the liver, and for this update the term "lesion" will be used instead of "mass".

### Imaging for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113x9bXB]. Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance follow-up — management of nodules lacking complete hallmark features is described as follows: When computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detects a nodule with some, but not all, hallmark features, the differential includes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), non-HCC malignancy, and nonmalignant entities. Prior clinical practice guidelines by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommended biopsy for all liver lesions > 1 cm initially detected by surveillance ultrasound and interpreted as indeterminate by diagnostic call-back CT and MRI. The evidence supporting this recommendation was not provided, and due to limitations of biopsy and complexities of working up suspected HCC, alternative strategies such as follow-up or alternative imaging may be preferable in individual cases.

### Scoping review of clinical practice guidelines on the management of benign liver tumours [^116jbqCE]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Our observations might have influence on two important topics: (1) creation of global clinical practice uniformity and (2) identifying areas of future research. First, although comparing and analysing clinical practice guidelines may not directly benefit medical professionals or patients, our observations clearly show significant differences in BLT guideline design, content, and considerations between continents. This may encourage global professionals in expanding their scope when facing clinical dilemmas. Additionally, guideline authors and policy makers could take previously drafted guidelines into account when updating recommendations. This could create uniformity by raising global awareness of the differences in approaching various BLT.

In conclusion, three guidelines on BLT were identified, and several differences were identified on diagnostic workup and management of hepatic haemangioma, FNH, and HCA after comparison. These included: use of a dedicated BLT multidisciplinary team for management decisions, indications for biopsy, timing and duration of follow-up, conservative management of FNH, diagnosis of HCA subtypes on MRI, and (conservative) management of HCA. These differences could lead to a practice variation, and thereby to varying outcomes. By recognising these differences, future research and debate should be focused on both harmonisation of clinical practice standards and remaining lacunas for BLT to achieve best patient care worldwide.

### Reproductive health and liver disease: practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^112ck176]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) — epidemiology and pregnancy course are summarized as follows: FNH is described as "the second most common benign liver lesion, with a prevalence of 0.3% to 3%, and is commonly diagnosed in reproductive-aged women", and may coexist with hemangiomas "in up to 20% of cases". During pregnancy, prior cohorts reported that "of the 12 pregnancies that occurred in the latter study, no significant change in the size of lesions was observed, with no instances of maternal or fetal mortality", and that replication showed "only one case of hepatic rupture reported in the literature". Accordingly, "Thus, both CHC use and pregnancy are considered safe, with no monitoring required".

### Vascular liver disorders, portal vein thrombosis, and procedural bleeding in patients with liver disease: 2020 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^115mfWHZ]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Hepatic vein thrombosis/Budd-Chiari syndrome (HVT/BCS) — nodular lesions and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance: Around 40% of patients develop nodular liver lesions during follow-up that are usually benign and are usually multiple (> 10 lesions), small in size (< 4 cm), hypervascular, and disseminated throughout the liver. In one study, the cumulative incidence of HCC was 6% at 7 years of follow-up, and patients with long-term inferior vena cava (IVC) obstruction seem to have a higher risk for HCC. A level of alpha-fetoprotein > 15 ng/mL has been suggested as a predictive biomarker for HCC in HVT/BCS patients; however, this threshold cannot be recommended in clinical practice until validated in larger studies. Although specific data are lacking, surveillance for HCC in chronic HVT/BCS with ultrasound with or without alpha-fetoprotein levels every 6 months is recommended, and suspicious lesions should escalate to contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging and/or biopsy if lesion nature is uncertain on imaging. The Liver Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) criteria for CT/MR interpretation specifically exclude patients with HVT/BCS and should not be applied to this population.

### Ultrasonographic diagnosis and follow-up of a special type of giant fetal hepatic hemangioma [^1145eRpe]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

There is no consensus on the dynamic monitoring and treatment of hepatic hemangiomas, and management is tailored to tumor classification and the newborn's clinical condition. Fetuses with hepatic hemangiomas should have an ultrasound scan immediately after birth, particularly for giant fetal hepatic hemangioma. Asymptomatic infants are generally monitored for at least 1 year, as most hemangiomas regress spontaneously by age 1 year. Symptomatic cases presenting with dyspnea, heart failure, or hypothyroidism require medical treatment, transhepatic arterial embolization, or surgical resection. Propranolol is the first choice for treating hepatic hemangiomas in infants and children. In addition, combining rapamycin with propranolol and glucocorticoids may enhance therapeutic outcomes. Relatively, their side effects are greater. In children with poor response to medical treatment, high-flow arteriovenous shunting, and rapidly deteriorating cardiac function, urgent transcatheter hepatic arteriovenous fistula embolization is highly effective. When medical treatment fails and symptoms are severe, with focal or multiple lesions, surgical resection is effective. Regardless of the treatment plan, regular follow-up evaluations should be conducted through ultrasound examination to make the most reasonable adjustments promptly.

Ultrasound is non-invasive, effective, inexpensive, and practical for diagnosing hepatic hemangiomas. Its continuous dynamic scanning and color Doppler US provide detailed insights into the blood supply of the tumor and the function of other blood vessels in the liver and heart, making it the preferred method. For prenatal detection of giant liver hemangiomas, a systematic assessment of the fetal condition is crucial for determining delivery timing, postnatal examination, treatment options, and follow-up care.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^111fc4w9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Incidental focal liver lesions (FLLs) — initial evaluation and management: Incidental liver lesions can be defined as suspected findings within the liver, which are often identified on outpatient or emergency department imaging performed to investigate an unrelated clinical symptom such as pain, weight loss, or trauma, and imaging studies performed under these circumstances are usually either an abdominal ultrasound or contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen, and while they may identify a FLL, they cannot adequately characterize the lesion itself. Given the extensive categories of benign and malignant pathologies of FLLs, as well as differences in management, liver-directed imaging is often needed for adequate clarification; however, there are a few instances where further workup of incidental FLLs is not necessary, specifically if the imaging appearance on abdominal ultrasound or single-phase CT is characteristic for a hemangioma or benign uncomplicated cyst. In most instances, characterization of liver lesions requires careful investigation of the medical history, clinical symptomatology, physical examination, laboratory workup, and imaging, with attention to histories that suggest increased risk such as previous cancer, constitutional symptoms, foreign travel, medications including oral contraceptive pills, hormone supplementation, or steroids, and risk factors for chronic liver disease. Detection is common, with some studies showing that up to 52% of patients without cancer have a benign liver lesion at autopsy and the American College of Radiology reporting that up to 15% of patients have an incidental liver lesion detected on routine noninvasive imaging; common modalities detecting incidental lesions include ultrasonography (US) with or without contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (HEHE) — imaging, diagnosis, and management: The "target" sign on imaging is described as an inner ring with "a fibrotic center, a middle ring of epithelial proliferation, and an outer ring defined by an avascular zone", and "capsular retraction, lollipop sign, and the target sign together is fairly specific for HEHE", prompting investigation; HEHE is "mildly or moderately PET avid", where "PET-CT or PET-MRI may be used", although "whole-body CT or whole-body MRI is the preferred imaging modality". For diagnosis, "pathology is necessary to confirm the diagnosis", and if resection is being considered, resection can proceed without biopsy, whereas "if resection is not imminently planned, then one needle biopsy must be performed". Treatment-wise, "surgical resection is the preferred treatment with 70%–80% cure rates after an R0 resection", and for those not eligible for resection, "liver transplantation is also an accepted treatment for HEHE with 5-year survival of 77%", with extrahepatic disease "not considered to be a contraindication"; the largest cohort found transplant had "the best survival". For nonsurgical candidates, expert sources "recommend ablative therapies or stereotactic body radiotherapy". Systemic therapy "is not often recommended" and "should only be considered" with progression or marked systemic symptoms, with reported outcomes showing "overall survival generally less than 2 years".

### Assessing normal growth of hepatic hemangiomas… [^111h5dne]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Retrospective cohort study at an academic hospital tertiary referral center evaluating the growth rate of hepatic hemangiomas on cross-sectional imaging studies during a 10-year period. The mean follow-up time was 3. 7 years. The radiology information system was searched in a 10-year period for hemangioma. The aim of this study was therefore 2-fold. First, we aimed to accurately establish the fraction of hemangiomas that grow during long-term follow-up using modern cross-sectional imaging and radiographic techniques. Second, we aimed to define a measure of hemangioma growth that could be used clinically to help identify hemangiomas for which growth is more than expected when compared with the population. Images were reviewed by 2 experienced, board-certified radiologists for diagnostic confirmation and to ensure that the same lesion was followed up serially.

In addition, each lesion was remeasured linearly in 3 dimensions, and volumetric measurements were performed on a dedicated independent postprocessing workstation. The hemangiomas were manually contoured with slice-to-slice interpolation and visual confirmation. In addition, data collected from the medical records included demographic data, comorbidities, indications for imaging, and relevant hepatic outcomes. First, in several previous studies, only symptomatic patients were reimaged, increasing the population for larger hemangiomas. Second, we included all patients with hemangiomas larger than 1 cm who had at least 1 year of follow-up, thereby capturing more points in time. Finally, most prior studies relied almost solely on ultrasound imaging, with which reproducible measurement is much more difficult and user dependent.

Furthermore, in some series, larger lesions were excluded owing to difficulty in obtaining accurate measurements, thus eliminating the lesions in which we identified the highest growth rates. 2, 11, 13. To our knowledge, this study is the first to use advanced cross-sectional imaging alone to describe the growth rate of hemangiomas during long-term follow-up. Use of advanced cross-sectional imaging allows not only for more precision in diagnosis but also for a more reliable means of assessment of growth, as the lesions can be measured in a defined plane and compared directly on follow-up studies. As a result, this study is the first to examine change in hemangioma volume, which is the most accurate measure of hemangioma size.

### Hepatic ultrasonography for surveillance in uveal melanoma… [^116orraj]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

F, Metastatic tumor confirmed on subsequent computed tomographic imaging. Survival of patients with uveal melanoma diagnosed by onset of symptoms, undergoing surveillance with periodic liver function tests only, and undergoing surveillance with hepatic ultrasonography.

Data pertain to 259 symptomatic patients in the study by Kim et al, 19 90 asymptomatic patients in the study by Kim et al, 19 and 30 patients with biopsy-confirmed metastasis in the present series. Retrospective cohort study reviewing data from patients with primary uveal melanoma treated between October 2003 and October 2012 at a multispecialty tertiary care center. Patients were managed using a standardized protocol. Initial staging was done with contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

This was followed by periodic surveillance with hepatic USG and liver function tests scheduled every 6 months for the first 5 years and annually thereafter. Conclusions and Relevance A stepwise surveillance protocol based on serial hepatic USGs followed by confirmatory scans offers high likelihood of detecting asymptomatic metastases in patients with primary uveal melanoma. baseline contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis as part of systemic staging at the time of initial ophthalmic diagnosis and prior to any therapeutic intervention and following it with systemic surveillance with hepatic USG and LFTs every 6 months for the first 5 years and annually thereafter as part of routine clinical practice since 2004. We herein report the utility of serial hepatic USG and compare outcomes of our patients with those reported in the literature.

There is a lack of information regarding the role of systemic surveillance following treatment in patients with primary uveal melanoma. The utility of serial hepatic ultrasonography for detection of asymptomatic liver metastasis in patients undergoing surveillance was evaluated. If indicated, abnormalities on hepatic ultrasonography were confirmed by additional imaging modalities such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. We recommend baseline staging at the initial ophthalmic diagnosis and a stepwise surveillance protocol based on serial hepatic USG scans followed by confirmatory scans, prior to liver biopsy, to be included in a comprehensive management strategy for patients with primary uveal melanoma. Although such a surveillance protocol offers a high likelihood of detecting asymptomatic metastasis, it may not provide survival advantage.

### Long-term results of surgery for liver hemangiomas… [^114LFzqp]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Enucleation was the most frequent operation. Hospital mortality and morbidity were 2. 4% and 12%, respectively. Thirty-three patients could be followed up for a median of 53 months. Control ultrasonography revealed no recurrences. There were no changes in the dimensions of the 10 hemangiomas left in 5 patients during median follow-up of 38 months. Four patients had a single hemangioma and 1 patient had 5 hemangiomas. With the advent of tagged red blood cell scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging, diagnostic uncertainty has become rare. 15–17 The reported sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of scintigraphy are 89%, 100%, and 95%, respectively. The corresponding figures for magnetic resonance imaging are 90%, 92%, and 90%, respectively.

With the combined use of various imaging techniques, the diagnosis can be established in most patients. 9, 18 However, exceptions to pathognomonic signs do occur, 19, 20 but these are rare. Still, 100% diagnostic accuracy with imaging techniques is impossible. 18, 21 One approach may be to use the laboratory and imaging techniques to the fullest extent and perform laparotomy in the still dubious patients. 18 In the Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery Unit, we perform 2 independent imaging techniques, standard liver biochemistry tests, and tumor marker measurements. If the results of these tests are compatible with the diagnosis of hemangioma in an asymptomatic patient, we include the patient in the follow-up program. In the last 3 years of the study, we did not have any patients who underwent surgery for diagnostic uncertainty.

On one hand, enlargement, especially early enlargement, may alert the physician in a recently diagnosed liver mass that was evaluated as a hemangioma and included in the follow-up program. On the other hand, nonmalignant enlargement of hemangiomas occurs in a small subset of patients. Even when the diagnosis is definite, it is prudent to follow up patients with large hemangiomas at regular intervals.

### Risk of hepatic hemangiomas in infants with large hemangiomas… [^116MyGCC]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 While most infantile hemangiomas are benign and uncomplicated, a minority may have associated internal involvement that can lead to significant morbidity. 1, 2 Multiple cutaneous hemangiomas have been recognized as potential markers of underlying hepatic hemangiomas. 1–4 Two recent retrospective studies suggest that infants with large and/or segmental cutaneous hemangiomas are also at risk for hepatic hemangiomas. 2, 3 These reports have led many clinicians to screen infants with large cutaneous hemangiomas for hepatic hemangiomas. An algorithm for the evaluation and management of hepatic hemangiomas in asymptomatic infants with multiple cutaneous hemangiomas, based on retrospective data, has recently been published. 4 However, controversy remains regarding the number of cutaneous hemangiomas that should serve as the threshold at which to perform such screening.

5 Definitive guidelines regarding the workup for hepatic hemangiomas in asymptomatic infants with large cutaneous hemangiomas, particularly within the first few months of life, are lacking in the literature. Institutional review board approval was obtained at each site. A standardized questionnaire was completed on each infant. The hemangiomas were classified based on morphologic characteristics and size, with size determined by measuring 2 perpendicular surface diameters with a flexible measuring tape. Physical examination and abdominal ultrasonography were performed on each infant. Our findings suggest that infants with large cutaneous hemangiomas may not be at an increased risk for concomitant hepatic hemangiomas as initially reported in the literature and as seen in infants with multiple cutaneous hemangiomas.

Hughes et al3 retrospectively reported the cases of 25 infants with solitary, large cutaneous hemangiomas, 3 of whom had clinically asymptomatic hepatic hemangiomas identified on abdominal ultrasonography. Based on the results of the present study, routine screening ultrasonography for hepatic involvement in asymptomatic infants with large cutaneous hemangiomas may not be necessary unless clinically indicated. However, because some infants may present with significant hepatic hemangiomas with few or no cutaneous hemangiomas, and until the true risk of this possible association is known, infants with large cutaneous hemangiomas should continue to be clinically monitored, especially during the first 6 months of life when the risk of complications associated with hepatic hemangiomas is considered to be the greatest.
