## Question

Outflow stenosis in a fistula

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about outflow stenosis in an arteriovenous fistula, including how to define it, how to detect it, how to decide when to treat, and what to do about it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and why outflow stenosis matters. Then, I should verify the clinical signs and how to distinguish inflow from outflow problems. Next, I will review diagnostic tools, including physical examination, ultrasound, and angiography, and I need to check the thresholds that trigger intervention. After that, I should examine treatment options, including balloons, drug-coated balloons, and stents, and consider special scenarios like central venous stenosis. Finally, I will integrate surveillance, surveillance controversies, and a practical decision framework, making sure I double-check where the evidence is strong versus uncertain.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology and why outflow stenosis is clinically important. Outflow stenosis increases resistance and upstream pressure, reducing effective dialysis flow and promoting recirculation, which degrades dialysis adequacy and increases thrombosis risk; this is best understood as an inflow–outflow imbalance rather than a purely anatomic label, and the hemodynamic impact depends on both the degree of narrowing and the access flow rate, so a 50% stenosis in a large vein may be less consequential than a smaller-diameter lesion at the same percentage reduction [^111Es43U] [^112EbfVA].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical signs that point to outflow stenosis. On inspection, I should look for arm swelling, distended collateral veins, and failure of the access to collapse with arm elevation; on palpation, a focal water-hammer pulse with loss of the normal continuous thrill suggests a stenosis; on auscultation, a high-pitched, discontinuous, systolic-only bruit is concerning; during dialysis, high venous pressures, prolonged bleeding, and difficulty achieving target pump flows are red flags, and I should remember that these findings track with KDOQI's clinical indicators of access dysfunction [^113Trpdd] [^112YdKir] [^111hAPXA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis without anchoring it to objective testing. I need to check the performance of physical examination: trained examiners can detect outflow stenosis with high sensitivity and specificity, and the arm elevation test is particularly useful; however, accuracy varies with examiner experience, so abnormal PE findings should prompt confirmatory imaging rather than immediate intervention, and I should double-check that I'm not missing inflow disease masquerading as outflow problems [^114hJxJv] [^111uwCgC] [^113d9CHG].

> Next, I should review ultrasound because it is noninvasive and widely available. Duplex can visualize the stenosis, quantify peak systolic velocity, and estimate access flow; a PSV greater than about 300 cm/s in the vein with downstream flow reduction is suspicious for a hemodynamically significant lesion, but I need to ensure I correlate with clinical findings because ultrasound criteria are not perfectly standardized and operator dependence is real [^112fjLuT].

> I will now examine angiography, since it remains the gold standard when a lesion is suspected or intervention is planned. Angiography defines anatomy, localizes the stenosis, and allows concurrent treatment; I should confirm that the study spans the arterial inflow, the access itself, and the venous outflow to the central veins, because missing a central venous lesion can doom repeat peripheral interventions [^115th1CA] [^111Qgw2V].

> Let me think about when to treat, and I should double-check the traditional 50% threshold. Historically, a greater than 50% diameter reduction plus clinical or physiologic abnormalities has been used to define a clinically significant stenosis, but wait, I should verify whether this is too simplistic; indeed, percentage stenosis alone correlates poorly with flow impact, and some data support using a higher anatomic threshold, such as about 75%, when guided by physical examination findings like PESOS, to avoid overtreatment while still preventing thrombosis; ultimately, treatment decisions should integrate symptoms, hemodynamics, and the patient's life plan rather than a single percentage [^1144TfsR] [^112EbfVA] [^114Y4vDa] [^117Jxn8f].

> I need to ensure I distinguish inflow from outflow disease because management differs. Inflow stenosis typically presents with weak or absent thrill, poor augmentation with manual compression, and low access flows, whereas outflow stenosis shows hyperpulsatility, high venous pressures, and arm swelling; importantly, inflow stenosis can blunt venous pressure signals and delay recognition of outflow stenosis, so I should actively look for both when dysfunction is suspected [^113d9CHG] [^111uwCgC].

> Now, I should review first-line therapy. Standard high-pressure balloon angioplasty remains the initial treatment for most stenoses, with excellent technical success and immediate restoration of flow; I should confirm that resistant lesions may need prolonged inflation or higher-pressure balloons, and I must remember that restenosis is common, so counseling on surveillance and potential reintervention is essential [^117Fq2tU] [^1156YVRG].

> But wait, what if the stenosis recurs quickly or is particularly fibrotic. Drug-coated balloons can reduce restenosis in select scenarios, and although I initially thought the evidence was uniformly strong, I should correct that: data are mixed and largely observational, so DCBs are reasonable for recurrent lesions or high-risk anatomy, but I need to individualize and avoid overuse where standard PTA suffices [^116CM28j] [^111eFx25].

> I should confirm when stents are indicated. Covered stents are favored for recurrent venous outflow stenosis, for lesions at the graft–vein junction, and for resistant cephalic arch stenosis where balloon angioplasty often fails; stent grafts may also mitigate neointimal hyperplasia and provide a scaffold in fragile veins, but I need to preserve surgical options and avoid stenting across joints when possible [^117P9onA] [^113DD9WN] [^112C3D9i].

> Let me consider central venous stenosis, because missing it guarantees repeated failures. Central venous stenosis or occlusion can be silent or present with arm swelling and collateral veins; management ranges from angioplasty with or without stenting to surgical decompression such as medial claviculectomy for thoracic outlet compression, and I should coordinate with a multidisciplinary team to align with the patient's access life plan [^111T8LBq] [^114WGFEN] [^116rppZw].

> Next, I should review surveillance and its controversies. Routine surveillance can detect more stenoses and reduce thrombosis in some studies, but it also increases procedures without clear mortality benefit; KDOQI emphasizes skilled physical examination as the foundation, with selective use of flow or ultrasound, and shared decision-making is key when considering preemptive repair of subclinical lesions [^1169vwgu] [^115RFSqz] [^113bY9w4].

> Hold on, I should verify a practical decision framework. If clinical indicators suggest outflow stenosis, I obtain confirmatory imaging; if a hemodynamically significant lesion is confirmed, I proceed to angioplasty, escalating to DCB or stent for recurrence or special anatomy; if the access is high flow with symptoms, I consider flow reduction strategies; and throughout, I integrate the patient's goals, alternative access options, and the life plan to avoid futile interventions [^116mLWrm] [^113gh4JU] [^117P9onA].

> Finally, I need to ensure longitudinal care is explicit. After successful treatment, I arrange follow-up with repeat clinical examination and, when indicated, ultrasound to detect restenosis early; I educate the dialysis team on warning signs, and I maintain a low threshold to re-image if symptoms recur, recognizing that early detection and timely reintervention are the cornerstones of durable access patency [^1169vwgu] [^112LpyY8].

Outflow stenosis in a fistula is a **narrowing of the venous outflow tract** that increases resistance, reduces access flow, and can cause thrombosis or access failure [^112fjLuT]. It is most often due to neointimal hyperplasia at the juxta-anastomotic segment, cephalic arch, or central veins, and is best detected by combining physical examination with duplex ultrasound or fistulography [^112fjLuT] [^115th1CA]. Management is **angioplasty first-line**, with drug-coated balloons or stents for recurrent or resistant lesions, and surgery for refractory cases or central venous obstruction [^117Fq2tU] [^111eFx25] [^114WGFEN]. Early recognition and treatment prevent thrombosis, prolong access life, and reduce catheter use and hospitalizations [^111iWu49] [^115RFSqz].

---

## Pathophysiology

Outflow stenosis arises from **neointimal hyperplasia** driven by turbulent flow, shear stress, and endothelial injury, leading to smooth muscle proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition [^112fjLuT]. Common sites include the juxta-anastomotic vein, cephalic arch, and central veins, with extrinsic compression (e.g. thoracic outlet, mediastinal structures) as a less frequent contributor [^114TXUkV] [^113DD9WN] [^114WGFEN].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include:

- **Arm swelling**: ipsilateral edema from venous hypertension [^113Trpdd].
- **Prolonged bleeding**: post-dialysis from elevated venous pressure [^113Trpdd].
- **High venous pressures**: > 200 mmHg during dialysis [^112fjLuT].
- **Reduced thrill**: discontinuous or absent, especially with arm elevation [^112HnS3u].
- **Difficulty cannulating**: from altered hemodynamics [^113Trpdd].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Physical examination

On examination, look for **hyperpulsatility** with a water-hammer pulse and a discontinuous or absent thrill, especially when the arm is elevated (arm elevation test) [^112HnS3u]. Collateral veins may be prominent, and the access may fail to collapse with elevation, indicating outflow obstruction [^111hAPXA].

---

### Imaging modalities

| **Modality** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Duplex ultrasound | Noninvasive; detects stenosis, flow, and collaterals; high sensitivity/specificity | Operator-dependent; limited by obesity or edema [^116xDpU8] |
| Fistulography | Gold standard; anatomically precise; allows concurrent intervention | Invasive; contrast risks; not for routine screening [^115th1CA] |
| CT/MR venography | Useful for central venous stenosis | Costly; limited availability; contrast issues |

---

## Hemodynamic significance

A stenosis is **hemodynamically significant** when it causes a pressure drop and flow reduction that impairs dialysis. While a > 50% diameter reduction is commonly used, the clinical impact depends on lesion length, flow, and collaterals; thus, functional assessment (pressures, flow) is essential [^116oRLWq] [^112EbfVA].

---

## Management strategies

### Endovascular interventions

- **Balloon angioplasty**: first-line for most stenoses; high success and low complication rates [^117Fq2tU].
- **Drug-coated balloons**: reduce restenosis in recurrent lesions [^notfound].
- **Stent placement**: for elastic recoil, recurrent stenosis, or central venous lesions; covered stents preferred in some scenarios [^117P9onA] [^112C3D9i].

---

### Surgical interventions

Surgical options include **surgical revision** — such as bypass, vein transposition, or creation of a new anastomosis — for refractory or complex lesions, and **central venous bypass** for recalcitrant central venous stenosis or occlusion [^114WGFEN].

---

## Outcomes and complications

Angioplasty yields high technical success and improved access flow, but restenosis is common and may require repeat interventions [^1156YVRG]. Complications include vessel rupture, thrombosis, and infection, though major adverse events are uncommon with experienced operators [^116CM28j].

---

## Prevention and surveillance

Regular clinical monitoring with physical examination and selective ultrasound detects stenosis early [^1169vwgu]. Preemptive repair of hemodynamically significant stenosis reduces thrombosis and prolongs access patency, though surveillance strategies should be individualized to balance benefits and procedural risks [^111iWu49] [^115RFSqz].

---

Outflow stenosis is a **common, consequential cause of fistula dysfunction**; early detection with exam plus ultrasound, and timely angioplasty with escalation as needed, are key to preserving access and reducing catheter dependence.

### Management of vascular access inflow-outflow imbalance: a bimodal approach [^113gh4JU]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

When a dialysis patient presents with clinical indicators suggestive of the presence of venous outflow stenosis, it is important to realize that these indicators are actually the result of an inflow-outflow imbalance. The treatment of this imbalance requires individualization based upon identification of the pathophysiology involved. A high flow AV access can have significant impact on the long-term morbidity and mortality of patients on dialysis, many of whom already have a considerable burden of comorbidities. A bimodal approach to therapy that includes an understanding and assessment of the underlying pathophysiology should be employed to optimize and individualize management. In many instances, angioplasty to treat the offending outflow lesion will be appropriate; however, in some cases, access flow reduction is required for management.

Introduction

A common complication associated with the arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is venous stenosis affecting venous outflow. The KDOQI Clinical Practice Guidelines for Vascular Access(KDOQI Guidelines) state that a clinically significant stenosis, that is, critical stenosis, within the hemodialysis access circuit is associated with clinical indicators which can be determined either by physical examination of the arteriovenous (AV) access or the recognition of problems occurring during dialysis treatment (Table 1).

Table 1.
Clinical indicators of AV access flow dysfunction.

These clinical indicators have a direct relationship to access blood flow (Qa) and pressure in the AV access. Although this situation is generally referred to as venous stenosis, a more accurate, descriptive, and clinically useful diagnosis, based upon pathophysiology, is inflow-outflow imbalance. In other words, the total outflow capacity of the AV access is inadequate to handle the inflow without an increase in pressure. The relative inadequacy of the access outflow capacity in comparison to inflow results in increased outflow resistance and a proportional increase in intraluminal pressure. Outflow capacity is often defined by a single enlarged venous outflow conduit. However, stenosis or occlusion of the main outflow vein may result in multiple collateral veins developing into adequate outflow capacity or in only partial outflow vein capacity improvement while remaining inadequate to normalize pressure and Qa. The clinical indicators associated with venous stenosis are the manifestations of this imbalance. The point at which this occurs is dependent upon variations in these two parameters — inflow volume and outflow resistance. The variations in these two parameters are considerable and reciprocal (Figure 1). Any given outflow luminal diameter (OLD) may not be problematic at a lower Qa but may be very problematic at a higher blood flow level or when increased due to arteriovenous anastomosis remodeling or percutaneous balloon angioplasty of a significant stenosis. In other words, as Qa increases, the total cross-sectional OLD required to create an increase in resistance decreases. With extremely high flow, the signs and symptoms of inflow-outflow embalance can be mainifest with no reduction in OLD. When clinically indicated, resolution of this common and potentially serious dilemma may be approached by one or both of two options: (1) reducing flow and pressure in the access or (2) increasing the OLD. In this review, we discuss such a bimodal approach to inflow-outflow imbalance.

Discussion

Sudden, unexpected vascular access thrombosis is associated with subsequent temporary hemodialysis catheter placement and interventional procedures or surgery to salvage the vascular access. In the present study, about one-third of the patients with AVFs in the PESOS condition were asymptomatic during hemodialysis, and their percentage stenosis showed no difference from that of their symptomatic counterparts.

We believe that an asymptomatic PESOS patient should be considered to be at as high a risk as a symptomatic PESOS patient and should be treated in a timely fashion to avoid unexpected vascular access thrombosis. However, asymptomatic PESOS patients are often not diagnosed and usually remain untreated, unless under vascular access surveillance. Flow-based surveillance is the most studied tool for this task. Its goal is to identify patients with > 50% stenosis, which could range from 51 to 99%. Although active blood flow surveillance and preemptive repair of subclinical stenosis have been reported to be beneficial in reducing the thrombosis rate and prolonging the functional life of mature AVFs, the treatment of all patients with > 50% stenosis, especially when their AVF is functioning normally, is still controversial. Moreover, in the search for an optimal bedside screening tool for AVF, Tessitore et al. reported that Qa is not a good surveillance tool for the detection of access outflow stenosis. It is important to note that low Qa is indicative of a hemodynamic derangement in outflow stenosis, rather than of its anatomical severity. Indeed, the same reduction in Qa might be caused by a single area of severe stenosis or more than two simultaneous moderate areas of stenosis.

Several recent studies have shown that high shear stress at the stenosis can activate platelets and von Willebrand factor, and the shear micro-gradient across the stenosis promotes platelet aggregation. Therefore, higher percentage stenosis results in higher risk of thrombosis. In our opinion, stenosis with a high risk of thrombosis (high-risk stenosis) is equally as dangerous as stenosis with a high enough shear stress to activate platelets and von Willebrand factor, and could elicit a coagulation cascade. However, it remains unknown how narrow (in millimeters) a high-risk stenosis should be to be labeled "high risk". Nevertheless, we agree that an area of stenosis with a minimum luminal diameter of < 2 mm should be identified and treated, as recommended by the Spanish Guidelines, because it plays a role in preventing unexpected AVF thrombosis.

### Clinical practice guidelines for vascular access [^1144TfsR]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Guideline 5. Treatment of fistula complications — indications for intervention specifies that intervention on a fistula should be performed for inadequate flow to support the prescribed dialysis blood flow, hemodynamically significant venous stenosis, aneurysm formation in a primary fistula with correction of postanastomotic stenosis that drives aneurysm and avoidance of cannulation of the aneurysmal segment, and ischemia in the access arm. For preemptive percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), a fistula with a greater than 50% stenosis in either the venous outflow or arterial inflow, in conjunction with clinical or physiological abnormalities, should be treated with PTA or surgical revision, and abnormalities include reduction in flow, increase in static pressures, access recirculation preempting adequate delivery of dialysis, or abnormal physical findings.

### A UK expert consensus approach for managing symptomatic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) stenosis in haemodialysis patients [^111eFx25]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Stenoses in mature arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are common and can negatively impact on the quality of haemodialysis, the longevity of the AVF and lead to debilitating symptoms. Multiple treatment options exist; however, management can vary between different centres. We aimed to establish multidisciplinary consensus on the optimal stepwise application of interventions based on evidence and consensus.

Methods

A modified Delphi process was conducted with 13 participants from hospitals across the UK, all of whom have high-volume dialysis access practice.

Results

The usual intervention to rectify de novo stenoses of mature AVFs is fistuloplasty, although surgery for inflow segment stenoses is also clinically acceptable. Appropriate first-line interventions include plain old balloon angioplasty or high-pressure balloon angioplasty; if these fail during the fistuloplasty, consider upsizing the balloon, prolonged balloon inflation or using alternative interventions, such as cutting or scoring balloons and ultra-high-pressure balloons. Alternative or subsequent interventions vary by anatomical site and may require additional multidisciplinary team input. For a stenoses recurring between 3 and 12 months, it is appropriate to consider interventions used de novo, but with a lower threshold for using drug-coated balloons (DCBs) in all regions and for using stent grafts in all regions but inflow segment. Recurrence after 12 months should be treated as a de novo lesion, with DCBs considered if they have been used successfully during previous interventions.

Conclusions

These recommendations aim to provide a practical guide to multidisciplinary teams in order to optimise the use of multiple interventions for rectifying AVF stenoses and provide unified evidence-based practice guidelines.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^113Trpdd]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI vascular access guideline — Clinical indicators during monitoring identify potential clinically significant arteriovenous (AV) access lesions and include ipsilateral extremity edema; alterations in the pulse, with a weak or resistant pulse, difficult to compress, in the area of stenosis; abnormal thrill (weak and/or discontinuous) with only a systolic component in the region of stenosis; abnormal bruit (high pitched with a systolic component in the area of stenosis); failure of the fistula to collapse when the arm is elevated (outflow stenosis) and lack of pulse augmentation (inflow stenosis); and excessive collapse of the venous segment upon arm elevation. During dialysis, concerning signs are new difficulty with cannulation when previously not a problem, aspiration of clots, inability to achieve the target dialysis blood flow, prolonged bleeding beyond usual for that patient from the needle puncture sites for 3 consecutive dialysis sessions, and unexplained (> 0.2 units) decrease in the delivered dialysis dose (Kt/V) on a constant dialysis prescription without prolongation of dialysis duration.

Effect of stenosis on hemodynamics — grafts and fistulae are affected at characteristic sites: in grafts, the majority of stenoses develop in the venous outflow, frequently right at or within several centimeters of the venous anastomosis; lesions within the graft also occur, and most accesses have more than 1 lesion at any 1 time, with the pathophysiological state of graft failure arising from neointimal hyperplasia. In a fistula, there may be ischemic effects, as well as injury resulting from recurrent cannulation and subsequent fibrosis, and stenoses in a fistula tend to occur at the surgical swing sites (including the arterial anastomosis) or the puncture zone of the vein.

Anatomical indications for treatment

The KDOQI Guidelinesstate that appropriate imaging of the dialysis circuit should identify the culprit lesion and suggest definitive treatment strategies. They further state that standard balloon angioplasty remains the treatment of choice for the majority of anatomic and clinically significant stenotic lesion. Recurrent lesions may require treatment with drug-coated balloons, covered stents, surgical bypass, or other interventions. A stenotic lesion that justifies treatment, referred to as critical stenosis, has been defined as one that is accompanied by clinical signs and symptoms (Table 1) and shows > 50% narrowing relative to adjacent normal vein diameter by angiography or ultrasound. The 50% reduction in luminal diameter as a definition for critical stenosis is problematic for at least two reasons. First, the outflow vein is marked by varying degrees of diameter throughout its length, – there is no adjacent normal vessel (Figure 2). When the area of narrowing is evaluated, the diameter proximally and distally often varies considerably.

Figure 2.
Variability in vein diameter.

The effect of minimal lumen diameter

Second, a 50% stenosis occurring in an AVF segment characterized by a diameter of 8 mm has very different flow characteristics from a 50% stenosis in a segment with a diameter of 14 mm. While both of these cases fit the definition of venous outflow stenoses, the pathophysiology as it relates to Qa is quite different. A major concern prompting the treatment of venous outflow stenosis is the concern that the lesion could result in a decreased Qa eventually leading to thrombosis of the AV access. However, the correlation between percentage stenosis and a clinically significant decrease in Qa is low. While a 50% decrease in luminal diameter in a 6 mm vein may produce a marked decrease in Qa, a 50% decrease in luminal diameter for a 14 mm vein may have no effect on flow or even be associated with an abnormally high Qa (Figure 3).

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline on vascular access for haemodialysis [^111uwCgC]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical evaluation forms the mainstay of the assessment of vascular access dysfunction, with several authors highlighting its value. Asif studied 142 patients referred for angiography, comparing radiological diagnosis with examination findings, such as pulse augmentation (failure of transient fistula compression to augment the pulse indicating inflow stenosis) and arm elevation (failure of arm elevation to reduce fistula fullness indicating outflow stenosis). Examination findings were 85% sensitive and 71% specific for detecting an inflow lesion, and 92% sensitive and 86% specific for detecting an outflow stenosis. Similar support for clinical examination came from Coentrao who also noted the value of specific training in improving the accuracy of clinical skills.

Though some high quality studies are available, the literature on access complications is limited by small study populations, heterogeneity and short term outcomes, leaving many knowledge gaps, so that an evidence-based consensus is not possible for all aspects of management. One consistent theme is uncertainty of outcome, suggesting the need for pragmatic shared decisions taking into account clinical risk (e.g. of access loss or haemorrhage), likely treatment outcome and patient preference. Although in many cases the access may be successfully salvaged, it is often helpful if a back-up plan for alternative access is also discussed within the multidisciplinary team, and this is consistent with the KDIGO concept of a 'life plan' for vascular access.

Stenosis

Significant AV access circuit stenosis can manifest broadly as disorders of inflow (presenting with needling difficulty, inability to achieve flow or inadequate dialysis) or of outflow (presenting with arm swelling, prolonged needle site bleeding or inadequate dialysis). Flow dysfunction may therefore be problematic immediately, leading to symptoms and treatment burden, but importantly also it leads to a cumulative risk of access thrombosis, a serious event which leads to further treatment burden (unplanned admission, temporary access), clinical risk (delayed dialysis) and sometimes loss of access: thrombectomy is not always attempted, not always successful, and recurrent thrombosis is common.

The pathophysiology of AV access circuit stenosis is incompletely understood, involving fibromuscular proliferation and neointimal hyperplasia, thought to be driven by flow turbulence and wall shear stress. Angiography is usually the initial step since it combines accurate anatomic diagnosis with concurrent treatment, being therefore logical and convenient, and with advances in endovascular techniques these are now the mainstay of management.

### Nonmaturing fistulae: epidemiology, possible interventions, and outcomes [^115jUZQ6]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Autogenous arteriovenous fistulae are the best method for prolonged, successful dialysis access. However, a substantial limitation of dialysis fistulae is their high primary failure rate, estimated to be as high as 70% for radiocephalic fistulae. Fistula maturation is influenced by demographic risk factors as well as anatomical barriers, the latter of which can be readily identified by noninvasive ultrasound imaging and physical examination. These barriers can be categorized as inflow problems (native arterial disease, arteriovenous anastomotic stenosis, and juxta-anastomotic stenosis) or outflow problems (proximal venous stenosis or collateral veins). Venous stenoses represent the most commonly observed barrier to fistula maturation. By treating these barriers with a systematic approach, interventionalists can significantly improve the likelihood of a fistula's usability for dialysis.

### Arteriovenous fistulas and their characteristic sites of stenosis [^114TXUkV]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

In the United States, more than 250,000 patients with end-stage renal disease are dialyzed through arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs). The three most common AVFs are the radiocephalic fistula, the brachiocephalic fistula, and the brachial artery-to-transposed basilic vein fistula. Although many potential access site stenoses can and do occur within any given fistula, each fistula has a characteristic site of stenosis. This article will discuss the characteristic site of stenosis for each type of fistula including the effects of stenosis at that site on fistula function, and their treatment.

Conclusion

The characteristic sites of stenosis in AVFs used for dialysis share in common significant angulation, which likely causes stenosis by leading to turbulent flow and intimal injury. While balloon dilation is considered first-line therapy, further interventions such as stent placement or surgical revision are sometimes needed to treat these recalcitrant areas of stenosis.

### Safety and performance of a cell-impermeable endoprosthesis for hemodialysis vascular access outflow stenosis: a Brazilian multicenter retrospective study [^1131ELgk]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

To ensure proper anchoring and contact with the vessel wall, the cell-impermeable endoprosthesis was placed in a 10–25% oversized configuration within the distal segment of the stenosis (compared to the adjacent healthy segment). This configuration included ≥ 1 cm overlap with the healthy vessel or synthetic graft. Devices were then post-dilated using a balloon, with the balloon size not exceeding the diameter of the device. After the procedure, patients were administered antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy. Two centers administered both aspirin and clopidogrel (60 days at one center; 30 days at another), whereas the other two centers exclusively prescribed a 30-day course of either aspirin or clopidogrel.

Physical examinations were scheduled at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-procedure, with additional visits arranged as needed to address any issues related to access circuit dysfunction. Follow-up times enabled comprehensive assessments during the interval when conventional interventions tend to fail.

Physical examinations and dialysis parameters evaluated included the presence of thrill, prolonged bleeding, elevated venous pressure, pulsatility, difficulties in needle cannulation, and inadequacy of the hemodialysis session — identified by low Kt/V values, where values are determined by urea volume clearance (K) during the dialysis session (t) divided by the distribution volume of urea (V), as well as observations for edema in the hand, arm, neck, and trunk. Assessments were conducted to detect any discomfort associated with the dialysis circuit, respiratory and neurological symptoms, skin condition changes, and adverse effects. If a patient presented with symptoms of dysfunction during the physical examination, and a new stenosis or restenosis was suspected, a Duplex ultrasound or angiogram was performed to confirm the diagnosis.

Study Outcome Measures

Study measures included patient characteristics, access failure causes, access patency, need for reintervention, proper access functioning, factors predicting procedure success, complication rates, and mortality rates.

Clinical outcomes were retrospectively evaluated 12 months following device placement. The primary and secondary study outcome measures are listed in Table 1; definitions of study measures align with the Society of Interventional Radiology reporting standards.

### Quantification of the severity of outflow stenosis of hemodialysis fistulas with a pulse-and thrill-based scoring system [^117DWXXZ]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

We performed an observational case-control study by analyzing data prospectively collected between June 2019 and December 2019. During the study period, arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) were treated and followed up in accordance with our routine protocols. A written informed consent was obtained from each participant included in the study. Altogether, 84 patients who were referred to our institution for treatment of vascular access sites were enrolled in the study. The patients' electronic imaging and medical records were reviewed after approval was obtained from the institutional review board of our hospital.

The inclusion criteria were 1) a mature AVF (> 6 months old) with pulsatile AVF outflow detected on the finger pad at the palpation site; 2) the AVF was superficial and visible at least 10 cm downstream from the venous cannulation segment; 3) the AVF was symptomatic and the patient had been referred to us because of high dynamic intra-access pressure (> 180–200 mmHg) during dialysis or prolonged needle-site bleeding after dialysis; 4) the AVF was asymptomatic and the patient had been referred to us for treatment because PE suggested the presence of access outflow stenosis, on the basis of high pulsatility upon finger compression, a water-hammer or "angry" pulse, and/or discontinuous (systolic only) or no background thrill/bruit.

The exclusion criteria were 1) an AVF that had failed to mature; 2) an AVF with outflow that was deep and invisible or was difficult to palpate because of an interposed graft, stent graft, or heavy calcification; 3) an AVF without a main trunk (e.g. Gracz's fistula, eighth-note deformity); and 4) an AVF for which the pulsation was weak or absent upon palpation when the AVF-bearing arm was elevated.

Arteriovenous fistula background — AVF maturation failure remains an important clinical problem for HD patients, with observational studies reporting a range from 20% to 60%. A multicenter randomized controlled trial in the United States reported that up to 60% of AVFs created failed to mature successfully for dialysis use. Prior guidance recommended a PTA or surgical revision in an AVF with greater than 50% stenosis in either the venous outflow or arterial inflow, in conjunction with clinical or physiologic abnormalities.

Hemodialysis access outflow stenosis may be diagnosed by palpating the area around the access during a physical examination (PE) and finding hyper-pulsation against a background of continuous, systolic thrill. However, this thrill is not apparent when the outflow stenosis is severe. The arm elevation test can also be utilized to detect outflow stenosis. When the AVF-bearing arm is elevated to a level above that of the heart, and if there is no significant outflow stenosis, the AVF should collapse, at least partially, due to the effect of gravity. However, if there is significant outflow stenosis, the portion of the AVF downstream of the stenosis will collapse, while the portion upstream of the stenosis will remain distended (failure to collapse). In our daily practice, when performing the arm elevation test, we not only observe collapsibility of the access outflow, but also palpate it to identify a background thrill, which sometimes disappears with the arm at rest, only to reappear when the arm is elevated, which possibly reflects gravity-related flow acceleration. If, upon arm elevation, there is no thrill, we assume that the outflow stenosis is too severe to allow gravity to accelerate the outflow of blood, and we refer to this condition as "physical examination significant outflow stenosis" (PESOS). In the present study, we aimed to characterize PESOS anatomically and hemodynamically, including the associated anatomical percentage stenosis and hemodynamic derangement, via Doppler measurement of the flow.

### Hemodialysis fistula stenosis caused by extrinsic vascular compression: the May-Thurner of fistulas [^113DsFoq]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Medium credibility.

Significant venous outflow stenosis of a forearm arteriovenous fistulae caused by an extrinsic vascular compression is a very rare entity (no reported cases in the literature). We report a case of high venous pressures during dialysis, secondary to an extrinsic compression of the underlying brachial artery that was diagnosed with Doppler ultrasound. The stenosis localization resembles the typical and frequent juxta-anastomotic venous outflow stenosis. This similarity can be a confounding factor and can lead to failure of conventional treatments. Careful surgical technique of arteriovenous graft creation and Doppler ultrasound mapping can prevent this entity.

Rationale

Central venous stenosis (CVS) is defined as pathological narrowing or occlusion in one or more of the thoracic veins: subclavian, brachiocephalic (innominate) or superior vena cava (SVC), with simplified central venous anatomy illustrated in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
Simplified anatomy of central veins, leading from neck and arms, back to the heart

Although it may cause symptoms, such as arm swelling following fistula creation, the clinical importance of CVS is largely due to its effect on access function, both success rates and durability. This effect on dialysis access is variable, but severe CVS limits access options, by occluding the necessary outflow for successful AV access formation, and preventing catheter placement: in a minority of cases SVC territory access is no longer possible (see Sect. 4, below). Even when asymptomatic CVS is a hidden cause of access failure, as perhaps best demonstrated in Shingarev's report of outcomes after fistula formation in 233 patients with a previous dialysis catheter. Comparing patients according to whether the prior catheter was contralateral or ipsilateral to the fistula, although there was no difference in initial fistula success, an ipsilateral prior catheter was clearly associated with shorter secondary patency (HR 2.48, 95%CI 1.33–7.33, p = 0.009).

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this review will be to summarize recent concepts pertaining to the pathophysiology of dialysis access stenosis and to then use this information to highlight novel interventions (both diagnostic and therapeutic) for dialysis access dysfunction. The studies covered in this review will include experimental and observational studies in addition to clinical trials.

Recent Findings

An important biological focus of this review will be an emphasis on the role of the adventitia and progenitor cells in the pathogenesis of dialysis access dysfunction. The main interventional focus will be on access surveillance, local drug delivery and other novel therapeutic interventions. An important underlying theme throughout this review will be an emphasis on arteriovenous fistulae and on the many advantages of local therapeutic interventions in the specific clinical setting of dialysis access dysfunction.

Summary

Vascular access dysfunction remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for hemodialysis patients. We believe that a better understanding of the biological mechanisms of vascular access stenosis will help guide the development of novel therapies to prevent and treat dialysis access stenosis.

Access flow for dialysis in fistulae (CPG 3.3) notes that after appropriate physical examination, a fistulogram is the gold standard for evaluating poor maturation if the patient is already on dialysis therapy, while for those not yet on dialysis therapy use of a non-nephrotoxic contrast material, carbon dioxide, or ultrasound should be used; delivery of dialysis is flow dependent, with access flow less than 350 mL/min likely to produce recirculation and inadequate delivery of dialysis. Some centers have used diluted contrast (25%), acceptable images can be obtained, and interventions may include PTA of stenotic lesions, ligation or occlusion of vein branches if the problem is simply > 1 major outflow vein, and/or surgical revision of the anastomosis.

Vascular access — surveillance and stenosis assessment in AVFs emphasize that surveillance findings can be observer dependent and an abnormal isolated finding should be supported by abnormal physical symptoms; persistence of abnormal physical findings and surveillance test results requires further diagnostic steps and timely treatment. Repeated failure to deliver the prescribed dialysis dose by using an AVF should result in immediate evaluation. Stenosis grading is by percentage narrowing using the immediately upstream or downstream normal vessel as reference, which can be difficult when the AVF is irregular or aneurysmal or at the confluence of 2 vessels, and severity can also be graded by the drop-off in systolic or mean pressure across the stenosis.

Introduction

The arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is often touted as the "lifeline" for dialysis patients. According to the National Kidney Foundation (NKF), vascular access is globally ranked as a top priority for dialysis patients, healthcare providers, and clinical research. Preserving dialysis access is a high priority for providers and patients because the consequences of AVF dysfunction and subsequent access failure significantly contributes to patient morbidity and healthcare costs. Unfortunately, AVF dysfunction is not uncommon. One 5-year study from 2018 that analyzed AVF failures found a cumulative patency loss rate of 19.7% and 33.3% during the early and late period, respectively. According to the United States Renal Data System (USRDS), from 2016–2018, the cumulative incidence of loss of primary unassisted patency at 1 year was 51.8%, the loss of primary assisted patency was 19.0%, and the loss of secondary patency was 3.3%. It is well documented that the most common cause of AVF dysfunction and subsequent failure is stenosis and thrombosis –. One study found that the incidence of stenosis is 4.6–10.8%, and the incidence of thrombosis is 2.3–7.7%. Nearly all thrombosed AVFs have an underlying stenotic lesion. While patients on hemodialysis are in a general prothrombotic state, which increases the risk for stroke and ischemic heart disease, studies have found that vascular access-related complications are the leading cause of hospitalizations among dialysis patients. Once there is access site thrombosis, urgent intervention is required for salvage in order to prevent permanent loss of the AVF.

Vascular access complications, such as stenosis and thrombosis, are significant drivers of resource utilization, cost, morbidity, and mortality –. Screening for AVF stenosis improves the longevity of AVFs, reduce costs for healthcare systems, and improve the quality of life for patients. The current Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines recommend screening for AVF stenosis through "the examination and evaluation of the access by means of physical examination to detect clinical signs that suggest the presence of AV access flow dysfunction". A lesion is considered clinically significant if it contributes to clinical signs and symptoms, such as arm swelling, prolonged bleeding after dialysis, or changes in the access bruit (rumbling sound) or thrill (tactile sensation); regardless of sustained changes in measurements such as access flow or venous pressures –.

Arteriovenous hemodialysis access — poor venous outflow and early anastomotic stenosis management is guided by surveillance and targeted revision: after an autogenous access is placed, a policy of aggressive re-evaluation should be performed to maintain function, and Revision of a functioning autogenous access to a more proximal arterial and venous location is another strategy to optimize usable segments. Early anastomotic stenoses causing poor outflow should be addressed based on timing: When diagnosed ≤ 7 days of access construction, surgical revision should be performed. When such stenoses are diagnosed later, balloon angioplasty can be performed initially. Procedural safety is emphasized: Care must be taken when approaching the arterial anastomosis. Arterial embolization can result from clot fragmentation or dislodgement of the arterial plug, and intimal dissection can occur from vessel damage caused by the wire or thrombectomy device.

Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) aneurysm definitions and clinical implications are summarized as follows: an AVF aneurysm has been defined as enlargement of all 3 vessel layers with a diameter of > 18 mm or roughly 3 times the diameter of the outflow vein of a mature AVF; aneurysms can occur anywhere in the AV access circuit but typically occur in the outflow vein; pseudoaneurysms usually arise from repeated cannulations and, although they develop in AVFs, are more common in arteriovenous grafts (AVGs); most aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms are asymptomatic but can compromise function and cause life‑threatening hemorrhage, with AV access–related fatal hemorrhage reported as 1 for every 1,000 patient-years; diagnosis is by physical examination corroborated with Duplex ultrasound, which can detect per- access fluid, intraluminal thrombus, and inflow/outflow stenoses and quantitate diameter and intra-access flow; it is critical to determine if the lesion is symptomatic and/or at risk for ulceration and rupture, and it is important to have routine, objective measures of growth with greater frequency if worrisome signs or symptoms develop.

Arteriovenous fistulas

The AV fistula is considered the best long-term vascular access for haemodialysis because it provides adequate blood flow, is long-lasting and has a lower complication rate than other types of access. A nephrologist or surgeon creates an AV fistula. As a result, the vein grows larger and stronger, making repeated needle insertions for haemodialysis treatments easier. AV fistulas also present some disvantages, including the incomplete maturation of the vein, and a 1–4-month period may be required before the AV fistula can be used. Fistula dysfunction is the most common reason for a second intervention and recurrent hospitalisation. The rate of AVF complications increases with age and the erythropoietin dose as well as among patients with a history of a previous failed shunt. The clinical symptoms include poor flow with loss of thrill in the graft, enlarging pseudoaneurysm or ipsilateral limb swelling.

The main complications of AV fistula include thrombosis with occlusion or stenosis of the venous outflow (Fig. 13a, c) as well as aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm of the venous tract (Fig. 14a, c) close or distal to the anastomosis with the radial artery. In particular, the venous outflow obstruction is the most common cause of AVF thrombosis and poor dialysis. Most typically, pseudoaneurysms are found in areas of repeated puncture or surgical anastomosis.

Complications of the arterial tract of AVFs are rare. Proximal arterial disease, the occlusion or arterial anastomotic stenosis are readily shown by digital subtraction angiography. The arterial stenosis appears as a narrowed area adjacent to or between areas of graft ectasia. The laceration of the radial artery may determine a haematoma with compression of the nervous structures in the carpal tunnel.

Evaluation of early and late complications: B-mode and Doppler criteria of stenosis

Venous stenosis may be either an early or a late complication of fistula, and it is the most common cause of access failure and dialysis inadequacy. The VA stenosis alters regional hemodynamic and may causes access flow volume decline, followed by recirculation ⩾12%, reduction of Kt/V ratio, high venous pressure (> 200 mmHg), thrill reduction, and post-dialytic bleeding. More proximal outflow vein stenosis increases the venous pressure and could lead to hand edema. In newly fistulas, the juxta-anastomotic stenosis in inflow or outflow is primarily caused by venous neointimal hyperplasia and inward vascular remodeling (venous constriction) stimulated by endothelial inflammatory-like pathways due to shear stress variations.

PTA has become the current standard treatment of this complication despite the stenosis relapses. Adequate surveillance with PWD imaging allows early diagnosis of the venous stenosis and proper selection of the cases referred to procedure. Defining morphological and hemodynamic criteria of stenosis at ultrasound is currently challenging because of the lack of standardized values and procedures. The increase of the peak systolic velocity (PSV) and diastolic velocity in stenotic segments (juxta-anastomotic and distal segment of the outflow vein in the native fistula, venous anastomosis of prosthetic graft), spectral broadening, and artifacts such as aliasing and perivascular color bruit are the typical signs of stenosis.

Arterial stenosis represents only 8% of all vascular access stenosis. It is associated with age-related diseases and may be suspected when PSV values in the radial artery are greater than 200 cm/s (compared with the upstream segment of the vessel — PSV ratio > 2–2.5). Conversely, the diagnosis of draining vein stenosis is more difficult. In this case, a segmental increase in the PSV (> 300 cm/s) in the vein is to be considered critical if the increase of PSV is associated with a reduction of blood flow rate in the brachial artery (< 500 ml/m or fall of 25% in the last month when the blood flow rate is < 1000 ml/min). PWD measurements compared to venography have shown an overall sensitivity ranging from 87% and 100% and specificity between 85% and 97%. Considering that PTA is the choice treatment for stenosis and obstruction of VA and that the costs related to the administration of repeated PTA and drug-eluting/coated balloon are elevated, more trials are needed to define parameters and indications of the therapeutic procedures.

Inadequate flow (CPG 5.2) management — A primary fistula should be revised when it is unable to sustain adequate hemodialysis (HD) blood flow, manifested by the inability to achieve the prescribed Kt/V within a reasonable HD duration. In case of reduced flow caused by arterial inflow, 2 therapeutic options exist: interventional angioplasty or surgical revision for stenosis of the feeding artery, or a more proximally located new AV anastomosis when the feeding artery is inadequate; for correcting stenoses, PTA is a safe and effective technique with a low rate of reintervention. Reported arterial inflow lesion frequencies include Four of 40 patients with brachial artery lesions contributing to access dysfunction and 41 of 101 fistulae with arterial inflow lesions at the time of therapeutic intervention for dysfunction.

### Salvage of a severely dysfunctional arteriovenous fistula with a strictured and occluded outflow tract [^112AExjJ]. Seminars in Dialysis (2005). Low credibility.

Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) created for the purpose of hemodialysis are frequently lost due to various vascular lesions. Endovascular therapies with percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty have become very valuable in treating AVF dysfunction due to vascular stenosis. Experience with these therapies is relatively limited. In this case report, we present a patient with a severely dysfunctional AVF. The vascular lesions affecting his AVF were numerous and severe. We show how the application of aggressive endovascular treatment succeeded in restoring use of his AVF. Throughout the discussion we share observations and personal experiences that may be useful for interventionalists and health care practitioners involved with the maintenance, use, and treatment of dialysis vascular accesses.

### Measuring the palpable pulsatility length as a physical examination test in defining the severity of inflow stenosis for hemodialysis fistulas [^112eFBsx]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

We agree with the contention that whether to treat a stenosis should be based on its hemodynamic impact on the AVF rather than the percentage narrowing detected by angiography. The gold standard for assessing the hemodynamic impact of a stenosis is to measure the volumetric flow rate of AVF (Qa) by the ultrasonic dilution technique. Tessitore et al. proposed that the optimal tests for identifying an inflow stenosis are Qa < 650 mL/min combined with a positive PE or Qa < 650 mL/min alone. However, given that Transonic hemodialysis monitors are not widely available in dialysis units, the augmentation test has been the only available tool that have been reported as useful for assessing AVF inflow problems.

In this study, we defined an inflow stenosis incurring a hemodynamical derangement estimated by PPL < 11.0 cm and/or API < 1.29 as a critical inflow stenosis. A symptomatic critical inflow stenosis was of no doubt needed a treatment, however, is it justified to treat an asymptomatic critical inflow stenosis? We analyzed the angiograms of those AVFs with asymptomatic critical inflow stenosis (the false positive results; Figs. 1a, b and 6, we found these asymptomatic critical inflow stenoses had very similar severity of stenosis with those symptomatic ones. Tessitore et al. reported that active blood flow surveillance and pre-emptive repair of subclinical stenosis reduce the thrombosis rate and prolong the functional life of mature AVFs. Therefore, in our opinion, we think it is justifiable to treat asymptomatic critical inflow stenosis and it is currently our routine practice.

Detection of access dysfunction — fistula hemodynamics and surveillance implications using PIA/MAP are outlined: In fistulae, blood entering the venous system returns through multiple collateral veins; as a consequence, PIA/MAP in a fistula is, on average, less than in a graft and may not increase with outlet stenosis, so the test theoretically is less valuable as a surveillance tool for stenosis in fistulae; however, most elbow-level fistulae do not have or lose collaterals and often behave hemodynamically like grafts; in both fistula types, elevation of PIA/MAP indicates venous outflow stenosis and is associated with an increased probability of access failure or need for revision to provide adequate blood flow for hemodialysis (HD).

### Clinical practice guidelines for vascular access [^115jLD2G]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Detection of access dysfunction: monitoring, surveillance, and diagnostic testing — in hemodialysis access, dynamic venous pressure (DVP) at flows of 150 to 225 mL/min has limited or absent utility to predict stenosis or thrombosis in grafts, while flow measurements, duplex Doppler ultrasound (DDU) assessment for stenosis, and static pressure measurements can detect hemodynamically significant stenosis in grafts and fistulae. The Work Group believes there is insufficient evidence to suggest 1 surveillance technique as "preferred" or "acceptable". Recirculation is described as a relatively late predictor of access dysfunction and, if used, has a minor role in fistulae only, and non–urea-based recirculation measurements are very accurate but require specialized devices. Unexplained decreases in delivered dialysis dose measured by Kt/V or urea reduction ratio (URR) frequently are associated with venous outflow stenoses, but many other factors influence Kt/V and URR, making them less sensitive and less specific for detecting access dysfunction.

### Can blood flow surveillance and pre-emptive repair of subclinical stenosis prolong the useful life of arteriovenous fistulae? A randomized controlled study [^111iWu49]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Stenosis is the main cause of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) failure. It is unclear, however, if surveillance for stenosis enhances AVF function and longevity and if there is an ideal time for intervention.

Methods

In a 5-year randomized, controlled, open trial we compared blood flow surveillance and pre-emptive repair of subclinical stenoses (one or both of angioplasty and open surgery) with standard monitoring and intervention based upon clinical criteria alone to determine if the former prolonged the longevity of mature forearm AVFs. Surveillance with blood pump flow (Qb) monitoring during dialysis sessions and quarterly shunt blood flow (Qa) or recirculation measurements identified 79 AVFs with angiographically proven, significant (> 50%) stenosis. The AVFs were randomized to either a control group (intervention done in response to a decline in the delivered dialysis dose or thrombosis; n = 36) or to a pre-emptive treatment group (n = 43). To evaluate a possible relationship between outcome and haemodynamic status of the access, AVFs were divided into functional and failing subgroups, according to Qa values higher or lower than 350 ml/min or the absence or presence of recirculation.

Results

A Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that pre-emptive treatment reduced failure rate (P = 0.003) and the Cox hazards model identified treatment (P = 0.009) and higher baseline Qa (P = 0.001) as the only variables associated with favourable outcome. Primary patency rates were higher in treatment than in control AVFs in both functional (P = 0.021) and failing subgroups (P = 0.005). They were also higher in functional than in failing AVFs in both control (P < 0.001) and treatment groups (P = 0.023). Access survival was significantly higher in pre-emptively treated than in control AVFs (P = 0.050), a higher post-intervention Qa being the only variable associated with improved access longevity (P = 0.044). Secondary patency rates were similar in pre-emptively treated and control AVFs in both functional (P = 0.059) and failing subgroups (P = 0.394). They were also similar in functional and failing AVFs in controls (P = 0.082), but were higher in pre-emptively treated functional AVFs than in pre-emptively treated failing AVFs (P = 0.033) or in the entire control group (P = 0.019).

Conclusions

We provide evidence that active blood flow surveillance and pre-emptive repair of subclinical stenosis reduce the thrombosis rate and prolong the functional life of mature forearm AVFs. We also show that Qa is a crucial indicator of access patency and a Qa > 350 ml/min portends a superior outcome with pre-emptive action in AVFs.

### Diagnosis of arteriovenous fistula dysfunction [^114jGJaf]. Seminars in Dialysis (2012). Low credibility.

Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) dysfunction remains a major contributor to the morbidity and mortality of hemodialysis patients. The failure of a newly created AVF to mature and development of stenosis in an established AVF are two common clinical predicaments. The goal is to identify a dysfunctional AVF early enough to intervene in a timely manner to either assist with the maturation process or to prevent thrombosis. The currently available tools in our armamentarium include clinical evaluation, physical examination of the AVF, and surveillance tests. Physical examination has been recognized as a simple and cost-effective tool, but is often not implemented either because of lack of training or time constraints. Surveillance tests include measurement of access flow or pressure as a surrogate marker of AVF dysfunction. Surveillance tests often require expensive equipment, additional personnel, and are controversial. Currently, there are guidelines and recommendations to include all of these measures while evaluating an AVF. Implementing judicious use of these tools in clinical practice can facilitate early diagnosis for timely intervention in the appropriate population. Furthermore, this strategy may avoid unnecessary interventions and assist with healthcare cost containment.

### In search of an optimal bedside screening program for arteriovenous fistula stenosis [^11518Pnu]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Guidelines recommend systematically screening for stenosis using various methods, but no studies so far have compared all of the options. A prospective blinded study was performed to compare the performance of several bedside tests performed during dialysis in diagnosing angiographically proven > 50% fistula stenosis.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

In an unselected population of 119 hemodialysis patients with mature fistulas, physical examination (PE) was conducted; dynamic and derived static venous pressure (VAPR), blood pump flow/arterial pressure (Qb/AP) ratio, recirculation (R), and access blood flow (Qa) were measured; and angiography was performed.

Results

Angiography identified 59 stenotic fistulas: 43 stenoses were located upstream from the venous needle (inflow stenosis), 12 were located downstream (outflow stenosis), and 4 were located at both sites. The optimal tests for identifying an inflow stenosis were Qa < 650 ml/min and the combination of a positive PE "or" Qa < 650 ml/min (accuracy 80% and 81%, respectively), the latter being preferable because it was more sensitive (85% versus 65%, respectively) for a comparable specificity (79% versus 89%, respectively). The best tests for identifying outflow stenosis were PE and VAPR, with no difference between the two (accuracy 91% and 85%, sensitivity 75% and 81%, specificity 93% and 86%, respectively), the former being preferable because it was more reproducible, easier to perform, and applicable to all fistulas.

Conclusions

This study showed that fistula stenosis can be detected and located during dialysis with a moderate-to-excellent accuracy using PE and Qa measurement as screening procedures.

### Swing segment stenosis: an unresolved challenge [^114bQ88F]. Seminars in Dialysis (2022). Medium credibility.

The native arteriovenous fistula is considered the gold standard among all dialysis access options. Compared with alternatives such as grafts and central venous catheters, their use is associated with a lower risk of infective and thrombotic complications. This leads to better patient outcomes and reduced healthcare-associated costs. Recognizing these advantages, there is a global drive to increase the creation and use of such fistulas in hemodialysis patients. Swing segment stenosis is a common problem encountered with the creation and use of these fistulas that can hurt their maturation and longevity. A "swing segment" in an arteriovenous fistula is defined as a segment of vein that pursues a sharp, curved course. Due to poorly understood reasons, these swing segments tend to develop stenotic lesions that are extremely challenging to treat. This review aims to provide an overview of the pathophysiology, incidence, management, and prevention of these swing segment lesions. We believe that such knowledge will be useful for clinicians who deal with dialysis access creation and maintenance.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery: clinical practice guidelines for the surgical placement and maintenance of arteriovenous hemodialysis access [^112dzhrE]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Medium credibility.

Arteriovenous access late thrombosis and intimal hyperplasia — lesion patterns and evaluation differ by access type: Prosthetic accesses have a much higher incidence of thrombosis and the access-specific stenotic lesion is more predictably found in a specific location, at the prosthetic venous anastomosis, whereas in autogenous accesses the stenosis can be located anywhere along the access vein used for needle puncture, and multiple stenoses are often present, and both can have stenoses along the venous outflow tract, including central veins on the same side. Because arterial lesions also contribute, evaluation of the arterial inflow from the central arteries to the artery providing inflow to the access is indicated if a venous etiology cannot be found or the quality of the arterial inflow is in question. Regarding prosthetic access failure pathophysiology, In > 90% of cases, prosthetic accesses failure is due to stenosis of the venous anastomosis, draining vein, or central vein.

### Pre-emptive correction for haemodialysis arteriovenous access stenosis [^115RFSqz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend routine arteriovenous (AV) graft and fistula surveillance (technology-based screening) in addition to clinical monitoring (physical examination) for early identification and pre-emptive correction of a stenosis before the access becomes dysfunctional. However, consequences on patient-relevant outcomes of pre-emptive correction of a stenosis in a functioning access as opposed to deferred correction, i.e. correction postponed to when the access becomes dysfunctional, are uncertain.

Objectives

We aimed to evaluate 1) whether pre-emptive correction of an AV access stenosis improves clinically relevant outcomes; 2) whether the effects of pre-emptive correction of an AV access stenosis differ by access type (fistula versus graft), aim (primary and secondary prophylaxis), and surveillance method for primary prophylaxis (Doppler ultrasound for the screening of functional and anatomical changes versus measurement of the flow in the access); and 3) whether other factors (dialysis duration, access location, configuration or materials, algorithm for referral for intervention, intervention strategies (surgical versus radiological or other), or study design) explain the heterogeneity that might exist in the effect estimates.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 30 November 2015 using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

We included all studies of any access surveillance method for early identification and pre-emptive treatment of an AV access stenosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data on potentially remediable and irremediable failure of the access (i.e. thrombosis and access loss respectively); infection and mortality; and resource use (hospitalisation, diagnostic and intervention procedures). Analysis was by a random effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR), hazard ratio (HR) or incidence rate ratio (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We identified 14 studies (1390 participants), nine enrolled adults without a known access stenosis (primary prophylaxis; three studies including people using fistulas) and five enrolled adults with a documented stenosis in a non-dysfunctional access (secondary prophylaxis; three studies in people using fistulas). Study follow-up ranged from 6 to 38 months, and study size ranged from 58 to 189 participants. In low- to moderate-quality evidence (based on GRADE criteria) in adults treated with haemodialysis, relative to no surveillance and deferred correction, surveillance with pre-emptive correction of an AV stenosis reduced the risk of thrombosis (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.97; I² = 30%; 18 study comparisons, 1212 participants), but had imprecise effect on the risk of access loss (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.02; I² = 0%; 11 study comparisons, 972 participants). In analyses subgrouped by access type, pre-emptive stenosis correction did not reduce the risk of thrombosis (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.12; I² = 0%; 11 study comparisons, 697 participants) or access loss in grafts (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.15; I² = 0%; 7 study comparisons; 662 participants), but did reduce the risk of thrombosis (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.71; I² = 0%; 7 study comparisons, 515 participants) and the risk of access loss in fistulas (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.86; I² = 0%; 4 studies; 310 participants). Three of the four studies reporting access loss data in fistulas (199 participants) were conducted in the same centre. Insufficient data were available to assess whether benefits vary by prophylaxis aim in fistulas (i.e. primary and secondary prophylaxis). Although the magnitude of the effects of pre-emptive stenosis correction was considerable for patient-centred outcomes, results were either heterogeneous or imprecise. While pre-emptive stenosis correction may reduce the rates of hospitalisation (IRR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.93; I² = 67%; 4 study comparisons, 219 participants) and use of catheters (IRR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.98; I² = 53%; 6 study comparisons, 394 participants), it may also increase the rates of diagnostic procedures (IRR 1.78, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.67; I² = 62%; 7 study comparisons, 539 participants), infection (IRR 1.74, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.91; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 248 participants) and mortality (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.11; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 386 participants). In general, risk of bias was high or unclear in most studies for many domains we assessed. Four studies were published after 2005 and only one had evidence of registration within a trial registry. No study reported information on authorship and/or involvement of the study sponsor in data collection, analysis, and interpretation.

Authors' Conclusions

Pre-emptive correction of a newly identified or known stenosis in a functional AV access does not improve access longevity. Although pre-emptive stenosis correction may be promising in fistulas existing evidence is insufficient to guide clinical practice and health policy. While pre-emptive stenosis correction may reduce the risk of hospitalisation, this benefit is uncertain whereas there may be a substantial increase (i.e. 80%) in the use of access-related procedures and procedure-related adverse events (e.g. infection, mortality). The net effects of pre-emptive correction on harms and resource use are thus unclear.

### Stenosis complicating vascular access for hemodialysis: indications for treatment [^116m5DKw]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of the multidisciplinary team committed to the care of vascular access (VA) for hemodialysis is to prolong as much as possible the functional patency of the access. Stenosis is definitely the most frequent complication of arteriovenous VA. Whereas the best surveillance strategy is still a matter of debate, some evidence is now available about treatment indication and options. The available body of evidence on the best strategy facing this complication of VA is reviewed.

Maintenance of hemodialysis access for end-stage renal disease continues to be a major challenge for vascular surgeons, nephrologists, and primary care physicians. This case report highlights the complication and treatment of lower extremity central venous stenosis, allowing continued dialysis access for a patient with limited remaining fistula options. This stenosis resulted from the prolonged use of a lower extremity central venous catheter. This case highlights the importance of imaging the central veins in obstruction of lower extremity fistulas. Once detected, as in the upper extremity, this can be effectively treated using balloon dilation and stenting.

### Clinical practice guidelines for vascular access [^116quy5s]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis vascular access surveillance — grafts and fistulae: An initially well-functioning graft with an access flow approaching 2 L/min (usually in the upper arm) decreases in flow as venous outflow stenosis progresses, with hemodynamic simulations showing flow decreases by less than 20% until a 40% to 50% decrease in luminal diameter, after which flow decreases rapidly as stenosis increases to 80%. Because the intimal hyperplasia process progresses with time, its detection requires sequential measurements of flow or pressure or both to detect a threshold at which action should be taken. Access recirculation in grafts is a late manifestation and a poor predictor, occurring in less than 20% of cases, and for this reason, the strong recommendation is made to avoid using recirculation measurements in grafts. In fistulae, recirculation occurs more frequently, with one study reporting about one third with significant recirculation using ultrasound dilution. When measured by the Fresenius Body Thermal Monitor (BTM), detection of fistulae requiring revision had a sensitivity of 81.8% and specificity of 98.6%, though the BTM method does not differentiate access from cardiopulmonary recirculation.

### Con: vascular access surveillance in mature fistulas: is it worthwhile? [^113bY9w4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

The risks and benefits of hemodialysis arteriovenous (AV) access surveillance have been debated since the introduction of AV access surveillance techniques. The debate is fuelled by the lack of robust, high-quality evidence with consistent and comparable patient-important outcomes. Additionally, there is a lack of clarity regarding the diagnostic cut points for AV access stenosis using the various surveillance techniques, questions about the appropriateness of the 'knee-jerk' response to intervention on a stenosis > 50% regardless of the presence of clinical indicators and whether the intervention results in desired patient-important outcomes. The physiology of the AV access is complex considering the different hemodynamics within an AV fistula, which vary by time of dialysis, location, size of vessels and location of the stenosis. The current evidence suggests that the use of AV access surveillance in an AV fistula does detect more stenosis compared with clinical monitoring alone and leads to an increased number of procedures. It remains uncertain if that leads to improved patient-important outcomes such as prolonged AV fistula patency. Vascular access is an essential component of hemodialysis and further study is needed to clarify this long-standing debate. There needs to be better distinction between the strategies of vascular access surveillance, clinical monitoring with clinical indictors and preemptive intervention and their respective impacts on patient-important outcomes. Randomized controlled studies must be conducted with defined indications for intervention, reproducible methods of intervention and clinically important AV fistula and patient outcomes. The current guidelines need to be challenged and revised to permit these necessary studies to be done.

### Quantification of the severity of outflow stenosis of hemodialysis fistulas with a pulse-and thrill-based scoring system [^11244FoQ]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

PE has long been an access monitoring tool, and its role is to detect or diagnose stenosis when access dysfunction occurs during hemodialysis. However, PE can only provide "yes" or "no" answers regarding whether there is stenosis in the vascular access circuit. Thus, PE findings cannot be used to quantify the severity of the stenosis and cannot be used as a surveillance tool, because a treatment threshold cannot be set on the basis of such findings. In the present study, as an abnormal PE finding, PESOS indicates ≥ 75% outflow stenosis with high diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, critical PESOS patients have even more severe outflow stenosis (≥ 82%). The diagnostic accuracies of PESOS and critical PESOS for the detection of stenosis were both superior to those of abnormal thrill and pulsatility, as shown in Table 1.

Table 1
The diagnostic accuracy of PE findings for the detection of AVF stenosis

PPV positive predictive value, NPV negative predictive value

In our opinion, the treatment of asymptomatic PESOS is beneficial for the prevention of unexpected AVF thrombosis. In addition, because the treatment threshold has been reset from > 50% to ≥ 75%, some premature interventions can be avoided and their costs saved. Because the presence of PESOS represents an indicator for treatment, PE therefore potentially represents a surveillance tool. Compared with other surveillance tools, such as a Transonic device, PE is the most cost-effective, because it is inexpensive and easy to perform.

The present study had some limitations. (1) It was a retrospective study with a small sample size. (2) Because it was a proof-of-concept study, only one vascular access nurse was assigned to perform all the PESOS scores, which is likely to limit the generalizability of the method. (3) The cost-effectiveness of preemptive treatment of an AVF using the PESOS condition as a treatment indicator needs further study. (4) The usefulness of the outflow score has not been tested for arteriovenous grafts and immature AVFs. (5) Inter-observer agreement regarding the outflow score was not assessed, and therefore further validation of the outflow score is required prior to its introduction into clinical practice.

### Association of risk stratification score with dialysis vascular access stenosis [^117AArHF]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Long-term vascular accesses used for hemodialysis develop frequent complications, such as loss of access patency or the ability to deliver adequate flow for dialysis. The rate of using arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and graft (AVG) in prevalent hemodialysis patients has plateaued. Improving the survival of arteriovenous dialysis accesses has remained a long-standing problem. The development of progressive vascular access stenosis with subsequent access failure contributes to significant morbidity of patients on dialysis as well as economic burden. Conversion from a permanent vascular access to a catheter increases mortality by 80%, and the incidence of primary AVF failures increases with each successive fistula placement. Therefore, early identification of progressive stenosis and prompt intervention to preclude access failure are essential for improving patient outcomes in a value-based reimbursement environment.

Hemodialysis vascular access complications are monitored by either direct clinical examination or a device-associated surveillance methodology. The 2019 update to the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Vascular Accessrecommends clinical monitoring as the standard to detect and correct stenosis and, in turn, to minimize or avoid dialysis interruption and to reduce the overall rate of thrombosis. This approach uses periodically observed clinical findings noted before initiating a dialysis treatment but fails to recognize that clinical monitoring is not standardized across different personnel (e.g. nurses and technicians), dialysis centers, and nations. Also, interpersonal and intrapersonal variability have not been well investigated. Any delay in identifying dysfunctional accesses can lead to complications like aneurysmal degeneration, thrombosis, and even catastrophic consequences like spontaneous rupture and death. –

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^1169vwgu]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Arteriovenous access flow dysfunction — monitoring/surveillance emphasizes that physical examination by an experienced individual has high sensitivity and specificity, is easily available, requires minimal training, is cost efficient, and takes minimal equipment and time, and has been used to detect access flow dysfunction (stenosis) in arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG). The value of physical examination is that if AV access flow dysfunction is suspected with appropriate matching clinical indicators, further investigation and preventive intervention (such as angioplasty) could be performed to improve outcomes, including preventing thrombosis. The rationale for surveillance is to detect and correct stenosis before the development of thrombosis to improve patency; clinical indicators include reduced dialysis clearance without other known cause, excessive bleeding after needle withdrawal, high venous and arterial pressures at the prescribed blood flow, and indicators on physical examination. Surveillance modalities studied include AV access flow (Qa) measurement by ultrasound dilution method (UDM) and duplex ultrasound to measure Qa and visualize anatomic abnormalities; dynamic and static venous pressure have also been used, with dynamic venous pressure measures now considered supplementary to clinical monitoring. Key questions posed address diagnostic value for detecting stenosis, validated surveillance thresholds (e.g. Qa, change in Qa/time) that accurately diagnose stenosis that will lead to future thrombosis, factors other than stenosis contributing to abnormal surveillance indicators, and appropriate intervention when stenosis is detected by surveillance in the absence of clinical indicators.

### Sonography of arteriovenous fistulas and grafts [^116GbT33]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) are the vascular accesses of choice for long-term hemodialysis. Strategies to establish and maintain functioning AVFs and AVGs are essential. In addition to clinical evaluation, ultrasound plays a critical role in the evaluation and maintenance of AVFs and AVGs. AVFs have a high rate of failure to mature which can be reliably diagnosed with ultrasound. Treatable etiologies of the failure to mature can often be diagnosed with ultrasound. Causes of secondary AVG failure can also be diagnosed with ultrasound and treated. AVGs have a relatively short functional life expectancy due to a high rate of AVG thrombosis. Ultrasound is a safe, noninvasive way to diagnose vascular stenosis in both AVFs and AVGs prior to thrombosis, potentially saving the access. Routine surveillance ultrasound of asymptomatic AVFs and AVGs is controversial with conflicting studies on its benefit. Routine surveillance ultrasound of AVFs and AVGs is not common practice.

### Quantification of the severity of outflow stenosis of hemodialysis fistulas with a pulse-and thrill-based scoring system [^117EqEwe]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Definitions

AVF outflow was the portion of an AVF that was downstream from the venous cannulation segment. The subclavian vein, innominate vein, and superior vena cava were not included. An abnormal thrill associated with outflow stenosis was defined as the presence of a discontinuous/systolic-only thrill or the absence of a thrill. An abnormal pulsation associated with outflow stenosis was defined as the presence of hyper-pulsation, a water-hammer pulse, or an angry pulse.

The AVF outflow score was derived as follows. Hyper-pulsation upon palpation is the basic PE finding when there is an AVF outflow stenosis. We hypothesized that the characteristics of the thrill that disappears upon palpation would change according to the increase in severity of the stenosis, in the following order: continuous thrill → discontinuous (systolic only) thrill → no thrill.

### Should current criteria for detecting and repairing arteriovenous fistula stenosis be reconsidered? Interim analysis of a randomized controlled trial [^113FDW9T]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The vascular access guidelines recommend that arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) with access dysfunction and an access blood flow (Qa) < 300–500 mL/min be referred for stenosis imaging and treatment. Significant (> 50%) stenosis, however, may be detected in a well-functioning AVF with a Qa > 500 mL/min, too, but whether it is worth correcting or not remains to be seen.

Methods

In October 2006, we began an open randomized controlled trial enrolling patients with an AVF with subclinical stenosis and Qa > 500 mL/min, to see how elective stenosis repair [treatment group (TX)] influenced access failure (thrombosis or impending thrombosis requiring access revision), or loss and the related cost compared with stenosis correction according to the guidelines, i.e. after the onset of access dysfunction or a Qa < 400 mL/min [control group (C)]. An interim analysis was performed in July 2012, by which time the trial had enrolled 58 patients (30 C and 28 TX).

Results

TX led to a relative risk of 0.47 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17–1.15] for access failure (P = 0.090), 0.37 [95% CI: 0.12–0.97] for thrombosis (P = 0.033) and 0.36 [95% CI: 0.09–0.99] for access loss (P = 0.041). In the setting of our study (in which all surgery was performed as in patient procedure) no significant differences in costs emerged between the two strategies. The mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for TX was €282 or €321 to avoid one episode of thrombosis or access loss, respectively.

Conclusions

Our interim analysis showed that elective repair of subclinical stenosis in AVFs with Qa > 500 mL/min cost-effectively reduces the risk of thrombosis and access loss in comparison with the approach of the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines, raising the question of whether the currently recommended criteria for assessing and treating stenosis should be reconsidered.

### Real-world outcomes of 600 drug-coated balloon angioplasties [^116CM28j]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The principal challenge in maintaining functional vascular access for hemodialysis is managing outflow stenoses, which are primarily caused by intimal hyperplasia. These stenoses are the leading cause of access dysfunction, leading to inadequate dialysis, increased morbidity, and frequent reinterventions. While drug-coated balloons (DCBs) have emerged as a promising solution by delivering antiproliferative agents to reduce restenosis rates, further clinical insights are needed to establish their role in vascular access management.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study analyzing 600 DCB angioplasties performed on 234 patients with stenoses or thromboses in arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) or vascular access grafts (AVGs). Central vein stenoses accounted for 17.5% of cases. Inclusion criteria comprised symptomatic or asymptomatic stenoses > 50% detected through Doppler ultrasound. DCBs (Aperto OTW, Cardionovum GmbH, Bonn, Germany) were used following pre-dilatation. Patients were followed for a minimum of 6months, with functional patency and complications as the primary outcomes.

Results

The technical success rate was 95%, with functional patency rates of 82%, 63%, and 42%, at 12, 24, and 36months, respectively. Freedom from restenosis was 71% in AVFs, 64% in AVGs, and 57% in central vein stenoses at 12months. The annual reintervention rate was 1.3 (IQR: 0.9–3.1). No major adverse events were reported, and vascular injuries occurred in 1.3% of cases. Univariate analysis revealed no significant impact of comorbidities on outcomes. Our clinical approach prioritizes DCB angioplasty as the first-line treatment, reserving stent grafts for select cases with recurrent or complex stenoses to preserve vascular anatomy and surgical options.

Conclusion

Drug-coated balloon angioplasty is a safe and effective treatment for vascular access stenoses, demonstrating robust functional patency and low restenosis rates. Our findings support the use of paclitaxel-eluting DCBs as a cornerstone in vascular access management, emphasizing their role in reducing complications and maintaining long-term access functionality.

### Bedside screening for fistula stenosis should be tailored to the site of the arteriovenous anastomosis [^115L6ofd]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Given different sites of stenosis and access blood flow rates (Qa), the criteria for diagnosing fistula stenosis might vary according to anastomotic site. To test this, we analyzed the database of a prospective blinded study seeking an optimal bedside screening program for fistula stenosis.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Several methods used during dialysis (physical examination [PE], dynamic and derived static venous pressure [VAPR], dialysis blood pump flow/arterial pressure ratio, and Qa measurement) to diagnose angiographically-proven > 50% stenosis were assessed in an unselected population of hemodialysis patients with mature fistulae (43 at the wrist [distal fistulae], 76 at mid-forearm or the elbow [proximal fistulae]).

Results

Prevalence of inflow stenosis was uninfluenced by anastomotic site, whereas outflow stenoses were more prevalent in proximal fistulae. The best test for inflow stenosis was Qa < 650 ml/min in distal fistulae and a combination of a positive PE and Qa < 900 ml/m in proximal fistulae. In proximal fistulae, PE and VAPR > 0.5 were both equally highly diagnostic of outflow stenosis. Tailoring choice of test to site of the anastomosis may also contain the screening-associated workload, by reducing the need to perform PE and measure VAPR, compared with a screening approach regardless of the access location.

Conclusions

Our study shows that an effective bedside screening program with ≥ 85% accuracy for fistula stenosis can be tailored to the site of the anastomosis, Qa being the tool of choice for the wrist, and PE alone or combined with Qa and VAPR measurements for more proximally-located accesses.

### Endovascular management of the "failing to mature" arteriovenous fistula [^115XxRji]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

The "failing to mature" arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is frequently encountered among patients in need of hemodialysis (HD). It is essential that its prompt recognition and management are conducted in a timely manner to allow its use in HD. The physical examination is essential in early identification of the "failing to mature" AVF and helps guide initial endovascular management. In most instances, endovascular evaluation successfully identifies all the lesions that have contributed to AVF derangement and retarded its proper maturation. It is common to find juxta-arterial stenosis as well as venous stenosis in the body of the AVF, or its venous outflow tract. However, a wide spectrum of lesions can be seen, and in many instances, multiple lesions coexist in the same deranged AVF. Identifying and understanding the impact of all the lesions is a prerequisite for any intervention. Balloon angioplasty is the mainstay of management of stenotic lesions. Accessory vein obliteration or ligation is necessary in some cases. Procedure-related complications are low and are reduced by caution and experience. Overall, endovascular management is successful in converting the "failing to mature" AVF to usable HD access in the majority of cases, but multiple interventions may be needed in some before the AVF can be used for HD. Once usable, these AVFs have good long-term assisted patency rates. When endovascular management is unsuccessful or not possible, surgical revision of the AVF, or creation of a new AV vascular access is necessary.

### Endovascular treatment to boost AV fistula maturation [^116niMKT]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2017). Low credibility.

Impaired fistula maturation is associated with puncture-related complications, insufficient dialysis and potential permanent access failure. Non-maturation is frequently initiated by stenotic vascular access vessels comprising the outflow veins, the arteriovenous anastomosis and infrequently the inflow artery. Further findings in maturation protraction are central venous stenoses or accessory outflow veins. Depending on the underlying pathology, several endovascular approaches to boost fistula maturation are possible. To date standard balloon angioplasty remains the primary proven treatment option.

### Clinical practice guidelines for vascular access [^111m61rU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Static pressure interpretation in hemodialysis vascular access — venous outlet stenosis detection and thresholds are outlined: venous outlet stenosis can be detected with venous PIA alone, and trend analysis is more useful than any single measurement. Detection of intra-access lesions requires simultaneous measurement of pressures from both the arterial and venous needles. Equivalence criteria must be met on each of 2 consecutive weeks to have a high likelihood of a 50% diameter lesion. Patients who develop a progressive and reproducible increase in venous or arterial segment greater than 0.25 units more than their previous baseline are likely to have a hemodynamically significant lesion. Intra-access strictures are characterized by a difference between the arterial and venous pressure ratios greater than 0.5 in grafts or greater than 0.3 in native fistulae, and sequential measurement of conductance at maximum prepump pressure permitted by the system can detect fistula dysfunction and stenosis.

### Quantification of the severity of outflow stenosis of hemodialysis fistulas with a pulse-and thrill-based scoring system [^113Ccphi]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

By integrating the pulsation and stenosis-related thrill characteristic changes, and considering the gravity-enhanced flow acceleration, we developed a PE-based outflow score (Fig. 1) that allowed us to categorize the severity of the outflow stenosis. Within this outflow score, PESOS represents the most severe outflow stenosis that can be detected by PE, whereas a score of 3 indicates good flow status of an AVF, which can usually be detected immediately after successful angioplasty. Thus, although the " PESOS" designation does not refer to "anatomical" stenosis, it is one of the categories included in the AVF outflow score. PESOS was defined as the "lack of thrill in a pulsatile segment of the access outflow when the access-bearing arm was being elevated".

Fig. 1
The AVF outflow score

Delegate score was defined as the worst score detected for access outflow. According to Bernoulli's law, the flow through the access outflow varies according to the access diameter (faster if the vascular lumen is small and vice-versa). In our daily practice, the assessor can usually detect different scores at locations along the access outflow. Among these scores, the worst was chosen as the delegate score and was recorded. Critical PESOS was defined as the situation when PESOS was detected upon palpation, along with a concomitant abnormal bruit upon auscultation. Abnormal bruits are referred to as "no bruit", or "discontinuous" or "systolic-only" bruits. A significant collateral vein was defined as a large collateral vein with a luminal diameter that was more than one-third the size of the adjacent AVF main trunk (Fig. 2).

### Endovascular tools for vascular access stenosis: flow-chart proposal [^115NXBWx]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2025). Medium credibility.

Stenosis represents the most relevant arteriovenous fistula (AVF) pathology and can affects the entire conduit forming the fistula, from afferent artery to central venous vessels. Correction of vascular access stenosis significantly affects the survival and quality of life for end stage renal disease patients (ESRD) dependent on hemodialysis. Guidelines consider the procedure of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) relevant for the primary treatment of these lesions with excellent results in restoring AVF immediately at the end of the procedure. From first AVF angioplasty in 1981 to now, wide scientific innovation has led to development of new devices, composed by different materials and technologies, specific for the site and the type of stenosis to be treated, able to manage resistant stenotic lesion and to reduce stenosis recurrences. International guidelines do not clearly specify all treatment possibilities in the individual case. In this review the authors want to provide specific information on most used devices for stenosis treatment based on literature evidence, showing when and where to use the various tools available with flow-chart treatment proposal.

### The role of Doppler ultrasonography in vascular access surveillance-controversies continue [^116xDpU8]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Only few other hemodialysis access topics are more passionately debated as ultrasound surveillance. The invention of arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) as vascular access for hemodialysis considerably decreased patients' morbidity and mortality. The patency of AVFs and AVGs is being threatened mostly by the development of a stenosis, which can lead to access dysfunction, inadequate dialysis, and/or access thrombosis. The latter represents an acute risk of access abandonment, and its therapy is more complicated and painful and costlier than the treatment of a (significant) stenosis. It seems, therefore, logical that treating significant stenoses before thrombosis occurs should be beneficial. However, it remains unclear when the risk of acute thrombosis due to stenosis is high enough to justify the preemptive intervention. Moreover, the definition of a hemodynamically significant stenosis varies between centers.

Stenosis is a vessel narrowing that could cause significant pressure drop and flow volume decrease, but also trigger mechanisms of thrombosis due to endothelial cell denudation and both platelet and von Willebrand factor activation in the case of very high shear stress (∼flow velocity). The presence of a stenosis can be detected by routine physical examination and/or by signs of dysfunction that manifest themselves during the dialysis session (monitoring). Such stenoses are clinically significant and include edema anatomically distal to the venous stenosis, prolonged bleeding, needling problems, fall of flow volume, decrease of dialysis dose due to higher recirculation, and so forth. However, the accuracy of clinical diagnosis of a stenosis depends on the stenosis location, on vascular access and patient's characteristics (depth, flow volume, vein branching, and compliance), and highly on the experience of the hemodialysis unit team, which is not always optimal. In a recent study by Castro et al.the clinical suspicion on AVF stenosis was not confirmed in 27% of cases. Some stenoses remain clinically asymptomatic, which explains at least part of the "sudden" thrombosis that develops without any warning signs. All these reasons led to the development of surveillance techniques.

### Hemodynamically significant arterial inflow stenosis in dysfunctional hemodialysis arteriovenous fistulae and grafts [^116zTg3E]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Hemodynamically significant arterial inflow stenosis in dysfunctional fistulae and grafts is poorly understood. No reliable clinical methods exist to detect arterial inflow stenosis. In this study, we assessed the accuracy of a novel screening method to detect arterial inflow stenosis in dysfunctional fistulae and grafts following successful juxta-anastomotic and venous outflow intervention.

Methods

We prospectively evaluated all patients (N = 204) referred to our academic center for angiographic evaluation of a dysfunctional dialysis fistula/graft from May 1, 2006 to June 30, 2007. Following successful angioplasty/stenting of the venous outflow and juxta-anastomotic areas, patients were screened for arterial inflow stenosis. The screening method involved detection of 1) weak thrill, or sluggish blood flow on the post-intervention angiogram, 2) low mean arterial blood pressures in the dialysis access arm compared to the contralateral arm, and 3) inadequate blood flow at the first hemodialysis session post-intervention. If patients screened positive for any of these, they were further evaluated for arterial inflow stenosis.

Results

Fifteen patients (15/204) were positive for arterial inflow stenosis on screening study. Eleven of those 15 had arterial stenosis on angiography, giving our screening method a positive predictive value of 73.3%. Eight patients were successfully treated by angioplasty/stenting. Two patients successfully underwent surgical intervention. Two year patency of revascularization was 91% (10/11).

Conclusions

Hemodynamically significant arterial inflow stenosis occurs and can be detected by simple clinical methods. Interventions for correction of the arterial inflow stenosis are successful.

PPL and API are potentially useful tools in defining the severity of pure inflow stenosis for mature AVFs in the hands of trained examiners with high sensitivity and specificity. We consider that treatment of both symptomatic and asymptomatic critical inflow stenoses is justifiable because the magnitude of their post-stenotic pressure energy drops is similar.

### Clinical practice guidelines for vascular access [^111hAPXA]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for vascular access — Table 5 access physical examination outlines normal and abnormal findings when clinicians look, listen, and feel the access. On inspection of a fistula, normal features include a well developed main venous outflow with areas of straight vein usable for cannulation and the vessel partially collapses when the arm is elevated above head, while a normal arteriovenous graft (AVG) is a uniform sized graft in loop or straight configuration without irregular areas or aneurysm formations. Abnormal visual findings suggesting poor maturation include a fistula with poor maturation — multiple venous outflow veins (accessory veins), poorly defined cannulation areas, and infection signs such as redness, swelling, broken skin, drainage, induration; steal syndrome may show the hand of the access limb discolored due to lack of arterial blood flow with nail bed and skin color changes. On auscultation, a normal bruit is low pitch continuous diastolic and systolic, whereas stenosis presents as high pitch discontinuous systolic only. On palpation, a normal fistula has a thrill at the arterial anastomosis and throughout the entire outflow vein that is easy to compress and a normal AVG has a thrill strongest at the arterial anastomosis but felt over the entire graft and easy to compress; stenosis in a fistula can present as a pulse at the site of a stenotic lesion with a water-hammer feel, infection may be warm to touch with swelling, and for suspected steal syndrome clinicians should feel bilateral limbs and compare temperature, grip strength, range of motion, and any complaint of pain.

Hemodialysis access stenosis — KDOQI Guidelines: The KDOQI Guidelines recommend that stenoses in prosthetic or autogenous accesses should be treated prophylactically with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or surgical revision if the stenosis is > 50% of the lumen diameter and is associated with clinical/physiologic abnormalities. Once access occlusion occurs, prolonged patency is unusual, and the venous anastomotic lesion of an AV graft is a proliferative vascular lesion that is difficult to dilate and has a very high recurrence rate; moreover, the injury caused by angioplasty of the stenotic lesion can itself promote accelerated neointimal hyperplasia.

Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation assessment — clinical examination and ultrasound criteria: An experienced and knowledgeable member of the vascular access team can accurately assess maturity in most AVFs at 4 weeks after creation, and experienced dialysis nurses were able to predict with 80% accuracy the ability to use AVFs for dialysis. Minimum ultrasound criteria have been established to include AVF internal diameter, 4–5 mm; depth of AVF from skin, ≤ 6 mm; and blood flow (brachial artery and AVF blood flow, 400–500 mL/min). Should a correctable cause for AVF immaturity be found (eg, culprit stenosis or collateral vessels), this should be corrected in a timely manner to facilitate AV access maturation.

### Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty… [^113mZdmA]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- A prosthetic arteriovenous fistula is often necessary in patients with chronic renal failure who lack suitable venous anatomy for the construction of an autogenous AV access. Not infrequently, these conduits fail as a result of neointimal hyperplasia obstructing the outflow tract at the venous anastomosis. Six patients underwent one or more attempts at balloon dilation of an anastomotic stenosis. Grafts had either thrombosed, exhibited poor arterial inflow, or developed high venous pressures. Eight of ten dilations were outright failures, while two dilations each provided an additional three months of graft function before surgical revision became necessary. We conclude that percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is of very limited value as a salvage procedure in the failing synthetic vascular access, and should be attempted only as a possible temporizing measure in those individuals in whom definitive surgical correction must be delayed.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^114hJxJv]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI 2019 vascular access — physical examination accuracy for arteriovenous fistula (AVF) dysfunction compares clinical exam with angiography and reports moderate agreement for general nephrologists (kappa = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.40–0.57) and near‑perfect agreement for a trained nephrology resident (kappa = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77–0.95); in Asif et al (n = 147), exam by an interventional nephrologist showed poor accuracy for central vein and AVF body stenosis, moderate for inflow and coexisting inflow/outflow stenosis, and good for outflow stenosis, with stenosis by angiography defined as 50% luminal narrowing compared with the adjacent normal segment.

### Clinical practice guidelines for vascular access [^117Ui1iJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) venous stenosis — management outcomes and surveillance: Treatment of hemodynamically significant venous stenosis prolongs the use-life of the AVF, and a study of 32 patients and 30 controls showed a beneficial effect on AVF survival of prophylactic angioplasty of stenoses. In a larger cohort over 5 years, preemptive treatment decreased the failure rate (P = 0.003), and treatment (P = 0.009) and greater baseline access flow (P = 0.001) were the only variables associated with favorable outcome. In a population of 120 patients with AVFs, UDT measurements were reproducible and highly accurate in detecting stenosis and predicting thrombosis in forearm AVFs. In AVFs, 75% of stenoses producing low flow are at or near the AV anastomosis and 25% are in the outflow track.

### Clinical practice guidelines for vascular access [^1177DzLm]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Vascular access — angioplasty for AVF stenosis notes that dilation often is painful and may need local anesthesia; outflow venous stenosis may be "rock hard" and require high-pressure balloons (bursting pressures of 25 to 30 atmospheres) with more prolonged inflation, while resistant stenoses are less common, usually less than 1% in forearm and 5% of upper-arm fistulae. The degree of residual effacement tolerated varies, with some demanding no residual unless it is the first PTA ever done; there is no convincing proof that such lesions respond better to cutting balloons because studies have been small and not prospective, and the Work Group recommends that high-pressure balloons be used first because cutting devices have not been tested adequately.

### The role of Doppler ultrasonography in vascular access surveillance-controversies continue [^113G4A4J]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic hemodialysis therapy required regular entry into the patient's blood stream with adequate flow. The use of arteriovenous fistulas and grafts is linked with lower morbidity and mortality than the use of catheters. However, these types of accesses are frequently affected by stenoses, which decrease the flow and lead to both inadequate dialysis and access thrombosis. The idea of duplex Doppler ultrasound surveillance is based on the presumption that in-time diagnosis of an asymptomatic significant stenosis and its treatment prolongs access patency. Details of performed trials are conflicting, and current guidelines do not support ultrasound surveillance. This review article summarizes the trials performed and focuses on the reasons of conflicting results. We stress the need of precise standardized criteria of significant access stenosis and the weakness of the metaanalyses performed.

### Should all inflow stenoses be treated in failing autogenous hemodialysis fistulae? [^113q7K3r]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether angioplasty of inflow stenosis in malfunctioning but patent autogenous hemodialysis fistulae has an impact on postintervention primary patency in patients without a clinical indicator of inflow-related access malfunction.

Materials and Methods

Medical records for 76 procedures in 62 patients with inflow stenoses undergoing fistulography in nonthrombosed mature autogenous fistulae without an inflow-related indication of access malfunction over a 5-year period were reviewed retrospectively. Control and treatment arms were defined as patients with untreated (26 procedures in 23 patients) and treated (50 procedures in 39 patients) inflow stenoses, respectively. All patients in both arms of the study had concurrent intrafistula and/or venous outflow stenosis, which were treated successfully with angioplasty. The clinical endpoint was defined as return for a failing or thrombosed access (ie, primary patency). A two-tailed unpaired Student t test was performed to compare primary patency and percent inflow stenosis in treatment (angioplasty) and control (untreated inflow stenoses) groups, with significance defined at P < .05. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed.

Results

There was no significant difference in percent inflow stenosis between control and treatment arms (P = 0.95). There was no significant difference in access patency between the two groups (139 and 124 d for control and treated groups, respectively; P = 0.95). No procedural complications occurred in either arm of the study.

Conclusions

Angioplasty of inflow stenosis in failing autogenous fistulae without an appropriate clinical indicator of an inflow pathologic process does not improve postintervention primary patency.

### Interventions for thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts [^116SD7Gc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients who present with problems with definitive dialysis access (arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG)) become catheter dependent (temporary access), a condition that often carries a higher risk of infections, central venous occlusions and recurrent hospitalisations. For AVG, primary patency rates are reported to be 30% to 90% in patients undergoing thrombectomy or thrombolysis. According to the National Kidney Foundation-Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) guidelines, surgery is preferred when the cause of the thrombosis is a stenosis at the site of the anastomosis in thrombosed AVF. The European Best Practice Guidelines (EBPG) reported that thrombosed AVF may be preferably treated with endovascular techniques, but when the cause of thrombosis is in the anastomosis, surgery provides better results with re-anastomosis. Therefore, there is a need to carry out a systematic review to determine the effectiveness and safety of the intervention for thrombosed fistulae.

Objectives

This review aims to establish the efficacy and safety of interventions for failed AVF and AVG in patients receiving haemodialysis (HD).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 28 January 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Portal (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

The review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in people undergoing HD treatment using AVF or AVG presenting with clinical or haemodynamic evidence of thrombosis. Patients had to have used an AVF or AVG at least once.

Data Collection and Analysis

Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

Our search strategy identified 14 eligible studies (1176 randomised participants) for inclusion in this review. We included three types of interventions for the treatment of thrombosed AVF and AVG: (1) types of thrombectomy, (2) types of thrombolysis and (3) surgical procedures. Most of the included studies had a high risk of bias due to a poor study design, a low number of patients and industry involvement. Overall, there was insufficient evidence to suggest that a specific intervention was better than another for the outcomes of failure, primary patency at 30 days, technical success and adverse events (both major and minor). Primary patency at 30 days may improve with surgical compared to mechanical thrombectomy (3 studies, 404 participants: RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.67); however, the evidence is very uncertain. Death, access dysfunction, successful dialysis, and SONG (Standards Outcomes in Nephrology) outcomes were rarely reported. The current review is limited by the small number of available studies with a limited number of patients enrolled. Most of the studies included in this review have a high risk of bias and a low or very low certainty of evidence. Further research is required to define the most effective and clinically appropriate technique for access dysfunction.

Authors' Conclusions

It remains unclear whether any intervention therapy affects the patency at 30 days or failure in any thrombosed HD AV access (very low certainty of evidence). Future research will very likely change the evidence base. Based on the importance of HD access to these patients, future studies of these interventions among people receiving HD should be a priority.

### Cephalic arch stenosis [^113DD9WN]. Seminars in Dialysis (2007). Low credibility.

The Kidney Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines and the Fistula First Initiative for vascular access have had a measurable impact on the incidence and prevalence of the type of access used to deliver hemodialysis in the United States. There has been a yearly increase in the placement of arteriovenous fistulas and an exponential increase in endovascular treatment of failing and immature fistulas. Undoubtedly, the predominant cause of fistula malfunction is stenosis within the access system. The stenotic lesions can occur anywhere within the access system from the arteries to the outflow and central veins. One of the relatively common sites for stenosis in patients with brachiocephalic fistulas is the cephalic arch region. While access stenoses at many other sites have been successfully treated with percutaneous balloon angioplasty, the results of this approach in the management of cephalic arch stenosis (CAS) have been rather disappointing. This has been in part due to multiple factors including the resistant nature of the stenosis, the development of early restenosis, as well as poor patency and high vein rupture rates. This article discusses the anatomy, postulated etiology and percutaneous interventions for the treatment of CAS. In addition, the report highlights surgical alternatives to the management of stenosis in this segment of the cephalic vein.

### Evaluating and treating venous outflow stenoses is necessary for the successful open surgical treatment of arteriovenous fistula aneurysms [^111FUHWQ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) aneurysms (AVFAs) can lead to skin erosion, bleeding, difficult access while on hemodialysis, and poor cosmetic appearance. We reviewed our experience in treating patients with aneurysmal dilatation of their AVF.

Methods

We reviewed clinical data of 48 patients (37 men; overall mean age, 55 years; range, 28–85 years) with an AVFA who underwent treatment during a 30-month period. Relevant clinical variables and treatment outcomes were analyzed.

Results

All patients underwent a fistulogram, and 90% required percutaneous angioplasty to improve outflow. Fifty-six percent of patients had one stenotic outflow lesion, and 44% had at least two tandem outflow stenoses that required treatment. Open repair with aneurysmorrhaphy was performed in one stage in 64% of patients and in two stages in 36%. A tunneled hemodialysis catheter was required in 11 patients (23%) until the surgically repaired AVF was ready for use again, comprising 10 patients treated with single-stage surgery and only one patient in the staged group. All AVFAs were effectively treated, and patients were able to maintain functional use of their access when healed.

Conclusions

There is a high association of venous outflow stenoses and AVFA. Comprehensive therapy should encompass treatment of any venous outflow stenoses before open AVFA repair. A two-stage repair may decrease tunneled hemodialysis catheter use in patients with multiple aneurysms.

### Quantification of the severity of outflow stenosis of hemodialysis fistulas with a pulse-and thrill-based scoring system [^114Y4vDa]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyper-pulsatility of hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the basic physical examination finding when there is outflow stenosis. The arm elevation test can also be utilized to detect outflow stenosis. If there is no significant outflow stenosis, the AVF should collapse, at least partially, because of the effect of gravity when the AVF-bearing arm is elevated to a level above that of the heart. However, if there is significant outflow stenosis, the portion of the AVF downstream of the stenosis will collapse, while the portion upstream of the stenosis will remain distended (Clin J Am Soc Nephro 8:1220–7, 2013). In our daily practice, when performing the arm elevation test, we not only observe the collapsibility of the access outflow but also palpate the outflow to identify a background thrill that sometimes disappears with the arm at rest, only to reappear when the arm is elevated. If there is no thrill upon arm elevation, we assume that the outflow stenosis is severe and refer to this condition as "physical examination significant outflow stenosis" (PESOS). The aim of this study is to characterize PESOS using percentage stenosis and Doppler flow parameters.

Methods

We performed a case-control study using data collected prospectively between June 2019 and December 2019. A pulse- and thrill-based score system was developed to assess the severity of AVF outflow stenosis. We recorded the outflow scores and Doppler measurements performed in 84 patients with mature fistulas over a 6-month period. Angiograms were reviewed to determine the severity of outflow stenosis, which was assessed by calculation of percentage stenosis.

Results

Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that a cutoff value of ≥ 74.44% stenosis discriminated PESOS from other AVF outflow scores, with an area under the curve of 0.9011. PESOS diagnosed cases with ≥ 75% outflow stenosis in an AVF, with a sensitivity of 80.39%, a specificity of 78.79%, a positive predictive value of 85.42%, and a negative predictive value of 72.22%.

Conclusions

PESOS can be used to diagnose ≥ 75% outflow stenosis in an AVF, with or without a significant collateral vein, and its diagnostic accuracy is high. The use of PESOS as an indicator for treatment implies that physical examination may represent a useful surveillance tool.

Guideline 15 — high-pressure balloon angioplasty for clinically significant arteriovenous (AV) access stenosis states that, aside from special circumstances, standard high-pressure balloon angioplasty remains the treatment of choice for the majority of anatomic and clinically significant AV access stenotic lesions; a clinically significant AV access stenotic lesion is one that is accompanied by clinical signs and symptoms and shows > 50% narrowing relative to adjacent normal vein diameter by angiography or ultrasound. Re-stenoses at the initial lesion or elsewhere in the previously treated dialysis circuit occurs up to 60% of the time at 6 months.

### Safety and efficacy of a new covered stent in hemodialysis vascular access outflow stenosis: a Brazilian multicenter retrospective study [^112C3D9i]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the United States, nearly 500,000 patients with end-stage renal disease receive maintenance dialysis treatments. Brazil, the largest Latin American country, ranks third in the list of nations with the largest number of dialysis patients. About 148,000 patients were on dialysis in Brazil in 2021, with 94% of them undergoing hemodialysis as their renal replacement therapy.

Three types of hemodialysis vascular access are currently used: autologous arteriovenous fistulas (AVF), arteriovenous grafts (AVG), and central venous catheters. AVFs remain the first choice for chronic hemodialysis due to their longer patency, lower complication rates, and reduced overall cost compared to AVGs and hemodialysis catheters. – Despite their favorable outcomes, between 23% and 50% of AVFs show maturation problems, – resulting in difficulties in achieving the appropriate vein caliber and flow for hemodialysis. In addition, both patients with AVFs and AVGs can develop stenosis and thrombosis associated with neointimal hyperplasia. Venous stenosis is the primary cause of vascular access failure, and it occurs in the peri-anastomotic region and outflow segment of AVFs or at the graft-vein anastomosis of polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) grafts.

For years, first-line treatment of AVFs stenoses has been percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, generally with high-pressure or cutting balloons. However, restenosis and reintervention rates associated with this technique remain incredibly high; only 26%–53% of AVFs still function without subsequent interventions 12 months after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.

The use of stent grafts (i.e. covered stents or endoprostheses) has gained significant interest as a primary treatment for failing AVFs. Studies have shown that stent grafts achieve more favorable patency rates than other treatments. The application of a stent graft provides protection against vein rupture and creates a physical barrier that may prevent the development of neointimal hyperplasia. Furthermore, stent grafts with improved flexibility can better adapt to the challenging anatomy of segments like the cephalic arch, thereby reducing the risks of stent migration, stent collapse, and in-stent stenosis.

Hemodynamically significant venous stenosis — The commonly used parameter to characterize hemodynamic relevance is a reduction in vessel diameter exceeding 50% based on angiographic and/or ultrasonographic findings. Because it may be difficult to describe reliably the percentage of narrowing in a native vein due to prestenotic and/or poststenotic aneurysmic enlargement, the hemodynamic relevance of a 50% stenosis in a native AVF therefore should be supported by clinical symptoms, abnormal physical findings, and flow measurements.

Guideline 5 rationale — initial problems describes that physiological swelling disappears within the first week; that persistent swelling requires further attention to exclude major outflow obstruction and noninvasive ultrasound examination helps confirm extravasations and hematomas or purulent infiltrations, as well as strictures/stenoses of the venous outflow tract; that DDU is the preferred diagnostic method because it avoids diagnostic cannulation of the newly created AVF; that if a stenosis is found, it should be treated with a balloon angioplasty; and that persistent hand edema usually follows a side-to-side anastomosis and the lesion should be treated early by ligation of the tributaries.

### Dialysis access maintenance: plain balloon angioplasty [^1156YVRG]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Subcutaneous arteriovenous fistulae were developed by Brescio and Cimino in 1966, providing vascular access for haemodialysis. This was followed by the introduction of expanded polytetrafluorethylene (ePTFE) grafts into clinical practice in 1976. These are the most established means of long-term haemodialysis. However, preserving the patency of these accesses remains challenging. Stenosis can develop in the access circuit due to multiple factors and if untreated, can lead to reduced effectiveness of dialysis, progressive loss of function and thrombosis of the access circuit. These outcomes all lead to significant morbidity and result in substantial economic cost.

Plain balloon angioplasty (PBA), typically with high-pressure balloons, is considered to be the mainstay of treatment for dialysis access circuit stenoses and is indicated when there is an angiographically significant stenosis associated with clinical dysfunction. Clinical manifestation of access dysfunction manifest broadly as disorders of inflow (needling difficulty, inability to achieve adequate dialysis flow speed, and poor fistula maturation) or outflow (arm swelling and prolonged bleeding). Although the outcomes of surgical revision have been shown to be comparable to angioplasty, the use of angioplasty can prolong the life of a fistula whilst preserving the option of surgical revision. Angioplasty also has the added advantage of allowing treatment of synchronous lesions. In keeping with the latest KDOQI guidelines, the use of PBA must be factored in as part of the overall, individual patient's pathway and long-term care of each patient (the ESKD (End Stage Kidney Disease) Life Plan). The aim of this article is to summarise the evidence for the use of PBA in maintaining functional access circuits.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^112YdKir]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Routine physical examination monitoring for arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and arteriovenous graft (AVG) outlines normal findings and abnormalities suggestive of flow-related dysfunction. Normal appearance includes a well-developed main venous outflow with no irregular/dilated areas or aneurysm formations for AVF, and a uniform-sized graft in a loop or straight configuration with no irregular areas or aneurysm or seroma formations for AVG. Abnormal visual signs include AVF with poor maturation with multiple venous outflow veins draining or poorly defined cannulation areas; stenosis indicators include narrowing of the outflow vein, abnormal pulsations, or aneurysm formations; and dilated neck veins or surface collateral veins above the vascular access. On auscultation, normal is low-pitch continuous diastolic and systolic, whereas dysfunction presents as high-pitch discontinuous systolic only; steal syndrome in AVF may have a very strong bruit. On palpation, normal includes a thrill at the arterial anastomosis and throughout the entire outflow vein that is easy to compress for AVF and a thrill strongest at the arterial anastomosis but felt over the entire graft for AVG; with stenosis, a pulse at the lesion may be water-hammer in quality and feel, and in AVG a low intra-access blood flow feels mushy.

### Intimal hyperplasia, stenosis, and arteriovenous fistula maturation failure in the hemodialysis fistula maturation study [^116qKZD2]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Intimal hyperplasia and stenosis are often cited as causes of arteriovenous fistula maturation failure, but definitive evidence is lacking. We examined the associations among preexisting venous intimal hyperplasia, fistula venous stenosis after creation, and clinical maturation failure. The Hemodialysis Fistula Maturation Study prospectively observed 602 men and women through arteriovenous fistula creation surgery and their postoperative course. A segment of the vein used to create the fistula was collected intraoperatively for histomorphometric examination. On ultrasounds performed 1 day and 2 and 6 weeks after fistula creation, we assessed fistula venous stenosis using pre-specified criteria on the basis of ratios of luminal diameters and peak blood flow velocities at certain locations along the vessel. We determined fistula clinical maturation using criteria for usability during dialysis. Preexisting venous intimal hyperplasia, expressed per 10% increase in a hyperplasia index (range of 0%-100%), modestly associated with lower fistula blood flow rate (relative change, -2.5%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], -4.6% to -0.4%; P = 0.02) at 6 weeks but did not significantly associate with stenosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.16; P = 0.07) at 6 weeks or failure to mature clinically without procedural assistance (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.15; P = 0.07). Fistula venous stenosis at 6 weeks associated with maturation failure (OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.25 to 3.12; P = 0.004) after controlling for case mix factors, dialysis status, and fistula location. These findings suggest that postoperative fistula venous stenosis associates with fistula maturation failure. Preoperative venous hyperplasia may associate with maturation failure but if so, only modestly.

### Quantification of the severity of outflow stenosis of hemodialysis fistulas with a pulse-and thrill-based scoring system [^117W745z]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypothesis 2

PESOS patients had a significantly higher percentage stenosis than all the other patients with outflow stenosis. Auscultation enabled the detection of a subgroup of PESOS patients — the critical PESOS group — who had a significantly higher percentage stenosis than those comprising the non-critical PESOS group. Percentage stenosis of asymptomatic PESOS patients did not statistically differ from that of symptomatic PESOS patients. Finally, percentage stenosis was higher for AVFs with a significant collateral vein than for AVFs with a small or no collateral vein (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5
Subgroup comparisons of percent stenosis for PESOS

Hypothesis 3

Using the ROC analysis, if percentage stenosis was used as a classifier to discriminate PESOS from other outflow scores for AVFs with a small or no collateral vein, a cut-off value of 74.44% was identified using Youden's index (Fig. 6 a). When the presence of PESOS was used as a PE indicator to detect ≥ 75% outflow stenosis in AVFs with and without a collateral vein, the diagnostic accuracy was as follows: sensitivity 80.39%, specificity 78.79%, positive predictive value 85.42%, and negative predictive value 72.22% (p < 0.0001).

Fig. 6

A cut-off value of 81.85% stenosis was selected to differentiate critical PESOS from non-critical PESOS for AVFs with a small or no collateral vein (Fig. 6 b). When critical PESOS was used as an indicator to diagnose ≥ 82% outflow stenosis in all the AVFs studied, the diagnostic accuracy was as follows: sensitivity 81.25%, specificity 81.82%, positive predictive value 56.52%, and negative predictive value 93.75%. The PS, ED, TAMEAN, and Qa in patients with critical PESOS were all significantly lower than in patients with non-critical PESOS (Fig. 7).

KDOQI 2019 vascular access — Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and arteriovenous graft (AVG) stenosis burden and the role of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) — notes high dysfunction rates and continued use of angioplasty. A multicenter randomized controlled trial found that up to 60% of AVFs failed to mature, and AVGs have graft–vein junction stenosis leading to thrombosis in 80% of AVGs. Regarding therapy, the guideline states that PTA is the first-line treatment for stenosis in the access circuit and that this generally remains the case, while acknowledging evolving trials and devices that may alter indications and device selection.

### The role of surveillance in mature arteriovenous fistula management [^116fNMzj]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2006). Low credibility.

The existing guidelines recommend arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) surveillance by access blood flow (Qa) measurement and the correction of hemodynamically significant stenoses to prolong access survival. Unfortunately, many studies supporting these recommendations are inadequate methodologically; therefore, both the optimal criteria for surveillance and the value of preventive stenosis repair in AVF remain controversial. Recent literature confirms that Qa measurement allows an accurate identification of both stenosis (area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.80–0.93) and access at risk of failure (AUC ranging from 0.82–0.98) in AVFs and suggests a Qa < 700–1000 ml/min and/or a reduction in Qa > 25% as optimal predictors for stenosis and a Qa < 400 ml/min for incipient thrombosis. Recent prospective studies evaluated whether Qa surveillance could improve AVF patency rates compared to monitoring based on clinical and dialysis-related criteria alone. The majority of studies have historical, rather than concurrent, control groups and provide conflicting results, some showing a reduction and some showing no change in thrombosis rates by Qa monitoring. On the other hand, the few randomized controlled studies available show that Qa surveillance, when coupled with preemptive intervention, reduces the already low thrombosis rate in AVF and suggest that the functional access life can be prolonged. However, there is still the need for additional methodologically adequate studies to understand fully the role of surveillance in AVF management.

### Medial claviculectomy for the treatment of recalcitrant central venous stenosis of hemodialysis patients [^114WGFEN]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Outflow tract stenosis is the leading cause of hemodialysis access loss. Many lesions are highly resistant to endovascular treatment, necessitating open surgical intervention. We present our experience using medial claviculectomy for treatment of recalcitrant lesions at the thoracic outlet.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent medial claviculectomy for dialysis-associated venous thoracic outlet syndrome at our institution between February 2013 and February 2018. Data collection included demographics, past medical history, access history, subsequent procedures, preoperative and postoperative brachial volume flows, and access use.

Results

We performed 25 medial claviculectomies in 25 patients with central venous stenosis. Four patients underwent concomitant central venous bypass and were excluded from this study. Twelve accesses were created at our institution; of these, the average access age was 41.6 months (± 26.7 months). All patients previously underwent multiple angioplasty attempts to treat outflow stenosis and continued to have residual symptoms and poor fistula function. Medial claviculectomy with venolysis and angioplasty were performed to treat residual outflow stenosis at the level of the subclavian vein. Twenty-one patients had residual stenosis requiring angioplasty. Six patients had subclavian rupture requiring stent graft placement. All patients reported symptom improvement and immediate use of the fistula after medial claviculectomy. Nineteen (76%) patients reported complete resolution of symptoms after the procedure. Ultimately, eight (32%) ipsilateral arteriovenous accesses were lost, and six (24%) patients died in follow-up with patent, functional fistulas. Median length of follow-up was 17 months (interquartile range, 5–28 months). The 18-month primary patency and secondary patency with regard to subclavian vein interventions were 28% (95% confidence interval, 13.8%-56.1%) and 84% (95% confidence interval, 69.7%-100%), respectively. One patient required ligation for high-output cardiac failure. One patient had contralateral brachiocephalic jailing, which was corrected with kissing brachiocephalic stents.

Conclusions

Medial claviculectomy is an effective treatment of recalcitrant central venous stenosis of the thoracic outlet. Balloon angioplasty or stent or stent graft placement is often necessary after extrinsic compression is alleviated and demonstrates acceptable secondary patency rates.

### Association of risk stratification score with dialysis vascular access stenosis [^117Di3RA]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we observed that patients receiving dialysis through arteriovenous access with high-risk VA score were more likely to have significant stenosis than patients with a low-risk VA score. These findings suggest that a higher VA score may be useful for predicting which patients may have clinically significant stenosis as seen in imaging studies. We also observed that positive clinical monitoring results alone were insufficient for identifying stenosis. Thus, we recommend that an automated data-driven risk stratifying scoring system may have clinical utility for preventing and/or expediently treating access stenosis in patients who receive dialysis.

A brief discussion on clinical monitoring strategy with its inherent limitations is warranted. A clinical monitoring strategy includes physical examination supplemented with routine laboratory studies, dialysis adequacy, miscannulation, hemostasis post-needle withdrawal, and other clinical signs suggestive of dysfunctional dialysis access. Published studies that examined how these clinical indicators correlate with stenosis identified by angiographic imaging. – The KDOQI 2019 guideline 15.1 recommends referral for confirmatory evaluation including imaging studies based on select clinical indicators, while attempting to provide a new roadmap for access surveillance. The new "Access flow dysfunction" terminology distinguishes between stenosis-mediated access flow dysfunction and other causes, such as aneurysms. Guideline 13 recommends regular clinical monitoring by a "knowledgeable and experienced health practitioner" to detect clinical indicators of flow dysfunction of the AVF. However, the guidelines fail to define "knowledgeable and experienced health practitioners" and how to standardize clinical monitoring across people of various skill sets. Regardless, a robust clinical monitoring strategy needs a dedicated trained team available throughout the week for assessing patients' dialysis accesses, but implementation of such a strategy is a logistical challenge. Additionally, the challenge of performing regular, thorough monitoring of patients' dialysis accesses has exponentially worsened during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, with a high workforce attrition rate and difficulty with training new staff.

### Quantification of the severity of outflow stenosis of hemodialysis fistulas with a pulse-and thrill-based scoring system [^1127MBBk]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypothesis 1

AVFs with PESOS (case group) is associated with more severe stenosis-related hemodynamic derangement than AVFs with other outflow scores (control group). The magnitude of the stenosis-related hemodynamic derangement could be assessed by Doppler flow measurement. According to Ohm's law, the higher is the percentage outflow stenosis, the slower is the intra-access flow rate. The flow parameters [peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), time-averaged mean velocity (TAMEAN), volumetric blood flow rate (Qa), pulsatility index (PI), and resistance index (RI)] of the case group are presumed to be inferior to those of the control group.

Hypothesis 2

AVFs with PESOS (case group) have a higher percentage stenosis than AVFs with all other outflow scores (control group). The anatomical severity of the stenosis was assessed by calculating percentage stenosis, which was measured on archived images on a monitor with a measurement tool built into the image viewer. Percentage stenosis was determined by comparing the minimum intraluminal area with the average areas of the distal and proximal "normal" vein. When aneurysmal dilatation was adjacent to the stenotic lesion, the normal vein lying immediately beyond the aneurysm was used as the reference. With cephalic arch lesions, only the normal vein lying immediately distal (upstream) was used as the reference section of the vessel. If more than one stenosis was present along the access outflow, the most severe stenosis was selected for calculation of percentage stenosis (Fig. 2).

Hypothesis 3

PESOS can be used as a PE indicator of outflow stenosis, which is defined as far more than 50% narrowing of the lumen. The outflow score is a categorical estimate of stenosis-related hemodynamic derangement. To avoid over-estimation of the anatomical percentage stenosis, only AVFs with small or no collateral veins were selected for analysis (Fig. 2).

Statistical analysis

Comparisons of Doppler flow parameters (PSV, EDV, TAMEAN, PI, and RI) and percentage stenosis between the case and control groups were performed using unpaired t -tests. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and the aforementioned analyses were performed using Prism Version 6.0 for Mac software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Fisher's exact test was used to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the use of PESOS.

### Dialysis arteriovenous access monitoring and surveillance according to the 2017 Spanish guidelines [^113jA7bj]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2018). Low credibility.

The Spanish Multidisciplinary Group on Vascular Access (GEMAV), which includes experts from the five scientific societies involved (nephrology (S.E.N.), vascular surgery (SEACV), interventional radiology (SERAM-SERVEI), infectious diseases (SEIMC), and nephrology nursing (SEDEN)), along with the methodological support of the Iberoamerican Cochrane Centre, has developed the Spanish Clinical Guidelines on Vascular Access for Hemodialysis. This article summarizes the main issues from the guideline's chapter entitled "Monitoring and surveillance of arteriovenous access". We will analyze the current evidence on conflicting topics such as the value of the flow-based screening methods for the arteriovenous access surveillance or the role of Doppler ultrasound as the imaging exploration to confirm suspected stenosis. In addition, the concept of significant stenosis and the criteria to perform the elective intervention for stenosis were reviewed. The adoption of these guidelines will hopefully translate into a reduced risk of thrombosis and increased patency rates for both arteriovenous fistulas and grafts.

### Inflow stenosis obscures recognition of outflow stenosis by dialysis venous pressure: analysis by a mathematical model [^113d9CHG]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies have shown that inflow stenosis of haemodialysis grafts is more common than previously realized. The influence of inflow stenosis on graft haemodynamics and venous pressure (VP) surveillance has not been previously systematically studied.

Methods

We used a well-established mathematical model to determine the relation between inflow stenosis and static VP (adjusted for mean arterial pressure, VP/MAP), outflow stenosis and artery and vein luminal diameters. We applied low, median and high ratios of artery/vein diameters from 94 patients with grafts. The median ratio was 0.77, indicating that the artery was generally narrower than the vein.

Results

The model shows that inflow stenosis reduces VP/MAP. More importantly, however, as outflow stenosis progresses, fixed inflow stenosis causes a delayed increase in VP/MAP followed by a rapid increase at critical outflow stenosis. When both stenoses progress together, their relative rates determine whether and how rapidly VP/MAP increases. The increase in VP/MAP is remarkably abrupt when the rate of inflow stenosis approaches that of outflow stenosis. No increase occurs when inflow stenosis progresses as fast or faster than outflow stenosis.

Conclusion

Inflow stenosis exerts its most important haemodynamic effect through its interaction with outflow stenosis. As outflow stenosis progresses, inflow stenosis causes a delayed and then rapid increase in VP/MAP at critical outflow stenosis. This increase may not be detected before thrombosis unless measurements are very frequent. Inflow stenosis has an important impact on graft haemodynamics and surveillance because of its location in the relatively narrow inflow tract.

Hemodialysis access stenosis evaluation and treatment — When a test indicates the likely presence of a stenosis, angiography should be used to definitively establish the presence and degree of stenosis, and the Work Group is in agreement with the Society for Interventional Radiology, which recommends angioplasty if the stenosis is greater than 50% by diameter. There have been no large-scale trials to determine whether correction of only hemodynamically significant lesions is superior to correction of all stenosis greater than 50%, and at the time of intervention, hemodynamic evaluation of each stenosis generally is not carried out. Until such studies are conducted, the Work Group believes that the value of routine use of any technique for detecting anatomic stenosis alone — without concomitant measurement of access flow, venous pressure, recirculation, or other physiological parameters — has not been established. Stenotic lesions should not be repaired merely because they are present, and if such correction is performed, then intraprocedural studies of QA, or PA, before and after PTA should be conducted to show a functional improvement with a "successful" PTA.
