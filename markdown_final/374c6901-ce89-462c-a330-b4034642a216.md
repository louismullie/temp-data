## Question

How should care be managed following a cardiac arrest?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how care should be managed following a cardiac arrest. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching pathophysiology of post–cardiac arrest syndrome and how it frames priorities. Then, I should address immediate stabilization and monitoring. Next, I will consider hemodynamic optimization, temperature management, coronary evaluation, and neurological care including sedation, seizures, and neuromuscular blockade. After that, I will examine respiratory strategy, other supportive measures, phenotyping and heterogeneity, systems and quality metrics, special populations, and finally survivorship and recovery, anchoring each section to current guidelines and key trials while verifying points as I go and correcting any missteps I catch along the way.

> Let me first confirm the conceptual framework: successful resuscitation triggers a post–cardiac arrest syndrome with four interacting components — brain injury, myocardial dysfunction, systemic ischemia–reperfusion, and the persistent precipitating cause — and this evolves over days to weeks; acknowledging these domains keeps me from prematurely narrowing focus to a single organ system when multisystem support is essential [^112576vY] [^117WRogc].

> Next, I should review immediate stabilization after ROSC because the first 24–72 hours are a therapeutic window; that means securing airway with controlled ventilation avoiding hypoxia and hyperoxia, establishing invasive blood pressure monitoring, initiating continuous core temperature monitoring promptly, instituting serial neurological assessments, and obtaining serial labs including gases, lactate, electrolytes, and cardiac biomarkers — let me verify that continuous core temperature monitoring is emphasized, yes, ERC–ESICM explicitly calls for it in comatose patients after ROSC [^117WRogc] [^112Aejuc].

> Now, I will examine hemodynamic optimization; hypotension is consistently associated with worse neurological outcomes, so at minimum I should maintain SBP at least 90 mmHg and MAP at least 65 mmHg while individualizing higher targets based on pre-arrest baseline, myocardial function by point-of-care echocardiography, shock phenotype, and concomitant brain injury; hold on, I should verify the threshold — AHA 2020 indeed supports SBP ≥ 90 and MAP ≥ 65, and AHA–Neurocritical Care 2024 underscores individualized MAP targets informed by cerebral perfusion surrogates and cardiac function [^114Kiatt] [^117EBZMn].

> Temperature management has shifted — wait, I used to reflexively think "cool to 33°C", but I need to check the most recent high-level evidence; TTM2 showed no benefit of targeted hypothermia at 33°C versus normothermia with active fever prevention and noted more adverse events with hypothermia, and ERC–ESICM 2022 prioritizes active fever prevention, stepwise antipyretics with escalation to devices targeting about 37.5°C, avoidance of active rewarming if mildly hypothermic, continuous core monitoring, and controlled rewarming after at least 24 hours; so the default is active normothermia with fever avoidance rather than routine deep hypothermia in unselected patients [^1138yu45] [^116Ep4nE] [^113qMPAW] [^114d6Q2B] [^112Aejuc].

> I will now consider coronary evaluation and revascularization; coronary artery disease underlies many OHCA events, but hold on, let's not jump to universal cath — guidelines recommend immediate angiography for STEMI and for "electrically unstable" patients with suspected ongoing ischemia, with ACC/AHA/SCAI advising revascularization in significant CAD presenting with VF/VT or arrest; for non-STEMI arrests, selection should weigh likelihood of coronary etiology, frailty, neurological severity, and hemodynamics, and the ARREST trial showed no survival benefit to routine expedited transfer to a cardiac arrest center for non-ST-elevation OHCA, emphasizing tailored selection rather than blanket transfer [^115wxj7z] [^112xrzrw] [^116CGoGa].

> Turning to neurological management, I need to ensure seizure surveillance with continuous EEG when available and treat electrographic and clinical seizures, provide adequate sedation (especially during temperature control) to suppress shivering and metabolic demand, and approach neuromuscular blockade carefully; wait, I recall SCCM 2016 said to use peripheral nerve stimulation to titrate blockade during hypothermia — hold on, I should verify — one SCCM statement suggests obtaining peripheral nerve stimulation, but another notes insufficient evidence to recommend it, so I must acknowledge this inconsistency and use clinical endpoints alongside or instead of PNS when evidence is uncertain; moreover, a 2020 randomized trial of early continuous NMB showed no improvement in lactate clearance or outcomes, so routine continuous paralysis is not supported, though short-term NMB remains reasonable for refractory shivering or ventilator dyssynchrony; for prognostication, I should double-check timing — older practice used a minimum 72-hour delay, but with sedation and temperature control confounders we now emphasize a delayed, multimodal approach integrating exam, EEG, evoked potentials, neuroimaging, and biomarkers, and avoid premature withdrawal given heterogeneity of PCABI [^116jhZ6p] [^1112o79X] [^116Cgnbk] [^113hV24y].

> For respiratory strategy, I need to ensure lung-protective ventilation and tightly manage oxygen and carbon dioxide to protect the brain; that means avoiding both hypoxemia and hyperoxia and steering PaCO2 to avoid either cerebral vasoconstriction or vasodilation that could worsen ischemia or edema, while using low tidal volumes and limiting plateau pressures; let me check applicability — post hoc analyses from TTM2 highlight the importance of ventilatory settings in the first 72 hours, and contemporary statements caution that while exact targets remain under study, protective strategies extrapolated from ARDS are prudent in PCAS [^117WRogc] [^117WRogc].

> I will now review other supportive care: maintain glucose to avoid hypoglycemia while preventing severe hyperglycemia spikes, balance fluids to support perfusion without overload, use renal replacement for refractory acidosis, hyperkalemia, or volume, vigilantly surveil for infection during temperature control, and initiate early enteral nutrition as feasible; I should confirm that aggressive multisystem support can still yield good outcomes despite common myocardial dysfunction — yes, the 2024 AHA–Neurocritical Care statements emphasize not withdrawing support prematurely based on early severity signals alone [^117WRogc].

> But wait, what if our one-size-fits-all approach is obscuring benefits in subgroups; heterogeneity is a key theme — phenotyping by arrest mechanism (asphyxial versus dysrhythmic), anatomical vulnerability, EEG signatures, and biomarkers is a research priority to tailor interventions and ensure mechanistic target engagement; ILCOR's 2024 statement explicitly maps the phases of PCABI and calls for timing- and phenotype-matched interventions, and prior literature on asphyxial versus dysrhythmic arrest underscores pathophysiologic differences with implications for management and prognosis [^113hV24y] [^114vEtmd].

> Next, I should address systems of care and metrics; consistent process and outcome measures drive improvement along the Chain of Survival, including timely initiation of temperature control measures with active fever prevention as a tracked process, appropriate time-to-angiography for STEMI, and risk-standardized ROSC and neurologic outcomes to allow fair comparisons across hospitals; hold on, I should verify a ROSC standardization model — GWTG-Resuscitation–based risk-standardization for ROSC has been developed, and AHA 2020 positions post–cardiac arrest care as its own crucial link in the chain [^116otdcW] [^114uCv6n] [^114Kiatt].

> Special populations require adapted protocols; in pediatrics, the same PCAS framework applies but BP targets and temperature management are age-specific and extrapolated cautiously from adult data; in postpartum patients, case series suggest temperature control can be safely completed when indicated, though data are limited; and regarding non-shockable rhythms, hold on, I should verify inclusion — TTM2 included patients without shockable rhythms and ERC–ESICM acknowledges insufficient evidence to exclude them from temperature control strategies aimed at fever prevention [^112576vY] [^1142Wt9b] [^1138yu45] [^113NN5P9].

> Finally, I need to ensure survivorship planning is addressed because survival alone is not enough; early in-ICU rehabilitation, structured cardiac rehabilitation, and systematic screening for cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, and PTSD with family and caregiver support pathways are essential to long-term recovery and quality of life, and health systems should integrate these services into the post–cardiac arrest continuum [^114pfsd9].

Post-cardiac arrest care aims to prevent secondary injury and improve neurologic outcomes through **early, structured critical care**. Key priorities include **hemodynamic stabilization** (MAP ≥ 65 mmHg, SBP ≥ 90 mmHg) [^114Kiatt], targeted temperature management with strict fever prevention [^113qMPAW] (maintain ≤ 37.5°C, avoid > 37.7°C) [^116Ep4nE], and early coronary angiography for suspected ischemia [^115wxj7z]. Ventilation should target **normoxia and normocapnia** [^117WRogc], and seizures must be promptly treated [^117WRogc]. Multimodal neurologic prognostication should be delayed until ≥ 72 hours after rewarming or sedation clearance [^117WRogc]. Early ICU admission, continuous monitoring, and multidisciplinary care are essential to reduce secondary brain injury and improve survival with good neurologic function [^1172uW4N].

---

## Immediate stabilization and monitoring

- **Airway and breathing**: Secure airway and provide mechanical ventilation targeting normoxia (PaO2 75–100 mmHg) and normocapnia (PaCO2 35–45 mmHg) to prevent secondary brain injury [^113MDVbA] [^117WRogc].

- **Circulation**: Maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg and SBP ≥ 90 mmHg using fluids and vasopressors/inotropes as needed [^114Kiatt].

- **Continuous monitoring**: Implement continuous ECG, invasive arterial pressure, core temperature, and frequent neurologic assessments [^112Aejuc].

---

## Targeted temperature management (TTM)

- **Temperature control**: Maintain core temperature ≤ 37.5°C and actively prevent fever (> 37.7°C) in comatose patients after ROSC [^113qMPAW] [^116Ep4nE] [^1138yu45].

- **Cooling methods**: Use surface or endovascular devices; avoid active rewarming in mild hypothermia [^114d6Q2B].

- **Shivering management**: Treat shivering with sedation, analgesia, and neuromuscular blockade as needed [^112veiqk] [^116jhZ6p].

---

## Hemodynamic optimization

- **Blood pressure targets**: Maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg and SBP ≥ 90 mmHg to ensure adequate perfusion [^114Kiatt].

- **Vasoactive support**: Use norepinephrine or epinephrine for vasopressor support; consider inotropes for myocardial dysfunction [^117EBZMn].

- **Echocardiography**: Perform early echocardiography to assess cardiac function and guide therapy [^1172uW4N].

---

## Neurologic management and prognostication

Seizure management includes **continuous EEG monitoring** with prompt treatment using **antiepileptics** [^117WRogc]. Prognostication should be delayed until **≥ 72 hours after rewarming or clearance of sedation** [^113MDVbA] and should use a **multimodal assessment** (clinical exam, EEG, imaging, biomarkers) [^113hV24y].

---

## Identification and treatment of underlying causes

Coronary angiography should be performed **early** in patients with suspected **myocardial ischemia** or ongoing instability, with **revascularization when indicated** [^115wxj7z] [^112xrzrw]. Other causes should also be evaluated and treated, including **reversible factors such as electrolyte disturbances, hypoxia, and toxins** [^111aExtT] [^113vEHMJ].

---

## Multidisciplinary care and rehabilitation

Multidisciplinary team involvement should occur **early**, engaging cardiology, neurology, critical care, and rehabilitation specialists. Rehabilitation should begin **early**, with **psychological support** for patients and families [^114pfsd9].

---

## Complications and outcomes

Complications commonly include **neurologic injury, myocardial dysfunction, infections, and metabolic disturbances**. Outcomes depend on the **initial rhythm**, **arrest duration**, and on the **quality of post-arrest care** [^117WRogc].

---

Post-cardiac arrest care requires a structured, multidisciplinary approach focused on stabilization, temperature control, hemodynamic optimization, and early identification of underlying causes to **improve survival and neurologic outcomes** [^1134uD8L].

### Targeted temperature management and postcardiac arrest care [^112bRALD]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Low credibility.

Despite recent advances, care of the post-cardiac arrest patient remains a challenge. In this article, the authors discuss an approach to the initial care of post-cardiac arrest patients, with particular focus on targeted temperature management (TTM). The article starts with history, physiologic rationale, and the major randomized controlled trials that have shaped guidelines for post-cardiac arrest care. It also reviews controversial topics, including TTM for nonshockable rhythms, TTM dose, and surface versus endovascular cooling. The article concludes with a brief review of other key aspects of post-arrest care: coronary angiography, hemodynamic optimization, ventilator management, and prognostication.

### Door-to-targeted temperature management initiation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A new quality metric in postresuscitation care [^116otdcW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The administration of targeted temperature management (TTM) is considered the standard of care in the treatment of comatose cardiac arrest survivors, particularly those with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest stemming from a shockable rhythm. Despite the lack of high-quality evidence, resuscitation guidelines encourage that TTM also be considered for unresponsive survivors of in-hospital cardiac arrest or cardiac arrest stemming from a nonshockable rhythm, as the intervention appears to provide a net overall benefit.

Despite advances in postresuscitative care and the routine use of TTM, the prognosis of comatose arrest survivors continues to be dismal. The dominant mechanism of death following a cardiac arrest is related to brain injury arising because of the combination of ischemia during the arrest and ensuing ischemia-reperfusion injury on return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The remaining deaths after an arrest are a consequence of circulatory collapse in the setting of shock, resulting from initial cardiac dysfunction that is accompanied by profound vasodilation and multiorgan failure.

The observed benefits of TTM in cardiac arrest are mainly attributed to the reduction of brain metabolism and attenuation of the ischemia-reperfusion cascade, whereas others propose an adjunctive cardioprotective effect. Although a class I recommendation, the optimal TTM prescription for unresponsive arrest survivors remains largely unknown, and practice predominantly mirrors landmark trial proceedings with minor adaptations.

### Pediatric post-cardiac arrest care: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112576vY]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest results in a post-cardiac arrest syndrome, which can evolve in the days to weeks after the return of sustained circulation. The components of post-cardiac arrest syndrome are brain injury, myocardial dysfunction, systemic ischemia/reperfusion response, and persistent precipitating pathophysiology. Pediatric post-cardiac arrest care focuses on anticipating, identifying, and treating this complex physiology to improve survival and neurological outcomes.

This scientific statement on post-cardiac arrest care is the result of a consensus process that included specialists in pediatric and adult emergency medicine, critical care, cardiac critical care, cardiology, neurology, and nursing. These professionals analyzed the past 20 years of peer-reviewed published literature on pediatric cardiac arrest, adult cardiac arrest, and pediatric critical illness.

The statement summarizes the epidemiology, pathophysiology, management, and prognostication after the return of sustained circulation following cardiac arrest and provides consensus on the evidence supporting elements of pediatric post-cardiac arrest care.

### Targeted temperature management in postresuscitation care after incorporating results of the TTM2 trial [^1138yu45]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

Cardiac arrest still accounts for a substantial proportion of cardiovascular-related deaths and is associated with a tremendous risk of neurological injury and, among the few survivors, poor quality of life. Critical determinants of survival and long-term functional status after cardiac arrest are the timely initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the use of an external defibrillator for patients with a shockable rhythm. Despite ongoing efforts to improve cardiac arrest response systems and elaborate postresuscitation algorithms, outcomes are still far from satisfactory.

Targeted temperature management between 32 °C and 36 °C has been one of the main therapeutic strategies to improve neurological outcomes in postresuscitation care. This recommendation has been mainly based on two small randomized trials published 20 years ago. Most recent data derived from the TTM2 (Targeted Hypothermia Versus Targeted Normothermia After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest) trial, which included 1861 patients, challenge this strategy. The trial showed no benefit of targeted hypothermia at 33 °C over normothermia at 36 °C to 37.5 °C with fever prevention. Because temperature management at lower temperatures also correlated with an increased risk of side effects without any benefit in the TTM2 trial, a modification of the guidelines with harmonizing temperature management to normothermia might be necessary.

### Critical care management of patients after cardiac arrest: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association and Neurocritical Care Society [^117WRogc]. Neurocritical Care (2024). High credibility.

Cardiac arrest (CA) affects over 600,000 people in the United States annually, with a worldwide annual incidence ranging from 30 to 97 individuals per 100,000 population. Intensive care management of CA survivors is crucial as it significantly influences survival and neurological outcomes. Although outcomes for patients with sudden CA have improved, overall survival remains low, and the quality of life for survivors is often compromised. In 2020, the overall survival rate to hospital discharge for adults resuscitated from out-of-hospital CA was 9%, while it was 23% for those with in-hospital CA.

Research and advancements in care have focused on the chain of survival measures to enhance CA resuscitation: recognition of CA and activation of emergency response, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with emphasis on high-quality chest compressions, early defibrillation, basic and advanced life support, post-CA care, and recovery. Emphasis has been placed on early response with the goal of achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) as quickly as possible. Achieving ROSC marks the beginning of comprehensive, multisystem care for CA survivors. Upon achieving ROSC, the majority of CA survivors remain unresponsive, indicating significant brain injury. Unfortunately, the overall certainty of evidence regarding the benefit of many interventions after ROSC is limited.

Guidelines offer few strong recommendations concerning post-CA care due to the breadth of available literature and limited certainty of evidence. The guidelines writing processes consist of a structured framework to transform evidence.

Cardiac arrest (CA) affects over 600,000 people in the United States annually, with a worldwide annual incidence of 30 to 97 individuals per 100,000 population. Intensive care management of CA survivors is important and influences survival and neurological outcomes. Although there has been improvement in outcomes of patients with sudden CA, overall survival continues to be low, and the quality of life of survivors is affected. The overall survival to hospital discharge in 2020 in adults resuscitated from out-of-hospital CA was 9%, and in those with in-hospital CA, it was 23%.

Research and advancement of care have focused on the chain of survival measures to improve CA resuscitation: recognition of CA and activation of emergency response, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with emphasis on high-quality chest compressions, early defibrillation, and basic and advanced life support, post-CA care, and recovery. The focus has been on early response with the goal of achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) as soon as possible. Achieving ROSC is just the start of comprehensive, multisystem care for survivors of CA. On achieving ROSC, the majority of CA survivors remain unresponsive, a marker of significant brain injury. Unfortunately, the overall certainty of evidence for the benefit of many interventions after ROSC is limited.

Guidelines provide few strong recommendations about post-CA care because of the scope of available literature and limited certainty of evidence. The guidelines writing processes consist of a structured framework to transform evidence into a clinical context.

### Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient [^116jhZ6p]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cardiac arrest, specifically in post-resuscitation care involving neuromuscular blockade, the SCCM 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining peripheral nerve stimulation. This should be used in conjunction with the assessment of other clinical findings, such as the triggering of the ventilator and the degree of shivering, to evaluate the level of neuromuscular blockade in patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia.

### The pathophysiologies of asphyxial vs dysrhythmic cardiac arrest: Implications for resuscitation and post-event management [^114vEtmd]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest is not a uniform condition, and significant heterogeneity exists among victims regarding its cause. Primary cardiac (dysrhythmic) and asphyxial causes are together responsible for most cases of cardiac arrest across all age groups. This article aims to review the pathophysiologic differences between dysrhythmic and asphyxial cardiac arrest in the pre-arrest period, during the no-flow state, and after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

- **Methods**: The electronic databases of PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane were searched for relevant literature and studies.

- **Results/discussion**: Significant differences exist between dysrhythmic and asphyxial cardiac arrest regarding their pathophysiologic pathways, which consequently affect the post-resuscitation period. Laboratory data indicate that asphyxial cardiac arrest leads to more widespread post-resuscitation brain damage compared with dysrhythmic cardiac arrest. Regarding post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction, few studies have addressed a comparison of the two conditions, with controversial results.

- **Conclusions**: Asphyxial cardiac arrest differs significantly from dysrhythmic cardiac arrest concerning pathophysiologic mechanisms, neuropathologic damage, post-resuscitation organ dysfunction, and response to therapy. Both conditions should be considered and treated in different manners.

### Cardiac arrest in pigs with 48 hours of post-resuscitation care induced by 2 methods of myocardial infarction: A methodological description [^113C8DE1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Recent systematic reviews have shown that cardiac arrest animal research often lacks clinically relevant features and is frequently judged as having a high risk of bias. Clinical relevance in the setting of cardiac arrest concerns, among other aspects, the induction method of cardiac arrest, basic and advanced life support, as well as post‐cardiac arrest care. The most prevalent cause of out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest is myocardial infarction. Despite this, the most commonly used induction methods in cardiac arrest animal models are pacing‐induced arrhythmias and asphyxia. In a review of 490 studies, myocardial infarction was only used in 2% of all studies. The same review found that, related to post‐resuscitation care, only 13% used organ‐supportive measures, 4% targeted temperature management (TTM), and for the large animal models, the median post‐resuscitation observation time was merely 4 hours. Hence, there is an unmet need for clinically relevant large‐animal cardiac arrest models to ensure that promising interventions are rigorously tested before translation into clinical studies.

There is a growing number of randomized clinical trials testing cardiac arrest interventions. Despite this, only a minority of pre‐clinically tested pharmacological interventions actually advance to clinical testing, and experimental positive results often translate unsuccessfully. If the quality of results from preclinical studies could be improved, this could increase the likelihood of translating positive results to clinical trials.

### Big five strategies for survival following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^113aM7U3]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2020). Low credibility.

In contrast, several large-scale studies have shown that it is relatively easy and extremely cost-effective to increase the number of survivors with good neurological outcomes following sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). This improvement is not achieved with drugs and devices but through robust data on cardiac arrest incidence and survival, political interventions, and conceptual system changes aimed at strengthening each ring of the 'chain of survival' These studies have focused on cultural changes and nationwide campaigns and interventions, which we have summarized as the 'big five strategies for survival' following SCA. With international implementation of these 'big five for survival', we believe that it is possible to save several hundreds of thousands of lives after SCA every year worldwide. The 'big five strategies for survival' following SCA are detailed below.

1. **Community programmes to increase bystander CPR**: Local, national, and international campaigns aim to increase lay CPR rates. Initiatives include 'Kids Save Lives' (schoolchildren education in resuscitation), the 'World Restart a Heart (WRAH)' initiative, short CPR courses for adults, and media and press campaigns. Because the brain can normally survive only for 3 to 5 minutes without any damage, and emergency medical services (EMS) often arrive later, one major focus to increase survival is the instigation of bystander CPR. This 'bridging' of the victim by bystander intervention until EMS arrival will slow down the clock of cerebral hypoxia and preserve the brain in this 'time window for lay resuscitation'. In a minority of countries, bystander CPR rates are above 60%. In most countries worldwide, however, this rate is much lower.

### Outcome measures utilized in clinical trials of interventions for post-cardiac arrest syndrome: a systematic review [^111QZMxt]. Resuscitation (2009). Low credibility.

The post-cardiac arrest syndrome, defined as the period of critical illness following the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), presents a promising window of opportunity for clinical trials of therapeutic interventions to improve outcomes from cardiac arrest. However, the methodological rigor of post-ROSC trials, as well as the ability to compare or pool data on treatment effects across studies, requires consistent and appropriate outcome measures. We aimed to determine the degree of uniformity of outcome measures in clinical trials of post-ROSC interventions.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, conference proceedings, and clinical trial registrations using a comprehensive strategy. We identified experimental or quasi-experimental trials testing post-ROSC interventions in adults. Four authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality using standardized instruments.

- **Results**: The search yielded 33 potential studies, of which 13 randomized controlled trials (n = 1937) were included in the final analysis. Seven trials tested pharmacologic therapies, and six tested non-pharmacologic therapies. Our main finding is that heterogeneity in the selection and reporting of outcomes limited the comparability of results across studies. No two trials used exactly the same primary outcome, and the timing of measurement varied widely. We found only two commonalities: indices of functional survival were used rather than survival alone, and ordinal scales of neurological function were collapsed into clinically meaningful groups ("good" versus other outcomes).

### Cardiac arrest and therapeutic hypothermia [^114eZ63q]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Therapeutic hypothermia for patients who remain comatose following resuscitation from a cardiac arrest improves both survival and neurologic outcomes. Although this therapy has been incorporated into the guidelines for routine post-resuscitation care and has been in clinical use for over a decade, significant questions and controversies remain. In this review, we discuss these questions in the context of the evidence and provide a practical framework to help guide clinicians.

### Association between duration of resuscitation and favorable outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: Implications for prolonging or terminating resuscitation [^11145arS]. Circulation (2016). High credibility.

Little evidence guides the appropriate duration of resuscitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and case features justifying longer or shorter durations are ill-defined. We estimated the impact of resuscitation duration on the probability of favorable functional outcome in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using a large, multicenter cohort.

- **Methods**: This study was a secondary analysis of a North American, single-blind, multicenter, cluster-randomized clinical trial (ROC-PRIMED [Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Prehospital Resuscitation Using an Impedance Valve and Early Versus Delayed]) of consecutive adults with nontraumatic, emergency medical services-treated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The primary exposure was the duration of resuscitation in minutes (from the onset of professional resuscitation to the return of spontaneous circulation [ROSC] or termination of resuscitation). The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge with a favorable outcome, defined as a modified Rankin scale (mRS) score of 0–3. Subjects were additionally classified as survival with an unfavorable outcome (mRS score of 4–5), ROSC without survival (mRS score of 6), or without ROSC. Subject accrual was plotted as a function of resuscitation duration, and the dynamic probability of a favorable outcome at discharge was estimated for the whole cohort and subgroups. Adjusted logistic regression models tested the association between resuscitation duration and survival with a favorable outcome.

- **Results**: The primary cohort included 11,368 subjects (median age, 69 years [interquartile range, 56–81 years]; 7,121 men [62.6%]).

The results section appears incomplete in the original text, and further details were not provided.

### Cardiopulmonary resuscitation and management of cardiac arrest [^113MDVbA]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

The best chance of survival with a good neurological outcome after cardiac arrest is afforded by early recognition and high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), early defibrillation of ventricular fibrillation (VF), and subsequent care in a specialist center. Compression-only CPR should be used by responders who are unable or unwilling to perform mouth-to-mouth ventilations. After the first defibrillator shock, further rhythm checks and defibrillation attempts should be performed after 2 minutes of CPR.

The underlying cause of cardiac arrest can be identified and treated during CPR. Drugs have a limited effect on long-term outcomes after cardiac arrest, although epinephrine improves the success of resuscitation, and amiodarone increases the success of defibrillation for refractory VF. Supraglottic airway devices are an alternative to tracheal intubation, which should be attempted only by skilled rescuers.

Care after cardiac arrest includes controlled reoxygenation, therapeutic hypothermia for comatose survivors, percutaneous coronary intervention, circulatory support, and control of blood-glucose levels and seizures. Prognostication in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest requires a careful, multimodal approach using clinical and electrophysiological assessments after at least 72 hours.

### Target temperature management after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest — a randomized, parallel-group, assessor-blinded clinical trial — rationale and design [^1125dWdg]. American Heart Journal (2012). High credibility.

Experimental animal studies and previous randomized trials suggest an improvement in mortality and neurologic function with induced hypothermia after cardiac arrest. International guidelines advocate the use of a target temperature management of 32°C to 34°C for 12 to 24 hours after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. A systematic review indicates that the evidence for recommending this intervention is inconclusive, and the GRADE level of evidence is low. Previous trials were small, with a high risk of bias, evaluated select populations, and did not treat hyperthermia in the control groups. The optimal target temperature management strategy is not known.

- **Methods**: The TTM trial is an investigator-initiated, international, randomized, parallel-group, and assessor-blinded clinical trial designed to enroll at least 850 adult, unconscious patients resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of a presumed cardiac cause. The patients will be randomized to a target temperature management of either 33°C or 36°C after return of spontaneous circulation. In both groups, the intervention will last 36 hours. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality at maximal follow-up. The main secondary outcomes are the composite outcome of all-cause mortality and poor neurologic function (cerebral performance categories 3 and 4) at hospital discharge and at 180 days, as well as cognitive status and quality of life at 180 days, assessment of safety, and harm.

- **Discussion**: The TTM trial will investigate the potential benefit and harm of two target temperature strategies, both avoiding hyperthermia.

### Management of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome [^114GYijj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Recent advances in resuscitation science have revolutionized the care of cardiac arrest patients. Dramatic departures from time-honored advanced cardiac life support therapies, such as cardiocerebral resuscitation and bundled post-arrest care, have given rise to a new paradigm of resuscitation practices, which has boosted the rate of neurologically intact survival.

- **Objectives**: This article reviews the pathophysiology of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome, the collective pathophysiology after return of spontaneous circulation, and presents management pearls specifically for the emergency physician. This growing area of scientific inquiry must be managed appropriately to sustain improved outcomes.

- **Discussion**: The emergency physician must understand this pathophysiology, manage resuscitated patients according to the latest evidence, and coordinate with appropriate inpatient resources.

- **Conclusion**: The new approach to cardiac arrest care is predicated on a chain of survival that spans the spectrum of care from the prehospital arena through the emergency, intensive, and inpatient settings. The emergency physician is a crucial link in this chain.

### Door-to-targeted temperature management initiation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A new quality metric in postresuscitation care [^113r3fAF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The timing of hypothermia initiation after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) has been extensively evaluated. Although animal data suggested an incremental benefit with cooling initiated as early as within 15 minutes from ROSC, human observation studies have reported mixed results. Although some reports suggested that targeted temperature management (TTM) administration in this setting was time sensitive, others failed to identify such an association. The excitement about faster TTM initiation after ROSC was tempered by the negative results of seven randomized studies comparing prehospital cooling, either during arrest or shortly after, against standard hospital initiation of TTM.

The interpretation of these trials was hampered by important design flaws, including small sample sizes, lack of blinding of outcomes assessment, absence of mandated rewarming protocols, and a significant proportion of patients who did not receive the intended treatment. In addition, concerns exist that the prehospital induction with large volumes of ice-cold solution, as the designated test intervention, might have adverse consequences that confounded the results. Consequently, whether earlier initiation with TTM provides incremental benefit in cardiac arrest survivors remains debatable.

### Clinical heterogeneity and phenotyping of post-cardiac arrest brain injury: One size may not fit all [^111Zedqd]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Post-cardiac arrest brain injury (PCABI) emanates from the injurious pathophysiologic sequelae that take place during and after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Regrettably, identification of efficacious management strategies to mitigate PCABI has been disappointing, with numerous well-conducted randomized control trials yielding neutral results. The reasons for this observation are likely multifactorial; however, increasingly patient and disease-specific heterogeneity is recognized as a crucial factor in clinical decision-making.

Traditionally, PCABI has been stratified based upon simple historical characteristics (e.g. location of cardiac arrest, initial rhythm, witnessed vs. unwitnessed) that inadequately reflect in vivo PCABI severity or responses to clinical interventions within individual patients. It is therefore increasingly clear that this approach to PCABI is insufficient.

In other syndromes, such as sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome, attempts to identify early "phenotypes" of patients reflect the growing recognition of considerable between-patient heterogeneity in the disease mechanisms and response to therapeutic interventions. A similar approach should be taken with PCABI. In this review, we describe the clinical heterogeneity and phenotypes of PCABI as related to the underlying pathophysiology, selective anatomical vulnerability, and electrographic patterns. The overarching aim of the review is to propose a shift to expeditious phenotyping of PCABI severity that focuses on assessing in vivo severity and patterns of injury that could be used for future interventions.

### Improving survival from cardiac arrest: A review of contemporary practice and challenges [^1156sjiX]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest is a common and lethal condition frequently encountered by emergency medicine providers. Resuscitation of persons after cardiac arrest remains challenging, and outcomes remain poor overall. Successful resuscitation hinges on timely, high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The optimal method of providing chest compressions and ventilator support during cardiac arrest remains uncertain.

Prompt and effective defibrillation of ventricular arrhythmias is one of the few effective therapies available for the treatment of cardiac arrest. Despite numerous studies over several decades, no specific drug delivered during cardiac arrest has been shown to improve neurologically intact survival. Extracorporeal circulation can rescue a minority of highly selected patients with refractory cardiac arrest.

Management of pulseless electrical activity is associated with poor outcomes; however, it is hoped that a more targeted diagnostic approach based on electrocardiography and bedside cardiac ultrasonography may improve survival. The evolution of postresuscitation care appears to have improved cardiac arrest outcomes in patients who are successfully resuscitated.

The initial approach to early stabilization includes standard measures, such as support of pulmonary function, hemodynamic stabilization, and rapid diagnostic assessment. Coronary angiography is often indicated because of the high frequency of unstable coronary artery disease in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest and should be performed early after resuscitation.

### Post-cardiac arrest syndrome [^1179irgH]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2023). Low credibility.

Post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS) is a multicomponent entity affecting many who survive an initial period of resuscitation following cardiac arrest. This focused review explores some of the strategies for mitigating the effects of PCAS following the return of spontaneous circulation. We consider the evidence for controlled oxygenation, strategies for blood-pressure targets, the timing of coronary reperfusion, and the evidence for temperature control and treatment of seizures.

Despite several large trials investigating specific strategies to improve outcomes after cardiac arrest, many questions remain unanswered. Results of some studies suggest that interventions may benefit specific subgroups of cardiac arrest patients, but the optimal timing and duration of many interventions remain unknown. The role of intracranial pressure monitoring has been the subject of only a few studies, and its benefits remain unclear. Research aimed at improving the management of PCAS is ongoing.

### Methods of the 7 national audit project (NAP7) of the Royal College of Anaesthetists: Peri-operative cardiac arrest [^116FtuWu]. Anaesthesia (2022). Low credibility.

The review panel refers to published guidelines as indications for best practices, including, but not limited to, those from the Resuscitation Council (UK) and European Resuscitation Council for adult and paediatric advanced life support, Association of Anaesthetists Quick Reference Handbook, and specialist society guidelines (e.g. cardiac advanced life support), and guidance covering treatment escalation plans and end‐of‐life care (e.g. ReSPECT). The panel judged the overall quality of care as 'good', 'poor', 'good and poor', or 'unclear' based on guidelines, the specific circumstances of the case, and ultimately by panel consensus.

Previous NAPs have reviewed approximately 200 cases. In NAP7, up to 1000 cases may be reported. Once the review process is established, a complementary rapid review process will be used to allow learning from all cases to be incorporated into the final report. Rapid review cases will be assessed by two panel members independently. Where the case requires subspecialty expertise, one reviewer will be from the relevant stakeholder group. The review outcome will focus on the quality of care and learning points. If either panel member records that the case should be reviewed by the full panel or there is a notable disagreement between panel members in their assessment, the case will be submitted for full panel review.

### Expedited transfer to a cardiac arrest centre for non-ST-elevation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (ARREST): a UK prospective, multicentre, parallel, randomised clinical trial [^116CGoGa]. Lancet (2023). High credibility.

Three participants in the cardiac arrest centre group and one in the standard care group did not have known mortality status at 30 days because they were discharged between days 11 and 21 without follow-up; therefore, primary outcome data were available for 411 (95%) of 431 participants in the cardiac arrest centre group and 412 (96%) of 431 participants in the standard care group.

The 30-day all-cause mortality was 258 (63%) of 411 in the cardiac arrest centre group and 258 (63%) of 412 in the standard care group (unadjusted RR for survival 1.00 [95% CI 0.90 to 1.11], p = 0.96; risk difference 0.2% [95% CI –6.5 to 6.8]). There was no difference in 3-month all-cause mortality between the two groups (RR 1.02 [95% CI 0.92 to 1.12]; risk difference 1.0% [95% CI –5.6 to 7.5]). The Kaplan-Meier plot for all-cause mortality at 3 months is provided in figure 2.

### Post-cardiac arrest physiology and management in the neonatal intensive care unit [^111UhiFH]. Resuscitation (2021). Low credibility.

The importance of high-quality post-cardiac arrest care is well described in adult and pediatric populations, but data are lacking to inform post-cardiac arrest care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The objective of this study was to describe post-cardiac arrest physiology and management in a quaternary NICU.

- **Methods**: This retrospective descriptive study examined post-cardiac arrest physiology and management. Data were abstracted from electronic medical records and an institutional resuscitation database. A cardiac arrest was defined as ≥ 1 minute of chest compressions. Only index arrests were analyzed. Descriptive statistics were used to report patient, intra-arrest, and post-arrest characteristics.

- **Results**: There were 110 index cardiac arrests during the 5-year study period from January 2017 to February 2021. The majority (69%) were acute respiratory compromise leading to cardiopulmonary arrest (ARC-CPA) and 26% were primary cardiopulmonary arrests (CPA). Vital sign monitoring within 24 hours post-arrest was variable, especially in terms of non-invasive blood pressure frequency (median 5, range 1–44 measurements). There was a high prevalence of hypothermia (73% of arrest survivors). There was substantial variability in laboratory frequency within 24 hours post-arrest. Patients with primary CPA received significantly more lab testing and had a higher prevalence of acidosis (pH < 7.2) than those with ARC-CPA.

- **Conclusions**: Significant variation in post-arrest management and a high prevalence of hypothermia were identified. These findings highlight the need for post-arrest management guidelines specific to the NICU.

### Meta-analysis of the usefulness of therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest [^115pq1w6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Despite guidelines recommending therapeutic hypothermia (TH) for post-cardiac arrest comatose patients, its use remains limited. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have reported conflicting results on the efficacy of TH, prompting us to conduct an updated meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of TH in post-cardiac arrest patients. We searched electronic databases for RCTs comparing TH (32°C to 34°C) with controls (normothermia or temperature ≥ 36°C) in comatose patients who sustained cardiac arrest. Mortality and neurological outcomes were the outcomes of interest. We used random effects meta-analysis to estimate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

Eight RCTs with a total of 2,026 patients (TH n = 1,025 and control n = 1,001) were included. Irrespective of initial rhythm, TH was associated with a significant reduction in poor neurological outcomes (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.98; p = 0.02) without any difference in mortality (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.03; p = 0.17). In patients with initial shockable rhythm compared with control, TH reduced mortality (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.99; p = 0.04) and poor neurological outcomes (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.99; p = 0.04). In patients with an initial nonshockable rhythm, TH was associated with decreased poor neurological outcomes after excluding one trial (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.00; p = 0.05). In conclusion, TH is associated with improved neurological outcomes in all patients sustaining cardiac arrest and decreased mortality in patients with initial shockable rhythm.

### Post-cardiac arrest care [^114zDfCY]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Low credibility.

A structured approach to post-cardiac arrest care is needed. Immediate goals include obtaining a blood pressure reading and ECG promptly after the return of spontaneous circulation. More advanced goals involve minimizing CNS injury, managing cardiovascular dysfunction, reducing systemic ischemic/reperfusion injury, and identifying and treating the underlying cause of the arrest. This article summarizes the understanding of hemodynamic, neurologic, and metabolic abnormalities encountered in post-arrest patients.

### Pre-arrest and intra-arrest prognostic factors associated with survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^11726sqQ]. BMJ (2019). High credibility.

Cardiac arrest refers to the cessation of mechanical heart function and effective blood circulation, and is typically classified as either out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or in-hospital cardiac arrest. Although evidence from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is often extrapolated to in-hospital cardiac arrest, the epidemiology and determinants of success might differ accordingly. Compared to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, data on the incidence and survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest are limited. Most studies report an incidence of one to six events per 1000 hospital admissions. Survival to discharge ranges between 12% and 25%, with increased survival recently reported. One-year outcomes are similar, with only modest increases over the past decade.

Prognostic factors associated with survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest are an important focus of ongoing research. Patients admitted to the hospital have increasingly complex conditions, presenting unique challenges when managing in-hospital cardiac arrest. Clinicians have to rapidly process many factors related to preadmission status, including age, sex, and comorbidities, as well as factors related to the arrest itself, such as whether the arrest was witnessed or monitored and the initial rhythm, to determine the effectiveness of ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Additionally, clinicians need to discuss the expected prognosis after in-hospital cardiac arrest with patients at the time of hospital admission to inform care plans and whether to include cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the event of cardiac arrest.

### Clinical heterogeneity and phenotyping of post cardiac arrest brain injury: One size may not fit all [^115p1YhW]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Post-cardiac arrest brain injury (PCABI) arises during and following resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Among survivors, it is the most common determinant of clinical outcome. PCABI is associated with high mortality and significant long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae, ranging from states of impaired consciousness to psychiatric illness encompassing depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anxiety. These long-term consequences are associated with a significant increase in healthcare costs and a burden for patients and their families. Recently, the incidence of PCABI has been increasing with aging populations worldwide and widespread increases in overdose-related cardiac arrest.

Small improvements in PCABI outcomes are attributed to on-scene interventions, such as immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation. Regrettably, outcomes related to interventions in the intensive care setting have not appreciably improved, despite advancements in treating other major critical illnesses, such as sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome. This finding is likely due to a paucity of efficacious therapies and management strategies for PCABI.

Recently, PCABI clinical trials have yielded numerous neutral trial results. This could be attributed to underpowered studies and overly optimistic effect sizes. However, it is possible that between-patient heterogeneity of PCABI has also been underappreciated. A central theme in the provision of healthcare in critical care is providing consistent medical interventions to all patients; however, it is increasingly recognized…

### Safely completed therapeutic hypothermia in postpartum cardiac arrest survivors [^1142Wt9b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Recently, therapeutic hypothermia (TH) has been used as one of the most important treatments for post–cardiac arrest care. Although TH induces several complications, it is performed across various medical fields. The following series of case studies describes two cases of postpartum cardiac arrest treated with TH without serious complications. Although one patient exhibited coagulopathy and bleeding tendencies, this report suggests further application for TH. Therefore, emergency physicians should consider TH for the treatment of postpartum cardiac arrest.

### Critical care management of patients after cardiac arrest: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association and Neurocritical Care Society [^117EBZMn]. Neurocritical Care (2024). High credibility.

Although post-cardiac arrest (CA) myocardial dysfunction is common, it is not correlated with survival or neurological outcome, indicating that patients can still achieve positive results with aggressive critical care management of their cardiac disease. The management of patients with post-CA cardiac dysfunction lacks high-certainty evidence-based guidance. This excerpt addresses important topics such as using echocardiography to guide ­hemodynamic resuscitation after CA, the emerging field of mechanical circulatory support after CA, and determining which patients without ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction may be considered for catheterization.

- **Hemodynamics, monitoring, and mechanical circulatory support**: As discussed in the section, "Neurological Management in the Intensive Care Unit: Brain Oxygenation, Perfusion, Edema, and ICP", the optimal blood pressure target to improve CA outcomes and the means to achieve these targets have been significant research interests over the past decade. Recent studies have focused on the association between blood pressure and neurological function. Specifically, they have evaluated surrogates of brain perfusion and oxygenation, under the premise that using physiological data points that assess cerebral oxygen delivery and perfusion may help guide blood pressure thresholds and improve neurological outcomes. Individual patient characteristics, including the degree of myocardial dysfunction, underlying cause of shock, baseline prearrest blood pressure, and concomitant brain injury, are evaluated when post-CA mean arterial pressure (MAP) targets are set.

### The immunology of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome [^113WtdwJ]. Resuscitation (2022). Low credibility.

Patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest often experience brain injury, myocardial dysfunction, and systemic ischemia-reperfusion injury, collectively termed the post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS). To improve outcomes, potential therapies must be administered early in the post-arrest course and provide broad cytoprotection, as ischemia-reperfusion injury affects all organ systems. Our understanding of the immune system's contributions to PCAS has expanded, with animal models detailing biologically plausible mechanisms of secondary injury. These models also examine the protective effects of immunomodulatory drugs and how immune dysregulation underlies increased infection susceptibility after arrest. In this narrative review, we discuss the dysregulated immune response in PCAS, human trials of targeted immunomodulation therapies, and future directions for immunomodulation following cardiac arrest.

### Excluding the elephant in the room: Cardiac arrest [^112Z9DZ1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

What are the barriers to creating parallel efforts for patients with cardiac arrest? Guideline recommendations for these patients, especially those with post-resuscitation ST elevations on ECG, are limited but do exist. They call for targeted temperature management as soon as possible and immediate angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention when indicated. These guidelines have been supported and codified by recently published performance and quality measures for acute myocardial infarction. However, even these recommendations are debated among practitioners and are challenging to measure. Readily identifiable, measurable, and achievable goals for postarrest care in STEMI are not yet established. They require further and more comprehensive evaluation of both therapies and processes of care.

Preliminary and ongoing studies are evaluating potential strategies and metrics for postarrest care, ranging from prehospital targeted temperature management to direct transport of patients with arrest to percutaneous coronary intervention–capable hospitals. These studies carry promise, but much work remains to be done. Standards of care and measurable quality metrics are needed for cardiac arrest, similar to those established for STEMI. Perhaps existing quality improvement networks, like Mission: Lifeline, can be leveraged to help identify these standards and metrics. Expanding data collection or specifying particular elements for patients with cardiac arrest within existing or emerging registries may help identify opportunities to improve care.

### Improving outcomes after post-cardiac arrest brain injury: A scientific statement from the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation [^113hV24y]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

This scientific statement presents a conceptual framework for the pathophysiology of post-cardiac arrest brain injury, explores reasons for previous failure to translate preclinical data to clinical practice, and outlines potential paths forward. Post-cardiac arrest brain injury is characterized by four distinct but overlapping phases: ischemic depolarization, reperfusion repolarization, dysregulation, and recovery and repair. Previous research has been challenging due to the limitations of laboratory models; heterogeneity in the patient populations enrolled; overoptimistic estimation of treatment effects leading to suboptimal sample sizes; timing and route of intervention delivery; limited or absent evidence that the intervention has engaged the mechanistic target; and heterogeneity in post-resuscitation care, prognostication, and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments.

Future trials must tailor their interventions to the subset of patients most likely to benefit and deliver this intervention at the appropriate time, through the appropriate route, and at the appropriate dose. The complexity of post-cardiac arrest brain injury suggests that monotherapies are unlikely to be as successful as multimodal neuroprotective therapies. Biomarkers should be developed to identify patients with the targeted mechanism of injury, to quantify its severity, and to measure the response to therapy. Studies need to be adequately powered to detect effect sizes that are realistic and meaningful to patients, their families, and clinicians. Study designs should be optimized to accelerate the evaluation of interventions.

### Sudden cardiac arrest survivorship: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114pfsd9]. Circulation (2020). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest systems of care are successfully coordinating community, emergency medical services, and hospital efforts to improve the process of care for patients who have had a cardiac arrest. As a result, the number of people surviving sudden cardiac arrest is increasing. However, physical, cognitive, and emotional effects of surviving cardiac arrest may linger for months or years. Systematic recommendations stop short of addressing partnerships needed to care for patients and caregivers after medical stabilization. This document expands the cardiac arrest resuscitation system of care to include patients, caregivers, and rehabilitative healthcare partnerships, which are central to cardiac arrest survivorship.

### Ventilatory settings in the initial 72 h and their association with outcome in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients: A preplanned secondary analysis of the targeted hypothermia versus targeted normothermia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (TTM2) trial [^11423DZt]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Post-cardiac arrest syndrome is characterized by high mortality and morbidity rates, and several strategies have been implemented with the aim to improve survival and neurological outcomes. Among these, research has focused on the optimization of respiratory function and the prevention of pulmonary complications, which are common in this population.

Mechanical ventilation aims to provide appropriate gas exchange (arterial partial pressure of oxygen, PaO2, and arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, PaCO2), which can have important effects on the development of secondary brain damage, cerebral blood flow, cerebrovascular dynamics, and the patient's survival rate. The pathophysiology of cardiac arrest and its systemic effects, as well as the relationship between ventilatory settings and cerebral hemodynamics after resuscitation, is complex and not completely elucidated.

The literature on the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and non-ARDS populations has highlighted the importance of using lung protective strategies (i.e. low tidal volume, low plateau pressure) to optimize patient outcomes. Only a few, mostly small, studies have focused on the effect of mechanical ventilator settings on outcomes after cardiac arrest, with no definitive conclusions. Moreover, the role of parameters such as driving pressure (DP) and mechanical power (MP), which have been shown to be potentially associated with ventilator-induced lung injury and worsened outcomes in the non-ARDS and ARDS populations, has not been investigated so far in patients after cardiac arrest.

### Do out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients have increased chances of survival when transported to a cardiac resuscitation center [^115Cj3ip]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The initial electronic search yielded 2,727 references. A title and abstract screening left 31 potentially eligible citations. The search of gray literature, the second electronic search, and communications with authors of potentially eligible articles yielded an additional 5 citations, resulting in 36 total citations for full‐text review. Among these articles, a total of 24 were excluded for the following reasons: absence of comparison between cardiac centers and non-cardiac centers (17), unknown availability of targeted temperature management (TTM) (2), only abstract published (2), review article (1), availability of more recently published data from the same cohort (1), and included in‐hospital cardiac arrest (1). A total of 12 studies were included in the narrative review and 11 in the meta‐analysis.

- **Included studies**: All included articles were nonrandomized observational studies. It was possible to extract data regarding survival for 10 studies and regarding neurologic outcomes for 5 studies. One study only provided hazard ratios, which prevented its inclusion in the meta‐analysis. Despite adjusted results being available for all included studies, unadjusted results were used in some analyses or sensitivity analyses for 2 studies because they were not provided for all the outcomes or populations pertaining to the present study.

### Risk-standardizing rates of return of spontaneous circulation for in-hospital cardiac arrest to facilitate hospital comparisons [^1144JXpH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Within a large national registry, we derived and validated a risk‐adjustment model for hospital rates of sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after in‐hospital cardiac arrest. The model was based on 10 clinical variables that are commonly used in clinical care and easy to collect. Moreover, the model demonstrated good discrimination and excellent calibration. Importantly, our study adhered to recommended standards for public reporting by utilizing hierarchical models and was based on a contemporary cohort of patients with in‐hospital cardiac arrest. This risk‐standardization methodology provides a mechanism to compare rates of ROSC across hospitals and to assess the impact of hospital resuscitation initiatives on ROSC rates.

The American Heart Association's Get With The Guidelines (GWTG)‐Resuscitation national registry has developed a number of target benchmarks to highlight hospitals with exceptional performance. Most of these performance metrics relate to processes of care, such as the time to defibrillation or administration of epinephrine and the time to initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and should be independent of patient case‐mix. However, survival outcomes such as ROSC after in‐hospital cardiac arrest may be heavily influenced by patient case‐mix, especially by variables like age, initial cardiac arrest rhythm, and illness severity at the time of cardiac arrest. As a result, differences in unadjusted hospital rates of ROSC could simply arise from differences in patient case‐mix. At the time of writing, a risk‐standardization model to facilitate comparisons of ROSC rates across hospitals does not exist.

### Target temperature in post-arrest comatose patients: Is something changed in the postpandemic era [^115pgG4e]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

The recommended target temperature for treating comatose patients after cardiac arrest has recently changed. We analyzed the impact on the neurological outcome of a change in the target temperature from July 2021.

- **Material and methods**: This was a retrospective analysis comparing the discharge status of 78 patients with a target temperature of 33 °C (Group 1) with that of 24 patients with a target temperature of 36.5 °C (Group 2). Pearson chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests were used.

- **Results**: The initial rhythm was defibrillable in 65% of Group 1 and 71% of Group 2, and cardiac arrest was witnessed in 93% of Group 1 and 96% of Group 2. There was an adverse outcome (death or vegetative state) in 37 patients in Group 1 (47%) compared to 18 in Group 2 (74%) (Pearson chi-square 5.612, p = 0.018).

- **Conclusions**: In our series of patients, the temperature control target change from 33 °C to 36.5 °C was associated with a worse neurological outcome. Further studies are needed to evaluate the outcome of a generalized modification of temperature control targets in comatose patients after cardiac arrest in our postpandemic era.

### Clinical heterogeneity and phenotyping of post cardiac arrest brain injury: One size may not fit all [^114YbexH]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Post-cardiac arrest brain injury (PCABI) emanates from the injurious pathophysiologic sequelae that occur during and after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Regrettably, identification of efficacious management strategies to mitigate PCABI has been disappointing, with numerous well-conducted randomized controlled trials yielding neutral results. The reasons for this observation are likely multifactorial. However, increasingly, patient- and disease-specific heterogeneity is recognized as a crucial factor in clinical decision-making.

Traditionally, PCABI has been stratified based on simple historical characteristics (e.g. location of cardiac arrest, initial rhythm, witnessed vs. unwitnessed) that inadequately reflect in vivo PCABI severity or responses to clinical interventions within individual patients. It is, therefore, increasingly clear that this approach to PCABI is insufficient. In other syndromes, such as sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome, attempts to identify early "phenotypes" of patients reflect a growing recognition of considerable between-patient heterogeneity in the disease mechanisms and response to therapeutic interventions. A similar approach should be taken with PCABI.

In this review, we described the clinical heterogeneity and phenotypes of PCABI as related to the underlying pathophysiology, selective anatomical vulnerability, and electrographic patterns. The overarching aim of the review is to propose a shift to expeditious phenotyping of PCABI severity that focuses on assessing in vivo severity and patterns of injury that could be used for future clinical decision-making.

### Temperature control after cardiac arrest [^114316K5]. Resuscitation (2023). Low credibility.

Managing temperature is an important part of post-cardiac arrest care. Fever or hyperthermia during the first few days after cardiac arrest is associated with worse outcomes in many studies. Clinical data have not determined any target temperature or duration of temperature management that clearly improves patient outcomes. Guidelines and recent reviews recommend controlling temperature to prevent hyperthermia. Higher temperatures can lead to secondary brain injury by increasing seizures, brain edema, and metabolic demand. Some data suggest that targeting a temperature below normal could benefit select patients where this pathology is common.

Clinical temperature management should address the physiology of heat balance. Core temperature reflects the heat content of the head and torso, and changes in core temperature result from changes in the balance of heat production and heat loss. Clinical management of patients after cardiac arrest should include the measurement of core temperature at accurate sites and monitoring of signs of heat production, including shivering. Multiple methods can increase or decrease heat loss, including external and internal devices. Heat loss can trigger compensatory reflexes that increase stress and metabolic demand. Therefore, any active temperature management should include specific pharmacotherapy or other interventions to control thermogenesis, especially shivering. More research is required to determine whether individualized temperature management can improve outcomes.

### Updates in cardiac arrest resuscitation [^114w5rWK]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Low credibility.

There are approximately 350,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests annually in the United States, with survival rates of approximately 5% to 10% and 24%, respectively. The critical factors that impact cardiac arrest survival include prompt recognition and activation of prehospital care, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and rapid defibrillation. Advanced life support protocols are continually refined to optimize intracardiac arrest management and improve survival with a favorable neurologic outcome.

This article focuses on treatment recommendations for adult nontraumatic cardiac arrest, with emphasis on the latest evidence and controversies regarding intracardiac arrest management.

### Risk-standardizing rates of return of spontaneous circulation for in-hospital cardiac arrest to facilitate hospital comparisons [^114uCv6n]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

Sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is the most proximal and direct assessment of acute resuscitation quality in hospitals. However, validated tools to benchmark hospital rates for ROSC after in‐hospital cardiac arrest currently do not exist.

- **Methods and results**: Within the national Get With The Guidelines‐Resuscitation registry, we identified 83,206 patients admitted from 335 hospitals from 2014 to 2017 with in‐hospital cardiac arrest. Using hierarchical logistic regression, we derived and validated a model for ROSC, defined as spontaneous and sustained ROSC for ≥ 20 consecutive minutes, from 24 pre‐arrest variables and calculated rates of risk‐standardized ROSC for in‐hospital cardiac arrest for each hospital.

	- Overall, rates of ROSC were 72.0% and 72.7% for the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. The model in the derivation cohort had moderate discrimination (C‐statistic 0.643) and excellent calibration (R² of 0.996). Seventeen variables were associated with ROSC, and a parsimonious model retained 10 variables.

	- Before risk‐adjustment, the median hospital ROSC rate was 70.5% (interquartile range: 64.7–76.9%; range: 33.3–89.6%). After adjustment, the distribution of risk‐standardized ROSC rates was narrower: median of 71.9% (interquartile range: 68.2–76.4%; range: 42.2–84.6%). Overall, 56 (16.7%) of 335 hospitals had at least a 10% absolute change in percentile rank after risk standardization: 27 (8.0%) with a ≥ 10% negative percentile change and 29 (8.7%) with a ≥ 10% positive percentile change.

### Postresuscitation care after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: Clinical update and focus on targeted temperature management [^1138tpd3]. Anesthesiology (2019). Low credibility.

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. With the introduction of targeted temperature management more than a decade ago, postresuscitation care has attracted increased attention. In the present review, we discuss best practice hospital management of unconscious out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with a special focus on targeted temperature management. What is termed post-cardiac arrest syndrome strikes all organs and mandates access to specialized intensive care.

All patients need a secured airway, and most patients need hemodynamic support with fluids and/or vasopressors. Furthermore, immediate coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention, when indicated, have become essential parts of the postresuscitation treatment.

- **Targeted temperature management**: This involves controlled sedation and mechanical ventilation as the most important neuroprotective strategies. Targeted temperature management should be initiated as quickly as possible, and according to international guidelines, it should be maintained at 32° to 36°C for at least 24 hours, whereas rewarming should not increase more than 0.5°C per hour.

However, uncertainty remains regarding components such as the optimal cooling rate, target temperature, duration of cooling, and rewarming rate, warranting further research. Moreover, targeted temperature management is linked to some adverse effects. The risk of infection and bleeding is moderately increased, as is the risk of hypokalemia and magnesemia. Circulation needs to be monitored.

### Post-cardiac arrest brain injury: Pathophysiology and treatment [^112ixQNf]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death, affecting more than a million individuals worldwide every year. Despite recent advancements in the field of cardiac arrest and resuscitation, the management and prognosis of post-cardiac arrest brain injury remain suboptimal. The pathophysiology involves a complex cascade of molecular events, most of which remain unknown. Considering the potentially broad therapeutic window for neuroprotective drug therapy offered in most successfully resuscitated patients after cardiac arrest, further research is imperative. This article aims to present the major pathophysiological disturbances leading to post-cardiac arrest brain injury and review the available pharmacological therapies.

### Association between a hospital's quality performance for in-hospital cardiac arrest and common medical conditions [^115yMD2a]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2013). Low credibility.

Public reporting on hospital quality has been widely adopted for common medical conditions, and adding a measure of inpatient survival after cardiac arrest is being considered. It is unknown whether this measure would be redundant, given evidence that hospital organization and culture can have hospital-wide effects on quality. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the correlation between inpatient survival after cardiac arrest and 30-day risk-standardized mortality rates for common medical conditions.

- **Methods and results**: Using data from 2007 to 2010 from a national in-hospital cardiac arrest registry, we calculated risk-standardized in-hospital survival rates for cardiac arrest at each hospital. We obtained risk-standardized 30-day mortality rates for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia from Hospital Compare for the same period. The relationship between a hospital's performance on cardiac arrest and these other medical conditions was assessed using weighted Pearson correlation coefficients. Among 26,270 patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest at 130 hospitals, survival rates varied across hospitals, with a median risk-standardized hospital survival rate of 22.1% and an interquartile range of 19.7% to 24.2%. There were no significant correlations between a hospital's outcomes for its cardiac arrest patients and its patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction (correlation, -0.12; P = 0.16), heart failure (correlation, -0.05; P = 0.57), or pneumonia (correlation, -0.15; P = 0.10).

- **Conclusions**: Hospitals that performed better on publicly reported metrics did not show significant associations between cardiac arrest outcomes and outcomes for other conditions.

### Postcardiac arrest management [^113ZsNX3]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest affects more than 300,000 individuals annually in North America. Advances in systematic and regimented postresuscitation care have reduced mortality and improved neurologic outcomes in select cohorts of patients over the past decade. Postcardiac arrest care now represents a crucial link in the chain of survival. For most patients, high-quality postcardiac arrest care begins in the Emergency Department. This article reviews the evidence and offers treatment strategies for the key components of postcardiac arrest care.

### Critical care management of patients after cardiac arrest: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association and Neurocritical Care Society [^1172uW4N]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Although post-cardiac arrest (CA) myocardial dysfunction is common, it is not correlated with survival or neurological outcome, indicating that patients can still have a good outcome with aggressive critical care management of their cardiac disease. The critical care management of the patient with post-CA cardiac dysfunction lacks high-certainty evidence-based guidance. Here, we address important topics such as the use of echocardiography to guide hemodynamic resuscitation after CA, the emerging field of mechanical circulatory support after CA, and determination of which patients without ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction may be considered for catheterization.

- **Hemodynamics, monitoring, and mechanical circulatory support**: As discussed in the section, "Neurological management in the Intensive Care Unit: Brain oxygenation, perfusion, edema, and ICP", the optimal blood pressure target to improve CA outcomes and how to achieve said targets have been of research interest over the past decade. Recent studies have focused on the association between blood pressure and neurological function, specifically evaluating surrogates of brain perfusion and oxygenation, under the premise that using physiological data points that assess cerebral oxygen delivery and perfusion may help guide blood pressure thresholds and improve neurological outcomes. Individual patient characteristics, including the degree of myocardial dysfunction, underlying cause of shock, baseline prearrest blood pressure, and concomitant brain injury, are evaluated when post-CA mean arterial pressure (MAP) targets are set.

### Temporal trends in characteristics and outcomes associated with in-hospital cardiac arrest: A 20-year analysis (1999–2018) [^115aL2iA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

Tremendous advances in resuscitative as well as post–cardiac arrest care have been made over the past two decades, which is reflected by this analysis. The study of a nationally representative population reflects a gradual shift in in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) toward a younger albeit sicker population. This increase has been most marked in patients in the lowest quartile of median income. A clear transition in proportions of IHCA cases from larger‐sized, rural hospitals toward smaller and medium‐sized urban teaching hospitals is noted. Furthermore, we also observed an increased burden of comorbidities among patients with IHCA, which is consistent with recent data from the Get With The Guidelines registry. Interestingly, the proportion of IHCAs associated with noncardiac admissions, such as sepsis, has increased substantially, whereas cardiac disorders such as acute myocardial infarction and heart failure have gradually declined. This is perhaps a consequence of advances in medical management of acute myocardial infarction and heart failure over the past two decades.

IHCA‐related survival rates, especially in the setting of pulseless electrical activity (PEA)‐asystole, have increased significantly over the past two decades, in alignment with reports by Thompson et al. and recent data from a Swedish registry. Ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF)‐related survival has plateaued in recent years after rapid initial improvements in outcomes at the turn of the century. These survival rates correlate well with data from the Get With The Guidelines registry, prior National Inpatient Sample (NIS)‐based studies, and data from a Swedish registry, but were lower compared with the UK National data.

### Impact of therapeutic hypothermia onset and duration on survival, neurologic function, and neurodegeneration after cardiac arrest [^116ntZE8]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Post-cardiac-arrest therapeutic hypothermia improves outcomes in comatose cardiac arrest survivors. This study tests the hypothesis that the efficacy of post-cardiac-arrest therapeutic hypothermia is dependent on the onset and duration of therapy.

- **Design**: Prospective randomized laboratory investigation.

- **Setting**: University research laboratory.

- **Subjects**: A total of 268 male Long Evans rats.

- **Interventions**: Post-cardiac-arrest therapeutic hypothermia.

- **Measurements and main results**: Adult male Long Evans rats that achieved return of spontaneous circulation following a 10-minute asphyxial cardiac arrest were block randomized to normothermia (37°C ± 1°C) or therapeutic hypothermia (33°C ± 1°C). The hypothermia was initiated 0, 1, 4, or 8 hours after return of spontaneous circulation and maintained for 24 or 48 hours. Therapeutic hypothermia initiated at these times resulted in 7-day survival rates of 45%*, 36%*, 36%*, and 14%, respectively, compared to 17% for normothermic controls, with survival showing good neurologic function rates of 24%*, 24%*, 19%*, and 0%, respectively, compared to 2% for normothermic controls (✱ p < .05 vs. normothermia). These outcomes did not differ when therapeutic hypothermia was maintained for 24 vs. 48 hours. In contrast, hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuron counts were 53% ± 27%*, 53% ± 19%*, 51% ± 24%*, and 65% ± 16%* of normal when therapeutic hypothermia was initiated 0, 1, 4, or 8 hours after return of spontaneous circulation, compared to 9% in normothermic controls (✱ p < .01 vs. normothermia).
