## Question

What are the key components of the RF-CL model for estimating pre-test likelihood of obstructive CAD?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the RF-CL model for estimating pre-test likelihood of obstructive CAD, specifically its key components, performance, and how it compares with other models and guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core inputs and how RF-CL extends beyond classic PTP. Then, I should verify the model's derivation and validation methodology. Next, I will review performance metrics and reclassification. After that, I need to check guideline positioning and practical thresholds. Finally, I will compare RF-CL with alternatives and consider limitations and implementation nuances, making sure I double-check any overstatements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the foundational inputs. RF-CL builds on the traditional pre-test probability framework that uses age, sex, and symptom typicality, and then adds a simple count of cardiovascular risk factors, typically diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, and family history of premature CAD, to refine the likelihood estimate, which is exactly how it was operationalized in the derivation and validation cohorts [^112Wzq5z] [^112Wzq5z].

> Wait, let me verify the symptom classification so I don't misstate it. Typical angina is generally defined as substernal chest discomfort provoked by exertion or stress and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. Atypical angina meets two of those features. Non-anginal chest pain meets one or none, and this schema is consistent with contemporary PTP frameworks and the RF-CL implementation that preserves symptom typicality alongside age and sex before layering in risk factors [^1145u9hn] [^1124JdXK].

> I need to check the model construction details. RF-CL was derived from a large symptomatic cohort and validated internationally, with the risk factor component operationalized as a categorical count of 0–1, 2–3, or 4–5 risk factors, which are then integrated with age, sex, and symptom typicality to produce a tabulated clinical likelihood estimate that clinicians can apply at the bedside without online calculators, improving feasibility compared with more complex tools [^1124JdXK] [^117QageW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about performance without anchoring to reference standards. RF-CL consistently outperforms basic PTP models that rely on age and sex alone, with higher AUCs and better discrimination of obstructive CAD, and it substantially increases the proportion of patients categorized as very low likelihood, where guidelines allow deferral of further testing, while maintaining high negative predictive value for obstructive disease [^1124JdXK] [^114BSBmV] [^112Wzq5z].

> I should double-check the magnitude of reclassification. In multiple external validations, RF-CL moves roughly 40–50% of patients into a very low likelihood category, compared with about 5–20% with basic PTP models, and in those very low likelihood strata the observed prevalence of obstructive CAD remains under 5% with very low event rates, supporting safe deferral of testing when clinical judgment concurs [^112F9dH1] [^116pKbf4] [^111YYSTa].

> Next, I should review guideline positioning to ensure alignment. The 2024 ESC chronic coronary syndromes guideline explicitly recommends estimating pre-test likelihood using the Risk Factor–weighted Clinical Likelihood model, and it advises that patients with very low likelihood, typically defined as ≤ 5%, should have further diagnostic testing deferred, which operationalizes RF-CL into practice recommendations [^116VgJk5] [^112mcYBD].

> Let me consider how RF-CL compares with other contemporary models so I don't overstate uniqueness. Compared with the AHA/ACC sex- and age–based PTP, which often overestimates disease by a factor of about 2.6 in contemporary cohorts, RF-CL that includes symptom typicality and risk factors improves calibration and discrimination, and compared with ESC-PTP that includes age, sex, and symptoms, RF-CL further improves discrimination by adding risk factors, while CACS-CL, which layers coronary artery calcium onto RF-CL, achieves even stronger discrimination and reclassification, albeit at the cost of an additional test [^114BSBmV] [^114txTv5] [^1124JdXK].

> But wait, what if the population or reference standard differs? I should confirm calibration nuances. RF-CL and CACS-CL were derived and validated against invasive angiography, so they may appear to underestimate disease when validated against coronary CTA, which tends to overcall stenosis severity relative to ICA; conversely, they calibrate better against revascularization endpoints, which is clinically meaningful for triage decisions, so clinicians should interpret likelihood estimates in the context of the chosen reference standard and downstream testing strategy [^117NLqJb] [^114KzH8p].

> I need to ensure I address practical implementation. RF-CL is designed as a simple, tabulated tool that can be used at the point of care without online calculators, and its performance is robust across diverse cohorts, though clinicians should still integrate additional clinical data such as resting ECG, echocardiography, or peripheral vascular findings when available to refine the estimate, as suggested by contemporary ESC guidance on adjusting clinical likelihood [^1124JdXK] [^115bz9Hj].

> Hold on, I should verify limitations and where CACS adds value. RF-CL does not incorporate coronary calcium, so in patients with low but not very low likelihood, adding CACS can further down-classify a substantial fraction to very low likelihood with a low number needed to test, and CACS-CL consistently shows the highest discrimination among simple clinical models, though CACS should be interpreted as a marker of atherosclerotic burden rather than a diagnostic test for ischemia [^115a5VwY] [^1124JdXK].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. RF-CL enhances the classic PTP approach by integrating a simple risk factor count with age, sex, and symptom typicality, yielding more accurate, better calibrated estimates of obstructive CAD likelihood, safely identifying a larger proportion of patients in whom further testing can be deferred, and aligning with current ESC guidance that endorses RF-CL for pre-test likelihood estimation in chronic coronary syndromes [^1124JdXK] [^116VgJk5] [^112mcYBD].

---

The RF-CL model estimates pre-test likelihood of obstructive CAD using **age, sex, symptom typicality, and cardiovascular risk factors** (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and family history) [^1124JdXK]. It improves discrimination over basic PTP models by incorporating risk factors, and is **endorsed by the 2024 ESC guidelines** for pre-test likelihood assessment in chronic coronary syndromes [^116VgJk5]. The model categorizes patients into very low (≤ 5%), low (6–15%), moderate (16–50%), and high (> 50%) likelihood, guiding test selection and the need for further diagnostic workup [^115a5VwY].

---

## Core components of the RF-CL model

The RF-CL model integrates **four core components** to estimate the pre-test likelihood of obstructive CAD:

| **Component** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Age | Patient age significantly influences the likelihood of obstructive CAD, with older patients having higher pre-test probabilities [^1145u9hn]. |
| Sex | Male sex is associated with a higher likelihood of obstructive CAD compared to female sex [^1145u9hn]. |
| Symptom typicality | The model considers the typicality of chest pain symptoms, distinguishing between typical angina, atypical angina, and non-anginal chest pain [^1145u9hn]. |
| Cardiovascular risk factors | The model incorporates the presence of cardiovascular risk factors, including diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and family history of premature CAD [^notfound]. |

---

## Clinical application and validation

The RF-CL model has been extensively validated in large cohorts, demonstrating **superior discrimination and calibration** compared to traditional pre-test probability models [^1124JdXK]. It effectively stratifies patients into risk categories, enabling clinicians to make informed decisions regarding further diagnostic testing and management strategies [^112Wzq5z].

---

## Clinical implications and guidelines

The RF-CL model has been **incorporated into the 2024 ESC guidelines** for the management of chronic coronary syndromes, specifically recommending its use for estimating pre-test likelihood of obstructive CAD [^116VgJk5]. The guidelines emphasize the importance of integrating clinical risk factors into pre-test probability assessments to optimize diagnostic strategies and reduce unnecessary testing [^115bz9Hj].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While the RF-CL model significantly improves pre-test probability estimation, certain limitations should be considered:

- **Population specificity**: The model was primarily validated in Western populations, and its applicability to diverse ethnic groups may vary [^113ysw4W].
- **Risk factor quantification**: The model considers the presence or absence of risk factors but does not account for the severity or duration of these factors [^117XnyWU].
- **Clinical judgment**: The model should be used in conjunction with clinical judgment and patient-specific factors to guide diagnostic decision-making [^115bz9Hj].

---

The RF-CL model is a **validated tool** that incorporates age, sex, symptom typicality, and cardiovascular risk factors to estimate the pre-test likelihood of obstructive CAD. It is endorsed by the 2024 ESC guidelines and provides a more accurate and clinically useful assessment compared to traditional models, thereby optimizing diagnostic strategies and patient management [^116VgJk5].

Introduction

In clinical routine, coronary artery disease (CAD) can be diagnosed by using invasive and non-invasive diagnostic tests. Choosing the appropriate and most beneficial diagnostic test for each patient is highly important, since invasive and non-invasive tests have different advantages and disadvantages. Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) enables invasive therapeutic measures in the same session, but is associated with a small risk of procedural complications. These risks can be avoided in clinical practice by using non-invasive tests instead. Coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography is a safe non-invasive diagnostic test with a very high negative predictive value, making it especially valuable for ruling out obstructive CAD. The calculation of pre-test probability (PTP) of disease can facilitate selecting patients with stable angina pectoris for the most beneficial diagnostic procedure. The current European Guidelines recommend the selection of the appropriate diagnostic test according to the individual patient's CAD probability. Thus, the correct assessment of the likelihood of CAD is important to select patients for the diagnostic procedure with the highest expected clinical benefit. Multiple PTP calculators exist and have been established in clinical practice. The Diamond-Forrester (D+F) PTP calculation model, which is recommended by the current European guidelines for patients with stable chest pain, was introduced as early as 1979 (initial D+F) and is based on three clinical parameters that have to be assessed in patients (the patient's age, the type of angina presentation, and the patient's gender). Studies have shown that the original D+F model overestimated the prevalence of CAD. The original D+F was statistically updated by Genders et al in 2011 to improve the prediction of obstructive CAD especially in women and patients with atypical angina presentation (updated D+F 2011) being clinically referred to ICA. The purpose of this study was to analyse the accuracy of PTP calculation of CAD using the original and updated D+F prediction models in patients with stable chest pain with a clinical referral for either CT or ICA in a multi-centre pan-European setting.

### More accurate prediction of the pretest probability… [^112yYTK1]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Synopsis Current guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend the use of the familiar Diamond-Forrester classification system to determine the pretest likelihood of CAD. It uses age, sex, and the type of angina to place patients into risk groups for angina. In this study, the authors identified 2, 274 patients without known cardiovascular disease who were referred for coronary computed tomographic angiography. Based on the U. S. guidelines, patients with a probability of less than 5% are classified as low risk and do not need further testing, those with a probability of 5% to 70% should undergo noninvasive testing, and those with a probability greater than 70% should undergo invasive angiography. The cutoffs in the European guidelines are 15% and 85%, consistent with a less-aggressive approach to evaluation.

The key finding was how poorly the Diamond-Forrester model fit the contemporary data. A calibration plot graphs the observed probability of CAD against the predicted probability. Although calibration was good for the European scores, the Diamond-Forrester score greatly overestimated the likelihood of CAD. For example, at a predicted probability of 50%, the actual probability was only approximately 30%. The Diamond-Forrester score classified only 8% of patients as low risk, compared with 25% with the basic European score and 30% with the enhanced European score. Conversely, the Diamond-Forrester system was far more likely to classify a patient as high risk and requiring invasive angiography: 18% vs. 1% for both of the European scores.

Strengths and limitations

This multi-centre study included patients from clinical sites across Europe. Our patient population is very robust, including patients from 25 different clinical sites, with a high overall patient number of more than 1000 patients, and an almost similar male-to-female ratio in both the CT and ICA group. This pilot study was planned to prepare the subsequent randomised controlled trial. Therefore, patients were routinely sent for CT and ICA examinations per clinical indication. However, this study was not designed as a controlled randomised trial.

In this study, we used both CT and ICA examination as the diagnostic gold standard. This is due to the fact that various clinical studies have proven the high diagnostic accuracy of coronary CT angiography and its high negative predictive value. In our study population, the clinical presentation significantly differed between the CT and ICA group. Due to the design of the D+F model, patient gender and age are part of the PTP calculation and these differences do not reduce the validity of our patient collective, but reflect routine clinical decision-making. In this study, we did not acquire detailed information on the patients' medical histories (e.g. diabetes, arterial hypertension, smoking status, family history of CAD), CT/ICA indicators of CAD (e.g. coronary calcium score, left ventricular function, myocardial perfusion, wall motion), or adverse events in the follow-up. Thus, we were not able to perform a more detailed analysis to assess the differences in the prevalence of obstructive CAD; we observed between the different clinical sites or using other tests for estimation of pre-test probability (e.g. SCORE or the extended D+F model). As the current European guidelines recommend the D+F model statistically updated by Genders et al in order to select patients for further diagnostic tests, we decided to request only clinical data for the fast and intuitive initial and updated D+F estimation model.

Both the AUCs of the D+F models and the prevalence of significant CAD, which reflects post-test probability, varied strongly among the European sites participating in the study.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to coronary CTA, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain coronary CTA to diagnose obstructive CAD and to estimate the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with suspected chronic coronary syndrome and low or moderate (> 5–50%) pre-test likelihood of obstructive CAD.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Low-risk patients with stable chest pain and no known CAD — recommendations: For patients with stable chest pain and no known CAD presenting to the outpatient clinic, a model to estimate pretest probability of obstructive CAD is effective to identify patients at low risk for obstructive CAD and favorable prognosis in whom additional diagnostic testing can be deferred (Class 1, Level B-NR). For patients with stable chest pain and no known CAD categorized as low risk, CAC testing is reasonable as a first-line test for excluding calcified plaque and identifying patients with a low likelihood of obstructive CAD (Class 2a, Level B-R). For patients with stable chest pain and no known CAD categorized as low risk, exercise testing without imaging is reasonable as a first-line test for excluding myocardial ischemia and determining functional capacity in patients with an interpretable ECG (Class 2a, Level B-NR).

Stable chest pain with no known coronary artery disease (CAD) — pretest risk probability usage: in symptomatic patients with suspected CAD, use of validated scores to predict the pretest probability of obstructive CAD may be useful to identify low-risk patients for whom testing may be deferred. It is preferable to use contemporary estimates such as those published in the past 10 years; alternatively, low-risk patients may be those < 40 years of age or who have symptoms with a low likelihood of representing ischemia. When available, information on the presence and amount of coronary artery calcium (CAC) may be useful for enhancing the pretest probability of obstructive CAD.

### Cost-effectiveness in diagnosis of stable angina patients: a decision-analytical modelling approach [^111qRXnq]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity analysis

Parametric uncertainty was captured with a probabilistic sensitivity analysis using 1000-iteration Monte Carlo simulation. In this approach, appropriate distributions were assigned to each parameter to reflect the underlying uncertainty in that parameter (online supplemental table A2), for example, with the confidence intervals for the diagnostic accuracies, costs of tests and complications costs. A value was then sampled from the specified distribution for each parameter and the model evaluated for that specific parameter set in each Monte Carlo simulation. The results of the simulation are reported using cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEAC). The latter report the likelihood that each strategy is the most cost-effective strategy according to the value placed on the outcome - a correct diagnosis. ICERs were calculated after determining mean costs and mean outcomes for each strategy from the probabilistic analysis.

In scenario analysis, we considered patient subgroups with pre-test probability of CAD between 15% and 85% with 10% increments according to recent ESC guidelines. We defined optimal diagnostic strategies as those yielding the maximum net monetary benefit (most cost-effective) at CET values ranging from £2000 to £50 000 per correct diagnosis. We report the best strategy across the range of pre-test probabilities at each CET along with the expected costs, proportion of correct diagnoses and incidence of complication and death.

### External validation of novel clinical likelihood models to predict obstructive coronary artery disease and prognosis [^1117jkEm]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Calibration of the ESC-PTP, RF-CL and CACS-CL models against revascularisation within 120 days following coronary CTA is shown in figure 2A. Overall, all models overestimated the probability of revascularisation, with the RF-CL model showing the smallest degree of revascularisation probability overestimation. In general, all models showed increasing probability overestimation with increasing CL.

### External validation of novel clinical likelihood models to predict obstructive coronary artery disease and prognosis [^1129H9HT]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Our cohort consisted exclusively of Caucasian patients, and results should be extrapolated carefully. All patients had chest pain but dyspnoea was not recorded in SCOT-HEART and CL estimates are solely based on chest pain typicality. Our cohort underwent coronary CTA which improves prognosis by early initiation of guideline-directed medical therapy and this could impact subsequent cardiac outcomes.

### External validation of novel clinical likelihood models to predict obstructive coronary artery disease and prognosis [^117XnyWU]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Calculation of CL models

The ECT-PTP model was calculated from sex, age and type of chest pain as recommended in the 2019 ESC guidelines on chronic coronary syndrome. The RF-CL was additionally calculated from the number of risk factors ranging from 0 to 5 (see above), and the CACS-CL incorporated CACS to the RF-CL model.

All models were divided into groups of very-low (≤ 5%), low (> 5%–15%) and moderate-high (> 15%) likelihood of obstructive CAD.

Reference standards and clinical endpoint

Obstructive CAD was defined as > 70% diameter stenosis in a major epicardial vessel on CTA as previously reported. Second, revascularisation within 120 days after coronary CTA was used as reference standard.

The clinical endpoint was non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death at 5 years.

Statistical analyses

Variables are expressed as mean ± SD or median (range), categorical variables reported as frequencies (percentages). The RF-CL and CACS-CL models were compared with the ESC-PTP model.

Discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), and AUCs were compared using the DeLong algorithm. Additionally, diagnostic performance was evaluated by sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (NPV) using a ≤ 5% CL cut-off. Comparison of sensitivities and specificities was tested using McNemar's test and a weighted generalised score statistics for comparison of predictive values of diagnostic tests.

For time-to-event analyses, Cox-regression assumptions were met and HRs were calculated. The cumulative incidence of the primary outcome, non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death, was estimated using the Aalen-Johansen method with non-cardiovascular death as competing risk, while the Kaplan-Meier method was used for non-fatal myocardial infarction and all-cause death.

### Evaluating the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology guideline-recommended and contemporary pretest probability models in a mixed Asian cohort: the contribution of coronary artery calcium [^113ysw4W]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Most pretest probability (PTP) tools for obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) were Western -developed. The most appropriate PTP models and the contribution of coronary artery calcium score (CACS) in Asian populations remain unknown. In a mixed Asian cohort, we compare 5 PTP models: local assessment of the heart (LAH), CAD Consortium (CAD2), risk factor-weighted clinical likelihood, the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology and the European Society of Cardiology PTP and 3 extended versions of these models that incorporated CACS: LAH (CACS), CAD2 (CACS), and the CACS-clinical likelihood.

Methods and Results

The study cohort included 771 patients referred for stable chest pain. Obstructive CAD prevalence was 27.5%. Calibration, area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC) and net reclassification index were evaluated. LAH clinical had the best calibration (χ 2 5.8; P = 0.12). For CACS models, LAH (CACS) showed least deviation between observed and expected cases (χ 2 37.5; P < 0.001). There was no difference in AUCs between the LAH clinical (AUC, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.69–0.77]), CAD2 clinical (AUC, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.68–0.76]), risk factor-weighted clinical likelihood (AUC, 0.73 [95% CI: 0.69–0.76) and European Society of Cardiology PTP (AUC, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.67–0.75]). CACS improved discrimination and reclassification of the LAH (CACS) (AUC, 0.88; net reclassification index, 0.46), CAD2 (CACS) (AUC, 0.87; net reclassification index, 0.29) and CACS-CL (AUC, 0.87; net reclassification index, 0.25).

Conclusions

In a mixed Asian cohort, Asian-derived LAH models had similar discriminatory performance but better calibration and risk categorization for clinically relevant PTP cutoffs. Incorporating CACS improved discrimination and reclassification. These results support the use of population-matched, CACS-inclusive PTP tools for the prediction of obstructive CAD.

### Clinical risk prediction, coronary computed tomography angiography, and cardiovascular events in new-onset chest pain: the PROMISE and SCOT-HEART trials [^1114PxSU]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Whether index testing using coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) improves outcomes in stable chest pain is debated. The risk factor weighted clinical likelihood (RF-CL) model provides likelihood estimation of obstructive coronary artery disease. This study investigated the prognostic effect of coronary CTA vs. usual care by RF-CL estimates.

Methods

Large-scale studies randomized patients (N = 13 748) with stable chest pain to coronary CTA as part of the initial work-up in addition to or instead of usual care including functional testing. Patients were stratified according to RF-CL estimates [RF-CL: very-low (≤ 5%), low (> 5%-15%), and moderate/high (> 15%)]. The primary endpoint was myocardial infarction or death at 3 years.

Results

The primary endpoint occurred in 313 (2.3%) patients. Event rates were similar in patients allocated to coronary CTA vs. usual care [risk difference (RD) 0.3%, hazard ratio (HR) 0.84 (95% CI 0.67–1.05)]. Overall, 33%, 44%, and 23% patients had very-low, low, and moderate/high RF-CL. Risk was similar in patients with very low and moderate/high RF-CL allocated to coronary CTA vs. usual care [very low: RD 0.3%, HR 1.27 (0.74–2.16); moderate/high: RD 0.5%, HR 0.88 (0.63–1.23)]. Conversely, patients with low RF-CL undergoing coronary CTA had lower event rates [RD 0.7%, HR 0.67 (95% CI 0.47–0.97)]. The number needed to test using coronary CTA to prevent one event within 3 years was 143.

Conclusions

Despite an overall good prognosis, low RF-CL patients have reduced risk of myocardial infarction or death when allocated to coronary CTA vs. usual care. Risk is similar in patients with very-low and moderate/high likelihood.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to risk assessment (obstructive CAD), ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining exercise ECG and detecting atherosclerotic disease in non-coronary arteries to adjust the pre-test likelihood estimate in patients with an initially low (> -15%) likelihood of obstructive CAD.

Bayesian analysis

Interval likelihood ratios were calculated for each CACS category (Supplementary Table A2). CACS 0 had very low values of 0.11 for abnormal perfusion and 0.04 for severe ischemia, while CACS ≥ 2500 had very high values of 23.7 for abnormal perfusion and 14.4 for severe ischemia. Using Bayes' formula, we calculated post-test probabilities of abnormal perfusion and severe ischemia for any pre-test probability (Figure 3). The lowest and highest CACS categories had a strong impact on post-test probabilities. For example, CACS 0 reduced the post-test probability of severe ischemia to ≤ 5% for the complete range of pre-test probabilities from guidelines (0–52%). Then, we calculated post-test probabilities combining pre-test-AHA/ACC or pre-test-ESC with CACS in our participants (post-test-AHA/ACC, post-test-ESC, Figure 4). The prevalence of abnormal perfusion and severe ischemia increased steeply across post-test probability categories, up to 86% abnormal perfusion with post-test-ESC > 85% (rule-in level). In ROC analysis, AUC were slightly, but significantly higher with post-test-ESC than post-test-AHA/ACC (both P ≤ 0.04, Figure 4). In threshold analysis, post-test-AHA/ACC ≤ 5% had a higher sensitivity, but post-test-ESC ≤ 5% categorized more participants as low probability of CAD (Table 3, Supplementary Figure A2). For abnormal perfusion, 23% of participants had post-test-AHA/ACC ≤ 5%, with sensitivity 97% (96–99%) and NPV 98% (96–99%), while 33% had post-test-ESC ≤ 5%, with sensitivity 94% (92–96%) and NPV 96% (95–97%). For severe ischemia, 30% of participants had post-test-AHA/ACC ≤ 5%, with sensitivity 98% (95–99%) and NPV 99% (98–100%), while 37% had post-test-ESC ≤ 5%, with sensitivity 96% (92–98%) and NPV 99% (98–99%). The analysis of participant flows through categories of probabilities and CACS highlighted the higher proportion of participants classified as low probability of CAD with ESC probabilities compared with AHA/ACC probabilities (all P < 0.001), and the very low proportion participants with PET findings classified as low probability (Figure 5).

### Prediction model to estimate presence of coronary artery disease: retrospective pooled analysis of existing cohorts [^117J3ADJ]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Definitions

We collected data for age, sex, symptoms, cardiovascular risk factors, test results, and presence of coronary artery disease. Chest pain symptoms were classified as typical, atypical, or non-specific. Typical chest pain was defined as all of the following criteria: (1) substernal chest pain or discomfort that is (2) provoked by exertion or emotional stress and (3) relieved by rest or nitroglycerine (or both). We defined atypical chest pain as two of these criteria. If one or none of the criteria was present, symptoms were classified as non-specific.

Definitions for hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, and smoking differed slightly across hospitals (web appendix table 1). Table 1lists the most common definitions. We determined coronary calcium scores by the Agatston methodand used log transformation to account for its skewed distribution.

### Clinical pre-test probability for obstructive coronary artery disease: insights from the European DISCHARGE pilot study [^115BabAf]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To test the accuracy of clinical pre-test probability (PTP) for prediction of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in a pan-European setting.

Methods

Patients with suspected CAD and stable chest pain who were clinically referred for invasive coronary angiography (ICA) or computed tomography (CT) were included by clinical sites participating in the pilot study of the European multi-centre DISCHARGE trial. PTP of CAD was determined using the Diamond-Forrester (D+F) prediction model initially introduced in 1979 and the updated D+F model from 2011. Obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) was defined by one at least 50% diameter coronary stenosis by both CT and ICA.

Results

In total, 1440 patients (654 female, 786 male) were included at 25 clinical sites from May 2014 until July 2017. Of these patients, 725 underwent CT, while 715 underwent ICA. Both prediction models overestimated the prevalence of obstructive CAD (31.7%, 456 of 1440 patients, PTP: initial D+F 58.9% (28.1–90.6%), updated D+F 47.3% (34.2–59.9%), both p < 0.001), but overestimation of disease prevalence was higher for the initial D+F (p < 0.001). The discriminative ability was higher for the updated D+F 2011 (AUC of 0.73 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70–0.76 versus AUC of 0.70 CI 0.67–0.73 for the initial D+F; p < 0.001; odds ratio (or) 1.55 CI 1.29–1.86, net reclassification index 0.11 CI 0.05–0.16, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Clinical PTP calculation using the initial and updated D+F prediction models relevantly overestimates the actual prevalence of obstructive CAD in patients with stable chest pain clinically referred for ICA and CT suggesting that further refinements to improve clinical decision-making are needed.

Trial Registration

https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02400229 KEY POINTS:
- Clinical pre-test probability calculation using the initial and updated D+F model overestimates the prevalence of obstructive CAD identified by ICA and CT.
- Overestimation of disease prevalence is higher for the initial D+F compared with the updated D+F.
- Diagnostic accuracy of PTP assessment varies strongly between different clinical sites throughout Europe.

### Simplified approach to predicting obstructive coronary disease with integration of coronary calcium: development and external validation [^111juYFg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

To further assess the utility of our model, we compared it with other recent algorithms. One of the most comparable approaches to our current study is the updated Diamond‐Forrester model, which integrates age, sex, and chest pain to derive pretest probabilities, but with updated predictions to perform better in contemporary populations. Our model, which incorporates CAC, showed substantially higher prediction performance in training and external testing populations. In our study, model performance was not meaningfully improved by considering risk factors, making it possible to determine probability of obstructive CAD without the interim step of calculating clinical pretest probability. Increasingly complex models have also been proposed by the CAD Consortium. The models can incorporate age, sex, medical history, and CAC information, with calculation of pretest probability using dedicated online calculators to combine the contributions from each feature. Although incorporating more information into prediction models tends to improve the accuracy of predictions, each additional variable adds to the complexity and time required for calculations. More important, even if these calculations were automated, the inclusion of more features increases the probability that some data will be missing. Our previous work showed that removing variables is one of the most effective ways for dealing with missing values, further supporting a role for simplified prediction tools. It may be possible to fully integrate multiple prediction models (to account for missing values), but the data infrastructure to support these types of tools is not routinely available in most electronic medical records. This is particularly true for community practices, where many of the initial decisions about testing take place. Last, we have previously demonstrated that with machine learning models for major adverse cardiovascular event prediction, it is possible to maintain prediction performance while reducing the number of variables by > 75%, by focusing on inclusion of the most important predictors. In this case, CAC is the most important predictor in both the proposed likelihood tables and the CAD Consortium model. The practical difference between our model and the CAD Consortium model is the relative simplicity of the likelihood tables and their easy implementation, requiring simply the 4 variables of age, sex, cardiac chest pain, and CAC score.

### Prediction model to estimate presence of coronary artery disease: retrospective pooled analysis of existing cohorts [^115SmhkQ]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

In the United States, about 10.2 million people have chest pain complaints each year, and more than 1.1 million diagnostic procedures of catheter based coronary angiography are performed on inpatients each year. In a recent report based on the national cardiovascular data registry of the American College of Cardiology, only 41% of patients undergoing elective procedures of catheter based coronary angiographies are diagnosed with obstructive coronary artery disease. The report's authors concluded that better risk stratification was needed, underlined by decision analyses showing that the choice of further diagnostic investigation in patients with chest pain depends primarily on the pretest probability of coronary artery disease.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, European Society of Cardiology, and United Kingdomcurrently recommend using the Diamond and Forrester modelor the Duke clinical scoreto estimate the pretest probability of coronary artery disease in patients with chest pain. The Diamond and Forrester model tends to overestimate the probability of coronary artery disease (defined as ≥ 50% stenosis), and a revised version has recently been published. The Duke clinical scoreestimates the probability of coronary artery disease (≥ 75% stenosis) which, to our knowledge, has not been validated in populations outside the US. Although the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology recommend exercise electrocardiography to select patients for further diagnostic investigation, UK guidelines recommend using the computed tomography (CT) based coronary calcium score in patients with a low to intermediate pretest probability (10–29%).

We perceived a need for an updated and stepwise approach to estimate the probability of coronary artery disease in patients with new onset of chest pain in a low prevalence population as clinical information and test results become available, in particular because implementation of the guidelines needs calculation of the pretest probability. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the probability of obstructive coronary artery disease on the basis of clinical presentation and cardiovascular risk factors, and to determine the incremental diagnostic value of exercise electrocardiography and the coronary calcium score.

### Coronary calcium scoring improves risk prediction in patients with suspected obstructive coronary artery disease [^114XotQK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with suspected obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), the risk factor-weighted clinical likelihood (RF-CL) model and the coronary artery calcium score-weighted clinical likelihood (CACS-CL) model improves the identification of obstructive CAD compared with basic pretest probability (PTP) models.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of the new models.

Methods

The incidences of myocardial infarction and death were stratified according to categories by the RF-CL and CACS-CL and compared with categories by the PTP model. We used cohorts from a Danish register (n = 41,177) and a North American randomized study (n = 3,952). All patients were symptomatic and were referred for diagnostic testing because of clinical indications.

Results

Despite substantial down-reclassification of patients to a likelihood ≤ 5% of CAD with either the RF-CL (45%) or CACS-CL (60%) models compared with the PTP (18%), the annualized event rates of myocardial infarction and death were low using all 3 models; RF-CL 0.51% (95% CI: 0.46–0.56), CACS-CL 0.48% (95% CI: 0.44–0.56), and PTP 0.37% (95% CI: 0.31–0.44), respectively. Overall, comparison of the predictive power of the 3 models using Harrell's C-statistics demonstrated superiority of the RF-CL (0.64 [95% CI: 0.63–0.65]) and CACS-CL (0.69 [95% CI: 0.67–0.70]) compared with the PTP model (0.61 [95% CI: 0.60–0.62]).

Conclusions

The simple clinical likelihood models that include classical risk factors or risk factors combined with CACS provide improved risk stratification for myocardial infarction and death compared with the standard PTP model. Hence, the optimized RF-CL and CACS-CL models identify 2.5 and 3.3 times more patients, respectively, who may not benefit from further diagnostic testing.

### Clinical pre-test probability for obstructive coronary artery disease: insights from the European DISCHARGE pilot study [^112FTNr5]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Comparison with other studies

This study includes a large-scale prospective European cohort with both CTA and ICA being the combined gold standard in a non-specified patient cohort. Recent scientific data on the clinical application of PTP calculation in patients with suspected CAD are rare.

There are only few other papers that have assessed the accuracy of the D+F model to patients referred for CTA. They all have in common to include only patients with low PTP being clinically assigned to CT but do not compare with patients clinically referred to ICA. A study of Wasfy et al was in an American cohort including patients being referred only for CTA based on a low PTP. A more recent study evaluated 3 scores among patients with suspected CAD in the CTA randomised arm of the SCOT-HEART study for the outcome of obstructive CAD by coronary CTA: the modified D+F, CAD Consortium clinical score (CAD2), and CONFIRM risk score (CRS). They found that the best calibrator of obstructive CAD was the updated D+F, which goes in line with the results of our study. Another study has shown PTP calculation according to D+F to overestimate PTP of CAD in a multi-centre study setting with patients being also only referred to CT not ICA. This was shown in our study as well. However, in our patient collective, patients were referred to both, CTA and ICA, based on clinical estimation. The study population of Cheng et al was also characterised by a relatively low prevalence of disease of 15%. The recently published study of Foldyna et al showed overestimation of the D+F model in a large multi-centric cohort from the PROMISE trial. This is in accordance with the results of our study. Again, in comparison with our study, the study of Foldyna et al only included patients being randomised to CTA.

Thus, the analysis of our European DISCHARGE cohort provides a unique opportunity to make comparisons between pre-test models for patients referred for both CTA and ICA in 25 European sites providing performance analysis for both models in a non-selective pragmatic cohort.

### Prediction model to estimate presence of coronary artery disease: retrospective pooled analysis of existing cohorts [^113mkJ9h]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Development of new prediction models

We defined three prediction models: a basic model including age, sex, symptoms, and setting; a clinical model including age, sex, symptoms, setting, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoking, and body mass index; and an extended model including all clinical variables and the coronary calcium score. Since all clinical variables are known to be associated with coronary artery disease, all predictors were entered simultaneously in a multivariable, random effects, logistic regression model. We included hospital as a random effect to account for clustering of patients within hospitals. Availability of data for exercise electrocardiography was limited, and web appendix table 5 explores the variable's incremental predictive value. We omitted non-significant predictors with small effects (that is, odds ratio < 1.01).

### Prediction model to estimate presence of coronary artery disease: retrospective pooled analysis of existing cohorts [^114xsu1a]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objectives To develop prediction models that better estimate the pretest probability of coronary artery disease in low prevalence populations.

Design Retrospective pooled analysis of individual patient data.

Setting 18 hospitals in Europe and the United States.

Participants Patients with stable chest pain without evidence for previous coronary artery disease, if they were referred for computed tomography (CT) based coronary angiography or catheter based coronary angiography (indicated as low and high prevalence settings, respectively).

Main outcome measures Obstructive coronary artery disease (≥ 50% diameter stenosis in at least one vessel found on catheter based coronary angiography). Multiple imputation accounted for missing predictors and outcomes, exploiting strong correlation between the two angiography procedures. Predictive models included a basic model (age, sex, symptoms, and setting), clinical model (basic model factors and diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and smoking), and extended model (clinical model factors and use of the CT based coronary calcium score). We assessed discrimination (c statistic), calibration, and continuous net reclassification improvement by cross validation for the four largest low prevalence datasets separately and the smaller remaining low prevalence datasets combined.

Results We included 5677 patients (3283 men, 2394 women), of whom 1634 had obstructive coronary artery disease found on catheter based coronary angiography. All potential predictors were significantly associated with the presence of disease in univariable and multivariable analyses. The clinical model improved the prediction, compared with the basic model (cross validated c statistic improvement from 0.77 to 0.79, net reclassification improvement 35%); the coronary calcium score in the extended model was a major predictor (0.79 to 0.88, 102%). Calibration for low prevalence datasets was satisfactory.

Conclusions Updated prediction models including age, sex, symptoms, and cardiovascular risk factors allow for accurate estimation of the pretest probability of coronary artery disease in low prevalence populations. Addition of coronary calcium scores to the prediction models improves the estimates.

### Clinical pre-test probability for obstructive coronary artery disease: insights from the European DISCHARGE pilot study [^116wNjqm]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that the initial and updated D+F models relevantly overestimate the PTP of CAD compared with its actual prevalence in patients routinely selected for both CT and ICA. The updated D+F model was slightly more accurate than the initial D+F version. The prevalence of obstructive CAD differs between clinical sites in Europe. Thus, in order to choose the most beneficial diagnostic test for patients as recommended by the European guidelines, the overestimation of the actual prevalence of CAD and differences in prevalence among European countries need to be considered. More accurate clinical prediction tools are needed to optimize clinical decision-making for the diagnostic management of patients with suspected CAD.

This was followed by the CAD2 clinical and ESC‐PTP with sensitivities of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89–0.96) and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89–0.96) respectively, and last was RF‐CL, with a sensitivity of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.72–0.83) (P < 0.05 for all). The negative predictive values for LAH (0.94 [95% CI, 0.82–0.99]) and CAD 2 clinical (0.92 [95% CI, 0.87–0.95]) models were higher than RF‐CL (0.86 [95% CI, 0.82–0.90]; P < 0.05). The reverse trend was observed for specificity and positive predictive value. Otherwise, there was no significant difference between the non‐CACS models. Similar patterns were observed for the CACS models. In all cases, the incorporation of CACS improved the specificity and positive predictive value (P < 0.001 for all).

### All models are right but some are more Useful [^115TL1fa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

In the past decades, efforts have been made to establish accurate models for the assessment of probability of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), according to different patients' parameters such as age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, and symptoms. Increasing evidence supports a pretest probability (PTP)‐guided application of diagnostic testing. This may on the one hand improve diagnostic utility, deferring unnecessary testing, and reducing health costs; on the other hand, however, it may lead to underdiagnosed patients without appropriate workup and management.

Various suggested models emphasize the importance of collaboration of multiple variables for better stratification of patients with suspected obstructive CAD according to their observed prevalence of disease in contemporary cohorts. A high‐quality prediction model is one able to deliver patient‐tailored medicine, by estimating individual probabilities of illness, demonstrating correlation between predicted values that are consistent with the observed prevalence of the disease, and therefore refines the risk patients of assumed to be in the intermediate category where management is less evidence‐based.

In the current issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Winther et al used the Western Denmark Heart Registry, to examine the accuracy of various PTP models. The authors successfully calculated and compared values of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology‐PTP (AHA/ACC‐PTP) based on sex and agewith the 2019 European Society of Cardiology guideline PTP values based on sex, age, and symptomsconstructed on the updated Diamond–Forrester score, as well as the risk factor–weighted clinical likelihood values based on sex, age, symptoms, and risk factors. The AHA/ACC‐PTP maximum values overestimated by a factor of 2.6 the actual prevalence of CAD. Compared with the AHA/ACC‐PTP model (AUC, 71.5 [70.7–72.2]), inclusion of typicality of symptoms in the European Society of Cardiology‐PTP improved discrimination of CAD (AUC, 75.5 [74.7–76.3]). Inclusion of both symptoms and risk factors in the risk factor–weighted clinical likelihood further improved discrimination (AUC, 77.7 [77.0–78.5]).

### Pre-test characteristics of unstable angina patients with obstructive coronary artery disease confirmed by coronary angiography [^114oKiFH]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Patients referred for acute coronary angiography (CAG) with unstable angina (UA) have low mortality and low rate of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Better pre-test selection criteria are warranted. We aimed to assess the current guidelines against other clinical variables as predictors of obstructive CAD in patients with UA referred for acute CAG.

Methods

From 2005 to 2012, all CAGs performed at the University Hospital of North Norway, the sole provider of CAG in the region, were recorded in a registry. We included 979 admissions of UA and retrospectively collected data regarding presenting clinical parameters from patient hospital records. Obstructive CAD was defined as ≥ 50% stenosis and considered prognostically significant if found in the left main stem, proximal LAD or all three main coronary arteries. Characteristics were analysed by logistic regression analysis. A score was developed using ORs from significant factors in a multivariable model.

Results

The overall rate of obstructive CAD was 45%, and the rate of prognostically significant CAD was 11%. The risk criteria recommended in American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology guidelines had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.58. Adding clinical information increased the AUC to 0.77 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.80). Applying the derived score, we found that 56% (n = 546) of patients had a score of < 13, which was associated with a negative predictive value of 95% for prognostic significant CAD.

Conclusions

The current results suggest that CAG may be postponed or cancelled in more than half of patients with UA by improving pre-test selection criteria with the addition of clinical parameters to current guidelines.

### Evaluating the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology guideline-recommended and contemporary pretest probability models in a mixed Asian cohort: the contribution of coronary artery calcium [^113PtNk1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Angina symptoms are common, with a lifetime prevalence up to 40%, resulting in millions of individuals undergoing evaluation for obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) each year. Pretest probability (PTP) assessment is part of the evaluation strategy and is guideline recommended.

Various versions of the updated Diamond‐Forrester PTP tool, which included sex, age, and symptoms, have been used in the prediction of obstructive CAD. Other models incorporating risk factors have shown increased discrimination and reclassification of patients, including the CAD Consortium 2 (CAD2) model. Recently, tools such as the risk factor‐weighted clinical likelihood model (RF‐CL) have been shown to appropriately recategorize very low (≤ 5%) clinical likelihood patients, which would potentially avoid unnecessary testing. The 2021 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC)/American Society of Echocardiography/American College of Chest Physicians/Society for Academic Emergency Medicine/Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography/Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Guideline for the Evaluation and Diagnosis of Chest Pain includes a sex‐ and age‐stratified PTP (AHA/ACC‐PTP). This is an amalgamated version of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guideline PTP tool (ESC‐PTP), itself developed using European and American cohorts. Given the clinical utility of the Agatston coronary artery calcium score (CACS) as a gatekeeper to further testing, it has been incorporated in PTP tools such as the CAD2 (CACS) model and the CACS‐weighted clinical likelihood model (CACS‐CL), resulting in its guideline recommendation.

### Performance of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology guideline-recommended pretest probability model for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary artery disease [^111tGuFG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Substantial differences exist between different guideline‐recommended pretest probability (PTP) models for the detection of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). This study was performed to study the performance of the 2021 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guideline‐recommended PTP (AHA/ACC‐PTP) model in assessing the likelihood of obstructive CAD compared with previously proposed models.

Methods and Results

Symptomatic patients (N = 50 561) referred for coronary computed tomography angiography were included. The reference standard was invasive coronary angiography with optional fractional flow reserve measurements. The AHA/ACC‐PTP values based on sex and age were calculated and compared with the 2019 European Society of Cardiology guideline PTP values based on sex, age, and symptoms as well as the risk factor–weighted clinical likelihood values based on sex, age, symptoms, and risk factors. The AHA/ACC‐PTP maximum values overestimated by a factor of 2.6 the actual prevalence of CAD. Compared with the AHA/ACC‐PTP model (area under the receiver‐operating curve, 71.5 [95% CI, 70.7–72.2]), inclusion of typicality of symptoms in the European Society of Cardiology guideline PTP improved discrimination of CAD (area under the receiver‐operating curve, 75.5 [95% CI, 74.7–76.3]). Inclusion of both symptoms and risk factors in the risk factor–weighted clinical likelihood model further improved discrimination (area under the receiver‐operating curve, 77.7 [95% CI, 77.0–78.5]). The proportion of patients classified as very low PTP was lower using the AHA/ACC‐PTP (5%) compared with the European Society of Cardiology guideline PTP (19%) and the risk factor–weighted clinical likelihood (49%) models.

Conclusions

The new AHA/ACC‐PTP model overestimates the prevalence of obstructive CAD substantially if type of symptoms and risk factors are not taken into account. Inclusion of both symptoms and risk factors improves model performance and identifies more patients with very low likelihood of CAD in whom further testing can be deferred.

### External validation of novel clinical likelihood models to predict obstructive coronary artery disease and prognosis [^112Wzq5z]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

CL estimation in chronic coronary syndrome

Recognised as a gap in evidence by the 2019 ESC guidelines on chronic coronary syndrome, the RF-CL and CACS-CL models were developed as tabulated, simple and clinically useful tools for improved prediction of obstructive CAD in patients with de novo chest pain. Other models have been proposed, including the CAD consortium (CADC) clinical and CADC+CACS modelsbut their clinical utility is limited by the need for online calculation.

In general, both the RF-CL and CACS-CL models improved discrimination of obstructive CAD compared with the currently recommended ESC-PTP model (figure 1B). Importantly, the RF-CL and CADC-CL models classified more patients (41.4% and 52.2%, respectively) at very-low CL of obstructive CAD (≤ 5%), where neither European nor North-American guidelines recommend downstream testing. Against a reference standard of obstructive CAD, sensitivity was slightly impaired for the RF-CL and CACS-CL models compared with the ESC-PTP model but across all CL tables, the NPVs remained high (93% to 97%) and obstructive CAD prevalences similar (figure 1C, D). In alignment with the original derivation study, the CACS-CL model also reduced the number of patients with low (5%–15%) CL of obstructive CAD in whom diagnostic testing can be considered without clear guideline recommendations.

In patients with moderate/severe myocardial ischemia but without high-risk CAD by coronary CTA, the International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches authors reported similar prognosis but improved quality of life in patients undergoing revascularisation compared with patients allocated to guideline-directed medical therapy. Thus, one could argue that prognostic CAD should be ruled out by coronary CTA, and referral for invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and potentially revascularisation should be restricted to patients with medically refractory symptoms. CACS is known to be a very strong predictor of obstructive CAD, and discrimination of obstructive coronary lesions improves by the CACS-CL compared with models without CACS utilisation (figure 1). In general, CACS only represents a surrogate for calcified coronary arteriosclerosis and is not a diagnostic test, and the utility of CACS as a tool to stratify patients is debatable.

### External validation of novel clinical likelihood models to predict obstructive coronary artery disease and prognosis [^117NLqJb]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Definition of obstructive CAD

In our study, the ESC-PTP underestimated the observed prevalence of obstructive CAD at coronary CTA less than the RF-CL and CACS-CL models (figure 1A). However, model calibration improved across all risk tables against revascularisation (figure 2A). Based on the 2019 ESC guidelines on chronic coronary syndrome, the ESC-PTP model reflects the probability of obstructive CAD in a pooled analysis from three studies: the PROMISE trial (n = 4415), the CONFIRM registry (n = 8106)and a study by Reeh et al (n = 3291). In the PROMISE and CONFIRM populations, coronary CTA was used as reference standard of obstructive CAD, while Reeh et al used a mixed endpoint of either non-invasive or invasive tests. As (1) the RF-CL and CACS-CL models were derived against ICA as reference for obstructive CAD, and (2) coronary CTA overestimates lesion severity by invasive measures, the improved calibration of the RF-CL and CACS-CL models against revascularisation compared with obstructive CAD at coronary CTA is expected. Importantly, the calibration of CL models is impacted by the chosen reference standard where CL estimates contribute to PTP assessment after advanced non-invasive diagnostic testing. As abnormal non-invasive tests guide potential revascularisation, CL models should be calibrated against ICA, alternatively inducible myocardial ischaemiaand ultimately revascularisation.

Prognosis in chronic coronary syndrome

In our study, the CACS-CL model was superior for the prediction of the clinical endpoint compared with the ESC-PTP (online supplemental table 2). Overall, all CL models found patients with very-low CL to have a 5-year absolute risk < 1.0% of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death (figure 3). Importantly, the ESC-PTP, RF-CL and CACS-CL models are all calibrated against obstructive CAD whereas myocardial infarction also occurs in non-obstructive lesions in 1 of 10 patients. Patients with non-obstructive lesions are presumably missed by models not integrating CACS though CACS only surrogates coronary atherosclerosis by outlining coronary calcification. However, event rates of the clinical endpoint were similar for low and moderate/high CL patients by the CACS-CL model (table 2).

Overall, our findings are consistent with previous studies, and the improved very-low CL categorisation by the RF-CL and CACS-CL models seem safe across various study cohorts.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Stable chest pain, low-risk patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD) — outpatient risk modeling and first-line testing: For patients with stable chest pain and no known CAD presenting to the outpatient clinic, a model to estimate pretest probability of obstructive CAD is effective to identify patients at low risk for obstructive CAD and favorable prognosis in whom additional diagnostic testing can be deferred; for patients categorized as low risk, coronary artery calcium (CAC) testing is reasonable as a first-line test for excluding calcified plaque and identifying patients with a low likelihood of obstructive CAD, and exercise testing without imaging is reasonable as a first-line test for excluding myocardial ischemia and determining functional capacity in patients with an interpretable electrocardiogram (ECG).

### Performance of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology guideline-recommended pretest probability model for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary artery disease [^114txTv5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

On the basis of testing in a large contemporary cohort, the 2021 AHA/ACC guideline on chest pain recommended PTP models based on age and sex overestimate the probability of CAD when using the given "maximal" values. Clinicians should therefore substantially reduce these values during patient consultation to ensure accurate estimation of the probability of obstructive CAD.

Use of more granular symptom classification, inclusion of risk factors, yields more accurate estimation of PTP with an increased reclassification potential and more patients in whom further testing can be deferred. Because of the superiority of the RF‐CL model and previous external validation, we would recommend clinicians to use this model for accurate individualized calculation of patients' PTP of obstructive CAD.

### Comparison of international guidelines for assessment of suspected Stable angina: insights from the PROMISE and SCOT-HEART [^112YfxUd]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The safe and efficient assessment of individuals presenting with suspected stable angina is fraught with challenge. At an individual level, clinicians and patients alike are highly motivated to determine the cause of symptoms and identify the presence of underlying coronary artery disease (CAD) that may place the patient at high risk of future cardiovascular events. Given the resource-intensive nature of cardiac investigations, this tendency toward risk aversion must be balanced on a population level by efficient diagnostic pathways that minimize unnecessary or inappropriate testing.

Optimizing this balance of safety and efficiency underpins the principles of international clinical guidelines. In recent years, 3 distinct approaches have been independently adopted by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), and the U.K. National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Both the ACC/AHA and ESC guidelines adopt the concept of Bayesian probability whereby initial estimation of prior probability is updated according to diagnostic test results to determine the post-test probability of obstructive CAD. Within these risk-based strategies, pre-test probability (PTP) is determined from the DF-CASS (Diamond-Forrester/Coronary Artery Surgery Study) (ACC/AHA)and CADC (Coronary Artery Disease Consortium) (ESC)clinical risk scores that incorporate age, sex, and chest pain typicality. Knowledge of PTP is used to categorize patients into 1 of 3 diagnostic risk groups: low; intermediate; or high. Both guidelines agree that noninvasive testing for CAD has greatest utility (Class I recommendation) in the intermediate-risk group, which is arbitrarily defined as 10% to 90% in the United States and 15% to 85% in Europe. In contrast, the recently updated NICE guidance for the diagnosis of suspected stable angina has abandoned this probabilistic approach in favor of a symptom-focused assessment. Following clinical evaluation, patients adjudged to have typical or atypical symptoms or an abnormal resting electrocardiogram are categorized into a possible angina group for whom additional noninvasive imaging with coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is recommended. The remainder are classified as nonanginal, and no further testing is indicated.

### Calcium scoring improves clinical Management in patients with Low clinical likelihood of coronary Artery Disease [^115a5VwY]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronary artery calcium scoring (CACS) improves management of chest pain patients. However, it is unknown whether the benefit of CACS is dependent on the clinical likelihood (CL).

Objectives

This study aims to investigate for which patients CACS has the greatest benefit when added to a CL model.

Methods

Based on data from a clinical database, the CL of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) was calculated for 39,837 patients referred for cardiac imaging due to symptoms suggestive of obstructive CAD. Patients were categorized according to the risk factor-weighted (RF-CL) model (very low, ≤ 5%; low, > 5 to ≤ 15%; moderate > 15 to ≤ 50%; high, > 50%). CL was then recalculated incorporating the CACS result (CACS-CL). Reclassification rates and the number needed to test with CACS to reclassify patients were calculated and validated in 3 independent cohorts (n = 9,635).

Results

In total, 15,358 (39%) patients were down- or upclassified after including CACS. Reclassification rates were 8%, 75%, 53%, and 30% in the very low, low, moderate, and high RF-CL categories, respectively. Reclassification to very low CACS-CL occurred in 48% of reclassified patients. The number needed to test to reclassify 1 patient from low RF-CL to very low CACS-CL was 2.1 with consistency across age, sex, and cohorts. CACS-CL correlated better to obstructive CAD prevalence than RF-CL.

Conclusions

Added to an RF-CL model for obstructive CAD, CACS identifies more patients unlikely to benefit from further testing. The number needed to test with CACS to reclassify patients depends on the pretest RF-CL and is lowest in patients with low (> 5% to ≤ 15%) likelihood of CAD.

### Clinical likelihood prediction of hemodynamically obstructive coronary Artery disease in patients with Stable chest pain [^116pKbf4]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Selection for invasive angiography is recommended to be based on pretest probabilities (PTPs), and physiological measures of hemodynamical impairment by, for example, fractional flow reserve (FFR) should guide revascularization. The risk factor-weighted clinical likelihood (RF-CL) and coronary artery calcium score-weighted clinical likelihood (CACS-CL) models show superior discrimination of patients with suspected obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), but validation against hemodynamic impairment is warranted.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to validate the RF-CL and CACS-CL models against hemodynamically obstructive CAD.

Methods

Stable de novo chest pain patients (N = 4,371) underwent coronary computed tomography angiography and subsequently invasive coronary angiography with FFR measurements. Hemodynamically obstructive CAD was defined as invasive FFR ≤ 0.80 or high-grade stenosis by visual assessment (> 90% diameter stenosis). For comparison, a guideline-endorsed basic PTP model was calculated based on age, sex, and symptom typicality. The RF-CL model additionally included the number of risk factors, and the CACS-CL model incorporated the coronary artery calcium score into the RF-CL.

Results

In total, 447 of 4,371 (10.9%) patients had hemodynamically obstructive CAD. Both the RF-CL and CACS-CL models classified more patients with a very low clinical likelihood (≤ 5%) of obstructive CAD compared to the basic PTP model (33.0% and 53.7% vs 12.0%; P < 0.001) with a preserved low prevalence of hemodynamically obstructive CAD (< 5% for all models). Against hemodynamically obstructive CAD, calibration and discrimination of the RF-CL and CACS-CL models were superior to the basic PTP model.

Conclusions

The RF-CL and CACS-CL models are well calibrated and superior to a currently recommended basic PTP model to predict hemodynamically obstructive CAD.

### Performance of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology guideline-recommended pretest probability model for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary artery disease [^114BSBmV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background Substantial differences exist between different guideline-recommended pretest probability (PTP) models for the detection of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). This study was performed to study the performance of the 2021 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guideline-recommended PTP (AHA/ACC-PTP) model in assessing the likelihood of obstructive CAD compared with previously proposed models. Methods and Results Symptomatic patients (N = 50561) referred for coronary computed tomography angiography were included. The reference standard was invasive coronary angiography with optional fractional flow reserve measurements. The AHA/ACC-PTP values based on sex and age were calculated and compared with the 2019 European Society of Cardiology guideline PTP values based on sex, age, and symptoms as well as the risk factor-weighted clinical likelihood values based on sex, age, symptoms, and risk factors. The AHA/ACC-PTP maximum values overestimated by a factor of 2.6 the actual prevalence of CAD. Compared with the AHA/ACC-PTP model (area under the receiver-operating curve, 71.5 [95% CI, 70.7–72.2]), inclusion of typicality of symptoms in the European Society of Cardiology guideline PTP improved discrimination of CAD (area under the receiver-operating curve, 75.5 [95% CI, 74.7–76.3]). Inclusion of both symptoms and risk factors in the risk factor-weighted clinical likelihood model further improved discrimination (area under the receiver-operating curve, 77.7 [95% CI, 77.0–78.5]). The proportion of patients classified as very low PTP was lower using the AHA/ACC-PTP (5%) compared with the European Society of Cardiology guideline PTP (19%) and the risk factor-weighted clinical likelihood (49%) models. Conclusions The new AHA/ACC-PTP model overestimates the prevalence of obstructive CAD substantially if type of symptoms and risk factors are not taken into account. Inclusion of both symptoms and risk factors improves model performance and identifies more patients with very low likelihood of CAD in whom further testing can be deferred.

### Simplified approach to predicting obstructive coronary disease with integration of coronary calcium: development and external validation [^116nhKau]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Accurately estimating a patient's likelihood of obstructive CAD is central to informing diagnostic strategies and management plans. To this end, guidelines suggest that physicians use contemporary risk scores, in conjunction with clinical factors, such as age and CAC information, when available. Although various likelihood algorithms have been proposed, there is a need to make their use as simple as possible to foster widespread clinical use. To address this need, we developed simplified likelihood tables to predict a patient's likelihood of having obstructive CAD from age, sex, chest pain history, and CAC. Simplification is useful only if it does not result in a significant loss of diagnostic accuracy. We found that our simplified likelihood tables had high predictive performance for obstructive CAD, including higher prediction performance in external testing compared with the CAD Consortium models. More important, although prediction performance was higher, the likelihood tables should be substantially easier to use as no calculations are required. In addition, the likelihood tables have improved calibration compared with the CAD Consortium models, suggesting good correlation between predicted and actual likelihood of obstructive CAD. Last, prediction performance for the likelihood tables was similar to more complicated models when applied in a higher‐risk population undergoing PET. This information could potentially be used by physicians to make decisions on testing or treatment strategies for patients with suspected obstructive CAD.

For many years, the original Diamond‐Forrester model was used extensively for estimating a patient's pretest probability of obstructive CAD. An important characteristic of its appeal was its ease of use. The relationship between symptoms, sex, and likelihood of obstructive CAD could be determined with a quick glance. However, the original Diamond‐Forrester model was developed when the prevalence of obstructive CAD was significantly higher than today. Since then, advances in therapeutics and prevention have resulted in a marked decline in the incidence of severity of myocardial infarctionand frequency of inducible myocardial ischemia. Correspondingly, the original Diamond‐Forrester algorithm overestimates the likelihood of obstructive CAD in contemporary populations. Since this realization, there has been a concerted effort to develop an updated algorithm for predicting obstructive CAD, which would perform well in contemporary populations and be broadly accepted into clinical practice.

### Validation of the European Society of Cardiology pre-test probability model for obstructive coronary artery disease [^116XkNEy]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

Estimation of pre-test probability (PTP) of disease in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common challenge. Due to decreasing prevalence of obstructive CAD in patients referred for diagnostic testing, the European Society of Cardiology suggested a new PTP (2019-ESC-PTP) model. The aim of this study was to validate that model.

Methods and Results

Symptomatic patients referred for coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) due to suspected CAD in a geographical uptake area of 3.3 million inhabitants were included. The reference standard was a combined endpoint of CTA and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with obstructive CAD defined at ICA as a ≥ 50% diameter stenosis or fractional flow reserve ≤ 0.80 when performed. The 2019-ESC-PTP, 2013-ESC-PTP, and CAD Consortium basic PTP scores were calculated based on age, sex, and symptoms. Of the 42 328 identified patients, coronary stenosis was detected in 8.8% using the combined endpoint. The 2019-ESC-PTP and CAD Consortium basic scores classified substantially more patients into the low PTP groups (PTP < 15%) than did the 2013-ESC-PTP (64% and 65% vs. 16%, P < 0.001). Using the combined endpoint as reference, calibration of the 2019-ESC-PTP model was superior to the 2013-ESC-PTP and CAD Consortium basic score.

Conclusion

The new 2019-ESC-PTP model is well calibrated and superior to the previously recommended models in predicting obstructive stenosis detected by a combined endpoint of CTA and ICA.

Model Calibration

Calibration plots for the overall cohort using all 8 models are shown (Figure 2A). Of the non‐CACS models, the LAH clinical fitted best with no significant deviation between observed and expected cases (χ 2 5.8; P = 0.12). The least well‐fitted was RF‐CL (χ 2 436.4; P < 0.001), followed by ESC‐PTP (χ 2 135.2; P < 0.001), CAD2 clinical (χ 2 108.2; P < 0.001), and AHA/ACC‐PTP (χ 2 38.2; P < 0.001), respectively. Of the CACS incorporating models, LAH (CACS) showed the least deviation between observed and expected cases (χ 2 37.5; P < 0.001), followed by CAD2 (CACS) (χ 2 56.6; P < 0.001) and CACS‐CL (χ 2 295.9; P < 0.001). Overall, the LAH clinical and LAH (CACS) models most closely estimated risk. This was followed by the AHA/ACC‐PTP. All other models underestimated risk, with the RF‐CL and CAC‐CL models underestimating to the largest extent. In general, models incorporating CACS showed a better fit than their non‐CACS counterparts.

### Incorporating coronary calcification into pre-test assessment of the likelihood of coronary artery disease [^1124JdXK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in symptomatic patients referred for diagnostic testing has declined, warranting optimization of individualized diagnostic strategies.

Objectives

This study sought to present a simple, clinically applicable tool enabling estimation of the likelihood of obstructive CAD by combining a pre-test probability (PTP) model (Diamond-Forrester approach using sex, age, and symptoms) with clinical risk factors and coronary artery calcium score (CACS).

Methods

The new tool was developed in a cohort of symptomatic patients (n = 41,177) referred for diagnostic testing. The risk factor-weighted clinical likelihood (RF-CL) was calculated through PTP and risk factors, while the CACS-weighted clinical likelihood (CACS-CL) added CACS. The 2 calculation models were validated in European and North American cohorts (n = 15,411) and compared with a recently updated PTP table.

Results

The RF-CL and CACS-CL models predicted the prevalence of obstructive CAD more accurately in the validation cohorts than the PTP model, and markedly increased the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves of obstructive CAD: for the PTP model, 72 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 71 to 74); for the RF-CL model, 75 (95% CI: 74 to 76); and for the CACS-CL model, 85 (95% CI: 84 to 86). In total, 38% of the patients in the RF-CL group and 54% in the CACS-CL group were categorized as having a low clinical likelihood of CAD, as compared with 11% with the PTP model.

Conclusions

A simple risk factor and CACS-CL tool enables improved prediction and discrimination of patients with suspected obstructive CAD. The tool empowers reclassification of patients to low likelihood of CAD, who need no further testing.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2022). High credibility.

Pre-test probability in obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) — age, sex, and symptom-based model with imaging options — is outlined with explicit chest pain definitions and example values. Chest pain is evaluated by three characteristics, and "TYPICAL ANGINA: meets all 3 characteristics", "ATYPICAL ANGINA: meets any 2 characteristics", and "NON-ANGINAL Chest Pain: meets only 1 or none of these characteristics". Representative pre-test probability (PTP) percentages for ages 60–69 are: typical angina men 44% and women 16%, atypical angina men 26% and women 11%, non-anginal men 22% and women 6%, and dyspnea men 27% and women 14%. Imaging test options listed are No test, CACS/CTA, Functional test, and Invasive angiogram, and PTP estimation "can be complemented with other data" including risk factors and biomarkers such as "Q or ST abnormalities in ECG, low EF, or WMA".

CL models and prognosis

The clinical endpoint of non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death occurred in 17/1585 (1.1%) patients. Overall, event rates increased with increasing ESC-PTP, RF-CL and CACS-CL (table 2 and figure 3). Importantly, patients with very-low CL across all CL models had very low event rates ≤ 0.1%, and no event rate differences were observed for patients categorised with very-low, low or intermediate/high CL between the ESC-PTP, RF-CL and CACS-CL models, respectively.

### Coronary artery calcium score and pre-test probabilities as gatekeepers to predict and rule out perfusion defects in positron emission tomography [^114Vu8jz]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

New knowledge gained

CACS alone or combined with pre-test probabilities as post-test probabilities show a better discrimination capacity than pre-test probabilities from AHA/ACC or ESC guidelines for perfusion defects in PET. All of them can rule out such defects with very high negative predictive value: ≥ 96% for abnormal perfusion and ≥ 99% for severe ischemia. But CACS and post-test probabilities rule out perfusion defects in many more participants than pre-test-probabilities (23–37% vs. 2–7%), thus can identify substantially more people for whom PET may not be necessary. Therefore, CACS and post-test probabilities should be considered as low-cost, low-radiation, but high-performance gatekeepers to rule out perfusion defects before advanced imaging tests. Our Figure 3 can support decision-making in clinical routine. This gatekeeping approach using CACS and post-test probabilities may save costs, radiation, and time by identifying patients very unlikely to show perfusion defects due to significant CAD.

### Pre-test characteristics of unstable angina patients with obstructive coronary artery disease confirmed by coronary angiography [^1113pYHg]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that by structuring symptom characteristics and clinical variables it may be possible to postpone or cancel acute CAG in over half of the patients referred with presumed UA. This would reduce cost for healthcare systems, avoid exposing patients to unnecessary risk of complications and release capacity for more critical diagnoses. Prospective studies are needed to validate our findings.

### A clinical model to identify patients with high-risk coronary artery disease [^111AbadG]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to develop a clinical model that identifies patients with and without high-risk coronary artery disease (CAD).

Background

Although current clinical models help to estimate a patient's pre-test probability of obstructive CAD, they do not accurately identify those patients with and without high-risk coronary anatomy.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected multinational coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) cohort was conducted. High-risk anatomy was defined as left main diameter stenosis ≥ 50%, 3-vessel disease with diameter stenosis ≥ 70%, or 2-vessel disease involving the proximal left anterior descending artery. Using a cohort of 27,125, patients with a history of CAD, cardiac transplantation, and congenital heart disease were excluded. The model was derived from 24,251 consecutive patients in the derivation cohort and an additional 7,333 nonoverlapping patients in the validation cohort.

Results

The risk score consisted of 9 variables: age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, current smoking, hyperlipidemia, family history of CAD, history of peripheral vascular disease, and chest pain symptoms. Patients were divided into 3 risk categories: low (≤ 7 points), intermediate (8 to 17 points) and high (≥ 18 points). The model was statistically robust with area under the curve of 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75 to 0.78) in the derivation cohort and 0.71 (95% CI: 0.69 to 0.74) in the validation cohort. Patients who scored ≤ 7 points had a low negative likelihood ratio (< 0.1), whereas patients who scored ≥ 18 points had a high specificity of 99.3% and a positive likelihood ratio (8.48). In the validation group, the prevalence of high-risk CAD was 1% in patients with ≤ 7 points and 16.7% in those with ≥ 18 points.

Conclusions

We propose a scoring system, based on clinical variables, that can be used to identify patients at high and low pre-test probability of having high-risk CAD. Identification of these populations may detect those who may benefit from a trial of medical therapy and those who may benefit most from an invasive strategy.

### Incorporating coronary artery calcium scoring in the prediction of obstructive coronary artery disease with myocardial ischemia: a study with sequential use of coronary computed tomography angiography and positron emission tomography imaging [^115V6Zh8]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Traditionally, myocardial ischemia has been the gatekeeper for invasive coronary angiography and subsequent revascularization. However, many symptomatic patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) do not have myocardial ischemia. – Hence, alternative strategies are warranted in order to improve the referral for ischemia testing of this specific group of patients. Currently, European guidelines recommend physicians to estimate the pre-test probability of obstructive CAD — as a surrogate of myocardial ischemia– using the Diamond-Forrester approach by integrating age, sex and cardiac symptoms. Additional information on the clinical profile of patients, such as the presence and extent of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and coronary artery calcium (CAC), holds potential to further refine these often overestimating pre-test probabilities of myocardial ischemia. Coronary artery calcium scoring (CACS) seems particularly desirable since it is easily performed using non-contrast computed tomography (CT), requiring no intravenous contrast, low radiation exposure and lower costs (as compared to contrast-enhanced CT). Also, the extent of CACS has been described to correlate well with ischemia. Nevertheless, the optimal use of CACS in improving the pre-test probability assessment of ischemia has yet to be established in a large contemporary patient cohort. Therefore, the present study aimed to compare three models to predict obstructive CAD with myocardial ischemia on positron emission tomography (PET) in symptomatic patients with suspected CAD: (1) a basic model: including age, sex and cardiac symptoms, (2) a risk factor model: adding number of risk factors to the basic model, and (3) a CACS model: adding CACS to the risk factor model.

Guidelines and pre-test probability in stable chest pain — NICE and ESC: Prior NICE guidance recommended no further investigations for PTP < 10%, coronary artery calcium scoring (CACS) for PTP 10–29%, functional imaging for PTP 30–60% and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) for PTP 61–90%. The 2016 NICE update recommended CTA (on a ≥ 64-slice CT scanner) as the first line test, regardless of PTP, in patients with typical or atypical anginal symptoms or ECG findings consistent with significant CAD; functional imaging was recommended only in those with equivocal CTA or with known CAD, and ICA was recommended as a third-line investigation or when the functional imaging was non-diagnostic. With contemporary data, recalibration resulted in PTP values approximately one-third of those in the previous guidelines. Modeling showed CTA was the most cost-effective first line investigation at all levels of disease prevalence (25%, 45% and 75%) when assessed against both 50% and 70% thresholds. In SCOT-HEART and PROMISE comparisons, the c-statistic for identifying obstructive CAD favored the NICE strategy (0.634 vs 0.594 for ESC and 0.560 for ACC), and a NICE technology review concluded that FFRCT was a robust and valuable modality when added to CTA.

### Pre-test characteristics of unstable angina patients with obstructive coronary artery disease confirmed by coronary angiography [^111V1Jad]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

In sensitivity analyses of the 340 patients included after the implementation of hs-cTnT, the AUC of the multivariabel model improved from 0.77 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.80) to 0.81 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.85, although with larger CIs) (online supplementary Table 1). The derived risk score performed similarly on the subpopulation with OR of 1.39 (95% CI 1.28 to 1.52). With a cut-off level of < 13, we were able to exclude or delay 59% of the patients (n = 201) to acute CAG with an NPV of 96% for prognostic CAD. Further, with a cut-off level of < 9 the score demonstrated an NPV of 96% for any obstructive CAD in 21% of the patients (n = 73) (online supplementary Table 2).

### Clinical pre-test probability for obstructive coronary artery disease: insights from the European DISCHARGE pilot study [^116ZeDhc]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Examination results and accuracy of pre-test probability prediction

The overall prevalence of obstructive CAD was 31.7% (456 of 1441 patients; Figure 3). In detail, the prevalence was higher in the ICA group (45.1%; 322 of 715 patients) compared with the CT group (18.5%; 134 of 725 patients; p < 0.001), and the overall prevalence ranged between 15.3% and 49.2% among the 25 clinical sites (Supplementary material, Online Figure 1). In the ICA group, the prevalence at the individual clinical sites ranged between 23.3% and 76.7%, and between 3.4% and 34.5% in the CT group.

Pre-test probability and coronary artery disease (CAD) prevalence. A total of 725 patients underwent CT, and 715 underwent ICA. The average prevalence of obstructive CAD in the entire population was 32% with a higher prevalence in the ICA group (45%) versus the CT group (19%). The actual disease probability was relevantly overestimated by both prediction models with a higher overestimation of disease prevalence for the initial version compared with the updated D+F (p < 0.001). This overestimation again was higher in the CT group compared with that in the ICA group (p < 0.001)

### Performance of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology guideline-recommended pretest probability model for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary artery disease [^1111QdWZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In the present study, the assessment of probability of obstructive CAD according to the 2021 AHA/ACC guideline on chest pain was evaluated. Increasing evidence supports a pretest probability‐guided use of diagnostic testing. The benefits include more effective use of the diagnostic tests and avoidance of unnecessary testing. However, the benefits can be achieved only when the applied PTP values are correctly reflecting the prevalence of CAD in the population.

The new simplified model in the AHA/ACC guideline provides only estimates for the "maximal" PTP values of obstructive CAD in patients with chest pain. The guideline recommends that the clinicians should downgrade the PTP estimates using information about the type of symptoms and risk factors but provides no concrete tools apart from a graph with visual down ramping of PTP in patients with less typical symptoms. On the basis of the current analysis, the PTP values in the guideline are overestimated on average by a factor of 2.6 in patients with any chest pain. In patients with nonanginal chest pain and atypical angina, the overestimation was a factor of 4.8 and 3.1, respectively. The current analysis also demonstrates that with inclusion of the type of symptoms and risk factors, as performed in the RF‐CL model, accurate classification is feasible and leads to substantial PTP down‐classification, resulting in 47% of patients having a likelihood of obstructive CAD ≤ 5%.

### Coronary artery calcium score and pre-test probabilities as gatekeepers to predict and rule out perfusion defects in positron emission tomography [^117VV2T9]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The recommended pre-test probabilities were recently recalibrated and updated, which led to changes in AHA/ACC guidelines and ESC guidelines. These new pre-test probabilities are therefore more appropriate for current data than older versions used in previous works. Current guidelines are not identical: ESC guidelines attribute different pre-test probabilities for typical, atypical and non-anginal chest pain, but AHA/ACC guidelines use pre-test probabilities of typical chest pain for any chest pain. This most likely explains why AHA/ACC pre-test and post-test probabilities overestimated real probabilities in calibration analysis, and why they tend towards higher sensitivity and NPV. By contrast, ESC probabilities were better calibrated, tended towards higher discriminative capacity and classified more participants at low probability. Thus, AHA/ACC pre- and post-test probabilities might be slightly safer for gatekeeping, but ESC pre- and post-test probabilities rule out perfusion defects in more participants.

### NCT06029387… [^117Eat1S]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Artificial Intelligence for Preventing Heart Disease: Observational, Single Center, Prospective and Retrospective Study ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Background and Rationale In recent years, cCTA has become a crucial diagnostic tool for suspected CAD, recommended as the first-line test for patients with an intermediate pre-test probability of CAD by the European Society of Cardiology guidelines and the American HeartAssociation and Italian guidelines, because of the well-known high negative predictive value of cCTA in ruling out obstructive CAD. However, most patients have non-obstructive CAD. To date, many approaches have been proposed to tackle this issue.

However, these proposed solutions lack the ability to provide quantitative and reproducible results with a sufficiently strong predictive value, are often proposed as a stand-alone solution without the integration with multiple prognosticator imaging and clinical parameters, and are not delivered through platforms capable of providing external validation and easy integration in the clinical workflow. However, these approaches may be hampered by low reproducibility, especially among different scanner vendors. Interestingly, a new research has also shown that, besides coronary artery vessel wall characteristics, pericoronary adipose tissue attenuation carries significant predictive value, as it reflects the state of coronary inflammation that plays a key role in the development and progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

All these CAD characteristics are often analyzed independently from one to another, reducing their potential synergistic prognostic value and creating redundant variables that have negligible effect on prognosis. We propose an AI-based analysis that can integrate all this data in order to select the most important determinant of CAD progression and to discard futile features, thus creating an agile and clinically valuable risk stratification model. Furthermore, we plan to create a novel imaging marker of CAD with unfavorable outcome, to be integrated in the AI-based model, which will be based on topological features of the coronary artery tree. Thus, this novel biomarker may carry a significant prognostic role. Based on these premises, our research aims to develop a novel clinical-imaging AI-based model to identify and categorize patients at high risk of disease progression and provide a more personalized management approach to improve patient outcomes.

However, besides the primary objective of creating an AI-based model for CAD risk stratification, we aim to overcome some issues that currently hamper the widespread clinical application of AI in cardiovascular care. In fact, it is recognized that the integration of AI-based applications into the clinical workflow, which will increase usability and decrease costs, is currently lacking.

### Prediction of obstructive coronary artery disease and prognosis in patients with suspected stable angina [^112qJYAV]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

We hypothesized that the modified Diamond-Forrester (D-F) prediction model overestimates probability of coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim of this study was to update the prediction model based on pre-test information and assess the model's performance in predicting prognosis in an unselected, contemporary population suspected of angina.

Methods and Results

We included 3903 consecutive patients free of CAD and heart failure and suspected of angina, who were referred to a single centre for assessment in 2012–15. Obstructive CAD was defined from invasive angiography as lesion requiring revascularization, > 70% stenosis or fractional flow reserve < 0.8. Patients were followed (mean follow-up 33months) for myocardial infarction, unstable angina, heart failure, stroke, and death. The updated D-F prediction model overestimated probability considerably: mean pre-test probability was 31.4%, while only 274 (7%) were diagnosed with obstructive CAD. A basic prediction model with age, gender, and symptoms demonstrated good discrimination with C-statistics of 0.86 (95% CI 0.84–0.88), while a clinical prediction model adding diabetes, family history, and dyslipidaemia slightly improved the C-statistic to 0.88 (0.86–0.90) (P for difference between models < 0.0001). Quartiles of probability of CAD from the clinical prediction model provided good diagnostic and prognostic stratification: in the lowest quartiles there were no cases of obstructive CAD and cumulative risk of the composite endpoint was less than 3% at 2years.

Conclusion

The pre-test probability model recommended in current ESC guidelines substantially overestimates likelihood of CAD when applied to a contemporary, unselected, all-comer population. We provide an updated prediction model that identifies subgroups with low likelihood of obstructive CAD and good prognosis in which non-invasive testing may safely be deferred.

### Exercise electrocardiography for pre-test assessment of the likelihood of coronary artery disease [^111ijqhf]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To develop a tool including exercise electrocardiography (ExECG) for patient-specific clinical likelihood estimation of patients with suspected obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD).

Methods

An ExECG-weighted clinical likelihood (ExECG-CL) model was developed in a training cohort of patients with suspected obstructive CAD undergoing ExECG. Next, the ExECG-CL model was applied in a CAD validation cohort undergoing ExECG and clinically driven invasive coronary angiography and a prognosis validation cohort and compared with the risk factor-weighted clinical likelihood (RF-CL) model for obstructive CAD discrimination and prognostication, respectively. In the CAD validation cohort, obstructive CAD was defined as > 50% diameter stenosis on invasive coronary angiography. For prognosis, the endpoint was non-fatal myocardial infarction and death.

Results

The training cohort consisted of 1214 patients (mean age 57years, 57% males). In the CAD (N = 408; mean age 55years, 53% males) and prognosis validation (N = 3283; mean age 57years, 57% males) cohorts, 11.8% patients had obstructive CAD and 4.4% met the endpoint. In the CAD validation cohort, discrimination of obstructive CAD was similar between the ExECG-CL and RF-CL models: area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves 83.1% (95% CIs 77.5% to 88.7%) versus 80.7% (95% CI 74.6% to 86.8%), p = 0.14. In the ExECG-CL model, more patients had very low (≤ 5%) clinical likelihood of obstructive CAD compared with the RF-CL (42.2% vs 36.0%, p < 0.01) where obstructive CAD prevalence and event risk remained low.

Conclusions

ExECG incorporated into a clinical likelihood model improves reclassification of patients to a very low clinical likelihood group with very low prevalence of obstructive CAD and favourable prognosis.

### Coronary artery calcium score and pre-test probabilities as gatekeepers to predict and rule out perfusion defects in positron emission tomography [^115u95yj]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

This study has some limitations. First, endpoints were perfusion defects in PET, not obstructive CAD in ICA. But systematically performing ICA in patients suspected of CAD would yield an unfavorable risk/benefit ratio and disregard current guidelines. With very high diagnostic performance for CAD, PET is the best proxy for hemodynamically significant CAD on ICA, and an excellent predictor of adverse outcomes.– Thus, predicting PET findings effectively predicts CAD and outcomes. CACS is also known to be an outstanding outcome predictor, alone or combined with PET findings. Moreover, the good calibration of pre-test-ESC for abnormal perfusion highlighted a good correspondence of our abnormal perfusion with the endpoint used to calibrate pre-test-probabilities: obstructive CAD on coronary CT. Second, our definitions of abnormal findings in PET differed from other studies. But we used current guidelines to define our primary endpoint, and chose secondary endpoints associated with worse prognosis and affecting treatment decisions. Third, image assessment was performed on a routine basis with access to patient data. However, CACS is an objective, computer-based measurement, and PET was assessed by the same experts throughout the study. Fourth, the usefulness of ischemia testing and of revascularization for stable CAD have been questioned by the ISCHEMIA trial through a lack of benefit on hard outcomes. However, high-risk participants with main stem lesions were excluded from this trial, and revascularization improved quality of life, angina, and nonprocedural infarction, as confirmed by a later meta-analysis. – Thus, ischemia testing and revascularization remained recommended after ISCHEMIA. Our work also has several strengths: the large prospective database, the detailed patient data including symptoms, allowing for calculation of pre-test probabilities, the comparison with the new pre-test-AHA/ACC and pre-test-ESC, the use of PET as the most accurate non-invasive method to assess myocardial perfusion, and the extensive analysis including a Bayesian approach with a focus on gatekeeping.

### Prediction model to estimate presence of coronary artery disease: retrospective pooled analysis of existing cohorts [^1117Kk3L]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Design overview

Researchers from Europe and the US formed a consortium. An existing database of at least 80 eligible patients was required for participation. Participation did not involve any financial incentives. All patients had to be enrolled in single centre studies, and local approval from the institutional review board for the original research objectives was required. The consortium is part of the European network for the assessment of imaging in medicine, which is an initiative of the European Institute of Biomedical Imaging Research. One of the network's goals was to perform pooled analyses of existing prospectively collected data, improving power and increasing generalisability of results.

Participants

Patients were eligible for the analysis if they presented with stable chest pain and were referred for catheter based or CT based coronary angiography (≥ 64 slice). Patients were not eligible if they had acute coronary syndrome or unstable chest pain, had a history of myocardial infarction or previous revascularisation (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery), or provided no informed consent. For the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, catheter based coronary angiography is regarded as the reference standard, which is an expensive and invasive procedure with a risk of complications. Non-invasive testing is generally recommended to select patients who might benefit from catheter based coronary angiography. CT based coronary angiography is a less invasive and less expensive test, with a high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of coronary artery disease on catheter based coronary angiography. A negative result from CT based coronary angiography virtually excludes the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease, whereas a positive result might need confirmation by the catheter based test.

Fourteen datasets consisted of consecutive patients enrolled in a prospective study for other research objectives. Four datasets consisted of patients retrospectively identified as eligible via electronic radiology reporting systems. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were evaluated by experienced doctors and missing information was obtained from patient records (web appendix table 1).

Discriminative ability and NET reclassification analysis

The discriminative ability was stronger for the updated D+F 2011 with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.73 (AUC; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70–0.76; Fig. 4) compared with an AUC of 0.70 (CI 0.67–0.73) for the initial D+F prediction model (p < 0.001). The discriminative ability differed between the 25 clinical sites (Supplementary material, Online Figure 2). The logistic regression analysis with random intercept for the site showed a significant effect of the method with a coefficient equal to 0.44. This corresponds to an odds ratio of 1.55 (95% CI 1.29–1.86; Table 2). Thus, this result is in favour of the updated D+F model. There is also substantial variability between sites measured by the variance of the random intercepts with a value of 0.14.

Fig. 4
Comparison of the discriminative power of pre-test probability prediction models. The discriminative ability was higher for the updated D+F 2011 compared with the initial D+F prediction model. The AUC, which is a parameter of the discriminative ability, was 0.73 for the updated D+F (AUC; 95% confidence [CI] interval 0.70–0.76). The initial D+F had an AUC of 0.70 (95% CI 0.67–0.73; p < 0.001)

### Prediction model to estimate presence of coronary artery disease: retrospective pooled analysis of existing cohorts [^113f8jHY]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Finally, our analysis focused on the diagnostic prediction of the presence of coronary artery disease, defined as at least 50% diameter stenosis in at least one vessel, shown on catheter based coronary angiography. Predicting severe disease (for example, ≥ 70% stenosis in the left anterior descending coronary artery, three vessel disease, or left main coronary artery disease) would be helpful as a tool to select patients for revascularisation. However, the main purpose of the current analysis was the development of prediction models to help physicians select patients who would benefit from further testing.

Future directions

Other non-invasive imaging tests for the evaluation of patients with chest pain should also be considered as predictors for the presence of coronary artery disease. Furthermore, cost effectiveness analyses should be performed to establish appropriate thresholds for diagnostic testing, taking into account the long term benefits and harms.

Clinical implications

We showed that the Duke clinical score overestimates the likelihood of coronary artery disease, and we believe that our model improves the estimate of the pretest probability. By contrast with the Duke clinical score, we developed and validated our model using data from different hospitals, settings, countries, and included hypertension as a predictor. Finally, our model does not need inclusion of resting electrocardiography findings, which could be convenient in primary practice.

A refined estimate of the probability of coronary artery disease allows doctors to make better decisions as to which diagnostic test is best in a particular patient, according to NICE guidelines, and to decide on further management based on the results of such tests. Our stepwise models can be used to evaluate the added value of performing coronary calcium score either before performing the test or after obtaining the calcium score. Our analysis shows that the coronary calcium score significantly improves the estimate of the probability of coronary artery disease, suggesting that the score should be considered for patients with chest pain. Use of the coronary calcium score is not routinely recommended by the guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Associationor the European Society of Cardiology, whereas the UK guidelines recommend use of the score if the pretest probability is 10–29%. However, triage strategies using the coronary calcium score have been proposedand are implemented in several centres. In this context, our prediction calculator could be used both to determine whether using the coronary calcium score is clinically useful (by checking whether the score alters the probability of coronary artery disease such that clinical management would change) and to determine the revised probability of coronary artery disease, based on the score's result.

### Pre-test characteristics of unstable angina patients with obstructive coronary artery disease confirmed by coronary angiography [^115eKeoh]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Endpoint

As the mortality is very low in patients with UA in the hs-cTn era, we chose obstructive CAD as the primary endpoint of our analyses. To ensure high sensitivity, obstructive CAD was defined as ≥ 50% angiographic diameter stenosis or fraction flow reserve < 0.8 in any epicardial coronary artery. We defined obstructive CAD in the main stem, proximal left anterior descending artery or in all three main coronary vessels (three-vessel disease) as prognostically significant CAD.UA resembles stable angina, both having negative hs-cTn and low mortality compared with MI, and an unsure prognostic benefit of revascularisation. Therefore, we assumed no immediate yield of acute revascularisation in the hs-cTn-negative UA patients without prognostically significant CAD.

Statistical analysis

Patient characteristics were reported as counts, percentages or means ± SD. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate predictors of obstructive CAD. In the final multivariable model, we included the predictors with clinical significance and p < 0.05. We included interaction terms significantly improving the model by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and the Net Reclassification Improvement. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was not significant for the final model. To investigate the main contributing variables of the GRACE risk score and guidelines risk criteria, we used a forward selection logistic regression analysis, with inclusion at p < 0.05.

We found that an increasing number of variables with missing information was significantly associated with no obstructive CAD (odds ratio (OR) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 0.83). We tested this assumption for all variables included in the final model; it was found to be true for all variables except symptom characteristics. Therefore, missing information was combined in the reference group for the other variables, but classified as an independent predictive category for symptom characteristics.

We created a score based on the final multivariable model, weighting the variables with the OR rounded off to the nearest integer. Applying the score, we estimated the proportion of patients with a high negative predictive value (NPV) for prognostically significant CAD, assuming these patients could have been safely discharged without a CAG or referred for elective CAG. The discriminative performance of the GRACE risk score, the ESC and ACC/AHA guidelines risk criteria, and the derived model and its score were tested by ROC analysis. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata V.14.0. All reported differences had two-sided p values < 0.05.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

Estimation of pretest probability (PTP) is recommended to guide referral for non-invasive testing and treatment decisions in patients with symptoms suggestive of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD).

Novel risk factor-weighted and coronary artery calcium score-weighted clinical likelihood models (ie, the RF-CL and CACS-CL models, respectively) for patient-specific PTP estimation have been proposed, yielding superior discrimination of obstructive CAD compared with a currently endorsed basic PTP model. However, as patient demographics and CAD prevalences vary nationally, further external validation is warranted.

### Simplified approach to predicting obstructive coronary disease with integration of coronary calcium: development and external validation [^116aXcoZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

When evaluating patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD), physician decisions on appropriate testing and patient management rely heavily on estimations of patients' likelihood of obstructive CAD. The original Diamond‐Forrester model has been used extensively for this purpose because of its simplicity. However, the prevalence of obstructive CAD has decreased over time. As a result, the original Diamond‐Forrester model tends to overestimate prevalence of obstructive CAD.

Genders et al recently updated the Diamond‐Forrester model to better reflect contemporary patients using a cohort of 2260 patients for retraining and 454 patients for testing. The model could potentially be further informed by using coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring. CAC is a robust marker of atherosclerosis, which is highly predictive of obstructive CAD, making it an ideal component for models aimed at predicting obstructive CAD. The CAD Consortium developed a basic model (age, sex, and symptoms) and a clinical model (Cons‐Clin; age, sex, symptoms, and medical history), which were significantly improved upon by considering CAC (Cons‐CAC; clinical model and CAC) when predicting obstructive CAD. However, these models require detailed calculations that physicians would need to access online calculators to complete. In comparison, 1 of the major advantages of the original Diamond‐Forrester model was that predicted probabilities could be referenced quickly using likelihood tables posted in clinical areas for easy access.

In this study, we aimed to address this clinical need by replicating the simplicity of the original Diamond‐Forrester model by generating likelihood tables that incorporate CAC with the most pertinent patient features (age, sex, and cardiac chest pain). We derived the likelihood tables using 3 large, international populations undergoing coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). We then tested the prediction performance and calibration of the likelihood tables in a separate external population with comparisons to existing risk models.

Risk Scoring for Prediction of Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease

The Singapore‐developed LAH clinical model includes the following variables: age, sex, symptom typicality, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking status. The LAH (CACS) model adds the continuous Agatston score (CACS) to these variables. The LAH was selected as it was developed using a local cohort most similar to the current study and derived using CCTA. The CAD2 clinical and CAD2 (CACS) models use the same variables as their LAH counterparts and have previously been externally validated. The RF‐CL and CACS‐CL were selected as contemporary nonlocal comparator models to the LAH and have been shown to improve discriminatory performance of obstructive CAD at ICA compared with the CAD2. Just like the ESC‐PTP and AHA/ACC‐PTP, the CACS‐CL has been included in guidelines. The RF‐CL model uses the ESC‐AHA/ACC model of age, sex, and symptoms and further adds weightage for the number of risk factors (0–1, 2–3, or 4–5) in a logistic regression model. The CACS‐CL model additionally adds weightage for these risk factors across strata of increasing CACS (1–9, 10–99, 1–399, 400–999, ≥ 1000). AHA/ACC‐PTP and ESC‐PTP are table‐based PTP models from pooled analysis of 3 large‐scale studies (Figure 1B).

The LAH models were developed to predict the prevalence of 50% diameter stenosis at CCTA whereas the CAD2 and the CL models were originally developed to predict the prevalence of 50% diameter stenosis using invasive coronary angiography. AHA/ACC‐PTP and ESC‐PTP were based on the observed prevalence of obstructive CAD using a mixed reference standard of invasive coronary angiography and CCTA.

### External validation of novel clinical likelihood models to predict obstructive coronary artery disease and prognosis [^113dD6qT]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Estimation of pretest probability (PTP) is recommended to guide referral for non-invasive testing and treatment decisions in patients with symptoms suggestive of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Additionally, post-test probabilities following non-invasive diagnostic tests are estimated by combining PTP estimates with likelihood ratios. Hence, PTP model precision is a major concern to ensure optimal patient management.

Classically, PTP models stratify patients with de novo chest pain by sex, age and type of chest pain symptoms. Further, the incorporation of cardiovascular risk factors and coronary artery calcium score (CACS) is acknowledged to modify patient-specific clinical likelihood (CL). However, a clinically feasible and validated tool to estimate the CL of obstructive CAD was recognised as a 'gap in evidence' by the 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines on chronic coronary syndrome.

Recently, simple and clinically useful tools for patient-specific CL estimation were proposed. Validated in North-American, Danish and Chinese cohorts, the risk factor-weighted and CACS-weighted CL models (RF-CL and CACS-CL, respectively) show improved prediction and discrimination of both obstructive CAD and future cardiovascular events in patients with suspected obstructive CAD. However, as patient demographics and CAD prevalences vary nationally, further external validation is warranted to ensure general feasibility.

Thus, using the Scottish CT of the HEART (SCOT-HEART) trialand compared with the ESC-PTP model, we aimed to externally validate the RF-CL and CACS-CL models to discriminate obstructive CAD and predict prognosis.

### External validation of novel clinical likelihood models to predict obstructive coronary artery disease and prognosis [^114W1Pwq]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The risk factor-weighted and coronary artery calcium score-weighted clinical likelihood (RF-CL and CACS-CL, respectively) models improve discrimination of patients with suspected obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). However, external validation is warranted. Compared to the 2019 European Society of Cardiology pretest probability (ESC-PTP) model, the aims were (1) to validate the RF-CL and CACS-CL models for identification of obstructive CAD and revascularisation, and (2) to investigate prognosis by CL thresholds.

Methods

Stable de novo chest pain patients (n = 1585) undergoing coronary CT angiography (CTA) were investigated. Obstructive CAD was defined as > 70% diameter stenosis in a major epicardial vessel on CTA. Decision of revascularisation within 120 days was based on onsite judgement. The endpoint was non-fatal myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death. The ESC-PTP was calculated based on age, sex and symptom typicality, the RF-CL additionally included number of risk factors, and the CACS-CL incorporated CACS to the RF-CL.

Results

Obstructive CAD was present in 386/1585 (24.4%) patients, and 91/1585 (5.7%) patients underwent revascularisation. Both the RF-CL and CACS-CL classified more patients to very-low CL (< 5%) of obstructive CAD compared with the ESC-PTP model (41.4% and 52.2% vs 19.2%, p < 0.001). In very-low CL patients, obstructive CAD and revascularisation prevalences (≤ 6%and < 1%) remained similar combined with low event risk during 5.0 years follow-up.

Conclusion

In an external validation cohort, the novel RF-CL and CACS-CL models improve categorisation to a very-low CL group with preserved prevalences of obstructive CAD, revascularisation and favourable prognosis.

The evaluation of patients with chest pain begins with clinical assessment, followed by noninvasive testing and invasive coronary angiography. Clinical assessment alone can provide an estimate of the likelihood of obstructive, anatomic coronary artery disease before any testing is performed — this is an estimation of pretest probability. Diamond and Forrester1 proposed such pretest estimates in 1979, in combination with Bayes' theorem of conditional probability, and the results of noninvasive tests, to estimate the posttest likelihood of obstructive, anatomic CAD. This Viewpoint summarizes our assessment of the evidence for a temporal decline in the accuracy of Diamond-Forrester estimates, indicates which current method for ePTP is most reliable, and explains why ePTP remains clinically useful.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to evaluation of stable chest pain, low risk, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend to consider using a model to estimate pretest probability of obstructive coronary artery disease in patients with stable chest pain and no known coronary artery disease presenting to the outpatient clinic, to identify patients at low risk for obstructive coronary artery disease and favorable prognosis in whom additional diagnostic testing can be deferred.

Assessment of obstructive CAD

Obstructive CAD was defined by ICA and CT as the presence of at least one 50% coronary artery diameter stenosis on a per-patient level. As CT has a high sensitivity/specificity for the detection of significant CAD, we used CT results equally as ICA results in this study. If ICA was performed after clinically indicated CT, the ICA result was selected for the final analysis of the accuracy of PTP, since ICA is the reference standard for the diagnosis of CAD. All examinations were evaluated locally at each clinical site by qualified and trained readers for CT and cardiologists for ICA according to their local standard of care, e.g. by using quantitative coronary analysis.

Statistical analysis

Values are given as arithmetic mean (standard deviation), as median (interquartile range; IQR), or as number of patients (percentages). We performed the statistical analysis by using SPSS version 20 and R 3.4.4. A p value of ≤ 0.05 was defined to indicate statistical significance. The dependent t test for paired samples was used for the comparison of continuous variables. To compare pared dichotomous variables, we performed McNemar's test. We used the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) to compare the discriminative power of the two pre-test prediction models. To compare the two models in terms of their diagnostic accuracy, we performed a logistic regression analysis with the outcome (CAD or no CAD) as a dependent variable and the respective PTP and the method of computation as a predictor. In order to take care of the variability between sites, we applied a random intercept for site and correlation between observations. In addition, we performed a net reclassification analysis using 50% as a cutoff value for the PTP.

Results

In total, 1585 patients were available for statistical analyses. Patient demographics and CAD characteristics are outlined in table 1. Obstructive CAD was present in 386/1585 (24.4%) patients, and 91/1585 (5.7%) patients underwent revascularisation within 120 days following coronary CTA.

Calibration of the CL models

Calibration of the ESC-PTP, RF-CL and CACS-CL models against obstructive CAD on coronary CTA is shown in figure 1A. Overall, all models underestimated the probability of obstructive CAD defined by coronary CTA which was more pronounced for the RF-CL and CACS-CL models compared with the ESC-PTP model.

### External validation of novel clinical likelihood models to predict obstructive coronary artery disease and prognosis [^114KzH8p]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this large-scale external validation of the RF-CL and CACS-CL models, both models showed impaired calibration but superior discrimination against obstructive CAD on coronary CTA compared with the currently guideline-endorsed ESC-PTP model. Importantly, model calibration improved for the RF-CL and CACS-CL models against a reference standard of revascularisation. Compared with the ESC-PTP model, more patients were downclassified to a very-low CL group with preserved prevalences of obstructive CAD and revascularisation with overall favourable prognosis.

### Coronary artery calcium score and pre-test probabilities as gatekeepers to predict and rule out perfusion defects in positron emission tomography [^112gvtrS]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of mortality and the second cause of disability worldwide, with 9 million deaths and 182 million disability-adjusted life-years annually. In patients with suspected CAD, clinical prediction rules are recommended to assess the probability of obstructive CAD, such as pre-test probabilities from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (pre-test-AHA/ACC) or from the European Society of Cardiology (pre-test-ESC). Both pre-test probabilities are based on the Diamond-Forrester model with age, gender and symptoms, and were recently updated using current data form large cohorts, mainly using coronary computed tomography (CT). Depending on pre-test probability, non-invasive testing for CAD may be recommended.

Myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography (PET) is a relatively recent non-invasive test for CAD with superior diagnostic and prognostic accuracy. – PET can assess both relative and absolute myocardial perfusion, including myocardial flow reserve (MFR), which provides additional diagnostic and prognostic value.– PET was shown to be cost-effective for CAD, but it is an expensive test.

The coronary artery calcium score (CACS) is a simple and comparatively inexpensive measurement of coronary calcifications on CT.CACS is an excellent predictor of short-term and long-term adverse cardiac events and mortality. CACS can also predict myocardial ischemia on single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), but studies on prediction of PET findings are conflicting. Thus, CACS might be an effective gatekeeper to rule out obstructive CAD before advanced and expensive imaging tests. This may prove particularly advantageous, given the currently low frequency of abnormal myocardial perfusion test results.

However, using CACS as a gatekeeper is controversial and more evidence is needed. Moreover, the comparative prediction and rule out abilities of CACS vs. the recently updated pre-test-AHA/ACC and pre-test-ESC for PET perfusion defects are unknown. Therefore, the aims of this study were to compare CACS, pre-test-probabilities, and combinations of them (post-test probabilities) to predict perfusion defects in patients with suspected CAD undergoing PET, and to compare the gatekeeper performance of CACS 0, pre-test probabilities ≤ 5% and post-test probabilities ≤ 5%, according to guidelines.

### Performance of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology guideline-recommended pretest probability model for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary artery disease [^112F9dH1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Recently, a more comprehensive assessment of CAD probability based on a simple table, including sex, age, and type of symptoms, combined with the number of cardiovascular risk factors was proposed and from which the risk factor–weighted clinical likelihood (RF‐CL) model was derived (Figure 1). In a large international validation cohort (n = 15 411), the RF‐CL enabled optimized reclassification of patients and improved prediction and discrimination of obstructive CAD compared with the ESC‐PTP model.

In the new 2021 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC)/ASE/CHEST/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR Guideline for the Evaluation and Diagnosis of Chest Pain (AHA/ACC‐PTP) (Figure 1), categorization of the symptom typicality was not included in the PTP estimation. The justification for this exclusion was that not only chest pain should be considered angina equivalents, but also pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue. Furthermore, this exclusion was meant to reduce the confusion on the terminology of atypical angina. Correspondingly, the 2021 guideline provides only sex‐ and age‐stratified "maximal" PTP estimations for patients with chest pain but does not provide any supportive data for the PTP estimations based on nonclassic symptoms as well as presence or absence of risk factors. The guideline includes a visual graph to downgrade PTP based on symptoms, but no specific guidance or data are provided.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether categorization of angina typicality and risk factor assessment improve stratification of patients according to their observed prevalence of disease in a contemporary cohort of patients with suspected obstructive CAD. Second, we studied the clinical consequences of applying the simplified AHA/ACC‐PTP model compared with the ESC‐PTP and the RF‐CL models.

Conclusions

We have developed and externally validated simple likelihood tables incorporating CAC, age, sex, and cardiac chest pain in symptomatic patients, which had higher prediction performance for obstructive CAD compared with the updated Diamond‐Forrester and CAD Consortium clinical and CAC models.

### Clinical pre-test probability for obstructive coronary artery disease: insights from the European DISCHARGE pilot study [^117Jo4ht]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of obstructive CAD identified by ICA and CT (31.7%, 456 of 1440 patients) was overestimated by both prediction models (PTP: initial D+F 58.9% (28.1–90.6%) and updated D+F 47.3% (34.2–59.9%), both p < 0.001; Fig. 3). Comparison of both prediction models showed overestimation of CAD to be slightly less for the updated D+F compared with the initial version (p < 0.001). The PTP calculated with the initial D+F version was 51% in the CT group (median 54.4% (18.6–79.4%)) versus 65% in the ICA group (median 69.7% (32.4–92%)). In both groups, the PTP of CAD was significantly lower when calculated with the updated D+F version: 43% in the CT group (median 41.4% (29.8–53.2%)) and 53% in the ICA group (median 51.8% (40.6–65.4%)). Thus, both pre-test calculators overestimated the actual prevalence of obstructive CAD of 45% in the ICA group and 19% in the CT group (p < 0.001). The overestimation was higher for the initial D+F calculation compared with the updated D+F version in both the CT and the ICA group (p < 0.001) and was higher in the CT group compared with that in the ICA group (p < 0.001) for both prediction models.

### Simplified approach to predicting obstructive coronary disease with integration of coronary calcium: development and external validation [^115EEpDQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The Diamond-Forrester model was used extensively to predict obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) but overestimates probability in current populations. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a useful marker of CAD, which is not routinely integrated with other features. We derived simple likelihood tables, integrating CAC with age, sex, and cardiac chest pain to predict obstructive CAD.

Methods and Results

The training population included patients from 3 multinational sites (n = 2055), with 2 sites for external testing (n = 3321). We determined associations between age, sex, cardiac chest pain, and CAC with the presence of obstructive CAD, defined as any stenosis ≥ 50% on coronary computed tomography angiography. Prediction performance was assessed using area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and compared with the CAD Consortium models with and without CAC, which require detailed calculations, and the updated Diamond-Forrester model. In external testing, the proposed likelihood tables had higher AUC (0.875 [95% CI, 0.862–0.889]) than the CAD Consortium clinical+CAC score (AUC, 0.868 [95% CI, 0.855–0.881]; P = 0.030) and the updated Diamond-Forrester model (AUC, 0.679 [95% CI, 0.658–0.699]; P < 0.001). The calibration for the likelihood tables was better than the CAD Consortium model (Brier score, 0.116 versus 0.121; P = 0.005).

Conclusions

We have developed and externally validated simple likelihood tables to integrate CAC with age, sex, and cardiac chest pain, demonstrating improved prediction performance compared with other risk models. Our tool affords physicians with the opportunity to rapidly and easily integrate a small number of important features to estimate a patient's likelihood of obstructive CAD as an aid to clinical management.

### Machine learning of clinical variables and coronary artery calcium scoring for the prediction of obstructive coronary artery disease on coronary computed tomography angiography: analysis from the CONFIRM registry [^111Bg8RL]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Symptom-based pretest probability scores that estimate the likelihood of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in stable chest pain have moderate accuracy. We sought to develop a machine learning (ML) model, utilizing clinical factors and the coronary artery calcium score (CACS), to predict the presence of obstructive CAD on coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA).

Methods and Results

The study screened 35 281 participants enrolled in the CONFIRM registry, who underwent ≥ 64 detector row CCTA evaluation because of either suspected or previously established CAD. A boosted ensemble algorithm (XGBoost) was used, with data split into a training set (80%) on which 10-fold cross-validation was done and a test set (20%). Performance was assessed of the (1) ML model (using 25 clinical and demographic features), (2) ML + CACS, (3) CAD consortium clinical score, (4) CAD consortium clinical score + CACS, and (5) updated Diamond-Forrester (UDF) score. The study population comprised of 13 054 patients, of whom 2380 (18.2%) had obstructive CAD (≥ 50% stenosis). Machine learning with CACS produced the best performance [area under the curve (AUC) of 0.881] compared with ML alone (AUC of 0.773), CAD consortium clinical score (AUC of 0.734), and with CACS (AUC of 0.866) and UDF (AUC of 0.682), P < 0.05 for all comparisons. CACS, age, and gender were the highest ranking features.

Conclusion

A ML model incorporating clinical features in addition to CACS can accurately estimate the pretest likelihood of obstructive CAD on CCTA. In clinical practice, the utilization of such an approach could improve risk stratification and help guide downstream management.

### Prediction model to estimate presence of coronary artery disease: retrospective pooled analysis of existing cohorts [^115TAcBL]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To develop prediction models that better estimate the pretest probability of coronary artery disease in low prevalence populations.

Design

Retrospective pooled analysis of individual patient data.

Setting

18 hospitals in Europe and the United States.

Participants

Patients with stable chest pain without evidence for previous coronary artery disease, if they were referred for computed tomography (CT) based coronary angiography or catheter based coronary angiography (indicated as low and high prevalence settings, respectively).

Main Outcome Measures

Obstructive coronary artery disease (≥ 50% diameter stenosis in at least one vessel found on catheter based coronary angiography). Multiple imputation accounted for missing predictors and outcomes, exploiting strong correlation between the two angiography procedures. Predictive models included a basic model (age, sex, symptoms, and setting), clinical model (basic model factors and diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and smoking), and extended model (clinical model factors and use of the CT based coronary calcium score). We assessed discrimination (c statistic), calibration, and continuous net reclassification improvement by cross validation for the four largest low prevalence datasets separately and the smaller remaining low prevalence datasets combined.

Results

We included 5677 patients (3283 men, 2394 women), of whom 1634 had obstructive coronary artery disease found on catheter based coronary angiography. All potential predictors were significantly associated with the presence of disease in univariable and multivariable analyses. The clinical model improved the prediction, compared with the basic model (cross validated c statistic improvement from 0.77 to 0.79, net reclassification improvement 35%); the coronary calcium score in the extended model was a major predictor (0.79 to 0.88, 102%). Calibration for low prevalence datasets was satisfactory.

Conclusions

Updated prediction models including age, sex, symptoms, and cardiovascular risk factors allow for accurate estimation of the pretest probability of coronary artery disease in low prevalence populations. Addition of coronary calcium scores to the prediction models improves the estimates.

Validation

We assessed the validity of the clinical model in a cross validation procedure. The four largest low prevalence databases with sufficient numbers for reliable validation, and the remaining low prevalence databases combined, were each in turn removed from the model development sample. We then validated each model using the database that was omitted during model development. We calculated the c statistic and validated the model according to the steps in the box (the web appendix provides more detail).

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2022). High credibility.

Epidemiology — pre-test probability (PTP) models in symptomatic patients — age, gender, coronary risk factors, and symptom characteristics are used in clinical practice to estimate the probability of CAD and risk for cardiac events and to identify patients who may benefit from non-invasive testing. The European and American guidelines recommend the Duke clinical score and the revised Diamond and Forrester models as preferred clinical tools to calculate PTP of obstructive CAD in symptomatic patients without known coronary syndromes. While other scores have been proposed for various CAD scenarios, it is important to estimate the PTP using any of these clinical scores to optimize cost/benefit and to reduce false results in individual patients.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to risk assessment (obstructive CAD), ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain additional clinical data (such as examination of peripheral arteries, resting ECG, resting echocardiography, and presence of vascular calcifications on previously performed imaging tests) to adjust the estimate yielded by the Risk Factor-weighted Clinical Likelihood model.

### Performance of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology guideline-recommended pretest probability model for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary artery disease [^112NnwsW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

To date, it is unknown what is the optimal PTP cutoff value to defer testing, because no studies have investigated this according to symptom relief, quality of life, or prognosis. The cutoff recommended for deferring testing is 5% in the ESC guidelines, and testing with PTP of 5% to 15% could be considered on the basis of individual assessment. In the AHA/ACC guideline, testing was recommended in patients with PTP > 15% and can be considered with PTP ≤ 15% based on clinical judgment. Interestingly, the mean observed prevalence of disease was 14.9% in the data from which the PTP was estimated.

Using the AHA/ACC‐PTP, only 5% of patients would be allocated to the very low probability category (PTP ≤ 5%), 31% of patients are in the gray zone (PTP 5%–15%), and 65% are categorized as PTP > 15% based on the maximum values in the table before downgrading. In contrast, using the RF‐CL model, 49% of patients would be categorized to a likelihood ≤ 5%, 35% of patients are in the gray zone between 5‐15% and only 16% of patients to a likelihood > 15%. Hence, the RF‐CL model categorized clearly fewer patients to the intermediate‐high PTP in which testing is recommended and more patients into the very low PTP in which testing is not recommended. As the goal of the AHA/ACC guideline was to avoid unnecessary testing, the findings of the present analysis emphasize that clinicians should downgrade the AHA/ACC‐PTP maximum values.

In addition to the RF‐CL model, we have also suggested a PTP model that includes the coronary artery calcium score. The simple coronary artery calcium score clinical likelihood graphical tool has showed superiority to both ESC‐PTP and use of coronary calcium alone, therefore further improving the classification and increasing the number of patients with very low PTP. Part of these data was also adopted into the 2021 AHA/ACC guidelines on chest pain. However, in which patients coronary artery calcium score testing is most beneficial for clinical decision‐making is still unknown. In addition, whether inclusion of factors, such as genetic risk variants, circulating biomarkers, or other simple tests, can increase performance of clinical likelihood models needs further investigation.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Stable chest pain in patients with no known coronary artery disease (CAD) — stable chest pain is a symptom of myocardial ischemia characterized by chest pain that is provoked with stress, and risk status in suspected stable ischemic heart disease is not well defined. In symptomatic patients with suspected CAD, use of validated scores to predict the pretest probability of obstructive CAD may be useful to identify low-risk patients for whom testing may be deferred, and it is preferable to use contemporary estimates from the past 10 years in preference to historic series, which may overestimate the frequency of obstructive CAD. Alternatively, low-risk patients may be those < 40 years of age or who have symptoms with a low likelihood of representing ischemia, and when available, information on the presence and amount of coronary artery calcium may be useful for enhancing the pretest probability of obstructive CAD.
