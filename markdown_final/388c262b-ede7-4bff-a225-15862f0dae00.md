## Question

Mpl mutation

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about MPL mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms, including their molecular basis, diagnostic role, clinical correlations, testing strategies, and prognostic implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the gene and its normal function. Then, I should verify the specific MPL mutations and their frequency across MPN subtypes. Next, I will examine the pathogenic mechanism and how MPL mutations fit into diagnostic algorithms. After that, I should review clinical phenotype and outcomes, including thrombotic risk and fibrotic progression. Finally, I will consider testing methodologies, reporting standards, and prognostic integration with high-molecular-risk mutations, and close with practical takeaways and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the gene and its physiologic role. MPL encodes the thrombopoietin receptor on chromosome 1p34, which binds thrombopoietin to regulate megakaryocyte development, platelet production, and hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis, so activating mutations would be expected to drive thrombocytosis and altered stem cell dynamics [^1138y5YV].

> I need to check the specific mutations and their distribution. The canonical somatic mutations cluster in exon 10 at codon 515, most commonly W515L and W515K, with less frequent W515A/R. S505N is classically linked to familial autosomal dominant thrombocytosis, and rare variants outside exon 10 such as Y252H and V501A have been reported, though their pathogenic significance is variable and often uncertain without functional data [^1145SDqc] [^1167mxwn] [^112Gpqeg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about frequency without anchoring to disease context. In essential thrombocythemia, MPL mutations occur in roughly 3–5% overall, and in primary myelofibrosis around 5–10%, with higher representation among JAK2 V617F–negative cases. In polycythemia vera, MPL mutations are essentially absent, so MPL testing is not indicated when PV is suspected, which I should explicitly confirm to avoid misapplication [^1167mxwn] [^1145SDqc] [^113zkfhT].

> Next, I should review the mechanism to ensure biological plausibility. MPL W515 mutations disrupt the juxtamembrane domain and confer ligand-independent receptor dimerization with constitutive JAK2/STAT signaling, thereby driving megakaryocytic proliferation and thrombocytosis; mechanistically, this aligns with the clinical phenotypes seen in MPL-mutated ET and PMF and explains why JAK inhibitors can be effective across MPL-mutant disease [^114Mrdwh] [^112Gpqeg].

> I will now examine the diagnostic role and where MPL fits in algorithms. Modern WHO/ICC and NCCN criteria treat JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutations as major diagnostic criteria for ET and PMF, but absence of these mutations does not exclude MPN, and MPL testing is typically reserved for JAK2 V617F–negative cases with suspected ET or PMF; in practice, sequential testing or a targeted NGS panel including JAK2, CALR, and MPL is acceptable, and I should double-check that this sequencing-first approach is endorsed by guidelines, which it is [^1152B3Mx] [^114P4BZP] [^1174ix3D] [^112muRia].

> Wait, let me verify the PV exception so I don't overgeneralize. MPL mutations are not described in PV, so MPL testing should not be ordered when PV is the leading consideration; instead, if PV is suspected and JAK2 V617F is negative, reflex testing for JAK2 exon 12 mutations is appropriate, which I should emphasize to prevent diagnostic delays [^113zkfhT] [^114VEiyS].

> Let me consider clinical phenotype and outcomes in MPL-mutated ET. Compared with JAK2 V617F–positive ET, MPL-mutated ET tends to present in older patients with lower hemoglobin, higher platelet counts, and more microvascular symptoms; importantly, some series suggest higher fibrotic progression rates than JAK2-mutated ET, raising concern that a subset may represent prefibrotic PMF rather than true ET, which has direct implications for prognosis and management [^1137VkCt] [^1111S37G].

> I should confirm prognostic signals in PMF. MPL-mutated PMF is associated with lower hemoglobin at diagnosis and higher transfusion dependence; in terms of survival, MPL mutations generally confer intermediate prognosis compared with the favorable CALR type 1 group and the adverse triple-negative category, reinforcing the need to integrate driver status with clinical scoring and additional mutations when counseling patients [^117BqWu1] [^116ifNJK].

> But wait, what about thrombotic risk and how MPL compares with JAK2 and CALR. JAK2 V617F consistently associates with higher thrombotic risk in ET, whereas data for MPL are less uniform; some studies suggest increased arterial thrombosis in MPL-mutated ET, but others find no independent prognostic significance for thrombosis, so I should be cautious and frame MPL thrombotic risk as possible but not definitive compared with the robust JAK2 signal [^114gS6Q8] [^111yb3nN].

> Next, I should review testing methodologies and sensitivity. Allele-specific qPCR is the most sensitive clinical approach for W515 hotspots, with detection down to about 0.1–1%, whereas Sanger sequencing has lower sensitivity around 5–20% and risks false negatives. NGS panels can comprehensively survey MPL exon 10 and detect rare or compound variants, but allele frequency estimation requires adequate depth and careful validation, so I need to ensure the lab's assay performance is documented [^114rxvUs].

> Hold on, I should verify reporting standards so results are clinically interpretable. Reports should state the exact variant using HGVS nomenclature, provide qualitative and, when available, quantitative allele burden, and include assay sensitivity and methodology; for JAK2 V617F, standardized reporting templates exist and similar principles apply to MPL, with explicit mention of specimen type and clinical indication to support diagnostic integration [^112pZKxL] [^116Sk1xr] [^116w1STy].

> I need to ensure we address the broader genomic context. Beyond canonical drivers, high-molecular-risk mutations such as ASXL1, EZH2, SRSF2, U2AF1, and IDH1/2 independently worsen survival and leukemia-free survival in PMF and influence management. Integrating these with driver status yields substantially better prognostication than clinical variables alone, and I should confirm that contemporary models and calculators reflect this, which they do [^1139DqPV] [^111WNym2] [^115kisia].

> Let me reconsider the practical algorithm so it is actionable. For suspected ET or PMF, test JAK2 V617F first. If negative, test CALR and MPL, or use a targeted NGS panel up front. For suspected PV, prioritize JAK2 V617F and, if negative with supportive labs, reflex to JAK2 exon 12. Once an MPN is confirmed, perform NGS-based mutational profiling to define high-molecular-risk lesions and refine prognosis, aligning with NCCN and contemporary practice [^114P4BZP] [^1174ix3D].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied MPL mutations are mutually exclusive with JAK2, but I should correct that. While driver mutations are generally mutually exclusive, rare co-occurrence of low-burden JAK2 V617F with CALR or MPL has been described, so discordant or unexpected results warrant careful review of allele frequencies and potential compound clones before final interpretation [^115qtqPH] [^1145SDqc].

> In summary, MPL W515 mutations are infrequent but pathogenic drivers of ET and PMF that activate MPL-JAK2-STAT signaling. Diagnostically, they support ET/PMF in the right clinical context but are not useful for PV. Clinically, MPL-mutated ET may behave more aggressively with higher fibrotic potential, and MPL-mutated PMF shows intermediate outcomes relative to CALR and triple-negative disease. Testing should be sensitive and reported with clear nomenclature and allele burden when available, and results should be integrated with comprehensive molecular profiling to capture high-molecular-risk mutations that refine prognosis and guide therapy [^1145SDqc] [^116ifNJK] [^1139DqPV].

MPL mutations are **activating variants** in the thrombopoietin receptor gene, most commonly W515L/K in exon 10, that drive **JAK-STAT signaling** and cause megakaryocytic proliferation [^1138y5YV] [^114Mrdwh]. They are found in ~3–5% of ET and ~5–10% of PMF, are rare in PV, and are mutually exclusive with JAK2/CALR in most cases [^1167mxwn] [^1145SDqc] [^113zkfhT]. MPL-mutated MPNs present with thrombocytosis, lower hemoglobin, and higher risks of thrombosis and fibrotic progression; testing for MPL is recommended in JAK2-negative ET/PMF and can be done by qPCR, NGS, or Sanger sequencing [^1137VkCt] [^1111S37G] [^114P4BZP] [^112YkEpJ]. MPL mutations are WHO major diagnostic criteria for ET/PMF and inform prognosis and therapy selection, including JAK inhibitors [^1152B3Mx] [^112hhB7e].

---

## Molecular basis and functional consequences

- **Gene and protein**: MPL encodes the thrombopoietin receptor, essential for megakaryocyte and platelet production and HSC homeostasis [^1138y5YV] [^113A3y1n].

- **Common mutations**: W515L/K in exon 10 are the most frequent; they confer ligand-independent JAK2 activation and constitutive JAK-STAT signaling [^1145SDqc] [^112Gpqeg].

- **Other variants**: Less common exon 10 changes (W515A/R, S505N) and rare non-exon 10 variants (e.g. Y252H) also activate signaling [^1145SDqc] [^112Gpqeg].

## Clinical significance and prevalence

| **Myeloproliferative neoplasm** | **Prevalence of mpl mutations** |
|-|-|
| Essential thrombocythemia (ET) | ~3–5% [^1167mxwn] [^112k81Zq] |
| Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) | ~5–10% [^113HGB4f] |
| Polycythemia vera (PV) | Rare (< 1%) [^113zkfhT] |

- **Mutual exclusivity**: MPL mutations are usually mutually exclusive with JAK2 and CALR, though rare co-occurrences exist [^113HGB4f] [^115qtqPH].

- **Clinical features**: MPL-mutated ET/PMF often shows higher platelets, lower hemoglobin, older age, female predominance, and more microvascular symptoms [^111yb3nN] [^1137VkCt].

---

## Diagnostic implications

- **WHO criteria**: MPL mutations are a major diagnostic criterion for ET and PMF, helping distinguish clonal from reactive thrombocytosis [^1152B3Mx] [^117NFzj3].

- **Testing strategy**: Test for MPL in JAK2-negative suspected ET/PMF; qPCR, NGS, or Sanger are acceptable methods [^114P4BZP] [^1134ZcNK] [^1111WWeH].

- **Triple-negative disease**: Absence of JAK2, CALR, and MPL defines triple-negative MPN, which carries worse prognosis [^117NFzj3] [^116ifNJK].

---

## Prognostic significance

- **Thrombosis risk**: MPL mutations associate with higher thrombotic risk, including arterial events, compared with CALR type 1 [^112hhB7e] [^1137VkCt].

- **Disease progression**: MPL-mutated ET has higher fibrotic transformation risk than JAK2-mutated ET [^notfound].

- **Survival**: MPL-mutated PMF has intermediate prognosis, worse than CALR but better than triple-negative disease [^116ifNJK] [^117BqWu1].

---

## Therapeutic implications

- **JAK inhibitors**: Ruxolitinib and fedratinib are effective for MPL-mutated MF, improving symptoms and spleen size [^112VHW1A].

- **Interferon-alpha**: Considered in younger or low-risk MPL-mutated ET to reduce thrombocytosis and thrombosis risk [^112FeAdk].

- **Clinical trials**: Ongoing studies target MPL/JAK-STAT signaling and combine JAK inhibitors with other agents [^112VHW1A].

---

## Current research and future directions

Current research and future directions include **next-generation sequencing** to detect rare or co-occurring mutations and define the full genomic landscape [^112usKWB] [^115kisia]. Efforts also focus on integrating MPL status with clinical and genomic data to personalize prognosis and therapy [^1139DqPV]. Studies are evaluating novel agents targeting MPL, JAK2, and downstream pathways, including combinations with JAK inhibitors [^notfound].

---

MPL mutations are key drivers of ET and PMF, with distinct clinical and prognostic features; **testing for MPL is integral** to diagnosis and risk stratification, and informs the use of JAK inhibitors and other targeted therapies [^114P4BZP] [^112hhB7e].

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm that is associated with diminished quality of life, thrombohemorrhagic complications, and transformation to myelofibrosis (MF) and acute leukemia (AML). The important recent discoveries of driver mutations, including the calreticulin gene in addition to JAK2 and MPL, have led to a greater understanding of disease pathogenesis and set the stage for the advent of more sophisticated prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies. In this paper we summarize recent studies describing the molecular basis of ET. We review the prognostic importance of establishing a 'true' ET diagnosis, as well as risk factors for the development of adverse outcomes including thrombosis, AML (2% risk at 15 years), and MF (9% risk at 15 years). Finally, we discuss the decision to initiate treatment and assess the quality of evidence supporting the use of established, available therapies as well as novel treatments. Special situations, such as pregnancy, familial ET, and extreme thrombocytosis will also be discussed.

### Pathogenesis and management of high molecular risk myeloproliferative neoplasms [^1139DqPV]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Next-generation sequencing technology has facilitated increased resolution of the mutational landscape that underpins the process of malignant transformation in humans. This is exemplified by AML, in which particular patterns of mutational co-occurrence define prognostically relevant subclasses. Somatic co-mutations of relevance in myeloid cancers, in addition to MPN-drivers, are present in approximately 50% of patients with chronic phase MPN. Of note, these studies highlight genetic subgroups associated with outcomes, independent of clinical phenotypes. The number of mutations increases with disease progression and correlates with progression to MF and accelerated/blast phase MPN. The concept and definition of high molecular risk (HMR) mutations have facilitated the use of these mutations in addition to clinical disease parameters to predict patients' outcomes and inform treatment decisions.

In this review, we outline the current hypotheses regarding how clonal evolution in MPN is thought to occur and the functional mechanisms as to how concomitant somatic mutations (i.e. mutations in genes other than the 'driver' genes, JAK2, CALR and MPL) contribute to disease progression. We discuss the definitions of HMR MPN and provide an overview as to how concomitant mutations influence the clinical management of MPN and suggest how this rapidly developing genetic risk stratification can be utilized to improve clinical outcomes.

### Laboratory practice guidelines for detecting and reporting JAK2 and MPL mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology [^112muRia]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2013). Medium credibility.

BCR-ABL1–negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) — diagnostic role and prevalence of JAK2 and MPL mutations: Laboratory tests for these mutations have become standard in assessing clinically suspected cases, and the 2008 World Health Organization classification includes JAK2 mutations as diagnostic criteria in PV and JAK2 and MPL mutations in ET and PMF. A diagnosis of PV can be made when JAK2 V617F or exon 12 mutation is detected with increased hemoglobin and low or normal erythropoietin. In ET and PMF, JAK2 V617F mutations and/or MPL exon 10 mutations are present in approximately 60% to 70% of patients. Detection of JAK2 V617F and MPL mutations in appropriate clinical settings confirms the diagnosis of ET or PMF, but absence of these mutations does not rule out disease, and because JAK2 and MPL mutations are not completely specific for MPN, their finding in isolation does not warrant a diagnosis of MPN. Patients with exon 12 mutations typically present with isolated erythrocytosis and suppressed erythropoietin, bone marrow often shows isolated erythroid proliferation with absence of prominent megakaryocyte atypia and clustering, and demonstrating exon 12 mutation is particularly helpful for ruling out reactive erythrocytosis.

### Mutations in MPNs: prognostic implications, window to biology, and impact on treatment decisions [^116DSzAt]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

The last decade has witnessed tremendous scientific advances, ushered in by the JAK2 V617F discovery, contributing to enhanced diagnostic capability and understanding of the biology of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Discovery of the calreticulin mutations filled a diagnostic gap; more recent work sheds light on its contribution to disease pathogenesis, and prognosis. Recent studies have also identified novel JAK2 and MPL mutations in patients with essential thrombocythemia and myelofibrosis (MF). Especially in MF, the driver mutational profile has prognostic implications, with additive contributions from the acquisition of additional somatic mutations. The hope is that sophisticated molecular profiling will not only aid in prognostication, but also guide selection of therapy for patients with MPNs.

### The spectrum of JAK2-positive myeloproliferative neoplasms [^1144fPEc]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

The discovery of the JAK2V617F mutation triggered an unexpected flowering of basic and clinical studies in the field of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), resulting after just a few years in an exceptional amount of new information. One important consequence of those new findings was the modification of the World Health Organization classification and diagnostic algorithms for these diseases, which is still based on the original concept developed by William Dameshek in 1951 and keeps distinct entities under the umbrella of classical Philadelphia-negative MPNs. These MPNs are essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and primary myelofibrosis. Could a new molecular classification be a better tool to manage MPN patients? Several studies have shown that essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis can be divided into distinct subtypes based on the presence of the JAK2V617F mutation. Can we now define JAK2-positive diseases to depict a distinct entity from JAK2-negative MPNs? This chapter reviews the significance of JAK2 mutation positivity in the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of MPNs.

### Decoding endothelial MPL and JAK2V617F mutation: insight into cardiovascular dysfunction in myeloproliferative neoplasms [^114Ra1sg]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2024). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

Patients with JAK2V617F-positive myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential face a significantly elevated risk of cardiovascular diseases. Endothelial cells carrying the JAK2V617F mutation have been detected in many patients with MPN. In this study, we investigated the molecular basis for the high incidence of cardiovascular complications in patients with MPN.

METHODS:

We investigated the impact of endothelial JAK2V617F mutation on cardiovascular disease development using both transgenic murine models and MPN patient–derived induced pluripotent stem cell lines.

RESULTS:

Our investigations revealed that JAK2V617F mutant endothelial cells promote cardiovascular diseases under stress, which is associated with endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and endothelial dysfunction. Importantly, we discovered that inhibiting the endothelial TPO (thrombopoietin) receptor MPL (myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene) suppressed JAK2V617F-induced endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and prevented cardiovascular dysfunction caused by mutant endothelial cells. Notably, the endothelial MPL receptor is not essential for the normal physiological regulation of blood cell counts and cardiac function.

CONCLUSIONS:

JAK2V617F mutant endothelial cells play a critical role in the development of cardiovascular diseases in JAK2V617F-positive MPNs, and endothelial MPL could be a promising therapeutic target for preventing or ameliorating cardiovascular complications in these patients.

Polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are myeloproliferative neoplasms characterized by recurrent somatic mutations in JAK2, CALR, and MPL. This short review addresses (1) the spectrum of mutations seen in PV, ET, and PMF, (2) the emerging genotype-phenotype correlations, (3) the current role of molecular testing in disease classification and management, and (4) several important considerations for selecting an appropriate molecular test. In our view, sequential testing algorithms and simultaneous assessment of multiple mutations by next-generation sequencing are both valid approaches to testing. Am. J.

### Classification of myeloproliferative neoplasms and prognostic factors… [^114KyAcd]. ASCO (2012). Low credibility.

Classification of MPNs MPNs are clonal stem cell neoplasms found to share some relevant biologic features. Recent molecular advances have demonstrated that the abnormal myeloproliferation arises from constitutively active signal transduction pathways, caused by specific mutations affecting protein tyrosine kinases or related molecules. Current classification of MPNs is based on the WHO criteria established in the 2008 revision, which, besides simple clinical parameters, convey two novelties: molecular genetics and histopathology. JAK2 V617Fmutation is found in more than 95% of patients with PV and in nearly 50% to 60% of those with ET and PMF. It has also been found in other MPNs but not in nonmyeloid malignancies or in cases of secondary polycythemia. 2Exon 12 mutations of JAK2should be screened in case of JAK2 V617F-negative erythrocytosis with low erythropoietin level.

A small portion of patients with ET and PMF who lack a mutated JAK2may have activating mutations in MPL. For the time being, the study of JAK2and MPLmutations is to be included in the diagnostic workup of MPN, while all other less prevalent mutations cannot enter into the diagnostic process.
2. Concerning less frequent mutations described so far in MF, studies reported that mutations involving TET2 and MPL genes seem not to affect survival, while IDH1 implies a worse survival and higher risk of AML, as does EZH2mutations.

24–27Nullizygosity for the JAK246/1 haplotype was associated with shortened survival, raising the possibility that non-46/1 haplotypes are associated with a biologically more aggressive phenotype. 28.

### Rethinking disease definitions and therapeutic strategies in essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera [^112FeAdk]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

The seminal discovery of the JAK2V617F mutation, which is highly prevalent in Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative disorders, now renamed neoplasms, triggered an almost unprecedented explosion of interest and data in the field. Descriptions of additional mutations in exon 12 of JAK2, at position 515 in MPL, and a number of other mutations at low frequency followed these discoveries. These advances in our understanding of molecular pathogenesis of these conditions coincided with the publication of results from two major clinical studies, ECLAP and PT-1, which contributed important clinical insights and facilitated significant correlative data collection. This article, focusing mainly upon essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera, reviews four major themes: the impact upon classification of these disorders considering a radical review of current terminology, and then three areas pertinent to clinical management: the indications for cytoreductive therapy in which the key targets are to reduce thrombohemorrhagic complications, relieve disease-related symptoms, and minimize the risk of transformation to secondary myeloid malignancy such as myelodysplasia, leukemia, and secondary myelofibrosis; and second reviewing current and, last, future therapeutic options, in particular interferon and JAK2 inhibitors.

### Laboratory practice guidelines for detecting and reporting JAK2 and MPL mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology [^115BF2TF]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2013). Medium credibility.

JAK2 and MPL mutations in BCR-ABL1–negative myeloproliferative neoplasms — recurrent mutations are genetic hallmarks and detection has been incorporated into routine diagnostic algorithms; this Special Article summarizes results from a nationwide laboratory survey and provides recommendations and guidelines for laboratory practice, including clinical manifestations for prompting mutation analysis, current and recommended methodologies for testing, and standardization for reporting results. Context includes the 2005 description of a point mutation in codon 617 (JAK2 V617F) in BCR-ABL1–negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), where the mutation was found in the vast majority of polycythemia vera (PV) and in approximately half of essential thrombocythemia (ET) or primary myelofibrosis (PMF); in 2007, additional exon 12 JAK2 mutations were found in a small percentage of PV, and the exon 12 mutations and V617F are mutually exclusive, with the article also pointing to future directions for genomic testing in BCR-ABL1–negative MPN.

### Mutational analysis in BCR-ABL-negative classic myeloproliferative neoplasms: impact on prognosis and therapeutic choices [^113ZjrkD]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2010). Low credibility.

The diagnostic value of JAK2 mutational analysis in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) is now well established and endorsed by the World Health Organization classification system for hematologic malignancies. The current review is focused on the prognostic impact and therapeutic relevance of JAK2 and other MPN-associated mutations in polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Mutations involving JAK2, MPL, TET2, and ASXL1 are discussed. In general, within a specific disease category, the mere presence or absence of any one of these mutations does not appear to correlate with survival or development of blast phase disease, myelofibrosis, or thrombosis. In contrast, interesting associations between JAK2V617F allele burden and clinical outcome (e.g. lower quartile range allele burden and shorter survival in PMF and higher allele burden and fibrotic transformation in PV) have been made, but require further validation, and their impact on treatment choices is not clear. Similarly, although detection of JAK2V617F status post allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant indicates minimal residual disease, the general use of mutant allele burden for monitoring treatment response has not been systematically studied. Current information on mutational status and response to JAK2 inhibitor drug therapy is too preliminary to draw any conclusions.

Myelofibrosis — prognostic associations of CALR, JAK2 V617F, MPL, and triple-negative status: Mutations in CALR are associated with better overall survival (OS) than the JAK2 V617F or MPL W515 mutations, with the survival advantage more pronounced in type 1/type 1-like cases. In a study of 617 patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), median OS was 18 years for those with CALR mutations versus 9 years for those with JAK2 V617F or MPL mutation and 3 years for patients with triple-negative MF. CALR mutations retained prognostic significance for better OS compared to JAK2 V617F (P = 0.019) and to triple-negative status (P < .001) in a multivariate analysis corrected for age. The 10-year cumulative incidence of leukemic transformation was lower at 9% for CALR mutation compared with 19% for JAK2 V617F mutation.

### Murine modeling of myeloproliferative neoplasms [^114dagks]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms, such as polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis, are bone marrow disorders that result in the overproduction of mature clonal myeloid elements. Identification of recurrent genetic mutations has been described and aid in diagnosis and prognostic determination. Mouse models of these mutations have confirmed the biologic significance of these mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasm disease biology and provided greater insights on the pathways that are dysregulated with each mutation. The models are useful tools that have led to preclinical testing and provided data as validation for future myeloproliferative neoplasm clinical trials.

### Classification and personalized prognosis in myeloproliferative neoplasms [^115kisia]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Myeloproliferative neoplasms, such as polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and myelofibrosis, are chronic hematologic cancers with varied progression rates. The genomic characterization of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms offers the potential for personalized diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment.

Methods

We sequenced coding exons from 69 myeloid cancer genes in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, comprehensively annotating driver mutations and copy-number changes. We developed a genomic classification for myeloproliferative neoplasms and multistage prognostic models for predicting outcomes in individual patients. Classification and prognostic models were validated in an external cohort.

Results

A total of 2035 patients were included in the analysis. A total of 33 genes had driver mutations in at least 5 patients, with mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL being the sole abnormality in 45% of the patients. The numbers of driver mutations increased with age and advanced disease. Driver mutations, germline polymorphisms, and demographic variables independently predicted whether patients received a diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia as compared with polycythemia vera or a diagnosis of chronic-phase disease as compared with myelofibrosis. We defined eight genomic subgroups that showed distinct clinical phenotypes, including blood counts, risk of leukemic transformation, and event-free survival. Integrating 63 clinical and genomic variables, we created prognostic models capable of generating personally tailored predictions of clinical outcomes in patients with chronic-phase myeloproliferative neoplasms and myelofibrosis. The predicted and observed outcomes correlated well in internal cross-validation of a training cohort and in an independent external cohort. Even within individual categories of existing prognostic schemas, our models substantially improved predictive accuracy.

Conclusions

Comprehensive genomic characterization identified distinct genetic subgroups and provided a classification of myeloproliferative neoplasms on the basis of causal biologic mechanisms. Integration of genomic data with clinical variables enabled the personalized predictions of patients' outcomes and may support the treatment of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.

### Genetic complexity of myeloproliferative neoplasms [^115Q4Uru]. Leukemia (2008). Low credibility.

Oncogenic mutations in JAK2 and MPL genes have recently been identified in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). In addition to these mutations, cytogenetic aberrations are frequently present at diagnosis but their role in the pathogenesis remains unclear. Two models of MPN pathogenesis have recently emerged based on either a single-hit or a multi-hit concept. The first model proposes that the acquisition of JAK2 mutations is the disease-initiating event, causing both the onset of disease phenotype and establishment of clonal hematopoiesis. The second model postulates the existence of 'pre-JAK2' mutations that establish clonal hematopoiesis before acquisition of JAK2 mutations and onset of disease phenotype. In this review, the two models have been critically evaluated in the context of the latest findings. At present, neither of the two models can be universally applied to all MPN patients due to their genetic heterogeneity. It is likely that the disease pathogenesis in some patients follows the first, and in other patients, the second model. Thus, the somatic mutations in MPN do not seem to be acquired in a predetermined order as seen in other malignancies, but occur randomly. Furthermore, the role of uniparental disomy in MPN and certain aspects of MPN therapy are discussed.

### Molecular mechanisms associated with leukemic transformation of MPL-mutant myeloproliferative neoplasms [^111981yj]. Haematologica (2010). Low credibility.

Somatic activating mutations in MPL, the thrombopoietin receptor, occur in the myeloproliferative neoplasms, although virtually nothing is known about their role in evolution to acute myeloid leukemia. In this study, the MPL T487A mutation, identified in de novo acute myeloid leukemia, was not detected in 172 patients with a myeloproliferative neoplasm. In patients with a prior MPL W515L-mutant myeloproliferative neoplasm, leukemic transformation was accompanied by MPL-mutant leukemic blasts, was seen in the absence of prior cytoreductive therapy and often involved loss of wild-type MPL by mitotic recombination. Moreover, clonal analysis of progenitor colonies at the time of leukemic transformation revealed the presence of multiple genetically distinct but phylogenetically-related clones bearing different TP53 mutations, implying a mutator-phenotype and indicating that leukemic transformation may be preceded by the parallel expansion of diverse hematopoietic clones.

Test validation and proficiency testing for JAK2 and MPL — The approach to validation differs between qualitative and quantitative assays; for qualitative assays, "the sensitivity must be defined", and for qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) "the threshold for a positive result must be determined" because of cross‑amplification; "A series of normal DNA samples should be analyzed to derive the threshold for a positive result", and because allele burden varies, samples "with a low allelic frequency should be included"; additionally, "A low-positive control should be included in each run", although "It may be difficult to accumulate JAK2 exon 12 or MPL mutant cases for validation"; "Proficiency testing for JAK2 V617F is now standard", "A proficiency test for JAK2 V617F is available from the College of American Pathologists", and it is likely that "MPL codon 515 mutations will be added in the future"; "Currently, testing is based only on qualitative results, but the accuracy and sensitivity of quantitative assays may be assessed in future iterations".

### Can molecular patterns help to classify overlapping entities in myeloid neoplasms? [^113HGB4f]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Molecular patterns in patients presenting with cytoses: overlap between BCR::ABL1 ‐negative MPN

Myeloproliferative neoplasms typically present with an increased number of mature white blood cells, erythrocytes and/or platelets. While CML is genetically clearly defined by the underlying BCR::ABL1 fusion gene, the classical BCR::ABL1 ‐negative MPN polycythaemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythaemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are characterised by activating somatic mutation in the JAK/STAT pathway. The JAK2 p.V617F mutation is found in > 95% of patients with PV and 50–60% of patients with ET or PMF. The vast majority of the remaining JAK2 p.V617F‐negative PV patients typically show other activating mutations in exon 12 of JAK2 associated with a more isolated erythrocytosis. Activating somatic mutations in the thrombopoietin receptor gene, MPL, are found in 5–10% of patients with ET and PMF. CALR mutations — acting as a rogue cytokine, activating MPL — are found in 25–35% of patients with ET and PMF.ET and PMF patients lacking hot‐spot mutations in JAK2, MPL and CALR are referred to as triple‐negative MPN. While the MPN driver mutations have initially been considered mutually exclusive, cases with concomitant mutations in two of these genes have been described, some even in conjunction with BCR::ABL1. This further underscores the value of molecular genetics and the need for molecular/genetic profiling, especially at the onset of unclear clinicopathological features, in view of the direct implications for treatment and follow‐up monitoring of the patient.

### Novel drivers and modifiers of MPL-dependent oncogenic transformation identified by deep mutational scanning [^112Gpqeg]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

The single transmembrane domain (TMD) of the human thrombopoietin receptor (TpoR/myeloproliferative leukemia [MPL] protein), encoded by exon 10 of the MPL gene, is a hotspot for somatic mutations associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Approximately 6% and 14% of JAK2 V617F- essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis patients, respectively, have "canonical" MPL exon 10 driver mutations W515L/K/R/A or S505N, which generate constitutively active receptors and consequent loss of Tpo dependence. Other "noncanonical" MPL exon 10 mutations have also been identified in patients, both alone and in combination with canonical mutations, but, in almost all cases, their functional consequences and relevance to disease are unknown. Here, we used a deep mutational scanning approach to evaluate all possible single amino acid substitutions in the human TpoR TMD for their ability to confer cytokine-independent growth in Ba/F3 cells. We identified all currently recognized driver mutations and 7 novel mutations that cause constitutive TpoR activation, and a much larger number of second-site mutations that enhance S505N-driven activation. We found examples of both of these categories in published and previously unpublished MPL exon 10 sequencing data from MPN patients, demonstrating that some, if not all, of the new mutations reported here represent likely drivers or modifiers of myeloproliferative disease.

JAK2 V617F and MPL assay standards and controls — If a quantitative assay is clinically indicated, there is a need for quantitative standards to accurately quantify allele burden and assess assay sensitivity and dynamic range; AML cell lines positive for JAK2 V617F include HEL, MB-02, MUTZ-8, SET-2, and UKE-1, but all except SET-2 are homozygous mutant and some (for example, HEL) have more than two copies of JAK2, making them not ideal as standards; quantitative controls for the JAK2 V617F mutation are commercially available to serve as a quantitative or low-positive control, whereas positive controls for MPL mutations are more difficult to obtain; as reference standards for quantitative JAK2 testing are made available, comparable results across laboratories can be achieved in monitoring treatment response and minimal residual disease.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms — molecular testing should include blood or bone marrow testing for JAK2 V617F; if negative, test for CALR and MPL in essential thrombocythemia (ET) and myelofibrosis (MF) and JAK2 exon 12 in polycythemia vera (PV), or use a multigene next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel including JAK2, CALR, and MPL; once an MPN diagnosis is confirmed, NGS is recommended for mutational prognostication. Prognostic models incorporating other mutations have been proposed to identify patients with MF as well as PV and ET to better estimate overall survival (OS), MF-free survival (PV and ET), and rates of leukemic transformation, and NGS may be useful to establish clonality in selected circumstances such as triple-negative non-mutated JAK2, MPL, and CALR.

### The 2016 WHO classification and diagnostic criteria for myeloproliferative neoplasms: document summary and in-depth discussion [^117NFzj3]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The complementary role of mutation screening and its limitations for diagnostic purposes

The 2008 WHO classification of MPN was largely inspired by the discovery of mutations in JAK2 (chr. 9p24), namely V617F – in exon 14 and indels in exon 12, and MPL (chr. 1p34), mainly at codon W515, that were incorporated as major diagnostic criteria. The JAK2 V617F is the most prevalent mutation in MPN, accounting for ~ 95% of PV and 60% of ET and PMF. Variable deletions and insertions clustering at codon 537–543 in exon 12 of JAK2 are detected in ~ 3–5% of patients with JAK2 V617F unmutated PV by using sensitive approaches, as mutation allelic burden in whole blood and purified granulocytes is low. Mutations in MPL cluster in exon 10 at codon 515, the most prevalent being a W to K, L, A, R transversion, and rarely at codon 505 (S > N), originally reported in familial cases of thrombocytosis. They are found in ET and PMF with approximate incidence of 4 and 8%. Finally, in 2013, mutations in CALR (chr. 19p13.2), the gene encoding the endoplasmic reticulum-associated chaperone calreticulin, were detected in patients with JAK2/MPL unmutated ET and PMF. These are highly heterogeneous indels, all clustering in exon 9 that encodes for the C-terminus portion of the protein. There are two prevalent (> 80% of all CALR variants) mutation types, type 1 (a 52-bp deletion; p.L367fs*46) and type 2 (a 5-bp insertion; p.K385fs*47), whereas the remaining are defined as type 1-like and type 2-like based on predicted helix propensity similarities with the former. The type 2 CALR mutations are preferentially associated with ET, whereas type 1 predominates in PMF. The above three driver mutations are listed as major criteria for PV (JAK2 V617F and exon 12), ET, and PMF (JAK2 V617F, CALR and MPL) in the revised 2016 classification. Therefore, the modern diagnostic approach to MPN requires the knowledge of mutation status. However, in the instances when genotyping for these mutations is not available, or the mutations result absent in diagnostic samples, minor criteria in the WHO classification are included to support diagnosis otherwise. Some PV patients who lack JAK2 mutations might eventually harbor other mutations in JAK2 or other genes such as SH2B3/LNK. On the other hand, up to 20% of ET and 10–15% of PMF patients have no driver mutations, and are currently referred as "triple-negative" (TN); some of these case have non-canonical mutations in MPL and JAK2, but overall they do not account for > 10% of the TN category. For triple-negative PMF patients, the 2016 WHO classification supports the search for other non-driver "most frequent" mutations, e.g. in ASXL1, EZH2, TET2, IDH1/IDH2, SRSF2, SF3B1, that if present stand as a marker of clonality. These mutations lack both disease specificity and mutual exclusivity; however, they are found in ~ 50% of cases with PMF, and using wider amplicon panels up to 81% of the patients presented one clonal marker. Although not explicitly stated in the WHO classification, also chromosomal abnormalities might serve as marker of clonality. Presence of the above additional mutations is not currently included as criteria of clonality in cases of PV or ET lacking driver mutations, although a recent large study showed that ~ 50% of the patients had at least one such mutations. Interpretation of these genetic variants is complicated by the discovery of CHIP, "clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential", that reflects the "trending toward inevitability"age-related accumulation of mutations; however, in the context of hematologic abnormalities that characterize MPN patients, finding any of these mutations certainly is in favor of the existence of a pathologic clonal hematopoiesis.

JAK2 assay ordering and specimen type — ideally, testing for neutrophilia and thrombocytosis would follow determination of the absence of the BCR-ABL1 translocation t(9;22), yet in practice clinicians find it easier to order both the BCR-ABL1 and the JAK2 assays at the same time in screening peripheral blood; there is no difference in analytical performance using peripheral blood or bone marrow samples for JAK2 mutation testing because granulocytes constitute the predominant population in both specimens.

### Uses and abuses of JAK2 and MPL mutation tests in myeloproliferative neoplasms a paper from the 2010 william beaumont hospital symposium on molecular pathology [^116q2cRJ]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2011). Low credibility.

JAK2V617F is sufficiently prevalent in BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) to be useful as a clonal marker. JAK2V617F mutation screening is indicated for the evaluation of erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis, splanchnic vein thrombosis, and otherwise unexplained BCR-ABL1-negative granulocytosis. However, the mutation does not provide additional value in the presence of unequivocal morphologic diagnosis, and its presence does not necessarily distinguish one MPN from another or provide useful prognostic information. In general, quantitative cell-based JAK2V617F mutation assays are preferred because the additional information obtained on mutant allele burden enhances diagnostic certainty and facilitates monitoring of response to treatment. JAK2 exon 12 mutation screening is indicated only in the presence of JAK2V617F-negative erythrocytosis that is associated with a subnormal serum erythropoietin level. MPL mutations are neither frequent nor specific enough to warrant their routine use for MPN diagnosis, but they may be useful in resolving specific diagnostic problems. The practice of en bloc screening for JAK2V617F, JAK2 exon 12, and MPL mutations is scientifically irrational and economically irresponsible.

Influence of mutational heterogeneity on current clinical management of myeloproliferative neoplasms

We now discuss how molecular risk is defined clinically and how it influences the clinical management of MPN. Current clinical guidelines and consensus documentsprovide algorithms for the management of patients with MPN, separated into the clinical phenotypes of PV, ET and MF. The canonical driver mutations (JAK2, MPL and CALR) occur as a sole genetic abnormality in 45% of MPN, but more frequently co-occur with concomitant (passenger) mutations, especially in MF. Approximately 5–10% of patients with ET or MF lack a canonical driver and are termed 'triple-negative'. Patients with triple-negative MF may harbor non-driver mutations, especially within spliceosome and chromatin-modifying genes and have inferior survival compared to MF patients with a canonical driver. These 'additional' mutations (regardless of driver status) have prognostic influence and implications for response to therapy and survival. The clinical definition of HRM differs for PV, ET and MF. It derives from NGS-profiling studies of cohorts of patients, which have identified genetic mutations associated with inferior overall survival, leukemia-free survival and (for PV and ET) MF-free survival. A large study incorporating 2,035 patients (including 1,321 with ET, 356 with PV, 309 with MF and 49 with other MPN) demonstrated that mutations in chromatin-modifier genes (e.g. ASXL1, EZH2) and spliceosome genes (e.g. ZRSR2, SRSF2), defined a genomic subgroup with inferior prognosis. In this cohort, 63 clinical and genomic variables were identified as significant for prognosis and integrated to design a prognostic model. This model is directly accessible via an online calculator (https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/mpn-multistage/), facilitating 'personalized' predictions of prognosis for individuals and has been approved as a medical device within the United Kingdom (https://blood.predict.nhs.uk/). Studies such as this highlight the heterogeneous landscape of concomitant mutations as well as the complexity of integration into prognostication and selection of therapeutic approaches in clinical practice.

### MPL-mutated essential thrombocythemia: a morphologic reappraisal [^1111S37G]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Our insight into the molecular basis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) took a landmark stride in 2005 with the identification of JAK2 mutations in nearly all polycythemia vera and the majority of essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) cases –. The subsequent identification of novel somatic activating mutations in myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) in 2006 provided an additional mechanistic explanation for JAK–STAT activation in MPN. Differential distribution of MPL mutations according to MPN subtype has since been discerned: MPL -mutated ET is uncommon, with a variable but typically cited incidence of less than 5% (5–9), while that of MPL -mutated PMF is at least twice as frequent. Phenotypically, older age and lower hemoglobin levels have been remarked in MPL -mutated vs unmutated ET cohorts. Further, MPL -mutated ET cohorts have higher reported rates of fibrotic progression than their MPL wild-type counterparts: in the order of 33.3% (vs 7.5% in MPL -unmutated) in one series. Together, these observations suggest the possibility that some instances of MPL -mutated ET might actually represent prefibrotic PMF. This distinction is not insignificant as prognosis and management may vary correspondingly. The current study was designed as a histopathological reappraisal and retrospective assessment of phenotypic and prognostic correlates in consecutive cases designated as MPL -mutated ET.

### Molecular diagnosis of the myeloproliferative neoplasms: UK guidelines for the detection of JAK2 V617F and other relevant mutations [^112YkEpJ]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Molecular genetic assays for the detection of the JAK2 V617F (c.1849G > T) and other pathogenetic mutations within JAK2 exon 12 and MPL exon 10 are part of the routine diagnostic workup for patients presenting with erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis or otherwise suspected to have a myeloproliferative neoplasm. A wide choice of techniques are available for the detection of these mutations, leading to potential difficulties for clinical laboratories in deciding upon the most appropriate assay, which can lead to problems with inter-laboratory standardization. Here, we discuss the most important issues for a clinical diagnostic laboratory in choosing a technique, particularly for detection of the JAK2 V617F mutation at diagnosis. The JAK2 V617F detection assay should be both specific and sensitive enough to detect a mutant allele burden as low as 1–3%. Indeed, the use of sensitive assays increases the detection rate of the JAK2 V617F mutation within myeloproliferative neoplasms. Given their diagnostic relevance, it is also beneficial and relatively straightforward to screen JAK2 V617F negative patients for JAK2 exon 12 mutations (in the case of erythrocytosis) or MPL exon 10 mutations (thrombocytosis or myelofibrosis) using appropriate assays. Molecular results should be considered in the context of clinical findings and other haematological or laboratory results.

JAK2 mutations

JAK2 is located on chromosome 9p24 and includes 25 exons and its protein 1132 amino acids. JAK2 is one of the four Janus family nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases; JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells, whereas JAK3 expression is limited to hematopoietic cells. Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling is important for a wide spectrum of cellular processes, including proliferation, survival or normal functioning of hematopoietic, immune, cardiac and other cells. JAKs transduce signals from their cognate type I and type II nonkinase cytokine receptors. Selective association of a JAK family member with specific cytokines or growth factors might explain some of the differences in therapeutic and side-effect profiles among drugs that primarily target JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 or multiple JAKs (Figure 2).,

JAK 2V617F

Oncogenic JAK1, JAK2 and JAK3 mutations have been associated with both lymphoid and myeloid neoplasms. Of particular relevance to MPN, JAK2 V617F was discovered in 2004and the first reports appeared in early 2005. JAK2 V617F is by far the most prevalent mutation in BCR-ABL1 -negative MPN (occurs in ∼95% of patients with PV, in ∼55% with ET and in ∼65% with PMF), but it is also seen in some patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/MPN (for example, refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis), and, rarely, in primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML), MDS or CML. However, this should not undermine its broad specificity to patients with myeloid neoplasms (including those with occult disease and splanchnic vein thrombosis), and the fact that the mutation is not seen in patients with lymphoid neoplasms, reactive myeloproliferation or in healthy volunteers.

JAK2V617F) in most patients with PV and in a subset of patients with ET and IMF. As JAK2 V617F, MPL W515L is a novel acquired mutation that induces constitutive cytokine-independent activation of the JAK-STAT pathway in MPD. The discovery of this mutation provides a novel mechanism for activation of signal transduction in hematopoietic malignancies. Methods: To investigate its prevalence in Chinese patients with MPD, we introduced allele-specific PCR combined with sequence analysis to simultaneously screen MPL W515L and JAK2 V617F mutations in 190 MPD patients. Results: The results indicated that MPLW515L mutation was found to be harbored in only one of 102 ET patients and was not detected in PV, IMF, chronic myelogenous leukemia patients. Sixty eight. BCR/ ABL-negative MPD patients were found harbouring JAK2V617F mutation.

Furthermore, MPLW515L and JAK2V617F mutations were not detected in patients of acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and CML. Conclusions: MPLW515L mutations may contribute to the primary molecular pathogenesis mechanism of Chinese patients with ET. No significant financial relationships to disclose.

### Clinical correlates of JAK2V617F presence or allele burden in myeloproliferative neoplasms: a critical reappraisal [^115Dq9MK]. Leukemia (2008). Low credibility.

JAK2 and MPL mutations are recurrent in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). A JAK2 mutation, primarily JAK2V617F, is almost invariably associated with polycythemia vera (PV). However, JAK2V617F also occurs in the majority of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) or primary myelofibrosis (PMF) as well as in a much smaller percentage of those with other MPNs. The mechanism(s) behind this one allele-multiple phenotypes phenomenon has not been fully elucidated. The issue is further confounded by the presence of marked variation in JAK2V617F allele burden among mutation-positive patients. In the current communication, we discuss potential mechanisms for phenotypic diversity among JAK2V617F-positive MPNs as well as review the current literature in regard to genotype-phenotype correlations (that is clinical correlates and prognostic significance) in the context of both the presence or absence of the mutation (ET and PMF) and its allele burden (PV, ET and PMF).

### Novel mutations and their functional and clinical relevance in myeloproliferative neoplasms: JAK2, MPL, TET2, ASXL1, CBL, IDH and IKZF1 [^111We7pm]. Leukemia (2010). Low credibility.

Despite the above-described experimental and clinical observations, JAK2 V617F does not appear to be the disease-initiating event and probably defines an MPN subclone, which does not always account for leukemic transformation. In the latter regard, JAK2 V617F-positive, as opposed to JAK2 V617F-negative, blast-phase MPN might require a fibrotic phase disease transition. On the other hand, JAK2 wild-type AML that develops in the setting of JAK2 V617F-positive MPN does not necessarily arise from originally mutation-positive clones that have undergone mitotic recombination of wild-type JAK2. The complexity of clonal hierarchy and structure in MPN has become more evident with recent demonstrations of multiple mutations occurring in the same patient and the fact that such mutations are neither necessarily mutually exclusive nor follow a predictable sequence of occurrence.

JAK2 V617F-positive MPN has been associated with older age at diagnosis (ET and PMF), higher hemoglobin level (ET and PMF), leukocytosis (ET and PMF) and lower platelet count (ET). A higher mutant allele burden has been associated with pruritus (PV and PMF), higher hemoglobin level (PV), leukocytosis (PV, ET and PMF) and larger spleen size (PV, ET and PMF). However, save for some contrary observations, the mere presence of JAK2 V617F or increased mutant allele burden does not seem to affect survival or leukemic transformation. Instead, a lower mutant allele burden has been associated with inferior survival in PMF. This particular finding illustrates prognostically relevant clonal complexity in PMF. JAK2 V617F allele burden increases with time in PV and PMF, but not in ET. This phenomenon in PV and PMF coincides with the development of post-PV myelofibrosis, marked splenomegaly and requirement for chemotherapy. Current evidence is not conclusive with regard to the relationship between JAK2 V617F and thrombosis.

To ensure that more than 90% of cases are detected, the adequate analytical sensitivity of a clinical JAK2 assay should be at least 1%; when the level falls below 1%, caution is needed because very low levels (usually < 0.1%) are described in unaffected individuals, assays that detect less than 0.1% are more likely to produce false positives, yet low levels (≤ 1%) have been reported in ET patients, and if there is doubt a later peripheral blood or bone marrow specimen may be used to confirm the finding.

### Assessing the thrombotic risk of patients with essential thrombocythemia in the genomic era [^114gS6Q8]. Leukemia (2017). Low credibility.

The molecular characterization of myeloproliferative neoplasms, including essential thrombocythemia (ET), has enabled deeper understanding of their pathogenesis. A driver lesion, namely, Janus kinase (JAK)2V617F, calreticulin (CALR) or myeloproliferative leukemia (MPL) gene mutation can be identified in the vast majority of patients. Each of these mutations is associated with distinct clinical features and may modulate the patients' clinical course, risk of complications, including vascular events, and survival. JAK2V617F appears to be a risk-modifying mutation and has been shown to increase the likelihood of thrombotic events in patients with ET across studies. As such, it has been included in prognostic models and its presence may influence treatment decisions. The association of CALR and MPL mutations with the incidence of vascular events has been less clear. Even more limited information is available on the contribution of additional non-driver lesions to the thrombotic risk. In this review we discuss the available evidence on the role of recurrent mutations in the risk of thrombotic complications in patients with ET and how these mutations weigh into modern prognostic scores.

### Analysis of molecular testing for suspected myeloproliferative neoplasm at a hybrid community-academic health system [^111SaPin]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2025). Medium credibility.

Testing for somatic mutations in JAK2, MPL, and CALR genes is critical in the diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). However, this testing may have inadvertently led to increased requests to rule out MPN, including clinical situations with low pretest probability. This article examines JAK2, MPL, and CALR testing by next-generation sequencing (NGS) with the goal of formulating practical guidelines to make test use more efficient and effective. NGS results from 1482 patients tested between 2015 and March 2022 were retrieved, along with corresponding bone marrow biopsies and complete blood cell count results performed within 90 days before NGS, and 245 cases (16.5%) were positive for pathogenic variants in JAK2, MPL, or CALR genes. The findings showed an increase in the proportion of positive cases with patient age, and a statistically significant difference in red blood cell counts and platelet counts among patients with positive versus negative results. Using these factors, simple algorithms were constructed to predict positive results with a maximum sensitivity of 91%, while potentially eliminating 28% of negative test results. However, these models still failed to identify approximately 9% of patients with MPNs. Among these missed patients, many had either primary myelofibrosis or myelodysplastic syndrome/MPN. Considering a simple triage model to help guide MPN testing could represent a more cost-effective approach, particularly if missed patients could be further reduced.

### Advances in understanding and management of myeloproliferative neoplasms [^115sY2xe]. CA (2009). Low credibility.

According to the 2008 World Health Organization classification system for hematologic malignancies, the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) include chronic myelogenous leukemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, primary myelofibrosis, mastocytosis, chronic eosinophilic leukemia-not otherwise specified, chronic neutrophilic leukemia, and "MPN, unclassifiable". All of these clinicopathologic entities are characterized by stem cell-derived clonal myeloproliferation, and their phenotypic diversity is ascribed to the occurrence of distinct oncogenic events. In the last 4 years, new JAK2 and MPL mutations have been added to previously described ABL and KIT mutations as molecular markers of disease in MPN. These discoveries have markedly simplified the approach to clinical diagnosis and have also provided molecular targets for the development of small-molecule drugs. In the current article, the authors provide a clinically oriented overview of MPNs in terms of their molecular pathogenesis, classification, diagnosis, and management.

### Cardiovascular disease in myeloproliferative neoplasms: state-of-the-art review [^11262Cjc]. JACC: CardioOncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) encompass a group of disorders of clonal hematopoiesis and include polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis. MPNs usually affect older patients, with median ages at diagnosis of 55 years for essential thrombocythemia, 64 years for polycythemia vera, and 63 years for primary myelofibrosis. The long-term prognosis of MPNs is measured in years, with patients with essential thrombocythemia having the best prognosis (median survival 20 years) and those with primary myelofibrosis the worst (median survival 6 years). Patients with MPNs have a predisposition to progress to myelofibrosis or acute leukemia. Moreover, clinicians have long recognized an association between MPNs and increased risk for both thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. A recent meta-analysis of 13,436 patients with MPNs showed a pooled prevalence of arterial thrombosis of 16.2% and of hemorrhagic complications of 6.2%. Indeed, cardiovascular events often accompany this cluster of hematologic conditions and contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality. Yet the mechanisms that connect MPNs with cardiovascular disease risk and thrombotic diatheses have remained elusive. Recent research has uncovered previously unsuspected pathophysiologic connections between hematologic malignancies in general, and MPNs in particular with cardiovascular complications. These advances not only furnish novel insights into mechanisms but pave the way for further steps forward in risk assessment and management, and highlight the need to develop and test targeted therapies to mitigate the increased cardiovascular disease risk associated with MPNs.

The chronic disorders of clonal hematopoiesis known as MPNs arise from somatic mutations leading to constitutive activation of the Janus-associated kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway, which regulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Mutations in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), calreticulin, and myeloproliferative leukemia protein (MPL) genes account for the vast majority of driver mutations in MPNs. Mutations in the JAK2 gene, with the JAK2 V617F mutation being the most common, are found in 95% of patients with polycythemia vera and in approximately 60% of patients with essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis. Patients with MPNs also harbor other mutations that can be associated with increased inflammation, including in tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2), DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3a), and additional sex Combs-like 1 (ASXL1) genes.

### Laboratory practice guidelines for detecting and reporting JAK2 and MPL mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology [^114ZhzEK]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2013). Medium credibility.

JAK2 V617F allele burden patterns — The allele burden varies greatly (between 1% and 100%) at first diagnosis. Approximately 20% to 30% of polycythemia vera (PV) patients have less than 25% JAK2 V617F alleles, whereas in essential thrombocythemia (ET) up to 75% of cases have a level less than 25% and a considerable number (< 40% of cases) have a level less than 10%. A quantitative assay or a reasonably sensitive qualitative assay is therefore essential, an allele burden of greater than 50% suggests homozygosity (most likely to occur in PV; uncommon in ET), and a high allele burden in PV and ET is associated with progression to myelofibrosis.

JAK2 exon 12 mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms — scope and common variants: Exon 12 alterations span a larger region "spanning codons 533 to 547" and "At least 27 clinically verified exon 12 mutations have been identified to date, including amino acid substitution, deletions, and duplications". The "most frequent exon 12 mutation involves an in-frame deletion of six nucleotides at codons 542 and 543 (N542_E543del); it is present in approximately 40% of V617F-negative PV". Other relatively common variants are listed with approximate frequencies: "F541_E543delinsK (approximately 10%), E543_D544del (approximately 10%), F537_K539delinsL (approximately 10%), K539I (approximately 10%), H538_K539delinsL (approximately 5%), and I540_E543delinsMK (approximately 5%)". Mutations "in exon 13, exon 15, and exon 14 other than V617F are exceptionally rare".

### JAK2 and MPL mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms: discovery and science [^113Q9bkR]. Leukemia (2008). Low credibility.

Although it has long been known that the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are clonal hematopoietic stem-cell disorders, for many years the genetic basis for these disorders was elusive. A new era in MPN biology began in 2005 with the discovery of a somatic point mutation in JAK2 tyrosine kinase (JAK2V617F), which was identified in a significant proportion of patients with PV, ET and PMF. Based on the hypothesis that JAK-STAT signaling is central to the pathogenesis of JAK2V617F-negative MPN, genomic studies have identified JAK2 exon 12 mutations in JAK2V617F-negative PV and activating mutations in MPL in patients with JAK2V617F-negative ET and PMF. In this review, we will discuss the role of these mutant alleles in the pathogenesis of PV, ET and PMF, the potential therapeutic implications of these discoveries, and the implications of these discoveries for genomic studies of hematopoietic malignancies.

### Genetic-pathologic characterization of myeloproliferative neoplasms [^115bnixa]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by the proliferation of one or more myeloid lineages. The current study demonstrates that three driver mutations were detected in 82.6% of 407 MPNs with a mutation distribution of JAK2 in 275 (67.6%), CALR in 55 (13.5%) and MPL in 6 (1.5%). The mutations were mutually exclusive in principle except in one patient with both CALR and MPL mutations. The driver mutation directed the pathologic features of MPNs, including lineage hyperplasia, laboratory findings and clinical presentation. JAK2 -mutated MPN showed erythroid, granulocytic and/or megakaryocytic hyperplasia whereas CALR - and MPL -mutated MPNs displayed granulocytic and/or megakaryocytic hyperplasia. The lineage hyperplasia was closely associated with a higher mutant allele burden and peripheral cytosis. These findings corroborated that the lineage hyperplasia consisted of clonal proliferation of each hematopoietic lineage acquiring driver mutations. Our study has also demonstrated that bone marrow (BM) fibrosis was associated with disease progression. Patients with overt fibrosis (grade ⩾2) presented an increased mutant allele burden (P < 0.001), an increase in chromosomal abnormalities (P < 0.001) and a poor prognosis (P < 0.001). Moreover, among patients with overt fibrosis, all patients with wild-type JAK2 / CALR / MPL (triple-negative) showed genomic alterations by genome-wide microarray study and revealed the poorest overall survival, followed by JAK2 -mutated MPNs. The genetic–pathologic characteristics provided the information for understanding disease pathogenesis and the progression of MPNs. The prognostic significance of the driver mutation and BM fibrosis suggests the necessity of a prospective therapeutic strategy to improve the clinical outcome.

### Myeloproliferative neoplasms, version 3.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113toCuR]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) — epidemiology and clinical features in the United States include Philadelphia chromosome-negative disorders myelofibrosis (MF), polycythemia vera (PV), and essential thrombocythemia (ET). The prevalence of MF, ET, and PV is estimated at approximately 13,000, 134,000, and 148,000, respectively, and in 2002–2016 data the age-adjusted IRs per 100,000 person-years were highest for PV (IR = 1.57) and ET (IR = 1.55) and was 0.44 for primary MF (PMF). MPN are characterized by a complicated symptom profile that often includes fatigue, pruritus, weight loss, and symptoms from splenomegaly, with variable laboratory abnormalities such as erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, and sometimes myeloid immaturity, especially in progressive MF. A SEER-Medicare analysis showed substantially inferior survival for patients with MPN compared to matched controls, with survival for patients with MF worse than that of patients with ET or PV and significantly worse than matched controls, and these diseases have propensity for disease transformation to blast phase (MPN-BP), which is akin to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is associated with a poor prognosis. The diagnosis and comprehensive care of patients with MPN has evolved since identification of JAK-STAT "driver" mutations (JAK2, CALR, and MPL), and development of targeted therapies has resulted in significant improvements in disease-related symptoms and quality of life, although diagnosis, assessment of symptom burden, and selection of appropriate symptom-directed therapies continue to present challenges for hematologists and oncologists.

### Genomics of MPN progression [^114Tumfy]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

The Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a heterogenous group of hematopoietic stem cell diseases characterized by activated JAK/STAT signaling and a variable propensity toward myelofibrotic and leukemic transformation. Acquisition of somatic mutations in addition to the canonical JAK2, MPL, and CALR mutations found in MPNs is an important catalyst in the clonal evolution and progression of these disorders. In recent years, our increasing understanding of the molecular landscape of Ph- MPNs has generated important prognostic information that informs our approach to risk stratification and therapeutic decision-making. This review will focus on the critical impact of genomics on our approach to management of advanced Ph- MPNs.

### Myeloproliferative neoplasms: a decade of discoveries and treatment advances [^112BtvBY]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are clonal stem cell diseases, first conceptualized in 1951 by William Dameshek, and historically included chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). In 1960, Nowell and Hungerford discovered an invariable association between the Philadelphia chromosome (subsequently shown to harbor the causal BCR-ABL1 mutation) and CML; accordingly, the term MPN is primarily reserved for PV, ET, and PMF, although it includes other related clinicopathologic entities, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system. In 2005, William Vainchenker and others described a Janus kinase 2 mutation (JAK2V617F) in MPN and this was followed by a series of additional descriptions of mutations that directly or indirectly activate JAK-STAT: JAK2 exon 12, myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) and calreticulin (CALR) mutations. The discovery of these, mostly mutually exclusive, "driver" mutations has contributed to revisions of the WHO diagnostic criteria and risk stratification in MPN. Mutations other than JAK2, CALR and MPL have also been described in MPN and shown to provide additional prognostic information. From the standpoint of treatment, over the last 50 years, Louis Wasserman from the Unites States and Tiziano Barbui from Italy had skillfully organized and led a number of important clinical trials, whose results form the basis for current treatment strategies in MPN. More recently, allogeneic stem cell transplant, as a potentially curative treatment modality, and JAK inhibitors, as palliative drugs, have been added to the overall therapeutic armamentarium in myelofibrosis. In the current review, I will summarize the important advances made in the last 10 years regarding the science and practice of MPN.

### Detection of CALR and MPL mutations in low allelic burden JAK2 V617F essential thrombocythemia [^115qtqPH]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2017). Low credibility.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by aberrant proliferation and an increased tendency toward leukemic transformation. The genes JAK2, MPL, and CALR are frequently altered in these syndromes, and their mutations are often a strong argument for diagnosis. We analyzed the mutational profiles of these three genes in a cohort of 164 suspected myeloproliferative neoplasms. JAK2 V617F mutation was detected by real-time PCR, whereas high-resolution melting analysis followed by Sanger sequencing were used for searching for mutations in JAK2 exon 12, CALR, and MPL. JAK2 V617F mutation was associated with CALR (n = 4) and MPL (n = 4) mutations in 8 of 103 essential thrombocytosis patients. These cases were harboring a JAK2 V617F allelic burden of < 4% and a significantly higher platelet count compared with JAK2 V617F (P < 0.001) and CALR (P = 0.001) single-mutation patients. The findings from this study support the possibility of coexisting mutations of the JAK2, CALR, and MPL genes in myeloproliferative neoplasms and suggest that CALR and MPL should be analyzed not only in JAK2-negative patients but also in low V617F mutation patients. Follow-up of these double-mutation cases will be important for determining whether this group of patients presents particular evolution or complications.

### JAK2 (and other genes) be nimble with MPN diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy [^111Ez7qa]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

Now that the spectrum of somatic mutations that initiate, propagate, and drive the progression of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) has largely been defined, recent efforts have focused on integrating this information into clinical decision making. In this regard, the greatest progress has been made in myelofibrosis, in which high-molecular-risk mutations have been identified and incorporated into prognostic models to help guide treatment decisions. In this chapter, we focus on advances in 4 main areas: (1) What are the MPN phenotypic driver mutations? (2) What constitutes high molecular risk in MPN (focusing on ASXL1)? (3) How do we risk-stratify patients with MPN? And (4) What is the significance of molecular genetics for MPN treatment? Although substantial progress has been made, we still have an incomplete understanding of the molecular basis for phenotypic diversity in MPN, and few rationally designed therapeutic approaches to target high-risk mutations are available. Ongoing research efforts in these areas are critical to understanding the biological consequences of genetic heterogeneity in MPN and to improving outcomes for patients.

### Differential in vivo roles of MPL cytoplasmic tyrosine residues in murine hematopoiesis and myeloproliferative disease [^115ZujHK]. Leukemia (2024). Medium credibility.

Activation of the JAK/STAT pathway is integral to the development of the Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), including polycythaemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythaemia (ET) and myelofibrosis (MF). Mutations in JAK2 account for almost all PV and over 50% of ET and primary MF, with mutations in CALR, which result in activation of MPL, or mutations in MPL itself, accounting for much of the remainder. Indeed, to drive MPN development, mutant forms of Jak2 and Calr require a functional homodimeric type I cytokine receptor such as Mpl.

Here, we have generated Mpl mutations in the mouse germline to study the roles of receptor intracellular domains and tyrosine residues in normal and pathophysiological actions of Tpo/Mpl signalling under endogenous regulation of receptor expression. We find a consistent physiological requirement for Mpl-Y599, mutation of which resulted in thrombocytopenia, deficient megakaryopoiesis, reduced HSC number and function, and attenuated responses to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment. Moreover, the thrombocytosis driven by MPN-associated mutations in Jak2 and h Calr was dependent on intact Mpl-Y599. In contrast, Mpl-Y565 was required for attenuation of TPO responses; mutation resulted in excess megakaryopoiesis at steady-state and in response to 5-FU, and exacerbated mutant Jak2 and h Calr -driven MPN.

JAK2 and MPL follow-up testing — utility and scheduling: although allele burden may decrease with some inhibitors, there is no one-to-one correlation of allele burden with clinical response; highly sensitive qPCR for JAK2 V617F may have value in follow-up after allogeneic stem cell transplantation and quantitative tests have been used to determine depth of clinical remission and to guide adoptive immunotherapy, but for routine clinical practice there is no recommended schedule for follow-up JAK2 testing (qualitative or quantitative), and there is a dearth of follow-up information for MPL mutation analysis.

### Essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and myelofibrosis: current management and the prospect of targeted therapy [^112KaA77]. American Journal of Hematology (2008). Low credibility.

The recent discovery of JAK2 and/or MPL mutations in polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) has had a major impact on how we diagnose and treat these disorders. For instance, the presence of a JAK2 mutation is now considered conditio sine qua non for the diagnosis of PV and the World Health Organization classification system has recently revised its diagnostic criteria for PV, ET, and PMF to include JAK2 and MPL mutations as clonal markers. From the standpoint of treatment, JAK-STAT is now identified as a legitimate target pathway for drug development in myeloproliferative neoplasms. Herein, I will first outline my views regarding current management in ET, PV, and PMF and then discuss emerging data on preclinical and clinical activity of anti-JAK2 small molecule drugs. Am. J.

### CALR, JAK2, and MPL mutation profiles in patients with four different subtypes of myeloproliferative neoplasms: primary myelofibrosis, essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable [^1172mwet]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

We investigated mutation profiles of CALR, JAK2, and MPL in 199 Korean patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs).

Methods

In total, 199 patients with MPN (54 primary myelofibrosis [PMF], 79 essential thrombocythemia [ET], 58 polycythemia vera [PV], and eight MPN-unclassifiable [MPN-U]) and 4 patients with acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis (APMF) were retrospectively subjected to Sanger sequencing for CALR, JAK2, and MPL.

Results

The overall frequency of CALR mutations was 12.6% (type 1 mutation, 16 patients; type 2 mutation, nine patients): most frequent in MPN-U (37.5%), followed by ET (17.7%) and PMF (14.8%). CALR mutations were not found in PV or APMF. CALR and JAK2 or MPL mutations were mutually exclusive. In PMF, the CALR mutations were associated with lower levels of leukocytes, lower bone marrow cellularity, and higher number of megakaryocytes. Patients with CALR-mutated ET more frequently progressed to the accelerated or blast phases compared with patients with JAK2 mutations. CALR mutations were frequently observed in the JAK2-negative MPNs, most frequently in MPN-U.

Conclusions

The prognostic significance of CALR mutations likely differs among the MPN subtypes.

### Diagnosis, risk stratification, and response evaluation in classical myeloproliferative neoplasms [^114m4ViB]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Philadelphia-negative classical myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) include polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). The 2016 revision of the WHO Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues includes new criteria for the diagnosis of these disorders. Somatic mutations in the 3 driver genes, that is, JAK2, CALR, and MPL, represent major diagnostic criteria in combination with hematologic and morphological abnormalities. PV is characterized by erythrocytosis with suppressed endogenous erythropoietin production, bone marrow panmyelosis, and JAK2 mutation. Thrombocytosis, bone marrow megakaryocytic proliferation, and presence of JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutation are the main diagnostic criteria for ET. PMF is characterized by bone marrow megakaryocytic proliferation, reticulin and/or collagen fibrosis, and presence of JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutation. Prefibrotic myelofibrosis represents an early phase of myelofibrosis, and is characterized by granulocytic/megakaryocytic proliferation and lack of reticulin fibrosis in the bone marrow. The genomic landscape of MPNs is more complex than initially thought and involves several mutant genes beyond the 3 drivers. Comutated, myeloid tumor-suppressor genes contribute to phenotypic variability, phenotypic shifts, and progression to more aggressive disorders. Patients with myeloid neoplasms are at variable risk of vascular complications, including arterial or venous thrombosis and bleeding. Current prognostic models are mainly based on clinical and hematologic parameters, but innovative models that include genetic data are being developed for both clinical and trial settings. In perspective, molecular profiling of MPNs might also allow for accurate evaluation and monitoring of response to innovative drugs that target the mutant clone.

### Hematopoietic fitness of JAK2V617F myeloproliferative neoplasms is linked to clinical outcome [^116kaogD]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

Classical myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are chronic, phenotypically diverse malignanciesassociated with significant morbidity, shortened survival, and limited treatment options. Development of life-prolonging, potentially curative drugs in MPNs has been more challenging than expected for neoplasms harboring highly recurrent driver mutations that activate targetable tyrosine kinases. Decades of monitoring may be required for analysis of the most important clinical outcomes in MPNs: thrombosis, progression, and mortality. This has prompted use of more convenient clinical trial endpoints with unclear connection to these long-term events. Short-term biomarkers linking MPN biology to event risk may help identify and develop disease-modifying agents with greatest potential to improve event-free survival (EFS). Unfortunately, no such biomarkers are presently available.

MPNs are initiated by acquisition of a driver mutation in a single hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) decades prior to clinically evident MPN. Driver mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL augment JAK/STAT cytokine signaling pathways and offer MPN stem and progenitor cells (MPN-SPCs), and their progeny, a competitive advantage to supplant their normal cellular counterparts and manifest disease. Given the centrality of driver mutations to MPN biology, JAK2 V617F mutation allele frequency (MAF) is an appealing biomarker because this mutation is present in the majority of MPNs and is easily measured in whole blood (WB). Nevertheless, this approach has been disappointing because WB MAF does not accurately distinguish clinical phenotypes or predict outcomes. Although WB MAF > 50% can identify patients with polycythemia vera (PV) at higher risk for venous thrombotic events, fewer than a quarter of these patients experienced a venous thrombotic event within 20 years of measurement. Similarly, among 240 patients with available WB MAF in our large single-center PV cohort, EFS was indistinguishable by WB MAF for 75% of patients (supplemental Figure 1A, quartiles Q1-Q3). Changes in WB MAF did not predict EFS (supplemental Figure 1B), suggesting that WB MAF was inadequate as a monitoring biomarker.

### Genotype-phenotype interactions in the myeloproliferative neoplasms [^112eawcq]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal disorders characterized by overproduction of mature myeloid cells. They share associations with molecular abnormalities such as the JAK2V617F mutation but are distinguished by important phenotypic differences. This review first considers the factors that may influence phenotype in JAK2-mutated MPNs, especially polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET), and then discusses the mutations implicated in JAK2-negative MPNs such as in MPL and epigenetic regulators. Current evidence supports a model where ET and PV are disorders of relatively low genetic complexity, whereas evolution to myelofibrosis or blast-phase disease reflects accumulation of a higher mutation burden.

### An overview on CALR and CSF3R mutations and a proposal for revision of WHO diagnostic criteria for myeloproliferative neoplasms [^1148yaMJ]. Leukemia (2014). Low credibility.

Disease-specific mutations facilitate diagnostic precision and drug target discovery. In myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), this is best exemplified by the chronic myeloid leukemia-associated BCR-ABL1. No other mutation in MPN has thus far shown a similar degree of diagnostic accuracy or therapeutic relevance. However, JAK2 and KIT mutations are detected in more than 90% of patients with polycythemia vera and systemic mastocytosis, respectively, and are therefore used as highly sensitive clonal markers in these diseases. JAK2 and MPL mutations also occur in essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), but their diagnostic value is limited by suboptimal sensitivity and specificity. The molecular diagnostic gap in JAK2/MPL-unmutated ET/PMF is now partially addressed by the recent discovery of calreticulin (CALR) mutations in the majority of such cases. However, bone marrow morphology remains the central diagnostic platform and is essential for distinguishing ET from prefibrotic PMF and diagnosing patients those do not express JAK2, MPL or CALR (triple-negative). The year 2013 was also marked by the description of CSF3R mutations in the majority of patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL). Herein, we argue for the inclusion of CALR and CSF3R mutations in the World Health Organization classification system for ET/PMF and CNL, respectively.

Molecular testing in suspected MPN — molecular testing on blood or bone marrow for JAK2 V617F mutations is recommended as part of initial workup for all patients; if JAK2 V617F mutation testing is negative, molecular testing for CALR and MPL mutations should be performed for patients with suspected ET and MF, and molecular testing for the JAK2 exon 12 mutation should be done for those with suspected PV and negative for the JAK2 V617F mutation. Alternatively, molecular testing using the multigene NGS panel that includes JAK2, CALR, and MPL can be used as part of initial workup for all patients. Once an MPN diagnosis is confirmed, NGS is recommended for mutational prognostication, and the application of an NGS-based 28-gene panel in patients with MPN identified significantly more mutated splicing genes (SF3B1, SRSF2, and U2AF1) in patients with PMF compared to those with ET, and no mutations in splicing genes were found in patients with PV; NGS may also be useful to establish the clonality in selected circumstances and can also identify second, third, and fourth mutations that may hold prognostic relevance.

MPL geneListen to pronunciationA gene that makes a protein that helps control the number of blood cells that are made in the bone marrow, especially platelets. Mutated forms of the MPL gene may cause the body to make abnormal blood cells or too many platelets. Mutations in this gene have been found in some types of blood conditions, including essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis.

### Differential in vivo roles of MPL cytoplasmic tyrosine residues in murine hematopoiesis and myeloproliferative disease [^114ei4nM]. Leukemia (2024). Medium credibility.

Thrombopoietin (Tpo), which binds to its specific receptor, the Mpl protein, is the major cytokine regulator of megakaryopoiesis and circulating platelet number. Tpo binding to Mpl triggers activation of Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) and phosphorylation of the receptor, as well as activation of several intracellular signalling cascades that mediate cellular responses. Three tyrosine (Y) residues in the C-terminal region of the Mpl intracellular domain have been implicated as sites of phosphorylation required for regulation of major Tpo-stimulated signalling pathways: Mpl-Y565, Mpl-Y599 and Mpl-Y604. Here, we have introduced mutations in the mouse germline and report a consistent physiological requirement for Mpl-Y599, mutation of which resulted in thrombocytopenia, deficient megakaryopoiesis, low hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) number and function, and attenuated responses to myelosuppression. We further show that in models of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), where Mpl is required for pathogenesis, thrombocytosis was dependent on intact Mpl-Y599. In contrast, Mpl-Y565 was required for negative regulation of Tpo responses; mutation of this residue resulted in excess megakaryopoiesis at steady-state and in response to myelosuppression, and exacerbated thrombocytosis associated with MPN.

Quantitative JAK2 V617F reporting — reports "should include a statement of qualitative results (eg, JAK2 V617F mutation DETECTED), as well as a statement of quantitative allele burden". Allele burden may be expressed as "a ratio of mutant (mut) to wild-type (wt) alleles, or more commonly, as a percentage of mutated JAK2 alleles, calculated as (JAK2mut/(JAK2mut + JAK2wt) × 100". If available, "results of prior serial testing may be provided". If thresholds are used, "If a quantitative cutoff is used to define a positive result, this value should be stated as part of the methodology summary, and a limit of sensitivity must also be included". Semiquantitative reporting can use ranges such as " > 50% to 75% mutant alleles", and although literature has used "allele burdens of < 50% and ≥ 50%", "the terms heterozygous and homozygous should generally be avoided in clinical reports".

INTRODUCTION

The classical Philadelphia chromosome‐negative (Ph −) myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are characterised by the overproduction of blood cells derived from haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that harbour mutations resulting in cytokine‐independent or hypersensitive proliferative signals. The three most common MPNs are essential thrombocythaemia (ET), polycythaemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), each with overlapping clinical and laboratory findings that can make their distinction challenging, particularly at early disease time points. In over 90% of MPN, a driver mutation in the genes encoding JAK2, CALR or MPL results in constitutive activation of the MPL‐JAK–STAT signalling pathway. Despite this commonality, the disease phenotype and risk of progression in MPN are highly variable. This is partly determined by enhanced mutational allele frequencies of oncogenic drivers or the co‐occurrence/acquisition of additional mutations within the clonal population. Genes encoding transcriptional regulators, epigenetic regulators, splicing factors and apoptotic signalling pathways are all implicated in disease progression in MPN and ultimately contribute to the disease phenotype. However, it is increasingly recognised that intimate and complex cellular and stromal interactions within the bone marrow microenvironment are also central to the very earliest stages of MPN initiation. Indeed, inflammatory changes occurring within the stem cell niche, fuelled by monocytes and megakaryocytes, may even precede the acquisition of driver mutations in MPN. In the context of primary myelofibrosis (PMF), the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to fibrosis‐driving myofibroblasts appears to be dependent upon these initial inflammatory changes. Subsequent progression to severe marrow fibrosis determines the distinctive clinical features of PMF, with hallmark cytopenias, extra‐medullary haematopoiesis, hepatosplenomegaly and cytokine‐driven systemic symptoms.

### Essential thrombocythemia [^112k81Zq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on essential thrombocythemia:

- **Definition**: ET is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal proliferation of megakaryocytes leading to sustained thrombocytosis (platelets ≥ 450×10⁹/L). The disease most often results from driver mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL and manifests with increased thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk, vasomotor symptoms, and, less frequently, progression to myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia.
- **Pathophysiology**: ET results from constitutive activation of cytokine signaling, most frequently through the JAK2V617F mutation, found in about 60% of patients, or through CALR or MPL mutations, found in about 20–25% and 3–4%, respectively. These driver mutations stimulate uncontrolled megakaryocytic proliferation and platelet production. Additional mutations in genes such as ASXL1, TET2, DNMT3A, SF3B1, or TP53 can influence disease behavior and risk of progression. Abnormal interactions between activated platelets and the vascular endothelium contribute to thrombotic events, while very high platelet counts may cause acquired von Willebrand syndrome and bleeding.
- **Epidemiology**: ET has an incidence of about 1.5–2 cases per 100,000 persons each year and is most common in older adults, though up to one fifth of patients are diagnosed before the age of 40. Women are slightly more often affected than men. It accounts for about one third of all myeloproliferative neoplasms. About 10–15% of patients lack detectable mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL and are referred to as triple-negative.
- **Risk factors**: The primary risk factors for ET include age and genetic predisposition.
- **Disease course**: The disease often remains stable for many years but can be interrupted by vascular complications. Thrombosis is the most frequent cause of morbidity, occurring in about 15–20% of patients, especially in those > 60 years or carrying a JAK2 mutation. Hemorrhagic events may occur, particularly in the setting of extreme thrombocytosis. Progression to post-ET myelofibrosis occurs in about 5–10% of cases, and transformation to acute leukemia in less than 2% over ten years. Median survival is about 18–20 years overall and exceeds 30 years in younger individuals. Prognostic models such as the triple A system, which considers age, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts, or mutationally enhanced models that include adverse mutations, help stratify outcomes. Triple-negative disease generally has the most favorable prognosis.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Life expectancy in ET is somewhat reduced compared with the general population but remains substantially better than in other myeloproliferative neoplasms such as polycythemia vera or myelofibrosis. Median survival is approximately 18 years but can exceed 35 years in younger patients. Adverse prognostic factors include advanced age, leukocytosis, abnormal karyotype, and mutations in SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, or TP53. Patients with CALR type 2 mutations or triple-negative status have the lowest risk of thrombosis and longest survival, whereas those with CALR type 1 or MPL mutations are more prone to fibrotic transformation. The major therapeutic focus remains prevention of thrombosis and close monitoring for disease progression.

### Role of TET2 and ASXL1 mutations in the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms [^112NPusT]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Since the discovery of activating mutations in JAK2 in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) in 2005, gene discovery efforts have identified additional disease alleles, which can predate or occur subsequent to acquisition of JAK2/MPL mutations. In 2009, somatic copy number loss and mutations in the genes TET2 and ASXL1 were identified in MPN patients. Genetic analysis of MPN patient cohorts with adequate sample size and clear clinical annotation are needed to understand the importance of these mutations on MPN phenotype, risk of transformation to leukemia, response to therapy, and influence on overall survival.

Introduction

Seminal papers over the past four decades have described phenotypic driver mutations, such as BCR-ABL1, JAK2, MPL, CALR, KIT and CSF3R, in subsets of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). These mutations affect cytokine signaling or regulation, and result in malignant hematopoiesis. Such discoveries and the accompanying biological insights have resulted in successful therapeutic approaches for many people diagnosed with MPN, in particular chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), myelofibrosis (MF) and systemic mastocytosis (SM). The greatest advance has been in CML, with a significant proportion of patients being able to achieve a major molecular response (MMR or MR3; BCR-ABL1 ≤ 0.1% on the International Scale) following treatment with an ABL1-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), leading to these patients having lifespans indistinguishable from those of the general population, although the time by which this response milestone should be reached remains controversial. Qualified success with significant symptomatic benefit and modest gains in survival have also been achieved in people with MF and SM, following treatment with JAK inhibitors and KIT inhibitors, respectively. Some of these achievements have been facilitated by the rational integration of next-generation sequencing (NGS) assays, high-sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays on DNA or RNA (sensitivity 0.01%- 0.1%), and single-cell analyses, in efforts to improve personalized treatment approaches. Such efforts have opened a new era of precision medicine for diverse malignancies in which relatively non-specific and often toxic drugs are being replaced by safer and better tolerated agents whose mechanism of action is precisely defined, and for which the treatment algorithm is guided by individual genetic information. Here we examine how molecular testing in MPN can shape diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment algorithms and enable more precise early identification of targeted therapy resistance, particularly in CML (Figure 1). We also discuss the potential impact of persistent or new clonal hematopoiesis on the molecular testing of individuals with MPN and the potential impact on measurable residual disease. This manuscript describes some of the current highlights and challenges related to genetic testing in MPN in 2021.

Recurrent mutations in JAK2 and MPL genes are genetic hallmarks of BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms. Detection of JAK2 and MPL mutations has been incorporated into routine diagnostic algorithms for these diseases. This Special Article summarizes results from a nationwide laboratory survey of JAK2 and MPL mutation analysis. Based on the current practice pattern and the literature, this Special Article provides recommendations and guidelines for laboratory practice for detection of mutations in the JAK2 and MPL genes, including clinical manifestations for prompting the mutation analysis, current and recommended methodologies for testing the mutations, and standardization for reporting the test results. This Special Article also points to future directions for genomic testing in BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms.

### Myeloproliferative neoplasms: molecular pathophysiology, essential clinical understanding, and treatment strategies… [^114KszfG]. ASCO (2011). Low credibility.

Pathogenetic mechanisms in PV, ET, and PMF include stem cell–derived clonal myeloproliferation and secondary stromal changes in the bone marrow and spleen. Most patients carry an activating JAK2or MPLmutation and a smaller subset also harbors LNK, CBL, TET2, ASXL1, IDH, IKZF1, or EZH2mutations; the precise pathogenetic contribution of these mutations is under investigation. Jak2v617f JAK2V617F is the most prevalent mutation in BCR-ABL1–negative MPN: mutational frequency of approximately 96% in PV, 55% in ET, and 65% in PMF. The mutation affects the noncatalytic domain of JAK2 and disrupts its kinase-regulatory activity. 23, 24 JAK2V617F can become undetectable during leukemic transformation and a lower mutant allele burden has been associated with inferior survival in PMF. 25, 26 JAK2 Exon 12 Mutations JAK2exon 12 mutations are relatively specific to.

MPLoncogene; 1p34) W515L mutation was first described in JAK2V617F-negative PMF and induces a PMF-like disease with thrombocytosis in mice. 10Subsequently, MPLW515K and other exon 10 MPLmutations were described in approximately 3% of patients with ET and 10% of those with PMF. 11, 30–32 MPLmutations in MPN have been associated with older age, female sex, lower hemoglobin level, and higher platelet count. 30–32 TET2 Mutations TET2 mutations are seen in both. The specific mutation variants so far seen in MPN include IDH1R132C, IDH1R132S, and IDH2R140Q. Functional characterization of IDHmutations suggests neoenzymatic activity in converting α-ketoglutarate to the putatively oncogenic 2-hydroxyglutarate.

### Molecular profiling in MPN: who should have it and why? [^114yBmMS]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Medium credibility.

Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of blood cancers that result from somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells, causing constitutive activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathways with consequent overproduction of 1 or more myeloid lineages. The initiating event in MPN pathogenesis is a genetic mutation, and consequently molecular profiling is central to the diagnosis, risk stratification, and, increasingly, monitoring of therapy response in persons with MPN. In this review we summarize current approaches to molecular profiling of classical MPNs (essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and myelofibrosis), using illustrative clinical case histories to demonstrate how genetic analysis is already fully integrated into MPN diagnostic classification and prognostic risk stratification. Molecular profiling can also be used in MPN to measure response to therapy both in clinical trials and increasingly in routine clinical practice. Taking a forward look, we discuss how molecular profiling in MPN might be used in the future to select specific molecularly targeted therapies and the role of additional genetic methodologies beyond mutation analysis.

### Genetic basis and molecular profiling in myeloproliferative neoplasms [^112usKWB]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

BCR::ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal diseases originating from a single hematopoietic stem cell that cause excessive production of mature blood cells. The 3 subtypes, that is, polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), are diagnosed according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and international consensus classification (ICC) criteria. Acquired gain-of-function mutations in 1 of 3 disease driver genes (JAK2, CALR, and MPL) are the causative events that can alone initiate and promote MPN disease without requiring additional cooperating mutations. JAK2-p.V617F is present in > 95% of PV patients, and also in about half of the patients with ET or PMF. ET and PMF are also caused by mutations in CALR or MPL. In ∼10% of MPN patients, those referred to as being "triple negative", none of the known driver gene mutations can be detected. The common theme between the 3 driver gene mutations and triple-negative MPN is that the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway is constitutively activated. We review the recent advances in our understanding of the early events after the acquisition of a driver gene mutation. The limiting factor that determines the frequency at which MPN disease develops with a long latency is not the acquisition of driver gene mutations, but rather the expansion of the clone. Factors that control the conversion from clonal hematopoiesis to MPN disease include inherited predisposition, presence of additional mutations, and inflammation. The full extent of knowledge of the mutational landscape in individual MPN patients is now increasingly being used to predict outcome and chose the optimal therapy.

### MPL mutations in myeloproliferative disorders: analysis of the PT-1 cohort [^111yb3nN]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

Activating mutations of MPL exon 10 have been described in a minority of patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF) or essential thrombocythemia (ET), but their prevalence and clinical significance are unclear. Here we demonstrate that MPL mutations outside exon 10 are uncommon in platelet cDNA and identify 4 different exon 10 mutations in granulocyte DNA from a retrospective cohort of 200 patients with ET or IMF. Allele-specific polymerase chain reaction was then used to genotype 776 samples from patients with ET entered into the PT-1 studies. MPL mutations were identified in 8.5% of JAK2 V617F(-) patients and a single V617F(+) patient. Patients carrying the W515K allele had a significantly higher allele burden than did those with the W515L allele, suggesting a functional difference between the 2 variants. Compared with V617F(+) ET patients, those with MPL mutations displayed lower hemoglobin and higher platelet levels at diagnosis, higher serum erythropoietin levels, endogenous megakaryocytic but not erythroid colony growth, and reduced bone marrow erythroid and overall cellularity. Compared with V617F(-) patients, those with MPL mutations were older with reduced bone marrow cellularity but could not be identified as a discrete clinicopathologic subgroup. MPL mutations lacked prognostic significance with respect to thrombosis, major hemorrhage, myelofibrotic transformation or survival.

### From Janus kinase 2 to calreticulin: the clinically relevant genomic landscape of myeloproliferative neoplasms [^116Efktg]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the genetic basis of myeloproliferative neoplasms began in 2005, when the JAK2 (V617F) mutation was identified in polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis. JAK2 exon 12 and MPL exon 10 mutations were then detected in subsets of patients, and subclonal driver mutations in other genes were found to be associated with disease progression. Recently, somatic mutations in the gene CALR, encoding calreticulin, have been found in most patients with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis with nonmutated JAK2 and MPL. The JAK-STAT pathway appears to be activated in all myeloproliferative neoplasms, regardless of founding driver mutations. These latter, however, have different effects on clinical course and outcomes. Thus, evaluation of JAK2, MPL, and CALR mutation status is important not only for diagnosis but also for prognostication. These genetic data should now also be considered in designing clinical trials.

### Genetic basis and molecular pathophysiology of classical myeloproliferative neoplasms [^114Mrdwh]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

The genetic landscape of classical myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) is in large part elucidated. The MPN-restricted driver mutations, including those in JAK2, calreticulin (CALR), and myeloproliferative leukemia virus (MPL), abnormally activate the cytokine receptor/JAK2 pathway and their downstream effectors, more particularly the STATs. The most frequent mutation, JAK2 V617F, activates the 3 main myeloid cytokine receptors (erythropoietin receptor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor, and MPL) whereas CALR or MPL mutants are restricted to MPL activation. This explains why JAK2 V617F is associated with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) whereas CALR and MPL mutants are found in ET and PMF. Other mutations in genes involved in epigenetic regulation, splicing, and signaling cooperate with the 3 MPN drivers and play a key role in the PMF pathogenesis. Mutations in epigenetic regulators TET2 and DNMT3A are involved in disease initiation and may precede the acquisition of JAK2 V617F. Other mutations in epigenetic regulators such as EZH2 and ASXL1 also play a role in disease initiation and disease progression. Mutations in the splicing machinery are predominantly found in PMF and are implicated in the development of anemia or pancytopenia. Both heterogeneity of classical MPNs and prognosis are determined by a specific genomic landscape, that is, type of MPN driver mutations, association with other mutations, and their order of acquisition. However, factors other than somatic mutations play an important role in disease initiation as well as disease progression such as germ line predisposition, inflammation, and aging. Delineation of these environmental factors will be important to better understand the precise pathogenesis of MPN.

### Novel mutations and their functional and clinical relevance in myeloproliferative neoplasms: JAK2, MPL, TET2, ASXL1, CBL, IDH and IKZF1 [^1137VkCt]. Leukemia (2010). Low credibility.

As is the case with JAK2 mutations, MPL 515 mutations are stem cell-derived events that involve both myeloid and lymphoid progenitors. MPL mutant-induced oncogenesis also results in constitutive JAK-STAT activation and might require specific MPL mutant variants (such as MPL W515)and receptor residues (such as Y112). Some patients with ET or PMF display multiple MPL mutations and others a low allele burden JAK2 V617F clone together with a higher allele burden MPL mutation. Homozygosity for MPL mutations is also ascribed to acquired uniparental disomy, as is the case with JAK2 V617F.

MPL -mutated ET has been associated with older age, lower hemoglobin level, higher platelet count, microvascular symptoms and a higher risk of post-diagnosis arterial thrombosis. The presence of MPL mutation did not appear to affect survival, fibrotic or leukemic transformation. MPL -mutated PMF has been associated with the female gender, older age, lower hemoglobin level and a higher likelihood of becoming transfusion dependent. This set of findings suggests a phenotype-modifying effect that is different from that seen with a JAK2 mutation.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms are hematopoietic stem cell disorders based on somatic mutations in JAK2, calreticulin, or MPL activating JAK-STAT signaling. Modern sequencing efforts have revealed the genomic landscape of myeloproliferative neoplasms with additional genetic alterations mainly in epigenetic modifiers and splicing factors. High molecular risk mutations with adverse outcomes have been identified and clonal evolution may promote progression to fibrosis and acute myeloid leukemia. JAK2V617F is recurrently detected in clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential with increased risk for vascular events. Insights into the genetics of myeloproliferative neoplasms has facilitated diagnosis and prognostication and poses novel candidates for targeted therapeutic intervention.

### A prognostic model to predict survival after 6 months of ruxolitinib in patients with myelofibrosis [^112VHW1A]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Among myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), myelofibrosis (MF) is characterized by the most heterogeneous clinical picture and the most severe prognosis. The disease can occur as primary myelofibrosis (PMF) or secondary to an antecedent diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia (ET) or polycythemia vera (PV), collectively referred to as secondary myelofibrosis (SMF). This distinction has further clinical and prognostic relevance. Most MF patients harbor a somatic driver mutation in JAK2, CALR, or MPL, often coexisting with additional mutations. Both categories of genetic variants impact phenotype and prognosis. The addition of genetic information to clinical variables has allowed to update prognostic models, which are currently extensively used to inform treatment decisions and enrollment in clinical trials. The JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib (RUX) is the first approved drug for the treatment of MF, with efficacy in terms of spleen volume reduction and symptom relief, mostly obtained within the first 6 months of treatment. An improvement of overall survival (OS) with RUX has been reported in a posthoc pooled analysis of the registration trials, in a comparison of phase 1/2 trial data with matched historical controls, and in a recently reported registry study.

Nonetheless, RUX therapy is burdened by a substantial proportion of suboptimal responses, loss of response over time, and significant discontinuation rates in clinical trials, and in the real-world setting. Pre-RUX factors associated with lower spleen response rates include higher risk MF, large splenomegaly, transfusion-dependency, platelet count < 200 × 10⁹/L, a time-interval between MF diagnosis and RUX start > 2 years, RUX as ≥ second-line treatment, any genotype other than JAK2 V617F with ≥ 50% allele burden, and ≥ 3 mutations identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Data on fatality after RUX discontinuationcollectively indicate the need for effective second-line treatments.

Multiple trials focusing on RUX-treated patients (ie, individuals who are relapsed/refractory, suboptimal responders, or intolerant to RUX) have been conducted or are underway. However, given the absence of clinically relevant endpoints associated with differential responses to RUX and the consequent heterogeneity of trial inclusion criteria, even cautious comparisons of outcomes among studies are unreliable. In the real world, the definition of the optimal timing for a treatment shift or stem cell transplant (SCT) after RUX is a recognized unmet medical need.

MPNs include chronic myelogenous leukemia, essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, primary myelofibrosis, and several other disorders. The newer classification system incorporates mutations discovered in the JAK2 and MPL genes. The importance of understanding the role of mutations in JAK2, MPL, and other genes that have been discovered in MPNs is highlighted by the change in the 2008 WHO MPN classification system. Moreover, the development of highly specific inhibitors of JAK2 further stresses the importance of molecular testing in MPN diagnosis and prognosis.

### Navigating the evolving paradigms in the diagnosis and treatment of myeloproliferative disorders [^115SG8L8]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of the BCR-ABL-negative myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) of polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are at an explosive crossroads of scientific investigation and evolving paradigms since the discovery of the tyrosine kinase-activating JAK2V617F mutation in 2005. Additional discovery of relevant molecular lesions (JAK2 exon 12 mutations and c-MplW515L/K) have only further enriched our understanding of MPD pathogenesis. The improved diagnostic certainty these molecular markers provide have resulted in the modification, and simplification, of the World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic algorithms for MPDs. Despite these scientific advances, however, the initial management of MPDs continues to rely upon a risk-based strategy to minimize the risk of vascular events with control of erythrocytosis, targeted antiplatelet therapy, and risk-based myelosuppressive therapy. No current medical therapy has altered the natural trend of the MPDs to lead to overt severe myelofibrosis or acute leukemia. Investigations into targeted therapies for MPDs are proceeding at a brisk pace with agents aimed at immunomodulation, decreasing marrow stromal reaction to the aberrant clone, DNA hypomethylation, or the inhibition of tyrosine kinases. Specific inhibition of JAK2 itself appears promising by in vitro investigations, and clinical trials with multiple agents are planned to commence enrollment in 2007. The potential impact of JAK2 inhibitors on the manifestations of the MPDs is unclear, but is awaited with great interest.

### JAK and MPL mutations in myeloid malignancies [^113A3y1n]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2008). Low credibility.

The Janus family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and tyrosine kinase 2) transduces signals downstream of type I and II cytokine receptors via signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). JAK3 is important in lymphoid and JAK2 in myeloid cell proliferation and differentiation. The thrombopoietin receptor MPL is one of several JAK2 cognate receptors and is essential for myelopoiesis in general and megakaryopoiesis in particular. Germline loss-of-function (LOF) JAK3 and MPL mutations cause severe combined immunodeficiency and congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, respectively. Germline gain-of-function (GOF) MPL mutation (MPLS505N) causes familial thrombocytosis. Somatic JAK3 (e.g. JAK3A572V, JAK3V722I, JAK3P132T) and fusion JAK2 (e.g. ETV6-JAK2, PCM1-JAK2, BCR-JAK2) mutations have respectively been described in acute megakaryocytic leukemia and acute leukemia/chronic myeloid malignancies. However, current attention is focused on JAK2 (e.g. JAK2V617F, JAK2 exon 12 mutations) and MPL (e.g. MPLW515L/K/S, MPLS505N) mutations associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). A JAK2 mutation, primarily JAK2V617F, is invariably associated with polycythemia vera (PV). The latter mutation also occurs in the majority of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) or primary myelofibrosis (PMF). MPL mutational frequency in MPNs is substantially less (< 10%). In general, despite a certain degree of genotype - phenotype correlations, the prognostic relevance of harbouring one of these mutations, or their allele burden when present, remains dubious. Regardless, based on the logical assumption that amplified JAK-STAT signalling is central to the pathogenesis of PV, ET and PMF, several anti-JAK2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed and are currently being tested in humans with these disorders.

### Myeloproliferative neoplasms, version 3.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1152B3Mx]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

NCCN Myeloproliferative Neoplasms — WHO and ICC diagnostic criteria for essential thrombocythemia (ET) list four major criteria: platelet count ≥ 450 × 10⁹/L; bone marrow biopsy showing proliferation mainly of the megakaryocytic lineage with increased numbers of enlarged, mature megakaryocytes with hyperlobulated nuclei and no significant increase or left shift in neutrophil granulopoiesis or erythropoiesis; WHO criteria for BCR::ABL1-positive CML, PV, PMF, and other myeloid neoplasms are not met; and JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutation. Minor criteria are presence of a clonal marker or exclusion of reactive thrombocytosis. The diagnosis of ET requires either all the major criteria or the first 3 major criteria plus a minor criterion to be met.
