## Question

Xray showing the lumbar vertebral bodies are intact and in anatomic alignment on the lateral view with minor anterolisthesis at L4/5 and retrolisthesis at L1/2. On the frontal view, there is minimal right lateral listhesis at L3. There is mild degenerative disc changes at L2/3, L3/4, L4/5 there is moderate facet sclerosis at L4/5 and L5/S1. No fractures or subluxations.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about interpreting a lumbar spine radiograph that shows minor anterolisthesis at L4-L5, retrolisthesis at L1-L2, minimal right lateral listhesis at L3, mild degenerative disc changes at L2-L3, L3-L4, and L4-L5, moderate facet sclerosis at L4-L5 and L5-S1, and no fractures or subluxations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the terminology and radiographic definitions to ensure accurate labeling of the findings. Then, I should verify the clinical significance of these degenerative changes and how often they are incidental. Next, I will correlate the imaging with likely symptom patterns and when to escalate to advanced imaging. After that, I need to check guideline-based management pathways, including when conservative care is appropriate and when surgery is considered. Finally, I will consider special scenarios like osteoporosis screening and dynamic instability, and close with a concise synthesis and next steps anchored to evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislabel anything: anterolisthesis is forward slippage of a vertebra, retrolisthesis is backward slippage, and lateral listhesis is side-to-side displacement. These are forms of spondylolisthesis, which can be degenerative or isthmic, and degenerative spondylolisthesis is common at L4-L5 and often accompanies facet arthrosis and disc degeneration, which fits the reported L4-L5 anterolisthesis and facet sclerosis here [^116kAEtf] [^112Zy5hN].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical significance of these radiographic degenerative changes before I overinterpret them. Multiple high-quality studies show that radiographic lumbar degeneration correlates poorly with pain severity or disability, and degenerative changes are frequently present in asymptomatic individuals, so I should avoid attributing symptoms solely to these findings without clinical correlation [^112BDazu] [^111bG7ni] [^116Jihtn].

> I will now examine the likely symptom correlates and when advanced imaging changes management. Mild degenerative disc changes and facet sclerosis can be associated with mechanical low back pain, whereas more pronounced stenosis or nerve root compression would suggest radiculopathy or neurogenic claudication, for which MRI is the preferred modality to define neural compromise and guide intervention decisions, especially if symptoms persist beyond about 6 weeks despite optimal conservative care or if surgery is being considered [^114NRtGM] [^1151j7Un] [^115Bvxxi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about instability. I initially thought dynamic flexion-extension radiographs might be indicated to assess instability, but wait, I should double-check the evidence — retrospective data show that dynamic films rarely add new clinically actionable information beyond standing AP/lateral views in degenerative spondylolisthesis, and guidelines generally do not recommend routine flexion-extension films unless there is a specific surgical or trauma-related question, so I should correct that impulse and avoid unnecessary dynamic imaging here [^1137gtaG] [^111pFiHX].

> Next, I should review management principles. For nonspecific mechanical low back pain without red flags or progressive neurologic deficits, first-line care is conservative therapy including activity modification, physical therapy, analgesics, and education, and routine lumbar radiography does not improve outcomes or quality of life, so I should emphasize nonoperative care and avoid over-imaging unless new red flags emerge or symptoms persist and intervention is contemplated [^117BSnWs] [^116NpRAS] [^112amh7G].

> But wait, what if the patient has neurogenic claudication or radicular symptoms? In that scenario, I should confirm the diagnosis clinically and then obtain MRI to define central canal, lateral recess, and foraminal stenosis and to correlate with the patient's functional limitations, because MRI best depicts soft tissues and neural elements and guides epidural steroid injections or decompressive surgery when conservative measures fail [^114NRtGM] [^115Bvxxi] [^114ADo8K].

> I need to ensure I'm not missing a surgical indication. Surgery is generally reserved for persistent, function-limiting symptoms with concordant imaging after a reasonable trial of conservative therapy, and in degenerative spondylolisthesis, decompression with or without fusion is considered based on instability and clinical severity, whereas fusion is not routinely indicated for stenosis without instability or deformity, so I should align any surgical referral with both symptom severity and imaging concordance [^112AXDTx].

> Let me consider special scenarios. If the patient is over 50 or has risk factors for osteoporosis, I should consider opportunistic bone density screening from existing radiographs or arrange DXA, because vertebral body morphology and cortical thickness on radiographs can flag low BMD and prompt fracture risk assessment and treatment, and AACE recommends periodic DXA monitoring with consistent machines and sites when osteoporosis is diagnosed or treated [^113z5oe3] [^1124ivTU] [^1143zYuX].

> I should double-check that there are no red flags in the history or exam that would change imaging urgency. In the presence of cancer risk, infection, immunosuppression, severe or progressive neurologic deficits, or cauda equina features, MRI is indicated promptly rather than waiting, so I need to screen for these at each visit and escalate imaging accordingly if they arise [^115gx6pQ].

> In summary, the radiograph shows common age-related degenerative changes with minor alignment variants that are often incidental. Management should remain conservative unless there are progressive neurologic symptoms or persistent, function-limiting pain, in which case MRI is the next step to define neural compromise and guide targeted interventions, and I should avoid routine dynamic films or premature surgical consideration without clinical-imaging concordance [^112BDazu] [^114NRtGM] [^1151j7Un].

Introduction

The lumbar vertebrae, which connect the thoracic vertebrae and sacrum, consist of five vertebrae, known as L1 to L5. The lumbar vertebrae are the largest in the spine, as they play a crucial role in trunk movement and supporting body weight. Structural deformations of the lumbar vertebrae, whether congenital or acquired, can lead to various diseases, the most common of which are adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and spondylolisthesis. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis refers to the lateral curvature of the spine in adolescents aged 10 to 18 years and affects approximately 1 to 3% of adolescents in the USA and 0.5 to 5.2% worldwide. Spondylolisthesis occurs when one vertebra slips forward relative to the vertebra below, and its incidence is approximately 6% in the general population. X-ray, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be employed to diagnose these diseases. Among these modalities, X-rays are frequently used for the initial diagnosis because of their simplicity and cost-effectiveness. Diagnosis has traditionally relied on the manual inspection of X-ray images by medical staff, including radiologists or orthopedists, to identify abnormalities. However, there has been a recent trend towards automating this process to reduce expenses and enhance hospital efficiency.

Lumbar discography — context from proponents and opponents: Proponents argue that discography is the only diagnostic modality that attempts to correlate pathology with symptoms and note that close to two-thirds of asymptomatic subjects have abnormal MRI and CT findings. Opponents argue that the significance of discographic pathology is low, the validity of provoked symptoms is unproven, and fusion outcomes do not correlate with findings, with criticisms citing relative lack of specificity and multiple studies showing false-positive discograms in patients without low back symptoms.

### Radiographic changes in the lumbar intervertebral discs and lumbar vertebrae with age [^112ETCuh]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

Plain lateral radiographs of the lumbar spines of 607 women (age range 20–87 years) and 633 men (age range 20–92 years) were studied.

Objective

To study the radiographic changes in the lumbar intervertebral discs and lumbar vertebrae with age. To compile a database of reference values for the age-dependent height of lumbar discs and concavity index of lumbar vertebral bodies as well as prevalence of vertebral osteophytes by age and sex.

Summary Of Background Data

There is a general agreement that changes induced by aging lead to alterations in the thickness of the disc, but there are differences in the accounts of the effect of aging on the thickness of the lumbar discs. Published methods to measure disc height yield, except for some exceptional cases, inaccurate results. Reference values of disc height and concavity index of lumbar vertebral bodies, suitable for quantitative comparison with a given disc and lumbar vertebral body, have yet to be established.

Methods

Using a new protocol with a precision of 3.9%, the anulus heights of lumbar discs were measured from sets of lateral radiographic views of 607 women and 633 men. The measurement of concavity index of vertebrae was established for each vertebral body by dividing the central vertebral height by the anterior vertebral height.

Results

The heights of lumbar discs T12-L1, L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1 of men and women within the age 20–69 years increased with increasing age (4.6–6.9% in men and 4.7–8.4% in women). The concavity index of vertebrae T12, L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5 of men within age 20–87 years and of women within age 20–92 years decreased linearly with increasing age (0.9–1.5% in men and 1.6–3.2% in women). In other words, the vertebral body endplates became more concave with age. The prevalence of osteophytes was greater in men than in women in lumbar spine and increased with age.

Conclusions

Using the new procedure and the database of reference values, it is possible to measure the height of lumbar discs and concavity of vertebrae objectively and precisely and to compare the results quantitatively with reference values.

### Evidence against the use of lumbar spine radiography for low back pain [^112CsGkf]. Clinical Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Aim

To review abnormalities reported on plain radiographic examination of the lumbar spine in patients referred with low back pain by general practitioners. Additionally, we evaluated and stratified the prevalence of these abnormalities by age. Finally, the diagnostic impact of lumbar spine radiography for the diagnosis of degenerative change, fracture, infection and possible tumour, was modelled.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review of 2007 radiographic reports of patients referred with low back pain for lumbar spine radiography to a large radiology department was performed. The reports were classified into different diagnostic groups and subsequently stratified according to age. The potential diagnostic impact of lumbar spine radiography was modelled by using the prevalence of conditions studied as pre-test probabilities of disease.

Results

The prevalence of reported lumbar spine degeneration increased with age to 71% in patients aged 65–74 years. The overall prevalence of fracture, possible infection, possible tumour was low in our study population: 4, 0.8 and 0.7%, respectively. Fracture and possible infection showed no association with age. Possible tumour was only reported in patients older than 55 years of age.

Conclusion

Although the prevalence of degenerative changes was high in older patients, the therapeutic consequences of diagnosing this abnormality are minor. The prevalence of possible serious conditions was very low in all age categories, which implies radiation exposure in many patients with no significant lesions.

Imaging findings

X-rays

In standard lateral X-rays of the spine the most common finding is the close approximation and contact of adjacent spinous processes with sclerosis of the articulating surfaces. Additionally, in more severe cases there is flattening and enlargement of the articulating surfaces or articulation of the two affected spinous processes (Fig. 1). Furthermore, general degenerative changes in the spine can be seen, usually most prominent at the pathological level. Advantages of radiographic imaging include the low cost and wide availability of the technique and a relatively low ionising radiation dose. On the other hand, there is poor imaging quality especially at the lower lumbar levels of obese patients.

### Guideline update for the performance of fusion procedures for degenerative disease of the lumbar spine. part 10: lumbar fusion for stenosis without spondylolisthesis [^112AXDTx]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Lumbar stenosis is one of the more common radiographic manifestations of the aging process, leading to narrowing of the spinal canal and foramen. When stenosis is clinically relevant, patients often describe activity-related low-back or lower-extremity pain, known as neurogenic claudication. For those patients who do not improve with conservative care, surgery is considered an appropriate treatment alternative. The primary objective of surgery is to reconstitute the spinal canal. The role of fusion, in the absence of a degenerative deformity, is uncertain. The previous guideline recommended against the inclusion of lumbar fusion in the absence of spinal instability or a likelihood of iatrogenic instability. Since the publication of the original guidelines, numerous studies have demonstrated the role of surgical decompression in this patient population; however, few have investigated the utility of fusion in patients without underlying instability. The majority of studies contain a heterogeneous cohort of subjects, often combining patients with and without spondylolisthesis who received various surgical interventions, limiting fusions to those patients with instability. It is difficult if not impossible, therefore, to formulate valid conclusions regarding the utility of fusion for patients with uncomplicated stenosis. Lower-level evidence exists, however, that does not demonstrate an added benefit of fusion for these patients; therefore, in the absence of deformity or instability, the inclusion of a fusion is not recommended.

### Correlation between pre-employment screening X-ray finding of spondylolysis and sickness absenteeism due to low back pain among policemen of the Israeli police force [^111nqFQT]. Spine (2004). Low credibility.

Study Design

A historical prospective case/control study of the significance and correlation between pre-employment findings of L5-S1 spondylolysis and sickness absenteeism due to low back pain among police officers.

Objectives

Examining the importance of pre-employment lumbar spine radiographs as a prediction of work absenteeism.

Summary Of Background Data

Spondylolysis is a defect in the pars interarticularis. Its etiology remains controversial, it is a common condition among young athletes, and it carries genetic predisposition. Although described mostly as an incidental radiographic finding in the adult population, spondylolysis is implicated as a contributing factor to low back pain, although the cause-and-effect relation is not clear.

Methods

One hundred and sixty-nine police officers with L5-S1 spondylolysis were identified out of 3988 examined. Incidence density of sickness absenteeism due to low back pain was calculated for the patients and the controls. The Cox's proportional hazard model was used for comparison between the two groups, controlling for possible confounding variables.

Results

Similar incidence of sickness absenteeism due to low back pain was found among the patients and controls. The total duration of sickness absenteeism, however, was 2.7 times higher in the spondylolysis group than the controls. Prevalence of spondylolysis is origin specific, denoting genetic predisposition to this condition. Total sickness absenteeism not related to low back pain was not significantly different between the two study groups.

Conclusions

There is low predictive value of pre-employment lumbar spine radiograph as a screening tool predicting sickness absenteeism due to low back pain. Spondylolysis, however, may increase the duration of sickness absenteeism in patients with low back pain.

### In vivo 3D tomography of the lumbar spine using a twin robotic X-ray system: quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the lumbar neural foramina in supine and upright position [^113ke5SJ]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Direct and indirect costs of low back pain cause a tremendous financial burden to society. Therefore, cross-sectional examinations of the lumbar spine are common in addition to radiographs. These cross-sectional examinations are generally performed in the supine non weight-bearing position. This is because upright magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners, which allow weight-bearing examinations, are not widely available and weight-bearing computed tomography (CT) examinations are only feasible for the lower extremities, but not for the spine.

It is known that leg pain due to a lumbar foramen stenosis is more pronounced in the upright position. Therefore, radiologic images, obtained in a supine position, do not necessarily represent the true extent of pathology. This discrepancy is a challenge for diagnosis and therapy, especially if clinical symptoms and imaging findings differ. Studies have shown that the size of the lumbar foramina decreases and stenosis increases with weight-bearing. However, these studies were performed either in a seated position or in simulated weight-bearing in supine position by applying axial loading of 40–50% of the body weight with a compressive device — the so-called axial loaded supine MR technique. Also, nearly vertical examinations in an approximately 80° upright position were performed. However, none of these studies assessed the differences of the lumbar foramina in a physiological upright weight-bearing and a supine position. A lately introduced multifunctional X-ray system with a twin robotic X-ray technology enables 3D tomography of the lumbar spine in the supine and upright position. However, only a phantom study, a cadaveric study of the lumbar spine, and in vivo studies of the extremities evaluated the system so far.

The purpose of this study was to quantitatively evaluate lumbar neuroforaminal size differences between the supine non-weight-bearing and the upright weight-bearing positions. Furthermore, an initial assessment of image quality using 3D tomography in comparison with CT of the lumbar spine was perused.

### Normal variation in sagittal spinal alignment parameters in adult patients: an EOS study using serial imaging [^115YDpj5]. European Spine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe normal variations in sagittal spinal radiographic parameters over an interval period and establish physiological norms and guidelines for which these images should be interpreted.

Methods

Data were prospectively collected from a continuous series of adult patients with first-episode mild low back pain presenting to a single institution. The sagittal parameters of two serial radiographic images taken 6-months apart were obtained with the EOS ® slot scanner. Measured parameters include CL, TK, TL, LL, PI, PT, SS, and end and apical vertebrae. Chi-squared test and Wilcoxon Signed Rank test were used to compare categorical and continuous variables, respectively.

Results

Sixty patients with a total of 120 whole-body sagittal X-rays were analysed. Mean age was 52.1 years (SD 21.2). Mean interval between the first and second X-rays was 126.2 days (SD 47.2). Small variations (< 1°) occur for all except PT (1.2°), CL (1.2°), and SVA (2.9 cm). Pelvic tilt showed significant difference between two images (p = 0.035). Subgroup analysis based on the time interval between X-rays, and between the first and second X-rays, did not show significant differences. Consistent findings were found for end and apical vertebrae of the thoracic and lumbar spine between the first and second X-rays for sagittal curve shapes.

Conclusions

Radiographic sagittal parameters vary between serial images and reflect dynamism in spinal balancing. SVA and PT are predisposed to the widest variation. SVA has the largest variation between individuals of low pelvic tilt. Therefore, interpretation of these parameters should be patient specific and relies on trends rather than a one-time assessment.

### Comparison of natural language processing rules-based and machine-learning systems to identify lumbar spine imaging findings related to low back pain [^116e7hxH]. Academic Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate a natural language processing (NLP) system built with open-source tools for identification of lumbar spine imaging findings related to low back pain on magnetic resonance and x-ray radiology reports from four health systems.

Materials and Methods

We used a limited data set (de-identified except for dates) sampled from lumbar spine imaging reports of a prospectively assembled cohort of adults. From N = 178,333 reports, we randomly selected N = 871 to form a reference-standard dataset, consisting of N = 413 x-ray reports and N = 458 MR reports. Using standardized criteria, four spine experts annotated the presence of 26 findings, where 71 reports were annotated by all four experts and 800 were each annotated by two experts. We calculated inter-rater agreement and finding prevalence from annotated data. We randomly split the annotated data into development (80%) and testing (20%) sets. We developed an NLP system from both rule-based and machine-learned models. We validated the system using accuracy metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

Results

The multirater annotated dataset achieved inter-rater agreement of Cohen's kappa > 0.60 (substantial agreement) for 25 of 26 findings, with finding prevalence ranging from 3% to 89%. In the testing sample, rule-based and machine-learned predictions both had comparable average specificity (0.97 and 0.95, respectively). The machine-learned approach had a higher average sensitivity (0.94, compared to 0.83 for rules-based), and a higher overall AUC (0.98, compared to 0.90 for rules-based).

Conclusions

Our NLP system performed well in identifying the 26 lumbar spine findings, as benchmarked by reference-standard annotation by medical experts. Machine-learned models provided substantial gains in model sensitivity with slight loss of specificity, and overall higher AUC.

### Vertebral morphometry [^115RNNia]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Visual semiquantitative (SQ) assessment of the radiographs by a trained and experienced observer is the "gold standard" method to detect vertebral fractures. Vertebral morphometry is a quantitative method to identify osteoporotic vertebral fractures based on the measurement of vertebral heights. Vertebral morphometry may be performed on conventional spinal radiographs (MRX: morphometric x-ray radiography) or on images obtained from dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans (MXA: morphometric x-ray absorptiometry). Vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) indicates the method for identification of the vertebral fractures using lateral spine views acquired by DXA, with low-dose exposition. For epidemiologic studies and clinical drug trials in osteoporosis research but also in clinical practice, the preferred method is radiographic SQ assessment., because an expert eye can better distinguish between true fractures and vertebral anomalies than can quantitative morphometry. However, vertebral morphometry, calculating the deformity of overall thoracic and lumbar spine, may supply useful data about the vertebral fracture risk. VFA performed during routine densitometry allows identification, by visual or morphometric methods, of most osteoporotic vertebral fractures, even those that are asymptomatic.

### Lumbar discography [^113GqehA]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Lumbar discography has generally proven to be a safe diagnostic tool for the evaluation and potential treatment planning of presumed discogenic pain, but it has not been wholeheartedly embraced by the radiologic and surgical community because of doubts as to its safety, accuracy, and relevance to patient outcome. There have been some conflicting reports on the relative merits and limitations of the procedure in the diagnosis and treatment planning of low back pain and radiculopathy; further studies are needed to determine with certainty whether discography is in fact able to localize the precise discs of clinical significance and accurately predict those patients who will respond well to surgery and those who will not.

### Denosumab (Prolia) [^1136Au1g]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Effect on Bone Mineral Density (BMD)

The primary efficacy variable was percent change in lumbar spine BMD from baseline to month 24. An additional key secondary efficacy variable was the incidence of new vertebral fracture through month 36 diagnosed based on x-ray evaluation by two independent radiologists. Lumbar spine BMD was higher at 2 years in Prolia-treated patients as compared to placebo-treated patients [-1.0% placebo, +5.6% Prolia; treatment difference 6.7% (95% CI: 6.2, 7.1); p < 0.0001].

With approximately 62% of patients followed for 3 years, treatment differences in BMD at 3 years were 7.9% (-1.2% placebo, +6.8% Prolia) at the lumbar spine, 5.7% (-2.6% placebo, +3.2% Prolia) at the total hip, and 4.9% (-1.8% placebo, +3.0% Prolia) at the femoral neck. Consistent effects on BMD were observed at the lumbar spine in relevant subgroups defined by baseline age, BMD, and baseline history of vertebral fracture.

Effect on Vertebral Fractures

Prolia significantly reduced the incidence of new vertebral fractures at 3 years (p = 0.0125), as shown in Table 5.

### The canal bone ratio: a novel indicator for opportunistic osteoporosis screening in adult spinal deformity patients through radiographs [^113gcac4]. Spine (2024). Medium credibility.

For patients with ASD, nearly every new patient seen in the spinal clinic undergoes a standard full-spine x-ray. Schwab et al conducted a prospective multicenter study evaluating the relationship between radiographic parameters and disability. The authors identified three parameters most correlated with a disability: sagittal vertical axis, PT, and pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis. As deformity progresses, patients compensate through changes in PT and hip, knee, and ankle joint alignments. The compensatory function of the lower limbs can reduce trunk inclination by threefold. Measurement of spinal pelvic parameters and observation of lower limb alignments are essential for understanding the comprehensive picture of the disease.

Consequently, to meet these needs, the proximal femur is typically visible on full-spine x-rays. In clinical practice, spine surgeons often subjectively assess bone density by observing the sparsity of trabecular bone in the vertebral bodies on lumbar x-ray images. However, this method lacks quantitative precision and is susceptible to variations in radiation dosage and the interference of overlapping fat tissue, leading to lower interobserver reliability. Particularly in ASD patients, especially those with lumbar scoliosis, the visibility of trabecular bone is frequently compromised due to the nature of two-dimensional x-ray projection, influenced by factors such as scoliosis, rotation, and osteophytes. This renders subjective assessment of bone density through x-rays impractical. Nevertheless, measurements of bone morphological parameters offer a remedy to this limitation. Our results indicate that osteoporotic patients have a higher average age and lower BMI than the control group. Studies on the Korean population suggest that a low BMI is one of the risk factors for fragility fractures. Osteoporotic patients exhibited thinner cortical bone on both sides, relatively wider marrow cavities, and larger CBR. In contrast to the findings of Liu et al, we did not observe a correlation between the FNSA and bone density. Although the FNSA has been found to be associated with hip fractures, compensatory mechanisms in the hip and knee joints are common in this specific ASD population. This can lead to the loss of normal anatomical alignment. Consistent with previous research, the osteoporotic group demonstrates lower HUs and higher VBQ scores compared with the control group.

### Appropriate use of lumbar imaging for evaluation of low back pain [^111n62Eb]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Use of lumbar spine imaging, particularly advanced imaging, continues to grow rapidly in the United States. Many lumbar spine imaging tests are obtained in patients who have no clinical symptoms or risk factors suggesting a serious underlying condition, yet evidence shows that this routine imaging is not associated with benefits, exposes patients to unnecessary harms, and increases costs. This article reviews current trends and practice patterns in lumbar spine imaging, direct and downstream costs, benefits and harms, current recommendations, and potential strategies for reducing imaging overuse.

### Extra-spinal incidental findings at lumbar spine MRI in the general population: a large cohort study [^111SdjAC]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

According to epidemiological data in Italy, diagnostic errors are at the basis of 60% of claims against radiologists. A correct reading of MRI scans without missing clinically important IF may prevent not only potentially severe consequences for the patient but also medico-legal implications for the radiologist.

Clinical judgement needs to be exercised in reporting of IF on lumbar spine MRI and guidelines are required to recommend further investigations, especially for subspecialist radiologists not confident with abdominal and pelvic imaging. The introduction of a structured reporting approach to lumbar spine MRI may increase awareness and detection rate of clinically relevant extra-spinal findings. Reporting policies have been addressed from the European Society of Radiology with specific statements on reporting of IF; in the current clinical setting, in fact, the introduction of structured reports and formatted templates could have a profound impact on increasing the detection rate of IF. Guidelines for the advice of further actions to be suggested in the presence of potentially clinically relevant IF may be more difficult to set up; the adoption of multidisciplinary clinico-radiological approaches could enhance the clinical efficacy with a patient-centred and personalised management.

### The "tract" of history in the treatment of lumbar degenerative disc disease [^115tRpBT]. Neurosurgical Focus (2004). Low credibility.

In this paper past, present, and future treatments of degenerative disc disease (DDD) of the lumbar spine are outlined in a straight forward manner. This is done to review previous knowledge of the disease, define current treatment procedures, and discuss future perspectives. An analysis of a subject of this magnitude dictates that one describes as accurate a history as possible: an anatomical/historical "tract" with emphasis on all possible deviations. Although spinal disorders have been recognized for a long time, the view of DDD as a particular disease entity is a more recent development. In this paper, the authors attempt to outline the history of DDD of the lumbar spine in an unbiased and scientific fashion. Physiological, diagnostic, and therapeutic implications will all be addressed in this study.

Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis — diagnosis and imaging consensus notes the clinical presentation spectrum and the importance of history and examination. It is the work group's opinion that obtaining an accurate history and physical examination is important for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. In patients with imaging evidence of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis, reported clinical characteristics include asymptomatic with only occasional back pain; chronic low back pain with or without radicular symptoms and with or without positional variance; radicular symptoms with or without neurologic deficit, with or without back pain; and intermittent neurogenic claudication.

Degenerative changes of the spine may involve the disc space, the facet joints, or the supportive and surrounding soft tissues. MR imaging is ideally suited for delineating the presence, extent, and complications of degenerative spinal disease. Other imaging modalities such as radiography, myelography, and CT may provide complimentary information in selected cases. Percutaneous procedures may be used to confirm that a morphologic abnormality is the source of symptoms. Correlation with clinical and electrophysiologic data is also helpful for accurate diagnosis. Combining the information obtained from imaging studies with the patient's clinical presentation is mandatory for determining the appropriate patient management strategy, especially true in patients afflicted with any condition directly attributed to the degenerative processes of the spine.

### Low back pain [^116Jihtn]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Low back pain — pathoanatomical features and imaging findings emphasize broad potential pain generators and frequent false-positive imaging results. Any innervated lumbar structure can generate symptoms, and false-positive imaging is common, with herniated disc material on CT, MRI, or myelography in 20% to 76% of persons with no sciatica. Among asymptomatic individuals, 32% had "abnormal" lumbar spines, while 47% of those with low back pain had no abnormality identified. Accordingly, the association between clinical complaints and radiological findings must be considered cautiously, and physical job characteristics and psychological aspects of work were more powerful than MRI-identified disc abnormalities in predicting the need for low back pain–related medical consultation.

All patients presenting with signs and symptoms of lumbar radiculopathy must undergo a thorough history taking and physical examination. Often, however, the diagnosis remains unclear; it is accurate anatomically, but the underlying cause of the lesion is not confirmed, or the symptoms are so severe that more information on the anatomy is required. Therefore, the next step in the diagnostic process is imaging studies. This article discusses imaging modalities, including plain radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography (CT), CT myelogram, selective nerve root block, and bone scan.

### Lumbar spine MRI for low back pain: indications and yield [^116i7t8Z]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Low back pain is one of the most common causes of physician visits in the United States with an enormous socioeconomic burden. Because of this burden, numerous studies have focused on its diagnosis and management. New technologies have been quickly adopted with the hope that they will improve our understanding of the physiopathology of the disease and assist us in alleviating patients' pain and discomfort. Unfortunately, previous studies have not been able to show that higher utilization of advanced imaging technology is associated with improvements in patient outcome. This article highlights practices that are evidence-based versus those that are common, or heterogeneous, but not supported by existing evidence. We also highlight outstanding areas for further research.

Conclusion

Clinicians and researchers should be encouraged to follow standardized practices in accordance with evidence-based medicine guidelines. The use of such guidelines will decrease variation in care, allowing researchers to more easily design and conduct comparative effectiveness studies of diagnostic imaging.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^114PSGUR]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Lumbar spine (Fig. 2 A and B)

Hologic Discovery standard has a scan length of 20 cm and a scan width of 11.4 cm. In the analysis the ROI has the same length, but the width is 10.5 cm. The lumbar spine ROI should include the first to fourth lumbar vertebrae. DXA images are generally acquired by the transmission of X-rays from the posterior to anterior direction. They are properly characterized as posterior-anterior (PA) spine scans. Nevertheless, these studies are often called anterior-posterior (AP) spine scans, probably because plain films of the lumbar spine are acquired in the AP projection. Correct and consistent vertebral labeling is essential. The lumbar vertebrae are usually identified by counting from the bottom up, with the iliac crests typically aligned with the L4-L5 intervertebral space. Anatomical variants such as 4 or 6 lumbar vertebrae should be mentioned, if recognisable. The existence of lumbosacral transition vertebrae needs to be considered as a normal anatomic variant and may require a full spine planar radiograph, CT or MRI for correct identification, if specific vertebral labelling verification is needed (e.g. for surgical intervention) and in doubt. Vertebrae affected by local structural changes (e.g. severe osteoarthritic changes, compression fracture, laminectomy) or artifacts (e.g. fusion hardware, vertebroplasty cement, obscured by other implantable devices) are typically excluded. At least two vertebrae should be evaluable for diagnostic classification.

### Facet joint syndrome: from diagnosis to interventional management [^116kAEtf]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Imaging findings (Table 1)

X-ray imaging: Radiographs and computed tomography (CT)

The initial radiographic assessment of patients presenting with lumbar facet-mediated pain includes AP, lateral, and oblique views. Oblique radiographs are the best projections for assessing FJs of the lumbar spine because of their oblique position ("Scottie dog"). Lateral films, however, may provide useful information from the isthmus profile such as the pars interarticularis defect. Because of its ability to provide cross-sectional images and to provide a higher contrast between bony structures, CT improves anatomic evaluation of the FJs and is the preferred method for imaging FJ osteoarthritis. However, standard radiographs can also show pathological changes especially in severe disease. Degeneration is characterized by joint space narrowing, sclerosis, subchondral sclerosis and erosions, cartilage thinning, calcification of the joint capsule, hypertrophy of articular processes and of the ligamentum flavum causing impingement of the foramina and osteophytes. Secondary signs include vacuum joint phenomenon (intra-articular gas), joint effusion and associated degenerative spondylolisthesis. Synovial and subchondral cysts can extend posterior to the FJ but also anterior in the spinal cord or neuroforamen. Kalichman et al. showed 24% of X-rays FJOA before 40 years and 89% in the 60–69 years population, but once again with no correlation between abnormal morphology on radiologic findings and back pain.

### A longitudinal study for incidence of low back pain and radiological changes of lumbar spine in asymptomatic Japanese military young adults [^113F6635]. European Spine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The relation between radiological abnormalities on lumbar spine and low back pain (LBP) has been debated, presumably because of potential biases related to heterogeneity in selection of the subjects, radiological abnormalities at entry, or its cross-sectional observation in nature. Therefore, the aim of this study of a selected population of asymptomatic Japanese Self Defense Forces (JSDF) young adults male with normal lumbar radiographs was to investigate the incidence of newly developed lumbar degenerative changes at middle age and to study their association to LBP.

Subjects and Methods

In 1990, 84 JSDF male military servicemen aged 18 years, without a history of LBP and radiological abnormal findings, were enrolled. After 20 years, 84 subjects were underwent repeated X-ray and completed questionnaires on current LBP and lifestyle factors.

Results

The prevalence of LBP was demonstrated 59%, with 85% of them showing mild pain. Analysis of lumbar radiographs revealed that 48% had normal findings and 52% had degenerative changes. The association between LBP and life style factors was not demonstrated. Lumbar spine in subjects with LBP was more degenerated than in those without. Although disc space narrowing and LBP did not achieve a statistical significance, a significant correlation existed between vertebral osteophyte and LBP in univariate and multivariate analysis (OR 3.0; 95% CI 1.227–7.333).

Discussion and Conclusions

This longitudinal study demonstrated the significant association between vertebral osteophyte and incidence of mild LBP in initially asymptomatic and radiologically normal subjects. These data provide the additional information concerning the pathology of LBP, but further study is needed to clarify the clinical relevance.

### The canal bone ratio: a novel indicator for opportunistic osteoporosis screening in adult spinal deformity patients through radiographs [^113KiyGg]. Spine (2024). Medium credibility.

The appropriate use criteria for lumbar degenerative scoliosis highlight the necessity of weight-bearing spine radiographs and CT/MRI scans when considering surgery. – The Lancet ASD seminar notes advanced imaging like CT scans, CT myelography, MRI, or magnetic resonance angiography are standard in high-income countries but less available in low-income countries. The benefits of stereoradiography over CT or MRI are evident for low-income countries and lower middle-income countries, although its impact on clinical outcomes are still being researched. However, there is currently a lack of methods for quantitatively assessing bone density in ASD patients through x-ray radiographs.

A standing full-spine 36-inch anteroposterior and lateral x-ray is sufficient for a definitive diagnosis and is essential for accurately assessing the overall spinal alignment. To meet the needs of spine surgeons for measuring spinal-pelvic parameters and observing pelvic and lower limb compensation in patients, full-spine x-rays often include the proximal femur. In this scenario, measuring femoral radiographic parameters (CBT and CBR) holds promise as an alternative convenient, and effective opportunistic screening method for osteoporosis without incurring additional costs or exposing the patient to excessive radiation, thereby increasing the detection rate of osteoporosis.

This study aims to (1) investigate whether radiographic parameters measured through full-spine x-rays can be utilized to screen for osteoporosis in ASD patients and (2) compare the predictive performance of CBR, CBT, HUs, and VBQ score for bone density.

### Sagittal balance using position and orientation of each vertebra in an asymptomatic population [^116aitXS]. Spine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Design

A monocentric, retrospective radiographic study with 99 asymptomatic volunteers.

Objective

The authors performed the postural analysis commonly scheduled when evaluating sagittal balance in a vertebra-by-vertebra manner by enrolling an asymptomatic population. They measured the position and angulation of each vertebra to reveal those for which the spatial positioning could be relevant during spinal surgeries.

Summary Of Background Data

Several recent publications detailed the sagittal alignment parameters and focus on global analysis parameters. Some patients with identical commonly evaluated spinal parameters have exhibited very different profiles, with notable differences in vertebral positions and orientations. Therefore, a fine segmental analysis of position of each vertebra could be interest to gain understanding of spine alignment.

Materials and Methods

The authors obtained full-spine EOS x-rays of 99 volunteers in the standard free-standing position. We used a validated three-dimensional reconstruction technique to extract current spinal parameters and the positions and angulations of all vertebrae and lumbar discs. Particular attention was paid to the positions and angulations of the apical and transitional vertebrae in the general population and in subgroups according to pelvic incidence (PI).

Results

T1 was the most common transitional cervicothoracic vertebra (in 89.9% of subjects) and was oriented downwards by an average of 22.0° (SD = 7.3°, minimum = 2.3°, maximum = 40.1°). The thoracic apex trio of T5 (22.2%), T6 (28.3%), and T7 (36.4%) were equally found. The transitional thoracolumbar vertebrae were L1 (39.4%) and T12 (33.3%). The lumbar apex was usually the L3-L4 disc (36.4%). T1 seemed to be the transitional vertebra (90%) irrespective of the PI. For the other relevant vertebrae, the greater the PI, the more cranial the vertebra.

Conclusions

We performed a detailed three-dimensional assessment of overall spinal balance using positional and rotational parameters. The positions and orientations of all vertebrae were specified, particularly the apical and transitional vertebrae.

Lumbar spine BMD was higher at 2 years in denosumab-treated patients as compared to placebo-treated patients [-1.0% placebo, +5.6% denosumab; treatment difference 6.7% (95% CI: 6.2, 7.1); p < 0.0001].

With approximately 62% of patients followed for 3 years, treatment differences in BMD at 3 years were 7.9% (-1.2% placebo, +6.8% denosumab) at the lumbar spine, 5.7% (-2.6% placebo, +3.2% denosumab) at the total hip, and 4.9% (-1.8% placebo, +3.0% denosumab) at the femoral neck. Consistent effects on BMD were observed at the lumbar spine in relevant subgroups defined by baseline age, BMD, and baseline history of vertebral fracture.

Aim

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of degenerative findings on the accuracy of readings obtained by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in patients without osteoporosis.

Methods

Twenty-four female patients who had undergone both DXA and lumbar magnetic resonance imaging were included in the study.

Conclusion

This study has demonstrated that degenerative radiologic changes, especially in the osteophyte area, affect bone mineral density measurements, so degeneration should be considered in the evaluation of this measurement.

### Radiography of the lumbar spine in primary care patients with low back pain: randomised controlled trial [^116NpRAS]. BMJ (2001). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that radiography of the lumbar spine in patients with low back pain is not associated with improved clinical outcomes or satisfaction with care.

Design

Randomised unblinded controlled trial.

Setting

73 general practices in Nottingham, north Nottinghamshire, southern Derbyshire, north Lincolnshire, and north Leicestershire. 52 practices recruited participants to the trial.

Subjects

421 patients with low back pain of a median duration of 10 weeks.

Intervention

Radiography of the lumbar spine.

Main Outcome Measures

Roland adaptation of the sickness impact profile, visual analogue scale for pain, health status, EuroQol, satisfaction with care, use of primary and secondary care services, and reporting of low back pain at three and nine months after randomisation.

Results

The intervention group were more likely to report low back pain at three months (relative risk 1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.60) and had a lower overall health status score and borderline higher Roland and pain scores. A higher proportion of participants consulted their doctor in the three months after radiography (1.62, 1.33 to 1.97). Satisfaction with care was greater in the group receiving radiography at nine but not three months after randomisation. Overall, 80% of participants in both groups at three and nine months would have radiography if the choice was available. An abnormal finding on radiography made no difference to the outcome, as measured by the Roland score.

Conclusions

Radiography of the lumbar spine in primary care patients with low back pain of at least six weeks' duration is not associated with improved patient functioning, severity of pain, or overall health status but is associated with an increase in doctor workload. Guidelines on the management of low back pain in primary care should be consistent about not recommending radiography of the lumbar spine in patients with low back pain in the absence of indicators for serious spinal disease, even if it has persisted for at least six weeks. Patients receiving radiography are more satisfied with the care they received. The challenge for primary care is to increase satisfaction without recourse to radiography.

Lumbar spondylolisthesis is a common finding on plain radiographs. The condition has a variety of causes which can be differentiated on the basis of imaging findings. As the treatment is dependent upon the type of spondylolisthesis, it is important for the radiologist to be aware of these features. We present a pictorial review of the imaging features of lumbar spondylolisthesis and explain the differentiating points between different groups of this disorder. The relative merits of the different imaging techniques in assessing lumbar spondylolisthesis are discussed.

### Diagnosis of osteoporotic vertebral fractures in children [^114c5A1J]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Summary of more recent published studies for vertebral fracture diagnosis in children

*Readability refers to the rate of radiographs/dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scans that were of sufficient quality to be interpretable and was calculated by dividing the number of readable vertebrae for each vertebral level/patient level by each observer (intra-observer) and/or by all observers (inter-observer)

It is essential to have good quality spine radiographs to precisely evaluate vertebral fractures and associated deformities. In order to generate good-quality lateral images, the spine should be as parallel as possible to the radiographic table. Generally, a 100-cm focus-to-film distance should be maintained. For thoracic radiographs, the beam is centred at T7, and for lumbar radiographs, it's centred at L3. With younger children, it is possible to perform the whole spine on a single radiograph where the central beam points to T12. For accurate lateral views, position patients on their left side with flexed knees and hips. Figure 1 shows lateral thoracic and lumbar spine radiographs of an ideally positioned patient.

### An algorithmic approach to treating lumbar spinal stenosis: an evidenced-based approach [^114GkY1G]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with LSS have a history of symptoms that are notable for pain and discomfort that radiate to the lower leg, thigh, and/or buttocks (neurogenic claudication). Patients with more pronounced LSS may develop lower extremity weakness, muscle cramping, numbness, and imbalance in gait. Patients typically report symptoms of neurogenic claudication that abate with sitting down or leaning forward, referred to as the "shopping cart sign". When spinal stenosis predominantly affects the neuroforamen or lateral recess, patients may report radicular pain following a specific dermatomal distribution. As LSS is a slowly progressing condition, rapid onset of these symptoms may refer to a different pathology.

To confirm clinical suspicion of LSS, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) myelogram studies are required. MRI remains the most common imaging modality to assess LSS, as physical examination and x-ray imaging do not have a high sensitivity or specificity. There is great variability in the description and assessment of LSS among radiologists, and lack of standardization may contribute to increased heterogeneity of the patient population undergoing surgery for LSS. However, radiographs are low cost and are readily available. Radiological AP and lateral images may show nonspecific degenerative findings such as disc height loss, disc space narrowing, and osteophyte formation, whereas flexion/extension radiographs may show segmental instability and subtle degenerative spondylolisthesis. Causes that are unrelated to back pain, such as sacroiliac joint pathology, renal stones, or calcified aneurysmal dilatation of the aorta, may also be identified. However, soft tissue evaluation using is limited. MRI has high sensitivity in diagnosing stenosis, as it has high soft tissue contrast, and it best depicts cord, nerve roots, and bone marrow abnormalities. Nevertheless, imaging should be correlated with clinical presentation, as many LSS imaging studies may not have a direct correlation with clinical presentation, and treatment options may vary. The physical findings that are most strongly linked to LSS include wide-based gait, normal Romberg test, thigh pain after 30 seconds of lumbar extension, and neuromuscular deficits. An expert consensus was obtained, which demonstrated an 80% certainty of LSS diagnosis based on seven history items, which include "leg/buttock pain while walking", "flex forward to relieve pain", "relief when using a shopping cart or bicycle", "motor/sensory", "disturbance while walking", "normal/symmetric foot pulses", "lower extremity weakness", and "low back pain". Based on physical examination, it is usually sufficient to diagnose for LSS, and MRI/CT diagnosis is often reserved for patients who are being considered for surgery after conservative management has failed.

Radiographic Findings

The previous edition of the MIST guidelines extensively reviewed the radiographic analysis that is required to evaluate a patient with symptoms of LSS. The radiographic analysis section has been cited by studies since publication, demonstrating the need for a single repository of clinical information on this topic. In the time interval since publication of the previous edition of the MIST guidelines, there have been studies that build upon the foundational descriptive approach used in the radiographic analysis section of that manuscript. Hartman et al, in their technical review, used the necessary interplay between the dynamic flexion/extension film and the combined axial views on CT and MRI to determine optimal evaluation of soft tissue and ligamentous structures vs bony overgrowth in both central and lateral canal stenosis. Their technical report suggests that measurements in the sagittal view alone underestimate lateral stenosis. The authors suggest that measurement in all planes of the axial and sagittal view with both CT and MRI may lead to better preprocedural planning, whether for direct or indirect decompression. In agreement with this approach, a recent study suggested that sagittal radiographic analysis showed a poor correlation with postoperative outcomes.

There is growing evidence suggesting that conventional MRI evaluation may overestimate the lateral recess dimensions in patients with LSS. A small study recently demonstrated that in LSS subjects mean foraminal area decreased by 13% when moving from supine to upright imaging and was further impacted by hyperlordotic positioning (21% reduction in area from supine to hyperlordosis), suggesting that the positioning of maximal symptoms (hyperlordosis) is poorly evaluated by traditional imaging positioning. The superiority of MRI to CT as stand-alone modalities has also been suggested. The concomitant application of standing flexion-extension films in combination with supine MRI evaluation as a predictor of instability is further demonstrated in the study by Lee et al.

As the tools of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning continue to rapidly evolve, imaging analysis and disease detection with imaging hold great promise in the comprehensive evaluation of patients with LSS. A recent study suggested that a deep learning model detected central canal and lateral recess stenosis at a rate comparable to subspecialist radiology evaluation. This technique did have slightly lower detection agreement for foraminal stenosis. This study and others like it suggest that we are nearing an inflection point that may revolutionize the clinical imaging evaluation process. It may be possible to consider the axial/sagittal planes simultaneously across several modalities to determine the true presence of clinically meaningful stenosis.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine: recommendations for acquisition and image evaluation from the BACPAC spine imaging working group [^115gx6pQ]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging modality often used to depict spinal structural abnormalities that may cause low back pain (LBP). With its high soft tissue contrast, MRI allows assessment of multiple structures including intervertebral discs, nerve roots, contents of the central spinal canal, ligaments and facet joints. While MRI is superb at identifying tissue-specific pathology along the spine, the clinical relevance of these findings is often uncertain. Thus, diagnostic MRI for LBP is only recommended in certain patients. The American College of Physicians' guidelines for diagnostic imaging suggest immediate imaging when there are major risks (such as suspicion of cancer, spinal infection, cauda equina syndrome, or presence of severe neurological deficits), but advise deferral of imaging pending a trial of treatment in cases where there are weaker risk factors. Notably, only in a minority of patients can LBP be attributed to a specific pathology (e.g. vertebral fracture or disc herniation with nerve compression), while the great majority of patients are assigned a diagnosis of non-specific LBP (i.e. pain for which the distinct patho-anatomical basis cannot be determined).

Some lumbar MRI findings that are common in patients with LBP are also common in asymptomatic subjects, which makes it difficult to define a causal relationship in individual patients and has led to questions about the diagnostic value of such findings. However, some lumbar MRI findings are more prevalent in patients with LBP than in asymptomatic subjects. Those include bone marrow (BM) lesions located at the vertebral endplates, disc bulges and herniation, and spondylolysis. Such lumbar MRI findings could potentially function as biomarkers that can distinguish patients whose pain is due to a primary nociceptive process in the spine from patients with central modulating mechanisms that can be influenced by a number of psychosocial factors as well as central sensitization (i.e. increased responsiveness of nociceptors to either normal or sub-threshold afferent input, resulting in amplified pain).

A major focus of the Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) Research Program is to advance knowledge of the etiology and treatment of chronic LBP by developing a better understanding of the mechanisms contributing to chronic LBP and by identifying specific therapies that are most effective in identifiable subgroups of patients. The BACPAC Spine Imaging Working Group has developed standard operating procedures (SOPs) for lumbar spine imaging exams to be used in all BACPAC studies. These SOPs include procedures to conduct imaging assessments with guidelines for standardizing the collection, reading/grading, and storage of images across studies and sites within and outside of BACPAC. Our aim was to harmonize imaging protocols and implement a comprehensive evaluation scheme for identifying potential imaging biomarkers of LBP.

### Extraspinal findings on lumbar spine MR imaging [^114nGtJy]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Interpretation of radiologic studies requires vigilance on the part of the radiologist to identify findings and abnormalities outside the region of interest. In the case of routine lumbar spine MRI for low back pain, many extraspinal abnormalities can often be identified. Some of these findings may account for low back pain. Other findings are incidental, but may have significant clinical implications, and are important to recognize. We present twenty-four examples of incidental findings from lumbar spine MRI examinations. The findings involve various organ systems, covering a broad range of clinical urgency.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — monitoring of therapy: Obtain a baseline axial (lumbar spine and hip; 1/3 radius if indicated) dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and repeat DXA every 1 to 2 years until findings are stable, with continued follow-up DXA every 1 to 2 years or at a less frequent interval depending on clinical circumstances (Grade B; BEL 2). Monitor serial changes in lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD); if these sites are not evaluable, monitoring by 1/3 radius site may be acceptable but is limited by a small area and a very large least significant change (LSC) (Grade B; BEL 1, downgraded due to limited evidence). Follow-up should ideally be in the same facility with the same DXA system, adhering to International Society for Clinical Densitometry best practices (Grade C; BEL 2, downgraded due to limited evidence). Consider using bone turnover markers (BTMs) to assess compliance and efficacy; significant reductions in BTMs are seen with antiresorptive therapy and have been associated with fracture reduction, and significant increases indicate good response to anabolic therapy (Grade B; BEL 1, adjusted down due to limited evidence).

Degenerative spondylolisthesis is an anatomic finding, its clinical symptoms are varied, patients can be asymptomatic, and presentations can include back pain, neurogenic claudication and/or radicular pain, with or without axial back pain. The literature also describes position dependent deformities in which the degree of anterior displacement is measurably affected by the posture and position of the patient, though no longitudinal studies have yet addressed this issue.

### Opportunistic screening of low bone mineral density from standard X-rays [^113z5oe3]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis, characterized by loss of bone mineral density (BMD), is underscreened. Osteoporosis and low bone mass are diagnosed by a BMD T-score ≤ -2.5, and between -1.0 and -2.5, respectively, at the femoral neck or lumbar vertebrae (L1–4), using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The ability to estimate BMD at those anatomic sites from standard radiographs would enable opportunistic screening of low BMD (T-score < -1) in individuals undergoing x-ray for any clinical indication.

Methods

Radiographs of the lumbar spine, thoracic spine, chest, pelvis, hand, and knee, with a paired DXA acquired within 1 year, were obtained from community imaging centers (62,023 x-ray-DXA pairs of patients). A software program called Rho was developed that uses x-ray, age, and sex as inputs, and outputs a score of 1 to 10 that corresponds with the likelihood of low BMD. The program's performance was assessed using receiver-operating characteristic analyses in three independent test sets, as follows: patients from community imaging centers (n = 3,729; 83% female); patients in the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (n = 1,780; 71% female); and patients in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (n = 591; 50% female).

Results

The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves were 0.89 (0.87–0.90), 0.87 (0.85–0.88), and 0.82 (0.79–0.85), respectively, and subset analyses showed similar results for each sex, body part, and race.

Conclusion

Rho can opportunistically screen patients at risk of low BMD (at femoral neck or L1–4) from radiographs of the lumbar spine, thoracic spine, chest, pelvis, hand, or knee.

### Degenerative disorders of the lumbar and cervical spine [^117BSnWs]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Degenerative disorders in the spine are normal, age-related phenomena and largely asymptomatic in most cases. Conservative management of lumbar and cervical spondylosis is the mainstay of treatment, and most patients with symptomatic degenerative changes respond appropriately with nonsurgical management. Surgical intervention can be considered an appropriate and viable option when conservative measures have failed. Treatment options should always be directed toward the specific nature and location of the patient's individual pathology. Although current standards in the surgical management of lumbar and cervical degenerative disorders include discectomy, neural decompression, and instrumented spinal arthrodesis, new approaches that address this often-challenging clinical entity are on the horizon.

### A proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of lumbar discogenic pain [^115beesJ]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Our primary objective was to develop a simple, understandable clinical algorithm that can serve as a foundation for physicians to confidently make objective decisions regarding the diagnosis, management and treatment of lumbar discogenic pain throughout the entire clinical course of the condition. In realizing and refining this algorithm, we utilized a modified Delphi methodology whereby a panel of 11 experts in this area were engaged to form a consensus around diagnostic components and characteristics, the full spectrum of treatment options as well as the temporal sequence of interventions with the objective of maximizing clinical benefit and efficiency of care. The algorithm development process was administrated and coordinated by one panel member who aggregated panel member responses. The progression was iterative, commencing with the establishment of the clinical definition of lumbar discogenic pain in June, 2023, followed by an in-person gathering of the expert panel in December, 2023 to further refine key clinical examination features and prioritize the range of interventions. Final input was solicited and collated from the panel members at pain society conferences in July and October, 2024.

Our proposed algorithm recommends a systematic rule set of diagnostic and treatment decisions for lumbar discogenic pain based on unambiguous alternatives and clear stopping rules. A decision tree approach was utilized with "either/or" choices at each branch or node in the algorithm which progresses logically in a temporal fashion (Figure 1). Actions and events are segregated into physical examination assessments, diagnostic procedures and corresponding treatment interventions. Diagnostic and clinical evaluation queries are represented in the algorithm as diamonds, with corresponding symptom severity grading and treatment options shown as rectangles.

Diagnostic and Treatment Algorithm for Lumbar Discogenic Pain.

Published validated standards were employed to grade symptom and radiographic severity as well as assessments of clinical change. Commensurate treatment choices were selected based on published discogenic pain-specific clinical practice guidelines and/or meta-analyses to support each option.

### Association of lumbar spine radiographic changes with severity of back pain-related disability among middle-aged, community-dwelling women [^112BDazu]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are lumbar spine radiographic changes associated with severity of back pain–related disability among middle-aged, community-dwelling women?

Findings

In this population-based cohort study of women from the UK, there was no evidence to support an association between a higher number of lumbar segments with radiographic changes (Kellgren-Lawrence grade, osteophytes, and disc space narrowing) and more severe back pain–related disability in cross-sectional (650 women) or longitudinal (443 women) analyses.

Meaning

The findings suggest that the changes detected on lumbar radiographs provide limited value for decision-making regarding back pain management in this population.

### Diagnostic tests for low back disorders [^116xcjhc]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Diagnostic tests for low back pain (LBP) — imaging and other diagnostic testing: Lumbar spine x-rays are not recommended in patients with LBP without red flags for serious spinal pathology within the first 4 to 6 weeks, and among patients with evidence of radiculopathy, imaging in the acute setting is also not recommended; however, an imaging study may be appropriate when limitations from consistent symptoms have persisted for 1 month or more or when potentially serious pathology or progressive neurologic deficit(s) are concerns. Pretest probability and test characteristics are critical, as lumbosacral spine MRIs are more likely to be "abnormal" by age 40 in normal individuals and herniated discs are not infrequently found in asymptomatic teenagers and young adults; at present, no single imaging modality shows a clear overall advantage, though MRI is superior for soft tissues including intervertebral disc herniations. In the absence of moderate- to high-quality studies, additional diagnostic tests for LBP and spinal conditions are Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I), Low Confidence.

### X-ray examination dose surveys: how accurate are my results? [^115dgVBU]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine the variabilities of dose-area-products (DAP) of frequent X-ray examinations collected for comparison with diagnostic reference levels (DRLs).

Methods

DAP values of chest, abdomen, and lumbar spine examinations obtained on devices from two manufacturers were collected in three centers over 1 to 2 years. The variability of the average DAP results defined as the 95% confidence interval in percentage of their median value was calculated for increasing sample sizes, each examination and center. We computed the sample sizes yielding variabilities lower or equal to 25% and 10%. The effect of narrowing patient selection based on body weight was also investigated (ranges of 67–73 Kg, or 60–80 Kg).

Results

DAP variabilities ranged from 75 to 170% of the median value when collecting small samples (10 to 20 DAP). To reduce this variability, larger samples are needed, collected over up to 2 years, regardless of the examination and center. A variability ≤ 10% could only be reached for chest X-rays, requiring up to 800 data. For the abdomen and lumbar spine, the lowest achievable variability was 25%, regardless of the body weight selection, requiring up to 400 data.

Conclusion

Variabilities in DAP collected through small samples of ten data as recommended by authorities are very high, but can be reduced down to 25% (abdomen and lumbar spine) or even 10% (chest) through a substantial increase in sample sizes. Our findings could assist radiologists and regulatory authorities in estimating the reliability of the data obtained when performing X-ray dose surveys.

Key Points

- Low but reasonable variabilities cannot be reached with samples sized as recommended by regulatory authorities. Higher numbers of DAP values are required to reduce the variability.
- Variabilities of 10% for the chest and 25% for abdomen and lumbar spine examinations are achievable, provided large samples of data are collected over 1 year.
- Our results could help radiologists and authorities interpret X-rays dose surveys.

Bone mineral density (BMD) monitoring — postmenopausal osteoporosis: Ideally, BMD monitoring should occur at the same facility using the same dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) machine, the same technologist if possible, and the same regions of interest for spine and hip; the 1/3 radius site is acceptable when spine and hip sites are not evaluable, whereas other peripheral sites should not be used for monitoring. AACE recommends a repeat DXA 1 to 2 years after initiation of therapy until bone density is stable, with longer intervals between testing when there is continued BMD stability, and significant change is likely to occur earlier at the spine than at the hip. Skeletal status can also be examined by assessing asymptomatic vertebral fractures with repeat X-rays of the thoracic and lumbar spine or VFA.

### The utility of dynamic flexion-extension radiographs in the initial evaluation of the degenerative lumbar spine [^1137gtaG]. Spine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective radiographic review.

Objective

To assess the utility of lateral dynamic flexion-extension radiographs in the initial evaluation of the degenerative lumbar spine.

Summary Of Background Data

Most surgeons obtain standing anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs in the initial evaluation of patients presenting with lumbar complaints. The potential role of dynamic films in this population has not been established.

Methods

Of a 390 radiograph series, 342 met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. After assessment of the AP and lateral radiographs, dynamic films were evaluated to determine if additional information was obtained.

Results

Only 2 of the 342 radiographic series had new findings seen on dynamic films not appreciated on the AP and lateral films (a L3-L4 anterolisthesis of 3 mm with flexion and a L5-S1 retrolisthesis of 4 mm with extension). Fifteen additional radiographic series were noted to have a change in the amount of anterolisthesis or retrolisthesis on the dynamic films (changes ranged from 2 to 5 mm).

Conclusion

In the population studied, dynamic radiographs did not significantly alter the initial course of clinical management beyond standing AP and lateral lumbar images.

### Sacroiliac joint radiographic progression in axial spondyloarthritis is retarded by the therapeutic use of TNF inhibitors: 12-year data from the SCQM registry [^114nDpep]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Given the gap in knowledge concerning radiographic progression and disease-modifying capacities of approved drugs, radiographic assessments were recommended from start of SCQM to be performed every 2 years (anterior-posterior pelvis radiograph, anterior and lateral radiograph of the lumbar spine, lateral radiograph of the cervical spine). The decision to perform radiographs remains with the rheumatologists and the patients. The radiographs are usually ordered in conjunction with an annual visit and are performed either immediately after the visit if the institution has a radiology department or an X-ray equipment or within days/weeks after the visit if the radiographs have to be performed elsewhere. Disease activity measurements were mapped to an X-ray date if available during a timeframe of ± 30 days. A timeframe of 90 days before the X-ray and 30 days after the X-ray was considered for mapping other variables to a specific X-ray date. The visit closest to the X-ray was chosen if several measurements were available during the respective timeframe.

Inclusion criteria

Patients with a clinical diagnosis of axSpA in the SCQM Registry were included in the current study if they fulfilled the ASAS 2009 classification criteria and had at least 2 pelvis radiographs at an interval of 2 years ± 6 months, irrespective of classification status as nr-axSpA or r-axSpA. We used the central reading of pelvis radiographs in the SCQM database for classification purposes and selection of patients ('database scoring'), as it was available to rheumatologists for treatment decisions. This reading was provided by two members of the SCQM axSpA scientific board and a third independent adjudicator as soon as a radiograph was uploaded to the database as a service to the treating rheumatologist.

### Association of lumbar spine radiographic changes with severity of back pain-related disability… [^117D5xuX]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Exposures Primary exposure was lumbar spine radiographic changes, defined using the Kellgren-Lawrence grade. Secondary exposures were defined using presence of osteophytes and disc space narrowing. The composite score combined the number of lumbar spine segments with definite changes detected on radiographic images. Currently, the presence of osteophytes and disc space narrowing are the most frequent changes detected on radiographs that may be indicative of spinal pathologic conditions, and the Kellgren-Lawrence grade is the tool commonly used to assess the severity of osteoarthritis. Good within-observer reproducibility was found.

21 At each lumbar spine segment, disc space narrowing and osteophytes were assessed through the semiquantitative method reported by Lane et al, 22 with grade 0 corresponding to normal, grade 1 to mild narrowing and osteophytes, grade 2 to moderate narrowing and osteophytes, and grade 3 to severe narrowing and osteophytes. The Kellgren-Lawrence grade was summarized as grade 0 indicating normal; grade 1 indicating doubtful narrowing of disc space and possible osteophytic lipping; grade 2 indicating definite osteophyte and possible narrowing of disc space; grade 3 indicating moderate multiple osteophytes, definite narrowing of disc space, some sclerosis, and possible deformity of bone contour; and grade 4 indicating large osteophytes, marked narrowing of disc space, severe sclerosis, and definite deformity of bone contour.

The composite score was then calculated as the final L1-L2 score + L2-L3 score + L3-L4 score + L4-L5 score, with values ranging from 0 to 4. The K-L grade–based score was defined as the primary exposure. Osteophyte and disc space narrowing grade–based scores were set as secondary exposures.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis [^112xKEfG]. The Spine Journal (2016). Medium credibility.

Levels of evidence and grades of recommendation — NASS methodology defines levels of evidence from Level I (high quality randomized controlled trial) to Level V (expert consensus) and ties grades of recommendation to the quality of evidence. Grades of Recommendation are: A (Good evidence [Level I studies with consistent findings]), B (Fair evidence [Level II or III studies with consistent findings]), C (Poor quality evidence [Level IV or V studies]), and I (Insufficient or conflicting evidence not allowing a recommendation for or against intervention). Recommendations are then graded based upon the level of evidence and use standard language in which A recommendations indicate a test or intervention is "recommended", B recommendations "suggest" a test or intervention, C recommendations indicate a test or intervention "may be considered" or "is an option", and I statements clearly indicate that "there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against" a test or intervention; when evidence is lacking, work group consensus statements state that "In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the work group's opinion that" a test or intervention may be appropriate.

### Systematic approach to interpretation of the lumbar spine MR imaging examination [^113wWJFE]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

The lumbar spine MR imaging study is one of the most frequently ordered MR imaging examinations in the United States. Numerous possible causes exist for low back pain, which contributes to the diagnostic challenge that imagers face in arriving at clinically relevant diagnoses from the anatomic information provided by MR imaging. In this article, the authors suggest a systematic approach to MR imaging interpretation. The evaluation may be altered, based on individual preferences and the specific clinical scenario. The author also highlights commonly encountered disease processes, pertinent MR imaging anatomy, and some common diagnostic pitfalls. Normal and abnormal spine MR images are also shown.

### Guideline update for the performance of fusion procedures for degenerative disease of the lumbar spine. part 6: discography for patient selection [^116TSGp5]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Identifying the etiology of pain for patients suffering from chronic low-back pain remains problematic. Noninvasive imaging modalities, used in isolation, have not consistently provided sufficient evidence to support performance of a lumbar fusion. Provocative testing has been used as an adjunct in this assessment, either alone or in combination with other modalities, to enhance the diagnostic capabilities when evaluating patients with low-back pain. There have been a limited number of studies investigating this topic since the publication of the original guidelines. Based primarily on retrospective studies, discography, as a stand-alone test, is not recommended to formulate treatment strategies for patients with low-back pain. A single randomized cohort study demonstrated an improved potential of discoblock over discography as a predictor of success following lumbar fusion. It is therefore recommended that discoblock be considered as a diagnostic option. There is a possibility, based on a matched cohort study, that an association exists between progression of degenerative disc disease and the performance of a provocative discogram. It is therefore recommended that patients be counseled regarding this potential development prior to undergoing discography.

### Development and validation of a feature-based broad-learning system for opportunistic osteoporosis screening using lumbar spine radiographs [^1124ivTU]. Academic Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

Osteoporosis is primarily diagnosed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA); yet, DXA is significantly underutilized, causing osteoporosis, an underdiagnosed condition. We aimed to provide an opportunistic approach to screen for osteoporosis using artificial intelligence based on lumbar spine X-ray radiographs.

Materials and Methods

In this institutional review board-approved retrospective study, female patients aged ≥ 50 years who received both X-ray scans and DXA of the lumbar vertebrae, in three centers, were included. A total of 1180 cases were used for training and 145 cases were used for testing. We proposed a novel broad-learning system (BLS) and then compared the performance of BLS models using radiomic features and deep features as a source of input. The deep features were extracted using ResNet18 and VGG11, respectively. The diagnostic performances of these BLS models were evaluated with the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity.

Results

The incidence rate of osteoporosis in the training and test sets was 35.9% and 37.9%, respectively. The radiomic feature-based BLS model achieved higher testing AUC (0.802 vs. 0.654 vs. 0.632, both P = 0.002), sensitivity (78.2% vs. 56.4% vs. 50.9%), and specificity (82.2% vs. 74,4% vs. 75.6%) than the two deep feature-based BLS models.

Conclusion

Our proposed radiomic feature-based BLS model has the potential to expand osteoporosis screening to a broader population by identifying osteoporosis on lumbar spine X-ray radiographs.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^115rvg2C]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis and treatment of low back pain — imaging recommendations emphasize evidence gaps and research needs: For contrast enhanced imaging indications based on history and clinical presentation, for imaging the lumbar spine in an oblique plane, and for the value of flexion/extension films in evaluating lower back pain, "A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question". The work group recommends that future imaging studies relative to low back pain (LBP) include subgrouping of relevant populations, and recommends a prospective study evaluating patients with and without nonspecific low back pain.

### Sagittal alignment in the degenerative lumbar spine: surgical planning [^112REc77]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
Two examples of L5 vertebral body shapes that could factor into restoring segmental lordosis. The yellow lines indicate L5 vertebral end plates.

Although the prior argument emphasizes the importance of sagittal alignment in the degenerative spine, alignment itself is not an indication for surgical intervention. Patients' physical examination, symptomology, and clinical correlation of radiographic findings to patient-reported outcome measures remain the first line to indicate patients for a surgical procedure. Therefore, it is imperative to note that we do not encourage fusing additional segments to optimize the sagittal plane, but rather encourage a critical analysis of segmental lordosis throughout the lumbar spine and an aim of restoring the surgically indicated levels to the normative targets. Figure 4 illustrates 3 types of degenerative spine conditions; note the associated loss of segmental lordosis, cephalad or caudal, and hyperlordotic compensation in adjacent segments -.

Fig. 4
Three types of degenerative lumbar disease from a sagittal alignment standpoint: loss of lordosis in caudal segments (Fig. 4-A), cephalad segments (Fig. 4-B), and globally throughout the lumbar spine (Fig. 4-C). L2-L3 and L3-L4 compensatory hyperlordosis is noted in Figure 4-A, L2-L3 decompensation (rotational failure) and L5-S1 compensatory hyperlordosis are noted in Figure 4-B, and no compensation due to regional degeneration (red oval) is noted in Figure 4-C.

### Radiologic examination of the lumbosacral spine… [^113kXAH6]. stacks.cdc.gov (2017). Low credibility.

Radiologic examination of the lumbosacral spine. Public Domain 1978/06/01 By Gilula L File Language: Details Personal Author: Description: The radiographic anatomy of the normal spine was described in reference to the radiography of congenital and acquired abnormalities affecting the lumbosacral spine. Radiographic views for normal examination of the lumbosacral area included anteroposterior, lateral, both obliques, detailed laterals of the L5 to S1 disc space, and an anteroposterior up angled view profiling the L5 to S1 space. Positions used for stress examinations included lateral flexion and extension and anteroposterior lateral bending.

Congenital abnormalities described included spina bifida occulta, hemivertebra, and unfused inferior articular facet apophysis; and the acquired abnormalities presented were Schmorl's nodes, degenerative conditions of the spine, disc space infection, spondylolisthesis, isthmus defects, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, and ankylosing spondylitis. The recognition of old fractures and primary neoplasms in the radiographic examination of the vertebral column was also discussed.

### A rapid method to identify lumbarization on lumbar spine radiography and computed tomography [^117K3WAp]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background Context

Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (LSTV) are very common congenital spinal anomalies that consist of sacralization of the lowest lumbar vertebra or lumbarization of the uppermost sacral vertebra. They are a main cause of wrong-level surgery.

Purspose

This study aimed to explore morphological characteristics which can help to rapidly identify LSTV on lumbar spine radiography and computed tomography.

Study Design

Retrospective, case-control study.

Outcome Measures

(1) Anterior superior angle (ASA) of the last presacral vertebra (PSV)-the angle between the anterior edge and superior endplate of the last PSV on a mid-sagittal lumbar CT view; (2) Posterior angle (PA) of the last PSV and the first sacral vertebra-the angle between the posterior edge of the last PSV and the posterior edge of the uppermost sacral-type segment on a mid-sagittal lumbar CT view; (3) Location of the iliac crest line (ICL) on AP whole-spine image-it was defined based on its location with respect to the transverse processes of the vertebra above the last PSV. An ICL higher than the inferior edges of the transverse process of the vertebra above the last PSV was defined as high ICL.

Patient Sample

Data of all patients, who underwent lumbar computed tomography (CT) and whole-spine radiography for lumbar spinal stenosis or lumbar disc herniation, at a single institution from 2017 to 2023, were analyzed from the local database.

Methods

Data of 909 patients were grouped according to lumbosacral anatomy as follows: lumbarization of the first sacral vertebra (LZ), sacralization of the fifth lumbar vertebra (SZ), and normal spine (control). The anterior superior angle (ASA) of the last PSV, posterior angle (PA) of the last PSV and the first sacral vertebra, and location of the iliac crest line (ICL) on AP whole-spine imaging were measured. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess the diagnostic performance of the measurements (ASA; PA; ICL; ASA and PA; ASA, PA, and ICL). Inter- and intra-observer reliabilities of each measurement were assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).

Results

LSTV were present in 105 patients (11.6%): LZ in 76 (8.4%) and SZ in 29 (3.2%). ASA of the last PSV (85.7° ± 4.1° vs. 90.6° ± 2.9°; P < 0.001) and PA of the last PSV and the first sacral vertebra (19.7° ± 14.2° vs. 36.9° ± 9.1°; P < 0.001) were significantly lower in the LZ group than the control group. The prevalence of a high ICL was significantly higher in the LZ group than the control group (36.8% vs. 0.9%; P < 0.001). Mean ASA and PA and prevalence of high ICL were 90.1° ± 2.6°, 32.6° ± 11.4°, and 6.9%, respectively, in the SZ group; corresponding values in the control group were 90.6° ± 2.9°, 36.9° ± 9.1°, and 0.9%, respectively. The differences were not significant. Among the 37 patients with a high ICL, 30 (81.1%) also had an LZ. Twenty-three of the 24 patients (95.8%) with both a high ICL and PA < 20° had an LZ. ASA, PA, and ICL combined demonstrated excellent or good performance in differentiating patients in the LZ group from those in the control group (area under the ROC curve = 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–0.96) and from those in the SZ group (area under the ROC curve = 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–0.92).

Conclusions

Lumbarization can be identified on lumbar spine imaging using a rapid method. When the ICL is high and both the ASA and PA are small on lumbar imaging, whole-spine radiography is recommended to definitively identify if lumbarization is present.

### Association of lumbar spine radiographic changes with severity of back pain-related disability among middle-aged, community-dwelling women [^112kg4DF]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Considering that the number of lumbar spine segments with radiographic changes detected and the various types of radiographic changes might be associated with the results, we generated 3 composite scores: a K-L grade–based score, an osteophyte grade–based score, and a disc space narrowing grade–based score; at each segment, a binary exposure variable of 1 (K-L grade ≥ 2, which means at least definite osteophyte and possible narrowing of disc space are present; disc space narrowing and osteophyte grade ≥ 1, which means at least mild or definite changes are present) vs 0 (K-L grade 0 or 1; disc space narrowing and osteophyte grade 0) was used. The composite score was then calculated as the final L1-L2 score + L2-L3 score + L3-L4 score + L4-L5 score, with values ranging from 0 to 4 (where 0 indicates no lumbar spine segments with radiographic changes detected and 4 indicates 4 lumbar spine segments with radiographic changes detected). The K-L grade–based score was defined as the primary exposure. Osteophyte and disc space narrowing grade–based scores were set as secondary exposures.
