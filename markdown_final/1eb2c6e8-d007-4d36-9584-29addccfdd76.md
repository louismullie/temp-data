## Question

Can terbutaline cause tachycardia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether terbutaline causes tachycardia and how strong the evidence is for a heart rate–increasing effect. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanism and whether beta-2 selectivity truly spares the heart. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling and high-credibility sources explicitly state about cardiovascular effects. Next, I will review clinical studies for quantitative changes in heart rate and dose-response. After that, I should assess overdose data and special populations or drug interactions that amplify risk. Finally, I will compare terbutaline with other beta-agonists and synthesize practical clinical implications for monitoring and risk mitigation.

> Let me consider the mechanism first. At first glance, I might think that a "beta-2 selective" agent would have minimal chronotropic effect because beta-1 receptors dominate in the heart, but wait, let me verify whether beta-2 receptors are present in cardiac tissue. The FDA pharmacology summary notes a meaningful population of beta-2 receptors in the human heart — on the order of 10% to 50% — and acknowledges that the usual sympathomimetic cardiovascular effects have been observed with terbutaline, making a direct cardiac effect mechanistically plausible via adenyl cyclase/cAMP signaling that increases sinus node automaticity and conduction [^notfound].

> Next, I should review direct regulatory statements. The FDA labeling for terbutaline cautions that, like other beta-agonists, it can produce clinically significant cardiovascular effects as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and symptoms, and it specifically lists sinus tachycardia as a common adverse reaction, while palpitations are very common, which often track with rate elevation in practice; this is corroborated in structured SPL safety listings for both oral and subcutaneous products, reinforcing that tachycardia is an expected on-target effect at therapeutic doses in a subset of patients [^113mY8g2] [^1148xogD] [^113dAR3G] [^113wKtfW].

> I will now examine quantitative clinical data to gauge the magnitude and timing of heart rate changes. In a pediatric ICU series using continuous IV terbutaline for severe asthma, heart rates rose approximately 9% to 13% above baseline shortly after initiation and returned toward baseline after stopping the infusion, consistent with a reversible pharmacodynamic effect; in dialysis patients treated with weight-based subcutaneous terbutaline for hyperkalemia, the mean peak heart rate increase was about 26 bpm, again aligning with beta-agonist physiology; in type 1 diabetes, bedtime oral terbutaline demonstrated a dose-dependent rise in morning heart rate from about 78 to 82 to 88 bpm across placebo, 2.5 mg, and 5.0 mg, respectively; and meta-analytic data across beta-agonists show an average single-dose heart rate increase of roughly 9 bpm versus placebo, supporting a class effect that includes terbutaline [^112Yp2YQ] [^115mGi9x] [^1132Nt6j] [^114N5Wqd].

> Hold on, I should verify dose-response and what happens in overdose to understand clinical ranges. The FDA overdose section explicitly anticipates tachycardia that can reach up to 200 beats per minute with excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation, which makes sense given escalating receptor occupancy and systemic spillover at higher exposures; additionally, pharmacology reviews highlight that tachycardia is a predictable, dose-related effect of short-acting beta-agonists, fitting well with the observed clinical gradients across studies and real-world reports [^115BzTi9].

> Next, I should review risk modifiers and special populations. Let me first confirm label cautions: terbutaline should be used carefully in patients with cardiovascular disease, especially coronary insufficiency, arrhythmias, or hypertension, because rate increases and ECG changes can be clinically significant in these groups; in pregnancy, multiple FDA communications warn of maternal adverse effects including increased heart rate and arrhythmias with tocolytic use, and coadministration with non–potassium-sparing diuretics can acutely worsen hypokalemia and ECG changes, potentially amplifying tachycardia or arrhythmic risk, so I need to ensure these context factors are considered when counseling or monitoring patients [^111GFWwh] [^114sh5zH] [^117PFzWL] [^112a31qd].

> But wait, what if terbutaline is not unique among beta-agonists and the risk is simply class-related; does comparative data suggest any relative differences. A review of formoterol safety indicates smaller impacts on pulse and QT metrics compared with terbutaline under comparable conditions, implying that terbutaline may exert relatively greater chronotropic effects in some settings, while the albuterol label mirrors class cautions about cardiovascular effects, reinforcing that tachycardia is a class phenomenon with molecule- and dose-dependent variability that still clearly includes terbutaline [^1144stZ4] [^113MK7dL].

> Let me now synthesize and confirm the clinical takeaway. Based on mechanistic plausibility, high-credibility labeling, and convergent clinical data, terbutaline can and does cause tachycardia in a dose-related fashion, commonly in the 1% to 10% range at therapeutic dosing with palpitations reported more frequently, with larger heart rate increases observed at higher systemic exposure or in vulnerable contexts; given label cautions, I need to ensure monitoring is individualized, particularly in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, pregnancy contexts, or concurrent diuretic-induced hypokalemia, and if clinically significant supraventricular tachycardia emerges, standard rate-control strategies per guideline-directed therapy may be considered based on hemodynamic stability and comorbidities [^1148xogD] [^113dAR3G] [^113wKtfW] [^111GFWwh].

Terbutaline causes **tachycardia** by stimulating cardiac β1-adrenergic receptors and increasing sympathetic tone [^112UuXuU] [^114iMkH6]. Tachycardia is a **common adverse effect** with all routes [^1148xogD] [^113dAR3G], especially at higher doses or with rapid IV/SC administration [^115BzTi9] [^112Yp2YQ]. The risk is higher in patients with cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, or when combined with other sympathomimetics or non–potassium-sparing diuretics [^111GFWwh] [^112a31qd]. Clinicians should monitor heart rate and use caution in at-risk patients.

---

## Pharmacological mechanism underlying tachycardia

Terbutaline is a selective β2-adrenergic agonist that relaxes bronchial smooth muscle via cAMP signaling [^112UuXuU]. However, **cardiac β1 stimulation** increases heart rate and contractility [^114iMkH6], and β2-mediated vasodilation with reflex sympathetic activation further augments heart rate [^111GFWwh].

---

## Clinical evidence of terbutaline-induced tachycardia

Multiple studies and reports **confirm terbutaline-induced tachycardia**:

- **Pediatric asthma**: Continuous IV terbutaline increased heart rate by 9–13% above baseline [^112Yp2YQ], returning to below baseline within 1 hour after stopping.

- **Hyperkalemia**: SC terbutaline increased heart rate by a mean 25.8 ± 10.5 bpm [^115mGi9x] (P < 0.001).

- **Overdose**: Tachycardia up to 200 bpm [^115BzTi9] is reported with excessive dosing.

---

## Incidence and severity of tachycardia

Tachycardia is a **common adverse effect** of terbutaline; incidence and severity vary by dose, route, and patient factors:

| **Route of administration** | **Incidence of tachycardia** | **Severity** |
|-|-|-|
| Oral | Common (1–10%) [^1148xogD] | Mild to moderate |
| Subcutaneous | Common (1–10%) [^113dAR3G] | Mild to moderate |
| Intravenous (overdose) | - Very common <br/> - Severe [^115BzTi9] | Severe (up to 200 bpm) |

---

## Patient populations at increased risk

Certain populations are at **higher risk** of terbutaline-induced tachycardia:

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Coronary insufficiency, arrhythmias, hypertension [^111GFWwh].

- **Hyperthyroidism**: Increased sensitivity to sympathomimetics [^111GFWwh] [^113mY8g2].

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Risk of hypokalemia and hyperglycemia.

- **Pregnancy**: Maternal and fetal tachycardia reported [^114sh5zH].

---

## Dose-dependence and route of administration

Tachycardia is **dose-dependent** [^114N5Wqd] and more pronounced with higher doses or rapid IV/SC administration [^115BzTi9]; oral or inhaled routes generally cause milder effects [^112UuXuU] [^114iMkH6].

---

## Clinical management and monitoring

For **clinicians**, the following actions are recommended:

- **Monitor heart rate**: Regularly during therapy [^111GFWwh].

- **Adjust dose**: Reduce or stop if significant tachycardia occurs [^115BzTi9].

- **Use caution**: In patients with cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes [^113mY8g2].

- **Avoid interactions**: With other sympathomimetics or non–potassium-sparing diuretics [^112a31qd].

---

## Comparison with other beta-agonists

Terbutaline's tachycardia risk is **similar to that of other short-acting β2-agonists** (e.g. albuterol) [^113MK7dL], though individual susceptibility and dosing influence severity [^114iMkH6].

---

## Long-term cardiovascular implications

Chronic use may increase cardiovascular event risk [^114N5Wqd], particularly in patients with preexisting disease. Long-term safety data are limited; therefore, **caution is advised**.

---

Terbutaline commonly causes **tachycardia** via β1 stimulation and sympathetic activation [^112UuXuU]; risk rises with higher doses, rapid IV/SC administration, and in susceptible patients [^115BzTi9]. Clinicians should monitor heart rate, adjust dosing, and use caution in at-risk populations [^111GFWwh].

### Terbutaline sulfate [^111GFWwh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Deterioration of asthma: Asthma may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If the patient needs more doses of terbutaline sulfate than usual, this may be a marker of destabilization of asthma and requires reevaluation of the patient and the treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for anti-inflammatory treatment, e.g. corticosteroids.

Use of anti-inflammatory agents: The use of beta-adrenergic agonist bronchodilators alone may not be adequate to control asthma in many patients. Early consideration should be given to adding anti-inflammatory agents, e.g. corticosteroids.

Cardiovascular effects: Terbutaline sulfate, like all other beta-adrenergic agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. Although such effects are uncommon after administration of terbutaline sulfate at recommended doses, if they occur, the drug may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Therefore, terbutaline sulfate, like all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.

Seizures: There have been rare reports of seizures in patients receiving terbutaline.

### Adverse effects of beta-agonists [^114iMkH6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Short-acting beta-adrenergic receptor agonists have pharmacologically predictable dose-related and potency-related adverse effects, including tachycardia and tremor; they also affect serum potassium and glucose. These effects all show tolerance with continued exposure. The potential for arrhythmia is increased by comorbidity and hypoxemia.

Nonpharmacologically predictable effects include airway hyperresponsiveness to nonspecific and specific stimuli, such as allergens and exercise, and increased airway inflammation. Genetic variants of the beta-adrenergic receptor alter susceptibility to adverse effects of beta-agonists on airway function. The impact of the enantiomers of beta-agonists on adverse effects remains unclear.

The two epidemics of asthma deaths among young people were temporally associated with the introduction of potent short-acting beta-agonists (isoproterenol and fenoterol) and appear to be related to adverse effects of these drugs on airway function and airway hyperresponsiveness, rather than to cardiotoxicity. Compared with short-acting agents, long-acting beta-agonists show similar but less pronounced pharmacologically predictable effects, and they have not been shown to increase airway hyperresponsiveness in adults. Postmarketing surveillance studies have not suggested significant adverse effects of long-acting beta-agonists on morbidity and mortality.

### Terbutaline sulfate [^112a31qd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Beta-blockers**: Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as terbutaline sulfate, but may produce severe bronchospasm in asthmatic patients. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, such as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with asthma. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.

- **Diuretics**: The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non-potassium sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the co-administration of beta-agonists with non-potassium sparing diuretics.

- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility**: In a 2-year study in Sprague-Dawley rats, terbutaline sulfate caused a significant and dose-related increase in the incidence of benign leiomyomas of the mesovarium at dietary doses of 50 mg/kg and above (approximately 25 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose for adults on a mg/m² basis). In a 21-month study in CD-1 mice, terbutaline sulfate showed no evidence of tumorigenicity at dietary doses up to 200 mg/kg (approximately 55 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose for adults on a mg/m² basis).

### Subcutaneous terbutaline use in CKD to reduce potassium concentrations [^115mGi9x]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Acute hyperkalemia is a frequent and potentially life-threatening medical problem in patients on maintenance hemodialysis therapy. Beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) stimulation causes potassium cellular influx and a decline in plasma potassium concentrations. Therefore, betaAR agonists are used in the treatment of patients with hyperkalemia. The goal of this study is to evaluate the utility of weight-based subcutaneous terbutaline dosing to reduce plasma potassium concentrations in a group of subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) requiring hemodialysis.

- **Methods**: Fourteen subjects with CKD receiving long-term hemodialysis were administered terbutaline, 7 microg/kg, subcutaneously. Heart rate measurements and blood samples for potassium concentration determinations were made serially for 420 minutes. Effects of terbutaline on heart rate and potassium responses were determined in each subject.

- **Results**: Terbutaline significantly reduced plasma potassium concentrations and significantly increased heart rates during the time course of the study (P < 0.001, repeated-measures analysis of variance). Mean reduction in peak potassium concentration (-1.31 ± 0.5 [SD] mEq/L) and increase in peak heart rate (25.8 ± 10.5 beats/min) were significantly different from baseline (P < 0.001, baseline versus peak for both responses). No subject reported significant adverse effects.

- **Conclusion**: Administration of subcutaneous terbutaline obviates the need for intravenous access and should be considered as an alternative to nebulized or inhaled beta-agonists to treat acute hyperkalemia.

### Albuterol [^113MK7dL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Albuterol, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, particularly those with coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. It should also be used cautiously in patients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus, and in patients who are unusually sensitive to sympathomimetic amines. Clinically significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure have been observed in some patients and could be expected to occur after using any beta-adrenergic bronchodilator.

Large doses of intravenous albuterol have been documented to exacerbate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis. Similar to other beta-agonists, albuterol may cause significant hypokalemia in certain patients, potentially through intracellular shunting, which could lead to adverse cardiovascular effects. Typically, the decrease in potassium levels is transient and does not require supplementation.

- **Information for patients**: The action of albuterol tablets may last up to 8 hours or longer. Albuterol tablets should not be taken more frequently than recommended. Do not increase the dose or frequency of albuterol tablets without consulting your physician. If treatment with albuterol tablets becomes less effective for symptomatic relief, your symptoms worsen, and/or you need to take the product more frequently than usual, you should seek medical attention immediately. While taking albuterol tablets, other asthma medications and inhaled drugs should only be taken as directed by your physician. Common adverse effects include:

### Beta(2) adrenergic receptors mediate important electrophysiological effects in human ventricular myocardium [^115Y4JpC]. Heart (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to define the effects of beta(2) adrenergic receptor stimulation on ventricular repolarization in vivo. The research was conducted using a prospective study design at a tertiary referral center. The study involved 85 patients with coronary artery disease and 22 normal controls.

Interventions included the administration of intravenous and intracoronary salbutamol, a beta(2) adrenergic receptor selective agonist, at doses of 10–30 microg/min and 1–10 microg/min, respectively. Additionally, intravenous isoprenaline, a mixed beta(1)/beta(2) adrenergic receptor agonist, was infused at 1–5 microg/min during fixed atrial pacing.

- **Main outcome measures**: QT intervals, QT dispersion, and monophasic action potential duration were the key measures.

- **Results**: In patients with coronary artery disease, salbutamol decreased QT(onset) and QT(peak), but increased QT(end) duration; the QT(onset)-QT(peak) and QT(peak)-QT(end) intervals increased, resulting in T wave prolongation (mean (SEM): 201 (2) ms to 233 (2) ms; p < 0.01). Dispersion of QT(onset), QT(peak), and QT(end) showed a large increase, which was more pronounced in patients with coronary artery disease. For example, QT(end) dispersion in controls was 50 (2) ms at baseline versus 98 (4) ms with salbutamol, whereas in coronary artery disease patients, it was 70 (1) ms at baseline versus 108 (3) ms with salbutamol (p < 0.001). Similar responses were observed with isoprenaline. Monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarization shortened during intracoronary infusion of salbutamol from 278 (4.1) ms to 257 (3.8) ms (p < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: Beta(2) adrenergic receptors mediate important electrophysiological effects in human ventricular myocardium. The increase in dispersion of repolarization provides significant insights into the underlying electrophysiological changes.

### Safety of terbutaline for treatment of acute severe pediatric asthma [^112Yp2YQ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Use of continuous intravenous terbutaline treatment in severe asthma attacks has been hampered by the lack of well-powered clinical trials where effects of such treatment are described in detail. Here, we aimed to provide a descriptive report on the largest cohort of severe pediatric asthma patients treated with terbutaline.

- **Methods**: The study was conducted in a pediatric intensive care unit in a large metropolitan tertiary care university hospital on 124 patients receiving terbutaline infusion. To stratify the effect of, and determine any age-related differences of, terbutaline, the patients were divided into three age groups (0–6 years, 7–12 years, and 13–18 years). Clinical response and the potential harmful effects of terbutaline infusion were determined.

- **Results**: There were significant reductions in systolic (varying between 86% and 93% of the baseline) and diastolic blood pressures (varying between 74% and 86% of the baseline level). However, the values returned to baseline level shortly after discontinuation of infusion. Terbutaline increased heart rates in all groups shortly after initiation (9%-13% above baseline), which returned to below baseline levels one hour after discontinuation. Serum potassium levels were also reduced in all patients compared to their baseline values after initiation of terbutaline infusion; however, none of the subjects required potassium replacement.

- **Conclusions**: The results indicate that overall, terbutaline infusion was well tolerated without irreversible adverse effects of the treatment. Although hemodynamic and metabolic changes occurred, they were not deemed harmful in the long term.

### Terbutaline sulfate [^115BzTi9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Overdosage**: The median subcutaneous lethal dose of terbutaline sulfate in mature rats is approximately 165 mg/kg, which is about 90 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose for adults on an mg/m² basis. In young rats, the median subcutaneous lethal dose is approximately 2000 mg/kg, translating to roughly 1100 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose for adults on an mg/m² basis.

The expected symptoms of overdosage involve excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation or an exaggeration of any symptoms listed under adverse reactions, such as:

- **Cardiovascular symptoms**: seizures, angina, hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats per minute, arrhythmias, palpitation
- **Neurological symptoms**: nervousness, headache, tremor, dizziness, malaise, insomnia
- **Other symptoms**: dry mouth, nausea, fatigue

Hypokalemia may also occur.

There is no specific antidote. Treatment involves the discontinuation of terbutaline sulfate along with appropriate symptomatic therapy. Consideration may be given to the judicious use of a cardioselective beta-receptor blocker, with caution regarding the potential for bronchospasm. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to ascertain if dialysis is beneficial for terbutaline sulfate overdosage.

In cases where an alert patient has ingested excessive oral medication, induced emesis followed by gastric lavage should be performed. In an unconscious patient, ensure securing of the airway with a cuffed endotracheal tube prior to lavage, and emesis should not be induced. Instillation of activated charcoal slurry may aid in reducing absorption of terbutaline.

### Terbutaline sulfate [^112UuXuU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In vitro and in vivo pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that terbutaline exerts a preferential effect on beta2-adrenergic receptors. While it is recognized that beta2-adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, data indicate that there is a population of beta2-receptors in the human heart, existing in a concentration between 10% to 50%. The precise function of these receptors has not been established (see WARNINGS). In controlled clinical studies in patients given terbutaline sulfate orally, proportionally greater changes occurred in pulmonary function parameters than in heart rate or blood pressure. This suggests a relative preference for the beta2-receptors in humans; however, the usual cardiovascular effects commonly associated with other sympathomimetic agents were also observed with terbutaline sulfate.

The pharmacologic effects of beta-adrenergic agonists, including terbutaline, are at least in part attributable to stimulation through beta-adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic 3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased cAMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.

Controlled clinical studies have shown that terbutaline sulfate relieves bronchospasm in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by significantly increasing pulmonary function, such as an increase of 15% or more in FEV1.

### Cardiovascular effects of beta-agonists in patients with asthma and COPD: a meta-analysis [^114N5Wqd]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Beta-adrenergic agonists exert physiological effects that are the opposite of those of beta-blockers. Beta-blockers are known to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiac disease. Beta(2)-agonist use in patients with obstructive airway disease has been associated with an increased risk for myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrest, and acute cardiac death.

- **Objectives**: To assess the cardiovascular safety of beta(2)-agonist use in patients with obstructive airway disease, defined as asthma or COPD.

- **Methods**: A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials of beta(2)-agonist treatment in patients with obstructive airway disease was performed to evaluate the short-term effect on heart rate and potassium concentrations, and the long-term effect on adverse cardiovascular events. Longer duration trials were included in the analysis if they reported at least one adverse event. Adverse events included sinus and ventricular tachycardia, syncope, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, or sudden death.

- **Results**: Thirteen single-dose trials and 20 longer duration trials were included in the study. A single dose of beta(2)-agonist increased the heart rate by 9.12 beats/min (95% confidence interval, 5.32 to 12.92) and reduced the potassium concentration by 0.36 mmol/L (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.54), compared to placebo. For trials lasting from 3 days to 1 year, beta(2)-agonist treatment significantly increased the risk for a cardiovascular event (relative risk [RR], 2.54; 95% CI, 1.59 to 4).

### Terbutaline pump maintenance therapy after threatened preterm labour for reducing adverse neonatal outcomes [^1166XMNr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

After the successful inhibition of threatened preterm labour, women are at high risk of experiencing recurrent preterm labour. Terbutaline pump maintenance therapy has been used to reduce adverse neonatal outcomes. This review replaces an earlier Cochrane review, published in 2002, which is no longer being updated by the team.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness of terbutaline pump maintenance therapy after threatened preterm labour in reducing adverse neonatal outcomes.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2014) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing terbutaline pump therapy with alternative therapy, placebo, or no therapy after arrest of threatened preterm labour.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and then extracted data as eligible for inclusion in qualitative and quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis).

- **Main results**: Four studies were included with a total of 234 women randomised. The overall methodological quality of the included studies was mixed; two studies provided very little information on study methods. There was high sample attrition in one study, and in three studies, the risk of performance bias was high. We found no strong evidence that terbutaline maintenance therapy offered any advantages over saline placebo or oral terbutaline maintenance therapy in reducing adverse neonatal outcomes by prolonging pregnancy among women with arrested preterm labour.

### Terbutaline versus nifedipine for prolongation of pregnancy in patients with preterm labor [^111CPxDY]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness, safety, and potential adverse effects of terbutaline and nifedipine in prolonging pregnancy beyond 48 hours.

A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 174 pregnant women admitted with preterm labor. These participants were randomized into two groups, receiving either terbutaline (95 patients) or nifedipine (79 patients). Data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate analyses through logistic regression.

Results indicated no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of prolonging gestation to 48 hours. The failure rate for prolonging gestation for 24 hours was 12.6% in the terbutaline group and 10.1% in the nifedipine group, which was not statistically significant (P value = 0.61). Side effects were significantly more common in the terbutaline group, excluding maternal hypotension.

In conclusion, both terbutaline and nifedipine appear to be equally effective as tocolytic agents. However, nifedipine had the advantage of easier administration and significantly less impact on the fetal heart rate.

### Association of antenatal terbutaline and respiratory support requirements in preterm neonates [^115MsDa8]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Low credibility.

Before the advent of antenatal steroids, early non-invasive respiratory support (NIV), and intratracheal surfactant, antenatal terbutaline was also used to improve lung compliance and reduce the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).

- **Objectives**: The objective of this paper was to study the association between antenatal terbutaline and endotracheal intubation (ET) within the first 24 hours of life, RDS, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in infants with a gestational age (GA) of less than 32 weeks. It also aimed to study the association between antenatal terbutaline and ET or NIV within the first 24 hours of life, and RDS in infants with a GA of 32 to 36 weeks.

- **Method**: This was a retrospective medical record review of preterm infants delivered at a single tertiary care center from October 2016 to December 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the association between antenatal terbutaline and neonatal respiratory support.

- **Result**: A total of 1,794 infants were included in the study, with 234 (13.0%) having a GA of less than 32 weeks and 1,560 (86.9%) having a GA of 32 to 36 weeks. Antenatal terbutaline, corticosteroid, or both agents were administered in 561 (31.3%), 1,461 (81.4%), and 555 (30.9%) of cases, respectively. Antenatal terbutaline was significantly associated with a reduction in ET (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.19–0.82, p = 0.012) in infants with a GA of less than 32 weeks, but not in infants with a GA of 32–36 weeks. Antenatal terbutaline was not associated with RDS or BPD, but it was significantly associated with a reduction…

### Continuous subcutaneous terbutaline administration prolongs pregnancy after recurrent preterm labor [^111v9XpG]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous terbutaline (SQT) administered in the home setting for women experiencing recurrent preterm labor (RPTL) before 32 weeks' gestation.

Women with RPTL were treated with continuous SQT and compared to matched control patients who were not given tocolytic therapy after hospitalization. The study involved 15 patients receiving SQT and 45 control women (in a 3:1 ratio). The key findings were as follows:

- **Gestational age at delivery**: The study group showed a significant increase in deliveries beyond 37 weeks (53% vs. 4%) and a notable decrease in deliveries before 32 weeks (0% vs. 47%).

- **Pregnancy prolongation**: There was a significant improvement in the duration of pregnancy in the SQT group, with an average of 49.8 ± 19.2 days compared to 24.5 ± 12.8 days in the control group (P < .001).

- **Maternal and neonatal outcomes**: The study patients experienced fewer maternal hospital days (9.8 ± 2.1 vs. 15.9 ± 7.4, P < .0001), reduced duration of NICU stays (1.9 ± 4.9 vs. 19.8 ± 29.3 days, P < .001), and decreased total costs for newborn care (6,995 ± 14,822 USD vs. 62,033 ± 89,978 USD, P < .002).

For every dollar spent on SQT, there was a savings of 4.67 USD in newborn hospital costs for the control patients. In conclusion, this small study demonstrates that the use of SQT significantly prolongs pregnancy, reduces serious neonatal complications, and decreases the duration of hospitalization and neonatal costs.

### Salbutamol for transient tachypnea of the newborn [^117QJ1Qu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Transient tachypnea of the newborn is characterized by tachypnea and signs of respiratory distress. This condition typically appears within the first two hours of life in term and late preterm newborns. Although it is usually a self-limited condition, transient tachypnea of the newborn is associated with wheezing syndromes in late childhood. The rationale for the use of salbutamol (albuterol) is based on studies showing that β-agonists can accelerate the rate of alveolar fluid clearance. This review was originally published in 2016 and updated in 2020.

- **Objectives**: To assess whether salbutamol, compared to placebo, no treatment, or any other drugs administered, is effective and safe for infants born at 34 weeks' gestational age with this diagnosis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2020, Issue 4) in the Cochrane Library; PubMed (1996 to April 2020), Embase (1980 to April 2020); and CINAHL (1982 to April 2020). We applied no language restrictions. We searched the abstracts of the major congresses in the field (Perinatal Society of Australia New Zealand and Pediatric Academic Societies) from 2000 to 2020 and clinical trial registries.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized controlled trials, and cluster trials comparing salbutamol versus placebo, no treatment, or any other drugs administered to infants born at 34 weeks' gestational age or more and less than three days of age with transient tachypnea.

### A comparison of gestational days gained with oral terbutaline versus continuous subcutaneous terbutaline in women with twin gestations [^1178VZ2H]. Journal of Perinatology (2000). Low credibility.

To compare gestational days gained with oral versus subcutaneous terbutaline for maintenance tocolysis, 386 women enrolled in an outpatient preterm labor identification program were studied retrospectively. The participants met the following criteria: twin gestation, development of threatened preterm labor resulting in treatment with oral terbutaline, and subsequent recurrence of threatened preterm labor resulting in treatment with continuous subcutaneous terbutaline. The primary outcome measured was the number of gestational days gained with oral terbutaline versus continuous subcutaneous terbutaline.

- **Results**: There were significantly more days gained during subcutaneous treatment than during oral treatment (34.0 ± 19.8 versus 19.3 ± 15.3 days). Thirty-three percent of desired prolongation was achieved with oral terbutaline, whereas 79% of desired prolongation was achieved with subcutaneous terbutaline (p < 0.001). Patients gained a mean of 53.4 ± 21.4 days overall with outpatient tocolysis. The mean gestational age at delivery was 35.2 ± 1.9 weeks.

- **Conclusion**: Continuous subcutaneous terbutaline was superior to oral terbutaline in prolonging gestation in women with twin gestations.

### Terbutaline sulfate [^115YYVpX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Adverse reactions observed with terbutaline sulfate are similar to those commonly seen with other sympathomimetic amines. These reactions are generally transient in nature and usually do not require treatment. The frequency of these side effects appears to diminish with continued therapy.

The following table lists the adverse reactions seen in 199 patients treated with terbutaline sulfate tablets during six double-blind crossover studies and four double-blind parallel studies (short- and long-term) performed in the United States.

- **Percent incidence of adverse reactions** (total daily dosage range 5 mg to 15 mg):
	- Terbutaline N = 199.

The following adverse effects each occurred in fewer than 1% of patients: hallucinations, rash, paresthesia, hypertonia (muscle cramps), and vomiting. There have been rare reports of elevation in liver enzymes and of hypersensitivity vasculitis.

### Terbutaline in myasthenia gravis: a pilot study [^113sUgco]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the short-term efficacy and safety of terbutaline, a beta2-adrenergic agonist, in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. The primary endpoint for efficacy was a reduction of at least 3 points in the quantitative MG score (QMGS). Secondary endpoints included changes in the functional disability scale (FDS), forced vital capacity (FVC), grip strength, anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody levels, and decremental response.

During the terbutaline phase, five out of eight (63%) patients showed an improvement in the QMGS of 3.0 or greater, while 3 out of 8 (38%) patients demonstrated improvement in the FDS by one grade. No improvement was seen during the placebo period. Statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirmed that terbutaline treatment resulted in significant improvement in QMGS. There was no change in FVC, grip strength, or anti-AChR antibody levels, but there was an improvement in the decremental response during the terbutaline phase.

Terbutaline was well-tolerated in all study subjects. We conclude that terbutaline may be an effective adjunct therapy in a subset of patients with myasthenia, although confirmation with larger trials will be required.

### Terbutaline and the prevention of nocturnal hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes [^111gFdbW]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Iatrogenic hypoglycemia is the limiting factor in the glycemic management of diabetes. Most episodes of hypoglycemia occur at night, specifically during sleep, in type 1 diabetes — a finding in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial that continues to be documented. Sympathoadrenal responses to hypoglycemia are reduced further during sleep, and patients with type 1 diabetes are substantially less likely to be awakened by hypoglycemia than non-diabetic individuals due to their markedly reduced sympathoadrenal responses.

Among the approaches to the prevention of nocturnal hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes, we found bedtime administration of a conventional snack, uncooked cornstarch, or an α-glucosidase inhibitor to be ineffective. In contrast, bedtime administration of the epinephrine-simulating β2-adrenergic agonist terbutaline in a dose of 5.0 mg prevented nocturnal hypoglycemia. However, it also caused hyperglycemia the following morning. Therefore, we used a randomized double-blind crossover design (placebo, 2.5 mg terbutaline, and 5.0 mg terbutaline) in a pilot study to test the hypothesis that bedtime administration of 2.5 mg terbutaline prevents nocturnal hypoglycemia without causing morning hypoglycemia in patients with aggressively treated type 1 diabetes.

### Nebulized terbutaline and ipratropium bromide versus terbutaline alone in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring noninvasive ventilation: A randomized double-blind controlled trial [^115fgPeu]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Short-acting β2-agonists are the mainstay of treatment for patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) in the emergency department (ED). It is still unclear whether the addition of short-acting anticholinergics is clinically more effective compared to treatment with β2-agonists alone in patients with hypercapnic AECOPD.

- **Objective**: The objective was to evaluate whether combining ipratropium bromide (IB) with terbutaline reduces hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates compared to terbutaline alone in AECOPD hypercapnic patients.

- **Methods**: In this double-blind controlled trial, patients who were admitted to the ED for AECOPD requiring noninvasive ventilation (NIV) were randomized to receive either 5 mg of nebulized terbutaline combined with 0.5 mg of IB (terbutaline/IB group, n = 115) or 5 mg of terbutaline sulfate (terbutaline group, n = 117). Nebulization was repeated every 20 minutes for the first hour and every 4 hours within the first day. Primary outcomes were the rate of hospital admission and need for endotracheal intubation within the first 24 hours of the start of the experimental treatment. Secondary outcomes included changes from baseline in dyspnea, physiologic variables, length of hospital stay, ICU admission rate, and 7-day mortality.

- **Results**: The two groups were similar regarding baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. Hospital admission was observed in 70 patients (59.8%) in the terbutaline/IB group and in 75 patients (65.2%) in the terbutaline group.

### Is there a problem with inhaled long-acting beta-adrenergic agonists [^114YCAVy]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Short-acting beta(2)-agonists are effective in relieving acute symptoms of asthma and in the short-term prevention of symptoms from stimuli, such as exercise. They are ineffective when used on a regular schedule to improve asthma control. Long-acting beta(2)-agonists, on the other hand, provide sustained bronchodilation and improve asthma control. Regular use of long-acting beta(2)-agonists is not associated with significant tolerance to their bronchodilator action, impairment in the response to albuterol, decreased baseline pulmonary function, increased response to methacholine, or increased risk of adverse cardiac events.

Case-control studies do not suggest an increased risk for death or intensive care unit admissions with the use of long-acting beta(2)-agonists. In prospective studies in which there has been an increase in asthma deaths or serious asthma exacerbations, this increased risk has not been observed in subjects using inhaled corticosteroids. Where increased deaths have occurred in relation to either short- or long-acting beta(2)-agonists, the events have not occurred equally throughout the exposed population. This suggests that these outcomes were not a direct toxic effect of the drugs and increases the possibility that they resulted from an interaction between relief of symptoms by beta(2)-agonists and delay in seeking medical care.

### Overview. Preterm labour: mechanisms and management [^117JD1UP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2007). Low credibility.

The management of preterm labour involves the use of various pharmacological interventions. The most commonly used drugs for the treatment of threatened preterm labour have been the betamimetics. Ritodrine and terbutaline were introduced as selective β2-adrenoceptor (ADRB2) agonists, and in 1980, the FDA approved ritodrine hydrochloride for use in preterm labour. ADRB2 receptors are positively coupled to Gαs/ADCY, and their effects are mediated by the cAMP pathway. Although the exact mechanism of action is not known, it is likely to involve activation of PRKA and phosphorylation of proteins involved in smooth muscle relaxation.

Betamimetics are effective at delaying delivery in women experiencing preterm labour for 48 hours, but there is no evidence that this short delay provides any benefit in terms of perinatal mortality or morbidity. Stimulation of ADRB2 receptors results in desensitization and downregulation. Short-term tocolysis with intravenous ritodrine may be helpful to transfer women in preterm labour to a hospital with better neonatal facilities or to allow time to complete a course of antenatal glucocorticoids, although even these advantages are controversial. Long-term tocolysis with oral terbutaline for maintenance therapy after threatened preterm labour shows no benefit compared to placebo.

Use of ADRB2 agonists is associated with unpleasant and potentially serious cardiovascular, metabolic, and neuromuscular side effects. This represents a major drawback to their clinical use. As reported in this issue, new data show that the predominant β-adrenoceptor in late pregnant human myometrium is the β3-adrenoceptor (ADRB3).

### Formoterol in clinical practice — safety issues [^1144stZ4]. Respiratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

While short-acting beta2-agonists are regarded as the cornerstone of treatment for asthma as relief medication, guidelines recommend long-acting beta2-agonists as maintenance therapy in combination with inhaled corticosteroids for patients with moderate to severe asthma who are poorly controlled on current treatment. Although evidence indicates that formoterol, with its fast and long-acting profile, is effective when used both as regular and as-needed therapy in all types of asthma, concerns have been raised about the potential for long-acting beta2-agonists to produce side effects with a longer duration than those seen with short-acting beta2-agonists.

Additionally, when formoterol is used as needed, a higher total daily dose might be anticipated than when taken twice daily for regular maintenance therapy, which has also raised concerns. In a number of studies, formoterol has been shown to be well tolerated, and although systemic effects expected with this class of drugs did occur, formoterol had significantly less impact on serum potassium, pulse, blood pressure, cardiac frequency, and the QT interval compared with terbutaline. Moreover, the duration of effects was equivalent to that observed with terbutaline and salbutamol, and the relative therapeutic index of formoterol compared with salbutamol was found to be 2.5. Furthermore, studies examining the long-term use of formoterol have shown no reduction in bronchodilatory effect and thus, no development of tolerance.

In conclusion, formoterol is well tolerated in high doses, producing side effects typical of its class.

### Rebound hyperkalemia after cessation of intravenous tocolytic therapy with terbutaline in the treatment of preterm labor: Anesthetic implications [^114r6EA4]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2003). Low credibility.

Beta-adrenergic agents have been widely used in obstetrics to attenuate premature labor, delay delivery, allow fetal maturation, and thereby reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality. Hypokalemia is a common side effect during beta-adrenergic tocolytic therapy for the treatment of preterm labor. Although rebound hyperkalemia after cessation of tocolytic therapy with ritodrine has been reported, there have been no reports of hyperkalemia occurring after the cessation of beta-adrenergic tocolytic therapy with terbutaline for preterm labor; we report such a case.

### Inhaled β-agonist does not modify sympathetic activity in patients with COPD [^111kQW2C]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hemodynamics, baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate variability, ventilation, and pulse wave velocity were assessed. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), showed no relevant changes. Heart rate increased significantly after acute salmeterol inhalation at both visit 1 and visit 2 compared to baseline. The resting heart rate after 4 weeks of salmeterol treatment rose from 65.6 ± 9.4 bpm at baseline to 67.1 ± 9.9 bpm at visit 2, before the administration of salmeterol (p = 0.04 in a paired t-test). As an acute effect of salmeterol, the low-frequency power (LF) of heart rate variability (HRV), reflecting sympathetic tone, was significantly elevated, while high-frequency power (HF), reflecting parasympathetic tone, decreased. There was no correlation between changes in heart rate, HRV, BRS, and changes in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA).

- **Table 2: Heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity**. Baseline = value at visit 1 before any inhalation; HF = High frequency component; LF = Low frequency component; SDNN = Standard deviation of the NN interval; RMSSD = Root mean square of the successive differences.

The course of lung function and respiratory parameters is shown in Table 3. Mean tidal volume and mean respiratory minute volume increased after salmeterol inhalation at visit 1. This effect was not observed after 4 weeks of salmeterol treatment. Total lung capacity (TLC), residual volume (RV), and functional residual capacity (FRC) significantly decreased after acute and long-term salmeterol inhalation, while forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) remained unchanged. Capillary blood gas analysis, continuous measurements of oxygen saturation, and transcutaneous pCO2 revealed no relevant changes.

### Salbutamol-induced electrophysiological changes show no correlation with electrophysiological changes during hyperinsulinaemic-hypoglycaemic clamp in young people with type 1 diabetes [^1171Ttus]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The study examines the relationship between salbutamol-induced electrophysiological changes and those occurring during hypoglycaemic conditions in individuals with type 1 diabetes. Hypoglycaemia is known to cause QT-interval prolongation, which is pro-arrhythmogenic, while salbutamol, a β2-adrenoreceptor agonist, also prolongs the QT-interval. It was hypothesized that the magnitude of electrophysiological changes induced by salbutamol and hypoglycaemia could be related, suggesting salbutamol as a potential non-invasive screening tool for predicting an individual's electrophysiological response to hypoglycaemia.

Eighteen individuals with type 1 diabetes were studied, where each received 2.5 mg of nebulized salbutamol. The participants then underwent a hyperinsulinaemic-hypoglycaemic clamp set at 2.5 mmol/l for 1 hour. During both procedures, heart rate and serum potassium levels (and catecholamines during the clamp) were monitored. A high-resolution ECG was recorded at pre-set intervals to measure cardiac repolarization. This included QT-interval duration adjusted for heart rate (QTc), T-wave amplitude (Tamp), T-peak to T-end interval duration (TpTend), and T-wave area symmetry (Tsym). The maximum changes from baseline in both experiments were evaluated for linear dependence.

- **Results**: Salbutamol led to prolongation of QTc and TpTend, and a reduction in Tamp and Tsym. Similarly, hypoglycaemia resulted in increased plasma catecholamines, hypokalaemia, and prolongation of QTc and TpTend, alongside reduced Tamp and Tsym. However, no significant correlation was observed between the maximum electrophysiological changes in QTc (r = 0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.341 to 0.576; P = 0.553), TpTend (r = 0.075, 95% CI -0.406 to 0.524; P = 0.767), and Tsym (r = 0.355, 95% CI).

### Salbutamol for transient tachypnea of the newborn [^1121JaDe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Transient tachypnea of the newborn is characterized by tachypnea and signs of respiratory distress and typically appears within the first two hours of life in term and late preterm newborns. Although it is usually a self-limited condition, transient tachypnea of the newborn is associated with wheezing syndromes in late childhood. The rationale for using salbutamol (albuterol) for this condition is based on studies showing that β-agonists can accelerate the rate of alveolar fluid clearance.

- **Objectives**: To assess whether salbutamol, compared to placebo, no treatment, or any other drugs administered, is effective and safe in treating transient tachypnea of the newborn in infants born at 34 weeks' gestational age or more.

### Inhaled β-agonist does not modify sympathetic activity in patients with COPD [^117HRyuZ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: This was a partially blinded, single-arm, single-centre study involving subjects with COPD GOLD stage II or III. The study included a screening visit, two study visits (visit 1 at week 0 and visit 2 at week 4), and a telephone contact at week 2. At the screening visit, the eligibility of subjects was assessed, and written informed consent was obtained.

- **Study design**: At visit 1, a complex measurement period with continuous recordings of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), blood pressure, tidal volume, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and transcutaneous CO2 was conducted while placebo and 50 μg salmeterol were inhaled by the subjects sequentially. Following visit 1, all subjects were treated with salmeterol 50 μg twice daily for 4 weeks. At visit 2, these observations were repeated without placebo inhalation. Subjects were recruited at a single study centre with the assistance of two local chest physicians and newspaper advertisements.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Male or female patients aged between 40 and 80 years were eligible to enter the study. Inclusion criteria required COPD GOLD class II or III with a post-bronchodilator spirometry forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) < 70% predicted or a prior history of ≥ 10 pack-years of cigarette smoking. The main exclusion criteria included concomitant active lung diseases other than COPD, exacerbation or hospitalization due to COPD six weeks prior to screening, frequent exacerbations necessitating therapy with inhaled glucocorticosteroids, non-invasive ventilation, treatment with drugs affecting sympathetic tone (e.g. theophylline), and the use of systemic glucocorticoids.

### The occurrence of adverse events in women receiving continuous subcutaneous terbutaline therapy [^114KD3RT]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of serious adverse events in patients receiving continuous subcutaneous terbutaline after arrested preterm labor. Women with singleton, twin, and triplet pregnancies prescribed continuous subcutaneous terbutaline were studied. Electronic patient records were reviewed for patient tolerance of medication and serious adverse events. The primary study outcome was the frequency of serious adverse events.

Available for analysis were 9,359 patient records. Transient medication side effects were reported by 1,447 (15.5%) patients. Severe adverse events were identified in 12 patients either during treatment with continuous subcutaneous terbutaline (n = 4) or after discontinuation of outpatient treatment (n = 8). The most frequent serious adverse event was pulmonary edema (n = 9). There was no maternal mortality.

Continuous subcutaneous terbutaline infusion was associated with an extremely low incidence of serious adverse events. Patients with comorbidities and/or concomitant tocolysis with intravenous magnesium sulfate should be closely assessed for the development of serious adverse events.

### Atrial and ventricular rate response and patterns of heart rate acceleration during maternal-fetal terbutaline treatment of fetal complete heart block [^113gdka9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Terbutaline is used to treat fetal bradycardia in the setting of complete heart block (CHB); however, little is known of its effects on atrial and ventricular beat rates or patterns of heart rate (HR) acceleration. Fetal atrial and ventricular beat rates were compared before and after transplacental terbutaline treatment (10 to 30 mg/day) by fetal echocardiography in 17 fetuses with CHB caused by immune-mediated damage to a normal conduction system (isoimmune, n = 8) or a congenitally malformed conduction system associated with left atrial isomerism (LAI, n = 9).

While receiving terbutaline, 9 of the 17 fetuses underwent fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) to assess maternal HR and rhythm, patterns of fetal HR acceleration, and correlation between fetal atrial and ventricular accelerations (i.e. AV correlation). Maternal HR and fetal atrial and ventricular beat rates increased with terbutaline. However, terbutaline's effects were greater on the atrial pacemaker(s) in fetuses with isoimmune CHB and greater on the ventricular pacemaker(s) in those with LAI-associated CHB. Patterns of fetal HR acceleration also differed between isoimmune and LAI CHB. Finally, despite increasing HR, terbutaline did not restore the normal coordinated response between atrial and ventricular accelerations in isoimmune or LAI CHB.

In conclusion, the pathophysiologic heterogeneity of CHB is reflected in the differing effect of terbutaline on the atrial and ventricular pacemaker(s) and varying patterns of HR acceleration. However, regardless of the cause of CHB, terbutaline augments HR but not AV correlation.

### Terbutaline and the prevention of nocturnal hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes [^1132Nt6j]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Results

Bedtime administration of 5.0 mg terbutaline, but not 2.5 mg, raised mean plasma glucose concentrations during the night (ANOVA P < 0.01) (data not shown). Nadir nocturnal plasma glucose concentrations were < 70 mg/dl in seven patients (47%), < 60 mg/dl in six (40%), < 50 mg/dl in five (33%), and < 40 mg/dl in two (13%) following bedtime placebo. Corresponding nadir nocturnal concentrations were observed in seven, six, two, and zero patients, respectively, following administration of 2.5 mg terbutaline and in three, zero (P < 0.02 vs. placebo), zero (P < 0.05 vs. placebo), and zero patients following administration of 5.0 mg terbutaline.

Mean nadir plasma glucose concentrations were 87 ± 14 mg/dl following placebo, 100 ± 14 mg/dl following 2.5 mg terbutaline, and 122 ± 13 mg/dl following 5.0 mg terbutaline (P < 0.05 vs. placebo). Mean 0700 h glucose levels were 113 ± 18, 127 ± 17, and 183 ± 19 mg/dl (P < 0.02 vs. placebo), respectively. Mean 0700 h heart rates were 78 ± 5, 82 ± 4, and 88 ± 5 bpm (P < 0.02 vs. placebo). Terbutaline was seemingly well tolerated.

Circulation (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, more specifically concerning ongoing management, the ACC/AHA/HRS 2016 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of the following medications for patients without structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease who have symptomatic SVT and are not candidates for, or prefer not to undergo, catheter ablation:

- **Flecainide**: An anti-arrhythmic medication used to prevent and treat atrial tachyarrhythmias.

- **Propafenone**: Another anti-arrhythmic agent effective for the management of SVT in similar patient populations.

### SPL drug information for terbutaline sulfate [^117PFzWL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of terbutaline sulfate SC in pregnant patients for all trimesters, it is advised to avoid its use. Evidence suggests fetal harm in humans. Serious adverse reactions such as increased heart rate, transient hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, myocardial ischemia, and death have been reported in pregnant women after taking this drug. Increased fetal heart rate and neonatal hypoglycemia may occur as a result of maternal administration.

- **Maintenance therapy for asthma and other pulmonary diseases**: Use with caution at the end of pregnancy because of the potential tocolytic effect.
- **Labor and delivery**: The use for relief of bronchospasm during labor should be restricted to patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risk.

The drug terbutaline sulfate SC is classified under category A in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by a large number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without any proven increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus having been observed.

### Propranolol hydrochloride [^116MQuxa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Propranolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent possessing no other autonomic nervous system activity. It specifically competes with beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating agents for available receptor sites. When access to beta-receptor sites is blocked by propranolol, chronotropic, inotropic, and vasodilator responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation are decreased proportionately. At doses greater than required for beta blockade, propranolol also exerts a quinidine-like or anesthetic-like membrane action, which affects the cardiac action potential. The significance of the membrane action in the treatment of arrhythmias is uncertain.

- **Mechanism of action**: The effects of propranolol are due to selective blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors, leaving alpha-adrenergic responses intact. There are two well-characterized subtypes of beta receptors (beta1 and beta2); propranolol interacts with both subtypes equally. Beta1-adrenergic receptors are found primarily in the heart. Blockade of cardiac beta1-adrenergic receptors leads to a decrease in the activity of both normal and ectopic pacemaker cells and a decrease in A-V nodal conduction velocity. All of these actions can contribute to antiarrhythmic activity and control of ventricular rate during arrhythmias. Blockade of cardiac beta1-adrenergic receptors also decreases the myocardial force of contraction and may provoke cardiac decompensation in patients with minimal cardiac reserve.

Beta2-adrenergic receptors are found predominantly in smooth muscle — vascular, bronchial, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary.

### Ivabradine use in critical care: A systematic review and metanalysis of cardiogenic and septic shock patients [^112jZZSm]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Low credibility.

Tachycardia is a common trait of acute circulatory failure; while it initially serves to maintain adequate cardiac output, oxygen delivery, and tissue oxygenation, tachycardia may persist over time despite appropriate fluid and vasopressor resuscitation or may result from inotropic therapy. In patients with septic shock, persistent tachycardia was associated with a higher probability of death, yet beta-blockers showed no effect on outcome, with concerns of possible harm due to their negative effect on myocardial contractility. In patients with low cardiac output during cardiogenic shock or after cardiac surgery, dobutamine is administered to improve contractility and cardiac output; yet, it can induce persistent tachycardia, with negative effects on myocardial metabolism, cardiac efficiency, and is associated with a higher risk of arrhythmias.

Ivabradine is an approved drug for chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, serving as an adjunct to beta-blockers for rate control. It is available in pills to be administered twice daily for a 2-hour main half-life and 11-hour effective half-life. This drug targets the sinoatrial node "funny" currents (If) channels, responsible for its pacemaker activity. By interacting only with the active state of the channel, ivabradine can reduce heart rate without causing severe bradycardia. Unlike beta-blockers and calcium channel antagonists, ivabradine does not exhibit negative inotropic effects, making its use appealing in patients with impaired contractility, acute circulatory failure, and multi-organ dysfunction.

### Takotsubo cardiomyopathy with use of salbutamol nebulisation and aminophylline infusion in a patient with acute asthma exacerbation [^112NkpYz]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as apical ballooning syndrome or stress-induced cardiomyopathy, is characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction. It mimics myocardial infarction in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease or acute plaque rupture during coronary angiography. The exact mechanism of myocardial dysfunction in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy remains unknown; however, due to its association with physical and emotional stress, it is postulated that catecholamines play a central role in its pathogenesis. We present a case of a patient who was admitted with acute asthma exacerbation and treated with β-2 agonist nebulisation and intravenous aminophylline. During her hospital stay, she developed Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

### Inhaled β-agonist does not modify sympathetic activity in patients with COPD [^115mpibR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Neurohumoral activation is present in COPD and might provide a link between pulmonary and systemic effects, especially cardiovascular disease. Because long-acting inhaled β-agonists reduce hyperinflation, they could reduce sympathoexcitation by improving the inflation reflex. We aimed to evaluate if inhaled therapy with salmeterol reduces muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) evaluated by microneurography.

- **Methods**: MSNA, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration were continually measured. After a baseline recording of 20 minutes, placebo was administered; following a further 45 minutes, salmeterol (50 μg) was administered, which was followed by a further 45 minutes of data recording. Additionally, lung function, plasma catecholamine levels, arterial pulse wave velocity, heart rate variability, and baroreflex sensitivity were evaluated. Following 4 weeks of treatment with salmeterol 50 μg twice daily, measurements were repeated without placebo administration.

- **Results**: A total of 32 COPD patients were included. Valid MSNA signals were obtained from 18 patients. Change in MSNA (bursts/100 heartbeats) following acute administration of salmeterol did not differ significantly from the change following placebo (-1.96 ± 9.81 vs. -0.65 ± 9.07; p = 0.51) although hyperinflation was significantly reduced. Likewise, no changes in MSNA or catecholamines were observed after 4 weeks. Heart rate increased significantly by 3.8 ± 4.2 (p < 0.01) acutely and 3.9 ± 4.3 bpm (p < 0.01) after 4 weeks. Salmeterol treatment was safe and well tolerated.

- **Conclusions**: By using microneurography, we can confirm…

### Terbutaline: Level the playing field for inhaled β-agonists by introducing a dosing and urine threshold [^116gPmen]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Terbutaline, a short-acting β2-agonist similar to salbutamol, is widely used in Europe for the treatment of asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Unlike salbutamol, terbutaline requires therapeutic use exemption (TUE) for therapeutic inhaled use in competitive sport. There is now compelling evidence that supratherapeutic use of terbutaline is performance-enhancing, via oral dosing and inhalation. It is likely that the ergogenic effects of terbutaline are class-specific for all β2-agonists. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has introduced dosing and urine thresholds and decision limits for other common β2-agonists, allowing athletes to use these drugs for therapeutic purposes while minimizing the potential for doping and the administrative burden of TUEs. However, no such threshold limits currently exist for terbutaline. For terbutaline, athletes can be granted a TUE and then administer the drug via inhalation at supratherapeutic doses with impunity. The introduction of threshold dosing and urine limits for terbutaline should be a high priority, given the drug's demonstrated ergogenic effects.

### Comparison of the acute effects of salbutamol and terbutaline on heart rate variability in adult asthmatic patients [^116qRjdZ]. The European Respiratory Journal (2001). Low credibility.

This study investigated the effects of beta2-adrenergic agonist therapy on heart rate variability (HRV) in adult asthmatic patients using frequency domain measures of HRV. A randomized crossover design was employed, involving twenty adult patients with asthma. All participants exhibited a mild-to-moderate decrease in baseline forced expiratory volume in one second. Any diseases that might have influenced autonomic function were excluded. Each patient underwent a comprehensive physical examination and medical history review, which revealed no cardiovascular diseases or medications.

The study administered 200 micrograms of inhaled salbutamol and 500 micrograms of inhaled terbutaline. HRV analysis was conducted for each 5-minute segment, beginning 5 minutes before inhalation of the study drug and continuing at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes after inhalation. Key metrics calculated included total power (TP: < 0.40 Hz), high-frequency power (HF: 0.15–0.40 Hz), low-frequency power (LF: 0.04–0.15 Hz), and the LF/HF ratio.

- **Study results**: The LF and LF/HF ratio increased, while TP decreased at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes post-inhalation of both salbutamol and terbutaline. HF did not change significantly after inhalation of either drug. The study concluded that acute inhalation of salbutamol and terbutaline produces similar effects on heart rate variability and increases sympathetic modulation in cardiac autonomic activity.

### Terbutaline and the prevention of nocturnal hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes [^113Kgex3]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether bedtime administration of 2.5 mg of the β2-adrenergic agonist terbutaline could prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia without causing morning hyperglycemia in individuals with type 1 diabetes. Previous studies suggested that a 5.0 mg dosage effectively prevented nocturnal hypoglycemia but resulted in morning hyperglycemia.

- **Research design and methods**: This investigation was a randomized, double-blind crossover pilot study involving 15 patients with type 1 diabetes. The study compared placebo, 2.5 mg terbutaline, and 5.0 mg terbutaline administrations.

- **Results**: The study revealed mean ± SE nadir nocturnal plasma glucose concentrations of 87 ± 14 mg/dl following placebo, 100 ± 14 mg/dl following 2.5 mg terbutaline, and 122 ± 13 mg/dl following 5.0 mg terbutaline (P < 0.05 vs. placebo). Nadir levels were < 50 mg/dl in 5, 2, and 0 patients, respectively (P < 0.05 vs. placebo). Morning glucose levels were 113 ± 18, 127 ± 17, and 183 ± 19 mg/dl for placebo, 2.5 mg, and 5.0 mg groups, respectively (P < 0.02 vs. placebo).

- **Conclusions**: Terbutaline has the potential to be effective and safe for preventing nocturnal hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes. This requires confirmation in a suitably powered randomized controlled trial.

### Salbutamol-induced electrophysiological changes show no correlation with electrophysiological changes during hyperinsulinaemic-hypoglycaemic clamp in young people with type 1 diabetes [^113FeTpk]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Considerable evidence indicates that hypoglycaemia is pro-arrhythmogenic during both experimental and clinical conditions. Hypoglycaemia causes QTc prolongation together with pro-arrhythmogenic changes in rate-independent T-wave characteristics (TpTend, Tsym) via catecholamine release, hypokalaemia, and inhibition of rapid delayed rectifier potassium channels (IKr). Cases of bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or ventricular ectopic beats linked with hypoglycaemia have been reported previously. Although hypoglycaemia continues to be very common in people with type 1 diabetes, sudden nocturnal deaths ('dead-in-bed' syndrome), in which hypoglycaemia-induced malignant arrhythmias have been implicated, are fortunately very rare. This indicates that the risk of arrhythmias is confined to only a few individuals. However, whether increased susceptibility is related to genetic factors, autonomic dysfunction, or other unrecognized influences remains unclear. If those at greatest risk of QTc lengthening and potentially hypoglycaemia-induced arrhythmias could be identified with a simple screening test, it might then be possible to use therapeutic or technological interventions to prevent the development of malignant cardiac arrhythmias.

Salbutamol is a β-adrenoreceptor agonist with predominant β2 activity commonly used for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Salbutamol's positive chronotropic effect has been classically linked with β1-adrenoreceptor stimulation, whereas QTc prolongation has been associated with its β2 activity.

### Effect of beta-blocking therapy on outcome in the Multicenter UnSustained Tachycardia Trial (MUSTT) [^113XLx7o]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers are known to reduce total mortality and sudden death in survivors of recent myocardial infarction. However, the effects of these agents in patients at high risk for sudden death with remote infarction are not clear.

- **Methods and results**: We analyzed the effect of beta-blockers on outcomes in 2,096 patients with coronary artery disease, ejection fraction ≤ 40%, and spontaneous nonsustained ventricular tachycardia enrolled in the Multicenter UnSustained Tachycardia Trial (MUSTT). Forty-five percent of 702 patients with inducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia and 35% of 1,394 patients without inducible tachycardia were discharged from the hospital receiving beta-blockers. Patients treated with beta-blockers were younger, had higher ejection fractions, higher rates of recent angina, and more recent infarction. Beta-blockers were associated with decreased total mortality for the entire study population (5-year mortality 50% with beta-blockers versus 66% without beta-blockers; adjusted P = 0.0001). The mortality benefit associated with beta-blockers was present in patients with and without inducible tachycardia, except those treated with implantable defibrillators. There was no significant effect of beta-blocker therapy on the rate of arrhythmic death or cardiac arrest (adjusted P = 0.2344).

- **Conclusions**: Beta-blocking agents have beneficial effects on the survival of patients with characteristics similar to those enrolled in the MUSTT trial. These effects do not appear to be due to a specific antiarrhythmic effect of beta-blockers.

### Salbutamol-induced electrophysiological changes show no correlation with electrophysiological changes during hyperinsulinaemic-hypoglycaemic clamp in young people with type 1 diabetes [^113CUk2M]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

- **Abstract**: Hypoglycaemia causes interval prolongation and appears pro-arrhythmogenic. Salbutamol, a β2-adrenoreceptor agonist, also causes interval prolongation. We hypothesized that the magnitude of electrophysiological changes induced by salbutamol and hypoglycaemia might relate to each other and that salbutamol could be used as a non-invasive screening tool for predicting an individual's electrophysiological response to hypoglycaemia.

- **Methods**: Eighteen individuals with type 1 diabetes were administered 2.5 mg of nebulized salbutamol. Participants then underwent a hyperinsulinaemic–hypoglycaemic clamp (2.5 mmol/l for 1 h). During both experiments, heart rate and serum potassium (and catecholamines during the clamp) were measured, and a high-resolution electrocardiogram was recorded at pre-set time points. Cardiac repolarization was measured by interval duration adjusted for heart rate (c), T-wave amplitude (T amp), T-peak to T-end interval duration (T p T end), and T-wave area symmetry (T sym). The maximum changes versus baseline in both experiments were assessed for their linear dependence.

- **Results**: Salbutamol administration caused c and T p T end prolongation and a decrease in T amp and T sym. Hypoglycaemia caused increased plasma catecholamines, hypokalaemia, c and T p T end prolongation, and a decrease in T amp and T sym. No significant correlations were found between maximum changes in c [r = 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.341 to 0.576; P = 0.553], T p T end (r = 0.075, 95% CI −0.406 to 0.524; P = 0.767), or T sym (r = 0.355, 95% CI −0.132 to 0.706; P = 0.149).

### Rapiblyk [^115Jj3uZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Rapiblyk has known interactions with various other drugs.

- **Negative inotropes and chronotropes**: Avoid the concomitant use of Rapiblyk with negative inotropes and medications that slow heart rate or cardiac conduction. Beta-blockers, like Rapiblyk, may cause depression of myocardial contractility and increase the risk of bradycardia or heart block. Using Rapiblyk with negative inotropes or chronotropes may augment these effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)(5.3)].

- **Sympathomimetics, positive inotropes, and vasoconstrictors**: Beta adrenergic agonists will antagonize the effects of Rapiblyk and may reduce its heart rate-lowering effects. Positive inotropes and vasoconstrictors may also attenuate the heart rate and blood pressure-lowering effects of Rapiblyk.

- **Catecholamine depleting drugs**: Monitor patients treated with Rapiblyk plus a catecholamine depletor (e.g. reserpine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors) for hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may cause vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. Catecholamine depleting drugs may have an additive effect with beta-blockers, increasing the risk of hypotension or marked bradycardia-related vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
