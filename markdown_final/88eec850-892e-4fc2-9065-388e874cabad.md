## Question

Describe the pathophysiology, causes, clinical presentation in infants, diagnostic workup, and treatment of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the pathophysiology, causes, clinical presentation in infants, diagnostic workup, and treatment of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about framing the disease burden and epidemiology to anchor clinical relevance. Then, I should analyze the mechanistic pathophysiology, especially TLR4 signaling and dysbiosis. Next, I will consider risk factors and a multi-hit model. After that, I should review clinical presentation, including fulminant NEC and term variants. Then, I will examine diagnostic staging, labs, and imaging, including the role of ultrasound. Finally, I will outline evidence-based medical and surgical management, discuss outcomes and long-term follow-up, and note prevention and research gaps, ensuring each section is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical burden and scope so we do not understate risk. NEC predominantly affects preterm, very low birth weight infants and carries high mortality, approximately 20–25% overall and higher among ELBW or surgical cases, with diagnosis often between days 6–30 of life and a strong association with post-feed onset, which aligns with contemporary cohort reviews and trial adjudications, although definitions vary and inter-observer variability in imaging is recognized [^11527fDc] [^112vkvEr] [^1139BUb6] [^114rsRVS].

> I need to ensure the mechanistic core is precisely articulated. The most consistent, high-credibility signal implicates exaggerated Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in the premature intestine, where TLR4 expression is higher than in term infants and links to Notch-regulated developmental pathways; this primes a hyperinflammatory response to microbial ligands, with downstream NF-κB activation, cytokine release, barrier breakdown, endothelial injury, and impaired perfusion that together drive necrosis; importantly, there is converging evidence that susceptibility begins antenatally, consistent with placental inflammation or vascular insufficiency as priming events [^1153MLSw] [^113vN64e] [^116XCaYf] [^11131U17].

> Hold on, I should verify how dysbiosis integrates with this immune immaturity model. Premature infants demonstrate reduced commensal diversity with relative Proteobacteria overrepresentation, and formula feeding modifies colonization patterns and increases NEC risk, fitting a model of dysregulated host–microbiome crosstalk in an immature gut with reduced IgA, defensins, and antioxidant capacity; taken together, dysbiosis plus an overreactive TLR4 axis plus microvascular instability create the multi-hit context for NEC, which is strengthened by translational and clinical microbiome data [^116qWisr] [^114uF61r] [^115Wp3tj] [^111HpLmd].

> Next, I should review risk factors within a multi-hit framework and be cautious not to imply causality where evidence is prognostic. Non-modifiable risks include prematurity and low gestational age with an inverse incidence relationship, while modifiable or acquired factors include formula feeding, rapid feed advancement, hemodynamic instability, and antecedent sepsis; one prospective study reported an inverse association between immediate postpartum antibiotics and NEC, but wait, let me verify credibility and consistency — this finding is low-credibility and conflicts with concerns about microbiome disruption, so it should be viewed as hypothesis-generating rather than practice-changing [^112vkvEr] [^113KMSdv] [^117PBTjP] [^114uF61r].

> I will now examine clinical presentation and ensure I capture the full spectrum. NEC often begins with nonspecific signs such as feeding intolerance, abdominal distension, apnea, temperature instability, and progresses in some to fulminant NEC with rapid shock and near-total bowel necrosis, in which mortality can approach 95% in reported series; importantly, term infants represent a minority and frequently have different triggers, such as congenital heart disease, suggesting a pathophysiologically distinct phenotype compared to classic preterm NEC [^112vkvEr] [^1129LDaq] [^115mA2Ms].

> Let me think about diagnostic approach and staging, and I should confirm limitations up front. Modified Bell staging integrates clinical, lab, and imaging findings, but inter-observer variability is substantial and formal staging often lags behind bedside risk assessment; CRP is sensitive but nonspecific, while thrombocytopenia and rising lactate correlate with severity, and emerging biomarkers like intestinal fatty acid–binding protein and S100A8/A9 show promise yet remain insufficiently validated for routine use, which means clinical integration must remain cautious [^112vkvEr] [^116wkdn6] [^115ZEZAo] [^111odtF5].

> Wait, I need to double-check imaging claims so I do not overstate radiography. Abdominal radiography remains the traditional first-line modality, with pneumatosis intestinalis, portal venous gas, and pneumoperitoneum as key signs; I initially called pneumatosis pathognomonic, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — although pneumatosis is historically considered hallmark, sensitivity is limited in ELBW infants and findings are transient, so it is better described as highly specific but imperfect, which is precisely why bowel ultrasound has emerged as a complementary tool that can detect wall perfusion, thickness, motility, pneumatosis, and small-volume free air in real time and may better identify necrotic segments to guide surgical timing [^114bXu5S] [^113Pq4Jo] [^116wkdn6] [^1151QYVH].

> I should confirm the evidence for predicting surgical NEC to avoid overreliance on unvalidated scores. Numerous tests and models have been proposed to distinguish medical from surgical NEC, but most lack internal or external validation; clinically, inotrope requirement, intubation, falling platelets, rising lactate, and imaging features such as fixed dilated loops or absent bowel perfusion raise concern, yet no universally accepted predictive model exists, and delays to surgery when deterioration is evident are associated with worse outcomes [^114vX7Yx] [^111oYawA] [^11527fDc].

> Let me verify medical management recommendations and ensure alignment with high-credibility guidance. For Bell stage I–II disease, management centers on bowel rest with nasogastric decompression, aggressive fluids and electrolyte correction, hemodynamic support, and total parenteral nutrition, with empiric broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics such as ampicillin plus gentamicin plus metronidazole or ampicillin plus cefotaxime plus metronidazole, or meropenem as a single agent when broader coverage is necessary, adding vancomycin if MRSA or resistant enterococcus is suspected and antifungals if fungal infection is documented or strongly suspected; early reintroduction of maternal breast milk after stabilization is protective, but wait, I should confirm durations — courses commonly range 7–14 days, tailored to clinical response and culture data [^114iQujg] [^1123odZc] [^111oYawA].

> I need to check surgical indications and strategies, making sure I distinguish absolute from relative triggers. Pneumoperitoneum remains an absolute indication for operative intervention, while relative indications include persistent clinical deterioration despite 24–48 hours of optimized medical therapy, severe acidosis, refractory thrombocytopenia, or imaging suggesting necrotic bowel; options include bedside peritoneal drainage for unstable ELBW infants and laparotomy with resection and stoma formation for definitive management, acknowledging that NEC-totalis carries a dismal prognosis and that delays to surgery in medically failing infants are linked to markedly worse outcomes [^111HWvLs] [^1129LDaq] [^11527fDc] [^1139BUb6].

> Next, I should review outcomes and follow-up so counseling is accurate. Mortality remains high overall and especially in ELBW and surgical cohorts, neurodevelopmental impairment and intestinal failure are not uncommon among survivors, and families report substantial long-term quality-of-life impacts; consensus for core outcomes in NEC trials now prioritizes mortality, NEC-related mortality, short bowel syndrome, quality of life, and neurodevelopmental impairment, and ERNICA emphasizes integrating neurodevelopmental risk into prognostic discussions [^112E6HRG] [^112J9VoJ] [^116Y7kBz] [^1146hy3M].

> But wait, what about prevention at the bedside today. Consistent protective effects are seen with maternal breast milk, standardized feeding protocols, and careful hemodynamic management, whereas the role of probiotics remains institution- and guideline-dependent; ASPEN's neonatal guidance judged the evidence insufficient for a blanket probiotic recommendation despite older trials suggesting benefit, likely reflecting heterogeneity in strains, dosing, and safety oversight, so local policy and risk–benefit assessment should guide use [^111oYawA] [^114ctFAL] [^111GVCKx] [^114EvC7V].

> I should double-check that I close with a pragmatic diagnostic–therapeutic flow that respects uncertainties. In a preterm infant with new abdominal distension, feeding intolerance, and apnea, I would obtain serial exams, labs including CBC, platelets, lactate, and CRP, start bowel rest with NG decompression and hemodynamic stabilization, initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics per local antibiogram, and obtain abdominal radiography with early adjunct bowel ultrasound if radiographs are equivocal or the infant is clinically worsening; I would reassess frequently with a low threshold to involve surgery, especially if inotropes are required, thrombocytopenia and lactate worsen, or ultrasound shows absent bowel perfusion, recognizing the lack of a validated single predictor and the harm associated with delayed operative management when deterioration is clear [^114bXu5S] [^113Pq4Jo] [^116mvn7n] [^11527fDc].

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe neonatal intestinal disease driven by **prematurity, formula feeding, and dysbiosis** [^113KMSdv] [^116qWisr] that trigger TLR4-mediated inflammation [^1153MLSw], barrier breakdown, and ischemia [^116XCaYf], leading to necrosis and perforation [^114uF61r]. It presents with **abdominal distension, feeding intolerance, and bloody stools** [^112vkvEr], with pneumatosis intestinalis on imaging [^1151QYVH]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical signs, labs (CBC, CRP, lactate), and abdominal radiography**, with ultrasound for equivocal cases [^116mvn7n] [^113Pq4Jo]. Management includes bowel rest, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and supportive care [^114iQujg] [^1123odZc]; surgery is indicated for perforation or clinical deterioration [^111HWvLs] [^1139BUb6]. Early recognition and intervention are critical to reduce high mortality and morbidity [^112E6HRG].

---

## Pathophysiology

NEC arises from a **multifactorial interplay** of intestinal immaturity, dysbiosis, and exaggerated innate immune signaling — especially TLR4 [^1153MLSw] — leading to barrier failure, inflammation, and ischemia [^116XCaYf] [^114uF61r].

- **Intestinal immaturity**: Premature infants have underdeveloped barriers and immune defenses [^114uF61r] [^115Wp3tj], increasing susceptibility to injury and infection.

- **Microbial dysbiosis**: Abnormal colonization with Proteobacteria [^114uF61r] and reduced commensals promotes inflammation and barrier breakdown [^116qWisr].

- **TLR4 signaling**: Elevated TLR4 in the premature gut [^1153MLSw] amplifies LPS-driven inflammation, apoptosis, and barrier loss [^113vN64e].

- **Ischemia and hypoxia**: Reduced perfusion from immature microvasculature [^116XCaYf] and hemodynamic instability exacerbates injury [^114uF61r].

---

## Causes and risk factors

NEC is associated with several **modifiable and non-modifiable** risk factors:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Prematurity | Major risk due to intestinal immaturity [^114uF61r] [^111SG9H2] |
| Formula feeding | Increases risk vs. breast milk [^113KMSdv] [^114fiF81] |
| Dysbiosis | Abnormal colonization with Proteobacteria [^114uF61r] [^116qWisr] |
| Hypoxia/ischemia | Reduced perfusion from immature microvasculature [^114uF61r] [^1153MLSw] |
| Sepsis | Systemic infection increases risk [^113KMSdv] [^111SG9H2] |
| Maternal factors | Chorioamnionitis; placental insufficiency [^11131U17] [^116DvyGe] |

---

## Clinical presentation

NEC typically presents within the first few weeks of life, especially in preterm infants [^112vkvEr], with **nonspecific symptoms that can progress rapidly**: early features include feeding intolerance, abdominal distension, vomiting, lethargy, temperature instability, apnea, and bradycardia [^116xKVA8], while **advanced signs** include bloody stools, abdominal discoloration, pneumatosis intestinalis, portal venous gas, and pneumoperitoneum [^1151QYVH].

---

## Diagnostic workup

Diagnosis relies on a combination of **clinical, laboratory, and imaging** findings:

- **Clinical assessment**: Detailed history and exam to identify risk factors and signs [^112vkvEr] [^116xKVA8].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, CRP, lactate, blood cultures to assess inflammation, perfusion, and infection [^115ZEZAo] [^112vkvEr] [^111odtF5].

- **Imaging**: Abdominal radiography for pneumatosis, portal venous gas, pneumoperitoneum [^1151QYVH]; ultrasound for equivocal cases or early detection [^113Pq4Jo].

---

## Treatment

Management depends on severity: **medical care for early disease** and surgery for advanced disease. Medical management consists of **bowel rest, gastric decompression, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and supportive care (fluids, electrolytes, nutrition)** [^114iQujg] [^1123odZc]. Surgical management is indicated for perforation, necrosis, or deterioration, with options including **laparotomy with resection, peritoneal drainage, or primary anastomosis** [^111HWvLs] [^1139BUb6].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

NEC carries high mortality (15–30%) [^112E6HRG] and significant morbidity, including **long-term complications** such as short bowel syndrome, growth failure, and neurodevelopmental impairment [^1129LDaq] [^1146hy3M]. Early recognition and intervention are critical to improving outcomes [^1139BUb6].

---

NEC is a multifactorial disease of prematurity driven by dysbiosis and TLR4-mediated inflammation, with **early recognition and intervention** essential to reduce its high mortality and morbidity [^116qWisr] [^1153MLSw].

### Clinical characteristics of necrotizing enterocolitis diagnosed by independent adjudication of abdominal radiographs, laparotomy, or autopsy in preterm infants in the "Connection Trial" [^112vkvEr]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a complex, multifactorial, and heterogeneous inflammatory disorder that occurs in approximately 5 to 10% of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. The global incidence seems to increase over time despite multiple improvements in neonatal intensive care, such as standardized feeding protocols promoting the use of mother's milk rather than infant formulas, antibiotic stewardship initiatives, and improved ventilation techniques. NEC is associated with clinically significant morbidities, and the mortality rate is approximately 20%, with rates up to approximately 35% in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants. Despite the significant adverse events (AEs) of NEC, no treatment nor prophylaxis for NEC have been evaluated in health authority-agreed drug development programs, leaving the disorder without any formally approved, specific medical therapy.

The diagnosis of NEC in VLBW infants most commonly occurs within 6–30 days of age, with a majority presenting before 34 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). In cases without a fulminant debut leading to early laparotomy or autopsy, NEC evaluation characteristically is initiated by the recognition of clinical signs of an intraabdominal complication, such as abdominal distension and discoloration, and radiological findings such as intestinal wall pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) and/or portal venous gas (PVG). Plain-film abdominal radiography is a classic modality for NEC recognition, though the image interpretation requires expertise and has been associated with both inter- and intraobserver variability.

### Bench to bedside - new insights into the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis [^1153MLSw]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the leading cause of death and disability from gastrointestinal disease in premature infants. Recent discoveries have shed light on a unifying theorem to explain the pathogenesis of NEC, suggesting that specific treatments might finally be forthcoming. A variety of experiments have highlighted how the interaction between bacterial signalling receptors on the premature intestine and an abnormal gut microbiota incites a pro-inflammatory response in the intestinal mucosa and its underlying endothelium that leads to NEC.

Central amongst the bacterial signalling receptors implicated in NEC development is the lipopolysaccharide receptor Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is expressed at higher levels in the premature gut than in the full-term gut. The high prenatal intestinal expression of TLR4 reflects the role of TLR4 in the regulation of normal gut development and supports additional studies indicating that NEC develops in response to signalling events that occur in utero.

This review provides new evidence explaining the pathogenesis of NEC, explores new findings indicating that NEC development has origins before birth, and discusses future questions and opportunities for discovery in this field.

### The role of ultrasound in necrotizing enterocolitis [^113Pq4Jo]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Ultrasound has proved to be a useful modality for enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of necrotizing enterocolitis and associated complications. The standard imaging algorithm for evaluating necrotizing enterocolitis includes radiographs and clinical symptoms, the combination of which constitutes the Bell criteria. Major limitations of using the Bell criteria for diagnosing and clinically managing necrotizing enterocolitis include the low diagnostic accuracy of radiographs and the nonspecific symptomatology of preterm infants. In this regard, ultrasound can offer additional insights into bowel health by helping to characterize bowel motility, echogenicity, thickness, pneumatosis, and perfusion. Extramural findings such as portal venous gas, the nature and extent of ascites, and pneumoperitoneum can also be assessed. Recently, contrast-enhanced ultrasound was explored in a case series of preterm bowel disease and its diagnostic utility warrants further investigation. This article reviews the ultrasound features of necrotizing enterocolitis and highlights the role of ultrasound as a complement to radiographs, as well as the emerging use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound in necrotizing enterocolitis.

### Advances in our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis [^114uF61r]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating gastrointestinal disease that usually afflicts premature neonates. However, less commonly, it may also occur in full-term infants. NEC typically develops following the initiation of feeding in the predisposed newborn and progresses from a localized gastrointestinal infection to overwhelming inflammation, pneumatosis, intestinal perforation, sepsis, and even death. As our understanding of NEC has grown, there have been advances in both therapeutic and prophylactic management strategies, resulting in a modest improvement in the survival rate of patients with NEC.

Despite significant strides in our knowledge of the pathogenesis of NEC, gaps remain due to the complex and multifactorial nature of the disease. Recent advances in molecular biology have been employed by investigators to study NEC. These techniques have provided new insights, which will be discussed in this review.

- **Understanding of the pathogenesis of NEC**: The greatest risk factors for NEC are prematurity, abnormal bacterial colonization, ischemia, and formula-feeding. In recent years, data supports the theory that immaturity of the immune system and an imbalance of inflammatory mediators play a significant role in susceptibility to NEC. These factors most likely contribute to permeability, ischemic injury, and intestinal barrier breakdown. Currently, there is no cure for NEC, and the most effective treatment remains elusive.

### Risk factors for necrotizing enterocolitis: A prospective multicenter case-control study [^113KMSdv]. Neonatology (2018). Low credibility.

The identification of independent clinical risk factors for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) may contribute to early selection of infants at risk, allowing for the development of targeted strategies aimed at the prevention of NEC.

- **Objective**: The objective of this study was to identify independent risk factors contributing to the development of NEC in a large multicenter cohort.

- **Methods**: This prospective cohort study was performed in nine neonatal intensive care units. Infants born at a gestational age ≤ 30 weeks were included. Demographic and clinical data were collected daily until day 28 postnatally. Factors predictive of the development of NEC were identified using univariate and multivariable analyses in a 1:5 matched case-control cohort.

- **Results**: A total of 843 infants (56 NEC cases) were included in this study. In the case-control cohort, univariate analysis identified sepsis prior to the onset of NEC and formula feeding to be associated with an increased risk of developing NEC, whereas the administration of antibiotics directly postpartum was inversely associated with NEC. In a multivariable logistic regression model, enteral feeding type and the number of days parenterally fed remained statistically significantly associated with NEC, whereas the administration of antibiotics directly after birth was associated with a lower risk of developing NEC.

- **Conclusions**: Formula feeding and prolonged parenteral feeding were associated with an increased risk of NEC. Contrary to expectations, the initiation of treatment with antibiotics within 24 hours after birth was associated with a lower risk of NEC.

Regarding surgical interventions for necrotizing enterocolitis, specifically with respect to peritoneal drainage and laparotomy, the IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend performing urgent or emergent operative intervention, such as laparotomy or percutaneous drainage, in neonates with necrotizing enterocolitis when there is evidence of bowel perforation. Additionally, it is advised to obtain intraoperative Gram stains and cultures.

### The role of imaging in the management of necrotising enterocolitis: A multispecialist survey and a review of the literature [^114cSGUL]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Signs stated in free text were echogenicity of the intestinal wall, bowel motility, amount and location of fluid collections, and "zebra sign", all of which are thought to be covered by the response alternatives above.

Fourteen percent of neonatologists stated that all clinicians at their department do abdominal US and 32% that some do. Where at least some clinicians performed US, 47% had support from the radiology department in the evaluation of the results — pictures (18%), cine loops (12%), or both (18%).

Fifty-one percent (40–63%) of radiologists, compared to 20% (14–28%) of clinicians, rejected the idea that clinicians who do not do ultrasound should learn it, p < 0.001.

- **Repeated imaging**: There was considerable variation in examination frequency; see Fig. 4. The frequency was usually decided individually, but 61% sometimes used a fixed schedule, and 10% always did. Sixty-three percent stated that radiation might be a concern. Whether NEC was confirmed or not, around 90% would at least sometimes use the same modality for repeated imaging. See supplementary Table S3.

### Contemporary outcomes for infants with necrotizing enterocolitis-a systematic review [^112E6HRG]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

To develop an accurate understanding of outcomes for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) to inform parental counseling, clinical care, and research agendas, a systematic review was conducted. This review focused on recent large cohort studies from January 2010 to January 2018 that reported outcomes of infants who developed NEC. Only studies reporting national, regional, or multicenter outcomes of NEC in high-income countries were included. The outcomes assessed were mortality, neurodevelopmental outcome, and intestinal failure. Meta-analyses were employed to generate summary statistics for these outcomes.

Of 1375 abstracts, 38 articles were included. The overall mortality rate was 23.5% in all neonates with confirmed NEC (Bell stage 2a+) with a 95% CI of 18.5%-28.8%. Mortality was 34.5% (30.1%-39.2%) for neonates that underwent surgery for NEC, 40.5% (37.2%-43.8%) for extremely low birthweight infants (< 1000 g), and 50.9% (38.1%-63.5%) for extremely low birthweight infants with surgical NEC. Studies examining causes of neonatal mortality indicate that NEC is responsible for approximately 1 in 10 of all neonatal deaths. Neurodevelopmental disability was reported in four studies, with rates between 24.8% and 61.1% across 1209 total NEC cases. Three studies reported intestinal failure with an incidence of 15.2%-35.0% (n = 1370). The main limitation of this review is the lack of an agreed-upon definition for diagnosing NEC and the differences in reporting outcomes.

Mortality following NEC remains high. These contemporary data inform clinical care and justify ongoing research efforts. All infants with NEC should receive long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up.

### Necrotising enterocolitis [^116zriT4]. Lancet (2006). Low credibility.

Necrotising enterocolitis is one of the most common gastrointestinal emergencies in newborn infants. This text reviews the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and pathophysiology of the disease, along with strategies for diagnosis, management, and prevention. It is a devastating and unpredictable disease affecting premature infants. Despite decades of research, its pathogenesis remains unclear; diagnosis can be difficult, and treatment is challenging. An improved understanding of intestinal defenses in premature infants, dietary and bacterial factors, and genetic effects that could predispose infants to necrotising enterocolitis is necessary before developing new strategies for prevention and treatment.

### Maternal, neonatal, and nutritional risk factors for medical and surgical necrotizing enterocolitis [^111oYawA]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To identify maternal and neonatal risk factors associated with progression to surgery or death after diagnosis of NEC.

- **Study design**: Forty-seven demographic and clinical factors were evaluated across 216 validated cases of NEC occurring between 2010 and 2020. Nutrition at NEC onset was evaluated in 149 cases. The binary outcome of surgical NEC (progressing to surgery or death) vs. medical NEC (resolved with antibiotics/bowel rest) was compared across variables.

- **Results**: Elevated CRP, rapidly decreasing platelet counts, inotropic medication, intubation, and positive blood cultures within 24 hours of diagnosis were associated with progression to surgery/death. Infants with surgical NEC had higher abdominal circumferences at birth. Maternal milk intake and receipt of human milk fortifiers were associated with medical NEC, with infants receiving fortified maternal milk showing the lowest progression to surgery/death.

- **Conclusion**: The index of suspicion should be heightened for surgical NEC when these risk factors are present.

### Necrotizing enterocolitis: Perspectives from a population-based study [^114vX7Yx]. Pediatric Research (2025). High credibility.

Moving beyond associations to developing a predictive model or identifying value cut-offs in variables that may accurately predict an event is a challenge addressed across all areas of medical research, including NEC. In NEC, there is growing interest in being able to distinguish infants with surgical NEC from infants with medical NEC early in their disease course. A recent systematic review found 114 reports of 63 unique tests to identify surgical NEC, with an exponential growth in publications in recent years. Many tests were derived in single-centre datasets without internal validation. Hence, further work, externally validating existing methods, is much awaited.

There were 47 infants (6.5%) in this study by Kim et al. who died of NEC prior to surgical intervention taking place. Battersby et al. reported data from a UK-based neonatal dataset and found that this rate was higher (21%) with slightly different inclusion criteria, which were infants < 32 weeks CGA with severe NEC, defined as NEC confirmed at laparotomy or death attributed to NEC. These figures are a reminder that we urgently need to better understand which infants should be transferred to surgical neonatal units and which criteria indicate referral to the surgical team. To achieve this, we need to identify infants early in their disease course that are likely to deteriorate or not respond to medical therapy. As such, the variables identified by Kim and colleagues as being associated with surgical NEC could be considered for this purpose. However, any changes to referral criteria must be carefully balanced against the [content is incomplete].

### Risk factors for necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates: A systematic review of prognostic studies [^116DvyGe]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Well-designed prospective prognostic studies are needed, with detailed reporting on definitions, methods, and measurement of prognostic factors and outcomes. Special attention should be given to the timing of exposures in relation to the diagnosis of NEC. It would be interesting not only to focus on patient factors but also on maternal factors. Maternal lifestyle factors, such as smoking and obesity; morbidity, such as diabetes, preeclampsia, and chorioamnionitis; and prenatal medication, such as antibiotics and corticosteroids, may also be relevant risk factors for NEC.

A second step is the development and validation of a prediction model to quantify individual risk profiles and identify patients at risk. Until now, this has only been performed by Gephart et al, who developed a model based on a large set of retrospective data. Their model still needs external validation in other neonatal populations to evaluate its general clinical usefulness. In our opinion, the development and validation of prospective prediction models are still necessary for preventive strategies and future reduction of the incidence of NEC.

### Fulminant necrotizing enterocolitis: Clinical features and a predictive model [^1129LDaq]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating gastrointestinal disease and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among premature neonates. Despite advancements in perinatal medicine, the mortality rate of NEC remains high, ranging from 15 to 30%. Furthermore, survivors of NEC, particularly those who have undergone intestinal surgery, face an increased risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.

In recent years, clinicians have become increasingly concerned with a subset of "severe" NEC cases. Though relatively rare, these cases are noteworthy due to their catastrophic outcomes, such as rapid death or "NEC-totalis". Definitions of fulminant necrotizing enterocolitis (fNEC) and NEC-totalis vary widely in the literature. However, these severe NEC cases do share certain common characteristics.

In this study, fNEC was defined as cases progressing to death within 48 hours or presenting with NEC-totalis (massive, near-total bowel ischemia and necrosis) during surgery. According to Hartman's study, the mortality rate among fNEC neonates was reported to be as high as 95.7%. Compared to non-fulminant NEC (nNEC), fNEC cases tend to exhibit more critical and progressive features with poorer outcomes. Given the distinct nature of this NEC subtype, delineating specific clinical features and constructing a predictive nomogram for fNEC hold significant value. The objective of this study was to summarize the clinical characteristics of fNEC and develop a nomogram model to assist clinicians in predicting fNEC.

### Necrotising enterocolitis in adults: a rare occurrence [^113gY359]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening condition predominantly affecting preterm neonates. In contrast to well-characterized neonatal forms, adult NEC (ANEC) is a rare entity. Early diagnosis is crucial, as NEC carries a high mortality rate if left untreated. This report describes a man in his 80s presenting with acute abdomen, subsequently diagnosed as ANEC. This case emphasizes diagnostic challenges and highlights the key differences between the neonatal and adult forms of the disease. This case contributes to the limited literature on ANEC, supporting the need for early diagnosis and management of this rare condition in adults.

### Risk factors for necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates: A systematic review of prognostic studies [^114fiF81]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the most severe complications of preterm birth, occurring in 5–10% of very low birth weight infants. Although more preterm infants are surviving, the number of deaths attributed to NEC has been increasing, with reported mortality rates ranging from 15% to 30%. Surgical treatment is often necessary, and survivors face an increased risk for poor long-term growth and neurodevelopmental impairment. Despite preventive strategies such as prenatal glucocorticoid administration, breastfeeding, use of donor milk, and probiotic supplementation, NEC remains relatively common in most neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).

NEC is difficult to predict in individual cases, as its etiology is complex and multifactorial. Factors include genetic predisposition, intestinal immaturity, imbalance in microvascular tone, abnormal microbial colonization, and a highly immune-reactive intestinal mucosa. These elements converge in a common inflammatory pathway, leading to intestinal ischemia, pneumatosis, necrosis, and eventually perforation.

Many observational studies have reported clinical and non-clinical risk factors associated with NEC, but the prognostic value is usually unclear. Most of these studies were not designed to properly address prognostic questions. To identify independent risk factors for a complex disease like NEC, a (preferably prospective) prognostic cohort design with multivariable analysis including multiple co-variates is considered most appropriate. The aim of this study was to provide a systematic review of the literature on prognostic studies reporting these factors.

### European reference network for inherited and congenital anomalies evidence-based guideline on surgical aspects of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature neonates [^1139BUb6]. Neonatology (2025). High credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe intestinal disease, with a mortality rate of around 25% for all patients with confirmed NEC. Mortality rates are rising for patients with a birthweight below 1,500 g (30%) and for those requiring surgical intervention (35%). NEC primarily affects very preterm infants and/or those with an extremely low birthweight. The lower the gestational age, the higher the risk of both NEC and complicated NEC, which is defined as NEC requiring surgery for survival. Approximately 15% of all neonates born with a gestational age of less than 26 weeks develop NEC.

The European Reference Network for Inherited and Congenital Anomalies (ERNICA) is the ERN for rare inherited and congenital digestive disorders, including NEC. To our knowledge, no systematically developed guidelines exist to assist clinical decision-making for NEC. Therefore, we aimed to develop such a guideline for the treatment of surgical NEC, specifically for preterm neonates with a confirmed diagnosis (based on clinical symptoms and/or pneumatosis intestinalis on imaging, Modified Bell's classification stage IIa and higher). This guideline seeks to address important questions regarding the surgical treatment, management, and prognosis of preterm neonates with a NEC diagnosis. By doing so, it aims to support healthcare providers and parents in making informed decisions about the care of these babies while highlighting evidence gaps and promoting a research agenda. We aim to set a standard for treatment and care pathways to benefit preterm neonates with NEC.

### Necrotizing enterocolitis: A clinical review on diagnostic biomarkers and the role of the intestinal microbiota [^115gshp7]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains one of the most frequent gastrointestinal diseases in the neonatal intensive care unit, with unacceptably high mortality and morbidity rates. Up to 20% to 40% of infants with NEC will need surgical intervention at some point. Although the exact pathophysiology is not yet elucidated, prematurity, use of formula feeding, and an altered intestinal microbiota are supposed to induce an inflammatory response of the immature intestine. The clinical picture of NEC has been well described; however, early diagnosis and differentiation from sepsis are challenging. Additionally, it is difficult to timely identify NEC cases that will deteriorate and need surgical intervention. This may interfere with the most optimal treatment of infants with NEC.

In this review, we discuss the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of NEC, with a focus on the role of microbiota in the development of NEC. An overview of different clinical prediction models and biomarkers is given. Some of these are promising tools for the accurate diagnosis of NEC and the selection of appropriate therapy.

### The role of imaging in the management of necrotising enterocolitis: a multispecialist survey and a review of the literature [^114bXu5S]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), a potentially devastating intestinal inflammation in neonates, has developed alongside neonatal intensive care. With improving survival of the most premature neonates, the epidemiological and pathophysiological landscape keeps shifting, and the need to differentiate between NEC of different origins has been pointed out. Except for a general agreement that NEC should be differentiated from spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP), it is not settled whether to aim at a narrower definition of NEC or a subclassification. Suggested differential diagnoses include viral enteritis of infancy, feeding intolerance of prematurity, cow milk's protein allergy, ischaemic bowel disease due to cardiac anomalies, and Hirschsprung's disease. Factors suggested to aid the differential diagnosis are gestational age (GA), age at onset, feeding volumes, clinical symptoms, stool cultures, blood cultures, and some laboratory tests.

Subtle radiographic signs of early NEC may appear before clinical signs and progress ahead of clinical deterioration, but the hallmarks of NEC, pneumatosis intestinalis (PI), and portal venous gas (PVG), are often transient, with pneumoperitoneum (PP) frequently missing in spite of intestinal perforation. The overall sensitivity of abdominal radiography (AR) is low, especially in extremely low birth weight infants. Based on these insights, together with reports of ultrasound (US) for early detection of PVG and evaluation of mesenteric circulation, a standardised algorithm for early diagnosis and evaluation of progress is recommended.

### Bowel ultrasound for predicting surgical management of necrotizing enterocolitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1143aL7F]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

This meta-analysis has several limitations. The majority of included studies were retrospective observational cohorts, which may overestimate the strength of association between US findings and outcomes in NEC. The wide confidence intervals in some point estimates also suggest small sample sizes and lack of homogeneity across studies. Publication bias, where only positive studies are reported in the literature, could also have influenced the results of this review, although we sought to systematically search the gray literature for unpublished studies.

There was considerable variation among the different studies. As a result, we were often only able to analyze data from at most seven studies at once, despite identifying 11 studies of interest. Some studies reported on bowel US performed in infants with suspected NEC, while others included only infants with definite NEC (Modified Bell's stage 2–3). In some studies, bowel US was part of routine evaluation for NEC, while in others, bowel US was used selectively per clinical discretion.

Although variation among the different studies is an important limitation and potential source of bias, such differences also closely reflect clinical practice. Indications for surgical intervention were also not clearly delineated and likely varied between studies. A potential bias exists in that US results may have contributed to decisions to perform surgery. Comparison to objective surgical or pathological findings was not possible because these findings were not reported in the source studies. Studies were also conducted over the course of time, which could introduce additional variables impacting the results.

### Necrotizing enterocolitis: The mystery goes on [^114mmVxt]. Neonatology (2014). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) has been a prevalent condition in neonatal intensive care units for the past 60 years. Its prevalence has paralleled the advancement and sophistication of neonatal intensive care. Despite significant efforts to eliminate it, NEC persists and appears to be increasing in some centers. The pathophysiology of this disease remains poorly understood.

Several issues have hindered our quest to develop a better understanding of NEC. One major challenge is that what we have historically termed 'NEC' seems to encompass several various diseases. Animal models commonly used to study NEC pathophysiology and treatment do not accurately reflect the most common form of the disease observed in human infants. It appears that the pathophysiology is multifactorial, involving several different pathways leading to intestinal necrosis with various inciting factors.

- **NEC classifications**: Spontaneous intestinal perforations, ischemic bowel disease secondary to cardiac anomalies, and other conditions distinct from the most common form of NEC seen in preterm infants have been grouped in the same database.

Here, I describe some of the different forms of what has been termed NEC and provide insights into its pathophysiology, where available studies suggest the involvement of genetic factors, intestinal immaturity, hemodynamic instability, inflammation, and a dysbiotic microbial ecology.

- **Diagnosis and innovation**: Currently used approaches for the diagnosis of NEC are presented, and innovative technologies for the development of diagnostic and predictive biomarkers are described.

### Methods of identifying surgical necrotizing enterocolitis-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11527fDc]. Pediatric Research (2025). Low credibility.

A quarter of babies with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) will require surgery due to bowel perforation, suspected bowel necrosis, or failure to improve from medical treatment alone. In those that do undergo laparotomy, the most common finding is ischaemic, non-viable gut, which requires resection. In 1-in-20 surgical procedures, the extent of the non-viable gut means that survival is not possible. Additionally, population-based data demonstrate that 20% of infants with NEC die without having a surgical procedure. It is possible that some of these deaths might be avoidable, and findings at surgery may be less advanced with earlier recognition of the disease. Hence, earlier escalation of treatment, including surgery, has the potential to interrupt the inflammatory cascade through resection of necrotic bowel. Given that existing data suggest that treatment delay is associated with worse outcomes, we hypothesize that earlier identification of the need for treatment escalation, including surgery, in infants with NEC is likely to improve the currently unfavorable outcomes.

A recent analysis of a population-based dataset of infants with surgical NEC explored the relationship between the indication for surgery, timing of surgery, and outcomes. This revealed that babies who have subjectively been felt to have failed medical management have surgery 30 hours later than babies who have a more definite indication for surgery (i.e. the presence of pneumoperitoneum). This delay to surgical intervention was associated with a 4.5 times greater risk of poor outcome, including death or the requirement for parental care.

### Long-term follow-up of patients with necrotizing enterocolitis [^116SMGPn]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Despite the rise in the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), there is a paucity of data regarding long-term patient outcomes. The authors examined the functional outcomes of infants with NEC (n = 103) treated at our institution between 1991 and 1995.

- **Methods**: The authors reviewed the medical records of infants who were treated both operatively and nonoperatively, totaling 103 patients. Variables examined included gestational age, birth weight, Bell stage (I through III), operations performed, and mortality rate. Telephone interviews assessed school enrollment, developmental delay, bowel function, and nutritional status.

- **Results**: Children treated operatively had a lower gestational age than those in the nonoperative group. Likewise, birth weight in the operative group was significantly lower. Sixty-three percent of patients had stage III, and the remainder had stage II disease. The telephone response rate was 61%. The mean age at follow-up was 7.5 ± 2.5 years. All children ate by mouth. Nearly all children were toilet-trained. All children were less than the 50th percentile for height and weight, and the majority (83%) were enrolled in school full-time.

- **Conclusion**: Infants with stage II and III NEC who are treated operatively or nonoperatively have a favorable long-term outcome.

### The role of imaging in the management of necrotising enterocolitis: A multispecialist survey and a review of the literature [^111qFQYu]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

In the differential diagnosis, the clinical picture was almost unanimously regarded as the most important aspect, and it is well known that suspected NEC patients are usually treated for NEC, regardless of any formal criteria for diagnosis and staging, and may even be operated on if their clinical state is severe enough.

The decision on surgery is a balancing act between early intervention to prevent progression of disease and avoidance of unnecessary surgery, with considerable variation in the readiness to intervene. One respondent commented that many babies tolerate a pneumoperitoneum very well, but the opinion that surgical management becomes necessary in persistent PI at 48 hours was also expressed. Even if imaging is perceived to be important for confirming the diagnosis, its most important role may be for the timing of surgery, and reported results on the potential of US to bridge the lack of sensitivity of AR for intestinal perforation and bowel necrosis are promising.

The ability of US to detect smaller amounts of intraperitoneal gas, presumably from contained or self-limiting perforations, may partly explain that respondents perceived PP differently when detected with US than on AR. In contrast, complex ascites is also indicative of perforation and could be expected to prompt surgery more often than reported. Experience of ultrasound in NEC seems to influence the evaluation of US signs.

The distribution of opinions on persistent loop on sequential radiographs and portal venous gas on AR as indications for surgery is similar to the equivocal results in the literature.

### Characteristics of patients who die of necrotizing enterocolitis [^115YKZQ9]. Journal of Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a common cause of morbidity in infants born prematurely. Our understanding of predictors of NEC outcomes has been limited at the time of writing, and we do not have a full understanding of why some patients die and others do not. Rapidly progressive NEC that results in complete bowel necrosis in an otherwise well infant is poorly understood and not well described in the literature. Some cases progress so quickly that they may never make it to surgery, making the distinctions of medical and surgical NEC inadequate surrogates for severity of illness. The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors associated with NEC mortality and specifically to delineate the difference between infants who die within 7 days of diagnosis from those that die later.

### Challenge in diagnosis of late onset necrotizing enterocolitis in a term infant: a case report [^116urBis]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a common, devastating inflammatory gastrointestinal disease and frequently occurs in premature infants. Here, we report a case of late-onset NEC in a term neonate with a good outcome after surgery and long-term follow-up.

- **Case presentation**: A ten-week-old male presented to the emergency unit with prolonged diarrhea and abdominal distention. He was born at a gestational age of 40 weeks, with a birth weight of 2800 g and an Apgar score of 7/8, respectively. He had no history of formula feeding. Two weeks before admission to the hospital, the patient experienced frequent diarrhea with fever. He was lethargic with abdominal distention, absence of bowel sounds, and abdominal tenderness. A plain abdominal x-ray and CT scan revealed gastric and intestinal dilatation and a gasless colon, suggesting a small bowel obstruction and bowel wall thickening indicative of peritonitis, with no evidence of free subdiaphragmatic air (pneumoperitoneum). Importantly, the patient did not have congenital heart disease. Despite intensive medical treatment, he showed continuous clinical deterioration. All findings suggested intestinal inflammation with clinical decline, leading to a decision to perform an emergency exploratory laparotomy. During the procedure, ischemia was observed along the jejunoileal segment, with a perforation located 25 cm above the ileocecal valve. A double-barrel ileostomy was performed through a separate incision from the laparotomy. Histopathological findings confirmed the diagnosis of NEC. The stoma was closed on postoperative day 43, and the patient was discharged uneventfully.

### A simple presurgical necrotizing enterocolitis-mortality scoring system [^116mvn7n]. Journal of Perinatology (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between early laboratory parameters, disease severity, type of management (surgical or conservative), and outcome in necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).

- **Study design**: This was a retrospective collection and analysis of data from infants treated in a single tertiary care center between 1980 and 2002. Data were collected on disease severity (Bell stage), birth weight (BW), gestational age (GA), and pre-intervention laboratory parameters such as leukocyte and platelet counts, hemoglobin, lactate, and C-reactive protein.

- **Results**: Data from 128 infants were sufficient for analysis. Factors significantly associated with survival included Bell stage (P < 0.05), lactate (P < 0.05), BW, and GA (P < 0.01, P < 0.001, respectively). From receiver operating characteristics curves, the highest predictive value resulted from a score with 0 to 8 points combining BW, Bell stage, lactate, and platelet count (P < 0.001). At a cutoff level of 4.5, sensitivity and specificity for predicting survival were 0.71 and 0.72, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: Some single parameters were associated with poor outcomes in NEC. Optimal risk stratification was achieved by combining several parameters into a scoring system.

### New insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of necrotizing enterocolitis: Toll-like receptors and beyond [^114GTdYJ]. Pediatric Research (2011). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the leading cause of death from gastrointestinal disease in preterm infants. The dismal results of treatment for NEC highlight the urgent need for a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease and the importance of discovering novel, molecular-specific therapies for it. Dogma indicates that the development of NEC reflects an abnormal response by the premature infant to the microbial flora that colonizes the gastrointestinal tract, although the mechanisms mediating these abnormal bacterial-enterocyte interactions and the reasons for the increased susceptibility of the premature infant to the development of NEC remain incompletely explained.

Recent evidence has shed light on an emerging role for the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) of the innate immune system as central players in the pathways that signal in response to enteric bacteria, resulting in the development of NEC. We now review recent advances in the field of NEC and identify several exciting potential avenues for novel treatments by focusing on abnormal TLR4 signaling in the premature intestine in the pathogenesis of NEC. In so doing, we seek to offer new hope to the patients and their families who are affected by this devastating disorder.

### Core outcome set for necrotizing enterocolitis treatment trials [^112J9VoJ]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Variability in outcome reporting in necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) treatment trials hinders conducting meta-analyses and implementing novel treatments. We aimed to develop a core outcome set (COS) for NEC treatment trials, including outcome measures most relevant to patients and physicians, from NEC diagnosis to adulthood.

- **Methods**: Clinicians and/or researchers from low-middle- and high-income countries were approached based on their scientific contributions to NEC literature, and patients and parents through local organizations. We presented participants with 45 outcomes used in NEC research, identified through a systematic review. To achieve consensus, outcomes were rated on a scale of 1 to 9 in three online Delphi rounds and discussed at a final consensus meeting.

- **Results**: Seventy-one participants from 25 countries completed all Delphi rounds, including 15 patients and family representatives. Thirteen outcomes reached consensus in one of the stakeholder groups and were included in the consensus meeting; 6 outcomes reached consensus in both groups. Twenty-seven participants from both high- and low-middle-income countries attended the online consensus meeting, including family representatives and NEC patients. After discussion and a final vote, 5 outcomes reached consensus to be included: mortality, NEC-related mortality, short bowel syndrome, quality of life, and neurodevelopmental impairment.

- **Conclusions**: This NEC COS includes 5 predominantly long-term outcomes agreed upon by clinicians, patients, and family representatives. Use of this international COS will standardize outcome reporting, enhancing the ability to compare and implement novel treatments effectively.

### Necrotizing enterocolitis and the microbiome: Current status and future directions [^116qWisr]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Decades of research have failed to define the pathophysiology of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a devastating pediatric gastrointestinal disorder of preterm infants. However, evidence suggests that host-microbiota interactions, in which microbial dysbiosis is followed by loss of barrier integrity, inflammation, and necrosis, are central to NEC development. Thus, greater knowledge of the preterm infant microbiome could accelerate attempts to diagnose, treat, and prevent NEC.

In this article, we summarize clinical characteristics of and risk factors for NEC, the structure of the pre-event NEC microbiome, how this community interfaces with host immunology, and microbiome-based approaches that might prevent or lessen the severity of NEC in this very vulnerable population.

### Risk factors for necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates: A systematic review of prognostic studies [^117PBTjP]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

It is concluded that high-quality studies on prognostic factors for NEC are rare. Several prognostic factors are associated with NEC, of which not all are necessarily causal. Ruling out factors is hampered by incomplete reporting. Future high-quality prognostic (and predictive) research is necessary to enable clinicians to identify patients at high risk for NEC.

### The role of imaging in the management of necrotising enterocolitis: A multispecialist survey and a review of the literature [^1151QYVH]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

To investigate practices and perceptions of imaging in necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) according to involved specialists, this study aimed to position these findings within the context of existing literature and identify areas requiring further investigation.

Two hundred two neonatologists, pediatric surgeons, and radiologists participated in a web-based questionnaire regarding imaging practices for NEC at their respective hospitals. The results were descriptively analyzed using proportion estimates with 95% confidence intervals.

There was over 90% agreement on the value of imaging for confirming the diagnosis, monitoring, and guiding decisions on surgery, as well as recognizing abdominal radiography as the first-choice modality and identifying the most important radiographic signs. More variation was observed regarding some indications for surgery and the usage of certain ultrasonographic signs. Fifty-eight percent of participants indicated that ultrasound was used for NEC at their hospital. The frequency of examination, often once daily or more with considerable variation, and the projections used in abdominal radiography were usually decided individually rather than according to fixed schedules. Predicting the need for surgery was considered more important than formal staging.

Despite the significant agreement on the purposes of imaging in NEC and the most critical radiographic signs of the disease, there was considerable diversity in routines, especially concerning examination frequency and the use of ultrasound. Future studies should focus on continuing validation of ultrasound and defining the supplementary roles of various imaging modalities.

### Risk factors for necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates: A systematic review of prognostic studies [^113Ak33b]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: This systematic review was guided by the PRISMA Statement, a 27-item checklist designed to improve the reporting of systematic reviews. A search strategy was developed with the assistance of a clinical librarian and implemented across databases such as PubMed, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Google Scholar. The initial search was conducted in January 2014 and updated in August 2016, using terms related to necrotizing enterocolitis, intestinal perforation, neonates, birth weight, gestation, prediction, prognosis, epidemiology, and risk factors. The complete search strategy is documented as supplemental material (Additional file 1). References of included studies were reviewed to identify additional eligible studies.

Studies were included for analysis if they met all of the following criteria: (1) full publications written in English, (2) utilizing a prospective or retrospective cohort study design or a nested case-control design, (3) identifying prognostic factors for NEC (primary or secondary outcome) in neonatal or non-neonatal populations, (4) using multivariable data analysis with more than two covariates, and (5) involving a study population of neonates/newborns, preterm infants, very low birth weight (VLBW), or extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants. The explicit use of the term "prognostic" was not required for inclusion.

Studies were excluded if they (1) only reported on associative models involving one or two variables with NEC (even if adjustments for potential confounders were performed), or (2) focused solely on risk factors for abdominal conditions other than NEC, such as spontaneous focal intestinal perforation, viral enteritis, and allergic conditions.

### Pathogenesis of NEC: Role of the innate and adaptive immune response [^115Wp3tj]. Seminars in Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease in premature infants, characterized by high case fatality and significant morbidity among survivors. The immaturity of intestinal host defenses predisposes the premature infant gut to injury. An abnormal bacterial colonization pattern, along with a deficiency of commensal bacteria, may lead to a further breakdown of these host defense mechanisms, making infants more susceptible to NEC. Here, we review the role of the innate and adaptive immune system in the pathophysiology of NEC.

### Necrotizing enterocolitis: recent scientific advances in pathophysiology and prevention [^116awNXZ]. Seminars in Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. This review explores the epidemiology and pathophysiology of NEC, emphasizing the latest research findings and potential future research areas. NEC remains one of the most devastating and unpredictable diseases affecting premature infants. Despite decades of research, the pathogenesis of this disease is unclear, and both prevention and treatment strategies are limited. Hopefully, future studies focused on understanding premature intestinal defenses, commensal or probiotic bacterial influences, and possible genetic predisposition will improve prevention and treatment strategies.

### New insights into necrotizing enterocolitis: From laboratory observation to personalized prevention and treatment [^113vN64e]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease of prematurity that develops after feeding, often without warning, and results in diffuse intestinal necrosis leading to sepsis and death in many cases. The lack of improvement in overall survival is influenced by nonspecific diagnostic modalities as well as inexact and nonpersonalized treatment strategies.

Recently, we and others have shown that NEC develops in response to exaggerated bacterial signaling in the premature intestine, as a consequence of elevated expression and activity of the bacterial receptor toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is important for normal gut development. Breast milk is a powerful TLR4 inhibitor, while mutations in TLR4 genes lead to increased NEC risk in humans, providing proof-of-concept for its role in NEC. Recently, a drug discovery approach has revealed a novel class of TLR4 inhibitors which are being developed for personalized approaches to NEC treatment.

This review will highlight the understanding of the role of bacterial signaling in NEC pathogenesis and will describe advances in diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of NEC that may hopefully improve survival for these most fragile patients.

Neutropenic enterocolitis is a necrotizing inflammatory process with intramural infection that occurs predominantly in neutropenic patients. This syndrome is most frequently observed after chemotherapy for hematologic and solid tissue malignancies, but it can also be observed in a number of other clinical settings. Neutropenic enterocolitis can be a rare presenting complication of acute leukemia. We report a case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia that presented with abdominal pain due to neutropenic enterocolitis. The diagnostic and treatment challenges associated with this manner of presentation are discussed.

### Long-term outcomes and life-impacts of necrotizing enterocolitis: A survey of survivors and parents [^116Y7kBz]. Seminars in Perinatology (2023). High credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating intestinal disease that primarily affects premature infants. It is associated with adverse two-year outcomes, yet limited research has evaluated the impact of NEC on long-term complications and quality of life in children older than two years. We conducted a survey to characterize the long-term impact of NEC on physical and mental health, social experiences, and quality of life as self-reported by adult NEC survivors and parents of children who survived NEC. To our knowledge, this is the first study that describes the lived experience of NEC survivors and parents of children affected by NEC to understand their experiences years after the original diagnosis. Our survey results indicate that NEC survivors and parents of children affected by NEC experience long-term complications that impact their physical and mental health, social experiences, and quality of life.

### Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis: an overview [^116AqLAY]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis represents a disease entity that remains quite challenging for neonatologists all around the world, in that its aetiology has yet to be revealed. It is the cause of death for many premature infants each year, affecting up to 28% of very low birthweight infants. This overview aims to improve the management of affected babies and stimulate more research concerning new diagnostic tools.

- **Recent findings**: Trends in the field of early diagnosis include imaging techniques such as contrast radiography, portal vein ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and radionuclide scanning. Gastrointestinal tonometry and the detection of biochemical markers, cytokines, and growth factors are also discussed. The determination of the mean peak hydrogen-to-carbon dioxide ratio excreted in breath is noted as well. Various novel preventive techniques are presented, with products like platelet-activating factor acetyl hydrolase activity enhancement, platelet-activating factor receptor antagonists, and probiotics such as Bifidobacterium infantis and Lactobacillus acidophilus showing promise. Regarding treatment, the use of oxygenated perfluorocarbon has added to the limited alternatives available. These data, along with other recent discoveries concerning the risk factors and pathogenesis of this disease, create a comprehensive picture of the current opinion on this topic.

Keeping in mind that the key to confronting such a devastating disorder as necrotizing enterocolitis is early diagnosis and prevention, ongoing clinical research and application are crucial in addressing this condition effectively.

Vancomycin should be considered over ampicillin for suspected MRSA or ampicillin-resistant enterococcal infections. If the Gram stain or cultures of specimens obtained during operation indicate a fungal infection, fluconazole or amphotericin B should be administered.

### Challenge in diagnosis of late onset necrotizing enterocolitis in a term infant: a case report [^1126u5Ck]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a common, devastating inflammatory gastrointestinal disease and frequently occurs in premature infants. Here, we reported a case of late-onset NEC in a term neonate with a good outcome after surgery for long-term follow-up.

- **Case presentation**: A ten-week-old male presented to the emergency unit due to prolonged diarrhea and abdominal distention. He was born at a gestational age of 40 weeks with a birth weight of 2800g and Apgar scores of 7/8, respectively. He had no history of formula feeding. Two weeks before admission to the hospital, the patient experienced frequent diarrhea with fever. He was found lethargic with abdominal distention, absence of bowel sounds, and abdominal tenderness. A plain abdominal x-ray and CT scan showed gastric and intestinal dilatation, and a gasless colon, suggesting a small bowel obstruction, and bowel wall thickening indicating peritonitis, without any free subdiaphragmatic air (pneumoperitoneum). Moreover, the patient did not have a congenital heart disease. While in intensive medical treatment, he showed a continuous clinical deterioration. All findings were suggestive of intestinal inflammation with clinical deterioration. We decided to perform an emergency exploratory laparotomy and found ischemia along the jejunoileal with a perforation at 25 cm above the ileocecal valve. Subsequently, we performed a double-barrel ileostomy through a separate incision from the laparotomy. Histopathological findings confirmed the diagnosis of NEC. We closed the stoma on postoperative day 43. The patient was discharged uneventfully following a month.

### Necrotizing enterocolitis: New insights into pathogenesis and mechanisms [^116XCaYf]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most frequent and lethal disease of the gastrointestinal tract in preterm infants. Currently, NEC is believed to develop in the premature host in the context of bacterial colonization, often after the administration of non-breast milk feeds. Disease onset is thought to partly result from a baseline increased reactivity of the premature intestinal mucosa to microbial ligands compared to the full-term intestinal mucosa. This increased reactivity results in mucosal destruction and impaired mesenteric perfusion and partly reflects an increased expression of the bacterial receptor, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), in the premature gut, along with other factors that predispose the intestine to a hyper-reactive state in response to colonizing microorganisms.

The increased expression of TLR4 in the premature gut reveals a surprising role for this molecule in regulating normal intestinal development through its effects on the Notch signaling pathway. This review examines the approach to the diagnosis and treatment of NEC, presents an overview of our knowledge regarding its molecular underpinnings, and highlights advances made in the past decade towards the development of specific preventive and treatment strategies for this devastating disease.

### Risk factors for necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates: A systematic review of prognostic studies [^111SG9H2]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe multifactorial disease in preterm neonates associated with high morbidity and mortality. Better insight into the prognostic values of the many reported factors associated with NEC is needed to enable the identification of neonates at risk for NEC. The aim was to systematically review the literature to identify independent risk factors for NEC.

- **Methods**: Medline, Cochrane, Embase, Pubmed, and Google Scholar were searched systematically for cohort studies reporting prognostic factors for NEC in neonates using multivariable analysis. Studies were scored with the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool (QUIPS).

- **Results**: From 5,154 initial hits, 14 prognostic studies were included with various designs. Study quality was rated high in three studies, and moderate or low in the 11 others. Significant prognostic factors for NEC reported in at least two studies were low birth weight, small for gestational age, low gestational age, assisted ventilation, premature rupture of membranes, black ethnicity, sepsis, outborn, and hypotension (all increased risk). Surfactant therapy showed conflicting results, and cesarean section was associated with a lower risk. Meta-analysis was considered not feasible.

- **Conclusion**: High-quality studies on prognostic factors for NEC are rare. Several prognostic factors, that are not necessarily causal, are associated with NEC. High-quality prognostic research is necessary to establish the predictive values of these factors.

### Current research on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and management of necrotizing enterocolitis [^111pdHML]. Neonatology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite decades of research on necrotizing enterocolitis, we still do not fully understand the pathogenesis of the disease or how to prevent or treat it. However, recent significant advances in the microbiology, molecular biology, and cell biology of the intestines of preterm infants and infants with necrotizing enterocolitis offer some hope. There is potential for this research to translate into effective prevention, more rapid diagnosis, and novel therapies for this devastating disease.

### Opportunities for the federal government to advance necrotizing enterocolitis research [^116sKAiZ]. Pediatric Research (2020). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the neonatal ICU, with minimal progress in the research.

- **Methods**: Federal webpages were queried to find funding opportunity announcements (FOAs) and to develop lists of funded projects on NEC, in order to identify gaps in NEC-related research topics.

- **Results**: Over the past 30 years, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued two FOAs to stimulate research on NEC, with $4.1 million set aside for the first year of respective funding. We identified 23 recently funded studies, of which 18 were research projects, 4 were training grants, and 1 was conference grant support. Only one grant focused on parent and family engagement in the NICU.

- **Conclusion**: There are significant research gaps that can be addressed with adequate funding from the federal government on the prevention and treatment of NEC.

### Bowel ultrasound for predicting surgical management of necrotizing enterocolitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115oniNK]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) represents a significant cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, especially in preterm infants. It is estimated that about 5% to 14% of infants weighing less than 1500 g at birth develop NEC, with about 25% to 40% dying because of it. NEC can rapidly progress to intestinal perforation, peritonitis, and shock, making timely diagnosis and treatment essential for improved outcomes. Diagnosis of NEC is based on clinical presentation, laboratory tests, and imaging. The role of imaging is crucial in confirming the diagnosis and following disease progression, but interpretation can be challenging as normal or nonspecific findings do not rule out NEC entirely. Initial treatment includes bowel rest, intravenous fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and other supportive measures. However, this can be ineffective in controlling disease progression in some infants, necessitating surgical intervention with either peritoneal drainage or bowel resection. The transition from medical to surgical care represents a critical decision-making point in NEC management that can have significant implications for clinical outcomes.

Traditionally, plain abdominal radiography is the imaging modality of choice for evaluating infants for NEC. However, abdominal radiographs are challenging to interpret due to wide variability and significant overlap between radiographic signs of NEC and other intestinal pathologies. Abdominal radiographs are also limited in characterizing disease progression; free air, which radiographs can detect reasonably well, is already a late finding.

### A systematic review of serologic tests in the diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis [^115ZEZAo]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Although many serologic markers have been suggested for the diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis, there is little consensus on which of these is potentially clinically useful. Our aims were to systematically review circulating markers that are potentially useful in the diagnosis of NEC and to compare the relative performance of each serologic marker of NEC by pooling estimates of marker accuracies and presenting their combined diagnostic accuracies.

- **Methods**: We undertook a systematic review of the literature to identify studies that reported serologic markers at the time of diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis. Where possible, we constructed 2-by-2 tables of diagnostic accuracy from each article. If two or more studies investigated the same test, their results were meta-analyzed by pooling estimates of sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio for a positive index test (LR+), likelihood ratio for a negative index test (LR-), diagnostic odds ratio, and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals.

- **Results**: Twenty-five articles provided information on serology at the time of diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis. Of these, it was possible to construct diagnostic accuracy tables from 16 articles and to combine data from studies that used C-reactive protein, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein, and platelet-activating factor. C-reactive protein was found to be a sensitive but nonspecific marker for necrotizing enterocolitis, whereas platelet-activating factor and intestinal fatty acid-binding protein were both sensitive and specific.

- **Conclusions**: Most serologic markers show potential for use in diagnosing necrotizing enterocolitis, but further research is needed to establish clear clinical guidelines.

### Probiotics for necrotizing enterocolitis: A systematic review [^111GVCKx]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most commonly acquired neonatal intraabdominal emergency and causes significant morbidity and mortality. A proposed strategy for the prevention of NEC is the administration of oral probiotics. Probiotics have been shown to reduce NEC in experimental rat models and have been used in clinical trials. The authors aimed to review the existing data on the use of oral probiotics for the prevention of NEC in preterm infants (age < 33 weeks) and those with very low birth weight (VLBW).

- **Materials and methods**: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs was performed to find outcome measures of incidence, severity, need for surgery, and mortality in NEC. Electronic searches were performed on Medline and CINAHL databases using keyword and subject headings with combinations of the terms "infant, preterm"; "infant, VLBW"; "enterocolitis, necrotizing"; and "probiotics". In addition, citation searches were performed for all potential studies.

- **Results**: Six potential RCTs were identified for inclusion, but there were no systematic or Cochrane database reviews identified. One study was discounted because of the use of historical controls, so five studies were selected for analysis. Cumulatively, 640 infants were treated with probiotics and 627 were used as control subjects. All of the studies showed a trend toward less NEC in the treatment group. The heterogeneity of probiotic formulations and the timing and methods of interventions in the identified studies made synthesis and comparison of data inappropriate.

### Necrotizing enterocolitis in term neonates: A different disease process [^115mA2Ms]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) has been a long-recognized complication of prematurity, but there is a paucity of studies on term infants. We sought to characterize the clinical presentation and outcomes of full-term (FT) infants with NEC and compare these to our experience with preterm (PT) neonates.

- **Methods**: We conducted a chart review of infants admitted to the NICU at the University of Michigan with a diagnosis of NEC over a 10-year period, with a Modified Bell stage of 2 or greater. We compared the outcomes and comorbidities of PT against those of FT, defined as gestational age at birth below and above 37 weeks, respectively.

- **Results**: Out of 170 infants, 28 (17%) were FT. FT neonates were more likely to have undergone cardiac surgery for a congenital defect, excluding PDA ligation (64% vs. 8%). When compared to FT infants, PT infants were more likely to require surgical intervention (18% vs. 59%), have Bell stage 3 disease (82% vs. 43%), require vasopressor support (21% vs. 42%), and require ventilatory support (43% vs. 75%). ✱ p < 0.01, + p < 0.05.

- **Conclusion**: FT neonates present with different patterns of disease and have different outcomes, suggesting that this may be a different clinical entity than NEC in preterm infants.

- **Type of study**: Retrospective review. Level of evidence: Level III.

### Global incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114rsRVS]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

The increase in the incidence of NEC over time, as found in our study using meta-regression, may be attributed to multiple factors. These include improvements in neonatal care and better survival of premature infants, as well as advancements in diagnosis and reporting. The rise in the incidence of NEC over time can also be linked to the lack of widespread prevention strategies.

Ahle et al. demonstrated a J-shaped distribution of incidence over time in Sweden. The incidence was 150 per 10,000 live births among VLBW infants in the late 80s, which increased to approximately 800 per 10,000 live births in VLBW infants — a multiple-fold increase in later decades. This increase may be related to variations in local health services. However, findings from the analysis of the NICHD database from the United States showed a different picture. They reviewed VLBW infants across three epochs: 1987–1988, 1993–1994, and 1999–2000, and demonstrated that the incidence of NEC did not change over time. The data presented in our analysis represents a broader time period and a set of more diverse healthcare settings.

Due to the paucity of data available from lower-income countries, the pooled estimate may have limited external validity and may not be fully generalizable to all global settings and populations.

Our findings, however, should be understood in light of some limitations that this study encountered. Only 12 out of 26 studies could be considered to be of higher quality, and this may be linked to the substantial heterogeneity that was observed.

### Probiotics: Role in pathophysiology and prevention in necrotizing enterocolitis [^114EvC7V]. Seminars in Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an inflammatory bowel disease largely affecting low birth weight, premature infants. Once acquired, NEC is accompanied by significant mortality and morbid sequelae. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of NEC continues to evolve, and the development of NEC is likely multifactorial with resultant bowel injury mediated through a final, common inflammatory pathway. The predisposition for NEC appears to involve the interplay between intestinal integrity and function, enteral feeding and bacterial colonization, and regulation of the gastrointestinal and systemic inflammatory response. Commensal organisms or probiotics have been shown to be crucial in the development and modulation of each of these factors within the intestinal epithelium. As a result, probiotic supplementation has been proposed as a promising new intervention for the prevention of NEC.

To understand the potential utility of probiotics in NEC, we will discuss the following aspects:

- **Components of gut defense**: Exploring the mechanisms involved in gut defense.

- **Role of the intestinal ecosystem in modulating immunity and inflammation**: Assessing the influence of the intestinal microbiome.

- **Bacterial colonization patterns in the preterm infant compared with patterns seen in the healthy, full-term infant**: Identifying differences in colonization that may impact NEC development.

- **Evidence for probiotic use in other populations and diseases**: Reviewing probiotic applications in various health contexts.

- **Evidence of probiotic use specific to the preterm infant and NEC**: Evaluating research specific to probiotic interventions in the NEC context.

### Defining necrotizing enterocolitis: Current difficulties and future opportunities [^116xKVA8]. Pediatric Research (2020). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized infants. First classified through Bell staging in 1978, numerous additional definitions of NEC have been proposed over the subsequent decades. In this review, we summarize eight definitions of NEC and explore the similarities and differences in clinical signs and radiographic features included within these definitions, as well as their limitations.

We emphasize the importance of a global consensus on defining NEC to improve NEC research and outcomes. This includes input from participants at an international NEC conference. Furthermore, we highlight the significant role of patient-families in helping to redefine NEC.

### Serum markers of necrotizing enterocolitis: A systematic review [^111odtF5]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to systematically review the diagnostic utility of serum biomarkers for the diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). We conducted an electronic and manual search of the available evidence, including studies reporting data on the diagnostic accuracy of serum biomarkers for the diagnosis of NEC, available until January 2016.

From the 1,296 articles retrieved, we selected 22 studies. Only S100 A8/A9 protein and apolipoprotein-CII showed high sensitivity (100% and 96.4%, respectively) and specificity (90% and 95%, respectively) in studies using Bell stage II NEC as the target condition. High sensitivity and specificity were also reported for interleukin-10 (100% and 90%), interleukin 1-receptor antagonist (100% and 91.7%), intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (100% and 91%), and ischemia-modified albumin (94.7% and 92%) when tested to predict the evolution from definite to advanced NEC. Given the uncertainty, limited data availability, and heterogeneous populations among the different studies, a meta-analysis could not be performed. Major concerns about applicability arose from the spectrum of patients enrolled and the inclusion of diseases different from Bell stage ≥ 2 NEC as target conditions.

In conclusion, we identified only a few markers with good diagnostic accuracy and found an overall low quality of the studies on serum NEC biomarkers. Consequently, data supporting their use are insufficient.

### Utilizing ultrasound in suspected necrotizing enterocolitis with equivocal radiographic findings [^116wkdn6]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an inflammatory enterocolitis common in premature infants that is diagnosed by an array of clinical and radiographic findings. The diagnosis is often challenging as there are few definitive tests or biomarkers. The presence or absence of pneumatosis is one of the most objective and reproducible findings in severe NEC. As a result, abdominal radiography (AXR) has long been considered the radiographic gold standard for confirming the diagnosis and determining the severity of NEC, as well as for following the progression of the disease. Classically, gas-forming bacteria invade the intestinal mucosa in patients with NEC and generate intramural gas to produce the findings of pneumatosis intestinalis and portal venous air on AXR. These findings are pathognomonic for NEC based on the Modified Bell's Staging Criteria, and if diagnosed early, can be medically managed with bowel rest and antibiotics. Early diagnosis and management of NEC can potentially prevent progression towards bowel perforation and avoid the need for surgical intervention. However, it is well known that the capability of AXR to identify pneumatosis, portal venous gas, or even intraperitoneal free air is limited.

AXR findings in neonates undergoing evaluation for NEC are often described as non-diagnostic or equivocal, even by our most experienced pediatric radiologists. In many instances, it is difficult to differentiate between pneumatosis and intraluminal stool using AXR, often leading to a significant diagnostic dilemma. Lack of a definitive diagnosis may result in significant challenges for clinical management.

### Advances in our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis [^115SzXn5]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a multifactorial and complex disease. Our knowledge of the cellular and genetic basis of NEC has expanded considerably as new molecular mechanisms have been identified. This article will focus on the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of NEC, with a concentration on the inflammatory, immune, infectious, and genetic mechanisms that drive disease development.

### Understanding the susceptibility of the premature infant to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) [^111HpLmd]. Pediatric Research (2008). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common life-threatening gastrointestinal emergency encountered in the neonatal intensive care unit. Despite advances in neonatal care, NEC remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among premature infants. Epidemiologic studies have identified multiple factors that increase an infant's risk for developing NEC, although premature birth, bacterial colonization, and enteral feeding are thought to play central roles in disease pathogenesis.

Appreciating the factors that underlie the susceptibility of prematurely born infants to NEC is important for developing new strategies aimed at the prevention and treatment of the disease. In this review, we discuss defense mechanisms in the intestine and how these systems may be insufficient in the prematurely born infant, thereby further contributing to the initiation of NEC.

In addition, based on a review of the literature, we suggest that although numerous bacterial and viral pathogens have been associated with NEC, no individual organism is known to be responsible for the disease. Finally, we comment on the possible role of probiotics in promoting the maturation of intestinal defense mechanisms, thereby attenuating or preventing the sequence of events that lead to NEC.

### The role of imaging in the management of necrotising enterocolitis: A multispecialist survey and a review of the literature [^115xvMeF]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Differences between specialties must be interpreted with care, since practices may vary between hospitals within the same region, even where supplementary analyses did not reveal any substantial regional influence. Most respondents did not work at the same hospital, and perspectives on the differential diagnosis varying according to the field of expertise could be expected. How the time consumption of ultrasound is perceived may depend on whether it is compared to other clinical bedside examinations or to obtaining an AR.

Clinicians evaluating radiographic images or performing ultrasound do not eliminate the need for radiological expertise, but might contribute to a deeper understanding of the results and facilitate the close interaction between involved specialists, called for by some respondents. Radiologists need to get clinically involved, be aware of the consequences of reported signs, and discuss their implications with clinicians. Understanding the influence of the pathophysiological dynamic of NEC and its variation with gestational age on radiographic and ultrasonographic findings is important to tailor imaging according to the needs of the individual patient. The choice of modality as well as the examination schedule should ideally be decided by consent. US and Doppler may, however, confidently be recommended, at least for the evaluation of the need for surgery.

Together with the clinical picture, imaging is an indispensable tool in the management of NEC for detecting complications where the diagnosis is already established and solving the diagnostic puzzle where it is not.

### Evidence vs experience in neonatal practices in necrotizing enterocolitis [^113aPLra]. Journal of Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) has been recognized for over 40 years as a cause of inflammation and necrosis of the small and large intestine in infants born at less than 36 weeks of gestation. NEC remains a significant health problem for infants born prematurely and may become the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among these infants worldwide. The sequence of events leading to NEC is complex and multifactorial, although damage to the intestinal epithelium and invasion by bacteria are known to play central roles in disease pathogenesis.

- **Study design**: Bacteria initiate a cascade of inflammation that may progress to intestinal necrosis and perforation with sepsis and death.

- **Result**: Treatment of infants at risk for NEC with probiotic bacteria may be an area of great potential, as probiotic bacteria may promote maturation of the epithelial barrier and function to exclude bacterial pathogens from critical niches in the intestine, thereby disrupting a primary pathway in disease pathogenesis.

- **Conclusion**: Understanding how probiotic bacteria, or other novel therapies, prevent or limit disease propagation in NEC will be paramount in limiting the impact of disease in a growing population of premature newborns.

### Advances in our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis [^112ny7CH]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Understanding the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis involves a multifactorial molecular framework, which continues to be expanded through the study of its mechanisms in animal and cellular models. Emphasis is placed on factors that are a consequence of the immature immune system of the affected premature neonate, leading to an impaired gut barrier that is more susceptible to infection. The immune response and signaling that ensue after bacterial infection are dysregulated, resulting in overwhelming inflammation that manifests in the intestinal injury seen in NEC.

Apart from factors inherent to the immature immune system characteristic of the premature neonate, certain epigenetic modifications and regulatory elements have been identified that may further increase susceptibility to NEC. Finally, underdeveloped microvasculature and its underlying molecular regulators are implicated in the development of NEC. Further investigation into the described molecular signaling pathways and newly identified pathogenic mechanisms continues to characterize NEC and add to its complexity. It is expected that a better understanding of the molecular basis for the disease will translate into the development of potentially life-saving and preventative therapy.

### Necrotizing enterocolitis and the placenta - a key etiological link [^11131U17]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common and severe acquired acute neonatal surgical condition, associated with premature neonates. Antenatal factors, such as vascular insufficiency and antenatal infections, may be important in "priming" the inflammatory cascade, thus predisposing infants to the disease. This study explores the role of placental pathology in contributing to NEC pathogenesis.

- **Methods**: 5338 placentas from high-risk pregnancies were evaluated for placental insufficiency, infarction, and evidence of antenatal infection. Placentas of 72 premature infants developing surgical NEC (2007–2011) were identified and pathological placental features were compared with those of unaffected infants.

- **Results**: Pathologic evaluation was available for placentas of 72 out of 134 infants with surgically treated NEC (> grade 2 Bells). These placentas showed significantly more evidence of vascular pathology, such as placental infarcts, compared to high-risk cases [n = 38 (54.5%) versus n = 1122 (21%); P < 0.01]. Evidence of placental infection, chorioamnionitis, or villitis, along with evidence of a fetal inflammatory response, was present in surgical NEC infants compared to unaffected infants [n = 22 (31.8%) versus n = 647 (12%); P < 0.01], suggesting a possible pathogenic role.

- **Conclusion**: This study suggests that exposure to antenatal placental infection may contribute to the pathogenesis of NEC by modifying the fetal vascular response, warranting further study.

### European reference network for inherited and congenital anomalies evidence-based guideline on surgical aspects of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature neonates [^1146hy3M]. Neonatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for preterm infants, specifically in the management of necrotizing enterocolitis, the ERN ERNICA 2025 guidelines recommend recognizing that extremely low birth weight and/or the need for surgical intervention are factors that further increase the risk for neurodevelopmental disability and impaired quality of life (QoL). These factors should be taken into account when providing information on neurodevelopmental prognosis.
