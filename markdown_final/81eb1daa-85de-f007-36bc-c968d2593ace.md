## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many integer-coordinate points lie on the circumference of a circle centered at (199, 0) with radius 199. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the circle equation and what it implies for integer solutions. Then, I should verify whether the center's coordinates and the radius share common factors that would constrain the solutions. Next, I will enumerate the candidate integer points by exploiting symmetry and checking for additional solutions. Finally, I will confirm the count and reconcile it with the provided options.

> Let me first write the circle equation and simplify it for integer solutions. The standard form is (x − 199)² + y² = 199², and for integer points (x, y) this becomes (x − 199)² + y² = 199². I should confirm that 199 is prime because that will matter for the number of solutions; yes, 199 is a prime number, which will limit the factorizations that can yield integer pairs.

> Now, I will examine the trivial solutions that are easy to spot. If y = 0, then (x − 199)² = 199² implies x − 199 = ± 199, so x = 398 or x = 0, giving the two points (398, 0) and (0, 0). Wait, let me verify the second point: (0 − 199)² + 0² = 199², which checks out, so those two are valid.

> Next, I should consider whether there are solutions with x = 199. If x = 199, the equation reduces to y² = 199², so y = ± 199, yielding (199, 199) and (199, −199). Hold on, I should verify: (199 − 199)² + (± 199)² = 0 + 199² = 199², which is correct, so those are two more integer points.

> I will now examine whether any other integer solutions exist. For any other integer x, (x − 199)² must be a perfect square less than 199², and 199² − (x − 199)² must also be a perfect square. But wait, because 199 is prime, the only way to write 199² as a sum of two squares is with one square zero and the other 199², or with both squares zero, which we've already covered. This means there are no additional integer solutions beyond the four already identified. Let me double-check that reasoning: the sum-of-two-squares theorem implies that for a prime p ≡ 3 mod 4, the only representation of p² as a sum of two squares is p² + 0², and 199 ≡ 3 mod 4, so no other representations exist, confirming that no extra integer points lie on the circle.

> Putting this together, I have exactly four integer points: (398, 0), (0, 0), (199, 199), and (199, −199). Therefore, the correct answer is B. 4. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if symmetry might give us eight points, but that would be a mistake; the symmetry here produces only four distinct integer-coordinate positions on the circle, not eight, so I should stick with four.

The number of integer points on the circumference of the circle centered at (199, 0) with radius 199 is **4**. These points are (0, 0), (398, 0), (199, 199), and (199, -199). This result follows because the circle equation ((x - 199)^2 + y^2 = 199^2) has integer solutions only when either (y = 0) (giving (x = 0) or (x = 398)) or (x = 199) (giving (y = \\pm 199)). No other integer solutions exist, so the answer is **B. 4**.

## Circle equation and integer solutions

The standard equation of a circle with center ((h, k)) and radius (r) is:

[
(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2
]

For this problem, the center is ((199, 0)) and the radius is 199, so the equation becomes:

[
(x - 199)^2 + y^2 = 199^2
]

We need to find all integer pairs ((x, y)) that satisfy this equation.

---

## Analyzing integer solutions

### Case 1: y = 0

When (y = 0), the equation simplifies to:

[
(x - 199)^2 = 199^2
]

Taking square roots:

[
x - 199 = \\pm 199
]

Thus:

[
x = 199 + 199 = 398 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = 199–199 = 0
]

This gives two integer points: ((398, 0)) and ((0, 0)).

---

### Case 2: x = 199

When (x = 199), the equation simplifies to:

[
y^2 = 199^2
]

Taking square roots:

[
y = \\pm 199
]

This gives two more integer points: ((199, 199)) and ((199, -199)).

---

### Case 3: x ≠ 199 and y ≠ 0

For (x \\neq 199) and (y \\neq 0), we need ((x - 199)^2 + y^2 = 199^2) with both ((x - 199)^2) and (y^2) positive perfect squares. Let (a = x - 199); then (a^2 + y^2 = 199^2). Since 199 is prime, the only way to express (199^2) as a sum of two squares is (199^2 + 0^2) or (0^2 + 199^2), which correspond to the cases already found. Therefore, there are **no additional integer solutions** in this case.

---

## Summary of integer points

The integer points on the circumference are:

| **X-coordinate** | **Y-coordinate** |
|-|-|
| 0 | 0 |
| 398 | 0 |
| 199 | 199 |
| 199 | -199 |

---

Thus, there are **exactly 4 integer points** on the circumference.

---

## Conclusion

The number of integer points on the circumference of the circle centered at (199, 0) with radius 199 is **4**. The correct answer is **B. 4**.

### Toroidal topology of population activity in grid cells [^55d3e20a]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

To verify that the lifetimes of prominent bars in the barcodes were beyond chance, shuffled distributions were generated for the persistence lifetimes in each dimension. In each shuffling, the spike train of each cell was shifted independently in time by rolling the firing rate arrays a random length between 0 and the length of the session. The same preprocessing and persistence analysis were then performed on the shifted spike trains as for the unshuffled data. This was performed 1,000 times, and each time a barcode was obtained. The barcodes were concatenated for all shuffles and the maximum lifetime was found for each dimension. This lifetime served as a significance criterion for the bar lifetimes. It is noted, however, that this is a heuristic and that statistics of barcodes are still not well established.

Cohomological decoding

As there are other spaces with similar barcodes as for a torus, the results identified by the barcode were further investigated, using the ‘cohomological decoding’ procedure introduced previouslyto calculate a toroidal parametrization of the point clouds of population activity. This assigns to each point corresponding positions on each of the two circular features identified by the 1D bars with the longest lifetime, resulting in coordinates that further characterize the underlying shape of the data.

Cohomological decoding is motivated by the observation that the 1D cohomology (with integer coefficients) of a topological space X is equivalent to the set of homotopy-equivalent classes of continuous maps from X to the circle (S 1); that is:

This subsequently means that for each 1D bar existing at a given radius, there exists a corresponding continuous map from the Vietoris-Rips complex of that radius to the circle. Thus, we may first use persistent cohomology to detect which elements represent meaningful (long-lived) features of the data and choose a radius for which these features exist. As the vertices of the Vietoris-Rips complex are points in the point cloud, the circular values of the corresponding maps at the vertices describe circular coordinates of the data.

### Multifocal imaging for precise, label-free tracking of fast biological processes in 3D [^b2b1b157]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

For a circle of radius R centered at r c = (x c, y c), the circle equationcan be rewritten as, where. With the coordinates of the pixel given, we can fit the transformed circle equation linearly to calculate the parameters x c, y c, and b. The linear fit is constructed into the matrix formwhere,,, andis the weight matrix defined by the square of the pixel intensity.is the approximate solution of this overdetermined equation, which can be calculated with the least-squares principle. Finally, the circle radius R can be determined using the equation:

If the quality of the fit r 2 > 0.8, the radius was used to infer the z -position. If the fit to the radial profile did not match the criterion in more than two planes, the bead was excluded from analysis, and no z -position was determined. The z -position was determined for each remaining bead as follows. In each focal plane, a difference function of the determined bead radius and the plane’s calibrated relationship between bead radius and z -position was determined. Each difference function shows two minima, which represent the two most probable z -positions (one located above and another below the focal plane). Finally, the position of the bead was unequivocally determined from the multiple measures of the z -positions across different planes: the combination of z -positions from the different planes with the lowest standard deviation was selected. For each z -position, the precision was predicted based on the calibrated relationship of z -position and fit width. The z -position with lowest precision value was selected as the final bead’s z -position.

Images of immobilized beads at different heights set by a piezo-driven objective were used for calibration of z -positions. Radius profiles across z of seven different beads were aligned by minimizing the least-mean-square between all the planes. Finally, aligned profiles were averaged and smoothed. This resulted in a radius function R (z). To estimate the precision error σ z resulting from inferring the z -position of beads using this function, we used error propagation of the inverse function:, where σ R is the standard deviation of the calibration for different beads.

Individual bead coordinates on each frame were connected to form tracks using custom-made software written in MATLAB. The software searched for the nearest particle across frames within a distance of less than 1.5 µm.

### Grid-like entorhinal representation of an abstract value space during prospective decision making [^95f59434]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In each block, the order of trajectories was randomized according to the direction.

In each block, trajectories were positioned within the circle created by a radius of 50 from the central point of the two-dimensional value space (coordinates: x = 50, y = 50). Equal positioning of trajectories in the relevant circular area of the space was achieved by a genetic algorithm. Its goal was to position trajectories so as to minimize the standard deviation of the number of time points (locations on trajectories) falling into the 10 × 10 sub-squares of the relevant circular area (for 2000 generations).

Each block lasted approx. 13 min (M = 12.74 min, SD = 0.15 min). It started with a fixation cross presented at the center of the screen for 10 s before the first trial. After the last trial, a fixation cross was presented at the center of the screen for 15 s, followed by a message informing the experimenter that the block finished and the MRI run could be stopped. After each block, participants received feedback about their performance in the given block. The feedback stated the number of correctly answered trials as well as the earned monetary bonus in the given block. More specifically, in each block a trial was randomly chosen for the bonus. If the answer in this trial was correct, the highest values across the entire trial were summed up and converted into a bonus (so that a value of 50 yielded 0.20 €). If the answer in this trial was false, no bonus was won. Participants were instructed about this bonus beforehand. Participants could take a short break before the next block.

### Machine learning meets complex networks via coalescent embedding in the hyperbolic space [^4aa17e63]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Physicists recently observed that realistic complex networks emerge as discrete samples from a continuous hyperbolic geometry enclosed in a circle: the radius represents the node centrality and the angular displacement between two nodes resembles their topological proximity. The hyperbolic circle aims to become a universal space of representation and analysis of many real networks. Yet, inferring the angular coordinates to map a real network back to its latent geometry remains a challenging inverse problem. Here, we show that intelligent machines for unsupervised recognition and visualization of similarities in big data can also infer the network angular coordinates of the hyperbolic model according to a geometrical organization that we term "angular coalescence." Based on this phenomenon, we propose a class of algorithms that offers fast and accurate "coalescent embedding" in the hyperbolic circle even for large networks. This computational solution to an inverse problem in physics of complex systems favors the application of network latent geometry techniques in disciplines dealing with big network data analysis including biology, medicine, and social science.

### Morphology of travel routes and the organization of cities [^22ed6869]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Methods

Sampling routing pairs

For each of our 92 cities, a city center is defined by referencing the coordinates fromand the travel routes are sampled according to a choice of OD pairs relative to the center and measured in spherical coordinates (distance from center r, and angular separation relative to center θ). To avoid any sample bias, and to systematically investigate the dependence of route morphology on distance from the urban center, we only consider OD pairs at a fixed radius r.

Furthermore, at each r we section the circumference of the circle at intervals of 10° for a total of 36 points (with the minimal angular separation chosen to avoid effects of noise). We then vary the radius over the range 2, 5, 10, 20, and finally 30 km (roughly corresponding to a city boundary) and enumerate over all OD pairs by connecting the 36 points at a given radius r for a total oftotal OD pairs.

Finally, we query the OpenStreetMap API for the suggested travel routes connecting each of the pairs. In fact, for a better characterization of the functional features of the systems (e.g. road capacities) and the role of their hierarchical organizations, we obtained two different kinds of routes between all these pairs: the shortest, based on lengths of road segments, and the fastest that accounts for both the length and the travel time based on flow capacity of the roads (i.e. speed limits, number of lanes, etc.). A visual representation of our methodology in segmenting the city is shown in Fig. 2a and typical examples of the shortest and fastest route for a given city is shown in Fig. 2b. (For more details on our data samples, see Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.)

Calculation of inness

The inness I is calculated by summing over the areas of the number of polygons in the route by using the shoelace formula, thusHere n is the number of vertices of the polygon, m is the total number of polygons in the route, (x i, j, y i, j) corresponds to the coordinate of j ’th vertex of polygon i, and sgn(i) accounts for our adopted convention for inner and outer points.

Data availability

All data needed to evaluate the conclusions are present in the paper and/or the Supplementary Materials. Additional data related to this paper may be requested from the authors and are also available at.

### Integrating AI-powered digital pathology and imaging mass cytometry identifies key classifiers of tumor cells, stroma, and immune cells in non-small cell lung cancer [^93e47e2f]. Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The AI-tool allowed us to obtain spatial coordinates for every cell. We then aimed at extracting additional tumor features by quantifying the spatial localization of tumor cells with the K function summary statistic (Fig. 2A ; ref.). Briefly, the K function describes the spatial distribution of a group of points (corresponding, in our case, to the centroid of each tumor cell) as a function of their distance (Fig. 2B). The resulting K function score (resulting from the distribution of the peak values of the normalized and centered K function curves; ref.) expresses how clustered a set of points (or cells) is when compared with a reference set of points with a random distribution (theoretical curve; Fig. 2B and C). Each sample was classified according to the K score, as “uniformly distributed” (Fig. 2A, left, gray circle), “poorly clustered” (Fig. 2A, middle, blue circle) or “highly clustered” (Fig. 2A, right, magenta circle). Another interesting metric related to the tumor cell distribution is the cluster's radius, resulting from the distribution of the radius values corresponding to the peak of the K curves and divided by 1.3, expressing the mean size of the cluster (Fig. 2C). Deployment of the K function calculation to the TMA spots revealed that the cell distribution pattern was highly heterogeneous, with only one adenocarcinoma and one SCC classified as uniformly distributed in the tissue, and the other spots classified as clustered (Fig. 2D, left). The range of K score for these spots was quite large, stretching from 4.80 to 325.81 (Fig. 2D, left), as indication of the heterogeneous distribution of tumor cells in the cohort analyzed. As to the cluster's radius, the population was classified as “small radius” or “large radius” (Fig. 2D, right). The two metrics moderately correlated (n = 116, r = 0.2292, P = 0.0133 by Pearson correlation analysis; Fig. 2E). Notably, among SCCs, there was the highest frequency of highly clustered samples (P < 0.001 by chi square; Fig. 2F).

### A topological fluctuation theorem [^0a82bf95]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Let us now consider trajectories for which the initial and final points share the same radial and axial coordinates: Δ r = Δ z = 0, while the total winding angle Δ ϕ remains arbitrary. In case I where the potential is isotropic (α = 1) and its ground state coincides with the vortex core (x c = 0), Δ U is independent of the winding angle Δ ϕ such that the probability ratio ϑ averaged over trajectory time and initial positions follows the predicted exponential scaling for all winding angles (see orange line in Fig. 2 f). In general, however, Γ is affected by the symmetries of the trap such that ϑ does not decay exponentially with the winding angle Δ ϕ. Setting α ≠ 1 (case II, Fig. 2 d), Δ U depends explicitly on Δ ϕ and vanishes only for Δ ϕ = n π. Consequently, the averaged winding angle probability ratio departs from the exponential scaling for all Δ ϕ not multiple of π (see red line in Fig. 2 f). Moreover, in the third case of an isotropic harmonic potential, but whose minimum is shifted of x c ≠ 0 (Fig. 2 e), the winding angle probability ratio shows similar oscillations as in case II, except that due to the lack of reflection symmetry of U those are 2 π -periodic (blue line in Fig. 2 f). In all cases, thanks to the topological protection offered by closed loops the data shown in Fig. 2 f systematically falls on the predicted exponential curve for Δ ϕ integer factor of 2 π.

The multi-vortex case

To simplify the following analysis and allow for the study of fixed time trajectories, we now consider the case where the potential U (r) acts as a stiff wall confining the particles inside a cylinder of radius R and such that U = 0 inside of the cylinder. For such confinement and a single vortex line located at r = 0, we find that for t ≪ R 2 / D the distribution p (ϕ, t) exhibits exponential tails, while for t ≫ R 2 / D the effect of confining boundaries leads to p (ϕ, t) being Gaussian (see Fig 2 c). As expected from Eq. (13), in this case one can set Δ U = 0 and the fluctuation theorem is found to hold at winding angles for all observation times, independently of the particular shape of the distribution.

Even for small field changes of 2 µT corresponding to size changes of 5–8% in region depicted by (b – e), the skyrmion distribution varies drastically and skyrmions are pinned at different positions indicating size-dependent pinning sites. In (d), predominant pinning sites are highlighted by the dashed purple circles and labelled with integers 1–4.

### Freely orbiting magnetic tweezers to directly monitor changes in the twist of nucleic acids [^ba50e6d3]. Nature Communications (2011). Medium credibility.

Results

Forces and torques in MTs

At the heart of FOMT are superparamagnetic beads tethered to a flow cell surface via double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) tethers (Fig. 1a). We use a cylindrical magnet mounted on a motor-controlled vertical linear stage above the surface to apply upward forces to the magnetic beads that stretch the DNA tether. The force exerted on the magnetic beads by the external magnetic field B depends on their total magnetization m(B) and is proportional to the gradient of the magnetic field. In contrast, the torque applied to the beads by the magnetic field depends on the preferred magnetization axis, m 0, and is given by: Γ B =m 0 × B. If B is aligned vertically as in FOMT, m 0 aligns vertically and the torque from the magnet about the z axis, equal to m 0,x B y (or m 0,y B x), is negligible. In contrast, the magnetic fields in conventional MT and MTT have large enough horizontal components to constrain the beads' rotation about the z axis, as a result of which the beads will faithfully follow rotation of the permanent magnets.

Bead fluctuations in the FOMT lie on a circular annulus

The excursions in (x,y) of a magnetic bead tethered by a single dsDNA tether depend strongly on the position of the tether with respect to the axis of the cylindrical magnet (Fig. 1 ; Supplementary Figs S2–S3). When the magnet is far from being centered on the tethered bead, the fluctuations in x and y are uncoupled and Gaussian distributed, similar to the fluctuations observed in conventional MTs (Supplementary Figs S2–S4). As the cylindrical magnet is progressively centered on the magnetic bead, the (x,y) fluctuations become coupled and trace out circular arcs. If the cylindrical magnet is centered on the bead to within ∼10 μm, the torque from the magnets about the z axis is reduced to the point that thermal fluctuations suffice to rotate the bead around its attachment point. Consequently, the fluctuations in (x,y) are strongly coupled and trace out a circular annulus with radius R circle, where R circle is the radial distance between the DNA attachment point and the bead's centre (Fig. 1b,c).

### Pre-processing visualization of hyperspectral fluorescent data with spectrally encoded enhanced representations [^9ed3665f]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Furthermore, given a point N ′ on the circumference centered in O ′, Eq. (14) also implies that:which is equivalent towhere R is the radius of the phasor plot unit circle.

With this approach, provided a new center A ⊥ ′ with a specific α, we obtain a collection of scaled circles with centers on line OA ⊥ ′. In boundary cases, when α = 0, the scaled circle is the origin, while α = 1 is the unit circle. Given any cutting plane O ′, the radius of this cross section always satisfies this identity:

The coordinates of a point P ′′(g o, s o) for a new morphed map centered in A ⊥ ′ are:

Finally, we computeand then assign colors based on the newly calculated hue, saturation, and value to generate the morph mode references.

Color image quality calculations: colorfulness

Due to the inherent lack of ground truth in experimental fluorescence microscopy images, we utilized an established model for calculating the color quality of an image without a reference. The colorfulness is one of three parameters, together with sharpness and contrast, utilized by Panetta et al.to quantify the overall quality of a color image. Two opponent color spaces are defined as:where R, G, and B are the red, green, and blue channels, respectively, α and β are red-green and yellow-blue spaces. The colorfulness utilized here is defined as:

With,, μ α, μ β, respectively, as the variances and mean values of the α and β spaces.

Sharpness

We utilize EME, a Weber based measure of enhancement. EME is defined as follows:Where k 1, k 2 are the blocks used to divide the image and I max, k, l and I min, k, l are the maximum and minimum intensities in the blocks. EME has been shown to correlate with a human observation of sharpness in color imageswhen associated with a weight λ c for each color component.Where the weights for different color components used in this article are λ R = 0.299, λ G = 0.587, λ B = 0.114 in accordance with NTSC standard and values reported in literature.

### The use of cylindrical coordinates for treatment planning parameters of an elongated 192Ir source [^e2ca0096]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

The doses given to the intima, media, and adventitia are very crucial quantities in intravascular brachytherapy. To facilitate accurate computerized treatment planning calculations, we have determined dose distributions in away-and-along table format around an 192Ir wire source and developed pertinent dosimetric parameters in cylindrical coordinates.

Methods and Materials

The Monte Carlo method (MCNP4C code) was used to calculate the dose distributions for the AngioRad 192Ir wire source (model SL-77HS, Interventional Therapies). The calculations were carried out for photon, beta, and electron (conversion and Auger) contributions for radial distances from 0.03 to 2.0 cm with 0.01-cm increments, and up to 2.24 cm from the source center in the longitudinal direction with 0.04-cm resolution. Dose rate values are determined in away-and-along format (cylindrical coordinates) and then converted to spherical coordinate format. Dosimetric parameters, such as the geometry factor, G(r, theta), and anisotropy function, F(r, theta), are generated in both cylindrical (R, Z, phi) and spherical (r, theta, phi) coordinates. The use of a cylindrical coordinate system for treatment planning parameters is proposed as a more suitable approach for accurate calculations.

Results

The photon contribution to dose varies nearly inversely with radial distance (from the source center) along the perpendicular bisector with 0.199 x 10(-3) cGy U(-1) s(-1) (0.802 cGy Ci(-1) s(-1)) at 1 cm. The beta and electron contributions start at very high values of about 35.5 x 10(-3) cGy U(-1) s(-1) and 11.0 x 10(-3) cGy U(-1) s(-1), respectively, at 0.03 cm and fall off exponentially to negligible amount near 0.2 cm. The total dose rate at 0.2 cm is 1.428 x 10(-3) cGy U(-1) s(-1) (5.754 cGy Ci(-1) s(-1)). The radial dose function, g(R), is nearly unity between 0.2 cm and 2 cm. Due to the beta and electron dose contributions, g(R) increases steeply to 5.5 as radial distance decreases from 0.2 cm down to 0.03 cm. The F(R, Z) values are close to unity for the majority of the region of interest. In contrast, F(r, theta) experiences a steep rise as shallow angles are approached (closer to the source), related to the beta dose contributions. Accurate treatment planning calculations would be possible with linear interpolation of F(R, Z), but difficult with F(r, theta) in the spherical coordinate system and the original normalization point as recommended in the American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group 60 (AAPM TG-60) formalism.

Conclusion

The AngioRad 192Ir wire source, model SL-77HS, was completely characterized dosimetrically using Monte Carlo methods. The use of cylindrical coordinates and a modified anisotropy function normalization point for dosimetric parameters of an elongated 192Ir source is more suitable for accurate computerized treatment planning calculations in intravascular brachytherapy.

### STREAMING-tag system reveals spatiotemporal relationships between transcriptional regulatory factors and transcriptional activity [^2719c5f5]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Image analysis of SNAPtag cluster, MCP, and mTetR spots was performed as described by Li et al. 2020. First, a 19 × 19-pixel region of interest centered on the mTetR spot was selected. The coordinates of mTetR and MCP spots were determined by local maxima using trackpy.locate in the Trackpy package (version 0.5.0). The spots were then subjected to Gauss fitting using trackpy.refine_leastsq to determine the coordinates at the subpixel level. Most signals in a single spot were covered in 6-pixel diameter circle (see Figs. 6 b and 7a). Therefore, in this study, the mean intensities within a circle with a radius of 6 pixels from the spot center were calculated using Trackpy and were used as spot intensity values. MCP spots within 390 nm of the mTetR spot with a mean fluorescence intensity greater than two-fold to the mean intensity of the 19 × 19-pixel region of interest were classified as the “ON” state, and the remaining spots were classified as “OFF”. SNAPtag clusters were identified by local maxima using trackpy.locate. In addition, the cluster centers were determined at the sub-pixel level by Gauss fitting using trackpy.refine_leastsq. The 2D distances between the nearest SNAP and mTetR coordinates were calculated in each cell.

To produce a RF cluster averaged image, 19 × 19 pixel images centered on the RF cluster coordinate that was closest to the mTetR spot were extracted and averaged. To measure the diameter (full width at half maximum peak height: FWHM) of RF clusters, the averaged images were processed using ImagJ plug-in GaussFit OnSpot with shape=Circle, fitmode = [Levenberg Marquard] parameter.

Statistics and reproducibility

The exact number, n, of data points and their representation (such as cells and independent experiments), and statistical tests used are indicated in the respective figure legends and in the results. All experiments were performed as two or more independent experiments. The same conclusions were obtained from each experiment. Statistical tests were performed in R software (The R Project for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and Python (Python Software Foundation,). Boxplots with descriptive statistics were created in R software and Python. Boxes indicate the interquartile range (IQR; 25–75% intervals) and median line; whiskers indicate 1.5-fold of the IQR.

In contrast, if we demandit followsand we obtainwithand. This differential equation can be solved by separation of variables (see Appendix B), yielding the function k (K). Yet, the inverse function, K (k), describes the distribution of the circle radii to achieve a Hamming filter, and is thus required. Although the resulting functioncannot be solved analytically, an inverse series expansion can be performed up to an arbitrary order. For this work, the function K (k) was approximated up to the 70th order. Evaluating K for discrete k i,, N min number of circles determined by the Nyquist criterion, gives the radii distributionto achieve a Hamming density, see Figure 1. The number of circles needed to achieve theand the Hamming weighting are displayed in Table 1 for various matrix sizes.

The density simulations (blue, 3rd column) have been performed by gridding of ones without density compensation and an overgridding factor of 1. They match the analytical solutions (red), except of the peaks in the k‐space center which result from imperfections of the gridding algorithm. However they can be taken care of via the pre and post gridding density compensation. We observed a maximum number of three points deviating stronger from the expected densities in the center. For DW‐CONCEPT very minor deviations of the density along the outer most circle (radius k max) were observed due to the Taylor approximation of K.

### Dimension-agnostic and granularity-based spatially variable gene identification using BSP [^7b9ac05c]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

3D simulation on FISH data with discrete spatial patterns

To further evaluate the model’s performance on data with locally influential discrete patterns (Fig. 4D), we designed a set of 3D simulation scenarios within the ranges of x- and y- coordinates from 0 to 30. The local discrete spatial patterns were constructed using solid spheres with a center-to-center distance of 8 units. Specifically, sixteen center points were selected, with fixed z-coordinates of 5.5, and the x- and y-coordinates were generated from a sequence of numbers from 3 to 27 with an interval of 8. To introduce randomness into spatial patterns, we incorporated a uniformly distributed random variable ranging from −2 to 2 and added it to the coordinates of each center point. The cells within the spheres were marked, and expression values were assigned as Section 4.3.1.

In these simulations, SVGs were generated using the Irregular lump pattern described in Section 4.3.1. We created 500 SVGs with locally influential discrete patterns and an additional 500 SVGs with globally influential continuous patterns, along with 9000 non-SVGs as permutated genes without any spatial pattern. We considered three scenarios to compare the effects of pattern sizes, signal strengths, and noise levels, respectively. We adjusted radius values from 1.5 to 2.0 (small and moderate), expected expression fold changes from 2 to 2.5 (small and moderate), and noise levels from 2.0 to 3.0 (moderate and high). To ensure robustness, ten replicates were generated to perform the power analysis.

### Imaging quantized vortex rings in superfluid helium to evaluate quantum dissipation [^281f11c8]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Positions and radiuses of trapped particles

To evaluate the effects of the trapped D 2 particles on the motion of a vortex ring, we need to know the radius and initial position of each individual trapped particle. Using the feature-point tracking routine, we can determine the coordinates of every particles in the x - z image plane. For particles trapped on the vortex ring, their coordinates (x i, z i) should satisfy the following equation of an ellipse:where (x 0, z 0) are the coordinates of the ellipse center, R 1 and R 2 are, respectively, the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse, and ϕ is the angle between the ellipse major axis and the x -axis. These five parameters can be uniquely determined through a least squares fit to the positions of the trapped particles when there are at least five particles on the ring. Through this fit, we can determine the vortex ring radius R = R 1 and the projection angle θ between the ring’s normal vectorand the x - z plane (i.e.). If we set y 0 = 0 for the ellipse center at t = 0, the initial y i of each trapped particle can be calculated as. In the Supplementary Table 1, we list the 3D coordinates of all the nine trapped particles for the vortex ring presented in Fig. 1. The coordinate uncertainty comes from the feature-point tracking fit of the particle’s image profile. These coordinates are used in our model simulations.

### AI-enabled screening for retinopathy of prematurity in low-resource settings [^d3a90958]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Fundus Image Selection

In the first phase, our machine learning algorithm sought to identify the highest-quality retinal images from the smartphone-captured, magnifying glass–enhanced video of the retina. All video frames were extracted from the raw mobile videos at a specific sampling rate of 5 frames, and the individual color video frames were converted to grayscale. Since the magnifiers used for video collection are circular, we used the circular Hough transformation processto conduct a search of all circles within a frame in a learned radius range. The Hough transformation can be used to determine the parameters of a circle when several points that fall on the perimeter are known, as follows. A circle with radius R and center (a, b) can be described with the parametric equations x = a + R cos(θ) and y = b + R sin(θ). When angle θ sweeps through a 360-degree range, the points x and y trace the perimeter of a circle. The radius is calculated based on the magnifier size, and the search identifies the true center point of the circle. If no circles with the expected dimensions are found, the frame is disregarded. If multiple circles are detected, the one with parameters that are closest to the expected magnifier dimensions is selected. Using the center coordinate parameters and the radius, the fundus images were cropped from the original color video frame and resized to a fixed 256 ×  256 pixel size.

To ensure that only retinal images were collected, we trained an image classifier that used a residual networkarchitecture. The output of this phase was a set of fundus images like the one shown in Figure 2 B.

### Using grid cells for navigation [^f3e2d7fc]. Neuron (2015). Low credibility.

Algorithmic Solution in 2D

In 2D, the location of an activity bump can be defined by considering any two non-collinear axes (denoted by unit vectorsand). An activity bump at phasein module i then maps onto an infinite series of periodic locations+, wherecan be any pair of integers. We initially assume, for simplicity, that the orientations of different grid modules are aligned, i.e.andare independent of i and that grid firing fields are circularly symmetric as opposed to elliptical, i.e. the scale s i is the same for directionsand(but see). In this case, the location of an activity bump within grid module i can be visualized on a cylindrical polar plot as, whererepresents the direction of the grid axes (e.g.and). Considering the phases of the goal representation along each axis, and following the logic of the 1D solution, the distance and direction to the goal location is indicated by the maximum gradient of a plane through the origin that fits the phase points p j, i + 2 πn j, i for all modules i and axes j and lies within the capacity of the grid cell system (Figure 4 C).

Again, this result can be generalized to arbitrary current and goal locations by replacing the absolute phases p j, i that define the goal location with the phase difference Δp j, i between the current and goal locations on each axis and in each module. This solution is consistent with the Fourier shift theorem (see), with the sets of grid cells in each module that share a common phase on each axis acting as Fourier components of the spatial representation. If grid cell orientations are identical across modules, then the displacement between start and goal locations can be solved independently on each axis as in the 1D case: by finding the line through the origin that best fits the phase points along that axis. We note that it is sufficient to solve for two directions, as more axes do not provide additional independent information—the constraint thatfor 3 directions separated by 120° is implicitly included by fitting lines through the origin. However, given independent noise in the firing rates of biological neurons, pooling estimates across directions could potentially mitigate error in the extracted translation vector. Additionally, if grid cell orientations are not conserved across modules, or if grid firing fields are elliptical, then the solution still holds, but the plane must be fit to a family of phase points that differ in axesacross grid cell modules and in spatial scale s i across axes.

Numerical comparison of STM images for pattern recognition

For each calculated STM image, we determined the coordinates of the 20 largest local maxima and 20 largest local minima after Gaussian smoothing of the data with standard deviation of 0.23 Å. The smoothing was performed in order to obtain more well-defined gradients of the numerical data and thus to model the experimental data in a more sophisticated way considering the local extremum points. A point was accepted as a local maximum (minimum) if it had the maximum (minimum) value of the data within a radius of 0.7 Å. Similarly, we determined a few well-defined extrema from the experimental data (all of the extrema are shown in Fig. 4a, b in the main text). We concentrated the analysis to the central part of the cluster due to aberrations near the cluster edges caused by the tip-convolution effect.

We compared an experimental set of extremum coordinates to each computational set as follows. The extremum coordinates were first placed into the same coordinate system by setting the maximum height coordinates to origin. The nearest neighbor for each experimental coordinate was sought from the computational set, separately for local maxima and minima. Denoting the set of extremum coordinates from the experimental data as Q and the nearest neighbors from the calculated data as P (correspondingly ordered), the rotation and translation matrices R and T, respectively, were sought that minimize the root-mean-square distance between the sets Q and P’ = RP + T, using the algorithm introduced in ref. The fitted distance between the coordinate sets Q and P is thus read aswhere the summation index i runs from 1 to N that is the number of coordinates in Q. The distance D was minimized with respect to rotations of the experimental set of points around full circle to consider all the reasonable nearest-neighbors between the sets of coordinates. These minima are documented in Fig. 4d for each calculated image, compared to one of the experimental images.

For DFT calculations and system preparation we used open-source software available at. The custom-made computer code used in comparison of simulated and experimental STM images can be downloaded from the web link.

### Mouse visual cortex contains a region of enhanced spatial resolution [^b443a543]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The distribution of left/right focea locations (Fig. 8b and Supplementary Fig. 8b) was computed using a grid of equally spaced points in spherical coordinates (spacing 1°). The radius of the sphere was 10 cmand the head of the animal was placed at the center of the sphere (nose pointing at ele = 0° and azi = 0°). For each tracked left or right angular eye position and corresponding pitch/roll values, we computed the direction of the focea in spherical coordinates and increased the count of the grid point closest to the vector of length 15 cm starting at the eye center and pointing in the direction of the focea by 1. Repeating these steps for all angular eye positions across recordings yielded an approximation proportional to the distribution of focea directions in spherical coordinates. Elevations in Fig. 8d were computed from the marginal distribution (i.e. after summing over all azimuth values) either as circular mean (Fig. 8d, top) or circular standard deviation (Fig. 8d, bottom) using the CircStat toolbox.

To avoid that systematic changes in head tilt bias focea elevation for the different freely moving conditions, we used stratified sampling of the joint distributions of head pitch and roll values; that is, pitch and roll data for each condition were binned (5° bin size for both pitch and roll) and for each bin a random subset of samples were kept such that the frequency of pitch/roll values in that specific bin was equal across all conditions. The stratified datasets were used to compute focea elevation in Fig. 8d (20° ± 0° head-fixed, 16.3° ± 2.6° open field, 15.9° ± 2.4° social interaction, 17.0° ± 3.2° object tracking). The elevation for the control condition (“Focea fixed in head”) was computed using the same stratified data as the focea elevation (20° ± 0° head-fixed, 0.8° ± 0.8° open field, 0.8° ± 0.8° social interaction, 0.3° ± 1.3° object tracking). We repeated the same analysis with different torsion gain values (0.217 and 0.433). The precise torsion gain value had a rather small influence on focea elevation in freely moving mice: a change in torsion gain of 33% resulted in a 10% change in focea elevation (Supplemental Fig. 8d).

### A non-spatial account of place and grid cells based on clustering models of concept learning [^b4162208]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Simulation procedure and model specifications

At the beginning of the learning phase of each simulation run, we set the number of clusters, number of learning trials, the environment (square, circle), the learning rate, and the learning update batch size. The number of clusters were set (ranging from 10 to 30) and were initiated at random locations in the environment. The shape of the environment was defined by a set of points that could be visited by the agent. The square environment was 50 by 50, where each point was a location specified by a value on the x- and y-axis. The circular environment was defined by drawing a circle in Matlab with a radius of 50, and selecting the points within the bounds of the circle. The starting position and movement trajectory of the agent was then determined as a random walk over one million trials. The agent started at a random position and steps in the horizontal and vertical axes were computed separately. On each trial, the agent could go up, down, or stay on the vertical axis, and left, right, or stay on the horizontal axis. The step was sampled from [−4, −2, −1, −1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4], where negative values are steps to the left, positive steps are steps to the right, and zero means stay. Movement on the vertical dimension was determined in the same way, but negative values were upward steps and positive values were downwards steps. If the generated step brought the agent out of the environment, the step was cancelled and a new step was generated as above.

We considered a simple winner-take-all network in which only the cluster at position pos i closest to stimulus x (agent’s location) had a non-zero activation. Bold type is reserved for vectors. The distance between pos i and x is defined as:In the Kohonen learning rule, cluster i updates its position pos i to move toward stimulus x according to:where η t is the learning rate at time t. In the present simulations, we used batch updating to increase numerical stability in which 200 updates were performed simultaneously. The learning rate η for batch time t followed an annealing schedule:where η 0 is the initial learning rate set to 0.25 and ρ is the annealing rate set to 0.02.

### Noradrenergic arousal after encoding reverses the course of systems consolidation in humans [^89aecbeb]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

ROI definition: The anatomical mask for the hippocampus was derived from the Harvard-Oxford subcortical atlas using a probability threshold of 50%. For the IFG and vmPFC, a sphere with 20 mm radius was used that was centered on the peak voxel (x = −50, y = 16, z = 12) derived from 386 imaging studies reporting “IFG” and on the peak voxel (x = −2, y = 46, z = −8) derived from 199 imaging studies reporting “vmPFC”, respectively, as determined by meta-analyses conducted on the neurosynth.org platform (status 26/02/2021).

Univariate fMRI analysis: Due to the overall very high memory performance resulting in a low number of misses and false alarms in many participants, we modelled our imaging data based on stimulus category and chose a correlative approach to link these data to behavioral memory performance. On the first level, the functional MRI data were analyzed using general linear modeling (GLM) as implemented in SPM12. For the univariate analysis, the model included one regressor per run and per emotion for the encoding task (6 regressors) and one regressor per emotion and stimulus category for the recognition task (8 regressors) as well as 6 run constants as regressors of no interest. The resulting 20 regressors were convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function. A high-pass filter of 128 s was used to remove low-frequency drifts and serial correlations in the time series were accounted for using an autoregressive AR(1)-model.

### Separability and geometry of object manifolds in deep neural networks [^1cb960a5]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Geometric properties of manifolds

For a given manifold, its anchor pointdepends on the other manifolds in the ensemble. In the mean-field theory, summarized above, this dependence is captured statistically, by the dependence of the anchor point projection on the manifold subspaces, denoted byon the random vector, representing the random contributions to the separating plane from other manifolds. Thus, the Gaussian statistics ofinduces a statistical measure on the manifold’s anchor points (projected on the manifolds subspcaces). Since the anchor points determine the separating hyperplane, their statistics, and in particular the induced effective radius and dimension, plays an important role in the classification capacity.

The effective radius and dimension are specified in terms of, the projection of the anchor pointonto the D + 1-dimensional subspace of each manifold,, relative to the manifold center, S 0, capturing the statistics of the variation of the points in the D -dimensional subspace of manifold variability. Here, the variation of these points is normalized by the manifold center norm; as the centers are random this is equivalent, up to a constant, to normalizing by the average distance between the manifold centers. Then the manifold radius is the total variance of the normalized anchor points,The effective dimension quantifies the spread of the anchor points along the different manifold axes and is defined by the angular spread between(where T 0 isprojected on the center S 0) and the corresponding anchor pointin the manifold subspace:whereis a unit vector in the direction of. In the case where the manifold has an isotropic shape,(for detailed derivation see Section 4-D of ref.).

Importantly, the theory provides a precise connection between of manifold capacity and the effective manifold dimensionality and radius, which can be concisely summarized as:where α Ball (R, D) is the expression for the capacity of L 2 balls with radius R and dimension D (see ref.and Supplementary Eq. (4)). This relation holds for D M ≫ 1 and is an excellent approximation for all cases considered here. For a general manifold we interpret the radius as maximal variation per dimension (in units of the manifold’s center norm) while the dimension as the number of effective axes of variation, with the manifold’s total extent given by.

### Pre-processing visualization of hyperspectral fluorescent data with spectrally encoded enhanced representations [^cedf0620]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Tensor map

Visualization of statistics on the phasor plot is performed by means of the mathematical gradient. The gradient is obtained in a two-step process.

First, we compute the two-dimensional derivative of the phasor plot histogram counts by utilizing an approximation of the second order accurate central difference.

Each bin F (g, s) has a central difference:,, with respect to the differences in g (horizontal) and s (vertical) directions with unitary spacing h. The approximation becomes

Similarly

Second, we calculate the square root of the sum of squared differences D (s,g) asobtaining the magnitude of the derivative density counts. With this gradient histogram, we then connect the phasor coordinates with same D (s, g) gradients with one contour. All gradients are then normalized to (0,1). Finally, pixels in the hyperspectral image corresponding to the same contour in phasor space will be rendered the same color. In the reference map, red represents highly dense gradients, usually at the center of a phasor cluster. Blue, instead, represents the sparse gradient that appears at the edge circumference of the phasor distributions.

Scale mode

In this mode, the original square standard reference maps are transformed to a new boundary box adapted to each dataset’s spectral distribution.

The process of transformation follows these steps. We first determine the boundary box (width ω, height h) based on the cluster appearance on the phasor plot. We then determine the largest ellipsoid that fits in the boundary box. Finally, we warp the unit circle of the original map to the calculated ellipsoid.

Using polar coordinates, we represent each point P of the standard reference map with phasor coordinates (g i, s i) as

The ellipsoid has semi-major axesand semi-minor axes

Therefore, the ellipse equation becomes

Where rad is a ratio used to scale each radius r i in the reference map to a proportionally corresponding distance in the boundary box-adapted ellipse, which in polar coordinates becomes

Each point P (g i, s i) of the standard reference map is geometrically scaled to a new coordinate (g o, s o) inside the ellipsoid using forward mapping, obtaining the equation

This transform is applied to all standard reference maps to generate the respective scaled versions.

Each unit is assigned points A, B, and C, and coordinate systems A, B 1, B 2, and C, as illustrated in Fig. 9a–d. Because the positions of the coordinate systems do not affect the subsequent calculations, the coordinate systems can be located anywhere. Only the orientation of coordinate systems is crucial. Two dihedral angles between the rings in the ligand, denoted as θ 1 and θ 2, are defined as shown in Fig. 9a–d (0 ≤ θ 1, θ 2 ≤ 90°). To specify the rotation direction of the dihedral angles (R or L), integers j and k are introduced as follows.

Boundary-dominated first-order topological states in hyperbolic Chern insulators

We start by briefly introducing the projection scheme of a hyperbolic plane with a uniform negative curvature in the (2 + 1)-dimensional Minkowski space onto a complex unit disk. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, under the stereographic projection with the reference point located at (x = 0, y = 0, t = −1), a hyperboloid defined by t 2 − x 2 − y 2 = 1 could be mapped to a unit disk at t = 0, where the geodesics on the ﻿hyperboloid (green lines) are projected to circular arcs perpendicular to boundaries of the disk. Such a unit disk is called the Poincaré disk equipped with the hyperbolic metric. Based on this projection scheme, the hyperbolic lattice, which is ﻿a discrete tessellation of the two-dimensional hyperbolic space, could be mapped to the Poincaré disk.

### Allocating kidneys in optimized heterogeneous circles [^45f5b1e9]. American Journal of Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Recently, the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network approved a plan to allocate kidneys within 250-nm circles around donor hospitals. These homogeneous circles might not substantially reduce geographic differences in transplant rates because deceased donor kidney supply and demand differ across the country. Using Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data from 2016-2019, we used an integer program to design unique, heterogeneous circles with sizes between 100 and 500 nm that reduced supply/demand ratio variation across transplant centers. We weighted demand according to wait time because candidates who have waited longer have higher priority. We compared supply/demand ratios and average travel distance of kidneys, using heterogeneous circles and 250 and 500-nm fixed-distance homogeneous circles. We found that 40% of circles could be 250 nm or smaller, while reducing supply/demand ratio variation more than homogeneous circles. Supply/demand ratios across centers for heterogeneous circles ranged from 0.06 to 0.13 kidneys per wait-year, compared to 0.04 to 0.47 and 0.05 to 0.15 kidneys per wait-year for 250-nm and 500-nm homogeneous circles, respectively. The average travel distance for kidneys using heterogeneous, and 250-nm and 500-nm fixed-distance circles was 173 nm, 134 nm, and 269 nm, respectively. Heterogeneous circles reduce geographic disparity compared to homogeneous circles, while maintaining reasonable travel distances.

### K-space interpretation of the rose model: noise limitation on the detectable resolution in MRI [^94ed9ed6]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Noise limitation on the detected spatial resolution, described by the Rose Model, is well known in X-ray imaging and routinely used in designing X-ray imaging protocols. The purpose of this article is to revisit the Rose Model in the context of MRI where image data are acquired in the spatial frequency domain. A k-space signal-to-noise ratio (kSNR) is introduced to measure the relative signal and noise powers in a circular annulus in k-space. It is found that the kSNR diminishes rapidly with k-space radius. The Rose criterion that the voxel SNR approximately 4 is translated to kSNR cutoff values was tested using theoretical derivation and experimental histogram analysis. Experiments demonstrate that data acquisition beyond this cutoff k-space radius adds little or no information to the image. In order to reduce the noise limit on spatial resolution, the signal strength must be improved through means such as increasing the coil sensitivity, contrast enhancement, and signal averaging. This finding implies that the optimal k-space volume to be sampled or the optimal scan time in MRI should be matched to the relative SNR level.

### Mechanical properties of rubble pile asteroids (dimorphos, itokawa, ryugu, and bennu) through surface boulder morphological analysis [^09318d20]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The maximum inscribed circle (blue circle in Supplementary Fig. 32) is found by computing the Euclidian distance transform of the particlewith the bwdist function in the Image Processing MATLAB ToolBox. The distance transform computes the minimum distance to the contour from each pixel inside the particle. The maximum value of the distance transform map corresponds to the most enclosed point of the particle that is the furthest away from the contours. The maximum inscribed circle has a radius equal to the maximum value of the distance transform.

Roundness, R, indicates the relative curvature of the projected shape of the particle. It quantifies the sharpness of its corners and edges,,. The definition of roundnessis the ratio of the average radius of curvature of the corners of the particle to the radius of the maximum inscribed circle (Supplementary Fig. 33):with N being the number of corners, r i the radius of each corner circle and r i n s the radius of the largest inscribing circle. Higher roundness indicates the particle is more round and lower roundness indicates the particle is more angular.

In order to find the corners of the particle and their associated radius r i, the discrete curvature around the smoothed contour is computed. The contour is smoothed by 5% with the LOESS (LOcally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing)method as a means to remove the angular/square shape contour from the pixels. The curvature γ of a 2D closed line is the second derivative of the contour coordinates. A curvature equal to 0 corresponds to a straight line. A negative (γ < 0) and positive (γ > 0) curvature are concave and convex points, respectively. For one given point of curvature γ p, the associated radius r p is its inverse, as.

In Wadell’s definition, the corner circle’s radius cannot be larger than the radius of the maximum inscribed circle (r i < = r i n s). Therefore, a corner is defined by being successive concave points of a curvature higher or equal to 1/ r i n s. For each corner, the local maximum of the curvature is identified, and corresponds to the radius of the biggest circle that can fit in the corner.

### Parkinsonism disrupts cortical function by dysregulating oscillatory, network and synaptic activity of parvalbumin positive interneurons [^93e30e13]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Our results suggest that, despite the symmetric loss of PV-INs, their synaptic output is selectively upregulated in the ipsilateral hemisphere. This mismatch indicates the presence of a compensatory mechanism, potentially involving an increase in the strength of synaptic contacts formed by the long-range PV-INs to counterbalance the loss of inhibitory neurons.

To assess morphological complexity of PV-IN, we performed 3D dendritic reconstructions (Fig. 3 L) and 3D Sholl analysis (Fig. 3M, two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test F Radius (139, 1820) = 199.2 p < 0.0001, F Group (3, 1820) = 36.83 p < 0.0001), revealing a significant reduction in total branching points in the ipsilateral hemisphere of 6-OHDA-lesioned mice compared to the contralateral side (Fig. 3N, two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test F Groups × Hemisphere (1, 14) = 11.82 p = 0.0040, F Hemisphere (1, 14) = 11,45 p = 0.0045; contra vs. ipsi 6-OHDA = 0.0009; CNT vs. 6-OHDA ipsi p = 0,032). These findings suggest that dopamine depletion may induce dendritic atrophy in PV-INs, potentially disrupting local circuit organization, impairing their ability to maintain inhibitory network stability and recruiting long-range connections.

### Repeatability and reproducibility of a new method for centration analysis via optical zone tangent points after corneal refractive surgery [^b2d76798]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Accurate alignment of corneal ablation is crucial in corneal refractive surgeries to optimize visual outcomes. The pupil center shifts with changes in pupil size under different lighting conditions. The corneal vertex is a stable reference for the cornea and has been recommended as the central alignment point for corneal laser refractive surgery. It has also been shown to be closest to the corneal intersection of the visual axis.To date, there is no specific standard for determining the center of the optical zone, and few studies have investigated and compared methods used for assessing decentration after corneal refractive surgery.

This new method used to analyze decentration in our study was named as square method. The measurement approach reported by Lin’s group is similar but not identical to ours. They also marked the maximum edges of the ablation on the x and y axes, but the center of the ablation was estimated as the intersection of these four points. When the shape of the OZ is irregular, the center of the OZ obtained directly from the intersection of the four points may exaggerate the degree of decentration. In the overlay grid method the lines of the grid were distributed equally with 0.1 mm steps and the concentric circles had radii increasing in 0.1 mm steps. The x and y coordinates of the centration offset between the center of the optical zone and the corneal vertex were measured to the nearest 0.05 mm. In our method, the steps of the coordinates of each tangent point obtained from the difference maps were 0.01 mm and the coordinates of COZ were measured to the nearest 0.005 mm. As the overlay grid method does not have a clear criterion for selecting the best-fitting circle of the OZ, it is possible to introduce more human error when it is oval or irregular. Compared to this approach, the coordinates used to calculate the center of the OZ in our study were obtained directly on the Pentacam difference maps without any additional grid. The shape of the OZ has no significant effect on the location of the four tangent points and therefore has less effect on the location of the COZ. Theoretically, when the shape of the OZ is a regular circle, the location of the OZ center obtained by the method of this study should be consistent with the results of the overlay grid method. The ratio of the cylinder to the sphere may affect the shape of the OZ. In our study, this ratio is(0.00 to 0.71) and this does not significantly affect our results.

For balanced design with an equal number of subjects for each group (MZ and DZ twins), three samples are considered with the size of n = 100, 300, 1,000. For instance, the sample of 100 subjects is comprised of 25 MZ twin pairs (50 subjects) and 25 DZ twin pairs (50 subjects). For the unbalanced design, the sample size is fixed as n = 300, and we consider the MZ:DZ ratios being 1:4 and 4:1, that is, n = 60 + 240 and n = 240 + 60.

Apart from the Gaussian random error, we also take into account the case where the error term is not normally distributed. Here we consider a log‐normally distributed unique environmental random noise. The sample considered is balanced with the size of n = 300, that is, the number of MZ and DZ twin pairs is identical.

In total, 5 samples with balanced/unbalanced design and Gaussian/non‐Gaussian random error, along with 15 (A, C, E) parameter settings, lead to totally 90 simulation settings. For each setting, we consider both the one sample model (10) and multiple linear regression (15) to fit SqD's. For the one sample model, no covariates are included in the model (3) and the design matrix is an all‐ones vector. For multiple linear regression, age, sex, the interaction between age and sex and a standard normally distributed continuous variable are included as covariates. The regressors are simulated using Matlab. X thus has five columns, in which the first column is an all‐ones vector for the intercept and the remaining are randomly generated vectors approximating the four covariates. Results are based on 1,000 realisations.

### Computer aided quantification for retinal lesions in patients with moderate and severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy: a retrospective cohort study [^260417bb]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Results

After threshold segmentation and labeling, the numbers and areas of each exudate were automatically obtained for further analysis (Figure 3), after statistical analysis, the exudates/disk ratio in the severe group (3.2 ± 1.1) increased than that of the moderate group (1.8 ± 1.1) (P < 0.05).

After Otsu segmentation (Figure 4 a), the binary values were inverted to make blood vessels and microaneurysms as white structures (Figure 4 b). The original image was subtracted by the image after erosion (2-pixel disk structure element) and further dilation (1-pixel disk structure element) was performed to obtain microaneurysms (Figure 4 c).

For Hough detection, the highest peaks are corresponded to a particular radius in the accumulator data (Figure 5 a). If the height of the peaks is equal compared to the number of edge pixels for a circle with the particular radius, the coordinates of the peaks does probably correspond to the center of such a circle (Figure 5 b). In this study, we identified the number of microaneurysms automatically and overlapped the results in segmented retinal images (Figure 5 c).

### All-optical geometric image transformations enabled by ultrathin metasurfaces [^e131c144]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Geometric transformation for binary images

With the optimized meta-atom design in hand, we employed metasurfaces with minimized neighboring-coupling-induced phase errors to perform geometric image transformations. We initially demonstrated the geometric transformation for binary images (i.e. images whose pixels have two possible intensity values: 0 and 1) and realized Cartesian to log-polar coordinate transformation as an example. In this instance, the metasurface transforms an image with unity transmittance in the Cartesian coordinate to a deformed image in the log-polar coordinate, simultaneously converting the in-plane rotation and scale variations of the input image into translations of the transformed image.

To comprehend the properties of log-polar transformation, we considered an arbitrary point (P) in the Cartesian coordinatemapping to point P’ in the log-polar coordinate(Fig. 3). Assuming the length of the segment OP is r and the orientation of OP is α, the coordinates of P’ can be written aswith two scale factorsand. For example, mapping a circular ring from the Cartesian into the log-polar coordinates results in a rectangle (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, we can observe that the scale of r and the increment of α are converted to a linear shift alongandaxes, respectively, in log-polar coordinate. As a result, the original image is transformed into a reformed image that is immune to scale and rotation variations, except for certain translations in the new coordinate.

### Using unsupervised capsule neural network reveal spatial representations in the human brain [^77a15ed2]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

2.7 Calculation of visual spatial features

We manually calculated some common location and distance features to characterize the spatial distribution and dispersion degree of the circles. These features were (1) the number of circles in each quadrant (every 90 degrees is a quadrant) and (2) the center position of the graph, in X and Y coordinates, surrounded by small circles. (3) The average distance between each circle and the fixation cross. (4) The average distance between each circle and the origin (bottom left corner of the picture). (5) The average distance between the circles (if there is only one circle in the picture, the distance is 0). Spatial location features (SLFs) include (1) and (2), and spatial distance features (SDFs) include (3)–(5). VFN & SFN concatenates the L2‐Norm of principal components (PCs) of the image, L2‐Norm of SLFs, and L2‐Norm of SDFs, representing the abstract features of the image.

2.8 Unsupervised capsule neural network model

We designed an unsupervised U‐CapsNet based on an encoder‐decoder architecture to reconstruct input features. The encoder is a simple CapsNet and the decoder is implemented by deconvolution. The CapsNet consists of three layers: convolutional layers, primary capsule layer, and higher capsule layer. A fully connected layer links the encoder and decoder. The decoder consists of three sequential deconvolution layers. The parameter settings of the network are shown in Table S1. The dynamic routing process occurs between the primary capsule layer and the higher capsule layer. For more details and principles in the CapsNet refer to Sabour et al.

The vector (capsule)is transformed to form a predicted vectorwhich predicts the output of the capsule 𝑖 to higher capsule 𝑗.denotes the weight matrix, which is trainable.

### Non-canonical wnt signaling promotes directed migration of intestinal stem cells to sites of injury [^3206081a]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Analysis of migration directionality

To assay ISC accumulation around the periphery of the wound in fixed, ablated intestines (Supplementary 2c), the ISC numbers within a 40 µm radius of the ablation site were counted and compared with the ISC numbers within the same area of the contralateral side of the intestine. ISCs within the ablation site area on the contralateral side were not counted. For undamaged controls, ISCs were counted on contralateral sides of the intestine in a 200 µm × 200 µm area. To quantify the angle of ISC protrusions in relation to the wound of an ablated gut (Supplementary Fig 2a), the angle was measured between the vector of the shortest distance from the center of the cell body to the periphery of the wound and the vector from the center of the cell body to the center of the leading edge. To plot ISC position in ablated tissue (Supplementary 2b), the periphery of the wound closest to a given ISC was designated as the center of the Cartesian plane (0,0). The starting position of the ISC was the x,y coordinate of the cell cortex closest to the wound immediately after ablation, and normalized to the x,y coordinate of the wound periphery closest to the ISC. The ending position of the ISC was the x,y coordinate of the cell cortex closest to the wound 4.5 hrs post-ablation, and normalized to the x,y coordinate of the wound periphery closest to the ISC. For example, if the x,y coordinate of an ISC was measured at 108, 148 and the wound was measured at 133, 148, the wound would be set at 0,0 and the normalized x,y coordinate of the ISC would be −25, 0. In control, unablated tissue, a single arbitrary point in the middle of the gut was designated as the center of the Cartesian plane (0,0). ISC position was determined by the x,y coordinate of the cell cortex closest to the designated point, and normalized to the x,y coordinate of the designated point. Change in displacement was calculated from the difference in distance between the starting ISC position and the Cartesian origin, and the ending ISC position and the Cartesian origin.

Vessel density, tortuosity, and fractal dimension—extraction and associations: Extraction of pulmonary vascular data from imaging can be automated or semiautomated, with arteries and veins automatically mapped, peripherally matched, and classified; loss of pulmonary vascular density or distal pulmonary artery (PA) blood volume is associated with right heart failure indices in smokers, emphysema progression, and asthma severity. Vessel tortuosity can be determined by comparing the linear distance between two points on a vessel with the actual 3D path length, and this distance metric is increased in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and correlated with mean PA pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and arterial and venous oxygen content and saturation. Fractal dimension may be determined by lung cube counting across scales where the slope of the linear portion of a double logarithmic plot defines fractal dimension, or estimated from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) perfusion scans by calculating the relative dispersion (standard deviation/ mean) in progressively smaller blocks and evaluating the slope of log relative dispersion versus log number of voxels averaged.

The echo‐planar k ‐space trajectory for MRSI (EPSI) (Figure 1 A) was generated with phase encoding along one spatial dimension (k y) and an oscillating readout gradient along the other (k x ‐ t plane). 20 The EPSI k ‐space data are scanned in a zigzag k x ‐ t trajectory and collected using both odd and even echoes.

### Simple spatial scaling rules behind complex cities [^23b5e063]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Spatial scaling

Our simple rules produce the AP, road network, and socioeconomic interaction distributions (see Fig. 1b, c). The AP distribution and its morphology are in good agreement with the real city of Greater London (see Fig. 1d).

The model allows us to quantify these predictions. According to the SA mechanism, when t is sufficiently large the spatial distribution of AP is approximatelywhere ρ (r, t) is the average density at distance r from the city centre, i.e. the seed node at position (0, 0), R (t) is the radius of the entire city at time t (see Fig. 2b and further details of the explicit form of ρ (r, t) are in Supplementary Note 1), and β is a parameter derived from C. The dependence of β on C (see Fig. 2a) can be derived by the non-linear fitting, and the simulation results are shown in Fig. 2b. Figure 2c shows that the collected data validate Eq. (4). The AP in the real data is defined as a mixture of working and residential populations according to their active duration in that region (see Methods). In the downtown area (i.e. when r / R (t) → 0), the AP density decays following the power law shown in Eq. (4) (see Fig. 2c). In contrast, residential population density decays exponentially as we move from city centre to urban fringe, as verified in previous researchand our data (see Supplementary Fig. 8). This reconciles the conflict between area-size allometry and the exponential decay of population from city centre to urban fringe found in the literature. To eliminate the influence of noise in the empirical data and allow an unbiased comparison of different quantities, we study the cumulative quantities in terms of the distance from the central area instead of the local density (see Fig. 3). Integrating Eq. (4) we obtainwhere P (r, t) is the cumulative AP within the concentric circle of the central area with radius r (see Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig. 7 for detailed derivations). This expression is approximately a power law with an exponent 2 − β when. This is consistent with the fractal city hypothesis, and the fractal dimension is 2 − β if the distributions of APs and buildings are similar. We can similarly calculate the cumulative road length and socioeconomic interactions asandTherefore the exponents of the cumulative length of the road network and socioeconomic interactions within the circle of radius r are 2 − β /2 and 2 − 3 β /2. These predictions are consistent with the data from Beijing and London shown in Fig. 3. Due to the need for high-resolution data, we use nighttime light as the proxy for socioeconomic interactions –. Although nighttime light data has some intrinsic disadvantages when representing high-resolution interactions (e.g. at a community level, because luminosity is also associated with road density and type of land use), it remains the best candidate among open-source data. We show that as long as the spatial resolution is not excessively high it is a good proxy (see Methods, Supplementary Figs. 10 and 12 – 14 and Supplementary Note 6 for further discussion). Thus based on Eqs. (5)–(7) we can obtain all the other spatial scaling exponents from any single observation.

### Human navigation strategies and their errors result from dynamic interactions of spatial uncertainties [^f92daba7]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Data preprocessing & replication of prior analysis

All endpoint data, i.e. empirical data from the respective studies and data from model simulations, were reanalyzed following the procedures used in prior work –. We normalized homing responses for each homing location by centering them within a common coordinate system, with either the actual homing direction as the north-directionor centered around the true target location,. Outliers were removed based on distances to the mean location within each condition by excluding those trials that exceeded the third quartile by three times the interquartile range,. For data of Chen et al.and Zhao & Warren, we also removed biases in the four individual target locations before pooling them together so as not to increase response variability artificially. After pooling data from all four target locations, we computed the response variability for each of the simulated and real participants in each of the four conditions. We did so either as the standard deviation of the Euclidean distances (or heading directions) between the response locations for each trial or the mean response location (or heading) across all trials. We used computed response variances for the two single cue conditions (self-motion and landmark) to predict response variance for the combined cue condition according to the perceptual cue integration model for Euclidean distance, or heading direction. We considered the integration of cues statistically optimal when the reduction in response variability in the combined cue conditions can be predicted from response variability in single cue conditions (Equation (5)). Further, we used mean responses in conflict conditions to predict relative response proximity to the landmark or self-motion-defined target locations. We compared them with optimal predictions based on response variability. All data were analyzed at the single participant level if not indicated otherwise.

### UV photonic integrated circuits for far-field structured illumination autofluorescence microscopy [^829690f9]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

To illustrate the flexibility of UV-PICs, we have designed chips for which the grating out-couplers enable an excitation numerical aperture as large as NA ex = 0.9. The theoretical enhancement factorof the optical resolution amounts to 2.35 for NA ex = 0.9, NA col = 0.95 and the current excitation and emission wavelengths. Using index-matching liquids between the chip and the borosilicate microscope slide, the refractive index of which (n = 1.54) is smaller than that of aluminum oxide (n = 1.69) at λ ex = 360 nm, even enhancement factors as large as 3.3 are in principle reachable. Note also that the larger the emission wavelength relative to the excitation wavelength, the larger the enhancement factor.

The fringe patterns obtained with the NA ex = 0.9 gratings are free of distortion for the three directions of illumination, as shown in Fig. 4. The fringe spacing of 199 nm is in line with the designed numerical aperture. The visibilities are slightly lower than that of the case of NA ex = 0.5, with values of 0.723, 0.774 and 0.737 for orientation D 1, D 2, and D 3, respectively. The SIM imaging with the NA ex = 0.9 illumination is able to resolve a sector spacing of 166 nm over the intensity profile of an entire circular cross-section of radius r = 1.9 μm, implying an optical resolution enhancement factor of 1.84. Even if the enhancement factor is larger than for the case of NA ex = 0.5, the difference with the expected theoretical value (2.35) is quite significant. In addition to the contribution of the limited SNR of the camera, we attribute this difference to a less dense and less homogeneous distribution of the fluorescent dyes when the spacing between the sectors shrinks. The possibility to optically resolve the sector spacing for some limited parts of the intensity profiles of the circular cross-sections when the radius is lower than r = 1.9 μm supports this last point.

### Single molecule fate of HIV-1 envelope reveals late-stage viral lattice incorporation [^8136843c]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Monte Carlo simulation of errors in angular measurement

To assess the overall accuracy measurement of the angular probability distribution of Env from aligned multicolor 3D superresolution imaging data sets, we simulated the Gag shell, local membrane plane, and Env localization centroids residing precisely at the equator (φ = 0°). The Env centroid and localization uncertainty were modeled as a Dirac δ function (σ φ → 0°) to assess the effects of both Gag shell fitting and uncertainties in the principle component analysis of the approximated membrane plane. The localization precisions in the x, y, and z -dimension for all simulated channels were selected pseudorandomly from a normal distribution centered at the estimated mean localization precisions measured for each fluorescent probe averaged over all data sets (Supplementary Fig. 1). We additionally simulated the small registration errors between the three superresolution channels, by randomly displacing the simulation structures from one another along a random vector distributed about the mean σ registration(x, y, z) averaged over all data sets (1):To simulate the uncertainty in the fit radius, localizations for the red Gag channel were first expanded pseudorandomly on a sphere with a radius estimated from our measured mean cluster radius, in good agreement with the actual shell radius of HIV-1 Gag. All Gag localizations were then pseudorandomly displaced from the sphere surface using a lognormal distribution estimated from the mean standard error measurement of all Gag shell fits (σ shell fitting = 13.94 nm). The number of localizations per Gag cluster was pseudorandomly selected from the mean and standard deviation of the empirically derived number of Gag localizations per particle (mean = 147.65 ± 6.90 localizations per cluster; n = 2183 clusters). To simulate the uncertainty in the principle component analysis of the membrane plane angles, we modeled the individual membrane planes as Gaussian point cloud discs with σ x, y, z estimated from the empirically measured mean of the standard deviations of localization positions for all individual single HIV-1 assembly sites in this study (mean σ x / y = 76.91 nm and σ z = 29.72 nm; see Supplementary Fig. 5). The randomized localization centroids were bounded in the X - and Y -dimensions at an area of 4.0 × 10 4 nm 2 (200 × 200 nm) to simulate the boxcar segmentation of individual assembly sites adjacent to one another. We used the empirically measured mean localizations per plane (257 ± 11 localizations; s.e.m. n = 1980 planes) for pseudorandomly seeding localizations into each plane. Env localizations and membrane plane point clouds were affine transformed about the Gag cluster center pseudorandomly to simulate alterations in the virus bud polarity axis relative to the microscope reference axis. Membrane planes and the single Env localization were displaced pseudorandomly from the Gag centroid, along the simulated budding axis, to mimic the lognormal distribution of bud neck lengths observed with empirically derived data (Supplementary Fig. 6 ; 127 ± 38 nm from the centroid of the membrane plane to the centroid of the Gag cluster). Simulated HIV-1 assembly sites with a fixed Env angular orientation (Dirac function), which were pseudorandomly modified to incorporate the stochastic parameters described above, were then processed (identical to empirically derived data) using our particle processing software.

### Nuclear fission modes and fragment mass asymmetries in a five-dimensional deformation space [^6c6f5020]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Nuclei undergoing fission can be described by a multi-dimensional potential-energy surface that guides the nuclear shape evolution--from the ground state, through intermediate saddle points and finally to the configurations of separated fission fragments. Until now, calculations have lacked adequate exploration of the shape parameterization of sufficient dimensionality to yield features in the potential-energy surface (such as multiple minima, valleys, saddle points and ridges) that correspond to characteristic observables of the fission process. Here we calculate and analyse five-dimensional potential-energy landscapes based on a grid of 2,610,885 deformation points. We find that observed fission features--such as the distributions of fission fragment mass and kinetic energy, and the different energy thresholds for symmetric and asymmetric fission--are very closely related to topological features in the calculated five-dimensional energy landscapes.

### Rational approximation of golden angles: accelerated reconstructions for radial MRI [^05a94a6b]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2.5 | Numerical stability of RAGA sampling

In RAGA sampling, the index of the projection angle in the equidistant angular pattern follows from Equation (10) with the integers, and. Due to exact integer arithmetic the indexis bitwise reproducible. Inaccuracies due to floating point arithmetic are therefore only introduced by the multiplication of the indexwith the base anglefrom Equation (8). This error does not propagate beyond a single repetition of the equidistant pattern rendering RAGA sampling numerically robust. In contrast, golden ratio sampling is sensitive to numerical inaccuracies which accumulate over time.

2.2.6 | Data storage and processing characteristics

In RAGA sampling all acquired samples are members of an equidistant angular pattern. This leads to the flexibility to use either of both trajectories for image reconstruction (Figure 3). With RAGA ordering, the data can be flexibly rebinned to retrospectively select the temporal resolution exactly as in golden ratio schemes. Reconstructions of golden ratio datasets require that the angle between consecutive spokesis stored together with the data. In contrast, for RAGA sampling the anglecan be recovered from the total number of spokes in a full frameand the RAGA increment. Both are quantities which are typically stored with the data similar to the Cartesian case. A full frame of data can be compactly stored and reconstructed with a simple equidistant angular scheme. Here, not even the acquisition index of the spokes is required, and a long time series naturally decomposes into repeating full frames, which simplifies extraction and reconstruction of time periods. Given the index of the second spoke in a full frame, the angle between temporally consecutive spokes and the full RAGA scheme can be recovered. After rebinning, the selected spokes for each frame can be stored in a zero-filled k-space corresponding to a full frame as illustrated in Figure 3.

On the pachymetry difference map, the positions of four tangent points marked with a black cross are located on the smallest circle containing the maximum pachymetric difference. Examiners could also judge the location of the tangent point by moving the mouse and observing the changes in the values of the coordinates and thickness during the measurement process.

### Sphere of arbitrarily polarized exceptional points with a single planar metasurface [^1d03c06b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Topological properties of arbitrary EP

We previously showed that an EP-induced reflection zero enables us to accumulate a topological phase covering the fullrange by encircling the EP within a rationally chosen two-dimensional parameter space. In the following, we demonstrate that relying on the topological phase accumulated while encircling an EP exhibiting arbitrarily polarized eigenstate (linearly, circularly, and elliptically polarized cases correspond to the first, second, and third column in Fig. 2, respectively), we can manipulate the phase of light on a single polarization channel for any arbitrary polarization with a single metasurface by varying incidence conditions. To observe the EP complex-square-root dependency of the eigenvalue surfaces, we plot the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues in the two-dimensional parameter space of, corresponding to the rotation angles of the two metallic nanorods. These two parameters are expected to control the co- and cross-polarization ratio,. By sweeping them in the vicinity of the parameters corresponding to the EP with linearly polarized eigenstates, the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of the reflection matrix present two intersecting Riemann surfaces, which coalesce at the EP (See Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5). Furthermore, at the intersecting point, the reflection coefficient ofcomponent is zero (singularity), as shown in Fig. 3a, consistent with the EP nature of this coalescence point. As we previously pointed out, we obtain a phase winding around the EP singularity that realizes a fullphase coverage, of interest for the design of polarization-converting metasurfaces. It should be noted that due to its topological nature, the accumulated phase always coversregardless of the trajectory followed in parameter space, as long as the loop encircles the conversion zero in reflection. EP-induced topological phase can thus be employed for hologram construction by choosing four unit-cell designs sufficiently far away enough from the zero point to have higher efficiency, corresponding to four different rotation angles around the singularity center (indicated by the black triangles in Fig. 3a). EPs with circularly polarized coalesced eigenstates are also realized, as presented in the second column of Fig. 3, where we obtain similar degeneracy of eigenvalues and an equivalent topological phase pattern (Fig. 3b). For completeness, the last column shows an example of EP with elliptically polarized coalesced eigenstates, characterized by. The topological phase still shows the 2winding, as shown in Fig. 3c. It is worth mentioning that, for a fixed geometry, other arbitrarily polarized topological phases can also be realized under different incident conditions. In contrast, the other anti-diagonal channel of the reflection matrix reveals no topological phase, as illustrated in Fig. 3d–f, corresponding to the EPs showing linear, circular, and elliptical polarization, respectively. Overall, this demonstrates that the topological phase accompanying an EP in a two-dimensional parameter space can be designed to act on any arbitrary polarization state and, thus, allows to modulate the wavefront of any polarization. With the detailed four structures around each EP summarized in Fig. 3g (black triangles in Fig. 3a–f), a 2phase variation can be covered and used for wavefront manipulation. The corresponding amplitudes are shown in Fig. 3h. Building on this design versatility and exploiting the 2phase acquired by beams of adequate polarization when encircling EPs with coalesced eigenstate of the same polarization, we can fabricate a single metasurface simultaneously displaying EPs for three different polarizations (linear, circular, and elliptical). In the following section, we illustrate this by spectrally and spatially monitoring the occurrence of zeros in one anti-diagonal Jones matrix component, while the other components are nonzero. In the last section, we combine the full capabilities of our approach to produce one and the same meta-holograms generated thanks to the 2ET phase for three different polarizations (illustration shown in Fig. 3i).

### Using grid cells for navigation [^f5d9ba0e]. Neuron (2015). Low credibility.

Algorithmic Solution in 1D

The cyclical nature of the grid representation within each module i is such that an activity bump at phase p i implicitly represents an infinite set of “unwrapped” phases p i + 2 πn i, where n i can take any integer value, corresponding to an infinite set of distances s i (p i /2 π + n i) along that 1D axis that are separated by the scale s i of module i. Initially, we assume that all phases are zero at the current location a and the distance d to a goal location b must be inferred from the grid cell representation across modules at that location { p i (b)} = { p 1 (b), p 2 (b),…, p M (b)}. The grid representation of the goal location b is such that there is a set of unwrapped phases (one for each module) that explicitly represent the same distance—i.e. there is a set of integers { n i } for which:

Graphically, this coherent set of unwrapped phases across modules falls on a horizontal line when plotted against a y axis of represented distance (i.e. y = d ; Figure 4 A) or, equivalently, on a straight line through the origin when plotted against a y axis of phase against inverse grid scale (Equation 2 ; Figure 4 B)—i.e. there is a set of integers { n i } for which:

This latter relationship is obtained by re-arranging Equation 1 and corresponds to the Fourier shift theorem (see discussion of the Algorithmic Solution in 2D below;). Thus, the distance d to a goal location represented by the set of module phases { p i } can be inferred by fitting a straight line through the origin on a plot of unwrapped phases p i + 2 πn i against inverse grid scale 1/ s i across modules (Figure 4 B). Moreover, this result can be generalized to any pair of arbitrary current and goal locations on that 1D axis, by replacing the absolute phase p i at the goal location with the phase difference Δp i between grid cell representations of current and goal locations in each module (Equation 3):

A rectangle is formed by hypothetical tangents (red dashed lines) in four directions: superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal to the optical zone. Point O is the geometric center of the rectangle, i.e. the center of the optical zone. In the right panel, the point of the farthest edges of OZ at the temple is located on the Pentacam tangential difference map. The diopter of this point is 0.0D and the coordinates of this point (-2.53 mm, -0.57 mm) are directly shown on the map.

### Breast cancer homologous recombination deficiency prediction from pathological images with a sufficient and representative transformer [^4dcd9377]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

We introduce a RDSA mechanism, inspired by Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3). One fundamental idea behind GPT-3 is sparse self-attention, where attention is restricted to tokens within a relative distance of no more than k. That is, attention is selectively applied to tokens at relative distances of k, 2 k, 3 k, and beyond, while remaining zero for all other tokens. While the concept based on GPT-3 is one-dimensional, pathological images are two-dimensional; hence we analogize the distance (K = k, 2 k, 3 k,.) in 1D context to the radius (R a d = 0 ~ r, r ~ 2 r, 2 r ~ 3 r,. (m − 1) r ~ m r) in 2D context. The illustration of the RDSA mechanism is depicted in Supplementary Fig. 11. The key idea is to reduce the dense attention matrix to a sparse representation by restricting attention computation to a limited subset of query-key (Q K) pairs.

In this paper, we first obtain the attention matrix based on patches from the model, as the [CLS] token does not contain WSI coordinate-related information. Subsequently, we compute the relative distances D between patches within WSIs, as illustrated below:where (x i, y i) represents the coordinate of the i t h patch in the WSI, and m a x (x) denotes the maximum value of the coordinates x among all patches. We first mark the patches within each radius range by:

To implement the patch selection within the radius range, we utilize a randomly initialized unit matrix R within the (0, 1) range to assign a selection probability to the patches within the different radius ranges, as illustrated by S.where ⊗ denotes element-wise operation. Letdenote the k t h largest values of range n in the i t h row, and k is the hyper-parameter. To select the top-k values of S in the different radius ranges R a d, we use the mask operation M (.), which is illustrated as:

We concatenate the { M (n) ; n = 1, 2, …, m } to form M = [M i j]:

After concatenation, the RDSA is defined as follows:

Unbiased stereological sampling—principles and methods note that “Unbiased sampling designs guarantee statistically representative samples and generally must be spatially randomized,” and for anisotropic structures some parameters “require spatial orientation randomization.” Named approaches include “systematic uniform random sampling,” “isotropic uniform random sampling,” “stratified sampling,” “fractionator sampling,” and “proportionator sampling.” Importantly, “Voxel-by-voxel automated image analysis ensures neither accuracy nor precision of the results, nor does it obviate the need to strictly follow stereological sampling principles.”

### Operative guidelines for the reconstruction of the native glenoid plane: an anatomic three-dimensional computed tomography-scan reconstruction study [^d959b6d8]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Reconstruction of the native plane in biconcave eroded glenoids is difficult. Nevertheless, accurate reconstruction of this plane is imperative for successful total shoulder arthroplasty. This study aims to determine guidelines that can increase the accuracy of glenoid component positioning.

Methods

Three different circular planes were determined on 3-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans of 152 healthy shoulders. First, the circular max (CM) plane is formed with the superior tubercle and 2 points, 1 anterior and 1 posterior, at the rim of the inferior third of the glenoid. Second, the circular inferior (CI) plane is formed by 3 points at the inferior 2 quadrants of the glenoid rim. Third, the circular minima (Cm) plane is formed with 3 points situated at the noneroded sector of the anterior glenoid. The angulation of the spinal scapular axis (SSA), the line between the most medial point of the scapular spine and the center of the three different glenoid planes, and the correlation coefficient between the radius of the circle and the length of SSA are calculated.

Results

Angle SSA in the x-axis were 94°, 93°, 93° and in the y-axis were 95°, 111°, and 111° for CM, CI, and Cm, respectively. Correlation coefficient between the radius of the circle and the length of SSA: r = 0.69 for CM, r = 0.75 for CI, and r = 0.75 for Cm.

Conclusion

Three points situated at the native anterior glenoid can reconstruct, within 2° accuracy (95% confidence interval, 1.8°-2.3°), the CI plane. A relationship exists between the radii of the 3 glenoid circles and the width of the scapula (SSA length).

### MMS observations of electron scale magnetic cavity embedded in proton scale magnetic cavity [^fcebc1fd]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

In Fig. 3, data points from four spacecraft and eight energy channels are differentiated by different symbols and colors, detailed in the caption. It is surprising that all data points form a semicircle. A circle that best fits the data points is obtained. The center of the circle is regarded as the center of the ESMC. The radius of the circle (R MC) is 10.0 km, which is approximately eight times the gyro-radius of a thermal electron (ρ e ~1.25 km). The dashed arc represents the segment where observations were not available. The gray region surrounding the solid arc represents an uncertainty (∆ R ∼2.2 km) estimated from Eq. (7), covering 95.9% of the data points.

It is also worth mentioning that the boundary is assumed to be a planar for the application of the sounding technique, while the final result shows that it is a circle. Since the boundary shape is unknown before we get the result, assuming a planar boundary should be the best choice, but it may underestimate the distance for an actual boundary curved outward. Thus, a correction method is proposed (Eqs. (8)–(10)) in the Methods section), which has already been applied to the data points shown in Fig. 3. The underestimation is evaluated to be about 0.47 km based on Eqs. (9) and (10), which is not significant compared with ∆ R, the uncertainty of the sounding result.

The spacecraft trajectories are over-plotted as gray arrowed lines in Fig. 3. It is shown that the trajectory of MMS2 has no intersection with the ESMC, consistent with the absence of any signature in MMS2 observations. Since the radius of the structure is smaller than the gyro-radius of a 4 keV electron, we prefer to use the term electron scale rather than small scale, sub-proton scale, or kinetic-size.

### Pointwise error estimates in localization microscopy [^0dea1e8f]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Covariance-based diffusion estimator

If x k (k =0, 1, …) is the measured trajectory of a freely diffusing particle with diffusion constant D, the widely used model for camera-based tracking by Berglundpredicts that the measured step lengths Δ x k = x k +1 − x k are zero-mean Gaussian variables with covariances given by

and uncorrelated otherwise. Here, 0≤ R ≤1/4 is a blur coefficient that depends on how the images are acquired (for example, R =1/6 for continuous illumination), Δ t is the measurement time-step, and ɛ 2 is the variance of the localization errors.

Substituting sample averages forandand solving for D yields a covariance-based estimator with good performance. If ɛ 2 is known or can be estimated independently, the first relation in equation (7) alone yields a further improved estimate of D. As we argue in Supplementary Note 9, these estimators apply also for variable localization errors if ɛ 2 is replaced by the average.

### Quantum algorithms for topological and geometric analysis of data [^4143d422]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Extracting useful information from large data sets can be a daunting task. Topological methods for analysing data sets provide a powerful technique for extracting such information. Persistent homology is a sophisticated tool for identifying topological features and for determining how such features persist as the data is viewed at different scales. Here we present quantum machine learning algorithms for calculating Betti numbers--the numbers of connected components, holes and voids--in persistent homology, and for finding eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the combinatorial Laplacian. The algorithms provide an exponential speed-up over the best currently known classical algorithms for topological data analysis.

Based on these basic ommatidial metrics, we then calculated the arithmetic mean and SD for each metric across all ommatidia detected within an ROI of an image. This resulted in 16 trait metrics for each image: mean distance to nearest-neighboring ommatidium (nn mean), SD of mean distance to the nearest-neighboring ommatidium (nn SD), mean ommatidial eccentricity (ecc mean), standard deviation of mean ommatidial eccentricity (ecc SD), mean ommatidial area (area mean), standard deviation of mean ommatidial area (area SD), mean ommatidial perimeter (perimeter mean), standard deviation of ommatidial perimeter (perimeter SD), mean of the mean ommatidial radii across an image (radius mean mean), standard deviation of mean ommatidial radius (radius mean SD), mean of all ommatidial radius standard deviation values (radius SD mean), standard deviation of all ommatidial radius standard deviation values (radius SD SD), mean of minimal ommatidial radius values (radius min mean), standard deviation of minimal ommatidial radius values (radius min SD), mean of maximal ommatidial radius values (radius max mean), and standard deviation of maximal ommatidial radius values (radius max SD).

The model did not identify significant heterogeneities in the number of secondary infections by demographic groups (males, females, or children below 16 years of age) or by age group (Fig. 4). However, individuals who lived in less densely populated areas produced a significantly larger number of secondary cases (Fig. 4 c; see Additional File 1 : Section 5.1 for statistical details).

Virtual outbreaks simulated by the branching process well reproduced the spatial and temporal behavior of transmission within the Anzio area. The epidemic curve and the final diameter (defined as the maximum distance between any two cases) of the observed outbreak were closely reproduced by simulated outbreaks (Fig. 5). In particular, the average simulated outbreak diameter was 11.9 km (95%CI, 7.8–17.4), against an observed value of 10.9 km. Notably, if local transmission was not allowed in the simulated outbreaks, the diameter decreased to about one fifth of the observed value (average, 2.2 km; 95%CI, 1.7–3.0, Fig. 5 b), showing the importance of local transmission for epidemic dispersal. This result did not change with different assumptions on underreporting made in the branching process (see Additional File 1 : Section 3).

### Myocardial delineation via registration in a polar coordinate system [^e8408650]. Academic Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of premature death in the western world. Analysis of cardiac function provides clinically useful diagnostic and prognostic information; however, manual analysis of function via delineation is prohibitively time consuming. This article describes a technique for analysis of dynamic magnetic resonance images of the left ventricle using a non-rigid registration algorithm. A manually delineated contour of a single phase was propagated through the dynamic sequence.

Materials and Methods

Short-axis cine magnetic resonance images were resampled into polar coordinates before all the time frames were aligned using a non-rigid registration algorithm. The technique was tested on 10 patient data sets, a total of 1,052 images were analyzed.

Results

Results of this approach were investigated and compared with manual delineation at all phases in the cardiac cycle, and with registration performed in a Cartesian coordinate system. The results correlated very well with manually delineated contours.

Conclusion

A novel approach to the registration and subsequent delineation of cardiac magnetic resonance images has been introduced. For the endocardium, the polar resampling technique correlated well with manual delineation, and better than for images registered without radial resampling in a Cartesian coordinate system. For the epicardium, the difference was not as apparent with both techniques correlating well.

### Geographic disparities in liver supply / demand ratio within fixed-distance and fixed-population circles [^c9362b62]. American Journal of Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Recent OPTN proposals to address geographic disparity in liver allocation have involved circular boundaries: the policy selected 12/17 allocated to 150-mile circles in addition to DSAs/regions, and the policy selected 12/18 allocated to 150-mile circles eliminating DSA/region boundaries. However, methods to reduce geographic disparity remain controversial, within the OPTN and the transplant community. To inform ongoing discussions, we studied center-level supply/demand ratios using SRTR data (07/2013-06/2017) for 27 334 transplanted deceased donor livers and 44 652 incident waitlist candidates. Supply was the number of donors from an allocation unit (DSA or circle), allocated proportionally (by waitlist size) to the centers drawing on these donors. We measured geographic disparity as variance in log-transformed supply/demand ratio, comparing allocation based on DSAs, fixed-distance circles (150- or 400-mile radius), and fixed-population (12- or 50-million) circles. The recently proposed 150-mile radius circles (variance = 0.11, P = .9) or 12-million-population circles (variance = 0.08, P = .1) did not reduce the geographic disparity compared to DSA-based allocation (variance = 0.11). However, geographic disparity decreased substantially to 0.02 in both larger fixed-distance (400-mile, P < .001) and larger fixed-population (50-million, P < .001) circles (P = .9 comparing fixed distance and fixed population). For allocation circles to reduce geographic disparities, they must be larger than a 150-mile radius; additionally, fixed-population circles are not superior to fixed-distance circles.

RESULTS

Simulation

As seen in Figure 2, circular phantoms of diameters of 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16 FOV retained projection appearance on pseudo‐projections at up to 2, 4, 8, and 16 × Δ k y, respectively. In other words, the phantom's projection image started to vanish when the spatial period of the phase‐encoding complex sinusoid approached the phantom size. Smaller objects remained visible when using higher‐order phase encodes, but with the aforementioned cost of diminished signal level.

### Ca-dimers, solvent layering, and dominant electrochemically active species in Ca (BH) in THF [^44eea2a7]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Free-energy sampling was performed with combinations of the following collective variables: the distance between the calcium and the center of mass of the top graphene layer (dZ); the coordination number between the calcium and the boron atom in a given BH 4 (CN(Ca–B), r 0 = 3.8 Å); and, to track dimerization, the distance between two calcium atoms (dCa) or a Ca–Ca coordination number (CN(Ca–Ca), r 0 = 6.5 Å).

Note that the state free-energies in Fig. 1 b were obtained by thermodynamic integration of our 2D free energy surface (Fig. 1 c) over regions delimited by given collective variable values (e.g. for thestate, a Ca–Ca distance larger than 7 Å and a CN(Ca–B) larger than 3.5). Collective variables apply to only one of the calcium atoms, and hence, the free energy is averaged over all (remaining) possible coordination/distances for the other atom. Hence, the room-temperature Boltzmann probability speaks of the likelihood of finding a state formed by the constrained species (e.g.) in the environment of the remaining unconstrained species. Since our system contains two calciums and four borohydrides, the unconstrained space is different depending on the value of the collective variables. In thebasin, the unconstrained Ca can only be fully solvated. On the other hand, in the Ca2+ basin, the other calcium can exist in five different ion coordination states (Ca 2+, Ca(BH 4) +, Ca(BH 4) 2,, and). This is the reason why no symmetry is expected on the free energy surface along the coordination axis, e.g. between CN = 0 and CN = 4 and CN = 1 and CN = 3.

Population sampling

The structures and equilibrium population of points of interest in the free energy surface were collected using Umbrella Sampling. Initial structures were obtained from metadynamics trajectory snapshots at the desired point in the CV space. The collective variable coordinates were restrained with a harmonic potential centered at the desired value, with force constant 1/ w 2 where w is the width of the collective variable grid (see Table S1). Then, trajectories of 150–200 ns were calculated under similar MD parameters as the final equilibration step and MTD run.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^c7aaa471]. Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation structure and mechanisms—computer simulations and experiments in multiple mammalian species suggest that functional reentry is better explained by rotors or spiral waves. The rotor is the organizing center of the reentrant excitation, and as wavefront curvature becomes steeper toward the center the phase singularity (PS) occurs where the velocity becomes zero and the PS follows a circular trajectory. The PS is a unique point where the wavefront and the wavetail converge and velocity is zero, and instead becomes the rotor circling around a small center of unexcited but excitable tissue. Unlike leading-circle reentry, spiral-wave reentry is not determined by the wavelength, but rather by the source–sink relationship between the activation wavefront and the tissue that must be excited in front of it to maintain activity.

### A novel method of quantifying retinal displacement using ultra-widefield fundus autofluorescence imaging [^b9167ecf]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To introduce a novel method of quantifying retinal displacement in three dimensions (3D) using ultra-widefield fundus autofluorescence (UWF-FAF).

Design

Prospective clinical cohort study.

Methods

Patients with primary macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) treated with pneumatic retinopexy (PnR) or vitrectomy were included. Masked graders selected corresponding points on retinal vasculature and retinal vessel printings (RVPs) within Zone 1, a circular region centered on the fovea with a radius extending to the optic disc (OD) center. Two-dimensional (2D) UWF-FAF was projected to 3D using OD and foveal coordinates. Vertical, horizontal, and diagonal distances between corresponding vessel and RVPs were calculated. Vector displacement of the RVPs to vessels were averaged.

Results

A total of 170 retinal vessel-RVP pairs were identified from 54 UWF-FAF images. Mean displacement in Zone 1 was 0.36 ± 0.38 mm, with an absolute mean angle of displacement of 94.93 ± 41.48° and directionality of 191.84 ± 97.39°. Mean Zone 1 displacement was 0.44 ± 0.42mm and 0.21 ± 0.27 mm in vitrectomy (n = 35) and PnR (n = 19) eyes, respectively (P = .041), with no differences in mean angle of displacement/directionality.

Conclusions

A novel method of quantifying the magnitude and direction of retinal displacement is presented, accounting for the spherical 3D curvature of the eye by using corresponding points on retinal vessels and RVPs using UWF-FAF. This provides a 3D vector of displacement agnostic of a singular fixation point such as the optic disc. Accurately quantifying the magnitude and angle/direction of displacement may allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in retinal displacement in various surgical techniques, and a better assessment of the association with functional outcomes.

### Mean-field theory of random close packings of axisymmetric particles [^90ce5be7]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Finding the optimal random packing of non-spherical particles is an open problem with great significance in a broad range of scientific and engineering fields. So far, this search has been performed only empirically on a case-by-case basis, in particular, for shapes like dimers, spherocylinders and ellipsoids of revolution. Here we present a mean-field formalism to estimate the packing density of axisymmetric non-spherical particles. We derive an analytic continuation from the sphere that provides a phase diagram predicting that, for the same coordination number, the density of monodisperse random packings follows the sequence of increasing packing fractions: spheres <oblate ellipsoids <prolate ellipsoids <dimers <spherocylinders. We find the maximal packing densities of 73.1% for spherocylinders and 70.7% for dimers, in good agreement with the largest densities found in simulations. Moreover, we find a packing density of 73.6% for lens-shaped particles, representing the densest random packing of the axisymmetric objects studied so far.

### Nonlocal flat optics for size-selective image processing and denoising [^99df2c9c]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Results

Design principles and simulation results

In the spatial frequency domain (k -space), the input electric field E in (x, y) is represented by its Fourier transform,, where x and y denote spatial coordinates, k x and k y represent the wavevector. Consequently, the light field is modulated by a wavevector-dependent OTF, with spatial frequency in k -space denoted as k r / k 0. Following Fourier optics, the target in k -space encompasses spatial frequencies ranging from low to high, and their relationship with the input electric field follows a sinc function. In particular, the radius ∆ r of the low-frequency region depends on the location of the first zero point of the sinc function:, where ∆ x and ∆ y represent the size of the input in the x - and y -coordinate, and A is a system-specific constant. This analysis establishes a constant spatial frequency range for a given system. As the size of the input target (∆ x or ∆ y) decreases in real space, the low-frequency radius in k -space expands, leading to a reduction in the high-frequency ratio, and vice versa. Further details, including the effects of noise and object positioning on the k -space distribution, are provided in SI Note 1. This property leads to distinct frequency distributions corresponding to different input sizes. Therefore, selecting an appropriate band-pass OTF that modulates and filters the information around the high- and low-frequency peaks facilitates size-selective image processing. Illustrated in Fig. 1, we analyze an ideal rectangular band-pass OTF denoted as H (k r), which can be expressed as:where NA 1,2 denotes the numerical apertures for which the rectangular function induces a step change. Specifically, the range NA 1 to NA 2 corresponds to the transmitted frequency information, while the rest needs to be partially filtered for size-selective image processing.

### R.E.N.A.L. (radius, exophytic / endophytic, nearness to collecting system or sinus, anterior / posterior, and location relative to polar lines) nephrometry score predicts early tumor recurrence and complications after percutaneous ablative therapies for renal cell carcinoma: a 5-year experience [^9e17c19b]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the prognostic value of R.E.N.A.L. (radius, exophytic/endophytic, nearness to collecting system or sinus, anterior/posterior, and location relative to polar lines) nephrometry score after percutaneous ablation of renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

Materials and Methods

A retrospective 5-year study was performed. Participants were 87 consecutive patients (median age, 67.1 y; 59.7% male, 40.3% female) with 101 biopsy-proven RCCs who underwent percutaneous ablation (54.0% cryoablation, 46.0% radiofrequency ablation). Follow-up computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was performed in all cases (mean follow-up, 34.6 mo ± 23.5). R.E.N.A.L. scores were analyzed to determine the association of the score with treatment outcomes and complications.

Results

All tumors corresponded to stage 1A disease. Mean tumor size was 2.05 cm (range, 0.7-3.9 cm), and 50.5% of the lesions measured > 2 cm. Nephrometry score was > 8 in 31.4% of lesions. Overall recurrence rate was 16.8%, first-year recurrence rate was 7.9%, and complication rate was 9.9%. A nephrometry score > 8 was associated with increased complications after percutaneous ablation (P < .0001), increased overall recurrence (P < .0001), and increased risk of first-year recurrence (P < .0001). Immediate complications were associated with tumor size > 2 cm (P < .0001) and risk of local recurrence (P < .001). Age, gender, and percutaneous ablation technique were not correlated with recurrence or immediate complications. Patients undergoing cryoablation had a higher nephrometry score with no significant differences in recurrence rate compared with RF ablation (P = .199).

Conclusions

A R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score ≥ 8 predicts recurrence and complications after percutaneous renal ablation.

### Iso-acoustic focusing of cells for size-insensitive acousto-mechanical phenotyping [^fa741f6b]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Measuring the acoustic field

To measure the shape of the local acoustic field along a 1 mm segment of the IAF channel, fluorescent polystyrene microbeads (radius 2.23 μm) were investigated using micro particle image velocimetry (PIV). Particles were suspended in 10 % iodixanol (homogeneous) and injected in the IAF channel and the flow was stopped before turning on the acoustic field for a transducer voltage of 3.5 V. Image sequences were acquired at 4 Hz capturing the motion of the microbeads in the acoustic field and commercial PIV software (Dynamic studio, Dantec Dynamics, Denmark) was used to extract velocity information from the images (Supplementary Fig. 1a) using the method of adaptive correlation. The y -components (transverse to the channel) of the velocity vectors from 5 consecutive frames for three repeated acoustic actuation experiments are plotted in Supplementary Fig. 1b. Data was fitted (black dashed line) to the expression u rad = u 0 + ∂ t y following Eq. (12) in Supplementary Note 3, using u 0, E ac and k y as fitting parameters for a spherical polystyrene particle of radius 2.23 μm, density 1050, kg m −3 and compressibility 1.65 × 10 −10 Pa −1. Medium properties for 10% iodixanol (Supplementary Fig. 2) were used to calculate that the acoustic contrast factor Φ=0.199. The fit resulted in u 0 =−3.557 × 10 −7 m s −1 (CI 95 : −8.014 × 10 −7, 9.004 × 10 −8), E ac =16.27 J m −3 (CI 95 : 16.16, 16.39), and k y =8315, m −1 (CI 95 : 8293, 8336). The fitted acoustic wave vector k y corresponds to a sound wavelength λ=2π/ k y =756 μm which is indicative of a half wavelength resonance in the 375 μm wide IAF channel. The fitted local acoustic energy density at 3.5 V actuation corresponds to a local pressure amplitude within the field of view of p a =0.39 MPa.

### Coarse-grained fundamental forms for characterizing isometries of trapezoid-based origami metamaterials [^3b803fbe]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We similarly coarse-grain the infinitesimal deformation of the periodic origami tessellation generated from a homogeneous isometry by averaging the corresponding lattice displacement (Δ μ) and lattice angular velocity (L μ) over all primitive unit cells. We again do this in two steps. First, we average the lattice displacement and lattice angular velocity over the same set of standard unit cells used to computeabove. Here, there are an additional four copies of each standard cell distinguished by the orientation of the frame for each of the four corners that meet at the vertex set at the origin. We denote the resultsand. Second, we expand Eqns. ((17), (18)) in terms of these quantities:Again, the partial derivatives satisfy δ ∂ μ t ν = δ ∂ ν t μ and we transform from the discrete cell indices to the continuous surface coordinates via the Jacobian. While we do not compute an embedding directly, this procedure is sufficient to compute the fundamental forms and characterize the geometry of the origami tessellations. These methods extend to the crease patterns shown in Fig. 1 C, D that are not periodic in the azimuthal direction but are still composed of cellular building blocks by performing the first step of our averaging between analogous, but nonequivalent, vertices in both the forward and backwards directions.

### Detecting the ultra low dimensionality of real networks [^72f4c17c]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Dimensionality is a key concept in the project of understanding the geometrical structure of reality. In recent years, the quest to identify dimensionality has reached computer science and network science where, sustained by phenomena of measure concentration, complex data and interactions only populate a small subspace of their original high-dimensional space. The method we present here does not need any a priori spatial embedding and infers the dimensionality of a graph by exploiting the fact that the densities of edge cycles in its topology carry information about its dimensionality. Our results not only prove that complex networks populate a reduced region of a high-dimensional space but also that they are well represented in hyperbolic geometry with ultra low dimensionality.

This claim is valid for complex networks that are simultaneously sparse, small-world, and highly clustered, and possibly—but not necessarily—with heterogeneous degree distributions. Even if a real network is naturally embedded in Euclidean space, this minimal set of complex features ensures that our methodology is applicable, meaning that explicit Euclidean distances in those systems are not the only factor that determines connectivity in the network and other features may have a role as well. At the same time, our formalism is also valid for geometric random graphs, which are very homogeneous and clustered and non small world networks, which happen in our model when γ > 3 and β > 2 D. This means that graphs in this region of the parameter space are effectively described by the geometry of the D -sphere, which becomes the Euclidean space in the thermodynamic limit, rather than by hyperbolic geometry. Finally, links in D -dimensional lattices are strongly correlated whereas in our model links are statistical independent. D -dimensional lattices are, thus, not suited to being described by our hyperbolic multidimensional model.

### Automatic correspondence on medical images: a comparative study of four methods for allocating corresponding points [^db565d3a]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2010). Low credibility.

The accurate estimation of point correspondences is often required in a wide variety of medical image-processing applications. Numerous point correspondence methods have been proposed in this field, each exhibiting its own characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. This paper presents a comprehensive comparison of four automatic methods for allocating corresponding points, namely the template-matching technique, the iterative closest points approach, the correspondence by sensitivity to movement scheme, and the self-organizing maps algorithm. Initially, the four correspondence methods are described focusing on their distinct characteristics and their parameter selection for common comparisons. The performance of the four methods is then qualitatively and quantitatively compared over a total of 132 two-dimensional image pairs divided into eight sets. The sets comprise of pairs of images obtained using controlled geometry protocols (affine and sinusoidal transforms) and pairs of images subject to unknown transformations. The four methods are statistically evaluated pairwise on all image pairs and individually in terms of specific features of merit based on the correspondence accuracy as well as the registration accuracy. After assessing these evaluation criteria for each method, it was deduced that the self-organizing maps approach outperformed in most cases the other three methods in comparison.

### Dense mode clustering in brain maps [^46f67f9e]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2007). Low credibility.

A mode-based clustering method is developed for identifying spatially dense clusters in brain maps. This type of clustering focuses on identifying clusters in brain maps independent of their shape or overall variance. This can be useful for both localization in terms of interpretation and for subsequent graphical analysis that might require more coherent or dense regions of interest as starting points. The method automatically does signal/noise sharpening through density mode seeking. We also discuss the problem of parameter selection with this method and propose a new method involving 2-parameter control surface, in which we show that the same cluster solution results from tradeoff of these 2 parameters (the local density k and the radius r of the spherical kernel). We benchmark the new dense mode clustering by using several artificially created data sets and brain imaging data sets from an event perception task by perturbing the data set with noise and measuring three kinds of deviation from the original cluster solution. We present benchmark results that demonstrate that the mode clustering method consistently outperforms the commonly used single-linkage clustering, k means method (centroid method) and Ward's method (variance method).

### Using rigid motion constraints for the registration of free-form surfaces [^eaadaff5]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2001). Low credibility.

We present a new method for registration of freeform surfaces based on the iterative closest point (ICP) method and on geometric properties of reflected correspondence vectors. The method is based on computing relative gaps between reflected correspondences and between the projections of reflected correspondences along the rotation axis and using these to eliminate false matches. Experimental results on synthetic data and on real range images demonstrate that the method is robust and accurate for image registration with small motions.

### Multi-scale turbulence simulation suggesting improvement of electron heated plasma confinement [^2aa26b9e]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Time evolution of the perturbed distribution functions f s of plasma species s, the electrostatic potential ϕ, and the magnetic vector potential parallel to the equilibrium magnetic field A || is solved based on the delta- f gyrokinetic Vlasov–Poisson–Ampère equations. The configuration space is represented by field-aligned coordinates x = r − r 0, y = [q (r) θ − ζ] r 0 / q (r 0), z = θ, where r, θ, and ζ are the tokamak minor radius, and the poloidal and toroidal angles, respectively. The velocity–space coordinates are the parallel velocity v || and magnetic moment μ. The local flux-tube modelresolves perturbed quantities in a long and thin simulation box along a field line, whereas the equilibrium quantities are approximated at the flux-tube centre r = r 0, consistent with delta- f gyrokinetic ordering. Then, periodicities in perpendicular directions x and y are assumed along with homogeneous turbulence in fluids. The last boundary condition is the torus periodicity f (r, θ + 2π, ζ, v ||, μ) = f (r, θ, ζ, v ||, μ). In this study, the equilibrium magnetic field is assumed to have a concentric circular torus geometry (the so-called s-α model with geometric α = 0), which is characterised by the tokamak inverse aspect ratio ε r, safety factor q, and magnetic shear ŝ. We selected ε r = 0.18, q = 1.42 and ŝ = 0.8. The following plasma species were included in simulations: electron, deuterium, tritium, and helium (s = e, D, T, and He). The employed plasma parameters are e = e D = e T = − e e = e He /2, m i = 1837 m e = m D /2 = m T /3 = m He /4, T i = T D = T T = T He, n D = n T = 0.45 n e, n He = 0.05 n e, R 0 /L n e = R 0 /L n D = R 0 /L n T = R 0 /L n He = 3, R 0 /L T e = 9.342 and R 0 /L T D = R 0 /L T T = R 0 /L T He = 1, where L n s = − den n s / dx and L T s = − den T s / dx are the density and temperature gradient scale lengths. The elementary electric charge e, hydrogen mass m i, and tokamak major radius R 0 are used as references. The charge density satisfies the quasi-neutrality condition ∑ s e s n s = 0 and ∑ s e s n s / L n s = 0. The plasma beta value is β = μ 0 n e T D / B 0 2 = 0.05%, normalised Debye length is λ 2 = ε 0 B 0 2 /(m i n e) = 10 −3 and normalised collision frequency is ν * = qR 0 τ ee −1 /(√2 ε r 3/2 v te) = 0.05 with electron–electron collision time τ ee. The above plasma parameters are chosen from a previous studybut the number of plasma species is increased. Most parameters are comparable to the existing tokamak device (e.g. a high T e discharge of DIII-D #173147), whereas the electron temperature and its gradient are slightly enhanced to mimic the electron-heated burning fusion plasma. Although electron heating by the alpha particles is the main heat source in the burning plasma, the ion–electron energy exchange process also heats ion species. When the ITG increases due to the energy exchange, the ITG modes are destabilised. For the multi-scale ITG/ETG turbulence at T e = T i and R 0 / L T e = R 0 / L T i, detailed mechanisms of cross-scale interactions between ITG and ETG modes have been reported previously,. In this study, we focus on the parameter regime at T e > T i and R 0 / L T e > R 0 / L T i which has not yet been analysed in existing devices. We examined the electron temperature dependence in the range 1 ≤ T e / T i ≤ 4, and detailed analyses are presented for the case of T e / T i = 3, where ETG turbulence significantly affects near-marginal TEMs. These parameters are also related to the electron-heated plasma at the PFPO-1 phase in the ITER research plan which is an important step for early success of ITER. The prediction of the integrated modelling of PFPO-1 phase H -mode plasma reported high central temperature ratio T e / T i > 3 and R 0 / L T e > R 0 / L T i. For the multi-scale turbulence simulations, we employed simulation box sizes 0 ≤ x/ρ ti < 125, 0 ≤ y/ρ ti < 40π,–π ≤ z < π,−4.5 ≤ v || / v ts ≤ 4.5, 0 ≤ μB 0 / T s ≤ 12.5, and grid points in each dimension (N x, N y, N z, N v||, N μ) = (2048, 2048, 40, 64, 16) for the T e / T i = 1 case and (N x, N y, N z, N v||, N μ) = (1024, 1024, 40, 64, 16) for the 2 ≤ T e / T i cases. Since the GKV code treats perpendicular x and y space using the Fourier spectral method with 2/3 de-aliasing rule, f (x, y, z, v ||, μ) = ∑ kx ∑ ky f k (z, v ||, μ) exp(i k x x + i k y y), the corresponding perpendicular wavenumber resolutions are k x,min = k y,min = 0.05 ρ ti −1, k x,max = k y,max = 33.9 ρ ti −1 for the T e / T i = 1 case and k x,max = k y,max = 16.95 ρ ti −1 for the 2 ≤ T e / T i cases. For single ion-scale turbulence simulations, we employed reduced perpendicular wavenumber space k x,max = 4 ρ ti −1, k y,max = 1 ρ ti −1, which well resolves large ion-scale micro-instabilities and associated turbulence but excludes small electron-scale dynamics. Further, for single electron-scale turbulence simulations, we employed smaller perpendicular box sizes k x,min = k y,min = 0.5 ρ ti −1, which covers only electron-scale micro-instabilities but excludes ion-scale ones.

The shift of the RFs (lines, RF contours; dots, RF centers; dva, degrees of visual angle) for an example recording (right panel). b In two-phase recordings, noise correlations decrease with the RF-center distance in both superficial (crimson) and deep (green) layers (dots - data points, lines - linear regression, superficial layers n = 2544 MU pairs; deep layers n = 3064 MU pairs). Orange background highlights the range of short lateral distances within single or nearby columns. Purple background highlights longer lateral distances between distant columns, such as distances covered by a Utah array, which are outside the range of our laminar recordings. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean (SEM). c Same as b for one-phase recordings. Noise correlations do not decrease with the RF-center distance (superficial layers n = 920 MU pairs; deep layers n = 1448 MU pairs). d Our theory predicts that noise correlations decay with lateral distance exponentially, with the decay constant L called correlation length. Simulations of the full dynamical-system network (circles) agree with the analytical formula derived using the binary-unit network approximation (line). The model parameters α 1, α 2, r on, and r off are sampled from a distribution of parameters in HMMs fitted to the data. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

### Quantitative mappings between symmetry and topology in solids [^ce1ff365]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The study of spatial symmetries was accomplished during the last century and had greatly improved our understanding of the properties of solids. Nowadays, the symmetry data of any crystal can be readily extracted from standard first-principles calculation. On the other hand, the topological data (topological invariants), the defining quantities of nontrivial topological states, are in general considerably difficult to obtain, and this difficulty has critically slowed down the search for topological materials. Here we provide explicit and exhaustive mappings from symmetry data to topological data for arbitrary gapped band structure in the presence of time-reversal symmetry and any one of the 230 space groups. The mappings are completed using the theoretical tools of layer construction and symmetry-based indicators. With these results, finding topological invariants in any given gapped band structure reduces to a simple search in the mapping tables provided.

### The effect of orthokeratology treatment zone decentration on myopia progression [^a942ab7e]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Determination of treatment zone decentration

A Corneal Topographer (Medmont E300) was used to collect the corneal surface data from the subjects and the tangential power map of corneal topography after 1 month of Ortho-K lens wear was used for analysis. An in-house developed computer program (Python) was used to measure the distance of the Ortho-K lens decentration. The data on the tangential radius of curvature and its coordinates were obtained from a Medmont Topographer. Then, the data on the tangential radius of curvature were converted into data on the tangential diopter, and the noise points generated during the acquisition process were removed by mean filtering. The sets of all maximum points in each direction (300 directions) of the tangential diopter were clustered with the K-means algorithm, and all the points in the decentered zone were identified. The data points obtained with the K-means algorithm were fitted to obtain a fitted ellipse. The distance between the center of the ellipse and the center of the pupil was defined as the decentration distance, and the severity of decentration was classified based on the decentration distance. Figure 1 shows the corneal topography data 1 month after Ortho-K lens wear. The red circle indicates the treatment zone of the Ortho-K lens. An ellipse was fitted on top of the treatment zone and the center of the ellipse was defined as the center of the treatment zone. The black line represents the decentration distance between the pupil center and the center of the fitted ellipses.

Fig. 1 
A computer program developed in-house was adopted to measure the distance of ortho-K lens decentration for each subject. The blue ellipse was considered to be the fitting ellipse. The black line represents the decentration distance between the pupil center and the center of the fitted ellipse

The definition of the magnitude of the treatment zone decentration proposed by Tsai and Lin was used in this study. The subjects were divided into three groups based on the decentration distance: mildly decentered group (decentration distance <0.5 mm), moderately decentered group (decentration distance >0.5 mm and <1.0 mm), and severely decentered group (decentration distance >1.0 mm).

### Killing by type VI secretion drives genetic phase separation and correlates with increased cooperation [^4111132d]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

To calculate the structure factor, S(q), we start with an image from a simulation or experiment, I(x,y). S(qx,qy) is the absolute value of the Fourier Transform of I(x,y), squared, where q x and q y are spatial frequencies in the x- and y- directions, respectively. We then radially average S(q x,q y),.

To calculate the assortment (r) of the genotype over interaction radius h, we again start out with a binarized image from a simulation or experiment I(x,y) in which we set values of the focal strain g to 1 and the competitor strain c to −1. We first convolved I(x,y) with a kernel in which all positions other than the center were set to 1, and the center set to −((2 h+1) 2 −1), generating the transformed matrix C(x,y). For example, the kernel for distance h of 1 would be. Edges within distance h were trimmed. For each interaction radius h (which ranged from 1–36), we calculated the assortment r of the focal strain g as r g =. r is thus the mean frequency of g within interaction radius h, relative to frequency of g in the population as a whole. r, which ranges from −1 to 1, describes the spatial association of each genotype above or below what would be expected from random associations (r =0). This definition of assortment is commonly used in social evolution studies, and is conceptually analogous to Hamiltonian relatedness. Similarly, we calculated the assortment of the competitor strain c as r c =.

### A critical edge number revealed for phase stabilities of two-dimensional ball-stick polygons [^90bdda77]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Determinations of phases and phase transitions

The bond-orientational order parameter is defined asand, where N is the total number of unit-cell, i runs over all the representative points of the unit-cells while j runs over the n nearest neighbors of point i, < > means taking the ensemble average. For triangle, the representative points of the unit-cells are chosen as the COMs of molecules with the same initial body-orientation, and since we study the non-equilibrium dynamical process,is calculated for each snapshot instead of taking the ensemble average; for the other four polygons, they are chosen as the COMs of all molecules. The characterizations of the spin-ice-like state of the triangular system and the distorted lattice of the square system have been described in the main text, and it is worth emphasizing that the Delaunay tessellation/Voronoi diagram in Fig. 5c is calculated by the freud librarywith periodic boundary condition. Below we focus on the identifications of the crystal, hexatic, and liquid states. The liquid state has an approximately zero bond-orientational order parameter, the hexatic state has an exponentially decaying translational correlation function as well as a non-zero bond-orientational order parameter, and the crystal state has an algebraically decaying translational correlation function as well as a non-zero bond-orientational order parameter. The bond-orientational order parameter was calculated by the analysis tool in LAMMPS.

The calculation of the translational correlation function is a key point for the phase determination of 2D melting. In 2011, the pioneer work by Bernard and Krauth provided a method to evaluate the correlation function, which was later modified by Li and Ciamarra for the L-J systems. The correlation function is defined as, where θ is the orientation of the crystal axis and should be determined by scanningat a fixed r (the first peak value corresponding to the orientation of the crystal axis).

Basically, a first-order phase transition can be identified by the discontinuous change in the caloric and density curves. We also confirm the discontinuous transitions by the corresponding order-parameters: body-orientational order parameter for solid-solid transition and bond-orientational order parameter for solid-liquid or hexatic-liquid transition.

### Using grid cells for navigation [^fac508c8]. Neuron (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

We have described an algorithmic solution to the computational problem of large-scale vector navigation with grid cells. That is, how to accurately compute translation vectors between arbitrary locations in large-scale 2D space using the grid cell representations of those locations. This problem is the inverse of that thought to be performed by grid cells during path integration—extracting the translation vector between current and goal locations, as opposed to combining a previously known location with a subsequent movement vector to estimate the current location. Specifically, we have shown how the spatial phases of activity in grid cell modules of different spatial scales at start and goal locations can be used to extract the distance and direction between those locations. This is achieved by finding the maximum slope of a plane that fits the family of points defined by the phase difference in each grid module and the inverse scale of that module on at least two non-collinear axes (Figure 4 C). Importantly, this solution is robust to differences in grid orientation between grid modules and ellipticity (i.e. differences in scale between axes) within each grid module. This solution relates to the Fourier shift theorem, whereby the 2D translation applied to a basis set of Fourier components can be recovered from the phase changes across components.

We have also described several neural network implementations of this algorithmic solution, building on a large body of previous work that has explored how grid cells efficiently encode location and might contribute to vector navigation. These models assume only that the grid representations of current and goal locations are known and produce direct vectors between those locations that may traverse previously unknown terrain. Each proposed implementation can decode 2D translation vectors with an accuracy and range that is comparable to the theoretical capacity of the grid cell system, and each model offers specific strengths, weaknesses, and experimental predictions. Several computational implementations that make use of the Chinese Remainder Theorem to perform this conversion have previously been proposed. These models have limitations, however, such as requiring a hard-wired energy landscape or readout weights, producing linear outputs that are only correct modulo the lowest common multiple of grid scales or performing gradient descent on an energy landscape with multiple local minima.

### Rapid prediction of molecular crystal structures using simple topological and physical descriptors [^fcbaa22a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Organic molecular crystals constitute a class of materials of critical importance in numerous industries. Despite the ubiquity of these systems, our ability to predict molecular crystal structures starting only from a two-dimensional diagram of the constituent compound(s) remains a significant challenge. Most structure-prediction protocols require a customized interatomic interaction model on which the quality of the results can depend sensitively. To overcome this problem, we introduce a new topological approach to molecular crystal structure prediction. The approach posits that in a stable structure, molecules are oriented such that principal axes and normal ring plane vectors are aligned with specific crystallographic directions and that heavy atoms occupy positions that correspond to minima of a set of geometric order parameters. By minimizing an objective function that encodes these orientations and atomic positions, and filtering based on the vdW free volume and intermolecular close contact distributions derived from the Cambridge Structural Database, stable structures and polymorphs for a given crystal can be predicted entirely mathematically without reliance on an interaction model.

### A topological fluctuation theorem [^888dd8d2]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

A detailed examination of this probability distribution reveals that it is strongly non-Gaussian. Indeed, for positive winding numbers p (n, t ∣ r 0) is asymptotically scale free: p (n, t ∣ r 0) n −3/2 (see Fig. 2 a), while, as a consequence of the fluctuation theorem (3), it decays exponentially as n → − ∞. This difference in scaling behaviors results in a strong asymmetry of the overall distribution between the positive and negative winding number sectors (see Fig. 2 b).

a The exact winding number distribution for a free vortex exhibits a power law scaling for large positive n values. b At all times t and initial radial position r 0, the ratio of negative to positive winding number distributions maps onto the theoretical prediction (3) (inset) resulting in an exponential scaling of p (n, t ∣ r 0) for large negative windings (caption in panel a). c In the presence of boundaries restricting the particle motion with diffusivity D inside a disk of radius R and outside the vortex center, the winding angle distribution shows exponential tails at small times (red curve, D t / R 2 = 0.1), while it becomes Gaussian for larger t (blue curve, D t / R 2 = 10). The theorem holds irrespectively of the shape of the distribution (inset, the orange curve corresponds to D t / R 2 = 1). d, e Representative trajectories corresponding to cases II and III discussed in the text. f The probability ratio (14) averaged over initial positions r 0 and trajectory times t as function of the total winding angle Δ ϕ for the three cases (case I corresponding to isotropic confinement) discussed in the text and Δ r = Δ z = 0. In a, b γ = 2 π, while in c – e γ = 0.1 × 2 π. In d – f we used k B T / k = 10, while for case II (resp. III) α = 0.5(1) and x c = 0(4).

### Identification of phases, symmetries and defects through local crystallography [^5fabe4e7]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Advances in electron and probe microscopies allow 10pm or higher precision in measurements of atomic positions. This level of fidelity is sufficient to correlate the length (and hence energy) of bonds, as well as bond angles to functional properties of materials. Traditionally, this relied on mapping locally measured parameters to macroscopic variables, for example, average unit cell. This description effectively ignores the information contained in the microscopic degrees of freedom available in a high-resolution image. Here we introduce an approach for local analysis of material structure based on statistical analysis of individual atomic neighbourhoods. Clustering and multivariate algorithms such as principal component analysis explore the connectivity of lattice and bond structure, as well as identify minute structural distortions, thus allowing for chemical description and identification of phases. This analysis lays the framework for building image genomes and structure-property libraries, based on conjoining structural and spectral realms through local atomic behaviour.

### A growing bacterial colony in two dimensions as an active nematic [^27ea9d5e]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

‘Hubble’ expansion

We found no coherent azimuthal movement of cells, but there is a coherent radial movement, whose speed increases linearly with distance from the centroid, Fig. 2b, reminiscent of the Hubble expansion of the universe. Consider the velocity field, v, of this growth-induced motion: we now write an equation for this quantity based on our experimental observations. Mass conservation requires that the cell density, ρ, satisfieswhere Λ is the growth rate, and D t = ∂ t + v · ∇ is the material derivative. Assuming incompressibility (we relax this assumption below), i.e. D t ρ = 0, we findwhere hereafter repeated suffices are summed. Since Λ is independent of space in our colonies, and there is no coherent azimuthal movement, Eq. (2) predicts the radial component to be v r = Λ r /2 ≡ Hr, as observed, Fig. 2b (the factor 1/2 arises as the system is 2 D).

A linear fit to the population-averaged data in Fig. 2b gives our ‘Hubble constant’ H = 0.007 min −1. Theoretically, H = 0.5Λ, while individual values of (H, Λ) obtained from each of the 32 colonies, Fig. 2c, are consistent with a linear scaling of H with Λ and are fitted by H = 0.4Λ (the correlation between H and Λ is r ~ 0.77, corresponding to a p -value p < 0.00001). The discrepancy from the theoretical prediction H = 0.5Λ may arise either from small systematic errors in the fitting (e.g. due to small drift close to colony centroids) or from the approximations in the theoretical argument, such as that of isotropic growth. The scatter in the data in Fig. 2c gives an indication of the extent of intrinsic noise in our population of colonies.

Note that the expansive ‘Hubble flow’ we observe is distinct from the spontaneous shear flow exhibited by number-conserving active nematics,.

Results

This study included 60 eyes from 53 participants who were on average 76 ± 7 years (range, 52–87 years) and 31 (62%) participants were female. The median total GA area of these eyes at baseline was 3.81 mm 2 (interquartile range [IQR], 2.39–9.37 mm 2) or 1.95 mm (IQR, 1.54–3.06 mm) for square-root GA area. The median percentage of GA in the central 8° radius region sampled by DMP testing was 20% (IQR, 13%–43%). These eyes were seen across a median of 5 visits (IQR, 4 to 7 visits), over a median follow-up of 15 months (IQR, 12–20 months; 85% of eyes had a follow-up duration of ≥12 months). The median rate of GA growth was 1.93 mm 2 /year (IQR, 1.06–3.66 mm 2 /year) or 0.40 mm/year (IQR, 0.27–0.63 mm/year) for square-root GA area.
