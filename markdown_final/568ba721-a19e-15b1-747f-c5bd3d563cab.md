## Question

Which are beta lactam antibiotics?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotics are beta-lactam antibiotics. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the defining chemical structure that makes an antibiotic a beta-lactam. Then, I should verify the major classes that share this core. Next, I will enumerate representative agents within each class, being careful to distinguish older from newer agents. After that, I should confirm the mechanism of action and why this matters for resistance. Finally, I will consider special cases like beta-lactamase inhibitors and briefly note clinical implications that often accompany this question, while keeping the focus on classification and examples.

> Let me first confirm the core definition. Beta-lactam antibiotics are characterized by a four-membered beta-lactam ring; this cyclic amide is the pharmacophore that confers their mechanism of action and susceptibility to beta-lactamase–mediated inactivation, which is why the class is defined by this structural feature rather than by spectrum or clinical use alone [^0f644671] [^dac6751b].

> I will now examine the four principal families. Wait, let me verify the canonical grouping: penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and monobactams are consistently cited as the major beta-lactam classes, reflecting shared core chemistry with differences in side chains and ring systems that modulate spectrum and stability [^0f644671] [^0ba05e72].

> Next, I should review penicillins. Natural penicillins include penicillin G and penicillin V; aminopenicillins include amoxicillin and ampicillin; penicillinase-resistant agents include methicillin, nafcillin, oxacillin, dicloxacillin, and flucloxacillin; and extended-spectrum penicillins include piperacillin and ticarcillin, with piperacillin commonly paired with tazobactam to overcome some beta-lactamases [^0ba05e72] [^3f8d0c32].

> Hold on, I should verify cephalosporins by generation. First-generation agents include cefazolin, cephalexin, and cefadroxil; second-generation include cefuroxime, cefoxitin, and cefaclor; third-generation include ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefpodoxime; fourth-generation include cefepime; and fifth-generation include ceftaroline and ceftobiprole, with newer combinations like ceftolozane–tazobactam and ceftazidime–avibactam extending activity against resistant Gram-negatives [^0ba05e72] [^3f8d0c32].

> Let me consider carbapenems. I need to ensure I list the clinically used agents: imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, and doripenem are the established carbapenems, prized for broad-spectrum activity including many multidrug-resistant Gram-negative organisms, though resistance via carbapenemases is a growing concern [^0c093611] [^0f644671].

> I should confirm monobactams. Aztreonam is the prototypical monobactam with a monocyclic beta-lactam structure and is notable for minimal cross-reactivity with penicillins, making it a useful alternative in patients with IgE-mediated penicillin allergy when chosen thoughtfully [^0ba05e72] [^cdb51c77].

> But wait, what about beta-lactamase inhibitors. I initially thought to include clavulanate, tazobactam, avibactam, vaborbactam, and relebactam as beta-lactams themselves; hold on, I should verify and correct that. These are inhibitors that lack standalone antibacterial activity and are co-formulated with beta-lactams to protect them from enzymatic inactivation; they are not themselves beta-lactam antibiotics, even though some like tazobactam contain a beta-lactam ring, so they should not be listed among the antibiotics in this classification exercise [^3f8d0c32] [^a58498ae].

> Next, I should review the mechanism to anchor why this classification matters. Beta-lactams inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis by acylating penicillin-binding proteins, thereby disrupting cell wall cross-linking; this time-dependent bactericidal effect underpins dosing strategies that prioritize maintaining free drug concentrations above the MIC for a sufficient portion of the dosing interval, which becomes clinically relevant in critical illness and in the face of resistance [^0f644671] [^094520ec].

> I need to ensure I acknowledge resistance mechanisms that intersect with this taxonomy. The clinical utility of beta-lactams is threatened by beta-lactamases that hydrolyze the beta-lactam ring, including serine beta-lactamases and metallo-beta-lactamases; this is why inhibitor combinations and carbapenems are strategically used, and why emerging carbapenemase producers pose a global threat that shapes empiric therapy choices [^0f644671] [^a3e8fe5c].

> Let me reconsider whether any other agents qualify. Some clinicians ask about eravacycline or other tetracyclines; I should double-check and confirm that these lack a beta-lactam ring and are not part of this class, reinforcing that the unifying feature here is the presence of the beta-lactam nucleus rather than overlapping clinical indications [^notfound].

> In summary, beta-lactam antibiotics are those containing a beta-lactam ring and belong to four families: penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and monobactams, with representative agents including penicillin G, amoxicillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, meropenem, and aztreonam; beta-lactamase inhibitors are adjuncts, not antibiotics themselves, and the class's clinical performance is shaped by time-dependent killing and evolving resistance via beta-lactamases [^0f644671] [^0ba05e72] [^3f8d0c32].

Beta-lactam antibiotics are a class of antibiotics defined by a **four-membered β-lactam ring** [^0f644671] and include **penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and monobactams** [^0ba05e72]. They work by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis via penicillin-binding proteins, leading to cell lysis and death [^0f644671]. Resistance commonly arises from **β-lactamase enzymes** [^a58498ae] that inactivate the β-lactam ring; inhibitors (clavulanate, tazobactam, avibactam, vaborbactam) are often combined with β-lactams to restore activity [^3f8d0c32]. β-lactams are widely used for many infections but require attention to allergy cross-reactivity [^48f1d29d] and resistance patterns [^a3e8fe5c].

## Classification of beta-lactam antibiotics

Beta-lactam antibiotics are classified into **four main groups** based on their core structure and spectrum of activity:

| **Group** | **Examples** | **Key features** |
|-|-|-|
| Penicillins | - Penicillin G <br/> - Amoxicillin <br/> - Piperacillin <br/> - Oxacillin | - Narrow to broad spectrum <br/> - Susceptible to β-lactamases [^0f644671] |
| Cephalosporins | - Cefazolin <br/> - Ceftriaxone <br/> - Cefepime <br/> - Ceftaroline | - Organized by generations (1st–5th) <br/> - Increasing Gram-negative coverage [^0ba05e72] |
| Carbapenems | - Imipenem <br/> - Meropenem <br/> - Ertapenem <br/> - Doripenem | - Broadest spectrum <br/> - Stable against most β-lactamases [^0c093611] |
| Monobactams | - Aztreonam | - Narrow Gram-negative spectrum <br/> - Minimal cross-allergenicity [^cdb51c77] |

---

## Mechanism of action

Beta-lactams inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to **penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)** [^0f644671], which are essential for peptidoglycan cross-linking. This disrupts cell wall integrity, leading to cell lysis and death [^dac6751b].

---

## Resistance mechanisms

Bacterial resistance to beta-lactams occurs via **three main mechanisms**:

- **Β-lactamase production**: Enzymes (e.g. ESBLs, AmpC, carbapenemases) hydrolyze the β-lactam ring, inactivating the antibiotic [^a58498ae].
- **Altered PBPs**: Mutations reduce drug binding (e.g. MRSA) [^ab0162bc].
- **Efflux pumps and porin changes**: Reduce intracellular drug concentration, especially in Gram-negatives [^683b0382].

---

## Clinical applications

Beta-lactams are **first-line therapy** for many infections, including:

- **Respiratory tract infections**: Pneumonia, bronchitis [^1eaea241].
- **Skin and soft tissue infections**: Cellulitis, abscesses [^ef1316a8].
- **Urinary tract infections**: Pyelonephritis, complicated UTIs [^3f8d0c32].
- **Intra-abdominal infections**: Peritonitis, biliary sepsis [^3f8d0c32].
- **Neutropenic fever**: Empiric therapy in cancer patients [^05653e36].

---

## Safety and allergy considerations

Beta-lactam allergy is common but often mislabeled; **about 10% report allergy**, yet < 1% have true IgE-mediated reactions [^c5bbf20f]. Cross-reactivity varies: cephalosporins have low cross-reactivity with penicillins, especially later generations [^8924e98c]; carbapenems have ~1% cross-reactivity; monobactams (e.g. aztreonam) have minimal cross-reactivity and are often safe in penicillin-allergic patients [^cdb51c77].

---

## Role of beta-lactamase inhibitors

Beta-lactamase inhibitors (clavulanate, tazobactam, avibactam, vaborbactam) are combined with beta-lactams to **overcome resistance** [^a58498ae]. They inhibit β-lactamases, restoring antibiotic activity, but do not inhibit metallo-β-lactamases (e.g. NDM-1) [^a3e8fe5c].

---

## Emerging trends and future directions

- **New combinations**: Ceftazidime-avibactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, imipenem-relebactam expand activity against resistant Gram-negatives [^3f8d0c32].
- **Prolonged infusion**: Improves pharmacodynamic target attainment in critical illness [^8754918c].
- **Therapeutic drug monitoring**: Individualizes dosing in ICU patients to optimize efficacy and minimize toxicity [^32f3a911].

---

Beta-lactam antibiotics remain a cornerstone of antimicrobial therapy due to their broad spectrum, safety, and efficacy, but **resistance and allergy considerations** require judicious use, combination strategies, and ongoing stewardship [^9e2153b9].

In the 80 years since their discovery the β-lactam antibiotics have progressed through structural generations, each in response to the progressive evolution of bacterial resistance mechanisms. The generational progression was driven by the ingenious, but largely empirical, manipulation of structure by medicinal chemists. Nonetheless, the true creative force in these efforts was Nature, and as the discovery of new β-lactams from Nature has atrophied while at the same time multi-resistant and opportunistic bacterial pathogens have burgeoned, the time for empirical drug discovery has passed. We concisely summarize recent developments with respect to bacterial resistance, the identity of the new β-lactams, and the emerging non-empirical strategies that will ensure that this incredible class of antibiotics has a future.

β-Lactams are the most widely prescribed antibiotics used for the control and treatment of bacterial infections. The direct effect of β-lactams on bacteria is well studied worldwide. In the context of infections and as a consequence of their direct activity against the pathogen, β-lactams also regulate antibacterial immune responses. This knowledge has led to the theorem that the effectiveness of β-lactam treatment results from the synergy between the drug and the immune response. Key players in this immune response, with an essential role in the clearance of live and dead bacteria, are the myeloid cells. In this review, we summarize the data that shed light on how β-lactams interact with myeloid cells during bacterial infection treatment.

### Treatment of Gram-negative pneumonia in the critical care setting: is the β-lactam antibiotic backbone broken beyond repair? [^1eaea241]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Beta-lactam antibiotics form the backbone of treatment for Gram-negative pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit. However, this beta-lactam antibiotic backbone is increasingly under pressure from emerging resistance across all geographical regions, and health-care professionals in many countries are rapidly running out of effective treatment options. Even in regions that currently have only low levels of resistance, the effects of globalization are likely to increase local pressures on the beta-lactam antibiotic backbone in the near future. Therefore, clinicians are increasingly faced with a difficult balancing act: the need to prescribe adequate and appropriate antibiotic therapy while reducing the emergence of resistance and the overuse of antibiotics. In this review, we explore the burden of Gram-negative pneumonia in the critical care setting and the pressure that antibiotic resistance places on current empiric therapy regimens (and the beta-lactam antibiotic backbone) in this patient population. New treatment approaches, such as systemic and inhaled antibiotic alternatives, are on the horizon and are likely to help tackle the rising levels of beta-lactam antibiotic resistance. In the meantime, it is imperative that the beta-lactam antibiotic backbone of currently available antibiotics be supported through stringent antibiotic stewardship programs.

### Beta-lactam antibiotic resistance: a current structural perspective [^cf9cb19e]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

Bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics can be achieved by any of three strategies: the production of beta-lactam-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase enzymes, the utilization of beta-lactam-insensitive cell wall transpeptidases, and the active expulsion of beta-lactam molecules from Gram-negative cells by way of efflux pumps. In recent years, structural biology has contributed significantly to the understanding of these processes and should prove invaluable in the design of drugs to combat beta-lactam resistance in the future.

The 'antibiotic backbone'

Antibiotics for the treatment of serious bacterial infections have immeasurable benefits for the critically ill patient and have greatly reduced morbidity and mortality since their widespread adoption in the 1950s. However, global overuse of these drugs has led to the development of resistance and decreased effectiveness, making it increasingly difficult to choose appropriate antibiotic therapy options for life-threatening infections, such as pneumonia, in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The term 'antibiotic backbone' was coined to describe those drugs that form the foundation of antimicrobial therapy; these backbone antibiotics treat most bacterial infections effectively, and appropriate empirical use reduces both mortality and the emergence of resistance. The choice of antibiotics is based on many factors, including recommendations from guidelines and evidence-based reviews. Currently, the antibiotic backbone for the treatment of pneumonia consists of drugs from the beta-lactam class. However, increasing resistance rates are beginning to seriously limit the clinical utility of beta-lactams. Therefore, in this review, we explore the current use of beta-lactam antibiotics, the challenges posed by increasing resistance rates, and how the beta-lactam antibiotic backbone might be strengthened in the future. The article reflects our best knowledge and shared professional opinion of the currently available evidence on the topics discussed, but an exhaustive or systematic review of the literature would be outside of its scope.

Conclusions

For physicians treating pneumonia in critically ill patients, the use of the beta-lactam antibiotic backbone is increasingly fraught with uncertainty. Although beta-lactam antibiotics have played an important role in the treatment of pneumonia in the ICU, resistance rates are high; in part, this has been exacerbated by widespread inappropriate prescribing of extended-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics. The current state of resistance across many antibiotic classes is highly concerning, and the increasing difficulty of treating infections has been described as a 'major blooming public health crisis'.

The diligent application of antimicrobial stewardship principles, together with optimized PK/PD dosing strategies, can help preserve efficacy of the beta-lactam antibiotics — at least for the time being. However, to relieve the pressure on the beta-lactam antibiotic backbone in the long term, new approaches are urgently needed; these are likely to include the increased use of biomarkers, rapid diagnostic techniques, and new treatment approaches such as inhaled antibiotics.

### Beta-lactam antibiotics: newer formulations and newer agents [^0ba05e72]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

beta-Lactam antibiotics share a common structure and mechanism of action, although they differ in their spectrum of antimicrobial activity and utility in treating different infections. The current classes include the penicillins, the penicillinase-resistant penicillins, the extended- spectrum penicillins, the cephalosporins, the carbapenems, and the monobactams. This article discusses some of the newest beta-lactams available for use in the United States: ertapenem, cefditoren, and cefepime. A new formulation of amoxicillin-clavulanate, which contains higher doses of amoxicillin, is also discussed.

Key messages

- Among ICU patients, the PK of β-lactam antibiotics are markedly unpredictable.

- A large volume of distribution is commonly observed in ICU patients and contributes to a lower antibiotic concentration, but also to a greater exposure time.

- An increased glomerular filtration rate is usually associated with a short half-life of β-lactam antibiotics, whilst renal failure is associated with a greater exposure and increased risk of accumulation.

- Continuous infusion of β-lactam antibiotics commonly increases the time that the antibiotic concentration exceeds its MIC and may therefore increase efficacy.

- Therapeutic drug monitoring of β-lactam antibiotic concentration may help to improve its efficacy and prevent toxicity, but currently is unavailable in most clinical settings.

### Limitations of β-lactam therapy for infections caused by susceptible Gram-positive bacteria [^fb66ba8e]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Penicillin and related beta-lactam agents have been the most widely used and most important antimicrobials in medical history, and remain the recommended therapy for many infectious diseases 85 years after the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming. Yet the efficacy of these agents has been undermined by two factors - the emergence of clinically significant resistance to the antimicrobial activity of these agents, and clinical situations in which these drugs may be suboptimal (even though the bacterial pathogens are not "resistant" to the drugs). Observations in experimental infection models in animals (group A streptococcal myositis, pneumococcal meningitis and pneumonia, group B streptococcal sepsis) and in some cases clinical studies suggest that monotherapy with beta-lactam antibiotics may be inferior to treatment with other types of antibiotics, alone or in combination with beta-lactams - even in situations where the bacterial pathogens remain fully "susceptible" to beta-lactams in vitro.

### Hypersensitivity reactions to β-lactam antibiotics [^c5bbf20f]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Clinicians commonly encounter patients with a history of allergy to penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics, since about 10% of the population reports such an allergy. At the same time, it is known that about 90% of these patients are not truly allergic and could safely receive beta-lactam antibiotics. Instead, these patients are treated unnecessarily with alternate broad-spectrum antibiotics, which increases costs and contributes to the development and spread of multiple drug-resistant bacteria. In the case of penicillin, relevant allergenic determinants that elicit immune responses are known. Hence, validated diagnostic skin testing to detect the presence of drug-specific IgE antibodies is available. For non-penicillin beta-lactams, the immunogenic determinants that are produced by degradation are unknown, and diagnostic skin testing is of more limited value. Ideally, patients with a history of penicillin allergy should be evaluated when they are well and not in immediate need of antibiotic therapy. Patients who are found to be penicillin skin test-negative may be safely treated with all beta-lactam antibiotics. Penicillin skin test-positive patients should only receive a penicillin-class antibiotic via rapid desensitization, and only in cases when an alternative agent cannot be substituted. Penicillin skin test-positive patients may be safely treated with monobactams. The extent of allergic cross-reactivity between penicillin arid cephalosporins/carbapenems is uncertain; therefore penicillin skin test-positive patients should only receive these antibiotics via cautious graded challenge or desensitization. Identification of patients who erroneously carry a label of beta-lactam allergy leads to improved utilization of antibiotics and slows the spread of multiple drug-resistant bacteria.

### Management of patients with a history of allergy to β-lactam antibiotics [^f7ce356a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with a history of penicillin allergy pose a treatment dilemma. Unnecessary avoidance of this relatively nontoxic class of drugs exposes the patient to potentially more toxic drugs, increases health care costs, and contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance. Yet for those who truly have allergy or other serious adverse reactions to beta-lactams, the use of alternate drugs is a must. This article reviews current management strategies to determine which patients are good candidates for reintroduction of beta-lactams and which patients should continue avoidance.

### Escape mutations circumvent a tradeoff between resistance to a β-lactam and resistance to a β-lactamase inhibitor [^0f644671]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, mediated primarily through beta-lactamases, is growing as a major threat to public health. Beta-lactams are commonly used for the treatment of a range of bacterial pathogens, constituting the most widely prescribed antibiotic class. These antibiotics are characterized by a core of a beta-lactam ring and are classified by their moieties into four major families: penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and monobactams. The irreversible binding of these drugs to the peptidoglycan cross-linking enzymes (Penicillin Binding Proteins, PBPs) leads to cell death and lysis. Resistance to beta-lactams has become widespread in recent years, mainly through drug degradation by beta-lactamases, most notably by the serine beta-lactamases of classes A and C. Hydrolyzing the core beta-lactam ring, these enzymes decrease the effective drug concentration, thereby conferring increased resistance –. The effectiveness of these enzymes is often further improved either by mutations that increase their expression or by intragenic structural mutations that enhance their efficacy and specificity –. To overcome beta-lactamase mediated antibiotic resistance, beta-lactam antibiotic treatments are often supplemented by a beta-lactamase inhibitor –. These inhibitors compete with the drug for the same binding site, yet being resilient to degradation they block enzyme activity thereby restoring antibiotic efficacy. While class A beta-lactamase inhibitors, such as clavulanate or tazobactam, are commonly used, efficient inhibitors of the widespread class C beta-lactamases have only recently been introduced.

### Treatment of Gram-negative pneumonia in the critical care setting: is the β-lactam antibiotic backbone broken beyond repair? [^fe4daf28]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The consequences of a broken beta-lactam antibiotic backbone

A broken beta-lactam antibiotic backbone means that bacterial infections cannot be reliably treated empirically with a particular antibiotic regimen. The emergence of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics has exerted significant pressure on the antibiotic backbone, resulting in increased morbidity, mortality, and health-care costs. Indeed, ineffective therapy can lead to many complications, including adverse events, superinfections, emergence of resistance, increased ICU or hospital length of stay, increased hospitalization costs, antibiotic-induced organ dysfunction, and often the need to prescribe additional antibiotics. Patients with MDR Gram-negative pneumonia may be at greater risk of death than those infected with a non-MDR organism. For example, in a recent international multicenter study in patients with P. aeruginosa nosocomial pneumonia, infection with MDR strains was associated with significantly higher in-hospital mortality compared with infection with non-MDR strains (44.7% versus 31.7%, P < 0.001). However, the overall evidence on a potential association of mortality outcomes with MDR infection in patients with pneumonia is still unclear.

### Which antibiotics are best for skin and soft tissue infections?… [^ef1316a8]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Background: Bacterial skin and soft tissue infections have traditionally responded well to treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics or macro-lides. However, there has been concern whether they are still effective given the emerging resistance of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species. Consequently, physicians have started using broader-spectrum beta-lactams or fluoroqui-nolones to treat SSTIs in the belief that they may be more effective, despite limited evidence to support this approach. Falagas and colleagues conducted a meta-analysis of studies comparing the beta-lactams with fluoro-quinolones in the empiric treatment of SSTIs. Results: Twenty studies involving 4, 817 patients were reviewed.

The beta-lactam agents included in the studies were extended-spectrum agents; first-generation ceph-alosporins; and third-generation cephalosporins. Overall, fluoroquinolones were more effective than beta-lactam antibiotics for empirically treating SSTIs, but the difference was small. Fluoroquinolones also were more effective in treating mild to moderate SSTIs. However, both of these advantages disappeared when third-generation cephalosporins were excluded from the analysis. There also was no difference between the antibiotic classes in the treatment of moderate to severe infections.

Conclusion: The authors concluded that although fluo-roquinolones were slightly more effective in treating SSTIs compared with beta-lactam antibiotics, this difference disappeared when third-generation cephalosporins were excluded. When the greater adverse effect profile of fluoroquinolones was also considered, there was no substantial advantage to using them over beta-lactam agents for the empiric treatment of SSTIs. Although third-generation cephalosporins often are used to treat SSTIs, they appear to be less effective than extended-spectrum penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins.

PICO question VIII — nonseverely ill adults receiving prolonged-infusion (PI) β-lactam antibiotics states the clinical question and a conditional recommendation as follows: "Should PI β-lactam antibiotics be preferred over SI in nonseverely ill adult patients to improve mortality and clinical cure?" and "We cannot recommend for or against PI β-lactam antibiotics over SI to reduce mortality and increase clinical cure among nonseverely ill adult patients. (Conditional recommendation; very low certainty of evidence)."

### Pharmacodynamic optimization of β-lactams in the patient care setting [^094520ec]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

In order to eradicate an infecting organism, it is necessary to achieve or maintain concentrations of an antibiotic in vivo that exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the organism. Duration of exposure, or time above MIC, was recognized as being important for beta-lactam antibiotics more than 60 years ago. Continuous infusion regimens are associated with higher clinical response rates, improvement in surrogate markers of outcome, and lower cost of therapy compared with intermittent infusion regimens, because the MIC can be exceeded for an entire dosing interval. However, for carbapenem antibiotics, it appears that the MIC must only be exceeded for 40% of the dosing interval for bactericidal activity in vivo. Therefore, a promising strategy to optimize carbapenem use is to administer the same dose at the same frequency of administration but to extend the infusion time. Extended infusion regimens take full advantage of a drug's exposure potential within the context of in vivo potency without altering the dose or dosing schedule and with no increase in toxicity or cost. Administering higher doses by extended infusion allows one to manage organisms with high MICs. Optimizing the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of an antibiotic allows one to 'make good drugs better'.

### Antibiotic allergy [^121e8a97]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Although allergy to β-lactam and non-β-lactam antibiotics is commonly claimed, true allergy to these drugs is often absent. Reactions to antibiotics can be classified according to the interval between the last administration of the drug and the onset of symptoms, but except for immediate reactions occurring within an hour of exposure, which are almost always either IgE-mediated or due to direct stimulation of mast cells, reactions occurring later than 1 hour probably have multiple mechanisms, including being IgE-mediated or involving cell-mediated reactions. The latter are likely caused by drug-specific T lymphocytes. The diagnosis of antibiotic allergy can be difficult.

### Inhibitors of metallo-β-lactamases [^9d34fbbc]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

The β-lactams are the most successful class of antibiotic drugs but they are vulnerable to inactivation by a growing cadre of β-lactamases that now number more than a thousand variants. β-Lactamases operate by one of two general chemical mechanisms either catalyzing β-lactam ring hydrolysis via a covalent enzyme intermediate through the aegis of an active site serine residue or through a noncovalent Zn-dependent mechanism. The Ser-β-lactamases are currently dominant in the clinic and consequently, there has been great effort to identify inhibitors and to co-formulate these with β-lactam antibiotics. Four such inhibitors are approved for human clinical use and several more are in clinical trials. Metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs), on the other hand, are only now emerging as a global threat and consequently, inhibitor discovery has lagged behind their Ser counterparts. There are now several examples of MBL inhibitors that operate either in a Zn-dependent or Zn-independent mode. The Zn-dependent compounds are more prevalent and some show efficacy in animal models of infection. These compounds function by either acting as an alternate metal ligand, usually displacing a jointly held hydroxide ion shared by enzymes with two Zn 2+ ions, or alternately by striping Zn from the active site. The increase in the number of candidate MBL inhibitors over recent years reflects the growing clinical challenge of pathogens expressing these enzymes that result in a carbapenem resistance phenotype. While none of these inhibitors are yet in human clinical trials, the increasing importance of these enzymes in drug failure is a strong incentive to continue identifying and characterizing such molecules.

### Copy number flexibility facilitates heteroresistance to increasing antibiotic pressure and threatens the β-lactam pipeline [^ed82aeab]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Antibiotic resistance is a growing crisis causing over 1 million worldwide deaths in 2019. Without significant intervention, this number is predicted to rise to 10 million annual deaths by 2050. The staggering death toll can be partly attributed to the widespread dissemination of antibiotic resistance, the rapid emergence of resistance to novel antibiotics, and a lagging pipeline for the development of novel classes of antibiotics. Variations of β-lactams and β-lactamase inhibitors have dominated the antibiotic pipeline in part because of their efficacy, low toxicity, and the many obstaclesthat hinder the development of completely novel antibiotic classes. In 2020, 47% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in the United States were β-lactams, nearing 100 million. Five of nine new antibiotics expected to treat highly resistant Gram-negative pathogens and approved from 2014 to 2020 were β-lactams, and as of 2020, 7/7 antibiotics in Phase III testing were β-lactams. This reliance on β-lactam antibiotics is a healthcare vulnerability since resistance emerges quickly following clinical introduction; for example, resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam was described less than a year following introduction. However, the reasons for this rapid resistance are unclear.

### Escape mutations circumvent a tradeoff between resistance to a β-lactam and resistance to a β-lactamase inhibitor [^33bdafea]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Beta-lactamase inhibitors are increasingly used to counteract antibiotic resistance mediated by beta-lactamase enzymes. These inhibitors compete with the beta-lactam antibiotic for the same binding site on the beta-lactamase, thus generating an evolutionary tradeoff: mutations that increase the enzyme's beta-lactamase activity tend to increase also its susceptibility to the inhibitor. Here, we investigate how common and accessible are mutants that escape this adaptive tradeoff. Screening a deep mutant library of the bla ampC beta-lactamase gene of Escherichia coli, we identified mutations that allow growth at beta-lactam concentrations far exceeding those inhibiting growth of the wildtype strain, even in the presence of the enzyme inhibitor (avibactam). These escape mutations are rare and drug-specific, and some combinations of avibactam with beta-lactam drugs appear to prevent such escape phenotypes. Our results, showing differential adaptive potential of bla ampC to combinations of avibactam and different beta-lactam antibiotics, suggest that it may be possible to identify treatments that are more resilient to evolution of resistance.

### Time-resolved β-lactam cleavage by L1 metallo-β-lactamase [^dac6751b]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Treatment of bacterial infections with β-lactam based antibiotics is the most common approach used in clinics and currently accounts for ~65% of all applied antibiotics. These widely used compounds include drugs with a broad-spectrum substrate profile such as penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams, and carbapenems. Antibiotics with β-lactam core mimic substrates of bacterial transpeptidases essential for cell-wall remodeling and they block the formation of cross-bridges between adjacent peptidoglycan chains causing bacteria death. The massive world-wide use of β-lactam antibiotics resulted in microorganisms becoming drug resistant and this represents a major threat to human health and wellbeing. Many multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) microbial strains require elaborate treatments or escape available cures entirely. It is projected that by 2050, the increase in mortality caused by infections with MDR/XDR pathogens will grow beyond the level predicted for cancer. New treatments and discovery of more effective inhibitors for enzymes responsible for MDR/XDR are urgently needed.

### Private benefit of β-lactamase dictates selection dynamics of combination antibiotic treatment [^b04ad552]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

β-lactams are the most commonly prescribed antibiotic in the United States todayin both inpatientand outpatientsettings. This broad class, which includes the penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and monobactams, includes both first-line antibiotics for many outpatient cases, as well as agents reserved for cases in which other regimens have failed. As with many antibiotics, however, resistance to β-lactams has become prevalent as an evolutionary consequence of their use. Of note is the steadily increasing incidence – of resistant infections by the Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae. Resistance in these infections is associated with higher mortality, delay in effective therapy, and higher healthcare costs. With the novel antibiotic pipeline thinning due to several economic and scientific factors, maximizing the efficacy of existing antibiotics is key to minimizing the impacts of resistance.

One strategy to potentiate existing antibiotics against resistant bacteria is to pair them with adjuvants that can inhibit the mechanism of resistance –. Resistance to β-lactams in Gram-negative bacteria is primarily mediated by β-lactamase (Bla) enzymes, which hydrolyze the β-lactam ring and inactivate the antibiotic. Bla inhibitors can bind to the active site of the enzyme, preventing hydrolytic activity and restoring antibiotic sensitivity. They have been used in combination with β-lactams since the discovery of clavulanic acid in the 1970s. Inhibitors with activity against more diverse β-lactam classes, such as the recently approved durlobactam, have since been developed.

While Bla inhibitors permit clinical treatment of resistant populations, the use of β-lactam/Bla inhibitor combinations, like many antibiotics, is empirical. The diagnosis of common infectious diseases is often done by symptom rather than by infectious agent; when specific bacteria are diagnosed, it may be done only at the species level; and when antibiotic resistance is screened, it is typically done with only a final timepoint measurement or single-gene marker for resistance, obscuring dynamics that affect the course of treatment. In prescription, the most relevant differences between agents that perform roughly the same function, such as the different Bla inhibitors clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam, seem to be their pharmacokinetic similarity to the β-lactams they are formulated with. This coformulation, a consequence of the regulatory framework for combination drugs, also limits the flexibility with which the two components (antibiotic and Bla inhibitor) can be dosed. These realities all lead to a one-size-fits-all approach to antibiotic administration.

### Taking a rational approach to a reported antibiotic allergy [^ad49e8a0]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Up to 10% of hospitalized patients have an antibiotic allergy label in their medical file, most frequently concerning penicillins. However, the vast majority of reported allergies to antibiotics does not represent a "true" allergy but are due to drug intolerance, idiosyncratic reactions or symptoms of the concurrent infectious disease. Since antibiotic allergy labels result in deviation from first-choice antimicrobial therapy, tackling the issue of incorrect antibiotic allergy labelling, already at young age, is a core element of antibiotic stewardship. In this article, we describe the structured approach to the patient with a presumed antibiotic allergy with emphasis on key elements of allergy-specific history taking and the limited risk of cross-allergic reactions between beta-lactam subclasses.

### Treatment of Gram-negative pneumonia in the critical care setting: is the β-lactam antibiotic backbone broken beyond repair? [^ccbcb4b7]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

One way to optimize beta-lactam antibiotic dosing may be the use of prolonged or continuous infusion, which could benefit critically ill patients with severe illness. Continuous infusion of beta-lactams often also includes the use of a loading dose to ensure early attainment of target concentrations exceeding the MIC. Currently, clinical evidence is still unclear as to whether it is better to give beta-lactam antibiotics by traditional intermittent bolus dosing or continuous infusion. Theoretically, continuous infusion of beta-lactam antibiotics should be advantageous, because it produces more sustained antibiotic concentrations above the MIC (a key measure to describe the bacterial kill characteristics of beta-lactams). A number of reports suggest that continuous infusion has clinical benefits (reviewed in). For example, one RCT in 30 patients with severe sepsis reported that continuous administration of beta-lactam antibiotics achieved higher plasma antibiotic concentrations than intermittent administration, with associated improvements in clinical cure (70% versus 43%, P = 0.037); however, a more recent and larger (n = 432) trial by the same research group, again conducted in critically ill patients with severe sepsis, reported no difference in outcomes between beta-lactam antibiotic administration by continuous and intermittent infusion. Indeed, two comprehensive systematic meta-analyses suggest that, overall, clinical studies in critically ill patients with acute infections have not yet conclusively demonstrated the benefits of continuous over bolus infusion; one of these analyses did suggest a benefit in mortality outcomes, whereas the other did not. Clearly, further evidence, particularly from large RCTs, is needed.

Another potential strategy to help overcome the antibiotic dosing challenges in patients in the ICU may be therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). However, a recent systematic review found that only a small number of the included studies reported that TDM may improve beta-lactam dosing in critically ill patients. The systematic review also found little agreement between studies on the pharmacodynamic targets for optimizing antibiotic therapy. Clearly, more data are needed before any potential clinical benefits of TDM can be established. However, even if clinical improvements can be conclusively demonstrated, TDM is currently not routinely available in most clinical laboratories.

Conclusions

The PK of β-lactam antibiotics are significantly changed in septic ICU patients. Dosage and schedule regimens based on data from healthy volunteers may be misleading. Therapeutic drug monitoring and PD modelling according to measured PK previously showed promising results. Continuous infusion, although theoretically useful, has not been shown to lead to improved outcomes. The clinical significance of tissue PK monitoring remains to be determined.

### An overview of harms associated with β-lactam antimicrobials: where do the carbapenems fit in? [^315f8d5d]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The US Institute of Medicine's focus on patient safety has motivated hospital administrators to facilitate a culture of safety. As a result, subcommittees of the pharmacy and therapeutics committee have emerged in many hospitals to focus on adverse events and patient safety. Antimicrobial harms have gained the attention of practicing clinicians and hospital formulary committees, because they top the list of drugs that are associated with adverse events and because of certain serious harms that have ultimately led to the withdrawal of some antimicrobial agents. In the near future, several antimicrobials in the late phase of development will become available for clinical use (ceftobiprole, ceftaroline, and telavancin), and others (doripenem and dalbavancin) have recently joined the armamentarium. Because new antimicrobials will become part of the treatment armamentarium, it is important to discuss our current understanding of antimicrobial harms in general. Although not thought of as traditional adverse events, Clostridium difficile infection and development of resistance during therapy are adverse events that occur as a result of antimicrobial exposure and therefore are discussed. In addition, a distillation of our current understanding of beta-lactam specific adverse events will be provided. Finally, new methods of administration are being evaluated that may influence peak concentration-related antimicrobial adverse events.

### Antibiotics in critically ill patients: a systematic review of the pharmacokinetics of β-lactams [^a91ae426]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Ideally, individualized dosing strategies should account for the altered PK and pathogen susceptibility in each patient. Despite the fact that some studies addressed this issue, this information had not yet been aggregated. Furthermore, β-lactam antibiotic PK are rarely analysed outside clinical trials. Therefore, we performed a systematic review of studies that addressed the PK parameters of β-lactam antibiotics in ICU patients to assess the relationship between dose and schedule of β-lactam antibiotics and their adequacy according to pharmacodynamic (PD) end points. We also reviewed studies assessing the concentrations of β-lactam antibiotics in different tissues. Our primary intention was to aggregate PK information in this particular population and to contribute to the design of individualized dosing regimens of these drugs.

We also included studies that involved the development of PD models using PK of ICU patients and bacterial MICs. These techniques allow the calculation of the presumed T > MIC and therefore the percentage of patients in which the antibiotic will achieve its PD target: that is, the antibiotic's probability of target attainment (PTA). The cumulative fraction of response (CFR) is calculated by multiplying the PTA obtained for each MIC by the MIC distribution according to a microbiological database.

### New β-lactamases in gram-negative bacteria: diversity and impact on the selection of antimicrobial therapy [^87a1bfef]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Of the 340 discrete beta-lactamases that have been identified, the most important groups of enzymes that are continuing to proliferate include the plasmid-encoded cephalosporinases, the metallo-beta-lactamases, and the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Resistance to specific beta-lactam-containing antimicrobial agents frequently can be traced to a single beta-lactamase, but this task is becoming more difficult for the clinical microbiology laboratory. Other factors, such as multiple beta-lactamase production, transferable multidrug-resistance genes, alterations in outer-membrane porins, and possible antibiotic efflux, all may contribute to a resistance phenotype. Appreciation of these factors may help the physician make a more informed decision when choosing therapy to try to avoid selection of even more pathogenic strains.

### Evolution and clinical importance of extended-spectrum β-lactamases [^fb9ed04c]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

In the process of evolution, bacteria have acquired well-developed mechanisms of resistance to an extensive array of hostile substances. This time-tempered system of defense is so intricate and adaptable that contemporary medicine has been hard-pressed to maintain an advantage. In this article, the processes responsible for bacterial resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins are reviewed. Particular emphasis is placed on the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases that have emerged to provide bacteria with formidable resistance to modern drugs. Avoidance of this problem requires limitations on extended-spectrum cephalosporin usage. While carbapenems are clearly the treatment of choice for infections caused by these pathogens, empirical use of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors such as piperacillin/tazobactam has been associated with reduction in the prevalence of cephalosporin resistance.

This review looks at the main issues around immediate hypersensitivity and the role and limitations of testing. The majority of literature on antibiotic hypersensitivity relates to β-lactam antibiotics, mainly because of the heavy usage of this class of drugs. Concerns around cross-reactivity always worry clinicians, particularly in the emergency situation. Reasonable data now exist in relation to β-lactam antibiotics and derivatives, which enable appropriate risk management to be undertaken. The available literature for other classes of antibiotics is also discussed.

### Beta-lactam antibiotic therapeutic drug monitoring in critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^32f3a911]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is common in critically ill patients, being present in up to 40% of those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). For patients hospitalized with septic shock, 30-day mortality rates are as high as 37%. In 2017, sepsis accounted for nearly 20% of deaths (11 million) and 48.9 million cases worldwide. Prompt identification and management with timely and appropriate antimicrobial therapy is a key component in the resuscitation of the septic patient. The 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign: International Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock recommend dose optimization of antimicrobials based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) principles. In the context of beta-lactam antibiotics (beta-lactams), these recommendations include extending the infusion time (3 hours or more) and using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), which involves dose adjustment based on measured concentrations to achieve predefined efficacy targets to optimize drug exposure. These recommendations aim to counter the pathophysiological changes that occur in critical illness, which significantly alter beta-lactam pharmacokinetics. Observational studies have demonstrated inferior clinical outcomes in critically ill patients that do not achieve optimal beta-lactam exposure. While beta-lactam TDM is gaining wider application in the critical care setting, major barriers to its routine use include limited availability of data on its implementation, cost-effectiveness, and impact on patient-centered outcomes. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether the use of TDM-guided dose optimization of beta-lactams improves clinical outcomes in critically ill patients.

### Exploiting the aggregation propensity of β-lactamases to design inhibitors that induce enzyme misfolding [^5b046259]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

There is an arms race between beta-lactam antibiotics development and co-evolving beta-lactamases, which provide resistance by breaking down beta-lactam rings. We have observed that certain beta-lactamases tend to aggregate, which persists throughout their evolution under the selective pressure of antibiotics on their active sites. Interestingly, we find that existing beta-lactamase active site inhibitors can act as molecular chaperones, promoting the proper folding of these resistance factors. Therefore, we have created Pept-Ins, synthetic peptides designed to exploit the structural weaknesses of beta-lactamases by causing them to misfold into intracellular inclusion bodies. This approach restores sensitivity to a wide range of beta-lactam antibiotics in resistant clinical isolates, including those with Extended Spectrum variants that pose significant challenges in medical practice. Our findings suggest that targeted aggregation of resistance factors could offer a strategy for identifying molecules that aid in addressing the global antibiotic resistance crisis.

### The urgent need for metallo-β-lactamase inhibitors: an unattended global threat [^a3e8fe5c]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Due to their superior tolerability and efficacy, β-lactams are the most potent and prescribed class of antibiotics in the clinic. The emergence of resistance to those antibiotics, mainly due to the production of bacterial enzymes called β-lactamases, has been partially solved by the introduction of β-lactamase inhibitors, which restore the activity of otherwise obsolete molecules. This solution is limited because currently available β-lactamase inhibitors only work against serine β-lactamases, whereas metallo-β-lactamases continue to spread, evolve, and confer resistance to all β-lactams, including carbapenems. Furthermore, the increased use of antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial pneumonia in severely sick patients with COVID-19 might exacerbate the problem of antimicrobial resistance. In this Personal View, we summarise the main advances accomplished in this area of research, emphasise the main challenges that need to be solved, and the importance of research on inhibitors for metallo-B-lactamases amidst the current pandemic.

### Structural basis of broad-spectrum β-lactam resistance in Staphylococcus aureus [^ab0162bc]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Main

Staphylococcus aureus underlies one of the top three most deadly drug-resistant bacterial infections worldwide. Strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) are particularly problematic owing to their prevalence in nosocomial and community-acquired infections, increased rates of morbidity and death, as well as elevated healthcare costs. MRSA is notorious for its ability to acquire resistance to not only β-lactams but also many other classes of antibiotics. The drugs typically used to treat MRSA infections, such as vancomycin, are less effective, more toxic and are subject to established and growing resistance mechanisms as evidenced in vancomycin-resistant S. aureus strains –. Despite some progress in the development of new therapeutics, S. aureus has recently been estimated to cause more than a quarter of all mortality attributed to antimicrobial resistance in economically developed countries, demonstrating that improved treatment options are urgently required. A clearer understanding of resistance in this pathogen could facilitate the development of new cocktail therapies to preserve β-lactam action.

Fourth area. Therapeutic drug monitoring of beta-lactam antibiotics

Which modalities of therapeutic drug monitoring of the treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics should be used to decrease morbidity and mortality of ICU patients?

R4.1. We suggest performing therapeutic drug monitoring in ICU patients with expected beta-lactam PK variability and/or in patients with clinical signs potentially related to beta-lactams toxicity.

Optional recommendation — strong agreement

Few studies have assessed the impact of beta-lactam therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in ICU patients, and none of these studies reported an impact on clinical outcome. However, drug exposure and PK-PD target attainment have been shown to be higher when using TDM. Due to the large PK variability of beta-lactam antibiotics reported in ICU patients (cf. first area), TDM appears then as an important tool to avoid drug under- or overdosage, as recently described by Wong et al.

### Outcomes from an inpatient β-lactam allergy guideline across a large US health system [^e3575ed5]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Beta-lactam antibiotic allergies, reported by up to 15% of hospitalized patients, impact acute-care antibiotic prescribing. Cephalosporins, antibiotics important to the treatment of common inpatient infections, are inconsistently prescribed to patients reporting penicillin allergies despite low cross reactivity. – Alternatives to β-lactam antibiotics may be less effective, and can lead to adverse sequelae for patients, most notably healthcare-associated infections such as Clostridioides difficile infection.

Most patients with a documented penicillin allergy do not have clinically significant hypersensitivity and can be safely treated with penicillins and other β-lactams. Although penicillin allergy evaluation is encouraged by antibiotic stewardship guidelines, penicillin skin testing (PST) is operationally challenging in acute-care settings. Furthermore, many of the antibiotics generally used in hospitalized patients after a negative PST can be administered safely without preceding PST with a full-dose or test-dose challenge. –

The Partners HealthCare System (PHS) guideline for inpatients with β-lactam allergy histories is an antibiotic stewardship tool that includes penicillin and cephalosporin hypersensitivity pathways that direct PST when institutionally available and needed (ie, patients reporting IgE-mediated allergy symptoms to a penicillin who require a penicillin or cross-reactive cephalosporin), but it encourages direct full-dose and test-dose (ie, standardized 2-step graded) drug challenges. Prior to this study, our results demonstrated that the guideline safely increased β-lactam antibiotic use at 2 academic medical centers. – In this study, we sought to further assess the safety of guideline-directed β-lactam antibiotic test doses after implementation of the computerized guideline throughout 5 acute-care PHS hospitals with varied resources.

### Time-resolved β-lactam cleavage by L1 metallo-β-lactamase [^bfed061b]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The most important mechanism of β-lactam antibiotics resistance is enzymatic hydrolysis by the bacterial β-lactamases. The β-lactamase's genes are of natural origin, and are broadly present in various environments, including those that have not been exposed to synthetic antibiotics. The genes are often located on mobile plasmids and can integrate with and be maintained on the bacterial chromosome. The enzymes are frequently very promiscious, but also evolve by mutations in response to the presence of new antibiotics. There are four classes of β-lactamases (A, B, C and D). The most important enzymes belong to class B and bind one or two metal ions, typically Zn 2+, playing key roles in the substrate binding and catalysis. They are called metallo-β-lactamases (MBL) and are divided into three subclasses based on their protein sequence, substrate profiles and variations in their active site configurations for Zn 2+ ions. MBLs from B1 and B3 subclasses are highly promiscuous and can hydrolyze nearly every β-lactam containing antibiotic, including the most recently developed last-resort carbapenems. Substrate promiscuity of MBLs stems from their structure having a large, open binding site consisting of multiple flexible loops and a di-nuclear Zn 2+ scaffold which anchors β-lactam moiety of a broad range of substrates carrying different substituents. In contrast, class B2 enzymes have a narrow spectrum carbapenem substrate profile, with poor activity toward penicillins and cephalosporins. Notably, MBLs are not inactivated by mechanism-based inhibitors like FDA-approved clavulanate or tazobactam that form an irreversible covalent adduct with the enzyme. Studies of MBLs to develop new treatments and prevent another possible global pandemic yielded, thus far, no breakthrough.

### Recommendations for the management of β-lactam intolerance [^0e53502d]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Beta-lactam intolerance, most of which is not IgE or even immunologically mediated even though it is commonly called an "allergy", can be safely managed using the following seven steps: 1. Avoid testing, re-challenging, or desensitizing individuals with histories of beta-lactam associated toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome, severe hepatitis, interstitial nephritis, or hemolytic anemia. 2. Avoid unnecessary antibiotic use, especially in the setting of viral infections. 3. Expect new intolerances to be reported after 0.5 to 4% of all antibiotic utilizations, dependent on gender and the specific antibiotic used. 4. Expect a higher incidence of new intolerances in individuals with three or more medication intolerances already noted in their medical records. 5. For individuals with an appropriate penicillin class antibiotic intolerance based on a history of anaphylaxis, urticaria, macular papular rashes, unknown symptoms, or symptoms not excluded in step one, proceed with penicillin skin testing. Skin test with penicilloyl-poly-lysine and native penicillin. If skin test is negative, proceed with an oral amoxicillin challenge. If skin test and oral challenge are negative, penicillin class antibiotics may be used. If skin test or oral challenge is positive, avoid penicillin class antibiotics. If skin test or oral challenge is positive, non-penicillin-beta-lactams may be used, unless there is a history of intolerance to a specific non-penicillin-beta-lactam, then avoid that specific non-penicillin-beta-lactam. If there is life-threatening infection that can only be treated with a penicillin class antibiotic, proceed with oral penicillin desensitization prior to any oral or parenteral penicillin use. 6. For individuals with an appropriate non-penicillin-beta-lactam intolerance, avoid re-exposure to the beta-lactam implicated. An alternative beta-lactam may be used, ideally with different side chains. Penicillin allergy testing is not useful in the management of non-penicillin-beta-lactam intolerance. Non-penicillin-beta-lactam skin testing is not clinically useful and should not be done outside of a research setting. If the non-penicillin-beta-lactam implicated is needed to treat a life-threatening infection, proceed with desensitization. 7. Be ready to treat anaphylaxis with all parenteral beta-lactam use.

### Interplay between β-lactamases and new β-lactamase inhibitors [^a58498ae]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2019). High credibility.

Resistance to β-lactam antibiotics in Gram-negative bacteria is commonly associated with production of β-lactamases, including extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases belonging to different molecular classes: those with a catalytically active serine and those with at least one active-site Zn 2+ to facilitate hydrolysis. To counteract the hydrolytic activity of these enzymes, combinations of a β-lactam with a β-lactamase inhibitor (BLI) have been clinically successful. However, some β-lactam-BLI combinations have lost their effectiveness against prevalent Gram-negative pathogens that produce ESBLs, carbapenemases or multiple β-lactamases in the same organism. In this Review, descriptions are provided for medically relevant β-lactamase families and various BLI combinations that have been developed or are under development. Recently approved inhibitor combinations include the inhibitors avibactam and vaborbactam of the diazabicyclooctanone and boronic acid inhibitor classes, respectively, as new scaffolds for future inhibitor design.

### Β-lactamase expression induces collateral sensitivity in Escherichia coli [^20f56ddb]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

β-lactams are the most prescribed antibiotics, and resistance rates are skyrocketing among clinical pathogens. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) consider β-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacteria among the world's most serious threats. This has led to a worldwide effort to potentiate the activity of existing β-lactam antibiotics by developing new β-lactamase inhibitors, among other strategies –. In this regard, our results pave the way for novel therapies that exploit CS using COL and AZI in combination with β-lactam antibiotics to eliminate β-lactamase-producing bacteria. We note, however, that the magnitude of the CS response in our experiments is moderate (2-8-fold reductions in MIC). While this result is similar to the CS responses found elsewhere, more research is needed before β-lactamase-induced CS can be exploited therapeutically. The rational design of novel derivatives of macrolides and polymyxins – or novel antibiotic combinations, hold promise for increasing the efficacy of treatments against β-lactamase-producing bacteria. In summary, future work will be needed to understand the molecular mechanism(s) behind β-lactamase-induced CS and to find or design compounds that exploit it efficiently.

### MRSA: treating people with infection [^80830b04]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has a gene that makes it resistant to methicillin, as well as to other beta-lactam antibiotics, including flucloxacillin, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. MRSA can be part of the normal body flora (colonisation), especially in the nose, but it can cause infection, particularly in people with prolonged hospital admissions, with underlying disease, or after antibiotic use. About 8% of S aureus in blood cultures in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland is resistant to methicillin.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of selected treatments for MRSA infections at any body site? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2014 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 312 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 133 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 55 studies and the further review of 78 full publications. Of the 78 full articles evaluated, 15 systematic reviews and one subsequent RCT were added at this update. In addition, six studies were added to the Comment sections. We performed a GRADE evaluation for 12 PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic overview we categorised the efficacy for five interventions, based on information about the effectiveness and safety of cephalosporins (ceftobiprole, ceftaroline), daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, pristinamycin (streptogramins), and tigecycline.

Current treatment options for infections with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae

The optimal treatment of infections with CRE is uncertain, as most data come from retrospective case series and anecdotal case reports; few prospective studies or randomized controlled trials are published on this topic. Since carbapenem-producing organisms are often resistant to other antimicrobial classes in addition to most beta-lactams, additional susceptibility testing to antimicrobials such as colistin, fosfomycin, tigecycline, aztreonam, and rifampin is needed. Consultations from experts in the treatment of infections with multidrug-resistant organisms may also prove valuable in patient management. The following antimicrobial therapies have been used with various levels of success in the treatment of CRE infections.

Guidelines

First area. Pharmacokinetic variability of beta-lactam antibiotics

Which elements of PK variability of beta-lactam antibiotics should be taken into account to decrease morbidity and mortality in ICU patients?

R1.1. We suggest considering systematically and daily the many sources of pharmacokinetic variability when prescribing beta-lactam antibiotics to critical care patients.

Optional recommendation — strong agreement

The use of antibiotics in critical care patients is complex as a result of the large variability of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and various sources of this variability.

The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) associated with sepsis, the use of catecholamines and intravenous (IV) fluids, the types of lesions (burns, mediastinitis, etc.), the existence of organ failures (shock, renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction, etc.), and the use of extra-corporal therapies (mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, etc.) can substantially change the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics in ICU patients. The DALI multicenter international study has well illustrated the problem of PK variability of beta-lactams in the intensive care setting. Considerable variability of amoxicillin, ampicillin, cefazolin, cefepime, ceftriaxone, doripenem, meropenem, and piperacillin concentrations measured in the plasma from 361 critically ill patients was observed, with concentrations that could vary by a factor of 100 from one patient to another. This study also reported the influence of this variability on the clinical response, as low plasma beta-lactam concentration was associated with reduced probability of positive clinical outcome (defined as the "completion of treatment course without change or addition of antibiotic therapy, and with no additional antibiotics commenced with 48 h of cessation"). In addition to this significant variability of PK parameters observed for the same beta-lactam antibiotic among different patients (inter-individual variability), significant variability of PK parameters for the same patient over time (intra-individual variability) has also been reported. For example, Zander et al. reported a median intra-individual variability of trough piperacillin concentrations of 30% (range, 6 to 129%) in critically ill patients after only 4 days of treatment. This wide PK heterogeneity in critically ill patients induces considerable variability in antibiotic concentration for a same dose administered. This supports the need for an individualization of the beta-lactam dose in critically ill patients.

### The effects of β-lactam allergy relabeling on antibiotic prescribing practices [^74c41646]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Beta-lactam antibiotic allergy labels are highly prevalent but rarely indicate an allergic intolerance. These patient-reported allergies lead to broad-spectrum antibiotic use, conferred resistance, increased expense, and adverse effects.

Objective

To implement and assess the impact of a history-based clinical guideline that directs antibiotic management and beta-lactam allergy relabeling for patients reporting beta-lactam allergies.

Methods

Patients with beta-lactam allergy labels were identified by our trained multidisciplinary team in diverse clinical settings. This quality improvement project was conducted to evaluate the safety and impact of the guideline on antibiotic use by comparing prescribing practices before and after guideline implementation.

Results

A total of 79 patients with beta-lactam allergies were identified (penicillins-90%, cephalosporins-10%). After guideline implementation, outcomes of allergy relabeling included the following: (1) complete removal, indicating an unlikely true allergy (27%); (2) updated to detail successfully tolerated beta-lactam courses (48%); or (3) no change made to current label (25%). Beta-lactam antibiotic courses before and after guideline implementation compared with total antibiotic courses: allergy removed (44% vs 70%; P < .001), allergy updated (32% vs 68%; P < .001), and no change (27% vs 41%; P = 0.08). Compared with before guideline implementation, beta-lactam antibiotics were 3 times more likely to be prescribed after allergy assessment (odds ratio, 3.22; 95% confidence interval, 2.4–4.3; P < .05).

Conclusion

The implementation of the beta-lactam allergy clinical guideline resulted in most patients' allergy labels being removed or advantageously updated. These allergy label changes correlated with a substantial increase in the percentage of beta-lactam antibiotics prescribed. After guideline implementation, beta-lactam antibiotics had a 3-fold increased odds of being prescribed independent of allergy label outcome.

### Failure of target attainment of β-lactam antibiotics in critically ill patients and associated risk factors: a two-center prospective study (EXPAT) [^0e651aaf]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Target attainment is reported in only 40 to 60% of critically ill patients treated with beta-lactam antibiotics. That said, achieving the high ICU targets is not easy, particularly when conventional beta-lactam dosing regimens are used. Simply increasing the standard dosing for this group of antibiotics in all critically ill patients is not an optimal strategy, since high dosing regimens might result in trough levels associated with overexposure and toxicity. Thus, it appears necessary to individualize beta-lactam dosing regimens in critically ill patients. Accordingly, identifying patients at risk could prompt clinicians to consider more individualized dosing regimens and regular therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).

To our knowledge, only a few other studies have attempted to quantify patient characteristics as potential predictors for beta-lactam antibiotics target attainment in critically ill patients. In some of these studies, limited numbers of patients and/or different beta-lactam antibiotics were investigated, while in only two of these studies, target attainment and relevant factors associated with clinical outcomes were investigated. However, the relationship between target attainment and the clinical outcomes ICU length of stay (LOS) and mortality has not yet been clarified. Therefore, the goals of this study are to determine the prevalence of target attainment of six frequently used beta-lactam antibiotics in ICUs in Europe and to identify risk factors and clinical outcomes associated with target non-attainment.

### Β-lactam vs non-β-lactam antimicrobial prophylaxis and surgical site infection [^f1332d28]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Surgical site infections (SSIs) represent one of the most frequent complications following surgical procedures, contributing to patient morbidity and mortality, extended hospitalization periods, and substantial health care expenditures. To mitigate SSI risk, preoperative surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis (SAP) has become standard practice, with its optimal implementation (choice, dose, timing) requiring careful consideration of both antimicrobial efficacy against potential pathogens and associated adverse effects.,

β-Lactam antibiotics, in particular cefazolin and cefuroxime, are considered first-line agents for SAP for most surgical procedures due to their broad antimicrobial spectrum, bactericidal activity, half-life, and favorable safety profile. However, certain indications necessitate the use of alternative, non–β-lactam prophylactic agents with different mechanisms of action (such as protein synthesis inhibition), most notably in patients with self-reported or documented β-lactam allergies or when mandated by specific institutional guidelines.

The comparative effectiveness of non–β-lactam vs β-lactam SAP in preventing SSIs remains incompletely characterized. While β-lactam antibiotics are preferentially recommended, studies suggest that non–β-lactam alternatives may be associated with elevated SSI rates. Current literature examining this association is limited by small sample sizes, insufficient adjustment for confounding factors, and inadequate longitudinal follow-up. Leveraging the comprehensive data available through our standardized national surveillance system, this study aimed to assess whether non–β-lactam SAP was associated with an increased risk of SSI compared with conventional β-lactam prophylaxis.

### Cross-reactivity in β-lactam allergy [^8924e98c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

β-Lactam drugs (penicillins, amoxicillin, and cephalosporins) account for 42.6% of all severe drug-induced anaphylaxis. In this review, we focus on clinically significant immunologic cross-reactivity in patients with confirmed penicillin allergy to cephalosporins, and the structural involvement of the R 1 and R 2 chemical side chains of the cephalosporins causing IgE-mediated cross-reactivity with penicillin and other cephalosporins. Skin tests predict IgE-mediated reactions and showed cross-reactivity between penicillins and early generation cephalosporins that shared side chains, but confirmatory challenge data are lacking. Later-generation cephalosporins, which have distinct side chains, do not have any skin test cross-reactivity with penicillin/amoxicillin. There is debate as to the involvement of R 2 side chains as the antigenic determinants that cause IgE-mediated hypersensitivity with various cephalosporins. Avoidance of cephalosporins, when they are the drug of choice in a penicillin-allergic individual, results in significant morbidity that outweighs the low risk of anaphylaxis. We conclude that there is ample evidence to allow the safe use of cephalosporins in patients with isolated confirmed penicillin or amoxicillin allergy.

### Β-lactam formation by a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase during antibiotic biosynthesis [^c9082850]. Nature (2015). Excellent credibility.

Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases are giant enzymes composed of modules that house repeated sets of functional domains, which select, activate and couple amino acids drawn from a pool of nearly 500 potential building blocks. The structurally and stereochemically diverse peptides generated in this manner underlie the biosynthesis of a large sector of natural products. Many of their derived metabolites are bioactive such as the antibiotics vancomycin, bacitracin, daptomycin and the β-lactam-containing penicillins, cephalosporins and nocardicins. Penicillins and cephalosporins are synthesized from a classically derived non-ribosomal peptide synthetase tripeptide (from δ-(L-α-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine synthetase). Here we report an unprecedented non-ribosomal peptide synthetase activity that both assembles a serine-containing peptide and mediates its cyclization to the critical β-lactam ring of the nocardicin family of antibiotics. A histidine-rich condensation domain, which typically performs peptide bond formation during product assembly, also synthesizes the embedded four-membered ring. We propose a mechanism, and describe supporting experiments, that is distinct from the pathways that have evolved to the three other β-lactam antibiotic families: penicillin/cephalosporins, clavams and carbapenems. These findings raise the possibility that β-lactam rings can be regio- and stereospecifically integrated into engineered peptides for application as, for example, targeted protease inactivators.

### Penicillin and beta-lactam hypersensitivity [^5f369bee]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Ten percent of patients report penicillin allergy, but more than 90% of these individuals can tolerate penicillins. Skin testing remains the optimal method for evaluation of possible IgE-mediated penicillin allergy and is recommended by professional societies, as the harms for alternative antibiotics include antimicrobial resistance, prolonged hospitalizations, readmissions, and increased costs. Removal of penicillin allergy leads to decreased utilization of broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones and vancomycin. There is minimal allergic cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins. IgE-mediated allergy to cephalosporins is usually side-chain specific and may warrant graded challenge with cephalosporins containing dissimilar R1 or R2 group side chains.

### Allergic cross-sensitivity between penicillin, carbapenem, and monobactam antibiotics: what are the chances? [^cdb51c77]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the literature on the allergic cross-reactivity between penicillin, carbapenem, and monobactam antibiotics.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1950-June 2008) of the English literature was performed using the search terms beta-lactam, penicillin, monobactam, carbapenem, allergy, and cross-reactivity. References of review articles were also screened for inclusion.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles in English from the data source were identified. Studies whose primary goal was to evaluate drug hypersensitivity and the potential for cross-reactivity were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Many patients have reported penicillin allergies that have not been verified by skin testing; many healthcare providers avoid the use of other beta-lactam antibiotics, namely carbapenems, in these patients due to fear of the potential for immunoglobulin E-mediated allergic cross-reactivity. A wide range of cross-reactivity between penicillins and carbapenems has been reported in various studies; however, more recent prospective studies have shown the incidence of cross-reactivity between penicillin and carbapenem skin tests to be around 1%. Additionally, many prescribers freely use the monobactam aztreonam in penicillin-allergic patients, believing there is no cross-reactivity between the 2 drugs. Although data support the lack of cross-reactivity between aztreonam and penicillins, immunology and some clinical data support an interaction between ceftazidime and aztreonam due to the similarity of their side chains.

Conclusions

Although variability in cross-reactivity rates between beta-lactam classes exists in the literature, the practice of avoiding carbapenems in penicillin-allergic patients should be reconsidered. With regard to monobactams, the administration of aztreonam in a patient with a ceftazidime allergy may carry an increased risk of type 1 hypersensitivity reactions and should be considered with caution. Additionally, the importance of obtaining a thorough patient history regarding the previous allergic event, proper documentation, and penicillin skin testing is reemphasized.

### Antibiotic strategies in the era of multidrug resistance [^683b0382]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Mechanisms of resistance

Resistance can occur in all types of pathogens encountered in the ICU setting, although Gram-negative bacteria are the most likely to exhibit resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics. The three most representative mechanisms of resistance to β-lactam antibiotics in Gram-negative bacteria are: destruction of antibiotics by β-lactamases; impermeability, including closure of porin channels in the bacterial cell wall (most notable as the mechanism of resistance to carbapenems for Pseudomonas aeruginosa); and extrusion of antibiotics by efflux pumps (which can lead to resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics). Analogous mechanisms of resistance occur with classes of antibiotics that are increasingly being used to manage infections due to bacteria resistant to β-lactam antibiotics (Table 1). By contrast to β-lactam antibiotics, which have their mechanisms of action and resistance located within the cell wall of the bacteria, the location of binding sites and modifying enzymes of the other antibiotic classes described in Table 1 are intracellular. Knowledge of this variability of action and resistance mechanisms can contribute to informed decisions in the selection of antimicrobial therapy for resistant organisms.

Table 1
Mechanisms of resistance in classes of antibiotics used to treat resistant pathogens

Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) are broad-spectrum enzymes produced most characteristically by E. coli, Klebsiella, and Proteus species (Table 2). Representative of the ease with which resistance can occur, these enzymes may develop on the basis of a change in only one amino acid in the β-lactamases normally produced. Despite the minimal structural change, ESBLs have the capacity to inactivate many broad-spectrum β-lactam drugs. It is noteworthy that use of third-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones has been identified as a risk factor for selection of ESBLs. Of the clinically relevant attributes of these enzymes, ESBLs represent a classic example of a resistance mechanism in which in vitro susceptibility may not be consistently predictive of clinical efficacy.

### Beta lactam antibiotic monotherapy versus beta lactam-aminoglycoside antibiotic combination therapy for sepsis [^bf585c7b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal antibiotic treatment for sepsis is imperative. Combining a beta-lactam antibiotic with an aminoglycoside antibiotic may have certain advantages over beta-lactam monotherapy.

Objectives

We compared clinical outcomes for beta lactam-aminoglycoside combination therapy versus beta lactam monotherapy for sepsis.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2004); MEDLINE (1966 to July 2004); EMBASE (1980 to March 2003); LILACS (1982 to July 2004); and conference proceedings of the Interscience Conference of Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (1995 to 2003). We scanned citations of all identified studies and contacted all corresponding authors.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing any beta-lactam monotherapy to any combination of one beta-lactam and one aminoglycoside for sepsis.

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary outcome was all-cause fatality. Secondary outcomes included treatment failure, superinfections, colonization, and adverse events. Two authors independently collected data. We pooled relative risks (RR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the fixed effect model. We extracted outcomes by intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

We included 64 trials, randomizing 7586 patients. Twenty trials compared the same beta-lactam in both study arms, while the remaining compared different beta-lactams using a broader spectrum beta-lactam in the monotherapy arm. In studies comparing the same beta-lactam, we observed no difference between study groups with regard to all-cause fatality, RR 1.01 (95% CI 0.75–1.35) and clinical failure, RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.95–1.29). In studies comparing different beta-lactams, we observed an advantage to monotherapy: all cause fatality RR 0.85 (95% CI 0.71–1.01), clinical failure RR 0.77 (95% CI 0.69–0.86). No significant disparities emerged from subgroup and sensitivity analyses, including the assessment of patients with Gram-negative and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. We detected no differences in the rate of resistance development. Adverse events rates did not differ significantly between the study groups overall, although nephrotoxicity was significantly more frequent with combination therapy, RR 0.30 (95% CI 0.23–0.39). We found no heterogeneity for all comparisons. We included a small subset of studies addressing patients with Gram-positive infections, mainly endocarditis. We identified no difference between monotherapy and combination therapy in these studies.

Authors' Conclusions

The addition of an aminoglycoside to beta-lactams for sepsis should be discouraged. All-cause fatality rates are unchanged. Combination treatment carries a significant risk of nephrotoxicity.

### Discrepancies in beta-lactam antibiotics cross-reactivity: implications for clinical practice [^23e7bff8]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Using non‐beta‐lactam antibiotics where beta‐lactam antibiotics would suffice has several disadvantages such as higher costs, infection‐treatment failure, prolonged treatment and higher readmittance rates. Furthermore, many publications suggest more post‐operative infections and there is overwhelming evidence that it leads to antimicrobial resistance. Up to now, however, most clinicians find it safer and easier to deviate to second‐line treatment in case of a beta‐lactam allergy, whereas it would be preferable to use an alternative beta‐lactam antibiotic instead.

Although multiple sources have published tables with information regarding cross‐reactivity and safe alternatives within the group of beta‐lactam antibiotics, the disadvantage of these tables is that they are not readily available and identifying a suitable alternative is time‐consuming, especially if patients are allegedly allergic to more than one beta‐lactam antibiotic. A digital tool to choose an alternative beta‐lactam antibiotic could be of added value by preventing unnecessary use of second‐ or third‐line antibiotics.

The general presumption is that the various tables of cross‐reactivity are interchangeable when it comes to safe alternatives, potential risks and high‐risk alternatives. However, in this article, we show that the three most used tables worldwide as well as the recently published Dutch guideline on management in antibiotic allergy not only have internal discrepancies, but the authors also disagree on both safe alternatives in case of (suspected) beta‐lactam allergy and the cause of cross‐reactivity. These discrepancies might lead to hampered clinical outcomes.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections (AmpC beta-lactamase-producing), IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize that several β-lactam antibiotics are at moderate risk of inducing ampC genes. Use both the ability to induce ampC genes and the relative stability of the agent against hydrolysis by AmpC to inform antibiotic decision-making.

R1.3.1. We suggest measuring albumin (or at least plasma proteins) at least once at the onset of treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics in order to guide the prescription.

R1.3.2. We suggest measuring albumin (or at least plasma proteins) when performing beta-lactam TDM in order to help in interpreting the result.

Optional recommendation — strong agreement

The binding of beta-lactams to albumin and plasma proteins determines the free fraction, which is the biologically active fraction that diffuses across biological membranes to tissues. The free fraction is also the fraction that is eliminated by renal and liver clearance. When plasma protein amount decreases, the capacity of beta-lactams to bind to protein decreases and beta-lactam-free fraction increases. Previous studies have shown that the binding of beta-lactams to plasma proteins in ICU patients is highly variable and is more altered for antibiotics highly bound to plasma proteins in conditions of homeostasis (e.g. ceftriaxone, cefazolin, or ertapenem). As a result, plasma concentration of beta-lactam antibiotics may be lowered and more unpredictable in patients with severe hypoalbuminemia. In addition, co-administration of other drugs highly bound to plasma proteins (such as sedative drugs for example) can modify protein binding of beta-lactams. Finally, conformational changes of albumin have been described in ICU patients and may result in an increased or decreased binding to proteins.

However, the relationship between proteins and plasma-free concentration is not straightforward. Firstly, a correlation between the free fraction and albuminemia has been shown for several beta-lactams such as flucloxacillin but is not proven for all beta-lactams. Secondly, although the increase of its free fraction increases beta-lactam antibiotic clearance, it also increases its activity and this change may have little clinical consequence if unbound concentration remains almost unchanged.

As a result, total and free plasma concentration of beta-lactam antibiotics is unpredictable and measuring albumin (or at least plasma proteins) could provide valuable information on the expected pharmacokinetics variability. In addition, as most laboratories currently measure the total beta-lactam concentration, protein and/or albumin level is important to measure at the same time as beta-lactam concentration in order to interpret properly TDM results and decide whether the daily dose of beta-lactam requires adaptation, especially when an intra-patient concentration variability is observed.

### New developments in carbapenems [^0c093611]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Antibiotic resistance among Gram-negative pathogens in hospitals is a growing threat to patients and is driving the increased use of carbapenems. Carbapenems are potent members of the beta-lactam family of antibiotics, with a history of safety and efficacy for serious infections that exceeds 20 years. Original and review articles were identified from a Medline search (1979–2008). Reference citations from identified publications, abstracts from the Interscience Conferences on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy and package inserts were also used. Carbapenems are effective in treating severe infections at diverse sites, with relatively low resistance rates and a favourable safety profile. Carbapenems are the beta-lactams of choice for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms. Optimized dosing of carbapenems should limit the emergence of resistance and prolong the utility of these agents. The newly approved doripenem should prove to be a valuable addition to the currently available carbapenems: imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem.

Cephalosporin allergy management pathways — risk stratification and outcomes: A clinical pathway that incorporates both cephalosporin generation and cephalosporin side chain can help direct safe use of β-lactam in the setting of previously reported hypersensitivity, though outcome data are limited; similar pathways have been implemented to demonstrate cephalosporin tolerance in patients with historical penicillin allergies, and available data indicate increased β-lactam use and first-line antibiotic treatment with reaction rates observed in 0.5%-4.0% of patients.

Since the initial reports of penicillin and beta-lactam drugs causing allergic reactions, much has been elucidated regarding their pathophysiology and mechanism of action. Despite advances in testing for penicillin allergy, with IgE antibodies and skin tests available for the major and minor determinants of penicillin, these reactions remain a challenge to all physicians. They have characteristically been classified according to mechanism and time. Herein, the authors propose a classification system of penicillin allergy based on immunologic mechanisms.

Beta-lactam resistance cassettes

Beta-lactam antibiotics are likely the class of antimicrobials with the highest use to treat infectious diseases, with some of its members classified as last resource antibiotics by the WHO. These molecules affect cell wall synthesis by binding to specific proteins called penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). PBPs are transpeptidases involved in the crosslinking of the peptidoglycan. Beta-lactams can be classified into penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and monocyclic beta-lactams. These antibiotics are used to treat a plethora of infections in many clinical situations.

In our study, we successfully cloned and characterized a total of 19 different gene cassettes, encoding most beta-lactamase classes (Supplementary Table 1). Attending to Ambler´s classification, these included 11 class D enzymes, commonly referred to as oxacillinases (bla OXA); 5 class B enzymes known as metallo-ß-lactamases (bla VIM and bla IMP variants) and 3 cassettes encoding class A enzymes, specifically bla GES, bla BEL, and bla PBL. Applying Bush–Medeiros–Jacobyclassification, we can find 14 enzymes enclosed in group II and 5 group III beta-lactamases in pMBA collection. Given the variety of antibiotics and generations within the family, we performed preliminary diffusion antibiograms to select representative antibiotics from different classes (Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 2). We chose a member of the most clinically-relevant beta-lactam classes for MIC determination, namely amoxicillin (an aminopenicillin), cefaclor and ceftazidime (1st and 3rd generation cephalosporins), ertapenem (a carbapenem), and aztreonam (a monobactam) (Fig. 3).

The study BLISS was published by Mohd H Abdul-Aziz and colleagues in 2016 in the journal Intensive Care Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Sepsis and septic shock. In the BLISS study, the trial question was: what is the role of continuous infusion of β-lactam antibiotics in critically ill patients with severe sepsis not receiving RRT? In the BLISS study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the BLISS study, the population was: 140 patients (44 female, 96 male). The inclusion criteria were critically ill patients with severe sepsis who were not on RRT. The key exclusion criteria were receipt of RRT; impaired hepatic function; receipt of palliative treatment; inadequate central venous catheter access; imminent death. In the BLISS study, the interventions were: n = 70 continuous β-lactam antibiotics (continuous infusion of β-lactam antibiotics) n = 70 intermittent β-lactam antibiotics (intermittent bolus dosing of β-lactam antibiotics). In the BLISS study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in clinical cure at 14 days after antibiotic cessation (56% vs. 34%; AD 22%, 95% CI -0.4 to -0.1). In the BLISS study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the rate of plasma antibiotic concentrations measured at 100% of the dosing interval on day 3 (97% vs. 68%; AD 29%, 95% CI -0.4 to -0.1) No significant difference in ventilator-free days (22 days vs. 14 days; AD 8 days, 95% CI -2 to 18) No significant difference in ICU-free days (20 days vs. 17 days; AD 3 days, 95% CI -3 to 9). In the BLISS study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in 14-day survival and 30-day survival. significant difference in white cell count normalization days (3 days vs. 8 days). In the BLISS study, the conclusion was: in critically ill patients with severe sepsis who were not on RRT, continuous β-lactam antibiotics were superior to intermittent β-lactam antibiotics with respect to clinical cure at 14 days after antibiotic cessation.

### Beta lactam antibiotic monotherapy versus beta lactam-aminoglycoside antibiotic combination therapy for sepsis [^ab991f1f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal antibiotic treatment for sepsis is imperative. Combining a beta lactam antibiotic with an aminoglycoside antibiotic may provide certain advantages over beta lactam monotherapy.

Objectives

Our objectives were to compare beta lactam monotherapy versus beta lactam-aminoglycoside combination therapy in patients with sepsis and to estimate the rate of adverse effects with each treatment regimen, including the development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics.

Search Methods

In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 11); MEDLINE (1966 to 4 November 2013); EMBASE (1980 to November 2013); LILACS (1982 to November 2013); and conference proceedings of the Interscience Conference of Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (1995 to 2013). We scanned citations of all identified studies and contacted all corresponding authors. In our previous review, we searched the databases to July 2004.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing any beta lactam monotherapy versus any combination of a beta lactam with an aminoglycoside for sepsis.

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included treatment failure, superinfections and adverse events. Two review authors independently collected data. We pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the fixed-effect model. We extracted outcomes by intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

We included 69 trials that randomly assigned 7863 participants. Twenty-two trials compared the same beta lactam in both study arms, while the remaining trials compared different beta lactams using a broader-spectrum beta lactam in the monotherapy arm. In trials comparing the same beta lactam, we observed no difference between study groups with regard to all-cause mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.30) and clinical failure (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.29). In studies comparing different beta lactams, we observed a trend for benefit with monotherapy for all-cause mortality (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01) and a significant advantage for clinical failure (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.84). No significant disparities emerged from subgroup and sensitivity analyses, including assessment of participants with Gram-negative infection. The subgroup of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections was underpowered to examine effects. Results for mortality were classified as low quality of evidence mainly as the result of imprecision. Results for failure were classified as very low quality of evidence because of indirectness of the outcome and possible detection bias in non-blinded trials. We detected no differences in the rate of development of resistance. Nephrotoxicity was significantly less frequent with monotherapy (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.39). We found no heterogeneity for all these comparisons. We included a small subset of studies addressing participants with Gram-positive infection, mainly endocarditis. We identified no difference between monotherapy and combination therapy in these studies.

Authors' Conclusions

The addition of an aminoglycoside to beta lactams for sepsis should be discouraged. All-cause mortality rates are unchanged. Combination treatment carries a significant risk of nephrotoxicity.

### Pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics issues relevant for the clinical use of β-lactam antibiotics in critically ill patients [^3f8d0c32]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

New beta-lactam drugs and beta-lactamase combinations

Of great concern is the worldwide increase in the number of infections caused by Gram-negative multidrug-resistant bacteria. Treatment choices for these infections have been limited, especially for infections caused by bacteria that produce carbapenemases and/or extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.

Ceftolozane–tazobactam and ceftazidime–avibactam are 2 beta-lactams/beta-lactamase combinations with anti-Gram-negative bacteria activity that were recently approved for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections, complicated urinary tract infections, and nosocomial pneumonia.

Ceftolozane is an oxyimino-aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a pyrazole substituent at the 3-position side chain instead of the lighter pyridium present in ceftazidime. This heavier side chain provides improved steric hindrance to prevent hydrolysis mediated through AmpC beta-lactamases.

Ceftolozane–tazobactam combines a novel cephalosporin with an established beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor, whereas ceftazidime–avibactam couples a well-known cephalosporin with a novel non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor.

Both tazobactam and avibactam target the active site of serine beta-lactamases. Tazobactam, a beta-lactam sulfone, binds irreversibly to the active site of beta-lactamases and avibactam is a diazabicyclooctane non-beta-lactam that binds covalently and reversibly to beta-lactamases. This reversibility is a unique feature that allows avibactam to undergo recyclization to inactivate another beta-lactamase. The crucial advantage of avibactam is its ability to inhibit extended spectrum beta lactamases, AmpC beta-lactamases (as expressed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae), and class A carbapenemases of the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC and OXA-48) family.

### A large screen identifies β-lactam antibiotics which can be repurposed to target the syphilis agent [^386feba7]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2023). Medium credibility.

It is unclear how well different β-lactams may perform in a clinical setting. But, from the many compounds tested, at least 23 could prevent bacterial growth as indicated by relative efficacy at 5 nM concentration (Figs. 2–4) and a few have even been partially validated through clinical trials. Our iterative sampling approach of β-lactams led to the identification of four penicillin derivatives with MICs ranging from 0.5–1.2 nM (Fig. 4). Mezlocillin and azlocillin were identified as the two β-lactams with the lowest MIC for in vitro cultivated T. pallidum (Fig. 4). Comparative structural similarity analysis predicts that neither would cause an allergic response in penicillin sensitive individuals. Unfortunately, both are no longer produced in the United States. Nafcillin, on the other hand, (1) was very similar to the MIC of benzathine penicillin G; (2) contains a structurally distinct sub-group from benzathine penicillin G; and (3) costs less than other options (Table 1). We note, however, that the cost analysis we provide (Table 1) requires additional considerations for context. First, each value represents bulk pricing and may not reflect patient cost in a clinical care setting. It is also important to consider the number of doses required and the route of administration, which may vary with each treatment. These caveats notwithstanding, Nafcillin is widely available due to its efficacy in treating penicillinase-producing bacteria like Staphylococcal and Streptococcal species. The latter is noteworthy since the only enzymatically characterized T. pallidum PBP, Tp47, is also a penicillinase.

### Discrepancies in beta-lactam antibiotics cross-reactivity: implications for clinical practice [^c981a7f0]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

In patients with a beta‐lactam antibiotic (BA) allergy label, avoidance of the whole group of BAs leads to displacement of first‐line therapies potentially influencing patient outcomes and antimicrobial resistance. Studies previously published on BA cross‐reactivity use different sets of BA and seem to contain conflicting recommendations on safe BA alternatives in case of (suspected) BA allergy.

Methods

The objectives were (i) to identify discrepancies between studies regarding cross‐allergy in BA and (ii) to identify research gaps. The tables and errata of 4 studies (Romano et al. Trubiano et al. Zagursky et al. SWAB‐guideline by Wijnakker et al.) were evaluated and compared head‐to‐head.

Results

A total of 51 antibiotics were covered by the four authors, theoretically leading to 2550 potential recommendations regarding alternatives in case of specific allergies. Internal discrepancies existed in 2 tables. Since none of the tables included all 51 BAs, in 356 situations data were lacking regarding specific alternatives. In 1104 situations, only one author gave advice about a specific alternative. Harmony and disharmony between authors could be evaluated in 1090 cases. The advice regarding alternative BAs was 696 times in harmony (482 safe, 214 unsafe), while discrepancies were found in 394 cases. This led to a different advice (safe vs. unsafe) in 272 cases or 69%.

Conclusion

Disharmony between authors was identified in 36% of the cases. In 69%, this led to a clinically relevant, different advice. This indicates the need for synchronisation of cross‐reactivity tables and answering remaining research gaps.

### Practical aspects of choosing an antibiotic for patients with a reported allergy to an antibiotic [^ea47b77a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Physicians often must select antibiotics for patients who are reported to have an antibiotic allergy. For penicillins, the sensitivity of penicillin skin testing for predicting serious allergic reactions is excellent. For other beta-lactam antibiotics, penicillin skin testing is useful for excluding the possibility of sensitivity to the beta-lactam ring. For other antibiotics, the patient history remains the most useful tool for determining whether a serious reaction is likely to occur with further drug exposure. The cross-reactivity between penicillins and second- or third-generation cephalosporins (excluding cefamandole) is probably no higher than is the cross-reactivity between penicillins and other classes of antibiotics. When a patient has a suspected immunoglobulin E-mediated antibiotic allergy, desensitization therapy should be considered, if the efficacy of alternate antibiotics is in doubt. For the treatment of serious infections, it is usually possible to safely administer the antibiotic of choice despite a history of possible antibiotic allergy.

### Back to the future: using aminoglycosides again and how to dose them optimally [^4d6f7ac8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Gram-negative organisms have become increasingly resistant to both beta-lactam antibiotics and fluoroquinolones. Consequently, aminoglycoside antibiotics have undergone a resurgence in use. Because of the known toxicities of aminoglycoside antibiotics, clinicians have avoided their use, unless no other alternatives were extant. Over the past 2 decades, we have learned much about the relationship between aminoglycoside exposure and the likelihood of a good clinical outcome or the occurrence of nephrotoxicity. For example, minimum inhibitory concentration values ≥ 2.0 mg/L lead to unacceptably low probabilities of a good clinical outcome, and infrequent administration of doses (i.e., intervals of 24 h and longer intervals for patients with compromised renal function) plays a central role in minimizing the likelihood of toxicity. Using these new insights, we suggest ways of evaluating the dose and schedule of administration of aminoglycosides in empirical therapy to obtain the highest likelihood of an efficacious and nontoxic therapy.

### Treatment for infections with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae: what options do we still have? [^b0e0ca3b]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

None of the antimicrobials currently in development has activity against the entire spectrum of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria. The mortality associated with the failure rates from the current salvage therapies highlighted above is disconcerting. The treatment of serious infections with CRE remains an enormous challenge. A concerted global commitment to the intelligent use of antimicrobials, better antibiotic stewardship, the implementation of effective infection control strategies, and the development of more effective therapies are desperately needed.

### Beta-lactam versus β-lactam-aminoglycoside combination therapy in cancer patients with neutropenia [^05653e36]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Continued controversy surrounds the optimal empirical treatment for febrile neutropenia. New broad-spectrum beta-lactams have been introduced as single treatment, and classically, a combination of a beta-lactam with an aminoglycoside has been used.

Objectives

To compare beta-lactam monotherapy versus beta-lactam-aminoglycoside combination therapy for cancer patients with fever and neutropenia.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 7, 2012), LILACS (August 2012), MEDLINE and EMBASE (August 2012) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (Issue 3, 2012). We scanned references of all included studies and pertinent reviews and contacted the first author of each included trial, as well as the pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any beta-lactam antibiotic monotherapy with any combination of a beta-lactam and an aminoglycoside antibiotic, for the initial empirical treatment of febrile neutropenic cancer patients. All cause mortality was the primary outcome assessed.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data concerning all cause mortality, infection related mortality, treatment failure (including treatment modifications), super-infections, adverse effects and study quality measures were extracted independently by two review authors. Risk ratios (RRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. Outcomes were extracted by intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis whenever possible. Individual domains of risk of bias were examined through sensitivity analyses. Published data were complemented by correspondence with authors.

Main Results

Seventy-one trials published between 1983 and 2012 were included. All cause mortality was lower with monotherapy (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.02, without statistical significance). Results were similar for trials comparing the same beta-lactam in both trial arms (11 trials, 1718 episodes; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.06) and for trials comparing different beta-lactams－usually a broad-spectrum beta-lactam compared with a narrower-spectrum beta-lactam combined with an aminoglycoside (33 trials, 5468 episodes; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.09). Infection related mortality was significantly lower with monotherapy (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.99). Treatment failure was significantly more frequent with monotherapy in trials comparing the same beta-lactam (16 trials, 2833 episodes; RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.20), and was significantly more frequent with combination therapy in trials comparing different beta-lactams (55 trials, 7736 episodes; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.97). Bacterial super-infections occurred with equal frequency, and fungal super-infections were more common with combination therapy. Adverse events were more frequent with combination therapy (numbers needed to harm 4; 95% CI 4 to 5). Specifically, the difference with regard to nephrotoxicity was highly significant. Adequate trial methods were associated with a larger effect estimate for mortality and smaller effect estimates for failure. Nearly all trials were open-label. No correlation was noted between mortality and failure rates and these trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Beta-lactam monotherapy is advantageous compared with beta-lactam-aminoglycoside combination therapy with regard to survival, adverse events and fungal super-infections. Treatment failure should not be regarded as the primary outcome in open-label trials, as it reflects mainly treatment modifications.

### Beta-lactam dosing in critically ill patients with septic shock and continuous renal replacement therapy [^69231c84]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Optimal antibiotic dosing in the ICU is still a controversial issue that clinicians face daily. Despite compelling evidence supporting early and appropriate antibiotic therapy as one of the most effective interventions for improving patient outcome, antibiotic selection and dosing is often challenging in critically ill patients because of disease complexity, resulting physiological alterations, and reduced antibiotic susceptibilities of nosocomial pathogens. Besides, selecting an antimicrobial to which the causal agent is susceptible is not sufficient to achieve the best clinical outcomes, and factors such as adequate tissue penetration and achievement of a pharmacodynamic target associated with therapeutic success according to the antibiotic class are crucial for improving infection cure and patient morbi-mortality.

Beta-lactam antibiotics are time-dependent antibiotics, meaning that they exhibit optimal killing activity when plasma concentrations are maintained above the minimum inhibitory concentration of the bacteria during a percentage of the dosing interval (%T > MIC). Beta-lactams are also the most prescribed antibiotics in the ICU. Significant and unpredictable pharmacokinetic variability of this pharmacological group has been well documented in critically ill patients: the volume of distribution (Vd) and the clearance (CL) of beta-lactams have been found to vary significantly depending on patient severity, proteinemia and organ failure, among other factors. Acute kidney injury and the requirement of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) add further variability to beta-lactam CL. However, available clinical evidence supporting beta-lactam dosing in critically ill patients with septic shock and CRRT is not yet optimal, since recommendations are mainly elucidated from healthy volunteers' data and from clinical studies with important patient variability and limited sample sizes.

The aims of this article are to describe the current clinical scenario of beta-lactam dosing in critically ill patients with septic shock and CRRT, to highlight the sources of variability among the different studies that reduce extrapolation to clinical practice, and to identify the opportunities for future research and improvement in this field. For this purpose, two of the most frequently prescribed beta-lactams for nosocomial infections (meropenem and piperacillin) and a highly protein-bound antibiotic usually prescribed for community-acquired infections (ceftriaxone) were chosen for a thorough review. A systematic review of all available data on beta-lactam antibiotic pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients with CRRT was beyond the scope of this article, as this has been done elsewhere.

### Where will new antibiotics come from? [^54a8e2d1]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2003). Medium credibility.

There is a constant need for new antibacterial drugs owing to the inevitable development of resistance that follows the introduction of antibiotics to the clinic. When a new class of antibiotic is introduced, it is effective at first, but will eventually select for survival of the small fraction of bacterial populations that have an intrinsic or acquired resistance mechanism. Pathogens that are resistant to multiple drugs emerge around the globe, so how robust are antibiotic discovery processes?

### Model-informed precision dosing of β-lactam antibiotics and ciprofloxacin in critically ill patients: a multicentre randomised clinical trial [^0fef6f1d]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Timely and appropriate antibiotic treatment is vital in treating critically ill patients. Beta-lactam antibiotics and fluoroquinolones are among the most prescribed antibiotics in the intensive care unit (ICU). The pharmacokinetic (PK) behaviour of these antibiotics is different than in non-critically ill patients and subject to fast and significant changes over time. Consequently, only 60% of patients receiving beta-lactam antibiotics and 30% of patients receiving ciprofloxacin achieve the adequate pharmacodynamic target (PDT). Not achieving the PDT is associated with poorer chances of clinical cure, bacteriological eradication, and an increased chance of antimicrobial resistance development. Preventing resistance development is important as resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and fluoroquinolones account for more than 70% of deaths attributable to antimicrobial resistance.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign advises precision dosing to optimise and individualise dosing strategies of antimicrobials based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) principles. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), an individualised dosing strategy based on assessments of serum drug levels, has been proposed as a method to optimise exposure. TDM increases target attainment of some beta-lactam antibiotics and potentially leads to better outcomes. Model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) is an emerging approach for TDM-guided dosing that addresses the limitations of traditional TDM, such as the need to wait for steady-state concentrations. Using population PK models and integrating TDM results, MIPD can assess the probability of target attainment for different dosing regimens. Therefore, MIPD could help to optimise dosing of beta-lactams and ciprofloxacin.

The effect of MIPD or TDM on clinical outcomes, especially in critically ill patients, has been scarcely studied in randomised clinical trials (RCT). The primary aim of this trial was to assess whether early MIPD using pharmacometric modelling of beta-lactam antibiotics and ciprofloxacin decreases ICU length of stay (LOS) compared to standard dosing.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers (R. P. M. A. A.) independently extracted relevant information from all included studies using a customized data extraction form. The following information was collected from each study: study center, design, year, location, sample size, patient demographic, type of interventions, predominant site of infection, type of pathogen, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), type of beta-lactam, dose, dosing interval, type of infusion, dose adjustments, number of TDMs performed per patient, target attainment, dosing algorithm, use of concomitant antibiotics, primary and secondary outcomes, definitions used, and illness severity measures (eg, inflammatory markers, disease severity scores).

Risk of Bias Assessment

Two review authors (R. P. M. A. A.) independently assessed the risk of bias for each randomized, controlled trial (RCT) using the Cochrane risk of bias evaluation. Risk of bias plots for RCTs were generated using the robvis tool. The Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS) was applied to evaluate the quality of any observational studies. The scale ranges from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating higher quality. Studies were assessed according to the criteria outlined in Supplementary File 2, Supplementary Table 1. Studies that scored 3 to 4 in the selection domain, 1 or 2 for comparability, and 2 or 3 for outcomes were deemed to be of "good quality." We therefore chose a cutoff of ≥ 6 for good-quality studies. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third review author (A. A. U.).

Outcomes

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality (at 28 days or longest follow-up). Secondary outcomes were clinical cure (resolution of signs and symptoms of sepsis or as defined by the study), treatment failure (as defined by the study), microbiological cure (clearance of organism from blood culture or site of infection or as defined by the study), hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS), target attainment (as defined by each individual study; target attainment was evaluated only in studies that reported beta-lactam concentration measurements in both intervention and control groups), antibiotic-related adverse events (acute kidney or liver injury; gastrointestinal, neurological, and hematological adverse events; and allergic reactions), and emergence of new antimicrobial resistance (as defined by the study). The definitions of clinical, microbiological, and biochemical improvement are summarized in Supplementary File 2, Supplementary Table 2.

### Insufficient β-lactam concentrations in the early phase of severe sepsis and septic shock [^0af51490]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The treatment of infections in the critically ill patient remains a significant challenge for clinicians. Standard first doses of broad-spectrum β-lactams provided inadequate levels to achieve target serum concentrations for extended periods of time in critically ill patients with sepsis. Improved characterization of the pharmacodynamic properties of these antimicrobials may lead to revisions in recommendations on dosing in severe infections, especially in the early phase of severe sepsis and septic shock.
