## Question

does umbilical hernia get starngulated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether umbilical hernias can get strangulated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions of incarceration versus strangulation. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology that makes strangulation possible. Next, I will quantify risk in children versus adults, including special populations like those with cirrhosis or pregnancy. After that, I should review clinical signs and diagnostic thresholds that warrant emergent surgery. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified answer and outline management implications with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate terms. Incarceration means the hernia contents are irreducible, whereas strangulation means the blood supply to those contents is compromised, risking ischemia and necrosis; this distinction is critical because strangulation is a surgical emergency, whereas incarceration alone may not be if the patient is stable and the hernia is not tense or ischemic [^f5764934] [^571a9bf1].

> Now, I need to check the pathophysiology to ensure the mechanism is plausible for umbilical hernias. A narrow hernia neck can compress bowel or omentum, impairing venous outflow first and then arterial inflow, leading to ischemia, necrosis, and perforation; this sequence is well described for ventral hernias, including umbilical defects, and explains why delays in treatment increase morbidity and the need for bowel resection [^f5764934] [^571a9bf1].

> Next, I should review pediatric data to quantify risk. In children, large cohorts show that incarceration and strangulation are rare: a 2621-patient series reported 33 incarcerations and only 2 strangulations, yielding a strangulation rate around 0.08%, and systematic reviews estimate complication rates of 0.16%–0.81% for incarceration or strangulation; this supports expectant management until 4–5 years of age in asymptomatic children, with spontaneous closure common [^be6f346c] [^b2280882] [^7c96ad82] [^a1449be0].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; adult risk is different. In adults, umbilical hernias are acquired and more often symptomatic or complicated. Emergency repair rates are higher, and strangulation does occur, particularly with narrow-necked or "mushrooming" hernias; the hernia-to-neck ratio (HNR) greater than 2.5 has been associated with a markedly increased risk of emergent repair and complications, reflecting the mechanical vulnerability of a small neck relative to a large sac [^d9d5b8db] [^aaeb4836].

> I should confirm special high-risk populations. In cirrhosis with ascites, umbilical hernias are common and prone to skin breakdown, rupture, and strangulation; emergency surgery in this group carries high morbidity and mortality, so elective repair after optimization is preferred when feasible, and any signs of skin ulceration or necrosis warrant urgent surgical consultation [^8923bee9] [^de580b5b]. Pregnancy can also precipitate acute presentations, including strangulation, necessitating emergent operative management when suspected [^05a9792c].

> Let me consider clinical recognition and diagnostics. Strangulation presents with severe pain, tenderness, erythema or skin discoloration, systemic signs such as tachycardia or fever, and laboratory evidence of ischemia such as elevated lactate; when the diagnosis is uncertain or the exam is limited, contrast-enhanced CT can identify ischemic bowel, mesenteric edema, or free air and guide urgency, but I should double-check that imaging should not delay operative care when strangulation is clinically suspected [^f5764934] [^5195b59b] [^26a76181].

> I will now examine management implications to ensure the answer is actionable. In children, given the very low strangulation risk, observation to age 4–5 years is standard unless the hernia is symptomatic, rapidly enlarging, or has skin changes; in adults, elective repair is generally advised for symptomatic hernias or those with risk features, and any suspicion of strangulation mandates emergent exploration with assessment of bowel viability and definitive hernia repair, often without mesh if contamination is present [^a1449be0] [^f5764934] [^5195b59b].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, umbilical hernias can become strangulated, but the risk is very low in children and higher in adults, especially with narrow-necked hernias, cirrhosis with ascites, or pregnancy; recognizing signs early and proceeding to emergent surgery when strangulation is suspected prevents bowel necrosis and reduces morbidity, whereas routine pediatric umbilical hernias can be safely observed unless complications arise [^be6f346c] [^d9d5b8db] [^8923bee9] [^571a9bf1].

Umbilical hernias can **strangulate** when the herniated bowel or omentum loses its blood supply due to a tight hernia neck, causing ischemia and necrosis. This is a **surgical emergency** [^d668f8f2] requiring urgent repair to prevent bowel loss, sepsis, and death [^f5764934]. Strangulation is rare in children (about 0.08–0.81%) [^b2280882] [^be6f346c] but more common in adults, especially with obesity, chronic cough, constipation, or ascites [^05a9792c]. Early signs include severe pain, a firm, tender, nonreducible mass, skin discoloration, vomiting, and systemic toxicity; prompt surgical evaluation is essential [^5195b59b].

---

## Pathophysiology of umbilical hernia strangulation

Strangulation occurs when the hernia neck constricts the contents, **compromising blood flow** and causing ischemia, necrosis, and perforation if untreated [^f5764934]. Risk increases with a narrow hernia neck, large hernia size, or high intra-abdominal pressure from obesity, chronic cough, constipation, or ascites [^d9d5d8db].

---

## Incidence and risk factors

- **Pediatric population**: Strangulation is rare (0.08–0.81%) [^b2280882]; most umbilical hernias resolve spontaneously or are repaired electively [^a1449be0].
- **Adult population**: Higher risk due to acquired factors (obesity, chronic cough, constipation, ascites) [^8923bee9]; strangulation is a recognized complication requiring emergency surgery [^d668f8f2].
- **Special populations**: Cirrhosis with ascites [^8923bee9] and pregnancy [^e7bf26d6] markedly increase strangulation risk and mortality.

---

## Clinical presentation

Strangulation presents with:

- **Severe pain**: Sudden, intense hernia-site pain.
- **Nonreducible mass**: Firm, tender, nonreducible hernia.
- **Skin changes**: Erythema, cyanosis, or necrosis over the hernia.
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, obstipation.
- **Systemic signs**: Fever, tachycardia, hypotension, sepsis.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, supported by imaging when needed:

- **Physical examination**: Nonreducible, tender hernia with skin changes and systemic toxicity [^5195b59b].
- **Ultrasound**: Initial modality to assess contents and vascular compromise [^notfound].
- **CT scan**: Gold standard for bowel ischemia, obstruction, or perforation [^26a76181].

---

## Management and treatment

Strangulation is a **surgical emergency** [^d668f8f2]; delays increase morbidity and mortality [^5195b59b]:

- **Immediate surgical exploration**: Reduce hernia, assess bowel viability, and repair the defect [^5195b59b].
- **Bowel resection**: If necrotic segments are present [^f5764934].
- **Mesh use**: Controversial in contaminated fields; biologic mesh may be considered [^6032d79e] [^1342afe8].
- **Perioperative care**: Antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and close monitoring [^4cffe5d9].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis depends on promptness of intervention and patient factors. Early surgery yields good outcomes, whereas delays cause **high morbidity** — including bowel necrosis, sepsis, wound infection, and recurrence [^f5764934] [^5ae1e81e]. Mortality is higher in elderly, comorbid, or cirrhotic patients [^notfound].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on **risk reduction** and timely repair:

- **Weight management**: Reduce obesity-related intra-abdominal pressure [^notfound].
- **Chronic cough control**: Treat respiratory conditions [^notfound].
- **Constipation management**: Dietary and pharmacologic measures [^notfound].
- **Elective repair**: For symptomatic or large hernias, especially in adults [^34e73480].

---

Umbilical hernias can **strangulate**, most often in adults with risk factors; it is a surgical emergency with significant morbidity if not treated promptly. Early recognition and immediate surgical intervention are critical to prevent bowel necrosis, sepsis, and death [^d668f8f2].

## References

### Predictors of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia in children [^c5e515e6]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Results from this study demonstrate that pediatric umbilical hernias are unlikely to become strangulated or incarcerated. The probability of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia decreases with an increase in defect size while controlling for prematurity and other comorbidities. On the other hand, probability of non-resolution increases with prematurity. In light of these findings, factors such as prematurity and increasing defect size should continue to be considered during the management of children with umbilical hernia in Ontario. Because umbilical hernias are usually a benign condition with a very low complication rate, family physicians should encourage parents to monitor their child's condition until 4–5 years of age while being cognizant of any potential complications. Overall, conservative management is justifiable and appropriate during pediatric monitoring of asymptomatic umbilical hernia.

In conclusion, we aimed to characterize the probability of spontaneous resolution for umbilical hernia in our Eastern Ontario cohort. Overall, our study determined that the odds of spontaneous resolution were lower for premature babies and were negatively correlated with defect size. As such, continued monitoring of defect size and prematurity is warranted during umbilical hernia management of children in Ontario.

### Management of asymptomatic pediatric umbilical hernias: a systematic review [^7c96ad82]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Uncomplicated pediatric umbilical hernias are common and most close spontaneously. No formal practice guidelines exist regarding the optimal timing and indications for repair. The objective of this review is to examine the existing literature on the natural history of pediatric umbilical hernias, known complications of repair and non-operative approaches, and management recommendations.

Study Design

A systematic literature search was performed to identify publications relating to pediatric umbilical hernias. Inclusion criteria comprised studies addressing recommendations for optimal timing of repair, evidence examining complications from hernias not operatively repaired, and research exploring the likelihood of pediatric umbilical hernias to close spontaneously. In addition, the websites of all pediatric hospitals in the United States were examined for recommendations on operative timing.

Results

A total of 787 manuscripts were reviewed, and 28 met criteria for inclusion in the analysis. Studies examined the likelihood of spontaneous closure based on child's age and size of hernia defect, complications of unrepaired umbilical hernias including incarceration, strangulation and evisceration based on child's age and size of defect, incidence of postoperative complications and current recommendations for timing of repair. In addition, 63 (27.5%) of the United States pediatric hospital websites published a wide range of management recommendations.

Conclusion

Despite the high prevalence of pediatric umbilical hernias, there is a paucity of high quality data to guide management. The literature does suggest that expectant management of asymptomatic hernias until age 4-5years, regardless of size of hernia defect, is both safe and the standard practice of many pediatric hospitals.

### Predictors of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia in children [^b2280882]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric umbilical hernias affect approximately 10%–30% of live births annually. This rate decreases between 2% and 10% after 1 year, with nearly 90% umbilical hernias resolving spontaneously within the first few years of life. Presently, expectant management, or watchful waiting, is the current medical guideline for monitoring umbilical hernias until children reach 4–5 years of age. Complications that may occur include incarceration and strangulation. The rate of these complications is quite low (0.16%–0.81%). There is no consensus regarding appropriate timing of surgical repair or indications for surgery by any of the major pediatric associations (eg, Canadian Association of Pediatric Surgery, American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Pediatric Surgical Association or the American College of Surgeons). A better understanding of the natural history of uncomplicated umbilical hernias, management and treatment outcomes is required. Additionally, there is minimal evidence on risk factors affecting the likelihood of spontaneous resolution in children. An in-depth analysis of various parameters influencing clinical outcomes, such as spontaneous resolution, has not been elucidated extensively, or at our institution. Therefore, the aim of this study was to conduct a retrospective chart review on the surgical outcomes of all patients with umbilical hernia treated at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO), Canada. The objective was to describe factors of spontaneous resolution, clinical outcomes, such as rate of recurrence, and complications.

### WSES guidelines for emergency repair of complicated abdominal wall hernias [^98f46ecb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

A large number of abdominal hernias require emergency surgery. However, these procedures are associated with poor prognoses and a higher rate of post-operative complications.

A World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) Consensus Conference was held in Bergamo on July 2013, during the 2 nd Congress of the World Society of Emergency Surgery with the goal of defining recommendations for emergency repair of abdominal wall hernias in adults. This document represents the executive summary of the consensus conference approved by a WSES expert panel.

Abdominal hernias may be classified as groin hernias (femoral and inguinal) and ventral hernias (umbilical, epigastric, spigelian and incisional).

An incarcerated hernia may be defined as a hernia in which the contents have become irreducible due to a narrow opening in the abdominal wall or adhesions within the cavity. Intestinal obstruction can complicate an incarcerated hernia. In contrast, a strangulated hernia is one in which the blood supply to the contents of the hernia (eg omentum, bowel) s becomes compromised.

Strangulated hernias remain a significant challenge, as they are sometimes difficult to diagnose purely by physical examination yet require urgent surgical intervention. Early surgical intervention of a strangulated hernia with obstruction is crucial as delayed diagnosis can lead to bowel resection with longer recovery and its attendant complications. Strangulated hernias can have serious deleterious effects such as, bowel obstruction, bacterial translocation, and intestinal wall necrosis (potentially resulting in bowel perforation). It poses a significant risk to emergency hernia repair, as there is an increased incidence of surgical field contamination, leading to high rates of post-operative infection and probably recurrence.

Bacteria inherently colonize all surgical wounds, but only a fraction of these contaminates ultimately lead to infection. In most patients infection does not occur because innate host defences are able to eliminate microbes at the surgical site. However, there is some evidence that the implantation of foreign materials, such as prosthetic mesh, may lead to a decreased threshold for infection.

Discussion

This study sought to examine the clinical outcomes and complications of umbilical hernias as well as to identify factors for spontaneous resolution among children. In our study population, nearly half experienced spontaneous resolution of hernia by 4–5 years of age. The low rate of strangulation and incarceration suggests that if left untreated, umbilical hernia may resolve by itself. The low rate of perioperative complications (n = 33; 1.26%) and reoccurrence (n = 20; 0.76%) further suggests that repair is a safe procedure, even after 4–5 years of age. These findings are consistent with a recent American study, which stated that the rate of preoperative complications in umbilical hernia (eg, incarceration, strangulation, and evisceration) were low, occurring in approximately 1 in 1500 hernias. Overall, our study findings suggest that patients with asymptomatic umbilical hernia can be followed up safely by their family physician until 4–5 years of age, at least at our institution. Caution should be exercised when generalizing our results to other institutions across Canada.

Our study demonstrated that for every 1 mm increase in defect size, the odds of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia decreased by 5%. Despite 89.1% of hernias closing spontaneously at age 6, a study conducted by Walker and colleagues found that larger hernias were also less likely to close; in fact, 0% (0/21) with a defect > 1.5 cm were closed by 6 years of age. In contrast, hernia prevalence may decrease with increasing age, indicating that the majority of large hernias may close by ages 3–4 without the need for surgery. Although not statistically significant in our study, prior literature attests that comorbidities, such as childhood obesity, may impact the likelihood of spontaneous closure. Interestingly, in our study, 40% of men and 38.7% of women had spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia; however, when examining results of the logistic regression, this difference based on gender is not statistically significant. In other words, at least in our sample, there is no difference in frequency of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia among men versus women.

Results

A total of 2621 patients with umbilical hernias were eligible and reviewed for inclusion in this study. Table 1 provides an overview of patient characteristics. Half (51%) were women. Mean age at first referral was 2.9 ± 3.0 years. Of the total sample size, 970 children had pre-existing comorbidities, including cardiac, genetic, neurological, and nephrological disorders. Of the patients encountered, 39.5% experienced spontaneous closure. The remainder went on to have a surgical repair.

Table 1
Characteristics of study population (n = 2621)

The median size of defect was 7 mm. Perioperative complications (eg, infection, bleeding, anesthesia-related complications) occurred in 12 cases. There were 20 (0.75%) instances of recurrence, with a median age of 4.2 years at recurrence. There were 37 children over the age of 10 years who had an umbilical hernia while undergoing surgery for unrelated conditions, which was an incidental finding and was thus removed from the analysis to eliminate any potential for bias towards spontaneous resolution of hernia. There were missing data for defect size in 1257 participants, which had to be excluded in the binary logistic regression analysis.

Complications

A total of 33 patients experienced incarceration and two experienced strangulation in this group (table 2). Age at referral for this subgroup was slightly higher, at a median of 3.8 years. There were no operative complications; however, the size of defect was greater (median 10 mm). Recurrence occurred in one case.

Table 2
Characteristics of patients with complication (n = 33)

Characteristics of patients at high risk of complications

The number of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia events totaled 1031 (table 3). Premature babies were found to be 80% less likely to have spontaneous resolution of hernia compared with non-premature babies [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.20; 95% confidence interval (Cl) 0.03 to 0.74] (table 3). Additionally, for every millimeter increase in defect size, the odds of spontaneous resolution was 5% lower while controlling for gender, prematurity, and presence of comorbidities (aOR 0.95; 95% Cl 0.93 to 0.97).

Incarcerated hernias

Abdominal wall hernias are another common cause of intestinal obstruction in LMICs, as loops of intestine can become trapped, incarcerated, and subsequently strangulated within these abdominal wall defects.

Umbilical hernias are especially common in Africa. Umbilical hernias can occur in 91% of children 5 years or younger and 46% of children who are 10–15-year-old. In the United States, umbilical hernias occur in 40–60% of infants and only 4% remain present after the age of 5, while the remaining spontaneously close. In general, umbilical hernias should be repaired by 5 years of age if the defect does not obliterate spontaneously. In single center studies, incarceration from an umbilical hernia can occur in 37–44% of patients presenting to the hospital with symptoms.

In Africa, inguinal hernias are present in 1–5% of children overall and in 35% of premature babies. In the United States, the condition has a similar prevalence of 1–5% in children overall and a lower prevalence at 9–11% in premature infants. Similar incidence rates exist in Asia, where inguinal hernias occur in 6.6% of males and 0.7% of females in a nationwide Taiwanese population study. Given the heightened risk of incarceration, early elective herniotomy is the treatment of choice after diagnosis of a reducible inguinal hernia.

Elective herniotomy is usually a short outpatient case and is extremely cost-effective. However, surgical backlog or compromised access to surgical care frequently prevents timely repair of these defects, which leads to a high incidence of incarcerated and strangulated hernias in LMICs. In a Nigerian study, obstructed hernias made up 14.8% of all abdominal surgical emergencies, ranking third after typhoid ileal perforation and intussusception. Inadequate surgical capacity to accommodate elective cases prevents early surgical correction of this common condition, leading to preventable morbidity that necessitates emergent repair.

### Outcomes following repair of incarcerated and strangulated ventral hernias with or without synthetic mesh [^5ae1e81e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Ventral hernias include all hernias arising from a defect in the anterior abdominal wall as epigastric, umbilical, and incisional hernias. Ventral hernias are susceptible for various complications, particularly incarceration and strangulation, that warrant urgent operative intervention which is usually associated with high rates of postoperative recurrence and complications.

The diagnosis of incarceration/strangulation on the verdict of clinical examination alone is not an easy task. Strangulation should be recognized in a timely manner as it warrants immediate surgical intervention. Early operative intervention for strangulated hernia is crucial since any delay in the diagnosis can lead to further compromise of the bowel viability and eventually bowel resection. In addition to the risk of anastomotic leak after bowel resection and anastomosis, strangulation increases the contamination of the operative field which subsequently increases the incidence of postoperative surgical site infection (SSI) and hernia recurrence.

The World Society for Emergency Surgery (WSES) has issued a grade 1A recommendation for the use of synthetic mesh repair in the cases of incarcerated ventral hernia without signs of bowel strangulation or concurrent intestinal resection. On the other hand, owing to the increased likelihood of SSI in the cases of strangulated hernias with concomitant bowel resection, synthetic mesh repair should be used with caution in these circumstances (grade 2C recommendation).

The use of prosthetic mesh in potentially-contaminated and contaminated settings is not frequently described in the literature. Despite the wide variations of data and the conflicting reports, prosthetic materials are not generally recommended for the repair of ventral hernias in contaminated settings. Choi and colleagues used the records of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program of the United States and evaluated the prosthetic repair of strangulated ventral hernia for more than 33,000 patients in clean-contaminated and contaminated settings. The authors reported that clean-contaminated cases had a significantly higher incidence of wound disruption, and superficial, and deep SSIs along with significantly increased odds for complications overall.

Xourafas et al. evaluated the feasibility of using a synthetic mesh in ventral hernia repair with simultaneous bowel resection. The authors found a significantly higher incidence of postoperative SSI in patients treated with prosthetic mesh compared to those treated without mesh (22 vs 5%).

The present study aimed to review the outcomes following the repair of incarcerated and strangulated ventral hernias with or without synthetic mesh in compliance with the established clinical guidelines of WSES in terms of the incidence of SSI and recurrence of hernia postoperatively.

### Evidence-based, cost-effective management of abdominal wall hernias: an algorithm of the journal of trauma and acute care surgery emergency general surgery algorithms work group [^d668f8f2]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

This algorithm developed by the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery emergency general surgery (EGS) algorithms working group addresses the initial evaluation and management of ventral abdominal wall and groin hernias presenting in the emergency setting. The algorithm is intended to serve as a bedside reference for clinicians. It is annotated with letters linked to corresponding text that provides the rationale and references to support these recommendations. The algorithm is not a substitute for the clinical judgment and experience of bedside clinicians and should not be considered as the "standard of care". We encourage institutions to use these recommendations to formulate local protocols but recognize that there are patient-specific factors and institutional resource availability that may require deviation from this algorithm.

Abdominal wall hernia includes ventral hernias (umbilical, incisional, epigastric, spigelian) and groin hernias (inguinal, femoral). While the majority of abdominal wall hernias are treated in the elective setting, there is a subset of patients who present to the emergency department (ED) with acute issues, including severe pain, intestinal obstruction, incarceration, and strangulation. Emergency surgery may be required for patients with an abdominal wall hernia, with an incidence of 16 to 19 emergent hernia repairs per 100,000 person-years. Presentation with acute hernia incarceration (inability to reduce hernia contents) warrants prompt repair, and concern for strangulation (compromise of blood supply to the contents), particularly bowel ischemia, is a surgical emergency that requires prompt intervention to avoid the increased morbidity associated with delay in definitive management. Identifying strangulation can be a clinical challenge as physical examination, laboratory, and imaging findings can be nonspecific. Therefore, the evaluation of patients with abdominal wall hernia in the emergency setting and the decision to proceed with operative intervention should be made using a systematic approach.

### Efficacy of adhesive strapping on umbilical hernia in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies [^56cca268]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric umbilical hernia (UH) is a common disease that occurs in 10%–20% of newborns. Despite its high prevalence, 80% of patients with UH are expected to heal spontaneously before reaching 1 year of age and 90% before 2 years of age without any treatment.

Since the mid-20th century, adhesive strapping (AS), which involves strapping the abdomen with adhesive tape to keep the UH reduced, has been considered a useful method, and several studies and case reports regarding this maneuver have been published. However, as studies on its usage became limited, its efficacy was doubted and AS became obsolete. Therefore, in most countries, children are under observation for UH until the age of 2 years. Surgical repair is considered when UH persists beyond that age.

In Japan, AS has been recently reconsidered a standard procedure. This is because some studies have revealed that AS accelerates healing and suppresses umbilical protrusion after hernia closure. However, its efficacy is still unclear because there are no randomized controlled trials; several cohort studies have investigated the strategy. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to reveal the efficacy of AS for UH compared with observation-only management by analyzing previous cohort studies.

Herein, the primary outcome was the change in the UH closure rate. The secondary outcomes were the closure rate at 6 months of age, among patients with a large hernia, among mature or premature infants, and the rate of children with umbilical protrusion with redundant skin at the end of the observation period. We examined the closure rates with data in recent studies and reviewed the complications of AS.

### Multi-tissue transcriptome-wide association study identifies novel candidate genes and pleiotropy effects across four abdominal hernia subtypes [^5c29feae]. HGG Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal hernias occur when weakened abdominal wall muscles allow organs or tissues to protrude, leading to severe complications including bowel obstruction and strangulation. The prevalence of abdominal hernias differs across hernia subtypes, with inguinal hernias comprising 75% of abdominal hernia cases, followed by other subtypes, including ventral (15%), umbilical (5%), and femoral (3%) hernias. To date, little is known as to why these differences in prevalence exist. Understanding the biological mechanisms through which abdominal hernias develop is critical for early intervention and prevention of this common condition.

Several demographic, clinical, and behavioral risk factors have been reported for abdominal hernias, and importantly, individuals with a family history are at a greater risk for developing abdominal hernias compared with individuals with no family history. Array-based heritability estimates have shown a stronger contribution of genetic risk factors for umbilical hernia (16.0%) compared with inguinal (12.0%), ventral (7.0%), or femoral (6.0%), suggesting different etiology according to the hernia subtype. To date, 81 independent genetic loci have been associated with different forms of hernia, and 26 loci were associated with more than one hernia subtype. Especially, we have previously conducted a multiethnic meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of inguinal hernia, combining results from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) and the UK Biobank (UKB) cohorts, and identified 63 genome-wide significant loci (p < 5 × 10⁻⁸).

### Predictors of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia in children [^398dc62a]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

After obtaining approval from our institution's research ethics board (REB), we performed a retrospective chart review in EPIC (Electronic Health Records). Hyperspace of all patients referred for umbilical hernia to CHEO between January 1990 and April 2017.

Study participants were identified from patient records, based on the diagnostic code for umbilical hernia obtained from the CHEO Clinical Research Unit. We included all children under 18 years of age who were referred to CHEO for umbilical hernia repair during the designated capture period, which explained how our study sample size was obtained. Umbilical hernia repair refers to the procedure whereby a surgeon makes a small incision at the base of a patient's belly button and pushes the loop of bowel back into the abdominal wall. Exclusion criteria were: (1) young adults > 18 years of age and (2) children with umbilical hernia who were discovered as an incidental finding while undergoing surgical procedure for another condition. Medical records for all patients identified were reviewed and abstracted. Data were compiled into The Research Electronic Data Capture Database (REDCap).

Variables extracted from medical records included date of birth, gender, age at first referral, size of defect (mm), comorbidities (any cardiac, genetic, neurological, and nephrological disorders), dates of resolution (day, month, year), incarceration, and/or strangulation, date of surgery, and any perioperative complications. The main outcome of interest was spontaneous resolution of hernia. One potential confounder is prematurity, defined as gestational age less than 37 weeks. To eliminate the potential for confounding, we excluded patients with an incidental finding of umbilical hernia from our study.

Descriptive statistics were performed for age, timing of repair, and complications. Binary logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of preoperative complications (incarceration/strangulation) and odds of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia, in an attempt to identify a cohort that would benefit from earlier surgical repair. A subgroup analysis was performed exclusively on patients with complications, due to the presence of effect modification between umbilical hernia and resolution of the hernia.

### Umbilical hernia repair: overview of approaches and review of literature [^e7c8bc4e]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Umbilical hernias are ubiquitous, and surgery is indicated in symptomatic patients. Umbilical hernia defects can range from small (< 1 cm) to very large/complex hernias, and treatment options should be tailored to the clinical situation. Open, laparoscopic, and robotic options exist for repair, with each having its advantages and disadvantages. In general, mesh should be used for repair, because it has been shown to decrease recurrence rates, even in small hernias. Although outcomes are generally favorable after umbilical hernia repairs, some patients have chronic complaints that are mostly related to recurrences.

### 2017 update of the WSES guidelines for emergency repair of complicated abdominal wall hernias [^f5764934]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

A large number of abdominal hernias require emergency surgery. However, these procedures may be associated with poor prognosis and a significant rate of postoperative complications.

Abdominal hernias may be classified as groin hernias (femoral or inguinal) and ventral hernias (umbilical, epigastric, Spigelian, lumbar, and incisional).

An incarcerated hernia is a hernia in which the content has become irreducible due to a narrow opening in the abdominal wall or due to adhesions between the content and the hernia sac. Moreover, intestinal obstruction may complicate an incarcerated hernia. A strangulated hernia occurs when the blood supply to the contents of the hernia (e.g. omentum, bowel) is compromised. Strangulated hernias remain a significant challenge, as they are sometimes difficult to diagnose by physical examination and require urgent surgical intervention. Early surgical intervention of a strangulated hernia with obstruction is crucial as delayed diagnosis can result in the need for bowel resection with prolonged recovery and increased complication rate. Strangulated hernias may lead to bacterial translocation and intestinal wall necrosis (potentially resulting in bowel perforation). This condition significantly increases the risks in emergency hernia repair that may lead to an increased incidence of surgical site contamination and recurrence.

An interesting topic is the use of laparoscopy in emergency hernia repair. However, its role in acute settings is not well established yet.

Bacteria inherently colonize all surgical wounds, but not all of these contaminations ultimately lead to infection. In most patients, infection does not occur because innate host defences are able to eliminate microbes at the surgical site. However, there is some evidence that the implantation of foreign materials, such as prosthetic mesh, may lead to a decreased threshold for infection.

While many factors can influence surgical wound healing and postoperative infection, bacterial burden is the most significant risk factor. According to the likelihood and degree of wound contamination at the time of operation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) wound classification stratifies the wound as follows:
Class I = clean wounds
Class II = clean-contaminated wounds
Class III = contaminated wounds
Class IV = dirty or infected wounds (Table 1)

### An unusual "hernia": losing a stone is not always a good thing! [^e89941fa]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

A 42-year-old woman presented to the surgical outpatient department with what appeared to be a strangulated recurrent paraumbilical hernia. She was taken to theatre, where exploration revealed an unexpected diagnosis: an abdominal wall abscess that had formed around what appeared to be a gallstone dropped at the umbilical port site of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed 10 years previously. The abscess was incised and drained and a connection with the abdominal cavity excluded. The patient made a full recovery. Complications relating to spilled gallstones are rare, but can present in a variety of ways and sometimes many years after the original surgery. They should always be considered in a patient with a history of cholecystectomy presenting with an abdominal wall mass. There is no clear evidence of the best imaging modalities to be used for investigation. Methods for reducing the risk of such complications and the principles of different treatments are discussed.

Indications for treatment: dependence on size of defect or hernia sac, hernia type, symptoms, and age

Thomas Simon

A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Medline, the Cochrane Library, and the Study Register, as well as a search of relevant journals and reference lists including publications until 6 June 2012. The following search terms were used in the search strategy: "operation" AND "watchful waiting" AND ("Hernia" [Mesh]) OR "Hernia; Abdominal" [Mesh] OR "Hernia; Ventral" [Mesh] OR "Hernia; Umbilical" [Mesh] OR ("Abdominal wall hernias") OR ("ventral hernia") OR ("epigastric hernia") OR ("incisional hernia") AND (randomized controlled trial[pt] OR controlled clinical trial[pt]). The search produced 462 hits including inguinal hernias. Of the 42 relevant papers found, 28 were selected for this analysis. The only two level 1b trials addressed inguinal hernias and were included with intention to discuss the existing evidence in a related field. Regarding data addressing ventral and incisional hernias, only one level 3 study and 15 level 4 uncontrolled studies were found.

Statements

Recommendations

No precise data on the incidence and prevalence of ventral and incisional hernias are available. An epidemiologic study showed an increasing proportion of midline abdominal wall hernias, with a relative frequency of 19% for umbilical/par umbilical hernias, 8.6% for epigastric hernias, and 4.8% for incisional hernias [78]. The incidence for incisional hernia is 10–20% [79, 80], making it one of the most common surgical complication after laparotomy.

Ventral and incisional hernias are treated with surgery to relieve symptoms (pain and discomfort), to prevent complications (strangulation, respiratory dysfunction, or skin problems), or to resolve acute complications (incarceration and strangulation) [95].

### Minimally invasive repair of recurrent strangulated umbilical hernia in cirrhotic patient with refractory ascites [^e70b644b]. Liver Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

To repair a recurrent strangulated umbilical hernia in a cirrhotic patient with refractory ascites, we used a minimally invasive procedure. The laparoscopic repair included a release of the incarcerated small bowel loop and secure of a dual Gortex mesh onto the fascial rim. Our satisfactory long-term results should encourage surgeons to adapt this surgical approach.

### Repair of umbilical and epigastric hernias [^14b366a2]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Umbilical and epigastric hernias are primary midline defects that are present in up to 50% of the population. In the United States, only about 1% of the population carries this specific diagnosis, and only about 11% of these are repaired. Repair is aimed at symptoms relief or prevention, and the patient's goals and expectations should be explicitly identified and aligned with the health care team. This article details some relevant and interesting anatomic issues, reviews existing data, and highlights some common and important surgical techniques. Emphasis is placed on a patient-centered approach to the repair of umbilical and epigastric hernias.

### Spontaneous bowel evisceration through umbilical hernia in an adult non-cirrhotic patient [^05a9792c]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

An UH is a ventral midline hernia located at or near the umbilicus, from 3 cm above to 3 cm below it, according to the classification of the European Hernia Society. In the general population, UH has a prevalence of approximately 2%, and about 175 000 UH repairs are annually performed in the United States. As opposed to the paediatric population, where congenital UH is one of the most common conditions, in adults it is acquired in approximately 90% of the cases. Accounting for 6%–14% of all abdominal wall hernias in adults, UH is second only to inguinal hernias for incidence.UHs can contain preperitoneal fat, omentum and small bowel, or a combination of these. The spontaneous rupture of the hernia sac is a sporadic occurrence, and concomitant evisceration is even rarer, especially in non-cirrhotic patients. Complications of untreated UH include bowel incarceration or strangulation, spontaneous rupture with ascitic fluid leakage in cirrhotic patients (the dreadful so-called Flood Syndrome, and evisceration). If such complications arise, the mortality rate is high despite surgical repair. The development of UH is more common in people with increased intra-abdominal pressure, such as in pregnancy, obesity, ascites or chronic abdominal distension, all of which contribute to stretching of the abdominal muscle fibres and weakening of the connective tissue (figure 3). Interestingly, one of the two previously reported spontaneous SBE through an UH in a non-cirrhotic patient was an overweight woman in her fifth pregnancy. Cirrhotic patients with persistent ascites will develop UH in approximately 20% of the cases, due to an increase in the abdominal pressure from ascites, dilation of umbilical veins and muscular or connective tissue weakness due to poor nutritional status, or even in up to 40% of the cases in large-volume ascites. Body positioning and patient activity can exert added pressure on the intra-abdominal cavity, potentially compromising the weakened anterior abdominal wall layers. Skin discolouration, ulceration, ascitic leakage and rapid increase in hernia size are indicators of an impending rupture. Straining during bowel movements, coughingand physical exertionare all activities that have been associated with SBE through UH. In our case, the patient complained of skin rupture following a sudden cough. As it has been previously reported twice in the literature, it is important to note that the patient did not exhibit clinical signs of cirrhosis with ascites. Instead, we diagnosed him serologically with a previously unidentified HCV infection that was not associated with cirrhosis or ascites. It is likely that the sustained increase in intra-abdominal pressure due to obesity, his probable malnutrition along with his injection drug addiction, together with the sudden increase due to coughing, caused the hernia sac rupture and evisceration in our patient. Surgery is the only definitive treatment for UH, with an expected 1%–5% recurrence and complication rates, especially in patients with obesity or uncontrolled refractory ascites. A recent systematic review reports a recurrence between 2.7% and 27% in mesh repair and non-mesh repair, respectively. Usually, the neck of such umbilical defects is narrower than their herniated sacs, increasing the likelihood of incarceration and strangulation of their contents. These occurrences may require emergency repairs, thereby increasing the morbidity and mortality of UHs compared with inguinal hernias. Although in the past some advocated for a 'watchful waiting' approach considering the approximately 1% risk of strangulation per year of UH, due to the severity of its potential complications, each case must be carefully evaluated. Indeed, only asymptomatic UH with no aesthetic compromise should be non-operatively treated. According to D'Orazio et al, in cases where the skin above an UH ruptures without evisceration, a conservative approach using glue injection may provide a beneficial temporary alternative to surgery. This approach can serve as a bridge therapy, affording more time to optimise the patient's clinical condition. Nevertheless, it is always advisable to undertake early elective repair of UH, because a conservative approach could necessitate emergency surgery for ensuing complications, which would ultimately increase the patient's risk. In urgent and emergent settings, the safest approach is primary closure with sutures, as the use of a mesh would increase the risk of infection and potential serious and life-threatening complications despite decreasing the rate of recurrence. Several authors, reporting their experience managing similar patients, highlight that inserting a prosthesis, when feasible, lowers the incidence of hernia recurrence, and it is widely accepted in today's literature that a mesh repair carries a lower risk of recurrence. Shankar et al advocate for elective UH repair with mesh to be always considered also in patients with multiple comorbidities as it offers partial protection from recurrence without significant morbidity. The sublay technique can be used in the elective situation, when feasible, showing a lower rate of infection and recurrence. In our case though, we opted for direct repair of the defect due to the significant contamination of the operative field following intestinal resection. Regarding the size of the defect, Kaufmann et al have concluded that even in defects of less than 4 cm, there is a higher rate of recurrence with primary repair. Therefore, the use of a mesh should always be considered. Primary risk factors for postoperative complications and recurrences are obesity, liver disease and ascites, diabetes, primary suture repair without mesh and smoking. Factors such as obesity, which is often associated with diabetes, as well as persistent ascites in advanced cirrhosis, contribute to an elevated intra-abdominal pressure that keeps suboptimal tissues under tension. Therefore, strict and proper control of ascites in cirrhotic patients, as well as general attention to weight management and smoking cessation, are crucial to reduce the rate of recurrence and complications after UH repair.

### Variation in surgical management of asymptomatic umbilical hernia at freestanding children's hospitals [^2e6cebb0]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To examine hospital-level variation in the timing of asymptomatic umbilical hernia repair in children.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of children undergoing umbilical hernia repair at 38 children's hospitals using the Pediatric Health Information System database (01/2013–12/2017). Early repair was defined as surgery performed at 3 years of age or younger. Repairs were categorized as emergent/urgent if associated with diagnostic or procedural codes indicating obstruction or strangulation, or if they occurred within 2 weeks of an emergency department encounter. Multivariable regression was used to calculate hospital-level observed-to-expected (O/E) ratios for early repair adjusting for emergent/urgent repair and patient characteristics.

Results

23,144 children were included, of which 30% underwent early repair (hospital range: 6.9%-54.3%, p ≪ 0.001). Overall, 3.8% of all repairs were emergent/urgent, and higher rates of early repair did not correlate with higher rates of emergent/urgent repair across hospitals (r = -0.10). Following adjustment, hospital-level O/E ratios for early repair varied 8.9-fold (0.19–1.70, p ≪ 0.001).

Conclusion

Timing of asymptomatic umbilical hernia repair varies widely across children's hospitals, and the magnitude of this variation cannot be explained by differences in patient characteristics or the acuity of repair. Many children may be undergoing repair of hernias that may spontaneously close with further observation.

Level Of Evidence

Level III (retrospective comparative study).

### Management of hernias in pregnancy [^56002710]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Even though groin and umbilical hernias are rare in adult women, the rarer cases of pregnant women presenting with hernias create distinct challenges to treatment planning. The course of hernias in pregnant women, the effect of hernias on delivery, and the timing of elective herniorrhaphy have not been established. To date, there have been no published series establishing that postpartum repair of umbilical and groin hernias that develop in pregnancy is safe and acceptable.

Study Design

From September 2004 to July 2006, 12 female patients with groin or umbilical hernias occurring during pregnancy presented to a single surgeon at the Mount Sinai Medical Center. All patients later underwent postpartum herniorrhaphy and were enrolled retrospectively. All patients underwent either open umbilical or inguinal hernia repair primarily or using a plug-and-patch method (Bard Mesh PerFix Plug; Davol) in an ambulatory setting. Mean longterm followup was 17 months.

Results

Mean age of the patients was 35 years (range 27 to 41 years). The most common type of hernia was inguinal (58%). The predominant side was right (86%). None of the patients had an associated diagnosis or clinically significant medical history. All patients were evaluated, operated, and followed up by the same surgeon. Neither incarceration nor strangulation occurred in any patient before or after delivery. None required hospitalization or emergent hernia repair. Patients did not experience any delivery complications. All patients underwent elective postpartum open hernia repair with sedation and local anesthesia (4 to 52 weeks postpartum; mean 22 weeks postpartum). No patient experienced any perioperative or postoperative complications. None of the patients experienced a hernia recurrence. Four patients had subsequent uncomplicated pregnancies.

Conclusions

This series lends support to the "watchful waiting" strategy during pregnancy, with a plan for postpartum herniorrhaphy. Elective, postpartum hernia repair provides similar results to the nonpregnant population.

### Ultrasound-guided rectus sheath block, caudal analgesia, or surgical site infiltration for pediatric umbilical herniorrhaphy: a prospective, double-blinded, randomized comparison of three regional anesthetic techniques [^14b0dca3]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Umbilical hernias develop commonly in infants and reach a maximal size by the first month of life. They make up 14% of abdominal hernias and occur in approximately one of six children. The incidence decreases to 2–10% in children older than 1 year of age, and while most umbilical hernias close spontaneously before this time, the incidence of incarceration or strangulation may be as high as 10–20%. Although umbilical herniorrhaphy is a common pediatric outpatient surgical procedure, it may be associated with significant postoperative pain. Historically, the mainstay of pediatric analgesia has been opioid-based therapy. While this approach is generally safe, its potential for adverse effects has prompted the use of alternative analgesic methods in infants and children. Although caudal epidural blockade has been the most commonly used pediatric regional anesthetic technique, effective analgesia in a variety of circumstances is possible with the use of peripheral nerve blockade even in children.–Additionally, peripheral nerve blockade may have a lower incidence of adverse effects when compared with neuraxial techniques, including caudal epidural analgesia.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^60ceebf2]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Indication related to size

The systematic search provided only one article on defect size and outcome [96]. Moreno-Egea et al. performed a prospective study without a control group that excluded hernias smaller than 5 cm in diameter and those with "Swiss cheese" defects. The data analysis showed that size correlates with recurrence, and these authors recommended restriction of the laparoscopic approach to a hernia size of 10 cm or smaller (level 4). A retrospective single-center study of 302 patients who underwent open repair of primary incisional hernia analyzed several risk factors for recurrence and demonstrated that the size of the hernia is a significant risk factor for recurrence [97].

Asymptomatic hernias

The search found no publications on the natural history of the condition. One long-term prospective study and one review showed 60% of patients with incisional hernias to be symptom free [80, 81]. An international questionnaire among hernia specialists showed a rate of 23% for asymptomatic cases, and more than 20% of the patients did not undergo operative repair. The strangulation/incarceration rate was 5% [82]. The group concluded that there are no hard data describing the natural course of an incisional hernia. Their current view is that patients with asymptomatic incisional hernias should be undergo surgery to avoid complications.

Precise data on the strangulation rate or the risk for acute incarceration of incisional hernias are unavailable. One small prospective case study reported an emergency operation rate of 3.2% [103]. The data from the Danish Ventral Hernia Database published by Helgstrand et al. [84] showed an acute hernia rate of 10%, with umbilical hernias showing the highest rate (57%). No controlled studies have investigated the increase in size of incisional hernias over time, the risk factors for strangulation, or the development of discomfort and pain.

A prospective case study involving consecutive patients investigated whether patients obtain pain relief from surgery [103]. This study found no benefit regarding pain for patients with minimal symptoms. Two prospective trials have been launched to address this question relating to the indication for surgery among asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic incisional patients. The multicenter AWARE trial of Lauscher et al. [104] is the multicenter study in the recruiting phase and the second trial that has completed intake and data collection but has not been published to date [105]. Hence, no conclusive data exist currently, but the issue is likely to be resolved with publication of the results from the two trials.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^8923bee9]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of umbilical hernia in patients with ascites

In the cirrhotic patient, the incidence of abdominal wall hernia is 16% and reaches 24% in the presence of ascites; more than half of these are umbilical hernias. These progressively enlarge and are prone to complications, including ulceration of the overlying skin, incarceration, strangulation, and rupture. Non-operative management of complicated hernias with antibiotics and dressing changes might result in mortality rates in the range of 60–88%. On the other hand, hernia repair in cirrhosis has often been avoided due to high postoperative morbidity and mortality. Emergency surgery (OR = 10.32, 95% CI 3.66 to 47.82), Child-Pugh-Turcotte class C (OR = 5.52, 1.67 to 32.45), American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score ≥ 3 (OR = 8.65, 3.65 to 87.23) and MELD score ≥ 20 (OR = 2.15, 2.71 to 32.68) are associated with mortality.

A recent retrospective series of 102 patients, who underwent surgical repair of the umbilical hernia in the presence of ascites, included 45 patients having emergency surgery (24 with incarceration, 12 with rupture of the hernia sac, and nine with skin ulceration or necrosis). Morbidity and mortality rates of 37.2% and 3.9%, respectively, were observed. Optimising management of ascites, including LVP and TIPSS perioperatively, could reduce the risk of wound dehiscence and recurrence of hernia.

Recommendations

Suitability and timing of surgical repair of umbilical hernia should be considered in discussion with the patient and multidisciplinary team involving physicians, surgeons and anaesthetists. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)

### Imaging the postoperative patient: long-term complications of gastrointestinal surgery [^26a76181]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Fig. 6
a – c Patient with bowel ischemia secondary to a strangulated obstruction. Gas inside the mesenteric veins (arrowheads in b) coming from a bowel segment that also presents intramural gas (curved arrows in a, b) after perforation of a gangrenous bowel wall are seen. Portal venous gas (arrows in c) and pneumoperitoneum (stars in a, c) are also evident

Clinical and laboratory differentiation between simple obstruction and incarceration/ strangulation is very difficult, and treatment delay is a major prognostic factor for increased morbidity and poor survival. CT is extremely useful in discriminating between these two entities, and it plays an instrumental role in determining appropriate patient treatment (medical versus surgical). Findings of closed-loop obstruction should result in close monitoring, and if clinical symptoms persist, early surgery is suggested. In patients in whom signs of strangulation are already evident, emergency surgery is mandatory.

External hernias

An incisional hernia is a type of external hernia caused by an incompletely healed surgical wound. Typically, peritoneal fat, with or without incorporation of bowel loops, protrudes through the hernial defect (Figs. 7 and 8e).

Fig. 7
a, b Patient with an incisional external hernia. A cluster of fluid and air-filled dilated bowel loops is found inside the hernial sac on the right flank (stars). Narrowing of the afferent and efferent ends of the closed loop at the site of hernial neck can also be appreciated — the beak sign (arrows in a). Stretching of the mesenteric vessels is seen on the coronal reformation (arrowhead in b)

### Age-dependent costs and complications in pediatric umbilical hernia repair [^3f09e1b0]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To characterize regional variation in the age of patients undergoing umbilical hernia repair to determine costs and subsequent care.

Study Design

We performed a cross-sectional descriptive study using a large convenience sample of US employer-based insurance claims from July 2012 to December 2015. We identified children younger than 18 years of age undergoing uncomplicated (not strangulated, incarcerated, or gangrenous) umbilical hernia repair as an isolated procedure (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision procedure codes 53.41, 53.42, 53.43, or 53.49, International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision procedure code 0WQF0ZZ, or Current Procedural Terminology procedure codes 49580 or 49585).

Results

In all, 5212 children met criteria for inclusion. Children younger than age 2 years accounted for 9.7% of repairs, with significant variation by census region (6% to 14%, P < .001). Total payments for surgery varied by age; children younger than 2 years averaged $8219 and payments for older children were $6137. Postoperative admissions occurred at a rate of 73.1 per 1000 for children younger than age 2 years and 7.43 for older children; emergency department visits were 41.5 per 1000 for children younger than age 2 years vs 15.9 for older children (P < .001).

Conclusions

Umbilical hernias continue to be repaired at early ages with large regional variation. Umbilical hernia repair younger than age 2 years is associated with greater costs and greater frequency of postoperative hospitalization and emergency department visits.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for inguinal hernia, more specifically with respect to terminology, HSG 2023 guidelines recommend to use the following terminology for groin hernias:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Acutely irreducible hernia|- A hernia in which the contents cannot be reduced on physical examination but were previously reducible before the acute onset of symptoms|
|Chronically irreducible hernia|- A long-standing hernia in which the contents cannot be reduced on physical examination and is not associated with sudden onset of new symptoms|
|Strangulated hernia|- A hernia with strangulated content which can only be described as such after the diagnosis is confirmed by preoperative imaging or intraoperative findings.|

### Inguinal hernia in premature infants [^da7cb87b]. NeoReviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Inguinal hernia is a common problem affecting infants in the NICU. As a group, preterm infants have the highest incidence of inguinal hernia and this risk increases as gestational age decreases. The etiopathologic factors leading to the development of an inguinal hernia are not clear and interventions to alter these factors have not been thoroughly investigated. Diagnosis of an inguinal hernia is often straightforward, but occasionally it may be difficult to determine if the hernia is strangulated or simply obstructed. Rarely, investigative modalities, such as ultrasonography, may be needed to rule out other potential causes. The ideal timing of surgical repair in this population is unknown and complicated by comorbid conditions and limited randomized controlled trials. During surgery, the choice of regional versus general anesthesia requires a team-based approach and studies have found that greater clinical experience is associated with lower morbidity. The techniques of hernia surgery range from open to laparoscopic repair and have been investigated in small prospective studies, while larger databases have been used to analyze outcomes retrospectively.

### Prospective analysis of outcomes in umbilical hernia repair for patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^1593bc38]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

It has been estimated that more than 10% of cirrhotic patients will require surgery other than liver transplantation or hepatocellular carcinoma resection, on either an emergent or an elective basis. Several factors, such as the severity of liver disease, the type and the urgency of surgery, and the risks of general anesthesia, are critical determinants of the outcomes. Even in cases of elective surgery, such as cholecystectomy, colectomy, coronary artery bypass grafting and abdominal aortic aneurysm, mortality rates have been found to be up to 3.4–8 times greater in patients with compensated cirrhosis, and up to 22.7 times higher for cirrhotics with portal hypertension. Emergency abdominal surgery in cirrhotic patients has been associated with a 3-month mortality rate up to 30% and a reduction in postoperative survival of more than 50% at 1 year.

Umbilical hernias present in about 20% of cirrhotic patients, rising to 40% in those with ascites. Malnutrition, severity of liver dysfunction, previous hernia repair and emergency procedures (e.g. strangulation, incarceration, evisceration of bowel, perforation, leakage, soft tissue ulceration) are strongly related to complications and higher mortality rates. When considering elective repair, effective control of ascites and nutrition improvement are proposed as key factors for a better outcome. In selected cases with portal hypertension and uncontrolled ascites, preoperative transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement has been proposed as a bridging strategy.

A few decades ago, patients were discouraged from proceeding even to an elective herniorrhaphy, in order to avoid post-surgical complications. However, recent studies suggest that elective umbilical hernia repair (UHR) is preferable to conservative management, as the latter is associated with unexpected complications — mainly a decompensated state — and a greater likelihood of severe adverse outcomes, including death.

Nevertheless, robust scientific data are lacking to establish clear recommendations regarding the exact timing and patient profile for choosing early elective UHR over a "wait and watch" approach. The aim of this study was to assess prospectively the short-term and long-term outcomes of decompensated cirrhotic patients with ascites who underwent either elective (for symptomatic patients) or emergency UHR, and to identify the risk factors associated with these outcomes.

Results

Study selection

In total, 129 studies were identified through database searching and manual searching (figure 1). After removing duplicates, two reviewers identified eligible articles independently by title and abstract screening. Studies that did not meet our inclusion criteria were removed, and 12 studies were assessed for eligibility. After excluding articles with no English abstract and insufficient data, finally, 10 studies were included in our analysis (figure 1).

Figure 1
Flow chart of the selection of eligible studies.

Study characteristics and quality assessment

The general characteristics of the included studies are shown in tables 1 and 2. The 10 included studies were cohort studies: 4 articles from Europe, Australia, and the USA were published in the mid-20th century, and 6 articles from Japan were published after 2000. AS was commenced before the age of 1 year in all cases, particularly during the first 6 months of life. The observation periods were at least 12 months. The qualities of the eligible studies were assessed using the NOS, which suggested that they were of high quality: a score of 7 in five studies and a score of 8 in five studies (online supplemental file 2).

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^c2e0ac45]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Symptoms

The study found seven publications dealing with symptoms, including two database studies [84] and one a questionnaire study [82]. A large study with a long-term follow-up period (≤ 10 years) including 564 patients, showed that 11% of patients experience an incisional hernia, with 33% having symptoms and 14% experiencing obstruction [80]. In a retrospective review of 959 patients after liver transplantation, Vardanian et al. [83] found an incisional hernia rate of 4.6%, with 78% of the hernias being symptomatic (pain and discomfort) and 5% presenting with incarceration or strangulation. In the series of Courtney et al. [86], 78% of the patients underwent surgery because of pain, whereas 10% presented acutely [87], and in the series published by Hjaltason, umbilical hernias were incarcerated five times more often than incisional hernias.

Acute hernia

Emergency repairs of acute abdominal hernia are associated with a high morbidity rate [81, 88, 93]. In patients managed by a "watchful waiting" strategy, Davies et al. reported a significant proportion who presented with acute hernia. The series of Alani et al. comprised an interestingly high rate of acute ventral hernia amounting to almost 50% of the prospectively reviewed population. As a percentage of all the hernias managed by surgery during the study period, the 12.2% incidence of acute ventral hernias still is high [89]. Regarding pediatric umbilical hernia, a retrospective review of 489 children showed a 7% rate of presentation with acute hernia [90]. Earlier studies showed an incarceration rate of 14.6% and a strangulation rate of 2.4% [91].

Age

Only one retrospective study providing level 4 evidence and involving 155 patients addressed the question whether advanced age is a contraindication for laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. The study population was divided in two groups based on a threshold at 65 years. The authors did not find any significant difference regarding morbidity and mortality [92]. The Cochrane Review [106] comparing laparoscopic and open surgical techniques for ventral and incisional hernia repair showed a clearcut and consistent reduced risk for SSI in the laparoscopic group, and this review has had a great impact on hernia surgery among the elderly.

### A febrile infant with abdominal erythema and irritability [^a2e7e858]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Case Report

A 37-day-old male was evaluated in the emergency department for 24 hours of fever to 102°F, abdominal erythema, and irritability. The patient was also reported to have 10 days of watery, gray stools on an appropriate diet of generic formula and breastmilk. The patient was the product of a full-term pregnancy and a C-section delivery due to breech positioning with no perinatal complications.

On initial assessment, the patient was febrile to 38.6°C, tachycardic to 190 bpm, tachypneic to 70 breaths/minute with normal oxygen saturations and blood pressure. He was fussy and difficult to console, and he had obvious erythema of the umbilical and periumbilical region (Figure 1). The abdomen was diffusely tender to palpation with gross distension. A small umbilical hernia was irreducible with patient straining.

Figure 1.
Physical exam of patient's abdomen showing periumbilical erythema and mild umbilical hernia. The patient's abdomen was also distended and tender to palpation.

Pertinent laboratory findings included a normal complete blood count and complete metabolic profile, C-reactive protein of 10.7 mg/dL (ref.: 0.0–1.0 mg/dL), and procalcitonin of 1.47 ng/mL (ref.: < 0.05 ng/mL). Urinalysis was unremarkable, urine and blood cultures were drawn, and an attempted lumbar puncture was unsuccessful.

Plain films demonstrated diffuse gaseous distension of bowel throughout the abdomen without dilated loops of bowel. Intraluminal gas extended to the rectum. No appreciable free intraperitoneal air, pneumatosis, or portal venous gas was noted. Abdominal ultrasound showed hyperemic soft tissue with surrounding inflammatory stranding and a small amount of fluid with mild hyperemia of the bowel near the site of the herniation suggestive of an incarcerated umbilical hernia without strangulation. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) (Figure 2) suggested a central abdominal wall hernia containing loops of small bowel with associated mild mucosal hyper-enhancement and thickening, potentially concerning for strangulation/incarceration, but without evidence of bowel obstruction. Alternatively suggested was a small fluid collection related to an infected umbilicus.

### Minimally invasive approach to incarcerated or strangulated groin hernias: a 2018 EAST master class video presentation [^0d4c5d25]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Groin hernia repair is one of the most common general surgical procedures performed worldwide. Although only a small percentage will become incarcerated or strangulated, this is an indication for repair. Minimally invasive surgery is becoming the standard of care for most procedures, and we believe this to be a safe and feasible approach for incarcerated or strangulated groin hernias. We present a description of our recommended approach with technical details and accompanying video clips to highlight these techniques.

### Efficacy of adhesive strapping on umbilical hernia in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies [^b4d01226]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Prematurity is regarded as a factor for UH because there is a difference in UH prevalence between mature and premature infants. We did not find articles that compared the UH closure rates by maturity, but Kurobe et al reported that the closure rates among mature and premature infants who were treated with AS at the end of the study were 85.7% and 80%, respectively. Although they seemed different, it was unclear whether closure rates would change if the corrected age was used.

AS was implemented mainly in the mid-20th century and after the year 2000. Particularly in Japan, AS was reconsidered as a practical treatment for UH because many retrospective studies indicated its positive effects on UH closure. The discontinuation rate of AS was reported to be approximately 10%, and skin irritation due to plasters and tape is one of the determinants in deciding whether to continue AS. Since more skin-friendly plasters and tapes have been developed, we expected that the AS completion rate would rise and increase the successful UH closure rate with a lower complication rate. In our study, however, the comparison of the AS group with the observation group on UH closure among recent studies, all published in Japan, did not show a significant difference.

The most severe complications of UH are strangulation, incarceration, and evisceration, but their occurrence rates are considered low. Therefore, based on the prevention of these complications, AS has few advantages for patients. If AS is applied for earlier closure or the prevention of redundant skin, AS-related complications should be taken into consideration. The most common problem was skin irritation or dermatitis from a plaster, which was the most decisive factor regarding AS continuation. However, these skin problems were relatively prevented using skin-friendly plasters and films or by introducing a short refraining period. Other complications reported in Japanese literature were massive bleeding from the umbilical artery, strangulation due to compression, and UH perforation caused by skin ulceration, which were all reported as case reports. One study reported that AS caused delayed UH closure and increased severity, but other articles did not report similar events. Despite the low prevalence, doctors need to explain these possibilities and pay attention to the umbilical condition when changing AS.

### Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair: early follow-up of a randomized controlled study of primary fascial closure before mesh placement [^a1b83de8]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ventral hernias are defects in the abdominal wall which can be classified as primary (umbilical and epigastric) or incisional (after surgery). Ventral hernias are sometimes asymptomatic, but more often they cause a variety of symptoms ranging from mild discomfort and pain to incarceration and even life-threatening strangulation. A cornerstone in hernia repair has been 'tension-free' hernioplasty, which was introduced and popularized in inguinal hernia surgery by the Lichtenstein group in 1984. Proponents of this approach argue that the incorporation of already defective tissue into restoration of the abdominal wall, especially under tension, is a violation of the basic principles of hernia surgery. This argument has deterred surgeons from closing the hernia aperture ever since.

The laparoscopic method for ventral hernia repair was introduced in 1993 by LeBlanc and Booth, who first described the approach with the insertion of an intraperitoneal mesh without closure of the hernia aperture. Historically, the technique of overlapping the hernia aperture with a mesh without closing the aperture as a bridging repair has been standard practice when performing laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR). The quality of life of patients with a large hernia repaired using this laparoscopic method has not been shown to be improved significantly. Furthermore, over time the mesh may migrate and bulge out through the hernia aperture leading to recurrence. With this in mind, it has become more common to close the hernia aperture in order to improve abdominal wall functionby restoring the anatomy, and thereby decreasing the risk of hernia-site complications such as recurrence, mesh migration, pseudohernia, and seroma. Mesh migration and pseudohernia are seemingly synonymous in the literature, representing eventration of abdominal content through the abdominal wall.

### Outcomes following repair of incarcerated and strangulated ventral hernias with or without synthetic mesh [^89d90257]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design and setting

Prospectively collected data of consecutive patients with incarcerated or strangulated ventral hernia who were treated with or without synthetic mesh were reviewed. The study took place at the general surgery departments of Mansoura University principal hospital and Emergency hospital. Data collection involved patients treated between January 2014 and June 2016.

Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the institutional review board of Mansoura Faculty of medicine. The study was registered onunder the unique identifying number (UIN): researchregistry1891.

Eligibility criteria

Adult patients of both genders who presented with incarcerated or strangulated ventral hernia were included. Ventral hernias comprised all hernias arising from a defect in the anterior abdominal wall including umbilical, epigastric, incisional, and Spigelian hernias. Patients who underwent resection of gangrenous bowel and anastomosis were also included.

We excluded patients with other types of hernia other than ventral hernias, patients who underwent elective hernia repair after manual reduction of irreducible hernia, patients who underwent bowel resection with stoma formation, patients with incarcerated or strangulated omentum only without bowel involvement, and patients with associated necrotizing fasciitis of the anterior abdominal wall. Patients with incomplete records were also excluded.

Definition of procedures and outcomes

Incarcerated ventral hernia was defined as irreducible hernia associated with symptoms of bowel obstruction, yet with no compromise of the blood supply of the bowel. Strangulated hernia presented with partial or complete interruption of the blood supply of the intestine. After application of hot fomentation to the doubtful bowel loop, it was considered either viable and returned to the peritoneal cavity or non-viable and resection with anastomosis of the bowel ends was conducted.

Incisional hernias were defined as hernias occurring at the site of abdominal incision performed for procedures other than hernia repair. Recurrent hernias are the hernias occurring at the site of incision made for previous hernia repair. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surgical wound classification, incarcerated hernias were considered as class I (clean), strangulated hernias without bowel resection as class II (clean contaminated), and strangulated hernias with simultaneous bowel resection as class III (contaminated).

### Ileal atresia secondary to antenatal strangulation of littre's hernia in an exomphalos minor [^9f6a834b]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

We describe an unusual case of ileal atresia, resulting from antenatal strangulation of a Meckel's diverticulum in an exomphalos minor. This is a rare antenatal complication of Littre's hernia, which has not been previously described. A small exomphalos minor at the base of umbilical cord and late onset vascular accident at the narrow defect leading to ileal atresia may be missed in the prenatal diagnosis. The triad of exomphalos minor, Meckel's diverticulum and terminal ileal atresia secondary to antenatal strangulation of Littre's hernia is very rare to find in the same patient. A small exomphalos minor at the base of the umbilical cord can be missed even in the postnatal period. Our case lends direct evidence of vascular accident as a cause of ileal atresia and supports vascular theory. Whenever possible umbilicus should be preserved naturally and exomphalos sac should be opened higher up for excellent cosmetic results.

### An unusual case of umbilical hernia rupture with evisceration [^03e5f1f0]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Umbilical hernia is a common pediatric diagnosis for which the initial management is usually nonoperative. The high incidence of spontaneous closure and the infrequency of complications in the first few years of life justify this conservative management strategy. The authors present a case of a 5-month-old girl with a history of prematurity and prolonged ventilatory support, who subsequently experienced bowel evisceration via a previously uncomplicated umbilical hernia.

### Hernia-to-neck ratio is associated with emergent ventral hernia repair [^d9d5b8db]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The ratio of hernia size to fascial defect size, termed the hernia-to-neck ratio (HNR), has been proposed as a novel predictive factor for umbilical hernia complications. HNR ≥ 2.5 has been suggested to warrant surgery due to association with bowel strangulation, incarceration, and necrosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between HNR and emergent ventral hernia repair at our institution.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was performed of consecutive patients with ventral hernias evaluated at a large safety-net hospital from 2017 to 2019. Patients who required emergent ventral hernia repair were compared to patients who did not require repair at latest follow-up. HNR was calculated using a previously described method: maximal hernia sac size and maximal fascial defect size (termed "hernia neck size") were measured in the sagittal plane on CT scan. Data are described as mean ± standard deviation and median (interquartile range).

Results

A total of 166 patients were included: 84 (51%) required emergent hernia repair and 82 (49%) did not undergo repair. Median follow-up was 19 (8–27) months. Patient groups were similar except the emergent repair group had more males (50% vs. 34%, p = 0.03), umbilical hernias (93% vs. 56%, p < 0.01), recurrent hernias (31% vs. 15%, p < 0.01), and lower mean BMI (34.3 ± 9.9 vs. 39.1 ± 6.5, p < 0.01). Hernia sac size did not differ between groups (5.8 [3.8–8.4] cm vs. 6.1 [3.5–11.8] cm, p = 0.45). Hernia neck size was significantly smaller in the emergent repair group (1.5 [2.3–3.5] cm vs. 3.4 [1.8–6.2] cm, p < 0.01). Hernia-to-neck ratio was significantly higher in the emergent repair group (2.4 [1.8–3.1] vs. 1.7 [1.1–2.9], p < 0.01).

Conclusion

This study demonstrated an association between higher HNR and increased risk of emergent ventral hernia repair. Future studies will evaluate the use of HNR to risk-stratify patients with ventral hernias in a safety-net hospital.

### Closing the gap between the laparoscopic and open approaches to abdominal wall hernia repair: a trend and outcomes analysis of the ACS-NSQIP database [^c6dbf2f8]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess trends in utilization and perioperative outcomes of laparoscopic and open abdominal wall hernia repair.

Methods

Using the ACS-NSQIP database between 2009 and 2012, patients were identified as having an ICD-9 diagnosis of an umbilical, ventral, or incisional hernia as well as a CPT code for a laparoscopic or open abdominal wall hernia repair. A coarsened exact matching procedure was utilized to create a matched cohort to mitigate selection bias. Thirty-day outcomes analysis was done for the aggregate and matched cohorts. Subcategory analysis was performed for inpatient/outpatient status, strangulated/incarcerated hernias, initial/recurrent repairs, and hernia type (umbilical, ventral, incisional). Chi-square analysis was performed to determine the statistical significance of each comparison.

Results

In total, 112,074 qualifying patients were identified, 86,566 (77.24%) open and 25,508 (22.76%) laparoscopic. Patients undergoing laparoscopic repair were more likely to have preexisting comorbidities, but less likely to experience any postoperative morbidity (11.74 vs. 7.25%, P < 0.0001), serious morbidity (4.55 vs. 3.02%, P < 0.0001), or mortality (0.36 vs. 0.24%, P = 0.0030). Creation of the matched cohort produced 17,394 patients in both the laparoscopic and open groups and resulted in a loss of advantage for the laparoscopic approach in terms of morbidity associated with umbilical hernia repairs (P = 0.0082 vs. P = 0.3172). Patients undergoing laparoscopic repair were still less likely to experience any postoperative (9.57 vs. 4.92%, P < 0.0001) or serious morbidity (3.37 vs. 1.70%, P < 0.0001). Hospital length of stay in the matched cohort supported initial primary repairs done by an open approach.

Conclusion

The laparoscopic approach is used in a minority of abdominal wall hernia repairs, though utilization increased by 40% from 2009 to 2012. The laparoscopic approach continues to be safer on many fronts, but not all, and is arguably not better for umbilical or primary hernia repairs on the basis of overall morbidity and length of stay.

### Uncommon complication of pediatric umbilical hernia-spontaneous evisceration: case report and literature review [^7229f6e8]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The umbilical hernia is common in children. Most of the cases have a spontaneous regression around the age of 3 years. Complications are very rare, and thus surgery is not routinely indicated before the age of 3 years. We report an exceptional case of spontaneous rupture of an umbilical hernia with emphasis on the management of this rare complication and a literature review of similar cases.

### Strangulated bowel as an unusual complication of neonatal congenital diaphragmatic hernia: a case report and literature review [^f76f27a6]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Strangulation of bowel in utero causing infarction has been rarely reported in neonates. We report a case of congenital diaphragmatic hernia with bowel incarceration, requiring substantial resection of necrotic bowel. Despite a prolonged hospitalization, the patient had a good outcome and was discharged home nippling full enteral feeds. Three previous cases with a similar diagnosis were identified through a literature review and suggest a similar pattern of initial patient presentation.

### Guidelines for treatment of umbilical and epigastric hernias from the European hernia society and americas hernia society [^34e73480]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Umbilical and epigastric hernia repairs are frequently performed surgical procedures with an expected low complication rate. Nevertheless, the optimal method of repair with best short- and long-term outcomes remains debatable. The aim was to develop guidelines for the treatment of umbilical and epigastric hernias.

Methods

The guideline group consisted of surgeons from Europe and North America including members from the European Hernia Society and the Americas Hernia Society. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) critical appraisal checklists, and the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument were used. A systematic literature search was done on 1 May 2018, and updated on 1 February 2019.

Results

Literature reporting specifically on umbilical and epigastric hernias was limited in quantity and quality, resulting in a majority of the recommendations being graded as weak, based on low-quality evidence. The main recommendation was to use mesh for repair of umbilical and epigastric hernias to reduce the recurrence rate. Most umbilical and epigastric hernias may be repaired by an open approach with a preperitoneal flat mesh. A laparoscopic approach may be considered if the hernia defect is large, or if the patient has an increased risk of wound morbidity.

Conclusion

This is the first European and American guideline on the treatment of umbilical and epigastric hernias. It is recommended that symptomatic umbilical and epigastric hernias are repaired by an open approach with a preperitoneal flat mesh.

### Laparoscopic versus open anterior abdominal wall hernia repair: 30-day morbidity and mortality using the ACS-NSQIP database [^0a1bdcbe]. Annals of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare short-term outcomes after laparoscopic and open abdominal wall hernia repair.

Methods

Using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database (2005–2009), 71,054 patients who underwent an abdominal wall hernia repair were identified (17% laparoscopic, 83% open). Laparoscopic and open techniques were compared. Regression models and nonparametric 1:1 matching algorithms were used to minimize the influence of treatment selection bias. The association between surgical approach and risk-adjusted adverse event rates after abdominal wall hernia repair was determined. Subgroup analysis was performed between inpatient/outpatient surgery, strangulated/reducible, and initial/recurrent hernias as well as between umbilical, incisional and other ventral hernias.

Results

Patients undergoing laparoscopic repair were less likely to experience an overall morbidity (6.0% vs. 3.8%; odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56–0.68) or a serious morbidity (2.5% vs. 1.6%; OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.52–0.71) compared to open repair. Analysis using multivariate adjustment and patient matching showed similar findings. Mortality rates were the same. Laparoscopically repaired strangulated and recurrent hernias, had a significantly lower overall morbidity (4.7% vs. 8.1%, P < 0.0001 and 4.1% vs. 12.2%, P < 0.0001, respectively). Significantly lower overall morbidity was also noted for the laparoscopic approach when the hernias were categorized into umbilical (1.9% vs. 3.0%, P = 0.009), ventral (3.9% vs. 6.3%, P < 0.0001), and incisional (4.3% vs. 9.1%, P < 0.0001). No differences were noted between laparoscopic and open repairs in patients undergoing outpatient surgery, when the hernias were reducible.

Conclusion

Laparoscopic hernia repair is infrequently used and associated with lower 30-day morbidity, particularly when hernias are complicated.

### Update of guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS))-part a… [^75e655d8]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Emergency hernia

A prospective nationwide study reported that the emergency rate accounted to 8.5% [6]. There were significantly more patients with concomitant bowel resection after emergency repairs than after elective repairs (p < 0.001). Furthermore, emergency umbilical/epigastric or incisional hernia repair was associated with up to 15-fold higher mortality, reoperation, and readmission rates than elective repair. Patients who underwent repair for incarceration were more likely to have strangulation, pain, and bowel obstruction than patients who had repair without incarceration or patients treated non-operatively (p < 0.02 each) [7]. Similarly, a prospective study also reported a complication rate of 21.3% in emergency repair [8].

Age

Old age was an important risk factor for emergency repair in both ventral/incisional hernias and umbilical hernias. One study demonstrates that older patients are more likely not aware that they have an incisional hernia [3]. Furthermore, advanced age was also a significant independent risk factor for poor early outcomes (readmission, reoperation, or death within 30 days) (p < 0.05) [3, 7].

### Efficacy of adhesive strapping on umbilical hernia in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies [^968824ab]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The proportion of large hernias in each arm should also be considered when interpreting the results. Some studies indicated that the size of the UH did not influence its closure. For instance, Heifetz et al reported that 72 out of 78 patients (92%) with UH > 0.5 cm were cured spontaneously within 4 years. Meier et al revealed that spontaneous closure of UHs > 10 mm in diameter with at least 5 mm protrusion seemed to occur by the age of 14. However, Walkerindicated that the diameter of the internal fascial ring was the most relevant parameter to determine whether spontaneous UH closure would be accomplished and that the healing rate differed according to the UH size. In our study, the proportion of large hernias in the AS group was higher in four studiesand was not mentioned in five studies. One study reported that the average size of UH in the AS group was smaller than that in the observation group. Although we did not show an advantage of AS for large hernias, there would be several variabilities in this subgroup analysis, such as insufficient patient numbers, differences in the proportion between the two groups, and the definition of "large hernias". From these points of view, randomized controlled trials with strict definitions of large hernias measured by ultrasound are warranted to reach a conclusion.

### Rare complications after esophagectomy: incidence, clinical features, risk factors, management, and prevention [^95b2b9dc]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Other hernias

Every area involved in esophagectomy is a potential site of herniation. In addition to hiatal hernias, retrocardiac lung hernias, intercostal lung hernias, trocar-site hernias, internal hernias to the retrosternal spaceand pericardiumand mesenteric defectsmay also occur after esophagectomy. Each of these hernias is associated with unique risk factors related to the surgical procedure; however, most patients present with clinical symptoms and need surgery.

Dissection of the pleura is necessary for retrocardiac lung hernias that develop after esophagectomy; several factors may contribute to this complication, such as partial contralateral lung resection, aspiration via a drainage tube, or reconstruction via the nonretromediastinal route. The herniated lung should be reintegrated into the thoracic cavity, and the hernial orifice should be closed properly by suturing the mediastinal pleura. An intercostal lung hernia is caused by defects or weakness of the chest wall and has been reported in two-stage minimally invasive esophagectomy. Intercostal lung hernias may cause coughs, chest pain, or dyspnea; however, most hernias are asymptomatic and differ from retrocardiac lung hernias. Asymptomatic cases may be managed conservatively with observation, and symptomatic cases can be managed via surgical closure of the intercostal and thoracic wall muscles.

Although trocar-site hernias have not been reported as a postesophagectomy complication, some cases have been reported after laparoscopic surgery. Usually, suturing abdominal fascia defects at trocar sites measuring ≤ 8 mm is unnecessary, whereas fascial defects at trocar sites measuring ⩾10 mm require surgical closure. Moreover, the incidence of complications is greater for defects located at the umbilical trocar than for defects located at the lateral trocar. Trocar-site hernias can lead to small bowel obstruction or even life-threatening strangulation if not recognized in a timely manner. We observed a left lower abdominal wall hernia at the site of a 5-mm trocar 2 days after esophagectomy, which led to small bowel obstruction. This hernia was treated with emergency surgery (Figure 8).

Case presentation

A 35-year-old G 2 P 0010 Cameroonian student at 39-weeks pregnancy was referred to the surgical unit of the Yaounde Gynaeco-Obstetrics and Paediatric Hospital for the management of a strangulated umbilical hernia. She had a sudden onset of localized umbilical pain three hours prior to consultation. The pain was of moderate intensity, crampy in character, aggravated by walking, without any change in bowel movement and no vomiting. An abdominal ultrasound scan revealed a parietal defect of the umbilicus measuring 55 mm in diameter with a poorly vascularised hypoechoic mass (doppler scan) measuring 50 × 30 × 37 mm, 29.6 mL in volume. In addition, the foetus was viable with a normal biophysical score and a good concordance between clinical and sonographic dating of gestational age. Hence, she was referred for surgical management of a strangulated umbilical hernia in a term pregnancy.

### Congenital hernia of cord: an often misdiagnosed entity [^e2a3e548]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Congenital hernia of the cord, also known as umbilical cord hernia, is an often misdiagnosed and under-reported entity, easily confused with a small omphalocele. It is different from postnatally diagnosed umbilical hernias and is believed to arise from persistent physiological mid-gut herniation. Its incidence is estimated to be 1 in 5000. Unlike an omphalocele, it is considered benign and is not linked with chromosomal anomalies. It has been loosely associated with intestinal anomalies, suggesting the need for a complete fetal anatomical ultrasound evaluation. We present a case of a fetal umbilical cord hernia diagnosed in a 28-year-old woman at 21 weeks gestation. The antenatal and intrapartum courses were uncomplicated. It was misdiagnosed postnatally as a small omphalocele, causing unwarranted anxiety in the parents. Increased awareness and knowledge of such an entity among health professionals is important to prevent unwarranted anxiety from misdiagnosis, and inadvertent bowel injury during cord clamping at delivery.

### Efficacy of adhesive strapping on umbilical hernia in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies [^bbc2e176]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

UH closure rate at 6 months of age

Five studies compared the UH closure rate at the age of 6 months (table 3). The closure rates of UH were consistently higher in the AS group in four studies, and the meta-analysis showed a significant difference between the AS group and the observation group, as presented in the forest plot (p < 0.01, RR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.75; moderate heterogeneity was found: p = 0.03, I² = 63%) (figure 3A).

Figure 3
Forest plots of secondary endpoints comparing the AS group and the observation-only group: (A) unsuccessful UH closure at the age of 6 months old, (B) among large UH, (C) event of umbilical protrusion with redundant skin, and (D) among only recent studies. Events: unsuccessful UH closure. AS, adhesive strapping; RR, risk ratio; UH, umbilical hernia.

Efficacy of AS on UH closure among large hernias

Four studies evaluated the efficacy of AS on large hernias (table 3). The definitions of large hernia varied; the defect diameter was > 5 mm in two studiesand > 10 mm in another study. The other study defined a large hernia as an hernia with an orifice that permits passage of a fingertip. Therefore, this analysis was performed with four studies that had different definitions. Three studiesrevealed a higher cure rate in the AS group than in the observation group, except one. According to the forest plot, however, there was no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.33, RR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.44; moderate heterogeneity was found: p = 0.08, I² = 55%) (figure 3B). When analyzing two studiesthat defined hernias > 5 mm in diameter as large hernias, there was also no significant difference (p = 0.15, RR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.31; moderate heterogeneity was found: p = 0.21, I² = 35%).

Efficacy of AS among mature and premature infants

Only one study reported the efficacy of AS based on maturity. Among premature infants, the UH closure rate after AS was 80%. In the study, there were no premature infants who underwent observation. Among mature infants, the closure rates with and without AS were reported as 85.7% and 90.0%, respectively.

### Flood syndrome [^082ab60b]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Flood syndrome, named for the rush of fluid or flood that accompanies spontaneous rupture of an umbilical hernia, is a rare complication of long-standing ascites and end-stage liver disease. Patients with cirrhosis complicated by ascites have a 20% risk of umbilical hernia development during the course of their disease. The umbilicus represents a weak portion of the abdominal wall as it interrupts the linea alba. The peritoneum and overlying skin at the site of an umbilical hernia can break down completely, leading to expulsion of intra-abdominal contents. Rupture of an umbilical hernia usually occurs with drainage of ascitic fluid, which is given the term spontaneous paracentesis. Rupture may follow a sudden increase in intra-abdominal pressure with coughing, vomiting, straining, or rising from a seated position. Rarely, evisceration of the small intestine can occur. In most cases (80%), development of cutaneous ulcerations precedes umbilical hernia rupture. Complications of umbilical hernia rupture include incarceration of bowel, hypotension secondary to large-volume spontaneous paracentesis, and the development of cellulitis, peritonitis, and sepsis. Ulceration or necrosis over an umbilical hernia should be considered a dangerous sign, signaling impending rupture, and should prompt urgent surgical referral.

### Incarcerated umbilical hernia in a super-super-obese patient [^d1f82f3a]. Obesity Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Abdominal wall hernias are more prevalent in the morbidly obese. Incarceration of external hernias is a relatively common process in adults and is associated to a high rate of complications and mortality. We present the case of a morbidly super-super-obese patient (body mass index, 80 kg/m(2)) who underwent emergency surgery for an incarcerated umbilical hernia; the patient died despite segmental intestinal resection, hernia repair using mesh, and intensive care.

### Risk and outcome of bowel resection in patients with incarcerated groin hernias: retrospective study [^9caa5f09]. World Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

The goal of this retrospective study was to evaluate factors that increase the risk of bowel necrosis and document the outcome of bowel resection in patients with strangulated hernias. We identified 102 patients (60 men, 42 women) who underwent surgical treatment for an incarcerated hernia at the Kartal Education and Research Hospital Emergency Unit between April 1997 and April 2001. Patients in group 1 required intestinal resection (n = 16), and patients in group 2 did not (n = 86). The median age of the patients was 53 years (range 3–96). Demographic and surgical data were obtained from the patients' charts and compared between the two groups. Women required bowel resections more often than men (p < 0.05). Patients older than 65 years and those with femoral or epigastric hernias required resection more often than patients younger than 65 years and those with inguinal, umbilical, or incisional hernias (p < 0.05 for all). Group 1 patients had a longer hospitalization and experienced more overall complications and wound infections than group 2 (p < 0.05 for all). In conclusion, incarcerated hernias are more common in men, but intestinal resection is required more often in women. The risk of intestinal resection is higher for patients with femoral hernias and those older than 65 years. Patients who undergo intestinal resection have a higher overall complication rate related to wound infections but not an increased risk of other complications or mortality.

### Update of guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)): part B [^23f9200f]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with symptomatic umbilical, ventral, and incisional hernias and concomitant rectus abdominis diastasis represent a growing clinical problem and, as with isolated hernias, the ideal operative management of this complex hernia situation has not been defined. With regards to isolated rectus diastasis, defined as a thinning and widening of the linea alba, combined with laxity of the ventral abdominal wall musculature, controversy remains as to whether this pathology is cosmetic or functional due to the variation in severity, symptomatology, and the absence of strangulation risk found with hernias [9]. While physiotherapy can achieve a limited benefit with regards to size and symptoms with isolated mild rectus diastasis, surgery significantly improves abdominal wall function and pain regardless of operative technique employed and should be considered with diastasis wider than 3 cm [10]. Currently, both plication and hernia repair methods are used to repair isolated rectus abdominis diastasis with no clear distinction in recurrence rate, postoperative complications, or patient reported outcomes found in the literature [9, 10].

The presence of rectus abdominis diastasis and coexisting hernia presents a greater challenge as the weakened linea alba and ventral abdominal musculature increase the risk of hernia formation, compromise the integrity of the midline, and complicate the repair of ventral hernias. Köhler et al. demonstrated that a coexisting rectus diastasis significantly increases hernia recurrence rate with primary sutured closure (31 vs. 8%) [11]. As such, well established principles from ventral hernia repair including primary closure with non-absorbable sutures and mesh repair should be utilized to decrease hernia and diastasis recurrence [11]. Mesh repair of ventral hernias is well established as safe reducing the recurrence rate significantly compared to suture repair. Based on the volume of Level 1 studies studying ventral hernia, mesh reinforcement of ventral hernia repairs with a concomitant rectus diastasis is recommended while studies specifically evaluating ventral hernia and rectus diastasis corroborate these findings [12].

### Efficacy of adhesive strapping on umbilical hernia in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies [^3e0dfa93]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Although our study did not show the significance of the efficacy of AS on the closure rate, it indicated some possible advantages through secondary outcomes. One of them was the efficacy of earlier UH closure.

As Cresson and Pillingdescribed, there was already some agreement in the 1950s that AS has no advantage after the age of 6 months. While Cresson and Pilling also noted from their experience that AS rarely hastened UH healing, our result corresponded to a previous study that revealed that the treatment duration was shorter in the AS group than in the observation group. Once AS is applied at an earlier age, it accelerates the healing of UH and the duration of UH existence is expected to be shortened. Consequently, it reduces the burden and anxiety of parents. Therefore, it is rational that AS was mostly applied within 6 months in recent studies to close UH earlier. The earliest time of application was less than 1 month of age, 18 days old. However, no study has revealed how early AS could be safely applied and how effective AS would be when applied earlier. Regarding premature infants, it was also uncertain whether the corrected age should be adopted rather than the real age. Factors such as umbilical condition, gestational age, and body weight should likely be considered for AS application.

Another possible benefit of AS to babies with UH is that AS prevents umbilical protrusion with redundant skin. In most studies, UH closure was defined as the closure of the orifice regardless of the umbilical figure. Therefore, if an umbilical defect is closed spontaneously, patients with protruding umbilicus will undergo umbilicoplasty for cosmetic reasons. According to the included studies, the prevalence of the protruding umbilicus at the end of the study was 0%–9.4% and 10%–18.8% in the AS and observation groups, respectively. This result corresponded to a study that gathered data from multiple institutions through questionnaires; it reported that the prevalence rates of redundant skin among patients who were regarded as cured from UH were 107 of 908 (11.8%) in the AS group and 33 of 146 (22.8%) in the observation-only group. Regarding umbilicoplasty, Hayashida et al reported that the operation time of patients who tried AS was shorter than that of patients without AS. The authors also mentioned that the difficulty of umbilicoplasty depended on the existence of redundant skin. Therefore, if AS prevents redundant skin and disfigurement of the umbilicus, it may be beneficial to patients.

### Cholecystocutaneous fistula: an unusual complication of a para-umbilical hernia repair [^128256c8]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

This case describes a 94-year-old woman who presented 2years postsutured para-umbilical hernia repair with a painful black lump protruding through her scar with blood stained discharge. This was initially thought to be either ischaemic bowel secondary to strangulated incisional hernia or a large organised haematoma. An urgent CT scan was performed following which the patient passed two large calculi and bile-stained fluid spontaneously through the wound, making the diagnosis somewhat clearer. The scan revealed an incisional hernia containing the gallbladder and two large calculi at the skin surface and an incidental large caecal cancer with surrounding lymphadenopathy. Frail health and the incidental finding of a colon cancer rendered invasive surgical management inappropriate. Therefore, she was managed conservatively with antibiotics. A catheter was inserted into the fistula tract to allow free drainage and alleviate pressure-related symptoms. The patient was discharged following a multidisciplinary team discussion.

### Efficacy of adhesive strapping on umbilical hernia in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies [^9f48ade7]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

AS procedure

Regarding the initiation age, eight studies mostly applied AS within the first 6 months. One study did not mention it clearly, but the author probably applied it to patients of less than 6 months. Infants less than 1 year old were included in a study. There were several differences in the procedures of the included studies (table 2). First, in the studies before 2000, an elastic plaster or tape was directly applied after the hernia was reduced. However, in the latest studies after 2000, a cotton ball or a plug was inserted on the umbilicus, and subsequently plaster was placed in all studies except one. Second, the frequency of changing AS varied in studies. In four studies, AS was changed weekly, in two studies every 2–3 weeks, in one study every 4 weeks, and two studies did not determine the specific period except when a plaster became dirty or peeled off and the frequency was not mentioned. Third, AS was changed by doctors or nurses in two studies and was changed by guardians at home in three studies. The other five studies did not mention who changed AS. Two studies reported that 7.8% and 12.6% of patients discontinued AS due to skin trouble. One study excluded two patients who could not continue AS. The overall duration of AS was reported in four studies. The shortest duration was reported to be 11 daysand the longest was 10 months. The average duration was mentioned in three studies: 2 months in two studiesand 49 days in the other.

Efficacy of the intervention

Overall UH closure in the AS group and observation group

The meta-analysis comparing AS and observation-only management was conducted on 10 cohort studies (table 3). We compared unsuccessful UH closure rates of each group to calculate the RR, and there was no statistical significance between the two groups as per the forest plot shown in figure 2 (p = 0.31, RR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.28; heterogeneity was found: p < 0.01, I² = 71%).

### British society of gastroenterology best practice guidance: outpatient management of cirrhosis-part 3: special circumstances [^de580b5b]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Predictive models used in patients with cirrhosis undergoing surgery

In patients with cirrhosis, non-urgent surgery should be deferred until an adequate assessment has been undertaken and their liver disease optimised. The clinical team should consider referral to a unit with experience in managing patients with cirrhosis, where appropriate. Consideration should also be given to non-surgical options if available/appropriate. Care should be taken to optimise nutrition. For patients with compensated cirrhosis, after appropriate perioperative risk stratification and counselling, surgery may then be indicated.

Emergency surgery in patients with cirrhosis carries an increased mortality risk, and cirrhosis is an independent predictor of death. In the emergency setting, where deferring surgery may not be feasible, the patient and surgical, anaesthetic and medical teams must weigh the potential benefits and risks collaboratively. Table 2 summarises the anaesthetic considerations when planning surgery in patients with cirrhosis.

Table 2
Anaesthetic considerations in the cirrhotic patient

Surgery in decompensated cirrhosis

Surgery in patients with decompensated cirrhosis carries a significantly higher mortality risk than compensated cirrhosis. Eligibility for liver transplantation, if the patient was to decompensate following surgery, should be determined prior to surgery. In patients with Child-Pugh C or MELD > 20, surgery should be avoided or delayed until after liver transplantation, if possible, for all but the most urgent and lifesaving procedures. Good palliation of symptoms is crucial in patients unsuitable for transplant where surgery is considered too high risk, as well as in all patients waiting for surgery post-transplant.

Abdominal wall hernias are common in patients with cirrhosis and ascites, and mortality is high in those undergoing surgery. The clinical team should consider discussion with an experienced centre to guide management of recurrent ascites with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) and other sequelae of decompensation in the perioperative/postoperative period. The decision to offer hernia repair and its timing will be influenced by the patient's eligibility for liver transplantation and the nature of their presentation. Where patients have undergone assessment and are awaiting liver transplantation, hernia repair may be deferred until the time of transplantation (when it can be undertaken during or following liver transplantation). In patients who are not candidates for liver transplantation elective repair of symptomatic umbilical hernia (if feasible) can be undertaken and may avoid the added risk of emergency surgery. In patients who develop life-threatening complications of an abdominal wall hernia (skin breakdown with leaking ascites, incarceration, obstruction or strangulation) emergency repair may still be undertaken but the morbidity and mortality increases significantly.

### Effectiveness and safety of mesh repair for incarcerated or strangulated hernias: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6032d79e]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hernia repair with mesh in patients with incarcerated or strangulated hernias is controversial. Moreover, the use of mesh for hernia repair with concomitant bowel resection poses a great dilemma. This study compared the outcomes of mesh and anatomic repairs in patients with acutely incarcerated or strangulated hernias.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for studies published before November 2019. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective studies were included. We conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model. The treatment outcome was measured by the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI), seroma formation, and hernia recurrence postoperatively.

Results

Two RCTs and six prospective studies with 978 patients were included. No significant difference in SSI incidence was observed between patients with incarcerated hernia from the mesh and anatomic repair groups. Recurrence was significantly lower in mesh repair group than in anatomic repair group (odds ratio, 0.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.01–0.45). Only two patients needed to have mesh explantation due to mesh infection. In the setting of hernia repair with concomitant bowel resection, the SSI rate with mesh repair was slightly higher, but most cases of infections were well controlled with conservative antibiotic therapy.

Conclusions

Mesh repair for incarcerated or strangulated hernias was feasible with a great benefit of lower recurrence rates. However, due to limited data, drawing conclusions regarding the use of mesh for hernia repair with concomitant bowel resection was difficult. Further studies with preset criteria for evaluating patients undergoing concomitant bowel resection may help elucidate this issue.

### Primary umbilical hernia repair: does suture type matter? [^2ac9c67d]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Umbilical hernias are extremely common, estimated to be prevalent in 23–50 percent of people. They account for approximately 6% to 14% of all abdominal wall hernias in adults. 90% of adult umbilical hernias are acquired due to increased intra-abdominal pressure from obesity, ascites, pregnancy, or chronic cough. Surgical repair of umbilical hernias is recommended for worsening pain, increase in size, and/or bowel obstructive symptoms. Primary suture repair is the general recommendation for small umbilical hernias, specifically those two centimeters or less in size. However, the risk of hernia recurrence with primary umbilical repair is not insignificant, estimated to be anywhere from 4.9 to 27 percent. The rate of recurrence appears to be related to the dimensions of the hernia, with smaller defects tending to have lower recurrence rate following repair.

Currently, there is little literature to support what suture type will provide the best repair with lowest recurrence risk for primary umbilical hernias. There are a myriad of suture types used for repair. Most commonly used sutures include monofilament absorbable (polydioxanone suture (PDS)), monofilament permanent (Prolene), and braided (Ethibond) suture. Several studies have been conducted to determine which suture is best to use when closing the abdominal cavity with surgeries such as laparotomies. However, in the setting of small primary umbilical hernias little is known about optimal suture choice for repair. While many surgeons use non-absorbable suture, there are also those who use absorbable suture in these cases with reportedly good outcomes.

Our study's primary outcome aims to identify if there is less recurrence based on suture type. Secondary outcomes were evaluated looking for recurrence rates between repair techniques as well as comparisons between permanent and absorbable monofilament suture. In addition, we evaluated the rate of suture granulomas and wound infections.

### The combined laparoscopic approach for the treatment of incarcerated inguinal hernia [^8020ce95]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The traditional open approach to incarcerated inguinal hernia has several drawbacks including difficulty avoiding tension in the swollen and edematous tissues leading to a higher recurrence rate, possible contamination of the mesh if it is implanted in an area of bowel strangulation, and proper evaluation of whether ischemic bowel requires resection or not, which may mandate laparotomy. This study aimed to evaluate an approach that combines intraperitoneal laparoscopic exploration with hernia reduction and total extraperitoneal (TEP) repair of the hernia.

Methods

An exploratory laparoscopy is performed. The incarcerated content is gently retracted into the abdominal cavity and inspected. If no resection is needed, the gas is deflated, the umbilical trocar is removed, and the preperitoneal space is accessed with a Hasson trocar inserted behind the rectus muscle toward the pelvis. Two additional 5-mm trocars are inserted into the preperitoneal space in the lower midline. A standard TEP repair with mesh is performed.

Results

Between 2005 and 2008, 15 patients underwent laparoscopic exploration for incarcerated inguinal hernia followed by TEP repair. Of the 15 patients, 8 had acute incarceration and 7 had chronic irreducible hernia. Reduction of the incarcerated content was straightforward, and no bowel resection was needed. No major complications or wound or mesh infections occurred.

Conclusion

The combined laparoscopic approach offers a solution to incarceration of inguinal hernias while taking advantage of each separate approach. The first part of the procedure enables easy reduction of the incarcerated content and assessment of its viability. The second part enables a simple and standard repair, similar to that for an elective case. If bowel necrosis is suspected preoperatively, an open anterior approach should be taken to avoid possible intraabdominal contamination.

TEP for incarcerated and strangulated inguinal hernia

Statements

Recommendations

In 2004, Ferzli et al. described their experience with TEP to repair 11 acutely incarcerated inguinal hernias. Eight repairs were completed via TEP and three converted to open repairs. They describe the use of various releasing incisions to free the incarcerated sac depending on the nature of the hernia (direct, indirect, or femoral). Ferzli et al. [12] reported no recurrences, a single mesh infection that resolved with continuous irrigation, and a midline wound infection after bowel resection. In 2003, Tamme et al. [13] showed the results of a large series of TEP repairs of inguinal hernias. In this group, he includes, but does not detail, repairs performed on strangulated hernias. His overall results demonstrated low rates of recurrence and complications. Among his conclusions is that TEP is particularly advantageous for the treatment of bilateral, recurrent, and strangulated hernias versus open and TAPP repairs. He cites a reduction in postoperative neuralgia versus open repair and a reduction in bowel injury and port site hernia versus TAPP. Saggar and Sarang [14] retrospectively looked at 34 patients (of 286 elective TEP hernia repairs) who underwent repair of chronically incarcerated inguinal hernia using TEP. Recurrence rate was higher for incarcerated versus nonincarcerated hernias (5.8 vs. 0.35%). The recurrences in the incarcerated group (n = 2) occurred during the immediate postoperative period and 2 months postoperatively. Scrotal hematoma and cord induration also were significantly higher in the incarcerated group. He converted the umbilical port to an intraperitoneal port to inspect the bowel when its viability was in question.

### Trocar site hernia after gastric sleeve [^3e67d182]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Another limitation is the potential of bias in symptomatic patients, as all patients were aware of the purpose of the study when accepting inclusion, but this is in part contradicted by the fact that so few of them reported symptoms of TSH or own belief in that they had this condition. Perhaps the main limitation is the large number of our patients having been subjected to abdominal surgery prior to or after the bariatric procedure, thereby making our results not undeniably connected to the gastric sleeve. Of the 21 patients with previous abdominal surgery (Table 2), six had midline incisions and none of them had a hernia in our study, but two hernias (both at the umbilical trocar site) were found in patients with previous laparoscopy. Also, there may have been undetected preexisting umbilical hernias in previously non-operated patients. In three patients, an umbilical hernia was suspected at clinical examination documented in the patient journal at any time previous to the gastric sleeve, none of them had any mentioning of umbilical hernia in the surgeon's documentation from the gastric sleeve operation. The reason these patients were included was the large difficulty in obtaining enough patients willing to participate to maintain an adequate power. To partly account for these limitations, careful reviewing of relevant medical records, including the surgeon's documentations of procedures, descriptions of clinical examinations and imaging have been made, for as full disclosure as possible. Procedures not engaging the upper abdomen, umbilical region or midline are not reported in the study.

The clinical relevance of these hernias is due to the fact that they can lead to significant morbidity such as bowel obstruction and strangulation and require acute surgery. But the proportion of the symptomatic cases is poorly understood. None of the 79 patients in our study had up to follow-up been subjected to hernia repair. In the survey sent out to the patients asking them to answer questions regarding their experience of TSH related symptoms, only a few reported discomfort or pain from the trocar sites, and there was no significant correlation of those who did to those with TSH at CT. Nevertheless, our results of an alarming 21.5% incidence of TSH are in line with other recent data, and bearing in mind the high number of laparoscopic procedures performed, even a small proportion of symptomatic TSH can amount to a significant patient suffering and strain on the welfare systems. To further understand the relevance of symptomatic TSH and TSH repair, we are presently conducting a larger register study of more than forty thousand patients laparoscopically operated for obesity in Sweden.

### Diagnostic ambiguity of aseptic necrobiosis of a uterine fibroid in a term pregnancy: a case report [^f50a6125]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Uterine fibroids are the most common uterine tumours in females of reproductive age. During pregnancy, uterine fibroids may be complicated by aseptic necrobiosis. We herein report an ambiguous clinical presentation of uterine fibroids in pregnancy and discuss the diagnostic challenges encountered in our resource-constraint setting.

Case Presentation

A term pregnant Cameroonian woman was admitted to our maternity unit with clinical findings suggestive of a strangulated umbilical hernia. She underwent an emergency caesarean section which fortuitously revealed aseptic necrobiosis of a uterine fibroid, managed within the same surgical intervention by myomectomy. Her post-operative course was uneventful.

Conclusion

The authors highlight the need for a high index of suspicion by healthcare providers, as well as the need for a multidisciplinary approach for a favourable maternal and foetal outcome.

### If laparoscopic technique can be used for treatment of acutely incarcerated / strangulated inguinal hernia? [^e7d92498]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Laparoscopic treatment for acutely incarcerated/strangulated inguinal hernias is uncommon and controversial. In the present study, we assessed the safety and feasibility of transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair for the treatment of acutely incarcerated/strangulated inguinal hernias.

Methods

Patients with acutely incarcerated/strangulated inguinal hernias who underwent TAPP repair at the Department of Hernia and Abdominal Wall Surgery (Beijing Chaoyang Hospital) from January 2017 to December 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients' characteristics, operation details, and postoperative complications were retrospectively analyzed.

Results

In total, 94 patients with acutely incarcerated/strangulated inguinal hernias underwent TAPP repair. The patients comprised 85 men and 9 women (mean age, 54.3 ± 13.6 years; mean operating time, 61.6 ± 17.7 min; mean hospital stay, 3.9 ± 2.2 days). No patients were converted to open surgery. Hernia reduction was successfully performed in all patients. The morbidity of complications was 20.2% (19/94). Two bowel resections were performed endoscopically. Nine (9.6%) patients avoided unnecessary bowel resections during laparoscopic procedures. All patients recovered well without severe complications. No recurrence or infection was recorded during a mean follow-up period of 26.8 ± 9.8 months.

Conclusions

TAPP appears to be safe and feasible for treatment of patients with acutely incarcerated/strangulated inguinal hernias. However, it requires performed by experienced surgeons in laparoscopic techniques.

### Spontaneous bowel evisceration through umbilical hernia in an adult non-cirrhotic patient [^1452fa71]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Figure 3
Factors contributing to umbilical hernia, skin necrosis and rupture, and small bowel evisceration (Author: Dr Matteo Zanchetta).

Learning points

Spontaneous hernia sac rupture is a sporadic occurrence, and accompanying small bowel evisceration is even rarer, particularly in patients without cirrhosis.
Spontaneous bowel evisceration through umbilical hernia (UH) is commonly associated with chronic increase in intra-abdominal pressure, such as refractory ascites in cirrhotic patients, obesity and pregnancy.
Each UH patient necessitates tailored management, and apart from asymptomatic UHs with no aesthetic compromise, this abdominal wall defect should always be repaired surgically, possibly electively to decrease the risk of complications associated with emergency repair.
Surgery is always necessary for small bowel evisceration through UH; and in emergency settings, a direct repair of the defect is advocated.
Mesh placement should always be considered if comorbidities do not contraindicate it.

### Abdominal hernia… [^571a9bf1]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. A hernia develops when a weakness that forms in the abdominal wall enables part of the intestine or another organ to protrude through it. Among the most common are umbilical hernias that occur at the navel and inguinal hernias that are seen in the groin area. There are 2 types of inguinal hernia, indirect and direct, that may look similar but have different locations of the protruding intestine. Incisional hernias occur where an incision has been made in the abdominal wall for an operation. Symptoms The first symptom of a hernia is usually a small bulging under the skin that is generally painless but may produce discomfort and get larger during strenuous activities or coughing. At this stage, the hernia is reducible because its contents can be pushed back into the abdomen. However, if the hernia grows, it may become incarcerated.

If blood stops flowing through an incarcerated bowel, this results in strangulation, which is accompanied by pain, often with nausea, vomiting, or constipation. A hernia may result in entrapment of other organs or nerves, producing constipation or problems with urination or sexual function. A strangulated hernia is a surgical emergency because part of the bowel may become necrotic, resulting in life-threatening peritonitis needing surgical removal of part of the bowel. If you have a hernia and significant abdominal pain, pain over the hernia, or nausea or vomiting, you should seek medical care immediately. Treatment Initial treatment of a minor hernia includes avoiding heavy lifting and strenuous exercises and, sometimes, wearing a support. It used to be thought that all hernias should be repaired.

However, recent evidence suggests that repair should be performed only if significant discomfort or pain is associated with the hernia. TOPIC: SURGERY Pluta RM, Burke AE, Golub RM. Abdominal Hernia. JAMA. 2011; 305:

### Randomized clinical trial comparing suture and mesh repair of umbilical hernia in adults [^988159a9]. The British Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Prosthetic repair has become the standard method for inguinal hernia and has excellent results. The question remains of whether the mesh technique could also improve results for umbilical defects.

Methods

The study was a randomized clinical trial comparing herniorrhaphy (primary suture) with hernioplasty (polypropylene mesh or plug) in 200 adult patients with a primary umbilical hernia. Patients at high anaesthetic risk (American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade IV) or those who needed emergency surgery were excluded. The mean postoperative follow-up was 64 months. The population studied included 118 women and 82 men with a mean age at presentation of 57 years. Some 173 patients were ASA grade I-II and 27 were ASA III. The anaesthetic technique of choice was local anaesthetic infiltration plus sedation (98 per cent).

Results

There were no significant anaesthetic complications or surgical deaths. The mean duration of surgery was greater for mesh than for suture repair (45 versus 38 min). Rates of early complications such as seroma, haematoma or wound infection were similar in the two groups. The hernia recurrence rate was higher after suture repair (11 per cent) than after mesh repair (1 per cent) (P = 0.0015).

Conclusion

Prosthetic repair could become the standard treatment for primary umbilical hernia in adults.

### Umbilical hernia repair in conjunction with abdominoplasty: a surgical technique to maintain umbilical blood supply [^4d222d49]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Abdominal wall hernias are often diagnosed on clinical examination or encountered intraoperatively during an abdominoplasty. Traditional surgical techniques for abdominoplasty and umbilical hernia repair, when performed simultaneously, can potentially compromise the vascular supply to the umbilicus. The authors describe a simplified surgical technique for the correction of umbilical hernias in conjunction with abdominoplasty. This procedure avoids any fascial incisions immediately adjacent to the umbilicus, thereby maintaining a maximal blood supply to the umbilical stalk. Over a six-year period, 17 patients underwent the described procedure. None have had a recurrence of their hernia or umbilical necrosis, and the aesthetics of the umbilicus have been improved.

### Mesh versus suture repair of umbilical hernia in adults: a randomised, double-blind, controlled, multicentre trial [^a16da483]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Both mesh and suture repair are used for the treatment of umbilical hernias, but for smaller umbilical hernias (diameter 1–4 cm) there is little evidence whether mesh repair would be beneficial. In this study we aimed to investigate whether use of a mesh was better in reducing recurrence compared with suture repair for smaller umbilical hernias.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, controlled multicentre trial in 12 hospitals (nine in the Netherlands, two in Germany, and one in Italy). Eligible participants were adults aged at least 18 years with a primary umbilical hernia of diameter 1–4 cm, and were randomly assigned (1:1) intraoperatively to either suture repair or mesh repair. In the first 3 years of the inclusion period, blocked randomisation (of non-specified size) was achieved by an envelope randomisation system; after this time computer-generated randomisation was introduced. Patients, investigators, and analysts were masked to the allocated treatment, and participants were stratified by hernia size (1–2 cm and > 2–4 cm). At study initiation, all surgeons were invited to training sessions to ensure they used the same standardised techniques for suture repair or mesh repair. Patients underwent physical examinations at 2 weeks, and 3, 12, and 24–30 months after the operation. The primary outcome was the rate of recurrences of the umbilical hernia after 24 months assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population by physical examination and, in case of any doubt, abdominal ultrasound. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00789230.

Findings

Between June 21, 2006, and April 16, 2014, we randomly assigned 300 patients, 150 to mesh repair and 150 to suture repair. The median follow-up was 25.1 months (IQR 15.5–33.4). After a maximum follow-up of 30 months, there were fewer recurrences in the mesh group than in the suture group (six [4%] in 146 patients vs 17 [12%] in 138 patients; 2-year actuarial estimates of recurrence 3.6% [95% CI 1.4–9.4] vs 11.4% (6.8–18.9); p = 0.01, hazard ratio 0.31, 95% CI 0.12–0.80, corresponding to a number needed to treat of 12.8). The most common postoperative complications were seroma (one [< 1%] in the suture group vs five [3%] in the mesh group), haematoma (two [1%] vs three [2%]), and wound infection (one [< 1%] vs three [2%]). There were no anaesthetic complications or postoperative deaths.

Interpretation

This is the first study showing high level evidence for mesh repair in patients with small hernias of diameter 1–4 cm. Hence we suggest mesh repair should be used for operations on all patients with an umbilical hernia of this size.

### Amyand's hernia: a case report [^13d347d9]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Amyand's hernia is a rare and atypical hernia characterized by the herniation of the appendix into the inguinal sac. This hernia may be present without symptoms until inflammation of the appendix may lead to incarceration, strangulation, necrosis, perforation or rupture. Early symptoms include tenderness and inguinal swelling which may be misdiagnosed as a strangulated hernia. This condition can be difficult to diagnose clinically. Ultrasound and Computed Tomography may aid in diagnosis. This article presents a rare case of Amyand's hernia followed by a discussion of the epidemiology, diagnosis, imaging details and treatment options for this condition.

### Evidence-based, cost-effective management of abdominal wall hernias: an algorithm of the journal of trauma and acute care surgery emergency general surgery algorithms work group [^5195b59b]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

INITIAL EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT

The workup for a patient with concerns of a ventral abdominal wall or groin hernia begins with a thorough history and physical examination (Figs. 1). It is essential that the physical examination include all potential sites of abdominal wall hernia, including the groin and perineal areas, especially in patients with more vague presenting symptoms. Incarcerated hernias, especially in the groin, can be easily missed by a more superficial examination. After the diagnosis of a hernia has been made, the specific location, surgical history, associated symptoms, and patient-specific factors will help determine the appropriate next steps in management. History should focus on the duration of symptoms, prior episodes of hernia incarceration, past surgical history, and evidence of systemic signs of illness, including fever, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, or skin changes overlying the hernia. Physical examination should evaluate the location of the hernia, the size of the fascial defect, the presence of hernia incarceration, and any redness or ecchymosis of the overlying skin. For a well-defined localized fascial defect, adding imaging to the initial diagnostic workup is of unclear benefit and is not mandatory. If there are concerns for a complicated abdominal wall hernia, based on either patient factors or hernia variables, additional workup should be considered, and laboratory evaluation should be obtained to include a basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and lactate.
The determination of the need and urgency for surgical repair will depend on multiple factors. Patients with a reducible hernia, improvement in symptoms, no evidence of complications, and an otherwise normal physical examination should be referred for outpatient surgical follow-up to discuss elective hernia repair. Patients with concern for abdominal wall hernia complications, including strangulation, intestinal obstruction, hernia incarceration, unrelieved severe pain, overlying skin changes, or evidence of systemic illness, should be seen by an acute care surgeon. Ideally, surgical evaluation should precede imaging in patients with nonreducible hernias and worrisome findings on physical examination.
Patients with an incarcerated hernia and concern for strangulation or presence of peritonitis require prompt surgical intervention, as increased time from onset of symptoms to operative intervention is associated with an increased need for bowel resection. Signs of bowel incarceration causing obstruction (nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, and obstipation), in addition to severe pain at the hernia site, are suggestive of strangulation. Systemic signs of strangulation may include hypotension and tachycardia, with elevations in serum lactate (> 2.0 mmol/L) and white blood cell often (although not definitively) found on initial laboratory evaluation. Physical examination may also show erythema or bruising/discoloration of the skin overlying the hernia. When these findings are present, or the patient is otherwise deemed at risk for strangulation within the hernia, an emergent exploration should be undertaken, with assessment of the viability of involved bowel, reduction of the hernia, and definitive hernia repair if practical. In many cases, imaging is not required and may lead to unnecessary delay. Similar to other EGS procedures, patients requiring acute urgent operation for hernia complications are at increased risk of complication compared with their elective counterparts.
In circumstances of diagnostic uncertainty or a difficult-to-interpret examination (as can be found in obesity), imaging should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate for high-risk imaging features associated with strangulation. While ultrasound can be used to help with the initial diagnosis, cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography scan is preferred. Even when the diagnosis of hernia is confidently made on physical examination, computed tomography imaging can provide useful clinical information on the fascial defect size and hernia contents to evaluate for signs of intestinal obstruction or ischemia. In the absence of a high index of suspicion for strangulation, attempts should be made to reduce an incarcerated abdominal wall hernia unless it is known that the patient has had a chronically nonreducible incarcerated hernia. Acute hernia incarceration that is not reducible should prompt urgent operative intervention to reduce the hernia, evaluate for the viability of the incarcerated bowel, and repair the hernia defect.
Acutely incarcerated hernias that are reducible but have high-risk features (Table 1) on imaging or physical examination should favor urgent repair (defined as nonemergent but performed during the index admission). These features are related to the patient's presentation and imaging findings. Clinical high-risk features include persistent abdominal pain after reduction or persistent nausea/vomiting. Radiographic findings associated with a higher risk for hernia complications should be considered when determining the need for urgent surgery in patients without clear signs of strangulation. Beyond the typical signs of bowel ischemia (e.g. pneumatosis, portal venous gas, or free air), the presence of fluid within the hernia sac, a transition point of the bowel at the neck of the hernia, bowel thickening within the hernia, and inflammatory stranding in the tissue along the hernia are considered high-risk features.
While repair of a hernia on initial presentation may be ideal, patient factors or local capacity may not permit this to be reasonably performed in all settings. Patient-specific factors should be considered, including age, frailty, American Society of Anesthesia score, and preadmission anticoagulant use, as each of these variables is associated with an increased risk of complications. – Some patients with hernias that exhibit a higher risk of recurrence may be discharged but with a defined plan to repair it in the short term to minimize patients' loss of follow-up. Variables associated with a higher risk of recurrence include clinical factors and radiographic features of the hernia (Table 2). Acute onset and escalation of symptoms should be considered potential reasons to hasten repair. The need for conscious sedation to achieve a successful visceral reduction marks patients as higher risk, and they should undergo expedited repair (when performed within 4 weeks, reincarceration rates of ~2% have been reported). High-risk anatomical features include certain types of hernias with femoral and Spigelian hernias exhibiting a higher incarceration rate and need for emergent repair; therefore, these should be addressed promptly. Women with groin hernia have a higher risk of requiring emergent surgery compared with men, especially if a femoral hernia is present. The size of the fascial defect is an unreliable predictor of the need for urgent repair, but primary hernia defects between 3 and 4 cm are at higher overall risk of incarceration compared with smaller or larger defects (with a rate of 10%; odds ratio, 3.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.91–5.74; p < 0.0001). Specific measurements comparing the width of a fascial defect and the height of the hernia sack can also be used to estimate an increased risk with a "mushrooming hernia", one with a narrow neck as compared with height creating an acute angle with the abdominal wall being associated with a higher risk of requiring emergent surgery (odds ratio, 6.12; 95% confidence interval, 2.24–20.00). Similarly, a study by James et al.identified the ratio of hernia size to fascial defect (neck) as a potential aid in surgical decision-making, finding that a hernia-to-neck ratio > 2.5 predicted the need for emergent repair. Patients presenting to the ED with acute abdominal wall hernia symptoms who do not have an indication for urgent surgery are at high risk of being lost to follow-up. A prior multicenter study of patients with an ED visit for hernia-related symptoms showed that over 50% did not follow up in the outpatient clinic, with 20% returning to the ED with additional hernia-related complaints. Considering socioeconomic factors and health care disparities to determine the need for operative intervention at the index admission will address low clinic follow-up rates and prevent future ED resource utilization. When immediate repair is not required, an effort should be made to ensure follow-up and initiate planning for definitive repair before the patient is discharged from the ED or the inpatient setting. The ability to follow-up in the outpatient clinic and access to elective, outpatient surgery should also be considered.
Nonurgent repair or repair after patient optimization prior to surgery can be pursued for symptomatic hernias without high-risk features. These patients can likely be safely discharged from the ED with elective outpatient follow-up. If modifiable patient risk factors are identified at the time of hernia diagnosis (such as smoking, need for weight loss, or control of diabetes), these should be addressed before surgery. If the hernia is deemed complex, its eventual repair should be scheduled when patient optimization has been achieved and performed by a surgeon experienced in complex abdominal wall reconstruction techniques. Prediction of the need for component separation can be a subjective determination or made in various ways using data from cross-sectional imaging comparing aspects of the hernia to the remaining abdominal wall. Watchful waiting and outpatient follow-up may be considered for asymptomatic ventral, inguinal, and umbilical hernias found incidentally on imaging. While these have a reasonably high rate of requiring an eventual repair, it is likely safe to monitor these hernias after the patient has received counseling on monitoring the hernia for symptoms in the future.

### Incarceration of umbilical hernia: a rare complication of large volume paracentesis [^c786c494]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

We present two cases of umbilical hernia incarceration following large volume paracentesis (LVP) in patients with cirrhotic ascites. Both patients became symptomatic within 48 hours after the LVP. Although being rare, given the significantly higher mortality rate of cirrhotic patients undergoing emergent herniorrhaphy, this complication of LVP is potentially serious. Therefore, it is recommended that patients be examined closely for the presence of umbilical hernias before removal of ascitic fluid and an attempt should be made for external reduction of easily reducible hernias, if a hernia is present.

Results

A total of 15 KQs were formulated that were further synthesized into 13 questions due to significant overlap after analysis was performed.

The results for each of these is presented below along with 'recommendations' if there was sufficient quality of evidence or a 'good practice statement' where the quality of evidence was insufficient to make a formal recommendation. The detailed search strategies for each KQ are shown in Table S1. For each KQ a detailed Summary of Findings table, which details the number of studies analysed, the certainty assessment (including risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision), the number of patients with and without exposure, the relative and absolute effect size, and the certainty of evidence, is included in each section's Summary of Findings Table.

Key Question 1: What are the risk factors for developing an incisional hernia after previous abdominal surgery?

Good Practice Statement A: Patients should be advised that high BMI, smoking, diabetes, and immunosuppression are risk factors for developing an incisional hernia after abdominal surgery.

Good Practice Statement B: Surgeons should be aware that midline incisions have a higher risk of incisional hernia than off-midline incisions.

Good Practice Statement C: Surgeons should be aware that single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS), trocar sites 10 mm and larger, and umbilical site trocars have a higher risk of incisional hernia (trocar-site hernias).

Good Practice Statement D: Surgeons should be advised that the combination of a continuous small-bites suturing technique with a slowly absorbable suture reduces the risk of incisional hernia.

Good Practice Statement E: Surgeons should be aware that surgical site infection (SSI) after abdominal surgery is a risk factor for developing an incisional hernia and appears to have the biggest impact when compared with other risk factors.

It is important to be aware of potential modifiable risk factors so that patients can be pre-optimized where possible before elective abdominal surgery. In addition, in both emergency and elective settings, awareness of risk factors for incisional hernia may influence closure technique and the potential use of prophylactic mesh for high-risk patients.

### The use of porcine small intestinal submucosa as a prosthetic material for laparoscopic hernia repair in infected and potentially contaminated fields: long-term follow-up [^1342afe8]. Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

The treatment of hernias remains controversial, with multiple prosthetic meshes being exalted for a variety of their characteristics. In the event of incarcerated/strangulated hernias and other potentially contaminated fields the placement of prosthetic material remains controversial because of increased risk of recurrence and infection. Porcine small intestinal submucosa mesh (Surgisis, Cook Bloomington, IN) has been demonstrated safe and feasible in laparoscopic hernia repairs in this scenario. We present our 5-year experience, with placement of Surgisis mesh in potentially or grossly contaminated fields.

Methods

From May 2000 to October 2006, 116 patients (52 male, 64 female) with 133 procedures were performed. Placement of Surgisis mesh for either incisional, umbilical, inguinal, femoral or parastomal hernia repairs in an infected or potentially contaminated setting were achieved, and studied in a prospective fashion.

Results

All procedures were laparoscopically with two techniques [intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) and two-layered "sandwich" repair]. Mean follow-up was 52 ± 20.9 months. Thirty-nine cases were in an infected field and the rest in a potentially contaminated field. Ninety-one procedures were performed concurrently with a contaminated procedure. Twenty-five presented as intestinal obstruction, 16 strangulated hernias, and 17 required small bowel resection; 29 were inguinal hernias, 57 incisional, and 38 umbilical. In 13 patients more than two different hernias were repaired. Eighty-five percent 5-year follow-up was achieved, during which we identified 7 recurrences, 11 seromas (all resolved), and 10 patients reporting mild pain. Six second looks were performed and in all cases except one the mesh was found to be totally integrated into the tissue with strong scar tissue corroborated macro- and microscopically.

Conclusions

In our experience the use of small intestine submucosa mesh in contaminated or potentially contaminated fields is a safe and feasible alternative to hernia repair with minimal recurrence rate and satisfactory results in long-term follow-up.

### Right paraduodenal hernia leading to bowel strangulation [^cfff93e5]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Up to half of all internal hernias are caused by paraduodenal hernia, a rare congenital midgut malrotation that accounts for less than 1% of all intestinal obstructions. The diagnosis may arise from an incidental finding on abdominal imaging or the patient may present with abdominal pain, vomiting, and obstipation. Early recognition and management of this disease entity are keys because serious complications such as bowel ischemia and infarction may result from a delay in diagnosis. We present a case involving a 14-year-old boy with gangrenous small bowel secondary to right paraduodenal hernia.

### Internal hernia as a cause for intestinal obstruction in a newborn [^aee6c118]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

An internal hernia is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction, which can occur at any age. Children most often develop an internal hernia due to a congenital defect in the mesentery. While some patients are asymptomatic, others present to medical attention with vague abdominal symptoms, an acute abdomen, or in shock.

Case Report

We report a case of a 5-day-old previously healthy baby who presented to our pediatric emergency department with bilious vomiting, grossly bloody stool, and abdominal distention. During an exploratory laparotomy, the patient was diagnosed with an internal hernia caused by a congenital mesenteric defect. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Although internal hernia is an infrequent cause of intestinal obstruction in a newborn and requires emergent operative repair, it may be mistaken for other more common causes, such as necrotizing entercolitis, which are often managed medically. This case report aims to highlight some of the difficulties in diagnosis and key features that may assist the clinician in identifying these patients.

### Predictors of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia in children [^471cd7a2]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aims were to describe the management of umbilical hernias, to define postoperative complications, and to identify the characteristics of patients that were more likely to have spontaneous resolution of their hernia.

Methods

All patients referred for umbilical hernia at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario from January 1990 to April 2017 were examined via retrospective chart review. Spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia was examined using binary logistic regression.

Results

We included 2621 patients presenting with an umbilical hernia. A total of 1587 (60.5%) patients underwent surgical repair at a median age of 3.6 years (IQR 2.3–5.4). Surgical complications consisted of infection (n = 3), bleeding (n = 3), hematoma (n = 3), and anesthesia-related complications (n = 3). For every one-unit increase in defect size, the odds of a spontaneous resolution of the hernia were 5% lower while controlling for prematurity and the presence of comorbidities [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.95; 95% confidence intervel (CI) 0.93 to 0.97]. Premature babies were 80% less likely to experience hernia resolution compared with non-premature babies (aOR = 0.20; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.74).

Conclusion

The odds of spontaneous resolution were lower for premature babies and were negatively correlated with defect size.

### Avoid referring most children with umbilical hernias to a pediatric… [^a1449be0]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with umbilical hernias may safely be observed until at least age four years; at that point, pediatric surgical consultation is recommended to discuss surgical repair option. Special consideration for earlier consultation can be given in cases of parental concern. Umbilical hernias, resulting from failure of complete closure of the umbilical ring after birth, affect up to 25% of newborns. Unlike inguinal hernias, or umbilical hernias in adults, a majority of newborn umbilical hernias will close spontaneously – about 85% closure rate by age five years. Larger umbilical hernias – vaguely defined as those over 1. 5 cm in diameter – have a lower likelihood of spontaneous closure. Complications of umbilical hernia, such as incarceration or strangulation are very rare; thus, the risk/benefit ratio in surgical closure of umbilical hernias strongly favors observation. Even markedly large or protuberant umbilical hernias may undergo spontaneous closure and are not clearly associated with an increased risk of complications when not surgically closed. Nonoperative closure techniques such as umbilical strapping are generally ineffective, can lead to skin breakdown, and should be avoided. Complications following umbilical hernia repair in children are rare and may include infection and recurrence. Recurrence rates appear to be higher in children repaired at an early age.

### The hernia-neck-ratio (HNR), a novel predictive factor for complications of umbilical hernia [^aaeb4836]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Umbilical hernia is a common pathology and surgical repair is advised to prevent complications in symptomatic patients. However, risk factors that predict such advert events are unknown. The aim of the study was to determine whether morphological characteristics are associated with the occurrence of complications.

Method

Retrospective review of adult patients with elective and emergent umbilical hernia repair operated from January 2004 to December 2013. The size of the hernia and the size of the neck were measured based on operative reports, ultrasound, CT or MRI images. The Hernia-Neck-Ratio (HNR) was then calculated as novel risk indicator.

Results

106 patients underwent umbilical hernia repair (70 for uncomplicated and 36 for complicated hernia) as single procedure. The median size of the hernia sac was statistically significantly smaller in the uncomplicated group (30 mm, interquartile range (IQR) 20–49 vs. 50 mm, IQR 40–71, p = 0.037). The median size of the neck was not different between both groups (15 mm, IQR 11–29 vs. 16 mm, IQR 12–21, p = 0.44). The median HNR was smaller in the uncomplicated group (1.76, IQR 1.45–2.18 vs. 3.33, IQR 2.97–3.91, p = 0.00026). Based on ROC curve analysis (area under the curve: 0.9038), a cut-off value of 2.5 was associated with 91% sensitivity and 84% specificity.

Conclusions

A novel predictive factor for complications related to umbilical hernia is proposed. The Hernia-Neck Ratio can easily be calculated. These results suggest that umbilical hernia with HNR > 2.5 should be operated, irrespective of the presence of symptoms.

### Incarcerated umbilical hernia leading to small bowel ischemia [^5129e09e]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

A 59-year-old male with history of hepatitis C, refractory ascites requiring multiple paracentesis and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement presented to the emergency department with 2 days of abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed blood pressure of 104/66 and pulse of 94. The abdomen was remarkable for distention and a tender incarcerated umbilical hernia. The skin overlying the hernia was pale with areas of necrosis. The patient immediately underwent laparotomy which was successful.
