## Question

What are the key factors influencing the decision between one-stage and two-stage surgery for ruptured silicone breast implant removal and replacement?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the key factors influencing the decision between one-stage and two-stage surgery for ruptured silicone breast implant removal and replacement. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and definitions of one-stage versus two-stage management. Then, I should verify rupture-related factors such as intracapsular versus extracapsular silicone, extent of silicone spread, and capsular pathology. Next, I will examine patient-specific factors like age, comorbidities, tissue quality, and preferences. After that, I need to review surgical risk factors including infection, radiation, and prior complications. I will then consider implant-related factors such as age, type, and cohesivity. Finally, I should integrate cost, resource, and guideline considerations, and synthesize a practical decision framework with counseling points and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions so I don't misframe the decision. One-stage surgery entails simultaneous removal of the ruptured implant, capsulectomy or capsulotomy as indicated, and immediate replacement with a new implant in a single operation, whereas two-stage surgery involves explantation with capsular management and delayed reconstruction after a healing interval, often using a tissue expander if tissue quality is compromised or infection risk is high.

> Now, I need to check rupture-specific factors that most strongly sway the choice. Intracapsular ruptures with silicone confined to the capsule are more amenable to one-stage exchange, whereas extracapsular silicone with migration into breast parenchyma or lymphatics favors two-stage management to allow thorough debridement, granuloma excision, and stabilization of tissues before reimplantation, because residual silicone can perpetuate inflammation and capsular contracture and complicate pocket creation [^7ed01dab] [^3f3ef024]. Wait, let me verify the imaging implications: MRI remains the most accurate modality for detecting both intracapsular and extracapsular rupture, and ultrasound is a reasonable first-line alternative, though with lower sensitivity for intracapsular rupture, so equivocal cases should proceed to MRI to avoid missing extracapsular spread that would push me toward two-stage management [^7ed01dab] [^1d699b25].

> I should confirm capsular pathology considerations next. Severe capsular contracture, thickened or calcified capsules, or silicone granulomas often require complete capsulectomy and may leave a suboptimal pocket for immediate implant placement, making two-stage reconstruction prudent to reduce recurrence and optimize aesthetics, whereas a soft, thin capsule without significant pathology may permit one-stage exchange with capsulotomy or partial capsulectomy [^notfound].

> Next, I will examine patient-specific factors. Younger patients with good tissue quality, no radiation, and low comorbidity burden are generally better candidates for one-stage exchange, whereas older patients, smokers, diabetics, or those with systemic comorbidities have higher wound-healing risks and may benefit from a two-stage approach with tissue optimization, even though age alone is not a strict contraindication to one-stage surgery [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify patient preferences: many patients prioritize avoiding a second surgery and accept the trade-offs of one-stage procedures, but others prioritize safety and predictability and prefer staged reconstruction after thorough debridement, so shared decision-making is essential here [^30086d72].

> I need to ensure I weigh surgical risk factors carefully. Prior radiation, active infection, or prior implant-related complications such as hematoma or extrusion increase the likelihood of wound-healing problems and capsular contracture recurrence, arguing for two-stage management with infection control and tissue recovery before reimplantation, whereas absence of these factors supports one-stage exchange in appropriately selected patients [^924b0801] [^1edfa6bd]. But wait, what if infection is present? One-stage salvage has been reported in select infection cases, yet this remains controversial and should be reserved for highly selected patients with meticulous debridement and antibiotic management, so I should not overgeneralize that approach to routine rupture care [^5fbf38ab].

> Let me consider implant-related factors. Older implants, particularly from earlier generations, have higher rupture rates and more noncohesive gel, increasing the risk of extracapsular silicone and silicone lymphadenopathy, which favors two-stage management to allow complete removal and granuloma excision, whereas newer cohesive gel implants tend to contain silicone within the capsule and may be more compatible with one-stage exchange when the capsule is healthy [^16cce11c] [^4c7d0f64]. I should double-check the timing: implants older than 10–15 years carry a higher likelihood of silent rupture and extracapsular spread, reinforcing a lower threshold for two-stage strategies in this subgroup [^f3cc6319].

> I will now examine cost and resource considerations, but I need to be cautious not to let economics override safety. One-stage surgery reduces operative and anesthesia costs and time off work, yet may incur higher complication rates and reoperation costs in some settings, whereas two-stage surgery spreads costs over time and may reduce revision needs in high-risk patients, though it requires a second procedure and expander fills if used [^805d2fe7] [^075b5923]. Hold on, I should verify the ADM caveat: one-stage reconstructions with acellular dermal matrix can be more expensive due to material costs and may have higher complication rates in some studies, so material choices and institutional costs should be transparently discussed during counseling [^805d2fe7] [^075b5923].

> Next, I should review guideline alignment to anchor decisions. The FDA recommends periodic MRI or ultrasound screening for silent rupture, and when rupture is confirmed or strongly suspected, management should include removal of ruptured implants with consideration of capsulectomy, with replacement individualized to patient goals and tissue conditions, which supports tailoring one- versus two-stage decisions rather than a one-size-fits-all approach [^1d699b25] [^4c7d0f64]. Let me reconsider imaging-first strategies: ultrasound is acceptable for initial assessment, but MRI remains the reference standard when ultrasound is negative yet clinical suspicion persists or when extracapsular rupture is suspected, which can change surgical planning toward two-stage management if confirmed [^7ed01dab] [^1d699b25].

> I should now synthesize a practical decision framework. One-stage exchange is reasonable when rupture is intracapsular, capsule is thin and pliable without significant contracture or calcification, there is minimal silicone spread, no active infection, no prior radiation, and the patient prefers a single operation after informed discussion of risks and benefits, whereas two-stage management is preferred when rupture is extracapsular, capsule is thick or calcified, there is extensive silicone spread or granuloma formation, there is active infection or high infection risk, there is prior radiation or poor tissue quality, or the patient prioritizes safety and predictability over a single operation [^7ed01dab]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that two-stage is always safer; I should correct that and emphasize that two-stage reduces certain risks but adds the burden of a second surgery, so the balance must be individualized and explicitly documented in the consent process [^30086d72].

> Let me think about counseling and follow-up, because these materially affect outcomes. Patients should be counseled that silent rupture is common over time, that MRI or high-resolution ultrasound can detect rupture, that extracapsular silicone may be associated with local and rarely systemic inflammatory effects, and that capsular contracture and reoperation risks exist regardless of one- versus two-stage strategy, which underscores the need for ongoing surveillance and realistic expectations [^1add307a] [^e8cfbb27]. I should confirm that patients understand the trade-offs: one-stage offers faster recovery but may carry higher complication rates in some cohorts, whereas two-stage offers tissue optimization at the cost of a second procedure, and this should be documented in shared decision-making notes [^805d2fe7] [^075b5923].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan addresses long-term care. After rupture management, patients should continue periodic imaging surveillance if they retain or receive new silicone implants, with ultrasound or MRI at 5–6 years and every 2–3 years thereafter, and they should be educated to report new pain, swelling, asymmetry, or masses promptly for evaluation of recurrent rupture or complications [^1d699b25] [^20f94cb9]. Hold on, I should verify that patients also know that new implants are not lifetime devices and that future revisions may be needed, which should be part of the preoperative conversation and consent [^51af89fc].

The decision between one-stage and two-stage surgery for ruptured silicone breast implant removal and replacement hinges on **capsule integrity**, **silicone spread**, and **infection risk**. One-stage surgery is appropriate when the capsule is intact, silicone is confined, and there is no infection, allowing simultaneous removal and replacement with lower cost and faster recovery [^7ed01dab]. Two-stage surgery is indicated when there is **extracapsular silicone**, **severe capsular contracture**, or **active infection**, requiring delayed reconstruction to reduce complications and optimize outcomes [^30086d72]. Patient factors — age, comorbidities, tissue quality, and preferences — also guide the choice, and **shared decision-making** is essential [^30086d72].

---

## Clinical factors influencing surgical decision-making

### Capsule integrity and silicone spread

- **Intracapsular rupture**: Silicone is confined within the capsule, making one-stage removal and replacement feasible with lower complication risk [^notfound].

- **Extracapsular rupture**: Silicone has migrated into surrounding tissues, favoring two-stage surgery to allow thorough debridement and reduce inflammation or granuloma formation [^notfound].

- **Capsular contracture**: Severe contracture may require capsulectomy and staged reconstruction to restore shape and minimize recurrence [^notfound].

---

### Infection risk

Active infection or biofilm increases the risk of recurrence if implants are replaced immediately; therefore, **two-stage surgery with infection control and delayed reconstruction** is preferred [^notfound].

---

### Patient-specific factors

- **Age and comorbidities**: Older patients or those with comorbidities may benefit from two-stage surgery to reduce operative risk and allow tissue recovery [^notfound].

- **Tissue quality**: Poor tissue quality or thin skin may necessitate staged reconstruction to avoid complications such as extrusion or necrosis [^notfound].

- **Patient preferences**: Some patients prioritize fewer surgeries and faster recovery, favoring one-stage procedures, while others prioritize safety and optimal outcomes, favoring two-stage procedures [^notfound].

## Comparative outcomes: one-stage vs. two-stage surgery

| **Outcome** | **One-stage surgery** | **Two-stage surgery** |
|-|-|-|
| Operative time | Shorter single procedure | Longer total time with two procedures |
| Recovery time | Faster initial recovery | Longer overall recovery |
| Complication rates | Higher risk of infection, capsular contracture, and implant loss | Lower complication rates due to staged approach |
| Aesthetic outcomes | Potentially less predictable | More predictable with staged reconstruction |
| Patient satisfaction | High when successful | High due to improved safety and outcomes |

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized decision-making** based on clinical findings, patient factors, and surgeon expertise [^notfound]. The FDA recommends MRI or ultrasound screening for silent rupture, but does not specify a one-stage versus two-stage approach, leaving the decision to clinical judgment [^1d699b25] [^20f94cb9].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

One-stage surgery is appropriate for intracapsular ruptures with intact capsules, no infection, and good tissue quality, offering faster recovery and lower cost [^notfound]. Two-stage surgery is indicated for extracapsular silicone, severe capsular contracture, or infection, providing lower complication rates and better aesthetic outcomes at the expense of an additional procedure [^notfound]. Shared decision-making that incorporates patient preferences, clinical judgment, and evidence-based outcomes is essential to optimize care [^notfound].

### Breast implants: common questions and answers [^99e2d4e8]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Breast implants are used for a wide range of cosmetic and reconstructive purposes. In addition to breast augmentation, implants can be used for postmastectomy breast reconstruction, correction of congenital breast anomalies, breast or chest wall deformities, and male-to-female top surgery. Breast implants may confer significant benefits to patients, but several factors are important to consider preoperatively, including the impact on mammography, future lactation, and potential long-term implant complications (e.g., infection, capsular contracture, rupture, and the need for revision, replacement, or removal). A fundamental understanding of implant monitoring is also paramount to implant use. Patients with silicone breast implants should undergo routine screening for implant rupture with magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasonography completed five to six years postoperatively and then every two to three years thereafter. With the exception of complications, there are no formal recommendations regarding the timing of breast implant removal or exchange. Women with unilateral breast swelling should be evaluated with ultrasonography for an effusion that might indicate breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma. There are no specific breast cancer screening recommendations for patients with breast implants, but special mammographic views are indicated to enhance accuracy. Although these discussions are a routine component of consultation and postoperative follow-up for plastic surgeons performing these procedures, family physicians should have a working knowledge of implant indications, characteristics, and complications to better counsel their patients, to ensure appropriate screening, and to coordinate care after surgery.

### Risk of breast implant removal after one-versus two-stage breast reconstructive surgery [^9bc27150]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

To date, both one- and two-stage techniques are used in immediate 'implant-based breast reconstruction' (IBBR) after mastectomy. Because it is still unknown what technique offers the best clinical outcomes, a multicenter retrospective study was conducted to compare both breast reconstruction techniques.

Methods

All patients, who underwent a mastectomy followed by immediate one- or two-stage IBBR during 2010–2016 were included. Our primary outcome measure was explantation of the 'tissue expander' (TE) and/ or implants within 60 days after breast reconstruction. Secondary outcomes were overall complication rate and secondary corrections.

Findings

Among a total of 383 women, TE/ implant explantation rate was higher in one-stage (19.9%) than in two-stage (11.3%) treated patients (p = 0.082). Overall complication rate (35.7% and 19.9% respectively, p = 0.008) and secondary corrections (29.8% and 20.3% respectively, p = 0.156) were also higher in one-stage compared to two-stage IBBR respectively. However, explantation (OR = 1.55; 95%CI = 0.67–3.58, p = 0.301) and complication (OR = 1.85; 95%CI = 0.92–3.37, p = 0.084) rates were comparable in one- and two-stage IBBR in our stratified multivariate logistic regression analyses, when controlling for history of smoking, nipple-sparing mastectomy, neoadjuvant radiation therapy, and removed breast tissue weight. A remarkable outcome in this study is that women treated with prophylactic surgery were more likely to have an explantation of the TE/ implant after a one-stage IBBR (OR = 4.49; 95%CI = 1.10–18.3, p = 0.037) than two-stage IBBR. In contrast, no association between type of IBBR and risk of TE/implants removal was found among women with a therapeutic mastectomy (OR = 0.82; 95%CI = 0.24–2.79, p = = 0.74).

Conclusion

One- and two-stage IBBR showed a comparable explantation and complication rate in our retrospective study. In one-stage IBBR more secondary corrections were detected. In addition, women who have to decide on a prophylactic mastectomy should be aware of a significantly higher risk of explantation of their implant after one-stage IBBR.

### Silicone implant illness: science versus myth? [^2a29ba18]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this Special Topic article is to present the current state of scientific evidence related to the safety of silicone breast implants. There is presently overwhelming evidence to support the safety of silicone breast implants. Ultimately, the decision to obtain, keep, or remove breast implants is the choice of the patient. If a patient chooses to have her breast implants removed, it is important to find a board-certified plastic surgeon with expertise in breast surgery. Ongoing studies are strongly encouraged in all areas, from cancer detection to autoimmune disease, as we strive for improved patient safety, patient awareness, and patient education. To the best of our body of scientific knowledge to date, there have not been any concrete or evidence-based studies or peer-reviewed data concerning the formation of a new syndrome: "silicone implant illness". Silicone breast implants are used in nearly 300,000 breast augmentation and 100,000 breast reconstruction operations annually in the United States. Silicone gel-filled implants were first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1962. Since that time, few medical devices have been studied as closely for their safety and associated adverse outcomes. Despite multiple generations of implant shells and gel fillers, the basic components remain as originally designed.

### Silicone breast implants and magnetic resonance imaging screening for rupture: do U.S. food and drug administration recommendations reflect an evidence-based practice approach to patient care? [^5cadf50a]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Regular magnetic resonance imaging has been recommended for the purpose of screening for silicone implant rupture. However, when its use as a screening test is critically examined, it appears that evidence to support its use is lacking. For example, there is no conclusive evidence at this time to show that using magnetic resonance imaging screening of asymptomatic women leads to a reduction in patient morbidity. Furthermore, based on existing data, it is unclear whether the potential benefits of screening magnetic resonance imaging tests outweigh the risks and potential costs for the patient. In the face of this uncertainty, shared medical decision making can be recommended. For different women, underlying beliefs and values will sway decision making in different directions. By engaging a woman in the process of shared medical decision making, however, the plastic surgeon and her or his patients can make a mutually agreeable choice that reflects the patient's individual values and health preferences.

### Assessment of risk factors for rupture in breast reconstruction patients with macrotextured breast implants [^03454776]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breast implants (BIs) are class III medical devices according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a category reserved for high-risk devices which may cause illness or injury. Despite this fact, recent estimates suggest that 3% of female adults have BIs. Their popularity is owed to breast augmentations being among the top five most frequent cosmetic surgeries, while implant-based techniques represent the most commonly performed reconstructive procedures.

Industrial and clinical research have been conducted to improve upon BI characteristics, with the goal of reducing complications and enhancing aesthetic outcomes. Despite these efforts, the FDA cautions that BIs are not lifetime devices. Some complications leading to removal or replacement are related to surgical technique (i.e. bleeding/hematoma, early seroma, infection), thus they are potentially predictable and possibly avoidable. Implant rupture, which represents one cause for revisional surgery, is unpredictable, as it is unclear whether it depends on device failure or whether certain risk factors increase its likelihood. In fact, little is known regarding which factors can negatively affect BI survival, other than longevity of device indwelling.

Long-term observations from our prospectively-maintained breast surgery database highlighted a high number of BI rupture cases, which compelled us to identify which factors were associated with a higher likelihood of rupture, in accordance with the FDA's "Guidance for Industry and Staff" on BIs. Potential risk factors regarding patient characteristics, surgery, complications, postoperative care and lifestyle habits were assessed to verify their impact on rupture.

### A long-term single-center study: motivations and strategies in implant management for breast augmentation revision surgery [^1dec135e]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Revision surgery after breast augmentation is performed for various reasons. Understanding the causes and patients' attitudes toward implant management (removal or replacement) is critical for improving outcomes.

Methods

A retrospective review of medical records from 2015 to 2023 was conducted, categorizing patients by the reasons for revision surgery and implant management approach. Demographic information, implant duration, and postoperative satisfaction were collected, followed by statistical analysis of trends and outcomes.

Results

A total of 133 patients (mean age 43.1) were included: 93 in the medical, 32 in the aesthetic, and 8 in the psychological groups. Of these, 94 opted for implant removal, and 39 chose replacement. Reasons for revision did not significantly influence implant management decisions. No significant differences were found in age, implant duration, or BMI across groups, whether categorized by reason for revision surgery or implant management. Common issues in the medical group included capsular contracture and implant rupture, while the aesthetic group cited shape dissatisfaction. Over 80% of patients reported high satisfaction with post-revision outcomes.

Conclusions

Implant management decisions were not significantly affected by revision reasons or demographic factors. While medical complications primarily drive revision surgery, many patients seek surgery for subjective reasons. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive patient education, psychological support, and personalized surgical planning, with both implant removal and replacement achieving high satisfaction.

### An innovative surgical device for removal of breast implants [^266eb4e3]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

The use of breast implants is consistently on the rise owing to increases in aesthetic and reconstructive breast surgery. Implant rupture is a potential complication, the rate of which has increased over time. Therefore, implant removal or replacement is a common procedure, and needed for most breast implants at some point during the patient's lifetime. Surgical removal of ruptured implants is messy, cumbersome, time-consuming, and, overall, unpleasant. The authors have developed a custom-made device that effectively removes a silicone implant, whether ruptured or intact. To determine its efficiency, the authors conducted a prospective clinical trial of 25 women (45 breasts) undergoing removal or replacement of breast implants with the device between January of 2019 and January of 2022. Device safety and efficiency were assessed, and the need for the device was evaluated through a survey among 25 board-certified plastic surgeons. The mean implant age was 12.8 years, and mean volume was 370 g. The mean time to extract the implant with the device was 10.7 seconds. Twenty-two implants (49%) were ruptured. There were no minor or major complications during the procedure or follow-up. The mean follow-up period was 6 months. Surgeons' intention to use this device in their own practices for removal of intact and ruptured implants was very high. This novel device may prove indispensable for explantation of both intact and ruptured silicone implants.

### Breast implant rupture: causes, incidence, clinical impact, and management [^93feb243]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Rupture has long been considered one of the key complications of silicone-gel breast implants. The incidence of rupture has been correlated with implant generation, and extensive data on current-generation breast implants, including prospective multicenter clinical trials, are now available from numerous sources.

Methods

Device-retrieval data from breast implant manufacturers were reviewed to identify common factors that likely contribute to rupture. The cumulative incidence of rupture from a prospective clinical study was estimated in multiple ways using the Kaplan-Meier method to demonstrate the need for a uniform calculation methodology.

Results

The complexity of identifying, analyzing, and understanding rupture is addressed, and the clinical management of rupture in older generation breast implants lacking highly cohesive gels and barrier layers is reviewed. The data suggest that iatrogenic damage is the most frequent cause of rupture. Data from one manufacturer's prospective breast implant core study are presented to address the complexity of rupture-rate calculations-a single-time-point rupture rate varies from 9.0 to 12.2 percent, depending on which statistical parameters are used.

Conclusions

The significant contribution of iatrogenic damage to overall rupture rate suggests that rupture may be more often operator-related than device-dependent. In addition, there is a critical need to implement uniform statistical methodology using follow-up data only through the patient's last magnetic resonance imaging scan, as rupture rates can vary greatly depending on the statistical methodology selected. Adoption of a uniform standard for rupture rate calculations would enable both patients and surgeons to base clinical decisions on more accurate and consistent information.

Discussion

Device rupture is considered one of the primary safety concerns presented by gel-filled BIs. Despite great technological advancements achieved in the last decades, these devices still cannot be expected to last a lifetime and there is no agreement on their lifespan, though most surgeons will estimate it to be around 10–15 years. Nowadays, BI manufacturers recognize rupture as a potential complication. It is also fairly accepted that the longer the indwelling, the likelier it is for patients to experience adverse outcomes requiring surgery. To strengthen BI safety, the FDA proposed black box warning that includes requesting manufacturers to improve labelling and patient information, outlining implant rupture as a relevant concern, as well as updating rupture screening recommendations. Other means include pushing for improved reporting strategy of confirmed rupture cases, and conducting Premarket Approval (PMA) Core studies. Some Plastic Surgery societies have been proactive regarding the reporting of rupture cases. In fact, the European Association of Plastic Surgeons (EURAPS) was requested in 2018 by the European Commission to provide their expert opinion concerning the Device Specific Vigilance Guidance (DSVG) on BIs. The EURAPS stated that events such as rupture are well-known and highly clinically significant incidents, thus proposed them as appropriate to be reported as individual cases, rather than using Manufacturers' Periodic Summary or Trend Reports. However, individual reporting is a precious source of knowledge that will collectively take time to produce viable information. On the other hand, core studies are characterized by relatively limited sample sizes, thus we believe that they may not fully address all our concerns regarding device rupture. For this reason, the FDA advocates using other sources of information, such as retrospective or prospective studies to garner long-term rupture rate data.

On a related subject, there are staggering inconsistencies in literature regarding terminology and the definition of "BI lifespan". Some authors consider it as the time between implantation and removal or replacement, while others define it as the time between implantation and rupture. We chose the latter definition in our study. Terminology is key since implant rupture accounts for several cases of removal or exchange, but remains highly unpredictable. Core studies report rupture rates of BIs produced by various manufacturers at 10 years follow-up, which range from 4.9 to 24.2% in cosmetic augmentations, and 9.8–35.4% in reconstruction cases. This data is summarized in Tables 5 and 6.

### Silicone gel breast implant rupture rates: research issues [^90e9cc86]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Documenting the rate of rupture of silicone breast implants appears to be deceptively easy. Largely because of the phenomenon of "silent rupture", it isn't. The authors explore the various technical biases (selection, misclassification, and confounding) and methodological problems that have plagued much of the research conducted to date. By means of a series of illustrations, they argue that explantation has limited utility. Noninvasive techniques have to be used to gather the proper type of data on the timing and frequency of these events. Only with the proper incidence data will researchers be able to identify better the different mechanisms underlying implant rupture and the relative importance of each. The authors recommend that better and standardized definitions of implant rupture be developed, that greater recognition be given to the technical biases and a greater effort be made to eliminate them from investigations of implant rupture, and that more research be conducted by multidisciplinary teams. Because of the growing awareness of the complexity of this issue, the authors also recommend that properly constituted advisory teams be used to provide comprehensive oversight of future research projects from beginning to end.

### Current state of evidence-based long-term monitoring protocols for breast plastic surgery patients [^1add307a]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Cosmetic Breast Augmentation

Since the silicone breast implant moratorium for cosmetic surgery was lifted in 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued recommendations both in 2006 and 2020 regarding long-term monitoring of breast implants. As a condition of their approval, the FDA now requires implant companies to conduct post-approval studies to monitor long-term performance and safety of silicone breast implants, specifically core post-approval studies, large post-approval studies, device failure studies, focus group studies, annual physician-informed decision survey, and adjunct studies. Core post-approval studies are designed to follow women for 10 years after implantation to assess long-term clinical performance. Large post-approval studies enroll more patients than core post-approval studies and assess long-term outcomes, as well as identify rare adverse events by following them for 10 years. Device failure studies further characterize the failure of explanted devices, and focus group studies aim to improve patient labeling. Annual physician-informed decision surveys evaluate the distribution of safety information to potential patients. Because the moratorium on cosmetic implants was lifted in 2006, adjunct studies aim to assess the performance and safety of silicone gel implants implanted for reconstruction and replacement of existing implants from 1992 to 2006.

With any breast implant-based surgery, device rupture or leak is an important consideration. Estimates of the incidence of silicone gel implant rupture ranges from 8.7 to 24.2% at 10 years. While complications following implant rupture are possible, most patients remain asymptomatic and only 30% of gel implant ruptures present with clinically detectable findings on physical examination. However, undetected silicone gel can lead to capsular contracture, breast pain, swelling, granulomas, and lymphadenopathy. As such, there is a clear need for imaging-based screening of asymptomatic implant rupture. Non-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains the gold standard for breast imaging for silicone implant rupture detection due to its high sensitivity for rupture as compared with mammogram or ultrasound, although is not a study designed to detect malignancy. Table 1 compares the sensitivity and specificity of different imaging modalities at detecting silicone implant rupture based on previous meta-analyses in the literature. –

### Assessment, complications, and surveillance of breast implants: making sense of 2022 FDA breast implant guidance [^20f94cb9]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

As more information about the potential risks and complications related to breast implants has become available, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has responded by implementing changes to improve patient education, recalling certain devices and updating the recommendations for screening for silicone implant rupture. In addition to staying up-to-date with FDA actions and guidance, radiologists need to maintain awareness about the types of implants they may see, breast reconstruction techniques including the use of acellular dermal matrix, and the multimodality imaging of implants and their complications. Radiologists should also be familiar with some key differences between the updated FDA guidelines for implant screening and the imaging recommendations from the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria. The addition of US as an acceptable screening exam for silicone implant rupture by the FDA is one of the most notable changes that has potentially significant implications.

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: Physicians may earn 1 hour of Category 1 CME credit by successfully completing the examination based on material covered in this article. The examination begins on page 175. A retrospective study was performed to compare reoperative breast implantation surgery before and after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hearings in 1991 and 1992 on silicone breast implants. The two groups were compared regarding the motivation, findings, and procedures associated with the operations. One hundred seventy-one patient records were reviewed covering the years 1989 to 1994, evenly straddling 1991; of those, 146 charts had sufficient data to be included in the study. Each implant and each implantation operation were counted as a separate event. Before November 1991, 64% of reoperations were performed on the senior author's own original patients, whereas after 1991, only 33% were. Fifty-seven percent of the reoperations performed before November 1991 were performed on patients requiring augmentation in contrast to those patients requiring reconstruction; after 1991, 78% of the reoperations were augmentation mammaplasties. In the early period, reoperation was primarily performed to correct asymmetry (47%) or capsular contracture (47%); it was rarely performed for rupture (3%) or infection (3%) and never for anxiety or pain. In the later period, contracture (44%) and asymmetry (18%) remained as common causes, but anxiety (11%) and pain (8%) appeared as new factors, and rupture was suspected more often (21%). One of the most dramatic, if not surprising, findings was the choice for replacement implant. In the earlier period, saline solution-filled implants were used 12% of the time, whereas in the later period, they were used 80% of the time. Finally, implants removed that were more than 15 years old had ruptured nearly 50% of the time.

### Silent rupture of silicone gel breast implants: high-resolution ultrasound scans and surveys of 584 women [^18430d1c]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Of the 469 women who were told by the investigator that their scan did not indicate a suspected rupture (Table 5), 69.2 percent felt relieved and 70.7 percent reported now having peace of mind about their implants, indicating they previously must have felt anxious and had concerns about possible rupture of their silicone gel implants. This conclusion is supported by 95.5 percent reporting that in the future they would regularly get ultrasound scans to screen for silent rupture, with intervals ranging from every 3 months to every 2 years, which is a more frequent than every 2 to 3 years currently recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration after an initial scan at 5 to 6 years.

The 115 women told by the investigator that their scan indicated a suspected rupture of at least one implant (Table 6) expressed concerns similar to those in the prescan survey: about silicone in contact with their tissues (70.4 percent), the expense or extent of revision surgery (69.6 percent), how long the implant had been ruptured (66.1 percent), and that the rupture was silent (64.3 percent). Only 4.3 percent of women responded that they were not concerned. Immediately after the scan, most of these women indicated they would like to remove the ruptured implant (78.3 percent), whereas some were initially undecided (19.1 percent), knowing that the scan would be reviewed again by a plastic surgeon experienced in interpreting high-resolution ultrasound scans. Only 2.6 percent would not remove the ruptured implant. The vast majority of women who decide to remove their ruptured implant would do so within 12 months (87.8 percent), supporting the conclusion that women feel anxious and have concerns about a ruptured silicone gel implant. Nevertheless, for replacement, 75.6 percent of women would choose a silicone gel implant, although 10.4 percent would choose a saline-filled implant and 13.9 percent would not replace the implant.

### Rupture of 40-year-old silicone gel breast implants: a case report [^c4f34f79]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, while silicone breast augmentation is one of the most popular aesthetic surgical procedures globally, they are not guaranteed to last a lifetime. Implant quality has improved significantly owing to advances in manufacturing, thereby reducing the risk of capsule formation and implant rupture. The rupture of silicone implants is often insidious, but it can lead to problems at any time. Therefore, it is important to educate patients on the need for close monitoring of their implants after augmentation through MRI or an ultrasound scan to facilitate early detection of any changes before a rupture occurs. Early detection of the implant rupture, in turn, will facilitate early and effective management.

### Evaluating breast implant screening guidelines in breast cancer reconstruction [^b30cfcf8]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration updated its surveillance recommendations for breast implant rupture to ultrasound screening or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 5–6 years following silicone implant placement, with repeat screening every 2–3 years thereafter. This study evaluates the risk of implant rupture and assesses the utility of routine surveillance MRIs in diagnosing implant rupture.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of patients with implant-based reconstruction for breast cancer with a single surgeon between 2012 and 2017. Inclusion criteria included a 5-year minimum follow-up period. Analysis was performed to elucidate rupture rate and associated factors.

Results

A total of 376 patients underwent reconstruction with saline (13%) and silicone implants (87%). Seventy-five (20%) underwent routine MRI screening within 5–6 years of surgery. Implant rupture occurred in 26 patients (7%). Average time from implant placement to rupture was 5.9 ± 4.0 years. Fifty-nine percent of silicone implant ruptures were diagnosed by MRI screening. Thirty-eight percent of silicone implant ruptures presented without clinical symptoms and were identified on routine MRI screening. All saline implant ruptures presented with clinical symptoms. On imaging, ruptures were classified as intracapsular (81%) or extracapsular (12%). Seventy-three percent of ruptures were confirmed intraoperatively during implant replacement. Median time for rupture diagnosis to implant removal/replacement was 3 months (range, 0.5–21 months).

Conclusions

MRI screening for silicone implant rupture in implant-based breast reconstruction had a 59% detection rate, with relatively low patient adherence (20% within 5–6 years after surgery), highlighting the challenges of screening. Patients should be counseled on the risk of implant rupture and the likelihood of needing replacement during their lifetime.

### Economic analysis of screening strategies for rupture of silicone gel breast implants [^54625ba5]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended screening of all women with silicone gel breast implants with magnetic resonance imaging 3 years after implantation and every 2 years thereafter to assess their integrity. The cost for these serial examinations over the lifetime of the breast implants is an added burden to insurance payers and to women. The authors performed an economic analysis to determine optimal screening strategies by considering the diagnostic accuracy of the screening tests, costs of the tests, and subsequent implant removal.

Methods

The authors determined aggregate/pooled values for sensitivity and specificity of the screening tests of ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging in detecting silicone breast implant ruptures from the data obtained from published literature. They compiled costs, based on Medicare reimbursements for 2011, for the following elements: imaging modalities, anesthesia, and three surgical treatment options for detected ruptures. A decision tree was used to compare three alternate screening strategies of ultrasound only, magnetic resonance imaging only, and ultrasound followed by magnetic resonance in asymptomatic and symptomatic women.

Results

The cost per rupture of screening and management of rupture with ultrasound in asymptomatic women was $1090; in symptomatic women, it was $1622. A similar cost for magnetic resonance imaging in asymptomatic women was $2067; in symptomatic women it was $2143. A similar cost for ultrasound followed by imaging in asymptomatic women was $637; in symptomatic women, it was $2908.

Conclusion

Screening with ultrasound followed by magnetic resonance imaging was optimal for asymptomatic women, and screening with ultrasound was optimal for symptomatic women.

### Reasons for silicone breast implant removal after long-term implantation in Chinese patients without complications: a questionnaire-based study [^48dc0155]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There are few studies of Chinese patients who request silicone breast implant removal after at least 10 years of implantation without any complications. This study aimed to study the characteristics of these patients, explore their reasons for breast implant removal and associate factors that affect their choice, so as to provide valuable information on clinical decision making.

Methods

A total of 55 eligible female patients (110 breasts) were enrolled from 2016 to 2022. A preoperative questionnaire survey before removal surgery and a telephone follow-up 1 year after removal surgery were conducted to collect data.

Results

The mean age of the patients was 40.6 ± 8.8 years with the average time from breast augmentation to implant removal or replacement ranged from 10 to 15 years. Concerns about the aging of silicone gel-filled breast implant and the adverse effects of its long-term placement on body health were the top two reasons for breast implant removal. 63% of patients refused implant replacement, who were nearly 10 years older than those accepted implant replacement (p < 0.05). Older age at implant removal (OR = 0.67; 95%CI: 0.44–0.89) and a history of basic diseases (OR = 0.02; 95%CI: 0.00–0.39) were statistically associated with lower rate of implant replacement.

Conclusions

Concerns about the aging of silicone gel-filled breast implant were the main reason for uncomplicated patients to remove their breast implants. A comprehensive analysis based on patient's subjective choice and physical condition was suggested when an uncomplicated patient asks for implant removal.

### Study Re-operation and self-report silicone gel breast implant rupture… [^2f410ddb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

FDA has recently completed a study on how often women who had breast implants had to go back to their surgeons for additional surgery on their breast. The study was presented at the Sixth World Biomaterials Congress on May 18, 2000. The study, performed in Birmingham, Alabama, involved women who had their first breast implant before
1988. The majority of women in this study had silicone gel-filled breast implants. Women responded to a telephone questionnaire in which they described past surgeries and whether or not their implants were found to be ruptured after the surgeries. Women also responded to questions about the reason they had the surgery.
- One third of the 907 women in the study
- 303 women — reported that they had had at least one surgery in which their implant was removed or replaced.
- The most common reason for surgery was for problems with the implant that affected the breast. These include:

- suspected implant rupture.
- pain,
- capsular contracture,
- displaced implant,
- seroma,
- hematoma,
- infection,
- extrusion, and
- other reasons.
- The second most common reason for surgery to remove the breast implant was because of concern over the safety of silicone.
- Other reasons for surgery were disease or symptoms which women or their physicians thought were related to the implant, or because of planned or staged surgeries.
- 73 of the 303 women reported that they went to surgery because of a suspected breast implant rupture. 70% of these women suspected that their implants were ruptured because of breast pain, chest pain or other upper body pain, and 58% of these women reported suspecting implant rupture because of changes in the shape of their breasts.

### Assessment of risk factors for rupture in breast reconstruction patients with macrotextured breast implants [^f18c6984]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Data were retrieved from industry-funded core studies. "–" is used when data in not available. The terms "Anatomical" and "Shaped" are used interchangeably throughout the table

BI rupture rate is defined as the ratio between ruptured implants (numerator) over the total number of implanted individuals (denominator). Obtaining a realistic account of rupture rate that is not limited by industry-sponsored studies is particularly challenging for three reasons. Firstly, data provided by manufacturers might overestimate implant longevity due to the nature of laboratory stress tests performed on BIs. These stress tests are limited in their ability to reproduce in-vivo conditions of implant indwelling, meaning that they are not necessarily predictive of device failure. Secondly, the number of women with BI in each country (i.e. the denominator) is not known, since National Implant Registries are either inexistent, not operational or not currently efficient. Thirdly, most BI ruptures are silent and clinically undetectable, which makes the numerator difficult to assess. In fact, some ruptures may come across as incidental findings from revisional surgeries performed for other reasons or diagnostic images requested for other health concerns. It is worth nothing that 25.8% of all ruptures were extracapsular. Extracapsular rupture can sometimes represent the progression of an intracapsular one, with additional silicone seepage occurring over time. We speculate that BI ruptures likely occurred earlier than when radiologically detected.

### The ruptured PIP breast implant [^d3e6baa1]. Clinical Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Public concern erupted about the safety of Poly Implant Prothèse (PIP) breast implants when it was revealed in 2011 that they contained an inferior, unlicensed industrial-grade silicone associated with a high rate of rupture. There followed national guidance for UK clinicians, which led to a considerable increase in referrals of asymptomatic women for breast implant assessment. In this review we discuss possible approaches to screening the PIP cohort and the salient characteristics of a ruptured implant.

### One-stage immediate breast reconstruction with implants: a new option for immediate reconstruction [^6a1333e8]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The current standard of care for breast implant reconstruction after mastectomy is 2-stage reconstruction with placement of tissue expanders followed by implants. The immediate use of implants at the time of mastectomy, which eliminates the need for a second operative procedure, has been sparsely reported and is not yet accepted as the standard of care. This study describes a 1-stage immediate implant reconstruction technique and evaluates its risks.

Methods

Between 2005 and 2010, immediate implant reconstruction was performed in 43 sequential patients on a total of 78 breasts. Permanent silicone implants were placed at the time of mastectomy with the assistance of acellular dermal matrix (ADM). Follow-up was for an average of 575 days. Implant sizes varied widely from 175 to 800 mL. In order to create the correct breast shape and implant placement, specific techniques of acellular dermal matrix placement in the reconstruction were critically important. Aesthetic evaluation of the patients was performed, evaluating pre- and postoperative photos by 20 evaluators. Pictures were rated according to a 4-point Harris breast scale. A 2-sided paired t test was then used to compare the rating scores.

Results

Complication rates were as follows: seroma occurred in 6.4% of breasts; infection resolving with antibiotics occurred in 2.6%; infection requiring implant removal occurred in 3.8%; and hematoma occurred in 1.3%. Neither preoperative breast size nor implant size correlated to an increased risk of complications (P > 0.05). Complication rate increased with age (P = 0.02). The average score for the preoperative images was 2.1, whereas the postoperative average was 2.4. This represented a statistically significant improvement above the baseline (preoperative) breasts with a P < 0.001, according to a 2-sided paired t test.

Conclusions

With complication rates similar to previously reported tissue expander reconstructions, immediate implant reconstruction is a viable alternative to 2-stage expander reconstruction, presenting many advantages over expander reconstruction while offering the same risk profile and eliminating the additional risks, costs, and discomfort of a second procedure. Additionally, aesthetic results were highly satisfactory according to patients themselves and based on evaluation by independent observers.

### Ideal implant structured breast implants: core study results through 10 years [^4c7d0f64]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The silicone gel-filled implant has a natural, tissue-like feel because of the viscosity of the silicone gel, which has been increased by more cross-linking in successive generations of implants over the years and that also makes the silicone gel more cohesive. This cross-linked silicone gel supports the shell to minimize upper pole collapse when upright (Fig. 1). Even with more cohesive silicone gel, a major disadvantage and a concern of women is that ruptures are silent(ie, not clinically detectable) and occur at a relatively high rate (8.7% to 24.2% in 10-year Core studies –). The FDA's current recommendation is for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound scan to detect silent rupture at 5 to 6 years after implantation, then every 2 to 3 years thereafter. Also, the FDA recommends removal of a ruptured implant, which may entail time-consuming procedures such as capsulectomy for complete removal of the silicone gel. In a recent study of 584 women with current versions of silicone gel implants who had high-resolution ultrasound scans, 10.6% had a silent rupture, with ranges of 3.4% to 5.3% if implanted at least 3 but less than 6 years, to 25% to 50% if implanted at least 14 but less than 16 years. Surveys taken before and after the scans revealed women's desire to know whether their implants were ruptured (99.5%) and for removal if found to be ruptured (95.2%). On learning that an implant was ruptured, women reported a variety of concerns about the following: silicone gel in contact with their tissues (76.9%), extent of revision surgery (72.9%), how long the implant had been ruptured (68.8%), and that the rupture was silent (63.4%). Another indication of women's concern about silent rupture is that 95.5% would get ultrasound scans every 3 months to every 2 years, more frequently than the current FDA recommendation of every 2 to 3 years after an initial scan at 5 to 6 years.

### Incidence of silicone breast implant rupture… [^16cce11c]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

We found 33 definite ruptures and 23 possible ruptures during the 2-year period. The overall rupture incidence rate for definite ruptures was 5. 3 ruptures/100 implants per year. The rupture rate increased significantly with increasing implant age. Double-lumen implants were associated with substantially lower rupture risk than single-lumen implants. For modern implants intact 3 years after implantation, we estimated rupture-free survival of 98% at 5 years and 83% to 85% at 10 years. All women who underwent the first MRI were considered eligible for the second MRI examination, regardless of the diagnosis at the first MRI, with the exception of 44 women whose implants had been removed or exchanged as a consequence of findings at the first MRI or on the basis of clinical indication before the second MRI.

Thus, these 44 women did not undergo the second MRI, with the exception of 1 woman who was operated on unilaterally and whose contralateral breast was eligible for the second MRI. Three women had emigrated and could not be reached, and 19 declined to participate. This left 206 women with cosmetic silicone breast implants for the second MRI, which was carried out during 2001. In one woman who underwent surgery before the second MRI, an implant was described as intact at the operation but had been diagnosed as ruptured at the first MRI. This implant was reclassified as intact at baseline. A total of 317 implants, intact at baseline, in 186 women thus contributed to the rupture incidence analyses. For 280 implants the status of the implant was determined by the second MRI examination, and for 37 implants the status was determined at surgery.

The risk of rupture, expressed as the proportion of ruptured implants, and the crude rupture incidence rates increased with implant age regardless of the definition used. The implant age–adjusted rupture rates were low and of similar magnitude for first- and third-generation implants, regardless of definition, whereas second-generation implants had a significantly higher rate if definite and possible ruptures were combined, but not if only definite ruptures were considered. The large disparity in the results was due to the substantial number of possible ruptures among second-generation implants. A similar pattern was apparent if the shell characteristics definition for implant generation was applied.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® breast implant evaluation: 2023 update [^1d699b25]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

This document discusses the appropriate initial imaging in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with breast implants. For asymptomatic patients with saline implants, no imaging is recommended. If concern for rupture exists, ultrasound is usually appropriate though saline rupture is often clinically evident. The FDA recently recommended patients have an initial ultrasound or MRI examination 5 to 6 years after initial silicone implant surgery and then every 2 to 3 years thereafter. In a patient with unexplained axillary adenopathy with current or prior silicone breast implants, ultrasound and/or mammography are usually appropriate, depending on age. In a patient with concern for silicone implant rupture, ultrasound or MRI without contrast is usually appropriate. In the setting of a patient with breast implants and possible implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ultrasound is usually appropriate as the initial imaging. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Long-term outcomes of 1989 immediate implant-based breast reconstructions: an analysis of risk factors for failure and revision surgery [^5a3fa735]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer treatment guidelines worldwide recommend that breast reconstruction should be offered to all women undergoing mastectomy, allowing shared decision-making. – Immediate rather than delayed breast reconstruction allows these women to better cope with their mastectomy with improvement of quality of life in terms of self-image, self-esteem, and sexuality. – Combined with nipple- or skin-sparing mastectomy, immediate reconstruction allows the preservation of native mammary skin envelope and the inframammary fold.

Immediate reconstruction can be performed using an implant or autologous tissue. Implant-based breast reconstruction offers technical and logistic advantages as compared to autologous reconstruction. An immediate implant-based breast reconstruction (IBR) is completed either with the direct-to-implant (DTI) approach or with the temporary use of a tissue expander first. In the DTI approach, a permanent prosthesis is inserted immediately, with the advantage to achieve a final result in 1 procedure. Using a tissue expander for a 2-staged approach gives the opportunity for additional adjustments during the second procedure.

Either method may require revision surgery and both are associated with complications. Short-term complications include infection, skin necrosis, hematoma, and implant loss –; pain, distortion, capsular contracture, implant rupture, or unfavorable cosmetic outcomes are reported long-term unfavorable outcomes.– Various risk factors for unfavorable outcomes associated with IBR have been reported,– but data on long-term outcomes regarding revision surgery, reconstruction failure, and oncologic follow-up are scarce.

The main objectives of this study were to assess the long-term outcomes of IBR in patients undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer or prophylactic surgery and to assess risk factors for reconstruction failure or revision surgery.

### The occurrence of health symptoms in general practice before and after the explantation of cosmetic breast implants [^526c2a7d]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Although explantation reduced the likelihood of having multiple symptoms and consultations, patients who underwent explantation remained more likely to experience 2 or more distinct symptoms and have 3 or more consultations compared with women without breast implants. This is consistent with a previous study, which found that patients who underwent explantation still reported more symptoms than those who had mastopexy without previous implants, despite significant symptom improvement after explantation. These findings suggest that although explantation improves symptoms, some issues may persist. However, it is important to note that not all patients in our study underwent explantation specifically for BII, although BII may have been underreported in DBIR. Consequently, drawing definitive conclusions about the beneficial effects of explantation on BII remains challenging.

Patients who opted for replacement surgery rather than explantation also showed a reduced likelihood of having symptoms and consultations, although the improvement appeared to be less pronounced compared with patients who underwent explantation. in a recent study, the authors similarly found that, although both replacement and explantation led to symptom improvement, explantation resulted in more substantial improvements. In another study, the researchers observed improvement in headaches following replacement surgery, whereas explantation patients reported improvements in a wider range of symptoms from 2 to 22 distinct symptoms.

The observed reduction in BII-related symptoms following replacement surgery is striking, especially because replacement in this study was typically performed to address local complications or dissatisfaction with implant size, rather than to treat BII. It is possible that the symptom improvement partly reflects a placebo effect, driven by positive treatment expectations. Nearly 30% of replacements were because of ruptured implants, and patients may anticipate symptom relief following the removal of a ruptured implant. Although evidence increasingly suggests that silicone leakage is unlikely to be the cause of symptoms, its portrayal in the media as a likely contributor may shape these expectations. Similarly, in the case of explantation, symptom relief may also result partially or entirely from a placebo effect, influenced by (social) media reports that highlight the health benefits of implant removal. This is especially evident as most explantation procedures occurred between 2019 and 2021, coinciding with heightened media attention on BII in the Netherlands. This media focus may have influenced the rise in explantations and reinforced placebo effects.

### Silent rupture of silicone gel breast implants: high-resolution ultrasound scans and surveys of 584 women [^49b42d5d]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Women's concerns and feelings about silent rupture of their silicone gel implants have not been reported previously. Of the 584 women with silicone gel implants surveyed before their high-resolution ultrasound scan (Table 4), 70.9 percent had never been concerned that they may have a ruptured implant, 76.2 percent did not know the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends regular magnetic resonance imaging scans of silicone gel implants to screen for silent rupture, and 95.4 percent never had a magnetic resonance imaging scan of their implants. These responses are surprising in view of all the information provided for informed consent and the recent media attention directed at breast implant safety issues. Perhaps these women have been denying the possibility of having a ruptured implant, because when given the opportunity, 99.5 percent of women would like to know whether they have a ruptured implant and 95.2 percent would want a ruptured implant removed, even if asymptomatic. On learning that an implant has ruptured, most women reported that they would have a number of concerns: about silicone in contact with their tissues (76.9 percent), the expense or extent of revision surgery (72.9 percent), how long the implant had been ruptured (68.8 percent), and that the rupture was silent (63.4 percent). Only 1.7 percent of women responded that nothing would concern them.

### Safety and efficacy of the sientra silicone gel round and shaped breast implants: 6-year results of the U.S. postapproval study [^af10beca]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this analysis of the 10-year postapproval study, the clinical performance of the Sientra silicone breast implants was studied through 6 years of follow-up in over 5000 patients who had augmentation, reconstruction, or revision surgery under general conditions of use in the postmarket environment. The 6-year safety and efficacy results were consistent with the core study, (Table 8) and provide additional evidence from a large data set supporting the comprehensive safety and effectiveness profile of the Sientra smooth round and textured round and shaped breast implants.

Table 8.
Comparison of Primary Local Complications between Postapproval Study and Core Study a (Patient-Based Analysis)

Overall, the data demonstrate a low risk of adverse events, including rupture, capsular contracture, and reoperation, and high rates of patient satisfaction with real-world use of the Sientra breast implants. For the primary study endpoints, Kaplan-Meier risk rates varied by cohort, but were generally low. The risk of reoperation for all cohorts combined was 11.6%, with the highest risk reported in the reconstruction cohorts, in which approximately one-third of patients had reoperation, primarily for aesthetic reasons or capsular contracture. Of note, for total reoperations, there was a low Kaplan-Meier risk of implant removal without replacement (ranging from 1.5% in primary augmentation to 7.9% in revision-reconstruction), suggesting that patients were largely happy with their implants.

### Imaging of the patient with silicone gel breast implants [^a033d559]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

There are two reasons for radiologic evaluation of the augmented breast. Because women with implants are at the same risk for breast cancer as other women, imaging is performed to screen for cancer or to work up clinical abnormalities. Additionally, imaging allows assessment of implant integrity. The various methods for imaging implants and breast tissue in the augmented patient are discussed. Imaging findings suggestive of silicone gel implant rupture are presented.

### Diagnostic and screening magnetic resonance imaging of the breast [^92f50b51]. ASBrS (2018). Medium credibility.

Breast MRI for suspected implant rupture — For evaluation of suspected breast implant rupture, especially in patients with silicone implants, evaluation is indicated when MRI findings will aid the decision-making for implant removal or aid the diagnostic evaluation of indeterminate clinical or conventional imaging findings in patients with implants. The MRI protocol for detection of silicone leak is different from the protocol for detection of breast cancer, so it is important to clearly define the purpose of the breast MRI if the concern is a silicone leak.

### Silent rupture of silicone gel breast implants: high-resolution ultrasound scans and surveys of 584 women [^eb1689fd]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

A suspected rupture of a silicone gel implant affected women's attitudes about the implant types they would consider if getting implants for the first time today. Those who had a suspected rupture were less likely to consider a silicone gel implant today (73.0 percent) and more likely to consider no implant (17.4 percent) than those women who did not have a suspected rupture (80.8 percent and 9.4 percent, respectively). Women who had a suspected rupture and those who did not have a suspected rupture were about equally likely to consider a saline-filled implant type if getting implants for the first time today (33.9 percent and 35.3 percent, respectively).

### "Out points" criteria for breast implant removal without replacement and criteria to minimize reoperations following breast augmentation [^ae24885d]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Breast augmentation is a totally elective, medically unnecessary procedure, and surgeons and patients must prioritize minimizing tradeoffs, costs, and risks at the primary operation and at reoperations. At the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's advisory panel hearings in October of 2003 to consider approval of conventional silicone gel implants, data documented an overall reoperation rate of 20 percent at just 3 years after primary breast augmentation. Subsequently, the premarket approval was not granted. Similarly high reoperation rates have been reported in previous saline and silicone gel premarket approval studies over the past two decades, demonstrating that high reoperation rates are not device dependent and suggesting a need to reexamine surgical management criteria. Bilateral implant removal without replacement limits additional reoperations in a wide range of clinical situations. Surgeons and patients often prefer other options to avoid removal without replacement, but other options carry a higher tradeoffs, costs, and risks to the patient. If minimizing tradeoffs, costs, and risks of reoperations is a priority, surgeons must define and patients must understand and accept "out points", that is, specific criteria for bilateral implant removal without replacement. Defining out points is challenging. Enforcing them when difficult clinical situations occur is even more challenging. This article presents out points that have been incorporated into staged, repetitive informed consent documents and used in the author's practice for more than 10 years. In peer-reviewed and published reports of more than 1600 patients, these out points criteria, in conjunction with the TEPID system (tissue characteristics of the envelope, parenchyma, and implant and the dimensions and fill distribution dynamics of the implant) of implant and pocket selection based on individual patient quantifiable tissue criteria and surgical techniques that minimize tissue trauma and bleeding, resulted in an overall reoperation rate of 3 percent in 1662 reported cases with up to 7 years of follow-up, compared with the 20 percent reoperation rate at 3 years in the most recent Food and Drug Administration study.

### Chronic pulmonary silicone embolism after breast implant rupture: an underdiagnosed cause of acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia? [^560b996c]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Background

Silicone breast implants are widely used for both cosmetic enhancement and reconstructive surgery, with millions of procedures performed globally each year. Despite their popularity, concerns regarding the long-term safety of silicone implants have emerged, including complications such as chronic pulmonary silicone embolism (CPSE). This condition, while rare, can develop years after implant rupture and removal, leading to significant respiratory issues that are often misdiagnosed.

CPSE presents a unique challenge for physicians, as its symptoms — including dyspnoea, cough and fever — are non-specific and may mimic other pulmonary diseases. The diagnosis is complicated further by the delayed onset of symptoms, often occurring years after the initial surgical procedure. This case underscores the importance of recognising the potential for silicone-related lung complications in patients with a history of breast implants, especially when conventional treatments fail.

The key message of this manuscript is the need for heightened awareness among clinicians regarding CPSE as a potential cause of respiratory disease in patients with a history of breast implants. Early consideration of this diagnosis may facilitate timely management and improve patient outcomes.

### PIP silicone breast implants: rupture rates based on the explantation of 676 implants in a single surgeon series [^3a55dadc]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

To determine the true rupture rates of PIP implants from a large single surgeon cohort and to assess whether rupture rates varied depending on time of implant insertion. In addition, the efficacy of ultra sound scanning (USS) in determining rupture is examined.

Design

Predominantly prospectively based analysis of patient records, investigations and surgical findings.

Participants

338 patients (676 implants) were included in the study and they all had removal of their implants. The senior author operated on all patients at some stage of their treatment. 160 patients were imaged pre-operatively with USS. Patients had implants inserted between 1999 and 2007 for cosmetic breast augmentation.

Results

A total of 144 ruptured implants were removed from 119 patients, giving a rupture rate of 35.2% per patient and 21.3% per implant over a mean implantation period of 7.8 years. A statistical difference (P < 0.001) in rupture rates between implants inserted prior to 2003 and those inserted from 2003 was demonstrated, with higher failure rates in the latter group. There was a significant difference in rupture rates depending on pocket placement of the implants. The sensitivity and specificity of USS at detecting rupture was 90.6% and 98.3% respectively. A proportion of patients (29.4%) demonstrated loco-regional spread of silicone to the axilla on scanning.

Conclusions

Our paper has confirmed high rates of PIP implant failure in the largest published series to date. The significant difference in rupture rates between implants inserted prior to 2003 and those after this time supports the view that industrial silicone was used in the devices after 2003. Implants are more likely to rupture if inserted in the sub muscular plane compared to the sub glandular plane. USS is highly effective at detecting rupture in PIP implants and loco-regional spread is high compared to other devices. We believe this paper provides hard data enabling more informed decision making for patients, clinicians and providers in what remains an active issue affecting thousands of women.

### Silent rupture of silicone gel breast implants: high-resolution ultrasound scans and surveys of 584 women [^d27cd731]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

If a woman had a scan interpreted by the plastic surgeon reviewer as ruptured, her office medical records were reviewed to learn whether she had chosen to undergo surgery and to correlate the surgical findings with the high-resolution ultrasound scan final interpretation. The investigators began obtaining scans in April of 2019, then slowly ramped up so that most scans were obtained in late 2019 through March of 2020; the medical records were reviewed and surgical results were recorded in early September of 2020. In the time interval following their scans, women may have delayed their decision to have explantation surgery waiting for final interpretation of their scans by the plastic surgeon reviewer, and then may have delayed further because of health and financial concerns related to the coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic.

To document women's concerns and feelings about silent rupture of silicone gel implants, in-person surveys were administered by the office staff: one before the high-resolution ultrasound scan and another immediately after the scan that was specific to the investigator's initial interpretation of the scan, either not ruptured or a suspected rupture.

All data were collected on standardized case report forms in paper and/or electronic format. The study was approved by a central investigational review board (Salus IRB, Austin, Texas), because all investigators conducted study procedures in their private practice offices.

Subjects

Women aged 18 years or older were eligible to enroll. Informed consent was obtained in writing. Inclusion criteria were that they had one or two silicone gel breast implants implanted between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2015, and had access to their breast surgery record or device card to verify the manufacturer, type of surface, shape, and implant date. Women with a known ruptured implant were excluded. The study population consisted of women within the practice at the study sites who were invited to participate during an already-scheduled office visit and/or through practice communications, such as e-mails and social media.

Between April of 2019 and March of 2020, a total of 584 women were enrolled at nine study sites, with a range of 11 to 199 at each site (mean, 65). Bilateral implants were present in 569 women and only one implant was present in 15 women; thus, a total of 1153 implants were scanned. Both implants were from the same manufacturer in all but two women. These 1153 implants had the characteristics shown in Table 2.

### Unnecessary explantation of IDEAL IMPLANT structured saline breast implants prompted byRadiologic misdiagnosis of rupture [^8c25ada0]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The unique dual-lumen and baffle design of the IDEAL IMPLANT Structured Saline breast implant gives it specific advantages over both silicone gel-filled and the original saline-filled implants. This internal baffle structure also gives it an appearance on various radiologic imaging studies that may be misinterpreted as a rupture because of similarities to the well-known radiologic appearance of a ruptured silicone gel implant. Patients may present with various misinterpreted imaging studies, highlighting the need for plastic surgeons and radiologists to be familiar with the normal appearance of the intact IDEAL IMPLANT and be able to distinguish it from a ruptured IDEAL IMPLANT. The radiology findings must be correlated with the clinical findings, or an intact IDEAL IMPLANT misdiagnosed as ruptured, may cause unnecessary patient worry, and may prompt unnecessary surgery for removal or replacement.

### Decision and management algorithms to address patient and food and drug administration concerns regarding breast augmentation and implants [^1fff04a3]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

During the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's advisory panel hearings to evaluate the premarket approval for conventional silicone gel implants on October 14 and 15, 2003, panel members and patient advocate representatives focused on four specific areas of concern: reoperation rates in primary breast augmentation; levels, depth, and methods of patient education and informed consent; modes, frequency, and management of silicone gel implant device failures, including management of "silent" ruptures; and methods of monitoring and managing symptoms or symptom complexes that may or may not be associated with connective tissue disease or other undefined symptom complexes. These concerns, with a reported 20 percent reoperation rate for primary augmentation within just 3 years, and a lack of concise, definitive management protocols addressing these areas of concern may have contributed to the Food and Drug Administration's rejection of the premarket approval, despite the panel's recommendation for approval. This article presents decision and management algorithms that have been used successfully for 7 years in a busy breast augmentation practice (Tebbetts and Tebbetts). The algorithms have been further expanded and refined by a group of surgeons with diverse experiences and expertise to address the following clinical situations that coincide with concerns expressed by patients and the Food and Drug Administration: implant size exchange, grade III to IV capsular contracture, infection, stretch deformities (implant bottoming or displacement), silent rupture of gel implants, and undefined symptom complexes (connective tissue disease or other). In one practice (Tebbetts and Tebbetts) that uses the TEPID system (tissue characteristics of the envelope, parenchyma, and implant and the dimensions and fill distribution dynamics of the implant), implant selection is based on quantified patient tissue characteristics, pocket selection is based on quantified soft-tissue coverage, and anatomic saline implants have fill volumes that are designed to minimize shell collapse and fold fatigue; in this practice, the algorithms contributed to a 3 percent overall reoperation rate in 1662 reported cases with up to 7 years of follow-up, compared with a 20 percent reoperation rate at 3 years in the 2003 premarket approval study.

### The safety of silicone gel-filled breast implants: a review of the epidemiologic evidence [^9ee18781]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Few implantable medical devices have been studied for their safety more extensively than silicone gel-filled breast implants. We summarize the epidemiologic evidence on the safety of breast implants, most of which is drawn from large cohort studies with long-term follow-up. The topics addressed in this report include cancer, breast cancer detection, connective tissue disease, suicide, offspring effects, neurologic disease, implant rupture, and local perioperative complications and additional surgery. We conclude that the weight of the epidemiologic evidence does not support a causal association between breast implants and breast or any other type of cancer, definite or atypical connective tissue disease, adverse offspring effects, or neurologic disease. Women with breast implants do not present with more advanced stages of breast cancer or suffer impaired survival after breast cancer diagnosis. The only study to examine an actual incidence rate of breast implant rupture reported rupture-free survival of 98% at 5 years and 83%-85% at 10 years for newer "third-generation" implants. Future studies are needed to determine whether the consistently observed excess of suicide among women with implants reflects underlying psychiatric illness prior to breast augmentation surgery or other factors.

### Rupture of 40-year-old silicone gel breast implants: a case report [^bc8ad6ee]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Implant rupture is one of the complications of breast augmentation surgery. The rupture of silicone implants is often insidious, potentially causing problems at any time. This is a case report of the rupture of 145-cc breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning Corporation and their removal at 40 years after augmentation.

Case Presentation

A 70-year-old female patient was admitted for the removal of a lump in the upper and inner quadrants of the right breast. After a detailed examination, a rupture of the bilateral breast implants was diagnosed. Explantation without replacement was performed; the entire procedure proceeded smoothly. Immunohistochemical staining revealed siliconoma with lymphoid hyperplasia and calcification in the bilateral breasts with no signs of malignancy.

Conclusions

Silicone breast augmentation is one of the most popular aesthetic surgical procedures worldwide. Therefore, it is important to educate patients on the need for close monitoring of their implants after augmentation through magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound to facilitate early detection of any changes before a rupture occurs. Early detection of the implant rupture, in turn, will facilitate early and effective management.

### Diagnostic and screening magnetic resonance imaging of the breast [^711a16f6]. ASBrS (2018). Medium credibility.

Breast implants — MRI screening guidance — states that the American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS) does not recommend routine MRI screening in asymptomatic patients with silicone or saline implants, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2006) recommended serial MRI screening to detect rupture; because a systematic review and meta-analysis identified methodologic biases resulting in overestimation of MRI benefit, the FDA recommendations should be interpreted with caution regarding routine screening of patients with silicone implants.

### Evaluation of major complications following ruptured implant removal: a national surgery quality improvement program database analysis [^32c935f8]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

After the removal of ruptured breast implants, patients may elect to replace or not replace ruptured implants. They also may elect to undergo mastopexy alone without replacement of breast implants to maintain a more aesthetic shape of the breast after ruptured implant removal.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to cultivate an understanding of demographic differences in patient populations who opted for various surgical options at the time of ruptured implant removal. We hypothesized that procedures performed at the time of ruptured breast implant removal had a favorable complication profile.

Methods

Utilizing the American College of Surgeons' National Surgery Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database (2011–2022), surgeries performed at the same time of ruptured breast implant removal (CPT 19330) were analyzed. To capture cosmetic patients, any patient with an ICD or CPT code related to breast cancer was excluded. Patients with implant replacement were identified with appropriate CPT codes. For those who did not undergo implant replacement, a subgroup was created for those who underwent mastopexy. Demographics and complication rates between groups were compared with Welch's t tests or chi-square tests.

Results

The majority (54.9%; 1662/3028) of patients elected to have new implants placed. Of those who did not undergo implant replacement, 12.2% (167/1366) had a mastopexy. Regardless of whether the patient chose to replace implants or undergo mastopexy, there were low complication rates, including infection (0.9%-2.4%), abscess (0.0%-1.4%), dehiscence (0.3%-0.5%), and bleeding (0.0%-0.6%). Rates of reoperation (1.2%-1.8%) and readmission (0.0%-1.8%) also were low.

Conclusions

Removal of ruptured implants is a safe procedure, with low levels of complication, regardless of whether the patient chooses to replace or not to replace ruptured implants.

### Analyzing regional differences over a 15-year trend of one-stage versus two-stage breast reconstruction in 941, 191 postmastectomy patients [^ec0fac8d]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Implant-based reconstruction is the predominant form of breast reconstruction, with the two-stage tissue expander/implant approach being the most popular. Recently, the direct-to-implant, one-stage breast reconstruction procedure has gained momentum. In this study, national and regional trends across the United States for the two different types of implant-based reconstructions were evaluated.

Methods

The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database was used to extrapolate data on type of mastectomy, implant-based reconstructive technique (one-stage or two-stage), and sociodemographic and hospital variables. Differences were assessed using the chi-square test, impact of variables on reconstructive method was analyzed using logistic regression, and trends were analyzed using the Cochrane-Armitage test.

Results

Between 1998 and 2012, a total of 1,444,587 patients treated for breast cancer or at increased risk of breast cancer met the defined selection criteria. Of these, 194,377 patients underwent implant-based breast reconstruction (13.6 percent one-stage and 86.4 percent two-stage). In both, there was a significant increase in procedures performed over time (p < 0.001). The highest increase in both was seen in the Northeast region of the United States, and the lowest increase was seen in the South. When stratified into regions, analysis showed differences in socioeconomic and hospital characteristics within the different regions.

Conclusions

There is an observed increase in the number of one-stage and two-stage breast reconstructions being performed. Sociodemographic and hospital factors of influence vary in the different regions of the United States. This study provides important information for clinicians and policy makers who seek to ensure equitable and appropriate access for patient to the different types of implant-based procedures.

### Short-term cost-effectiveness of one-stage implant-based breast reconstruction with an acellular dermal matrix versus two-stage expander-implant reconstruction from a multicentre randomized clinical trial [^805d2fe7]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Of 142 women enrolled and randomized, 59 who had one‐stage IBBR with ADM and 62 who underwent two‐stage IBBR were included in the analysis (Fig. 1). Comprehensive details of patient demographics were published previously 21. Mean follow‐up after the first operation was 37 months for one‐stage IBBR with ADM and 35 months for two‐stage IBBR. Significantly more complications occurred in the one‐stage group (40 versus 14 per cent of reconstructions), which resulted in higher reoperation (32 versus 13 per cent) and implant removal (26 versus 4 per cent) rates (Table 2) 21.

Figure 1
Flow diagram for the trial

Table 2
Surgical complications, reoperations and removal of implant

Primary breast reconstruction procedure

The primary surgery took significantly longer for one‐stage IBBR with ADM than two‐stage reconstruction, for both unilateral (mean(s.d.) 172(55) versus 122(35) min respectively; P < 0.001) and bilateral (243(60) versus 205(58) min; P = 0.017) reconstructions (Table 3). Duration of hospital stay after the primary operation did not differ significantly between the two groups. Combining the two operations in the two‐stage group, the total operating time for bilateral two‐stage reconstructions was longer than that for bilateral one‐stage reconstruction (289(71) versus 243(60) min; P = 0.013). The total median hospital stay was longer for unilateral and bilateral two‐stage reconstructions than for one‐stage reconstructions (unilateral: median 5 (range 3–10) versus 3 (2–8) days respectively, P = 0.002; bilateral: 5 (2–11) versus 4 (2–11) days; P = 0.008).

Table 3
Operation details for both primary breast reconstructive procedures (per patient)

The mean total direct cost for unilateral one‐stage IBBR was comparable to that of unilateral two‐stage reconstruction (€9052 (95 per cent c.i. 8409 to 9815) versus €8940 (8445 to 9537) respectively; P = 0.815). However, for bilateral reconstruction, the cost of one‐stage IBBR was higher than that of two‐stage reconstruction (€14 364 (13 672 to 15 088) versus €12 566 (11 790 to 13 471); P = 0.004), owing to higher implant costs in the one‐stage group.

### Breast augmentation surgery: how Do we Do It? Results of a joint survey from European association of societies of aesthetic plastic surgery [^4a745658]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current perceptions, preferences, and practice of plastic surgeons in Europe regarding breast implant surgery after the controversy on macrotextured implants and BIA-ALCL and the voluntary recall of all biocell implants.

Methods

A survey comprising 15 questions about implant selection and postoperative routines associated with breast augmentation was sent to all society members of the EASAPS.

Results

Out of 1473 correspondents, 416 completed the survey with response rate being 28.2%. Countries with less than ten respondents were not included in the analysis. A total of 359 respondents (24.4%) were included in the analysis. Twenty-one respondents (5.8%) had a clinical experience < 5 years, 43 (12%) had 5–10 years' experience, and 295 (82.2%) had > 10 years' experience. Regarding the type of implant, only 6.1% would use a macrotextured implant. Fourteen per cent of surgeons would recommend to change a biocell implant in any case, even without symptoms or problems (rupture, seroma, and capsular contracture), 99.7% would send the capsule for histopathological study (99.7%), 98.9% would perform bilateral implant replacement in case of a unilateral problem of rupture, contracture, or seroma, and 80.8% of respondents considered capsulectomy as a technique for managing capsular contracture degree III/IV.

Conclusions

The main conclusion is the heterogenicity of answers and practice, due to the lack of guidelines and scientific evidence on breast implants. Although 22 (6.1%) respondents would use a macrotextured implant (either round or anatomic), 71.6% of respondents considered that there is not enough information for removing macrotextured implants from the market and that they should be allowed to be used unrestrictedly or under close surveillance of the regulatory agencies.

### Delayed breast implant reconstruction: a 10-year prospective study [^0340e74d]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Studies of complications following reconstructive surgery with implants among women with breast cancer are needed. As the, to our knowledge, first prospective long-term study we evaluated the occurrence of complications following delayed breast reconstruction separately for one- and two-stage procedures. From the Danish Registry for Plastic Surgery of the Breast, which has prospectively registered data for women undergoing breast implantations since 1999, we identified 559 women without a history of radiation therapy undergoing 592 delayed breast reconstructions following breast cancer during the period 1999 to 2006; 239 one-stage procedures and 353 two-stage procedures. The postoperative course through November 2009 was evaluated by cumulative incidence adjusting for competing risks for the selected outcomes; hematoma, infection, seroma, implant rupture, severe capsular contracture (modified Baker III and IV), extrusion of the implant, asymmetry/displacement of the implant, any complication, and reoperation. These analyses were performed both overall and separately according to type of procedure (one- or two-stage). The overall 10-year risk estimates were 68.1% for any complication, 7.7% for severe capsular contracture, 32.3% for displacement/asymmetry of the implant and 38.6% for reoperation. When comparing one- and two-stage procedures, we observed significantly higher risk estimates for infection, seroma and extrusion of the implant following two-stage procedures, whereas the risk of reoperation was significantly higher following the one-stage procedure. For both procedures, the majority of reoperations were due to asymmetry or displacement of the implant. In conclusion, non-radiated one- and two-stage delayed breast implant reconstructions are associated with substantial risks of complications and reoperation which should be taken into consideration in the planning of breast reconstruction.

### Implications of individual, demographic and economic factors on symmetrization decision making during two-stage implant breast reconstruction [^1b203671]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In order to achieve a symmetrical result during unilateral breast reconstruction, a procedure on the contralateral breast is often necessary, the performance of which ultimately depends on the patient's decision. The aim of this study is to identify the factors that may influence this decision in patients during second-stage breast reconstruction with implants.

Methods

Women with breast cancer diagnosis who underwent unilateral second-stage breast reconstruction with implant placement between 2012 and 2022 in our hospital were included.

Results

Five hundred thirty-three patients underwent unilateral second-stage implant-based breast reconstruction in the study period. Simultaneous symmetrization of the contralateral breast was performed in 406 (76.17%) patients. Age and premium health insurance were associated with patients undergoing contralateral breast symmetrization with statistical significance. In addition, younger patients underwent symmetrization by augmentation mastoplasty with a statistically significant association. On the other hand, within the same group of patients, we found a statistically significant association between body mass index (BMI) and the type of symmetrization performed. Among the patients who underwent contralateral breast symmetrization, the majority (43.52%) answered that the main reason for doing so was that they wanted to "feel more balanced".

Conclusions

The decision to perform contralateral breast symmetrization during second-stage breast reconstruction is associated with demographic and economic factors such as patient age and insurance coverage of surgery costs. In addition, patient age and weight influence the choice of the most appropriate symmetrization procedure.

### Mastectomy with breast reconstruction in previously augmented patients: indications for implant removal [^f423d461]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Surgeons performing breast reconstruction in previously augmented patients can either leave the preexisting implant in place and incorporate the implant into the reconstruction, or remove the implant, usually performing an implant exchange. The focus of this study is to identify indications for implant removal in previously augmented patients undergoing mastectomy with breast reconstruction. We performed a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent breast reconstruction from 1997–2007 at University of Alabama, Birmingham Medical Center. Of these patients, 54 had previous augmentation with silicone or saline implants. Twenty-two of these underwent bilateral breast reconstruction, making a total of 76 reconstructed breasts. Patients were followed for a mean of 2.1 years (range 0.1–5.1 years). The mean body mass index was 23.0 (range 18–30). Implants were explanted in all but one patient. Reasons for implant removal or exchange included subglandular position (n = 39), aged silicone implant (n = 50), rupture or leak (n = 24), implant exposure (n = 1), and infection (n = 1). Some patients had more than one reason for explantation. We recommend removal of preexisting implants for patients who have implants in a subglandular position, ruptures or leaks, site infections, implant exposures, capsular contractures, pain, indolent seromas, aged silicone implants, poor cosmesis, plans for or history of radiotherapy, and close proximity of tumor to implant. We also remove implants to respect patient preferences and to achieve symmetry in our reconstruction. Consequently, we find in our practice that most of previously augmented patients who undergo breast reconstruction will also undergo implant removal.

### Assessment of risk factors for rupture in breast reconstruction patients with macrotextured breast implants [^9877202b]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

The starting population of 763 patients had a mean age of 48.9 years and consisted of 580 primary (76%) and 183 revisional cases (24%). Mean BI indwelling was of 12.2 years (range: 3.2–30.5). One-hundred-fifteen BI rupture patients were identified (15.1%). Mean BI lifespan was of 10.1 years (range: 0.6–29.4). One-hundred-ninety-one (25.0%) patients responded to the questionnaire between June 2021 and January 2022, for a total of 288 breasts. The population included 254 (88.1%) breast reconstructions following mastectomy and 34 (11.9%) non-oncologic cases (including cosmetic augmentations and corrections of congenital breast deformities). Placement was submuscular in 255 (88.5%) and subglandular in 33 cases (11.5%). We report that 250 (86.8%) BIs were manufactured by Allergan (Allergan Inc. Irvine, CA, USA), and that overall 95.1% of all analyzed devices had a macrotextured outer surface. Additionally, 253 (87.8%) implants were shaped, while 35 (12.2%) were round. Patient demographics, surgery and BI characteristics are detailed in Table 3. The study included 93 (32.3%) BI ruptures: 84 had been placed for breast reconstruction following mastectomy, four during cosmetic breast augmentation and five for correction of congenital breast deformities. In 12 patients, rupture of the implant was bilateral, while it was unilateral in 69. Capsular contracture was grade I–II in 235 (81.6%) and grade III-IV in 53 patients (18.4%) (Table 4). Rupture was defined according to preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging findings as intracapsular when the periprosthetic capsule was intact despite a breach of the implant shell, which occurred in 69 instances (74.2%). Extracapsular rupture was defined as the event in which silicone extravasation occurred, which represents 24 cases (25.8%). Location of BI rupture was detected during revisional surgery and accurately described in 73 surgical reports, but was unknown in 20 (21.5%). Rupture was located in one of four quadrants. If two or more quadrants were affected, the implant was divided in an anterior and posterior aspect. If three or more quadrants were affected, the implant was considered completely disrupted. Frequency of BI rupture location is depicted in Figure 1, but was not deemed statistically significant (Figure 1).

### Assessment of silicone particle migration among women undergoing removal or revision of silicone breast implants in the Netherlands [^8f777b7e]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are cohesive gel breast implants associated with silicone bleed?

Findings

In this case series including 389 women with silicone gel breast implants, 384 women (98.8%) showed silicones in the tissues. There was no statistically significant difference between women with cohesive gel implants and those with noncohesive gel implants.

Meaning

These findings suggest that cohesive silicone gel breast implants leak silicones and may potentially harm patients, as noncohesive gel implants do.

### Silent rupture of silicone gel breast implants: high-resolution ultrasound scans and surveys of 584 women [^0c2247db]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Most women choose silicone gel-filled breast implants because of their natural feel; however, Core clinical trial data show a high risk of rupture over 10 years – (Table 1). Because cross-linking makes silicone gel somewhat cohesive, it tends to remain within the capsular scar if the shell ruptures, maintaining the volume of the breast. This is why patients are not aware that an implant has ruptured and why it is called a "silent rupture". The ruptured implant may remain in place for years until discovered at a subsequent implant procedure, such as a size change, or diagnosed during evaluation of signs or symptoms, such as capsular contracture, pain, a lump, change in shape, or abnormal mammogram. At this time, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound scans of silicone gel implants to screen for silent rupture at 5 to 6 years after implantation and then every 2 to 3 years thereafter. The very low rate of patient compliance with magnetic resonance imaging screening, less than 5 percent, is attributed to the high cost and inconvenience of obtaining magnetic resonance imaging scans.

Table 1.
10-Year Cumulative Incidence of Rupture *

A low-cost, convenient alternative to magnetic resonance imaging scans is high-resolution ultrasound scans that can be performed in an office setting. High-resolution ultrasound scans have also proven to be as accurate as magnetic resonance imaging scans for detection of silent rupture of silicone gel implants. In 2012, Bengtson and Eaves showed that magnetic resonance imaging scans, surgeon-performed high-resolution ultrasound scans, and radiologist-performed high-resolution ultrasound scans were all accurate in predicting implant shell integrity in 29 of 29 imaged breasts (100 percent) as confirmed at the time of surgery. In 2020, the author (M.J.S.) reported on more than 1000 women with high-resolution ultrasound scans of their breast implants and showed a positive predictive value of 87 percent for women who had a confirmed rupture at surgery. There were no false-negative scans in his report.

### Assessment of risk factors for rupture in breast reconstruction patients with macrotextured breast implants [^1660bb2f]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We believe that providing accurate patient information before undergoing any BI procedure is instrumental, and we believe that disregarding recommendations with no scientific backing is one major step toward that objective. In our mostly reconstructive population, patient and operative variables did not significantly influence implant survival. The same could not be said regarding the use of underwire bras, car seat belts and mammography imaging which have shown to increase the likelihood of BI rupture. Despite our findings, while we can recommend patients not to use underwire bras postoperatively, the life-saving benefits from using car seat belts and mammographic imaging cannot be dismissed, regardless of the increased rupture risk. On the other hand, several historical concerns regarding postoperative management are long outmoded, including the fact that patients should be discouraged from lifting heavy weights to reduce the risk of rupture, and we speculate that increased muscular activity does not constitute a higher risk factor. Special considerations should be mentioned for AFT procedures in implant-based reconstructions, which are safe and are not linked with a higher likelihood of rupture. Finally, our evidence confirms that implant rupture rate is directly correlated with duration of implant indwelling. Our findings aim at improving everyday clinical practice with BIs. Nevertheless a larger scale study with greater cohorts could further highlight the influence of operative variables and patient lifestyle habits on implant survival and define standard guidelines.

### Short-term cost-effectiveness of one-stage implant-based breast reconstruction with an acellular dermal matrix versus two-stage expander-implant reconstruction from a multicentre randomized clinical trial [^f3366ae2]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide, breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, and its global societal and economic burden is enormous 1, 2. Improving treatment outcomes while controlling costs is a fundamental challenge faced by all healthcare systems 3. In Western countries, the 5‐year survival rate of women diagnosed with breast cancer is approximately 90 per cent 4, 5. Currently, there are more than 3.1 million breast cancer survivors in the USA alone 4. Over 60 000 new cases of in situ breast carcinoma are expected to be diagnosed among women in 2017 in the USA 6, indicating that the number of breast cancer survivors will increase progressively. More than 90 per cent of women receive surgical treatment, consisting of either lumpectomy or mastectomy 5. Today, breast reconstruction is offered as a standard treatment option after mastectomy in most developed countries, with the aim of improving long‐term outcomes and quality of life. As up to 20 per cent of women undergo breast reconstruction after a mastectomy, it is one of most common reconstructive procedures undertaken by plastic surgeons 7. An increase in immediate reconstructions has also been noted 8.

There are many surgical options for breast reconstruction, but it is not known which is most cost‐effective for an individual patient. Implant‐based breast reconstruction (IBBR) methods are used in approximately 80 per cent of reconstructions following mastectomy 9. IBBR is performed either in one or two stages, with or without the use of an additional tissue matrix. It has been suggested that one‐stage reconstruction augmented with an acellular dermal matrix (ADM) is more cost‐effective than two‐stage IBBR. Having only a single procedure and insertion of a larger breast implant because of enlargement of the subpectoral pocket are advantages of one‐stage ADM‐assisted IBBR. Improved aesthetic outcome with use of an ADM has been reported as an additional advantage. Several studies 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 that compared the cost‐effectiveness of different IBBR methods or IBBR with autologous reconstructions have reported conflicting data. In general, the additional use of an ADM was considered cost‐effective. In most studies, however, a decision analytical model was used, in which clinical outcomes based on previously published literature were incorporated in the analyses with various probabilities 11, 12, 14, 15. This method risks selection bias, as clinical outcomes after breast reconstruction vary considerably, with complication rates ranging from 4 to 50 per cent 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

### Silent rupture of silicone gel breast implants: high-resolution ultrasound scans and surveys of 584 women [^f3cc6319]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Core clinical trial data show that the risk of rupture of silicone gel implants increases as the length of time implanted increases. The same trend was seen in this study, with 3.4 to 5.3 percent of the implants implanted at least 3 years but less than 6 years (i.e. implanted 2012 through 2015) having a rupture on high-resolution ultrasound scans, compared to 25.0 to 50.0 percent of the implants implanted at least 14 years but less than 16 years (i.e. implanted 2002 through 2004) having a rupture on high-resolution ultrasound scans. The rupture percentages shown in Table 3 exemplify the overall trend of a higher prevalence of rupture as the time from implantation increases. These are not definitive rupture rates because this was not a controlled clinical trial and the sample sizes are small relative to the large number of implants implanted each year. Based on this study, at the initial U.S. Food and Drug Administration–recommended high-resolution ultrasound scan at 5 to 6 years, up to 5.3 percent of the women may already have a rupture; at the next U.S. Food and Drug Administration–recommended scan at 7 to 9 years, up to 13.6 percent of the women may have a rupture; and at the next scan at 9 to 12 years, up to 14.8 percent of the women may have a rupture.

### Silent rupture of silicone gel breast implants: high-resolution ultrasound scans and surveys of 584 women [^903e7264]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

In addition, in a 2018 study, the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound scans were 90 and 80 percent, respectively, and the sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging scans were 87 and 85 percent, respectively. The authors concluded that ultrasound evaluation may be the first-level examination in case of suspicious symptomatic breast implant rupture. In 2014, Rietjens et al. showed that the negative predictive value of ultrasound when evaluating breast implants for ruptures was 85 percent, meaning that in the case of negative ultrasound findings, magnetic resonance imaging scans may be avoided.

Unlike magnetic resonance imaging scans of an implant that is stationary, ultrasound scans are of an implant that is being manipulated by the operator to reveal shell details in real time that can confirm a rupture and minimize possible confusion with a shell fold. There are clear visual indicators on ultrasound images of a ruptured silicone gel implant. As with magnetic resonance imaging scans, high-resolution ultrasound scans can have false-positive and false-negative findings, so a plastic surgery consultation to discuss future monitoring or surgical options is essential when a ruptured implant is detected.

The prevalence of silent rupture among women who currently have silicone gel implants is unknown. The Core clinical trial data from the three U.S. manufacturers of silicone gel implants indicates that approximately 10 percent or more of women had an implant rupture during the 10 years after implantation (Table 1), but rupture data are not available beyond 10 years. The availability of high-resolution ultrasound scanning provides an opportunity to study a large number of women with silicone gel implants to determine the prevalence of silent rupture. In conjunction with scans, these same women can be surveyed to document their concerns and feelings about silent rupture, desire for rupture screenings, and choices for future implant surgery, which is information not previously reported.

### Rupture of 40-year-old silicone gel breast implants: a case report [^3c2d018e]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Since its invention, silicone breast implants have become essential for aesthetic and reconstructive plastic surgery globally. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, more than 300,000 breast augmentation procedures were performed in 2021, and breast augmentation has been among the top five cosmetic surgical procedures since 2006. In 2020, silicone and saline implants were used in 84% and 16% of all breast augmentations, respectively.

Implant rupture is a well-known complication of breast augmentation surgeries; breast implants cannot last forever. A previous study showed that an average rupture rate for silicone implants is 3–20 years. The 10-year rupture-free implant survival rate for intact implants at 3 years is estimated to be 83–85%, with older implants expected to have poorer survival rates. Core clinical trial data also divided the 10-year rupture rate according to different brands as follows: Allergan (Dublin, Ireland), 9.3–17.7%; Mentor (Irvine, CA, USA), 6.6–24.2%; and Sientra (Irvine, CA, USA), 8.7%. Some risk factors for rupture include wearing underwire bras and seat belts and undergoing mammography. Free silicone reacts with the surrounding tissues to form a fibrous capsule, owing to a natural foreign-body reaction. The cohesiveness of the silicone gel allows it to stay within the capsular scar when the shell ruptures, thereby maintaining breast volume. This manifests as a 'silent' implant rupture as no clinically significant signs or symptoms are observed, which explains the unawareness among patients. Silicone implant ruptures were recorded in 8% of asymptomatic women and 33% of symptomatic women. Symptomatic patients often present with size change, pain, lump, breast capsular contracture, or asymmetry. As a result, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recommended magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound of silicone gel implants at 5–6 years after implantation, and every 2–3 years thereafter to screen for silent rupture. Early detection will allow doctors and specialists to carry out early management of this condition. This case report discusses the rupture of breast implants and their removal 40 years after augmentation without regular follow-ups.

### Safety and effectiveness of silicone gel-filled breast implants in primary augmentation patients [^d8987a4d]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

The incidence of infection reported in this study (0.1%; 95% CI: 0.0%, 0.9%) is similar to that reported in the Core Study (1.6%; 95% CI: 0.9%, 3.1%). A study from 2010 suggests the incidence of bacterial infection to be between 2.0% and 2.5% for augmentation procedures and substantially higher (20%) for reconstructive procedures, suggesting a relatively low rate of infection for both the present study and the Core Study.

The rupture rate reported here is comparable to the overall rupture complaint rate from November 2006 to December 2017, which is 0.7% for over 2 million MemoryGel breast implants implanted in the United States (US Mentor MemoryGel Complaint Data statistics from November 2006 to December 2019). This rate is substantially lower than the 24.2% 10-year Kaplan-Meier estimated cumulative incidence rate of suspected or confirmed ruptures reported in the MemoryGel Core Study, likely due to the lack of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening leading to an underestimation of silent rupture. Whereas MRI screening was required in the Core Study, in normal clinical practice, physicians are merely advised to encourage regular MRI screenings. For example, in the MemoryGel Product Insert Data Sheet, it is recommended that the first MRI be performed 3 years postoperatively and every 2 years thereafter. A recent study that surveyed members of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons found that 55.0% of respondents (427/776 surgeons) reported that they do not follow up the MRI evaluations at the recommended intervals described in the Product Insert Data Sheet unless an issue arises. Just over one-third of respondents (293/776 surgeons; 37.8%) reported that they do follow the recommended guidelines. Possible reasons for the low rate of compliance include the low prevalence of rupture in asymptomatic patients, cost, and availability of resources. For instance, 1 study estimated the prevalence of rupture in asymptomatic women to be around 8%, and the average cost of an MRI to be $1197; hence, the guidelines are often not followed. Current literature also suggests that silent ruptures do not always exhibit clinically relevant symptoms; therefore, many women diagnosed with silent ruptures forgo surgery and opt for observation only. Due to the lack of required MRI screening in the present analysis population, it is likely that the rate presented here largely represents only symptomatic ruptures. In support of this theory, the Kaplan-Meier rupture rate in this analysis (1.6%) is much closer to the Core Study rate of symptomatic ruptures (0.6%) than to the rupture rate that included both suspected and confirmed ruptures.

### Safety and effectiveness of silicone gel-filled breast implants in primary augmentation patients [^430578e6]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Given the high incidence of asymptomatic ruptures reported in the literature, and because the significant costs associated with MRI lead to a high rate of noncompliance with the current recommended Food and Drug Administration guidelines, high-resolution ultrasound should be considered as an alternative method for detecting silent ruptures to provide a more accurate assessment of silicone gel breast implant shell failure. Bengtson and Eavesassessed the accuracy of detecting asymptomatic and symptomatic ruptures in 29 breasts with MRI, surgeon-performed high-resolution ultrasound, or radiologist-performed high-resolution ultrasound compared to surgical findings. They found that all 3 techniques were able to accurately identify ruptured implants. Because high-resolution ultrasound is noninvasive, safe, widely available, and accurate, and the 2011 Medicare Global Diagnostic Service Fee for bilateral MRI is 8.2 times that of a breast ultrasound, surgeons should consider utilizing this technology to detect silent ruptures.

Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that implant size was the most significant predictor of a complication, despite several studies demonstrating no correlation between implant size and complication rate. One study showed the opposite effect in a Kaplan-Meier analysis, reporting that times to reoperation, rupture, and capsular contracture were significantly less in implants ≤ 350cc compared with those in implants > 350cc (P < 0.001), but this study included patient requests for size change as reoperations, thus confounding the effect of size on true complications with the effect due to preference for a larger implant. The statistical significance of this result will require further investigation in a larger population that is powered to detect an effect size of this magnitude.

The multivariable Cox regression model of any self-reported complication (Table 4) also provides information on the difference in complication rates between subpectoral and prepectoral augmentation. Subpectoral placement resulted in a relatively lower rate of complications than found with prepectoral placement (HR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.07, 1.30); however, the results are not statistically significant (P = 0.109). Care should be taken in interpreting these results given that the majority of patients included in this analysis had their implants placed in the subpectoral plane (n = 757; 97.4%), with only 20 patients having their implants placed in the prepectoral plane (2.6%).

### Gram-positive bacteria increase breast implant-related complications: prospective analysis of 100 revised implants [^ff688ae4]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

However, if silicone is continuously released because of shell breakage and subclinical inflammatory processes are therefore present, the patient might be at risk of developing unnoticed immunologic change as precursors to rare oncologic transformation. Given the vast number of implants in patients, better diagnostic tools or screening examinations might help clinicians to detect patients at risk, ensure safety, and indicate treatment plans. However, such diagnostic tools are currently unavailable.–

Despite the results of our study, the overall applicability is limited, requiring additional investigations. Specific effects of conservative breast cancer therapy cannot be applied in a generalized fashion. In addition, patients react differently to genetic and environmental influences. Moreover, we do not know how the skin's microbiome in cancer patients behaves and what effects it has on the cellular immune response. Regardless of the significant correlations found in our study, specific causes for implant complications could not be revealed.

Although we observed that implant complications correlated with Gram-positive bacteria (23.8% overall) and implant rupture thus correlated significantly, we still encountered numerous implant-related complications without contamination (76.2%). In breast cancer patients, implant dislocation might be on account of expander positioning (submuscular), as their expansion cranially is less restricted. Similar events can be seen in women undergoing cosmetic augmentation. Because of longer indwelling time, patients experience changes in tissue elasticity, which can be seen in the dislocation of implants or breast tissue (eg, double-bubble or waterfall deformity). Moreover, oversized breast implants also entail changes in implant position and aesthetic preference.

In addition, possible material damage can contribute to implant complications. This finding is supported by the fact that expanders and definitive implants were also ruptured in our cohort, without being contaminated. Besides expanders demonstrating a high durability, their rupture rate has been estimated to range from 1% to 3%. This rate possibly increases after 1.5 years of indwelling time, yet our patients experienced second-stage reconstruction before 1 year. Therefore, no specific cause for tissue expander damage could be verified in our review.

### Rupture of 40-year-old silicone gel breast implants: a case report [^2839b845]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

After obtaining informed consent, the breast tumour in her right breast was excised (Fig. 3 b), both breast implants were removed, and capsulectomy was performed for both breasts (excision of the siliconoma of both breasts) in October 2022. The surgery was performed via her previous 3-cm inframammary incision. The implants and their surrounding capsules were removed from the subglandular layer. Next, the silicone gel was spread to the surrounding tissue (Fig. 3). Both implants were clinically intact, and the capsules were sent for pathological analysis.

Upon removal, the implants were reported to be 145-cc bilateral breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning Corporation (Fig. 4). The silicone gel was clear and yellowish. The shells were thick, without Dacron fixation patches on the posterior surface. Implants with this configuration were manufactured in the 1980s.

The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and was discharged the day after surgery. After 1 week, she visited our outpatient department for a follow-up examination. She did not exhibit or report any concerns regarding wound recovery. Immunohistochemical staining revealed siliconoma with lymphoid hyperplasia and calcification in the bilateral breasts with no signs of malignancy. However, the patient was satisfied with the postoperative results (Fig. 5).

### Systemic inflammatory disease resolution following cosmetic silicone breast implant removal [^251e5007]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A 37-year-old Caucasian woman presented with subacute, symmetrical inflammatory arthralgia, which was affecting her work. Apart from fatigue, she had no other constitutional symptoms. She had undergone cosmetic bilateral silicone breast implant surgery in 2008. Blood tests revealed erythrocyte sedimentation rate 53 mm/h, weakly positive antinuclear antibodies and IgG cardiolipin antibody, while breast ultrasound revealed a ruptured left silicone implant. The working diagnosis was systemic inflammatory disease of uncertain origin. She decided to have replacement, rather than removal, of her silicone breast implants privately, but her symptoms persisted postoperatively with a new erythema multiforme-like rash despite treatment with methotrexate and moderate dose prednisolone. Following further consultation with a National Health Service breast surgeon, her silicone implants were removed. Within 10 weeks of surgery, all immunomodulatory treatment was discontinued with complete symptom and inflammatory response resolution. This case illustrates that implant silicone can induce clinically significant systemic inflammatory disease and implant removal is essential for disease resolution.

### Multimodality imaging-based evaluation of single-lumen silicone breast implants for rupture [^7ed01dab]. Radiographics (2017). Low credibility.

Breast implants are frequently encountered on breast imaging studies, and it is essential for any radiologist interpreting these studies to be able to correctly assess implant integrity. Ruptures of silicone gel-filled implants often occur without becoming clinically obvious and are incidentally detected at imaging. Early diagnosis of implant rupture is important because surgical removal of extracapsular silicone in the breast parenchyma and lymphatics is difficult. Conversely, misdiagnosis of rupture may prompt a patient to undergo unnecessary additional surgery to remove the implant. Mammography is the most common breast imaging examination performed and can readily depict extracapsular free silicone, although it is insensitive for detection of intracapsular implant rupture. Ultrasonography (US) can be used to assess the internal structure of the implant and may provide an economical method for initial implant assessment. Common US signs of intracapsular rupture include the "keyhole" or "noose" sign, subcapsular line sign, and "stepladder" sign; extracapsular silicone has a distinctive "snowstorm" or echogenic noise appearance. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the most accurate and reliable means for assessment of implant rupture and is highly sensitive for detection of both intracapsular and extracapsular rupture. MR imaging findings of intracapsular rupture include the keyhole or noose sign, subcapsular line sign, and "linguine" sign, and silicone-selective MR imaging sequences are highly sensitive to small amounts of extracapsular silicone. © RSNA, 2017.

### Implant ruptures after augmentation mammoplasty [^7180b82f]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

This article discusses eleven cases of implant ruptures in nine patients that occurred 3–10 years after primary surgery. The implant ruptures were diagnosed by visual inspection, palpation, ultrasound and MRI of the breast. We describe rupture symptoms and treatment tactics depending on the characteristics of the rupture, the nature of the filler (liquid silicone, soft cohesive gel (Soft Touch™) or high cohesive silicone gel), the current condition of the soft tissues and presence of any complications. We present recommendations allowing early detection of an asymptomatic rupture.

### Reductive augmentation of the breast [^42c8fe20]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Reductive augmentation can be especially useful in patients with significant asymmetry in size and/or ptosis. Conventional methods of matching breast size in initially asymmetric patients, such as performing unilateral augmentation with contralateral mastopexy, or placing implants of disparate volume, can result in breasts that differ markedly in shape. In reductive augmentation, the size and shape of the breasts are better matched by removing the disparity in breast volume and placing implants of the same or similar size.

The different patterns of volume change between patients undergoing primary breast surgery and those previously augmented warrant further discussion. For individuals who had not been previously augmented, the average amount of tissue removed per breast was less than the average volume of the implant placed by 71 g. Although this amounts to a modest increase in net volume, breasts appear much smaller postoperatively because the volume is redistributed in a higher breast with more projection, less width, and greater superior pole fullness. Patients who had been augmented previously experienced more significant decreases in net breast volume, an average of 198 g. In many instances, the patient's implants were replaced by a higher-profile implant to achieve a round result. Many patients wanted to be smaller, but some wanted to be larger; however, they all wanted removal of inferior pole breast tissue and more upper pole fullness.

A 20% revision rate might seem high for most operations; however, only three (8.6%) required general anesthesia, and the rest were small revisions under local anesthesia. Recent publications have a revision rate of 14.6 and 23.2% for one-stage breast augmentation and mastopexy. Reductive augmentation is a huge undertaking with many steps and a three-dimensional remolding of the breast. It is important to sit the patient up after each major manipulation to achieve symmetry at each step and not get lost in the surgery. It is also crucially important to relay this to the patient, so they can accept and/or expect a minor or major revision, especially when starting to do this type of surgery. All of the techniques are standard surgical procedures that experienced breast surgeons perform; however, linking them into one operation can be challenging.

A discussion involving the pros and cons of performing a one-stage surgery versus a two-stage surgery in which a breast reduction is performed first and then a breast augmentation later can be debated. Reductive augmentation as presented allows a one-stage surgery to achieve a specific result in those patients who desire a round-appearing breast with greater upper pole fullness.

### Mortality rate in breast implant surgery: is an additional procedure worthwhile to mitigate BIA-ALCL risk? [^1035ac5c]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Breast Implant-Related Mortality Study

A total of 99,690 procedures were included, of which 57,369 assigned to cohort A (oncologic) and 42,321 to cohort B (non-oncologic). One case of perioperative mortality was identified in cohort A, but upon review of anonymous clinical data and hospital discharge forms, mortality was attributed to chest wall infiltration of a radiation-induced angiosarcoma, and therefore excluded. No cases were recorded in cohort B, leading to an overall mortality rate of 0:99,690 surgeries.

Review of Literature for Breast Implant Epidemiology

Of 1,277 potentially relevant manuscripts, 894 were excluded because not relevant to the topic and 383 included, but only 54 presented pertinent epidemiologic data.

Age at First Breast Implant Placement (A1P)

According to ASPS (2018), the mean A1P in patients who underwent cosmetic breast augmentation in the USA is 34 years. According to studies, the age for breast reconstruction ranges between 48 and 52 years (mean 50 years). Since the BIs augmentation-to-reconstruction ratio in the USA is 75% versus 25%, and in Italy 63% versus 37%, the mean A1P, regardless of indication, can be estimated as 34 × 0.75 + 50 × 0.25 = 38 years in USA, and 34 × 0.63 + 50 × 0.37 = 40 years in Italy.

Breast Implant Lifespan (BIL)

BIs are not lifetime devices, and the longer the indwelling, the likelier patients will experience adverse outcomes requiring revision. In 1998, Goodman et al analyzed 1099 implants and found that BIL was 16.4 years. In 2000, Benadiba et al. retrospectively analyzed 949 implants and reported a BIL of 10.6 years. More recent long-term data can be found in large post-approval and manufacturer-funded core studies, including Caplin et al. who followed 1008 patients (1898 implants) for 10 years and estimated a BIL of 7.9–8.3 years. By averaging the two largest reports on the latest generation of implants, BIL, defined as the period time between insertion and rupture or removal, was estimated at 9.34 years.

Women's Life Expectancy

Finally, WLE was found to be about 84.5 years in the USA and 85.4 years in Italy.

### Secondary breast augmentation: managing each case [^7cfde68c]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Implant Rupture

Rupture of the implant generally occurs in less than 1% of cases. The rupture can be intra- or extracapsular (Fig. 13 a and b). It can be caused by various factors including defects in the manufacture of the implant or deterioration, the passing of time, the shell of the implant, trauma, or an unnoticed rupture during surgery.

Fig. 13
a Magnetic resonance image (MRI) of intracapsular rupture (Linguine sign). b An MRI of extracapsular rupture

Rupture of the implant is associated with the breast's loss of shape. Physical examination can determine the diagnosis. The breast can be touched when it is extracapsular but not when it is intracapsular. However, because a margin of error is always possible, the diagnosis should be corroborated by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study.

When cohesive silicone implants rupture, the principal symptoms are contour irregularity and a palpable mass attributable to the capsular contracture. The symptoms of a ruptured saline implant are deformity of the contour and an abrupt collapse. With the rupture of liquid silicone gel implants, the symptoms are deformity of the contour, redness, and pain.

Inflatable saline implants can become deflated due to valve failure or leakage through folds, which happens when the implant becomes folded at some point, thus producing friction between the edges of the folds until the shell is ruptured. Should this occur, the implant must be extracted and the pocket cleaned, followed by the fitting of a new cohesive gel implant.

### Silent rupture of silicone gel breast implants: high-resolution ultrasound scans and surveys of 584 women [^eed9e84a]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Surveys of 584 women who had high-resolution ultrasound scans of their silicone gel breast implants show that they have concerns and feel anxious about having a silent rupture. Almost all would like to know whether their implant is ruptured, and most would replace it if ruptured. As an alternative to magnetic resonance imaging scans, high-resolution ultrasound scans are a convenient in-office way for plastic surgeons to monitor their silicone gel implant patients and screen for silent rupture. A plastic surgeon reviewer experienced with high-resolution ultrasound scans determined that 82 of the 584 women (14 percent) in this study had a ruptured implant on their scans. Based on 82 women showing a ruptured implant on high-resolution ultrasound scans and 75 percent of ruptures on high-resolution ultrasound scans in this study surgically confirmed, 10.6 percent of the 584 women in this study had a ruptured implant they were unaware of (i.e. a silent rupture). This study found a relatively high prevalence of silent rupture among women with silicone gel implants implanted for 3 to 20 years, with the rate of prevalence directly correlated to the length of time implanted.

### Short-term cost-effectiveness of one-stage implant-based breast reconstruction with an acellular dermal matrix versus two-stage expander-implant reconstruction from a multicentre randomized clinical trial [^5238e0dc]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

The BRIOS study was a prospective multicentre RCT. Eligible women were older than 18 years with breast carcinoma or a gene mutation linked to breast cancer, who intended to undergo skin‐sparing mastectomy and immediate IBBR. Women were assigned randomly to undergo one‐stage IBBR with ADM or two‐stage IBBR.

The objective was to compare outcomes of one‐stage IBBR combined with ADM (Strattice™; LifeCell, Branchburg, New Jersey, USA) with outcomes of conventional two‐stage tissue expander‐implant breast reconstruction. The primary endpoint of the BRIOS study was health‐related quality of life assessed using the BREAST‐Q at 1 year after placement of the definite implant. The study was open label, and surgeons and patients were informed about the allocated treatment at least 3 days before surgery. The full study design, methodology and surgical techniques have been described previously 21, 22. The secondary outcome of cost‐effectiveness is reported here.

The protocol was approved by the institutional review board from each study centre and the study was preregistered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR5446). All patients provided written informed consent. The BRIOS study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the Consort Statement 23 and guidelines for good clinical practice.

Outcome measures

The following data were recorded: duration of surgery, duration of hospital stay, number of outpatient visits for expander fill in patients who had a two‐stage procedure, and number of additional outpatient visits if a complication occurred. These data were collected for the primary breast reconstruction procedure, for the operations needed to treat surgical complications, and for secondary reconstructions if an implant was removed. The duration of surgery was defined as the time from first incision to closure of the wound. All planned second‐stage procedures were completed.

### RE: prosthetic breast implant rupture: imaging-pictorial essay: full cooperation between surgeon and radiologist: "The best of both worlds" [^413c9a9d]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Cooperation between plastic surgeons and radiologists is fundamental when breast prosthesis rupture is suspected. We describe our experience managing the case of suspected implant rupture in a patient that underwent CT scan imaging for thoracic pain. Poor clinical information given to radiologists leads to wrong diagnosis: during surgery, both prostheses were checked revealing no signs of rupture. Full communication among different specialists involved in the multidisciplinary approach is always recommended, and an easy-to-use national breast implant register would allow a better management of patients' follow-up and eventual preoperative planning.

### Presentation and management of silicone lymphadenopathy: a single institutional retrospective cohort study [^3f3ef024]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

None of the patients in the present study had surgical excision alone of the SL for management. Implants with rupture were managed most commonly by either implant removal or implant exchange. The most common indication for implant exchange was implant rupture, which aligns with the current literature. Prior studies have shown mixed results from excision of SL with some showing complete resolution of symptoms while others have shown recurrence or persistent symptoms. Therefore, it is crucial to emphasize that the excision of affected nodes has produced varied outcomes in terms of addressing patient symptomatology. If patients present with painful lymphadenopathy surgical excision should be considered. However, excision is generally not recommended in asymptomatic patients due to the potential risk of lymphedema. It is also crucial to recognize that removing implants does not cure SL, nor does it prevent the development of future lymphadenopathy. Moreover, during the removal of breast implants, there is a risk of spreading silicone, which could exacerbate the patient's symptoms. Therefore, it is essential to have a thorough discussion with patients about these risks and potential outcomes as part of the decision-making process. Treatment plans should be customized based on the imaging results and the patient's clinical history. Accordingly, individuals with SL who do not have a history of breast cancer are not required to undergo additional monitoring beyond standard breast cancer screening guidelines.

This is a retrospective study conducted at a single institution. The screening protocols implemented at our tertiary care academic center may not be generalizable to smaller hospitals. Given that this condition is not commonly encountered, the number of cases will inherently remain limited. The search terminology used might have missed a few cases that were reported as reactive lymphadenopathy. A multi-institutional study would allow for a larger and more diverse patient population, thereby enhancing the generalizability of the findings.

### Silent rupture of silicone gel breast implants: high-resolution ultrasound scans and surveys of 584 women [^ea7eb901]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Compared to the inconvenience and high cost of magnetic resonance imaging equipment and scans, a plastic surgery practice can offer women the convenience of in-office high-resolution ultrasound scans for a modest investment (up to $10,000 for equipment and training) and a low cost per scan (up to $250). This would allow plastic surgeons to follow and screen their silicone gel implant patients for silent rupture according to U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommendations, or more frequently if desired by the patient.

Plastic surgeons, nurses, and medical assistants were able to quickly learn how to obtain high-resolution ultrasound scans of breast implants and analyze them for possible silent rupture, which is usually clearly shown by manipulating the implant while obtaining the scan. As expected, these investigators with limited experience had a tendency to overread scans (i.e. of the 141 implant scans they interpreted as a suspected rupture, only 73 were interpreted as a rupture by the plastic surgeon reviewer experienced with high-resolution ultrasound scans). If a plastic surgeon with limited high-resolution ultrasound experience has a scan that is suspicious but does not clearly show a rupture, before recommending surgery, the patient can be referred for a repeated high-resolution ultrasound scan by a high-resolution ultrasound–experienced surgeon or radiologist, or referred for a magnetic resonance imaging scan. In addition, during preoperative consultations, a surgeon can provide their rate of false-positive surgical findings in implants with high-resolution ultrasound scans that they interpreted as ruptured. The women could then proceed knowing the likelihood that an implant interpreted as ruptured on a high-resolution ultrasound scan will be confirmed ruptured at surgery. In contrast, of 1012 implant scans interpreted as not ruptured by these investigators with limited experience, only 19 scans were interpreted as a suspected rupture by the ultrasound training consultant, and then confirmed as ruptured by the plastic surgeon reviewer (i.e. 98.1 percent true-negative scans; 1.9 percent false-negative scans).

### What exactly was wrong with the trilucent breast implants? A unifying hypothesis [^c0a00558]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Trilucent soybean oil-filled breast implants were initially announced as the ultimate prostheses for breast augmentation. However, after an increasing number of reports of local complications and hazardous metabolites attributable to lipid oxidation, first the United Kingdom Medical Devices Agency and later the Belgian National Ministry of Health urged all plastic surgeons to contact their patients and advise them to have the implants removed and, if desired, replaced with another type of prosthesis. In our plastic surgery department, 13 patients received bilateral implants with triglyceride-filled prostheses between February and July of 1996, for primary breast augmentation or replacement of previously implanted prostheses. For 12 of those 13 patients, the prostheses have been explanted, because of unilateral breast enlargement attributable to a ruptured prosthesis for five patients and following the recommendation of the Belgian National Ministry of Health for the other seven patients. Before explantation, all patients underwent standard clinical examinations, with assessments of breast shape, volume, and firmness. Blood analyses were performed, with a special focus on liver enzymes, as were urinalyses. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained before explantation; for two patients, the scans revealed a fluid level separating two liquid layers in an intact prosthesis. This is the first report of such a finding. The removed implants were examined for any damage or shell deterioration and for changes in color and viscosity, the weights and volumes were measured and compared with the initial values for the implanted prostheses, and complete biochemical analyses of the accumulated fluid in cases of ruptured prostheses and of the filler material in cases of intact prostheses were performed. This small but well-documented series illustrates the multitude of problems associated with triglyceride-filled implants, including bleeding of the triglyceride filler; shell deterioration, as indicated by a loss of texture and extreme fragility of the implant (with rupture or delamination with a simple finger touch); an increase in osmotic pressure exerted by the degraded filler material; progressive weakening of the outer silicone shell, with influx of plasma proteins of up to 750 kDa, eventually resulting in rupture of the prosthesis; a lack of oxidative stability and the formation of toxic oxidation products; a lack of biocompatibility, with the formation of insoluble organic soap-like material; and a pronounced inflammatory reaction. It is concluded that the sequential and/or simultaneous occurrence of (1) implant bleeding, (2) lipid infiltration of the silicone elastomer, and (3) inflammation attributable to oxidation products provides an overall explanation or unifying hypothesis for the wide variety of adverse events related to soybean oil-filled implants.

### Silent rupture of silicone gel breast implants: high-resolution ultrasound scans and surveys of 584 women [^65096621]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background:

Patient compliance has been low for U.S. Food and Drug Administration–recommended magnetic resonance imaging scans to screen silicone gel breast implants for silent rupture. High-resolution ultrasound scans are a convenient, in-office alternative that may improve screening compliance; however, women's attitudes and feelings about silent rupture and their desire for rupture screening are unknown.

Methods:

Plastic surgeons and staff in nine private practices received 1-day training in high-resolution ultrasound scanning, then screened women with silicone gel implants implanted since 2000. Suspect scans were reviewed by a high-resolution ultrasound–experienced plastic surgeon to determine if they showed ruptures. Surgical and scan findings were correlated. To learn attitudes and feelings about silent rupture, women took surveys before and after the scan.

Results:

Of 584 women screened, 82 (14.0 percent) had scans showing ruptures; of 1153 implants, 92 (8.0 percent) showed ruptures. Forty women with scans showing ruptures underwent surgery, of which 30 (75 percent) had their ruptures confirmed. Surveys found 99.5 percent of women want to know if they have a rupture and 95.2 percent want the ruptured implant removed. If the scan showed no rupture, women felt relieved and 95.5 percent would get future high-resolution ultrasound screening for silent rupture. If a rupture was found, women expressed various concerns and 87.8 percent would remove the ruptured implant within 12 months.

Conclusions:

Surveys show that women with silicone gel implants have concerns and feel anxious about possible silent rupture. Based on 14 percent of women showing a ruptured implant on high-resolution ultrasound scans and 75 percent of ruptures on high-resolution ultrasound scans surgically confirmed, 10.6 percent of women in this study have a silent rupture.

### Complications after two-stage expander implant breast reconstruction requiring reoperation: a critical analysis of outcomes [^1edfa6bd]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Two-stage expander implant breast reconstruction is commonly performed after mastectomy. Salvage and long-term outcomes after development of complications have not been well described. We examined a single surgeon's experience to study the rate of reoperation secondary to complications after first-stage expander placement and to evaluate their outcomes. Better understanding of salvage techniques may help guide future management.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients who underwent placement of a tissue expander (TE) for breast reconstruction between December 2006 and August 2015 with the senior author. Patient demographics including age, body mass index, medical comorbidities, history of smoking, and history of radiation to the breast were collected. Surgical factors including timing of reconstruction (immediate vs delayed) and location of TE (total submuscular vs with acellular dermal matrix) were recorded. Complications were analyzed, as were patients who underwent reoperation in the setting of developing a complication.

Results

We analyzed 282 patients who underwent 453 implant-based breast reconstructions. Of these, 39 patients and 45 breasts required a reoperation after development of a postoperative complication. Return to the operating room was associated with higher body mass index (29 vs 24, P < 0.001), higher TE initial fill volume (299 mL vs 169 mL, P < 0.001), and preoperative radiation (31% vs 13%, P = 0.001). Complications resulting in reoperation included infection (60%), mastectomy skin necrosis (27%), and TE extrusion through thin mastectomy skin (11%). The affected TE was removed and exchanged in 17 patients (38%), autologous flap reconstruction occurred in 16 patients (36%), and TE was explanted without replacement in 12 patients (27%).

Conclusions

Infectious complications including cellulitis and abscess formation accounted for most cases requiring reoperation after TE placement for breast reconstruction. More than a quarter of patients who underwent a reoperation ultimately lost their implants. Patients undergoing two-stage expander implant breast reconstruction should be appropriately counseled regarding the possibility of requiring a reoperation in the setting of developing a complication.

### Management of a late breast implant rupture in the setting of previous radiation [^924b0801]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Management of ruptured breast implants is scarcely discussed in the literature, especially in the setting of previous breast cancer and radiation. The authors present an uncommon presentation of late breast implant rupture with seroma and history of prior radiation. It is important to acknowledge the increased risk of wound healing complications in patients who are several years' postradiation therapy for breast cancer and should be an important factor when discussing treatment options with the patient.

### Breast augmentation: part III – preoperative considerations and planning [^3f6eba42]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The past four decades since the introduction of silicone mammary prostheses have seen significant improvements in their quality and durability. Advances in our understanding of the aetiopathology and prevention of adverse capsular contracture (ACC) have occurred such that surgical technique itself has now probably become the single most important determinant of both immediate and long-term outcome. Considered a simple, and in some quarters mindless, procedure it has evolved such that high-quality short- and stable long-term results are now expected. Whilst the fundamentals of breast augmentation (BA) remain, evolutionary philosophies confront today's surgeon with a wealth of options. Of fundamental importance has been the paradigm shift from a purely, or predominantly, volumetric, through biodimensional to a tissue-based approach. With BA, more than any other aesthetic procedure, possessing more variables, choice and influential external factors a thorough understanding of the myriad options available is essential. This review seeks to cover the key elements in obtaining an optimal primary result. It provides a rational basis for the selection of an option tailored to both the patient and the individual tissue characteristics in addition to the pertinent medico-legal issues.

### Immediate breast reconstruction after neoadjuvant chemotherapy: factors associated with surgical selection and complications [^fda4cffb]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

All 10 patients with major complications in IBR group underwent the subpectoral 2-stage procedure. Of the 3 patients with capsular contracture requiring surgery, one did not undergo PMRT, and capsule release was performed when replacing the tissue expander with the prosthesis. The other 2 patients both underwent PMRT; surgery for capsular contracture was performed after more than 6 months of PMRT. Of the 5 infections, 2 occurred just after the tissue expander was inserted and one occurred 2 months after tissue expander implantation when the patient was undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy before PMRT. One infection appeared 1 month after the replacement of the permanent prosthesis; that patient finished radiotherapy for 8 months then. The remaining infection occurred during radiotherapy. Regarding the 2 patients with implant break, one had TE break and leakage during PMRT; therefore, the TE was removed. The other patient underwent TE replacement with a silicone prosthesis 6 months after finishing PMRT. At 3 months after surgery, a light-yellow gel-like substance flowed out of the incision. The prosthesis was removed, and a small breach was found during surgery; therefore, it was replaced with a new prosthesis (Supplementary Table 1).

The median duration of hospitalization after surgery in the IR group was 6 days. The duration of hospitalization was longer in the ATR group (median, 6 days; range, 5–8 days; P = 0.008) than in the IBR and combined reconstruction groups (median, 5 days in each) (Table 5).

### Chronic pulmonary silicone embolism after breast implant rupture: an underdiagnosed cause of acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia? [^7412b353]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Treatment, outcome and follow-up

The catamnesis revealed that the left breast implant, which had been replaced 20 years ago, ruptured during a cardiac massage because of acute myocardial infarction 10 years before removal. Two breast MRI studies that had been performed before removal revealed an intracapsular rupture of the left retro-pectoral breast prosthesis associated with axillary and intramammary adenopathy. A breast MRI carried out just before removal had shown multiple left axillary lymph node silicomas associated with the previous rupture. Thus, the patient had been wearing the ruptured left breast implant for 5 years before it was replaced and finally removed 1 year before actual presentation. The pre-sternal implant shows no signs of rupture. She had no history of silicone injections and no other significant past exposure.

The patient was started on prednisone (1 mg/kg). The oxygen was rapidly weaned off, the fever resolved, the inflammatory syndrome regressed and the patient was discharged 3 weeks after admission in good general condition.

During follow-up, the patient describes a clear improvement in her general condition and dyspnoea, which unfortunately persists on exertion and remains disabling. A follow-up chest CT (figure 4) performed 4 months after hospitalisation showed complete disappearance of pulmonary condensations and ground glass opacities.

### Study of silicone gel breast implant rupture, extracapsular… [^e8cfbb27]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

The FDA has recently completed a study on the health effects of ruptured silicone gel breast implants. The study was published in the May 2001 Journal of Rheumatology. FDA conducted this study because of concerns about the frequency and results of rupture. Rupture is a concern because:

- Rupture of silicone gel-filled implants may allow silicone to migrate through the tissues. The relationship of free silicone to development or progression of disease is unknown.
- Implant rupture is a device failure
- the implant is no longer performing as intended.
- After the questionnaire was completed, women underwent a magnetic resonance imaging examination of their breasts to detect whether their current implants were intact or ruptured. The MRI examination can also tell whether silicone gel has leaked outside of the fibrous scar capsule that forms around the breast implant. Results.
- Women with MRI diagnosed breast implant rupture were no more likely than women with intact implants to report that they had either persistent symptoms or doctor-diagnosed illnesses that were listed.
- Women with MRI-diagnosed extracapsular silicone gel were 2. 8 times more likely to report that they had the soft tissue syndrome, fibromyalgia. This association remained statistically significant after taking into account other factors including whether women thought their implants were ruptured, implant age, and implant manufacturer. Fibromyalgia is a syndrome characterized by widespread pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance.
- Women with MRI-diagnosed extracapsular silicone gel were 2. 7 times more likely to report that they had "other connective tissue disease, " a category that included a diverse group of illnesses such as dermatomyositis, polymositis, and mixed connective tissue disease.

This association did not remain statistically significant after taking into account other factors including whether women thought their implants were ruptured, implant age, and implant manufacturer. Strengths of this Study This is the first study in which the status of all women's breast implants, with respect to rupture, has been known. Conclusions The data suggest an association between extracapsular silicone gel and fibromyalgia. If other studies are consistent with these findings, women should be informed of the potential risk of developing fibromyalgia if their breast implants rupture and silicone gel escapes the fibrous scar capsule.

### Will 1-stage implant salvage after periprosthetic breast infection ever be routine? A 6-year successful experience [^5fbf38ab]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Concomitant with the recent increase in breast augmentations has been an increase in periprosthetic infections necessitating further surgery. The conventional treatment of periprosthetic infections has been a multistage procedure involving explantation, control of infection, and reimplantation.

Objectives

The authors describe a 1-stage salvage procedure for the management of periprosthetic infections. This technique may become the standard for managing infection following cosmetic breast surgery.

Methods

The authors performed a retrospective review of all patients who had periprosthetic infection following cosmetic breast augmentation. The treatment included explantation, sequential cleaning of the wound, and immediate insertion of a new prosthesis and drain. All patients received intravenous antibiotics postoperatively. Of 3012 patients undergoing primary breast augmentation, periprosthetic infection developed in 17 patients. These 17 patients underwent 1-stage implant salvage. Patients were monitored for ≤ 6 years.

Results

All implants were retained; aesthetic results were satisfactory; and no significant adverse events were recorded after implant salvage.

Conclusions

One-stage implant salvage for periprosthetic infection has similar outcomes to conventional multistage procedures and may be preferred by patients.

### Current state of evidence-based long-term monitoring protocols for breast plastic surgery patients [^d5e9636d]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the cost-prohibitive nature of MRI imaging, some have proposed using alternatives such as mammography or ultrasound. Mammography has limited sensitivity in detecting gel implant ruptures, estimated at approximately 20%, due to the homogenous presentation of silicone gel on X-ray imaging. Ultrasound does not have as high of a sensitivity for implant rupture compared with MRI, with detection estimates in the 60% range, but it is significantly more cost effective.– Rietjens et al.found that ultrasound had a negative predictive value of 85%, therefore if the ultrasound findings are negative, MRI may not be necessary. They proposed screening asymptomatic women with ultrasound every year and with MRI every 5 years.

In 2020, the FDA changed their recommendations for asymptomatic silicone implant rupture to include ultrasound or MRI starting 5–6 years after initial surgery and every 2–3 years thereafter. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) refers to these FDA guidelines on their own website. Of note, the FDA does not currently have recommendations regarding saline implants, although saline implant rupture is nearly always clinically detectable due to the design of the implant. The American College of Radiology (ACR) most recently issued guidelines in 2018 regarding breast implant evaluation. In contrast to the FDA, the ACR stated that there was no clear role for imaging of saline implants or silicone implants in asymptomatic patients, based on meta-analyses with level 1 evidence. Clinical suspicion for rupture in patients with saline implants is best evaluated with ultrasound, with no role for MRI in the evaluation of saline implants. For suspected abnormalities in patients with silicone implants, the ACR guidelines recommend imaging with ultrasound or non-contrast MRI if there are suspected implant complications. In contrast to both the FDA and ACR guidelines, the British Society of Breast Radiology, Association of Breast Surgery Great Britain & Ireland, and the British Association of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons also recommend against routine imaging in asymptomatic patients. They recommend that ultrasound should be the first-line modality for any implant concerns, with subsequent MRI follow-up if the ultrasound is equivocal or if there are persistent clinical concerns despite normal ultrasound imaging. These findings are summarized and compared in Table 2.

### Pre-pectoral breast reconstruction: surgical and patient-reported outcomes of two-stages vs single-stage implant-based breast reconstruction [^a24ca49e]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients and Methods

A retrospective observational study was set up analyzing all patients who underwent two-stage breast reconstruction with pre-pectoral expander with ADM and subsequent replacement with implants (Group 1). The control group (Group 2) was set up by including the same number of consecutive patients who underwent pre-pectoral DTI reconstruction with prosthesis with ADM in the same time interval. All patients underwent a pre-operative assessment during which they were informed of the different treatment options (heterologous and autologous). Patients enrolled who underwent postoperative radiotherapy were not scheduled preoperatively; for this reason, a heterologous reconstruction was performed in any case. All patients were operated at the same hospital by the same team consisting of a senior and a junior surgeon. After the mastectomy conducted by the breast surgeon, a clinical evaluation of the mastectomy flaps was performed (indocyanine green). In cases of doubtful or poor tissue viability, a tissue expander was placed retropectorally or reconstruction was postponed, and patients were excluded from the study. If the mastectomy flaps were deemed suitable for immediate single-stage reconstruction, the pre-pectoral pocket was measured, and the patient underwent prosthesis with ADM placement. A textured prostheses (Mentor Corporation, Santa Barbara, Calif. US) were implanted in all patients. The choice of textured prostheses was determined by institutional supply agreements and not by clinical factors. The ADMs used were Braxon (DECOmed s.r.l, Venice, Italy), Surgimend PRS Meshed and Surgimend PRS (Integra LifeScience, Plainsboro, New Jersey, US). In cases where the skin flaps appeared suitable for a pre-pectoral reconstruction, but it was deemed preferable to defer the placement of the definitive implant, the placement of a tissue expander was opted for. The tissue expander was wrapped with ADM that was fixed by resorbable stitches, taking special care to remove any excess matrix not needed to cover the implant. The expander was inflated with saline and methylene blue solution in an amount corresponding to 50 percent of the volume of the breast removed. Suction drains were inserted and kept in place until the 24-hour drainage was less than 30cc. Before implant placement, the breast pocket was washed with disinfectant iodine solution, Gentamicin and Cefazolin. The expander was then inserted into the pre-pectoral pocket and secured to the pectoralis muscle fascia to prevent implant rotation using resorbable sutures (Fig. 1). All patients underwent reconstruction with the same tissue expanders (Mentor Corporation, Santa Barbara, Calif. US). The ADMs used were the same as those used in DTI reconstructions with prostheses. All patients were evaluated regularly every 2 weeks on an outpatient basis, and the expander was progressively inflated with 40–50 cc to the desired volume (the final expansion volume was about 20% greater than the volume of the contralateral breast). All expanders in the study were replaced by anatomical textured breast implants (Mentor Corporation, Santa Barbara, Calif. US) between one and two months after the last filling. If the pinch test was not satisfactory, patients underwent lipofilling either before or after the expander replacement surgery with implants (Figs. 2 and 3). Exclusion criteria were entirely submuscular or dual plane reconstructions, reconstructions with autologous flaps, and delayed reconstructions. The two groups were compared according to the analyzed parameters such as age, BMI, smoking and comorbidities, pre- and postoperative RT and chemotherapy, type and weight of mastectomy, sentinel lymph node and axillary dissection, histology of carcinoma, use of drains, additional surgical procedures, major complications (requiring treatment in the operating theater) and minor complications (managed on an outpatient basis).

### Silent rupture of silicone gel breast implants: high-resolution ultrasound scans and surveys of 584 women [^8a13f025]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Of the 584 women who received screening scans, 115 women had scans interpreted by the investigator as a suspected rupture, comprising 141 implants. The other 469 women had scans interpreted by the investigator as not ruptured, but on secondary analysis by the ultrasound training consultant, 16 women had scans interpreted as a suspected rupture, comprising 19 implants. These suspected rupture scans were sent to the plastic surgeon reviewer who determined that 82 of the 584 women (14 percent) had a high-resolution ultrasound scan showing a ruptured implant, comprising 92 of the 1153 implants (8 percent). Table 2 shows the characteristics of these 92 ruptured implants.

Table 3 stratifies all 1153 implants scanned and the 92 ruptured implants by the year implanted. For each year, the number of implants ruptured is shown as a percentage of the number of implants scanned.

Table 3.
Scanned and Ruptured Implants versus Year Implanted

Of the 82 women with a ruptured implant on final interpretation of their scans by the high-resolution ultrasound–experienced plastic surgeon reviewer, 40 had surgery of which the presence of a ruptured implant was confirmed in 30 (75 percent true-positive scans; 25 percent false-positive scans). Extrapolating from these findings, if all 82 of the women with a ruptured implant on final review of their scans had undergone surgery, a ruptured implant would have been confirmed in 62 (75 percent), which is 10.6 percent of the 584 women in this study. In addition, some of the 502 women who did not have a ruptured implant on final interpretation of their scans might have a ruptured implant confirmed if they had surgery (i.e. they had false-negative scans). For example, although not ruptured on final interpretation of their scans, the contralateral implant was incidentally found ruptured in four of the 40 women who underwent surgery. Responses to the prescan and postscan surveys are shown in Tables 4 through 6.

### Breast ultrasound: recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European society of breast imaging [^2969fe83]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with breast implants

Breast US is usually the first line examination performed in women with implants to investigate breast implant complications that may present with pain, lumps, or asymmetries. It can be used to detect alterations of the implant structure, typically subdivided into intracapsular ruptures (when the implant envelope is broken but the silicon remains inside the capsule) and extracapsular ruptures (when the silicone leaks out of the broken capsule). Of note, the fibrotic capsule around the implant develops through a natural foreign body reaction of the breast tissues to the implant.

Considering breast implant integrity, US is a very specific, although not very sensitive, method: if an implant rupture is suspected on US, the probability of a true rupture is high; conversely, if no rupture is visible on US, a rupture (mostly intra-capsular) is still possible. In addition, US is useful in diagnosing other implant complication such as infection, seroma, or granuloma. MRI is the usual second step after US in this setting, especially for detecting intracapsular ruptures unnoticed with US.

There are no contraindications to performing US-guided interventions (biopsy, preoperative localisation) in women with breast implants.
Note F. If you have breast implants, for either aesthetic reasons or from oncoplastic surgery, and a breast examination is planned (including US), please give the radiologist a complete information about the type of your breast implant, if this information is available to you. There are many implant types (e.g. double or single lumen, silicone-only or silicone and saline solution, etc.) and the diagnostic performance is increased when the radiologist is aware of the type of implant you have.

Intraoperative US lesion identification and US of specimens

Although it is not commonly used in clinical practice, some experiences have been reported about the use of US for perioperative lesion identification in breast conserving surgery, with the aim of better margin management. Ultrasound of the surgical specimen may be used for evaluating the presence of the lesion and resection margin status, especially in the case of non-palpable lesions not associated with calcifications or not identifiable at mammography.

### Physical properties of silicone gel breast implants [^709ec19b]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Numerous breast implant options are available for various surgical applications, such as augmentation, revision-augmentation, and reconstruction surgery. Available implants differ in multiple fundamental ways, including shape (round vs anatomical), size, gel material and characteristics, fill ratio, and shell surface texture, which may influence aesthetic outcome and device performance. The decision on which implant to use may be based on a variety of factors, including breast anatomy and tissue measurements, surgeon experience, specific surgical application, and patient and surgeon preference. Current practice focuses on the shape and fill material of breast implants as important factors in selection. However, other physical properties also help differentiate among available implants and aid in the selection process. In the present report, we describe physical testing of 3 textured shaped, 6 textured round, and 8 smooth round silicone gel breast implants manufactured by Allergan (Allergan plc, Dublin, Ireland), Mentor (Santa Barbara, CA), Sientra (Santa Barbara, CA), and Establishment Labs (Alajuela, Costa Rica) in a laboratory setting. This is the first time that similar implants from different manufacturers have been compared with respect to key characteristics that can be objectively and quantitatively measured, including form stability, gel material properties, and shell thickness.

### Is one-stage breast augmentation with mastopexy safe and effective? A review of 186 primary cases [^de0c43c8]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Although some authors have reported that 1-stage breast augmentation with mastopexy does not increase the risks of surgery, recent literature has raised the question of whether better results might be achieved by staging the procedures.

Objective

The authors evaluated the safety and efficacy of 1-stage breast augmentation with mastopexy in their own patients by analyzing long-term complication and revision rates.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed of 186 consecutive patients who underwent primary 1-stage breast augmentation with mastopexy at a single outpatient facility. Patient data recorded included age, body mass index, smoking status, degree of breast ptosis, and any preoperative asymmetry. Operation-related data recorded included type of mastopexy performed, operating surgeon, length of surgery, American Society of Anesthesiologists level, and concomitant procedures. Data on implant type, volume, and position were also collected. Complication and revision rates were recorded and calculated.

Results

Ninety-six patients (44%) received saline implants; 104 (56%) received silicone implants. In most cases, textured implants were placed in submuscular pockets. The mean implant volume was 320 cc. Inverted T mastopexy was performed in 60% of cases, circumareolar in 24% of cases, and vertical or crescent accounted for most of the remainder. No severe complications occurred, although 1 patient developed a late infection that required removal of the breast implant. The most common complication was saline implant deflation (5.9%), although saline implants were used in less than half of cases. Thirty-one patients (16.7%) underwent some form of revision surgery within the average 42-month follow-up period.

Conclusions

Our review of 1-stage breast augmentation with mastopexy procedures revealed no severe complications. Although the overall revision rate of 16.7% is significant, it is comparable to rates for breast augmentation alone and is significantly lower than the 100% reoperation rate required for a staged procedure. In our experience, it is a safe and effective procedure, although one that is not easy to perform. Patients should be advised of the possibility that a second procedure may be necessary.

### Short-term cost-effectiveness of one-stage implant-based breast reconstruction with an acellular dermal matrix versus two-stage expander-implant reconstruction from a multicentre randomized clinical trial [^075b5923]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The results indicate that, from an institutional perspective, costs of one‐stage IBBR with ADM reconstruction are higher than those of two‐stage reconstruction, whereas reimbursement for the one‐stage reconstruction is lower. This was true when the primary procedure alone was taken into account. The difference in costs between the two methods increased when the costs of additional procedures to treat surgical complications were also included. The major factors contributing to this difference were the price of the implant material and costs related to a higher complication rate.

Previous authors have used a mixture of perspectives to estimate costs, such as a third‐party payer perspective with supplementary costs of ADM included in the calculations. Only a few studies 13–15,25 have reported on costs of ADMs in one‐stage implant‐based breast reconstruction. None of these analyses was based on prospectively collected data, but costs were derived theoretically by adopting a third‐party payer perspective, and analyses usually included data from literature reviews to estimate complication rates. Using this method, de Blacam and co‐workers 14 compared one‐stage IBBR versus ADM with two‐stage IBBR with and without ADM. ADM‐assisted one‐stage IBBR was the least expensive approach; this was still the case if the incremental costs of complications were included. The probability of complications was based on previously published literature. However, when an ADM was used, the authors adjusted for the extended duration of operation only and did not include the material costs of ADM. The authors noted that Medicare reimbursement of breast reconstruction with ADM is erroneously low, that the relative increase in cost incurred by the use of ADM is substantial when extrapolated nationwide, and that the excess costs associated with ADMs are amplified by the higher incidence of complications associated with their use. Johnson et al. 13 also compared ADM‐assisted one‐stage IBBR with conventional two‐stage IBBR. They used retrospective data from 24 patients in the one‐stage and 22 in the two‐stage group to assess surgery‐related variables and complications. Costings were based on the tariffs governing reimbursement in the National Health Service in England, and the actual costs of ADM were added to the cost calculations. In contrast to actual costs, tariffs in England are the same for unilateral and bilateral procedures, giving a rather skewed picture, where one‐stage IBBR seemed less costly than two‐stage IBBR in unilateral procedures, but more costly in bilateral procedures. In another retrospective cohort study 25, no significant cost differences between two‐stage IBBR and one‐stage ADM‐assisted IBBR were reported, but details regarding the perspective and methods to calculate costs were lacking. In a Canadian study 15, costs of direct‐to‐implant reconstruction with AlloDerm® (LifeCell, Branchburg, New Jersey, USA) were compared with two‐stage non‐AlloDerm® reconstruction. The payment system in Canada is not based on DRGs, and costs from the third‐party payer perspective corresponded closely to direct costs from the hospital perspective. Expected costs were calculated by means of a decision analytical model using data from previous studies. Based on similar complication rates in both groups and an assumed 10 per cent lower capsular contraction rate in the one‐stage group, expected costs of one‐stage reconstruction were lower. Total costs were sensitive to the price of the ADM and duration of operation; it was shown that variation in these factors may tip the balance of cost advantage between the two procedures.

### The diagnosis of silicone breast-implant rupture: clinical findings compared with findings at magnetic resonance imaging [^e1eb7713]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The objective was to evaluate the usefulness of clinical examination in the evaluation of breast-implant integrity, using the diagnosis at magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the "gold standard". Fifty-five women with 109 implants underwent a breast examination either just before or shortly after an MRI examination. Twenty-four of 109 implants were clinically diagnosed with possible rupture or rupture. Eighteen of the 24 implants were ruptured according to the MRI examination (75%). Eighty-five implants were clinically classified as intact, and 43 of these were actually ruptured at MRI (51%). The sensitivity of the clinical examination for diagnosing rupture was thus 30% and the specificity 88%. The positive predictive value of a clinical diagnosis of rupture was 75%, and the negative predictive value was 49%. In this study, we found that when a clinical examination is used as the sole diagnostic tool to identify implant rupture, neither the sensitivity nor the specificity is acceptable.

### Risk factors associated with complication rates of Becker-Type expander implants in relation to implant survival: review of 314 implants in 237 patients [^ab873705]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Although autologous tissue reconstruction is the best option for breast reconstruction, using implants is still a reliable and simple method, offering acceptable aesthetic results. Becker-type implants are permanent implants that offer a 1-stage reconstructive option. A retrospective study was carried out in our center reviewing the clinical reports of 237 patients, in whom a total of 314 Becker-type prostheses were implanted. Overall survival was calculated using a Kaplan-Meier estimate. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios. At the end of the study, 214 expanders (68.15%) presented no complications, 40 (12.47%) developed significant capsular contracture, in 27 (8.60%) infection occurred, 24 (7.64%) suffered minor complications, and 9 (2.87%) ruptured. The mean survival time of the expanders was 120.41 months (95% CI: 109.62, 131.19). Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, high Molecular Immunology Borstel, age, mastectomy performed previously to the implant, ductal carcinoma, advanced tumoral stage, experience of the surgeon, and Becker 35-type implants were significantly related to a high number of complications in relation to the survival of the implants. Cox regression analysis revealed that the main risk factors for the survival of expander implants included radiotherapy and surgeon experience. The complication hazard ratio or relative risk caused by these 2 factors was 1.976 and 1.680, respectively. One-stage reconstruction using Becker-type expanders is an appropriate, simple, and reliable option in delayed breast reconstruction in patients who have not received radiotherapy and as long as the procedure is carried out by surgeons skilled in the technique.

### Inamed silicone breast implant core study results at 6 years [^a0977458]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Silicone gel-filled breast implants were developed in 1962 but did not fall under the auspices of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration until 1976 and were not classified as class III devices until 1988. This set the stage for a series of Food and Drug Administration advisory panel meetings and a moratorium on the sale of these implants from 1992 until 2006, when sufficient clinical data were presented to demonstrate their safety.

Methods

This study was conducted under the rigorous framework of a Food and Drug Administration-approved investigational device exemption to document the safety and effectiveness of Inamed silicone-filled breast implants through 10 years. Of 940 female subjects, approximately half were augmentation subjects, one-quarter were reconstruction subjects, and one-quarter were revision subjects. Follow-up visits were conducted at 0 to 4 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter. Approximately one-third of subjects also underwent biennial magnetic resonance imaging evaluation to detect silent rupture. Primary statistical analyses used the Kaplan-Meier product limit method.

Results

Data through 6 years are currently available from the 10-year study, with patient follow-up rates for that visit ranging from 78 to 92 percent per cohort. As expected, the most common local complication in all cohorts was capsular contracture, occurring in 15 to 20 percent of subjects. The by-implant rupture rate was 3.5 percent overall at 6 years. Satisfaction with implants was uniformly high throughout the study period, with 6-year rates of 95 percent for augmentation subjects and 94 percent for reconstruction subjects.

Conclusion

Study results demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of Inamed silicone-filled breast implants through 6 years, including a low rupture rate and high satisfaction rate.

### Anatomical and round breast implants: how to select and indications for use [^d697b0c4]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Choosing between round and anatomical form-stable implants is a key decision in the process of breast augmentation. Anatomical devices have been subject to a number of misconceptions that have limited their use. However, in optimal clinical practice, the benefits and risks of both anatomical and round implants should be considered for any given patient. Patient and surgeon education is fundamental in ensuring that misunderstandings are addressed. The choice between anatomical and round devices should be based on a combination of patient desires, anatomy, and surgical history. This report presents experience-based recommendations on indications and contraindications for each type, and a proposed algorithm for decision making in clinical practice.
