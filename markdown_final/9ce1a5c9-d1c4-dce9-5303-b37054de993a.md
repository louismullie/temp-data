## Question

A patient presents with chronic nonhealing nodules and draining sinus tracts on the forearm after a cosmetic skin procedure; biopsy and culture grow a rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacterium. What ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing a chronic nonhealing forearm infection with nodules and draining sinus tracts, confirmed by biopsy and culture to be a rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacterial infection following a cosmetic procedure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct ICD-10-CM category for nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. Then, I should verify whether the clinical details justify a specific cutaneous code versus a generic NTM code. Next, I will check whether the anatomic site and procedure-related context require additional specificity. Finally, I will confirm whether any external cause or procedure codes are indicated and ensure the code aligns with payer and documentation requirements.

> Let me first confirm the ICD-10-CM category. Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections are coded under A31, with subcategories for pulmonary disease, cutaneous disease, and other or unspecified forms, so A31 is the correct parent category for this case [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the most specific subcategory. The presentation of chronic nonhealing nodules with draining sinus tracts on the forearm after a cosmetic procedure is a classic cutaneous NTM infection, and the organism is a rapidly growing species such as M. abscessus, M. chelonae, or M. fortuitum, which are well-described causes of post-procedural skin and soft tissue infections. This maps to A31.1 for cutaneous nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, which is more specific than A31.8 or A31.9 and should be preferred when supported by clinical and microbiologic data [^7ea93df1] [^8977f258] [^63427911].

> Hold on, I should verify whether the anatomic site changes the code. ICD-10-CM A31.1 covers cutaneous NTM infection regardless of specific body site, so the forearm location does not require a different diagnosis code. If laterality is clinically relevant for documentation, it can be captured in the medical record, but it does not alter the ICD-10-CM code selection for A31.1 [^notfound].

> I need to check whether an external cause code is warranted. The vignette notes the infection followed a cosmetic skin procedure, which implies a healthcare-associated exposure. However, ICD-10-CM external cause codes are optional for billing in many settings and are not required to report the diagnosis itself. If the facility or payer requires external cause coding for quality or epidemiologic purposes, codes like Y95 (nosocomial condition) or procedure-related external cause codes could be considered, but they are not mandatory for diagnosis billing and should be added only when specifically indicated by local policy or the encounter type [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider the species-level detail. Although the culture grew a rapidly growing NTM, ICD-10-CM does not provide species-specific codes for cutaneous NTM beyond A31.1, so I should not attempt to force a more granular species code that does not exist in the classification. Documenting the species name in the record is appropriate for clinical care, but it will not change the billing code [^notfound].

> Final answer: I should confirm the code as A31.1 for cutaneous nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, which is the most specific and accurate ICD-10-CM diagnosis code for this presentation based on the provided clinical and microbiologic information [^notfound].

---

The correct ICD-10-CM code for chronic nonhealing nodules with draining sinus tracts on the forearm due to rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacteria following a cosmetic procedure is **A31.1** (cutaneous mycobacterial infection). This code applies to rapidly growing species such as M. abscessus, M. chelonae, or M. fortuitum [^7ea93df1] and is supported by the clinical context of cosmetic procedure–associated infections [^8977f258] [^5eb2cdc6]. If the specific organism is known, consider adding the organism name in the record, but **A31.1 remains the billable diagnosis code**.

---

## Clinical context and epidemiology

Rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacteria (RG-NTM) — M. abscessus, M. chelonae, and M. fortuitum — are environmental organisms that cause skin and soft tissue infections, particularly after cosmetic procedures such as mesotherapy, liposuction, or injections [^8977f258] [^7ea93df1]. These infections typically present as chronic, nonhealing nodules or abscesses with draining sinus tracts and are often misdiagnosed initially, leading to delayed appropriate therapy [^8977f258] [^63427911].

---

## ICD-10-CM coding considerations

The ICD-10-CM code **A31.1** specifically denotes cutaneous mycobacterial infection, which accurately reflects the clinical scenario of RG-NTM infection of the skin and soft tissues. This code encompasses infections caused by rapidly growing mycobacterial species, including M. abscessus, M. chelonae, and M. fortuitum [^notfound].

---

## Rationale for selecting A31.1

- **Specificity**: A31.1 is the most specific ICD-10-CM code for cutaneous mycobacterial infections, aligning with the clinical presentation of chronic nodules and draining sinus tracts caused by RG-NTM.
- **Clinical relevance**: The code acknowledges the pathogen's association with cosmetic procedures and healthcare-associated exposures, which is crucial for epidemiological tracking and clinical management [^8977f258] [^5eb2cdc6].
- **Documentation support**: The clinical documentation of chronic nonhealing nodules, draining sinus tracts, and culture confirmation of RG-NTM provides strong support for the use of A31.1.

---

## Alternative ICD-10-CM codes considered

While A31.1 is the most appropriate code, **alternative codes** may be considered if additional clinical context is present:

| **ICD-10-cm code** | **Description** | **Relevance to clinical scenario** |
|-|-|-|
| A31.0 | Pulmonary mycobacterial infection | Not applicable; infection is cutaneous, not pulmonary [^notfound] |
| A31.2 | Disseminated mycobacterial infection | Not applicable; no evidence of disseminated disease [^notfound] |
| A31.8 | Other mycobacterial infections | Less specific; does not capture cutaneous involvement [^notfound] |
| A31.9 | Mycobacterial infection, unspecified | Less specific; does not capture cutaneous involvement [^notfound] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate ICD-10-CM code for chronic nonhealing nodules with draining sinus tracts on the forearm due to rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacteria following a cosmetic procedure is **A31.1** (cutaneous mycobacterial infection). This code accurately reflects the clinical presentation, supports appropriate clinical management, and aligns with epidemiological considerations.

### Diagnostics, management and outcomes of pediatric nontuberculous mycobacterial infections: a 12-year retrospective study [^eabaad8f]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Clinical features may mimic malignancy, and although prognosis is favorable, treatment is often prolonged and may result in cosmetic sequelae.

Methods

We described the clinical characteristics, management and treatment outcomes of children diagnosed with NTM infections in the Central Denmark Region between 2011 and 2023. Children were identified using mycobacteriologic data and ICD-10 diagnostic codes. Detailed clinical information was extracted from hospital records, and descriptive analyses were performed.

Results

Eighty children were included, corresponding to annual incidence rates of 0.7–3.3 per 100,000. The median age at presentation was 2 years, and 55% were female. Lymphadenitis was the most common presentation (92.5%), and fever was reported in 28% of cases. Mycobacterium avium was the predominant species (78.8%). Management strategies varied considerably: 47% of the children received no treatment, and both surgical and antibiotic interventions declined over time. Despite favorable clinical outcomes, cosmetic sequelae were common, including scarring (76%), residual discoloration (30%), fistulation or suppuration (12%). The median hospital admission was 2 days, and the median in-hospital follow-up was 236.5 days.

Conclusions

The incidence of pediatric NTM infections remained stable, but the clinical burden was considerable due to prolonged disease course and frequent cosmetic sequelae. Management practices varied widely, with decreasing use of active interventions over time. The apparent lack of consensus on treatment further emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and the development of evidence-based guidelines to standardize care and improve outcomes.

### Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections after cosmetic procedures: a systematic review and management algorithm [^8977f258]. Dermatologic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) infection following cosmetic procedures usually results from inadequate sterile techniques and contamination from nonsterile water. These infections are difficult to diagnose and treat.

Objective

This study aimed to describe the characteristics of NTM infections acquired after an aesthetic procedure, identify high-risk patients and high-risk cosmetic procedures, and provide a diagnostic and management algorithm for NTM infections occurring after cosmetic procedures.

Methods

On December 20, 2017 an online search of the Medline database was done. All articles describing NTM infection in cosmetic procedures were included in this review.

Results

In total, 92 patients with a mean age of 38.35 years were included in this review. Cosmetic procedures performed in the Dominican Republic were the most common source of infection and were noted in 33 patients. The procedure that resulted in the highest proportion of the infections was mesotherapy (34%). In most of the cases, the diagnosis was missed at the initial presentation and a short course of inadequate antibiotics was unsuccessful.

Conclusion

Nontuberculous mycobacterium infections are hard to diagnose and difficult to treat, sometimes leading to severe irreversible sequalae. Aesthetic practitioners should know when to suspect and how to prevent, diagnose, and treat NTM infections.

### Nontuberculous mycobacteria: skin and soft tissue infections [^7ea93df1]. Dermatologic Clinics (2015). Low credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria are increasing in incidence. The nontuberculous mycobacteria are environmental, acid-fast bacilli that cause cutaneous infections primarily after trauma, surgery and cosmetic procedures. Skin findings include abscesses, sporotrichoid nodules or ulcers, but also less distinctive signs. Important species include Mycobacterium marinum and the rapidly growing mycobacterium: M. fortuitum, M. abscessus and M. chelonae. Obtaining tissue for mycobacterial culture and histopathology aids diagnosis. Optimal therapy is not well-established, but is species-dependent and generally dictated by susceptibility studies. Management often includes use of multiple antibiotics for several months and potential use of adjunctive surgery.

Introduction

In recent years, cosmetic procedures have gained significant popularity. By 2023, a 41.3% increase in cosmetic surgeries was reported over the previous 4 years, with liposuction and botulinic toxin injections being the most frequently performed procedures. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are acid-fast bacilli that differ from tuberculous mycobacteria in several aspects, including growth rate, temperature sensitivity, nutritional requirements, enzymatic activity, and resistance to antituberculous drugs.

Clinical manifestations may vary, which makes diagnosis challenging and can delay appropriate treatment. Management typically involves a combination of macrolides and 1 or 2 additional antibiotics, depending on the extent of the infection and culture results; however, no clear clinical practice guidelines have been established. Furthermore, there are few reported cases of cutaneous NTM infections in Latin America, suggesting that the disease may be underdiagnosed and underestimated.

The following study is a case series of 7 patients without comorbidities who attended the outpatient service at Hospital Regional Docente in Trujillo, Peru. These patients presented with skin lesions following cosmetic procedures (Table I), from 2023 up to the date of consultation.

In August 2013, the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene was notified of two persons with rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacterial surgical-site infections. Both patients had undergone surgical procedures as medical tourists at the same private surgical clinic in the Dominican Republic the previous month. Within 7 days of returning to the United States, both sought care for symptoms that included surgical wound abscesses, clear fluid drainage, pain, and fever. Initial antibiotic therapy was ineffective. Material collected from both patients' wounds grew. Mycobacterium abscessus exhibiting a high degree of antibiotic resistance characteristic of this organism. Official health alerts from state and local health departments and notifications through the Emerging Infections Network and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons requested that health-care providers and the public health community report additional patients.

A probable case was defined as a soft-tissue infection unresponsive to standard antibiotic therapy in a patient who had undergone cosmetic surgery in the Dominican Republic after March 1, 2013. A confirmed case was defined as a probable case testing positive for RG-NTM. Patients with probable and confirmed infection were interviewed by using a standardized questionnaire; a systematic abstraction of patients' medical records is ongoing. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of available isolates from patients associated with clinic A is being performed at CDC and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. As of February 21, 2014, a total of 19 cases were identified from five states. Sixteen cases were confirmed, and three were probable. All patients are female.

Twelve reported undergoing surgery at clinic A, and seven reported surgery at seven other Dominican Republic surgical clinics. The most common cosmetic surgical procedures were liposuction, abdominoplasty, and breast implantation; all procedures occurred during March–November 2013, and illness onsets occurred during April–November 2013. Fourteen were hospitalized in the United States and required multiple therapeutic and corrective surgical procedures and long courses of antibiotics; five were treated as outpatients. No deaths were reported. Of the 16 confirmed cases, 13 were Mycobacterium abscessus infections; two were M. fortuitum infections; and one is pending final speciation. Of the 18 patients who were interviewed, 13 were born in the Dominican Republic.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

Introduction

Mycobacterium abscessus is a species of intrinsically multidrug–resistant, rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) known to cause health care–associated infections and implicated in skin and soft tissue infections after cosmetic surgical procedures. On February 7, 2023, CDC notified the Florida Department of Health (FDOH) of a non-Florida resident with NTM infection after a cosmetic procedure at a surgery clinic (clinic A) in south Florida. FDOH and CDC issued national Epidemic Information Exchange (Epi-X) notices in March 2023 to identify additional infections. During the ensuing investigation in March 2023, FDOH identified a total of 15 NTM infections in patients who underwent surgical procedures by a plastic surgeon in solo practice at clinic A, an alternative practice location that was used during renovation of the permanent facility (clinic B).

Discussion

NTM infections have become a public health concern, making their diagnosis and proper treatment fundamentally important. Cutaneous NTM infection should be suspected in patients presenting with nodules and abscesses following cosmetic procedures, especially when there is no response to conventional antibacterial therapy. Rapid-growing mycobacteria typically associated with such cosmetic procedures include M. abscessus, M. fortuitum, and M. chelonae.

Increase in the frequency of cosmetic procedures performed by both medical and nonmedical professionals has led to a decrease in quality standards and a neglect of basic aseptic requirements. Cosmetic procedures most commonly associated with cutaneous NTM infections include mesotherapy, dermal fillers, breast reconstruction, liposuction, CO 2 laser resurfacing, body piercings, and tattoos. Other procedures, such as Mohs micrographic surgery and punch biopsies, have been highly implicated in the development of these infections as well. The procedures reported in this study included both surgical and nonsurgical interventions, performed by medical and nonmedical practitioners.

The clinical presentation is variable and depends on factors such as the duration of illness, the causative agent, and the patient's immunologic status. Differential diagnoses include cutaneous tuberculosis, sporotrichosis, among others. Common clinical findings include abscesses, cellulitis, sporotrichoid nodules, ulcers, panniculitis, folliculitis, papules, and plaques with long-standing evolution, often accompanied by localized pain and possible fistula formation. Abscesses and nodules are the most frequent lesions observed in infections caused by M. abscessus, which were also the predominant findings in the patients described in this study.

Microbial diagnosis is established through the isolation of the acid-fast bacilli using ZN staining, culture of skin tissue and/or drainage secretions, histopathological analysis and PCR. The gold standard remains culture, although it often requires prolonged incubation periods. In this study, NTM was isolated only through culture in 3 patients.

Investigation and Outcomes

Case Definition

A case was defined as the isolation of M. abscessus from a wound culture obtained from a patient who underwent a cosmetic procedure at clinic A during August–December 2022. Among 19 reported infections, a total of 15 patients (including the index patient) from nine U.S. states met the case definition (Table). The other four patients experienced signs and symptoms of postsurgical infection but lacked confirmatory laboratory results and were not included in the analysis. This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. *

TABLE
Demographic and epidemiologic characteristics of patients with nontuberculous mycobacteria infections after receiving cosmetic surgery at clinic A (N = 15) — Florida, 2022–2023

* Patients might have had multiple procedures at the time of surgery; therefore, the total number of procedures exceeds the total number of patients.

† Including computerized tomography–guided percutaneous abscess drainage, needle aspiration, incision and drainage, wound debridement, and surgical skin excision with drainage.

§ Data obtained from available records.

Characteristics of Cases

All patients were women, and the median age was 33 years (range = 24–51 years). The median interval from the procedure to symptom onset was 69 days (range = 33–119 days). Patients reported swelling, purulent drainage, redness, or pain at surgical sites. Pharmaceutical treatments for M. abscessus included oral and intravenous antibiotics with prolonged courses up to 2–6 months. In addition to prescribing medication, health care providers performed incision, drainage, and debridement. (Table). Seven patients' wound isolates were available for analysis by the Florida Bureau of Public Health Laboratories. Whole genome sequencing determined that four isolates were closely related †. Clinic A was closed after identification of the cluster; the closure precluded environmental sampling during the investigation.

On-site Assessment

On March 3, 2023, FDOH conducted an on-site infection control assessment at clinic B, which operated with the same surgeon, staff members, and protocols as did clinic A. The assessment detected gaps in environmental cleaning practices, use of proper personal protective equipment, and disinfection during surgical device reprocessing.

### Mycobacterium mucogenicum infection following a cosmetic procedure with poly-L-lactic acid [^c55b8b7e]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The emphasis on the preservation of youth is ever apparent as new antiaging products, cosmetic procedures, and advertising campaigns aim to address new ways to prevent the natural aging process. Many individuals prefer noninvasive surgical procedures involving minimal downtime and a speedy recovery. Although these cosmetic procedures are considered minor, complications do arise and infections can occur. While many species of bacteria can cause these infections, one such species that is usually over looked and can cause these infections are the atypical mycobacteria. Early diagnosis is important, as these infections can rapidly progress into more serious skin manifestations. We present a 31-year-old female with a 3-month history of a nonhealing ulcer on her cheek that started approximately 2 weeks following a cosmetic procedure with an injectable filler. This patient represents an uncommon complication that may occur in patients subjected to multiple facial injections, as their susceptibility to infection and secondary biofilm formation increases with their current and future injections. This case review highlights the growing number of cosmetic procedures in our society, the most common complications of these treatments, an emerging complication concerning the formation of biofilms, as well as a review of the literature on atypical mycobacteria infections.

### Notes from the field: rapidly growing nontuberculous Mycobacterium wound infections among medical tourists undergoing cosmetic surgeries in the Dominican Republic – multiple states, March 2013-February 2014 [^e199c9d2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

As of February 21, 2014, a total of 19 cases were identified from five states (New York, 11; Massachusetts, three; Connecticut, two; Maryland, two; and Pennsylvania, one). Sixteen (84%) cases were confirmed, and three (16%) were probable. All patients are female (aged 18–59 years). Twelve (63%) reported undergoing surgery at clinic A, and seven (37%) reported surgery at seven other Dominican Republic surgical clinics. The most common cosmetic surgical procedures were liposuction (74%), abdominoplasty (58%), and breast implantation (32%); all procedures occurred during March–November 2013 (Figure), and illness onsets occurred during April–November 2013. Fourteen (74%) were hospitalized in the United States and required multiple therapeutic and corrective surgical procedures and long courses of antibiotics; five were treated as outpatients. No deaths were reported. Of the 16 confirmed cases, 13 (81%) were Mycobacterium abscessus infections; two (12%) were M. fortuitum infections; and one (6%) is pending final speciation. Of the 18 patients who were interviewed, 13 (72%) were born in the Dominican Republic.

CDC notified Dominican public health authorities of the outbreak investigation and recommended patient follow-up and onsite assessment of infection control practices at the implicated clinics. Clinic A has been closed temporarily by Dominican authorities. This and other outbreaks underscore the risk for infection, including RG-NTM infection, resulting from medical tourism. CDC advises all persons planning to receive surgical care outside the United States to verify that the health-care provider and facility they are considering using are licensed and accredited by an internationally recognized accreditation organization before proceeding. These findings indicate that health-care providers consider RG-NTM among patients with a history of cosmetic surgery in the Dominican Republic who also have a surgical-site infection that fails to respond to standard therapy.

Exposure to tuberculosis (TB) in healthcare settings can pose a significant risk to patients, families, and healthcare personnel. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that healthcare facilities perform an annual risk assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of current TB infection control measures but do not offer methods to encompass larger healthcare systems with geographically diverse facilities. We sought to develop a supplemental risk assessment strategy utilizing ICD-10-CM codes to further quantify TB risk for individual sites across our healthcare system.

Learning points

Mycobacterium cosmeticum, a rapidly growing non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM), that was initially described to cause skin and soft tissue infection, can be a cause of lung infection.
Although relatively rare, NTM lung infection should be suspected and investigated in immunocompromised patients who do not improve on initial empiric therapy.
Rapidly growing mycobacteria form colonies within 7 days of incubation in solid culture media.
Clinical and microbiologic diagnostic criteria have to be fulfilled to diagnose NTM lung disease.
More research is needed regarding the clinical use of culture-independent techniques in respiratory infections to improve the diagnostic yield, especially in critically ill patients.
Improved basic science understanding is needed to better identify factors that cause NTM infections to be pathogenic in some patients.

Materials and Methods

Data Sources

We used 2 data sources to include reported cases of NTM infections associated with surgical, medical, or aesthetic procedures during January 2012‒June 2020. The first data source was the national early warning response system (EWRS) for HAI diagnosed in HCF, using an electronic reporting process implemented in 2012 (e-SIN), and slightly modified in 2017. The second data source was the NTM isolate database of the CNR-MyRMA, which includes microbiological results of clinical isolates, as well as environmental isolates found after epidemiologic investigations. The Regional Support Centre for the Prevention of Healthcare-Associated Infections conducted epidemiologic investigations. We contacted health professionals who reported cases to the national EWRS for HAI and send isolates to CNR-MyRMA to associate isolates with cases. We used this procedure to set up a single database containing epidemiologic and microbiological data.

Case Definition

We included extrapulmonary NTM infections defined as a person who had clinical symptoms compatible with an NTM infection and > 1 NTM-positive microbiological sample (cases considered as NTM colonization by physicians were excluded); and specific surgical, medical, or aesthetic procedures, including cosmetic care, potentially at the origin of the NTM infection. Pulmonary NTM infections, even hospital-acquired, were excluded. We usually consolidated epidemiologically related cases into a single report.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected the following information from the 2 data sources: 1) the report itself (the HCF or the laboratory which made the report, date of report); 2) data for infection (date of onset of initial symptoms, symptoms, infection type); 3) the context and suspected cause of the infection (procedure at the origin of the infection, date of contamination or invasive procedure, equipment implicated); 4) epidemic context (number of cases, distribution over time); 5) characteristics of case-patients (age, sex, and immune status); 6) investigation characteristics performed after the NTM infection diagnosis (environmental and professional practices investigations, corrective measures implemented); and 7) microbiological results (name of species and subspecies, whole-genome sequencing [WGS] comparison). We performed a descriptive data analysis by using STATA version 14.2. We analyzed the rate of NTM infection cases over the study period by using a Poisson regression model.

Soft-Tissue Infections

Diagnosis

Proper identification of NTM in skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) is crucial for treatment success in orthopaedics. SSTIs caused by NTM often occur after skin-breaching trauma (traumatic injury, surgery, or cosmetic procedures), and this was demonstrated in a study by Goldstein et alwhere 14 patients with NTM SSTIs were all found to have undergone a previous procedure at the site of infection. SSTIs from NTM typically present in a nonspecific fashion, which are diverse, including abscesses, cellulitis, nodules, ulcers, draining sinus tracts, plaques, folliculitis, and others. The identification of a SSTI could also be as a consequence of disseminated NTM disease, particularly in immunosuppressed patients.

An indolent SSTI that is culture negative and unresponsive to typical antimicrobials should also raise concern for NTM. The relative rarity of NTM, the fact that mycobacterial cultures are not routinely performed on cultures, and the nonspecific nature of its presentation can all lead to delays in diagnosis, which is why a high clinical suspicion must be maintained. In addition, because treatment varies based on the specific NTM species and their sensitivities, NTM-specific cultures from tissue biopsies are essential for accurate diagnosis.

Histologic analysis of NTM tissue biopsies frequently shows negative results with acid-fast bacilli stains and cannot preclude the possibility of NTM infections. However, suppurative granulomas are one of the most characteristic histologic features of biopsy specimens and should trigger suspicion for cutaneous NTM. Occasionally, positive cultures occur in the absence of clinical disease, which may be attributed to laboratory cross-contamination or contaminated instruments, especially those with small crevices that can be difficult to sterilize. If NTM are identified in normally sterile sites, in large quantities, or there are multiple isolates from nonsterile sites, then surgeons should consider this as a true infection until proven otherwise and urgent consultation with ID specialists should be done for consideration of therapy, especially in immunocompromised patients.

### Skin and soft tissue infections due to rapidly growing mycobacteria… [^63427911]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

© 2024 Objective To compare the demographics, clinical features, susceptibility patterns, and treatment for skin and soft tissue infections due to Mycobacterium fortuitum and Mycobacterium chelonae or Mycobacterium abscessus. Design Retrospective medical record review. Setting Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn. Results The medical records of 63 patients with skin or soft tissue infections due to rapidly growing mycobacteria were reviewed. Patients with M chelonae or M abscessus were older and more likely to be taking immunosuppressive medications than patients with M fortuitum. Mycobacterium fortuitum tended to manifest as a single lesion, while most M chelonae or M abscessus manifested as multiple lesions. More patients with M fortuitum had a prior invasive surgical procedure at the infected site.

These organisms are characterized by rapid growth on standard media and by lack of pigmentation. 1 Clinical manifestations include localized abscess formation and chronic ulcers. 1, 2 Disseminated infections, especially in immunocompromised hosts, have been widely described. 1, 3, 4 There are multiple reports of infection after trauma and surgical. or other procedures, including acupuncture, 5 liposuction, 6–8 silicone injection, 9 breast implantation, 10–12 intravenous catheter use, 13 dermatologic surgery, 14, 15 pedicures, 16–18 exposure to prosthetic material, 19 pacemaker placement, 20 and subcutaneous injections. 21–25 Pulmonary disease due to M fortuitum has been described following hot tub use.
26. Information was collected regarding demographics, immune status, infection characteristics, site and clinical description of the lesions, antimicrobial therapy, surgical procedures, and outcome.

Definite infection was defined as culture positivity in the presence of a compatible clinical syndrome, such as chronic ulcers, wound drainage, or abscess. Patients with isolated single colonies in their cultures, in the absence of a compatible clinical syndrome, were excluded from the analysis. There were significant differences noted between patients with M fortuitum and M chelonae or M abscessus in their mean age, use of immunosuppressive medications at the time of infection, and history of an invasive procedure at the site of diagnosis, as well as in the presence of systemic comorbidities. Given the retrospective nature of the study and the reliance on medical records for clinical information, detailed descriptions of lesions were often unavailable.

Reported skin findings varied widely, including sinus tracts, nonhealing ulcers, subcutaneous abscesses, subcutaneous fluctuant or firm nodules of varying size, and erythema in association with ulcers or chronic drainage from prior surgical wounds. Specific descriptions of skin color were not typically documented, although several patients' nodules were described as "violaceous. " Only 2 patients had culture-proved pulmonary coinfection. Forty-five patients were treated with antimicrobial agents. Of the remaining 18 patients, 9 were treated with surgery alone. Fourteen patients received parenteral antimicrobial agents, with a median duration of 25 days. Thirty-eight patients received oral antimicrobial agents, with a median duration of 127 days. Thirty-seven patients underwent surgical procedures. Patients with single lesions were more likely to undergo surgery than those with multiple lesions.

### Mortality rate and cause of death in adults with extrapulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria infection, Denmark [^42ae4123]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The significantly higher proportion of extrapulmonary NTM patients with other bacterial diseases and pneumonia could be associated with an increased likelihood of immune dysfunction. Pneumonia is also a risk factor for pulmonary NTM. However, that finding could also be because of misdiagnoses and erroneous use of diagnostic codes.

This study was based on national registers, and the data entered in those registers imply an inherent risk for underreporting, overreporting, and misclassification. Treatment of extrapulmonary NTM disease is centralized in 6 hospitals in Denmark with specialized centers for mycobacterial diseases, and we are confident that the diagnoses have a high rate of accuracy. Previous validations of diagnostic codes in our registers have shown a high positive predictive value. The ICD-10 codes pertaining to extrapulmonary NTM manifestation and species are only specific for skin infections with M. marinum and M. ulcerans, and the registers used in this study do not contain data on microbiology or all relevant risk factors (e.g. type of immunosuppressants). This factor limited our ability to precisely describe the type, localization, and pathogenicity of NTM infections, including species. Nevertheless, the percentage of extrapulmonary NTM skin infections in our study (29.7%) is comparable to those in a US culture-based study (32%). We assume that using ICD-10 codes for extrapulmonary NTM disease correlates well with clinically relevant disease compared with relying on microbiologic data alone. Furthermore, the inclusion of M. ulcerans patients could be debated, because M. ulcerans might not be considered as a separate disease entity, although it is genetically very similar to M. marinum.

Data on the causes of death are registered by the physician who verifies the death. However, those physicians might not be familiar with the patient's entire medical history or with complex infections, making it difficult to differentiate between causes of death in this comorbid population. The low number of autopsies conducted in Denmark calls into question the validity of the death certificates; however, that issue appears to be common in other settings.

In conclusion, patients with extrapulmonary NTM infection have a significantly higher burden of comorbidities than do matched controls. The mortality rate remained higher for persons with extrapulmonary NTM infection than for matched controls after adjusting for a comorbidity severity index. In addition, patients with extrapulmonary NTM disease often die from underlying comorbidities, such as hematologic malignancies and HIV, not from extrapulmonary NTM disease.

### Clinically refined epidemiology of nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease in south Korea: overestimation when relying only on diagnostic codes [^d5d79db9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

HIRA big data

Korea has an NHI that covers 98% of the total population, numbering approximately 50 million as of 2014. HIRA big data are generated while reimbursing health care providers under the NHI, which is an obligation for all medical institutes. The data include comprehensive information about age, gender, diagnosis, hospitalization, outpatient service, procedures, surgeries, examination, treatment, prescriptions, and cost. The database has been accessible to all researchers since 2009.

Study population

Patients with a diagnostic code of NTM (A31, infection due to other mycobacteria) according to the International Classification of Disease-Tenth Revision (ICD-10) coding system were retrospectively identified between January 1st, 2007, and June 30th, 2019 from the HIRA main database. The relevant information was extracted from secondary accessible research data. This study used research data (M20200229346) from the HIRA database. The views expressed are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the HIRA and the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW).

Definition of NTM-PD

Diagnostic code-based NTM-PD patients were defined as patients who had NTM (ICD-10: A31) as a primary or secondary diagnosis on at least 2 occasions within 180 days. Cutaneous mycobacterial infection (ICD-10: A31.1) was excluded as a diagnosis of NTM. The Korean Classification of Diseases (KCD), similar to ICD-10, did not include disseminated Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (ICD-10: A31.2); thus, excluding this condition was not required. The first year, 2007, was used as a washout period, and patients from 2008 to 2018 were analyzed. The incidence and prevalence were calculated for the population according to sex and age groups with data from the Ministry of the Interior and Safety. Clinically refined NTM-PD patients were excluded from diagnostic code-based NTM-PD patients diagnosed at medical institutions with an implementation rate of less than 5% of diagnosis-related AFB cultures. For a comprehensive patient definition, clinically refined NTM-PD patients were identified by excluding medical institutions with low AFB culture rates and then reanalyzing the data according to the criteria for diagnostic code-based NTM-PD patients.

### Association of healthcare and aesthetic procedures with infections caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria, France, 2012 ‒ 2020 [^3363ec5f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

For most (69%, 59/85) of cases, the infection was acquired inside the HCF, whereas 26 cases (31%) were acquired outside the reporting HCF. These infections acquired outside the HCF were imported either from another HCF (n = 14) or from a non–hospital-based medical or aesthetic practice (n = 12).

More women than men had cases reported (M:F = 31:46); sex was not reported for 8 case-patients. The median case age was 54 years (range 4–86 years; age was not reported for 12 cases). One third of the cases concerned immunosuppressed patients (33%, 23/70 cases; 15 cases did not report this information). NTM infections resulted from surgical procedures (56%, 48/85 cases), other invasive procedures (33%, 28/85 cases), and noninvasive procedures (11%, 9/85 cases). Cardiovascular surgery (n = 14), orthopedic surgery (n = 11), plastic surgery (e.g. breast surgery, (n = 13), face-lift (n = 2), abdominoplasty (n = 1), or capillary implant (n = 1), and catheter-associated infections (n = 17) comprised most of the surgical and other invasive procedure cases reported. The NTM infections concerned mainly skin and soft tissues (36%, 31/85), intravascular catheters (20%, 17/85), bones and joints (18%, 15/85), and arterial/cardiac (15%, 13/85) (Table 1).

### Association of healthcare and aesthetic procedures with infections caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria, France, 2012 ‒ 2020 [^0a86fbd3]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

We describe nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infections during 2012–2020 associated with health care and aesthetic procedures in France. We obtained epidemiologic data from the national early warning response system for healtcare-associated infections and data on NTM isolates from the National Reference Center for Mycobacteria. We compared clinical and environmental isolates by using whole-genome sequencing. The 85 original cases were reported after surgery (48, 56%), other invasive procedures (28, 33%) and other procedures (9, 11%). NTM isolates belonged to rapidly growing (73, 86%) and slowly growing (10, 12%) species; in 2 cases, the species was not identified. We performed environmental investigations for 38 (45%) cases; results for 12 (32%) were positive for the same NTM species as for the infection. In 10 cases that had environmental and clinical samples whose genomes were similar, the infection source was probably the water used in the procedures. NTM infections could be preventable by using sterile water in all invasive procedures.

### Prevalence, incidence, and mortality of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection in Korea: a nationwide population-based study [^b9ddc23d]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study showed that the prevalence and incidence of NTM infection in Korea, as measured by coding data, rapidly increased in the recent two decades. The prevalence and incidence were higher in women and the elderly. Considering such increase in the aging population, the prevalence and incidence may increase further in the future. The mortality in those with NTM infection was approximately twice than that in the general population. This trend should be closely monitored to establish optimal healthcare policies and treatment strategies for NTM infection.

### Therapy of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections [^aae50916]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Mycobacterial infections are increasing in incidence worldwide, partly as a result of the increase in immunocompromised individuals. They cause a large number of cutaneous infections with a broad array of manifestations. Because of their diverse manifestations and sometimes fastidious nature, infections with mycobacteria are often misdiagnosed, leading to delay in and sometimes failure of therapy. In addition, many mycobacteria display both in vitro and in vivo drug resistance to antimicrobial agents. Early recognition of affected patients, initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy based on current guidelines, and tailoring of therapy after susceptibility testing is available are therefore essential to the successful treatment of mycobacterial infections.

### Infections due to rapidly growing mycobacteria [^3055f1fd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Rapidly growing mycobacteria, generally of low virulence, are capable of causing a wide spectrum of infections. Increasing reports in the literature, referral center experiences, and data from the Infectious Disease Society of America Emerging Infectious Disease Network suggest that greater numbers of infections are occurring. Epidemiological study is imperative in understanding the true incidence of these infections and preventing disease in vulnerable hosts. Especially problematic is pulmonary infection due to Mycobacterium abscessus, which is difficult to cure. New agents with enhanced activity against this group and other nontuberculous mycobacteria are needed. Here, we focus on the members of the rapidly growing mycobacteria because of their emerging importance in both sporadic infections and outbreak settings.

Case 3

A 34-year-old female, who received subcutaneous infiltrations with sodium bicarbonate on the posterior trunk developed painful nodules and purulent abscesses at the injection sites. She had previously undergone treatment with corticosteroids and antibiotics, without clinical improvement. On physical examination, multiple painful, fluctuant abscesses were observed on the posterior and lateral trunk (Fig 1, C). The culture was negative and the skin biopsy revealed chronic noncaseating granulomatous dermatitis. The patient was treated with clarithromycin and doxycycline, and clinical improvement was noted after 4 months. However, the patient was subsequently lost to follow-up.

Case 4

A 40-year-old female, who underwent lipoabdominoplasty and gluteal lipotransfer developed skin lesions on site at the puncture sites 4 weeks after the procedure. She had been previously treated with cephalosporin and topical corticosteroid, with no clinical improvement. On examination, erythematous nodules and purulent abscesses were noted on both gluteal regions (Fig 1, D). Microscopy revealed numerous acid-fast bacilli. Skin biopsy demonstrated a noncaseating granulomatous inflammatory infiltrate in the superficial and mid-dermis, along with microabscesses in the fibroconnective and adipose tissue. The patient was treated with clarithromycin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and showed clinical improvement following treatment.

Case 5

A 30-year-old female underwent through mesotherapy with platelet-rich plasma in the gluteal area and developed painful nodules at the injection site 3 months after the procedure. The patient had previously self-medicated with various topical antibiotics and intramuscular ceftriaxone without clinical improvement. Physical examination revealed an erythematous, indurated plaque with fluctuating areas and a draining sinus on the left gluteus (Fig 1, E). Soft tissue ultrasound showed a heterogenous fluid collection with internal echoes and a fistulous tract to the skin surface. Microscopy was positive for acid-fast bacilli and culture confirmed the presence of mycobacterium. Skin biopsy revealed granulomatous dermatitis. The patient was treated with clarithromycin, following which resulted in significant clinical improvement.

### Inclusion of latent tuberculosis infection as a separate entity into the international classification of diseases [^4e05c54b]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

The 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) proposed by the WHO is currently in the consultation phase. In common with previous versions of the ICD this revised version does not contain a code for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), contrasting with the inclusion of a large number of codes for various manifestations of active tuberculosis (TB). Inclusion of a separate code for LTBI into ICD-11 is critically important for epidemiological, clinical and research purposes. On behalf of the Paediatric Tuberculosis Network European Trials group, we encourage colleagues worldwide who are caring for TB patients or are involved in TB research to join us in supporting the case for a long overdue ICD code for LTBI.

### Cutaneousinfection presenting clinically as a mycetoma [^468d6724]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mycobacterium chelonae belongs to a group of rapidly growing mycobacteria, a subset of the ubiquitous nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) that rarely cause skin and soft–tissue infections. These infections often occur in immunosuppressed patients but may also be seen in immunocompetent hosts. Their incidence is increasing worldwide and is thought to result from a combination of more surgical and cosmetic procedures performed, the increased use of immunosuppressive medications, and an improved ability to isolate and identify these organisms. Misdiagnoses and delayed diagnoses are still common despite this increased incidence, thus making the ability to recognize unusual clinical presentations of cutaneous NTM infections increasingly important.

Case 6

A 42-year-old healthy women developed abdominal abscesses 10 days after receiving subcutaneous injections of enzymatic hyaluronidase solution. The patient had been initially treated treated with antibiotics and abscess drainage without clinical improvement. On examination, multiple nodules, erythematous plaques, fistulous tracts, and scar lesions were observed. Microscopy evaluation revealed the presence of acid-fast bacilli. Skin biopsy showed a dense inflammatory infiltrate with histocytes forming granulomas (Fig 2, A). ZN staining confirmed the presence of bacilli (Fig 2, B). The patient was treated with clarithromycin, levofloxacin, doxycycline along with surgical drainage of the lesions. However, due to gastrointestinal intolerance, the antibiotic treatment was adjusted to minocycline and clarithromycin. The patient remains under antibiotic therapy, although multiple scar lesions were noted during the latest follow-up.

Case 7

A 23-year-old female with no prior comorbidities, underwent bichectomy and mentoplasty with adipose tissue infiltration in the chin. Two weeks after the procedure, she developed skin lesions at the injection site. Initial management included drainage, antibiotic therapy but no clinical improvement observed. On physical examination, fluctuant erythematous nodules with a fistulous tract were identified in the chin region (Fig 1, F). Microscopy revealed numerous acid-fast bacilli. The culture was negative. Skin biopsy showed chronic noncaseating granulomatous dermatitis. The patient was treated with doxycycline and clarithromycin, with progressive clinical improvement documented during follow-up visits.

### Cutaneous Mycobacterium abscessus infection following hair transplant [^63fc5783]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

A 28-year-old man presented with a 10-day history of scalp nodules. He had undergone hair transplantation 2 months previously. Incision and drainage of one of the nodules yielded gelatinous material, which was sent for microscopy and culture, including low-temperature culture. After 2 weeks of incubation, culture of the nodule yielded acid- and alcohol-fast bacilli, which were identified as Mycobacterium abscessus, a rapidly growing, nontuberculous mycobacterium, which has been reported to cause cutaneous, soft tissue and respiratory infections following trauma, surgery or injection with nonsterile needles. A high index of suspicion is therefore needed in patients who present with cutaneous infections after cosmetic dermatological procedures, including hair transplantation.

Case 1

A 53-year-old female with no relevant medical history received intradermal infiltrations with dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE). Two months after the procedure, she developed nodular lesions at the injection sites on her face. She had previously received a 1-month course of antibiotics with no clinical improvement. On physical examination, erythematous nodules with central ulceration were observed in the frontal and left mandibular regions (Fig 1, A). Laboratory findings were unremarkable. Direct microscopy revealed acid-fast bacilli, and culture was positive for Mycobacterium sp. Skin biopsy demonstrated dermatitis and panniculitis with lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate and formation of granulomas. Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining showed scant bacilli, which were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as M. abscessus. The patient was treated with minocycline, clarithromycin, and drainage, resulting in resolution of lesions.

### Extrapulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria infections in hospitalized patients, United States, 2009–2014 [^9af40d88]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) cause pulmonary and extrapulmonary infections in susceptible persons. To characterize the epidemiology of skin and soft tissue (SST) and disseminated extrapulmonary infections caused by NTM in the United States, we used a large electronic health record database to examine clinical, demographic, and laboratory data for hospitalized patients with NTM isolated from extrapulmonary sources during 2009–2014. Using all unique inpatients as the denominator, we estimated prevalence and summarized cases by key characteristics. Of 9,196,147 inpatients, 831 had confirmed extrapulmonary NTM. The 6-year prevalence was 11 cases/100,000 inpatients; source-specific prevalence was 4.4 SST infections/100,000 inpatients and 3.7 disseminated infections/100,000 inpatients. NTM species varied across geographic region; rapidly growing NTM were most prevalent in southern states. Infection with Mycobacterium avium complex was more common among patients with concurrent HIV and fungal infection, a relevant finding because treatment is more effective for M. avium complex than for other NTM infections.

### Cutaneous infections due to nontuberculosis Mycobacterium: recognition and management [^10cc2a66]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are a diverse group of organisms that are ubiquitous in the environment, and the incidence of cutaneous infections due to NTM has been steadily increasing. Cutaneous infections due to NTM can be difficult to diagnose, due to their wide spectrum of clinical presentations and histopathological findings that are often nonspecific. A variety of modalities including tissue culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays may be necessary to identify the organism. Treatment can also be challenging, as it can depend on multiple factors, including the causative organism, the patient's immunological status, and the extent of disease involvement. In this review, we discuss the common presentations of cutaneous NTM infections, diagnostic tools, and treatment recommendations. A multi-disciplinary approach that involves good communication between the clinician, the histopathologist, the microbiologist, and infectious disease specialists can help lead to successful diagnosis and management.

### Skin and soft tissue nontuberculous mycobacteria infection: a retrospective case series of 49 patients [^3a9ab4cb]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The incidence of skin and soft tissue nontuberculous mycobacteria infection (SSTNI) is increasing. But it may be challenging to diagnose and treat SSTNI.

Objective

To summarize course, clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of SSTNI and discuss the association between SSTNI and procedures.

Methods

A retrospective case series study was conducted among patients diagnosed with SSTNI after surgical procedures. Medical history was collected, disease course and characteristics were analyzed.

Results

49 patients were collected. Among them, 39 (80%) patients were infected with Mycobacterium abscesses. 40 (82%) patients had a history of fat-related procedures. The median and interquartile range of onset time were 15 and 43 days (1–100). Time from first visit to diagnosis was 82 ± 57 days (23–308). Wound healing time was 161 ± 92 days (30–545). The most common symptom were redness (96%), followed by swelling (96%), abscess (84%), pain (80%) and induration (76%). The most common infected site were head and neck (56%), followed by breasts (20%). 6 (12.5%) patients were diagnosed clearly before admission to our department. 10 (28%) patients showed positive acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smears among 36 patients. Treatment included debridement surgeries, drainage and antibiotics.

Conclusion

Patient with the above symptoms should be considered as SSTNI. Results of AFB smears are frequently negative after empirical antibiotic treatment so that molecular diagnostic techniques are required for rapid and accurate identification. Debridement surgeries, drainage and sensitive antibiotics are effective. Drug safety and psychological status should be paid attention.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^f036689c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) — Although most infections occur after primary inoculation at sites of skin disruption or trauma, hematogenous dissemination does occur; in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients the most common manifestations include cutaneous and pleuropulmonary disease, and in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients catheter-related infection and bacteremia are noted. Disseminated infection with Mycobacterium avium complex occurs preferentially among patients with HIV disease, whereas bloodstream and cutaneous infections with multiple NTM species are more frequent among non-HIV-immunocompromised hosts; dermatologic manifestations include a poorly resolving cellulitis, painless 1- to 2-cm nodules, necrotic ulcers, and subcutaneous abscesses. Treatment requires prolonged combination therapy (duration, 6–12 weeks) that should consist of a macrolide antibiotic (eg, clarithromycin) and a second agent to which the isolate is susceptible, and surgical debridement is crucial for cultures and sensitivities and to promote skin and soft tissue healing.

### Prevalence of nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease, Germany, 2009–2014 [^f4fd627d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are a biologically diverse group of microorganisms that may cause progressive NTM pulmonary disease (NTM-PD), particularly in persons who have risk factors such as advanced age or chronic airway diseases. However, population-based data on the epidemiology of NTM-PD are scarce, particularly in Europe. We used hospital discharge codes from the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10), as a surrogate to demonstrate that NTM-PD prevalence is steadily increasing in Germany, as is the case in many other countries. However, we assumed that most patients with this chronic infection are managed in outpatient care. The objective of this population-based study was to estimate the annual overall prevalence rates of NTM-PD in Germany over a 6-year period and to analyze the distribution of age and sex, the site of healthcare provision, and concomitant conditions, using a representative sample of routine statutory health insurance claims data.

### Cutaneous non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections in the outpatient setting: presentation of a case, review of the literature, and therapeutic considerations [^d5695a22]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Mycobacterial infections are not common issues for many dermatologists. Recognition and treatment of these infections are frequently delayed by incorrect diagnoses. Frequently, the diagnosis of a mycobacterial infection is hampered by coinfection with bacteria including Staphylococcus. In some instances, patients will have infections with both mycobacteria and Staphylococcus. For some patients, as was the case with the patient reported herein, a biopsy is required to establish an accurate diagnosis. Physicians need to keep an open mind when presented with cutaneous infections and consider mycobacterial infections for patients that do not improve with standard antibacterial medications.

The median duration of antimicrobial chemotherapy was 14 months (range 2–39 months). Among the 7 patients with rapidly growing NTM, the median duration was 6 months. The median duration was longer in patients with slow-growing NTM, at 14 months. Twelve patients received injectable antimicrobial drugs as part of their treatment regimen, whereas 2 patients had oral therapy alone. The median duration of therapy with injectable agents was 5 months; rapidly growing strains were treated for a median of 6 months and slow-growing strains for a median of 5 months. The median duration of antimicrobial drug therapy after definitive surgery was 2 months. Patients infected with slow-growing NTM received a more protracted course of postoperative antimicrobial therapy, with a median duration of 5 months, compared with < 1 month in patients infected with rapidly growing strains.

Outcomes

During the follow-up period after surgical intervention (median duration 20 months, range 1–60 months), 13/14 patients did not develop clinical or microbiological relapse and were cured. One (case-patient 7) had clinical and microbiological relapse and was deemed to have failed treatment; the first relapse occurred 2 months after the first surgery to control the infection. The relapse, a disseminated infection distant from the original surgical site, was a likely result of the patient receiving multiple immunosuppressive medications to control systemic lupus erythematosus. She required 12 surgical procedures within the first year and subsequently required ≈1 procedure/year for control of chronic disseminated infection over the next 3 years, primarily in the form of debridement and excision of soft tissue mass. Of note, this patient chose to forgo antimicrobial therapy after the first 4 months of treatment because of intolerable side effects from multiple medications. Two instances of microbiologic relapse were documented for this patient.

### Prevalence, incidence, and mortality of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection in Korea: a nationwide population-based study [^69379d28]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Epidemiologic characteristics of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) disease remain largely unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate incidence, prevalence, and mortality of NTM infection in a large nationwide population-based cohort in Korea.

Methods

Data of the National Health Insurance Service database, an extensive health-related database including most Korean residents, were used. Adults with a primary diagnosis of NTM as determined by International Classification of Disease-Tenth Revision coding (A31) were identified between 2003 and 2016. Incidence, prevalence, and mortality of NTM infection were analyzed.

Results

A total of 46,194 individuals had a primary diagnosis of NTM infection. Their mean age was 55.8 years. Of these subjects, 61.1% were females. Annual age-adjusted incidence and prevalence of NTM infection tended to increase rapidly from 2003 to 2016. Age-adjusted incidence and prevalence was 17.9 and 33.3 per 100,000 population in 2016. The incidence and prevalence were higher in females and the elderly. The 5-year mortality rate in the population with NTM infection was 17.8%. The standardized mortality ratio of patients with NTM infection to the general population was 2.16 (95% confidence interval: 2.10 to 2.22).

Conclusions

This large population-based study showed that the incidence and prevalence of NTM infection in Korea increased rapidly from 2003 to 2016. They were higher in women and the elderly. The mortality rate in the population with NTM infection was higher than that in the general population.

### Validity of diagnosis code-based claims to identify pulmonary NTM disease in bronchiectasis patients [^a6d13bd3]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria infection is increasing in incidence and can lead to chronic, debilitating pulmonary disease. We investigated the accuracy of diagnosis code-based nontuberculous mycobacteria lung disease claims among Medicare beneficiaries in the United States. We observed that these claims have moderate validity, but given their low sensitivity, incidence might be underestimated.

### Treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease: an official ATS / ERS / ESCMID / IDSA clinical practice guideline [^4c7b695c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease — pathogenicity and treatment decision framing: Pathogenicity ranges from Mycobacterium gordonae, which rarely causes human disease, to Mycobacterium kansasii, which should usually be considered pathogenic, and while several repeated positive cultures with strong clinical and radiological evidence may be required for low-pathogenicity species, a single positive culture for M. kansasii in the proper context may be sufficient to initiate treatment. Meeting diagnostic criteria alone does not mandate antibiotics, and in some instances, "watchful waiting" may be the preferred course of action, with decisions individualized and discussed with patients including risks, benefits, uncertainties, and the potential for recurrence or reinfection.

### Prevalence, incidence, and mortality of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection in Korea: a nationwide population-based study [^d9165160]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Incidence

Similar to prevalence, age-adjusted incidence of NTM infection was also increased from 2003 to 2016 (Fig. 2). The age-adjusted incidence was 1.0 per 100,000 population in 2003 and 17.9 per 100,000 population in 2016. Women had about 2.5 times higher age-adjusted incidence than men (24.9 vs. 10.4 per 100,000 population). Elderly patients also had higher incidence.

Fig. 2
Incidence of NTM infection between 2003 and 2016 (a) and by age groups (b). The rates are per 100,000 population. NTM = nontuberculous mycobacteria

According to different diagnostic criteria, there were differences in the incidence of NTM infection (Fig. 3). The total number of patients was 46,194 using the inclusion criteria of one or more visits with A31 code as principal diagnosis. It was 128,710 using the inclusion criteria of one or more visits with A31 code as principal or additional diagnosis and 74,144 when using two or more visits with A31 code as principal or additional diagnosis. In each of these three groups of patients, the age-adjusted incidence of NTM infection in 2016 was 17.9, 58.7, and 26.1 per 100,000 population, respectively.

### Epidemiology of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, south Korea, 2007–2016 [^ae699747]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Our study had some limitations. First, because we used diagnosis codes, the distinction between pulmonary and other diseases is unclear, and we could not confirm whether the patients completely met the diagnostic criteria of NTM infection. Second, because we only have data for 2007–2016, we could not exclude patients who had received diagnoses before 2007 when estimating the annual incidence rate. Finally, our definition of NTM infection on the basis of the International Classification of Diseases code may have underestimated the true disease prevalence because prevalence could be affected by loss to follow-up or death during the study period.

In conclusion, we report a substantial increasing trend in the prevalence and incidence of NTM infection in South Korea during 2007–2016 and evaluated regional variations. These data facilitate a better understanding of the epidemiologic trends of NTM infection globally.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence — The grading framework includes categories such as "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" where "Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa" and "Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies", with the implication that "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". For "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence", "Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects" and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient's or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

### Epidemiology of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, south Korea, 2007–2016 [^0666d6d7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The Study

We based our study on the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database, which includes universal health insurance claim data in South Korea. Approximately 97% of the population (≈52 million persons) is included in the system. We obtained demographic and medical data from the database for 2007–2016. We defined NTM infection as the presence of a diagnostic code associated with NTM infection (International Classification of Diseases, 10th ed. code A31) as either a primary or secondary diagnosis and claims data for acid-fast bacilli smears or mycobacterial culture.

We defined annual prevalence as the number of all patients with NTM infection alive during each year and annual incidence as the number of newly diagnosed NTM infections occurring each year after excluding patients who were diagnosed in a previous study period (e.g. patients diagnosed during 2007–2015 were excluded from the estimate of the 2016 incidence rate). We first calculated the crude prevalence rate and incidence rate using each year's total population as the denominator. To adjust for different population structures between years, we calculated the age- and sex-standardized annual prevalence rate and incidence rate of NTM disease using the 2005 population as a standard population, based on the Statistics Korea method. First, we calculated the prevalence and incidence rates for age and sex groups by stratifying all NTM cases into the groups and dividing by the group-specific populations in each year. Then, we multiplied each year's group-specific rates and the group-specific populations in 2005, combined the multiplied values, and divided by the 2005 total population. We calculated standardized overall period prevalence of NTM infection by age, sex, and administrative divisions using the population in the middle of the study period. We conducted statistical analyses using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute). Because we used deidentified data in the study, institutional review board approval and patient consent were not required.

### Cutaneousinfection from tattooing: a common yet under-reported and persistent epidemic hazard for dermatologists [^731b57cb]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Tattoo popularity continues to rise, with 3 in 10 Americans bearing at least one. Among tattoo complications, non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) has emerged as a global public health concern. NTM infections associated with tattooing of immunocompetent individuals have occurred as sporadic cases and community outbreaks. Water sources are considered the major pathogenic reservoirs. Tattoo-related inoculation has been linked to contamination of ink, either during the manufacturing process or during dilution of black ink using non-sterile water. NTM infections have also been documented in a number of cosmetic and surgical procedures, including cutaneous surgery, Mohs micrographic surgery, mesotherapy, liposuction and laser resurfacing. NTM inoculation through exposure to contaminated water or non-sterile instruments remains a challenge for dermatologists and risk to patients. We reported a case of cutaneous Mycobacterium massiliense infection following tattoo placement. This report underscores the importance of clinicians to consider NTM infections in the differential diagnosis of procedure-related reactions.

### Nontuberculous mycobacterial infection related to nasal implant [^7eb5868c]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are important pathogens for cutaneous infections related to contaminated environments and invasive procedures. A 43-year-old woman presented with swelling of the forehead. Ten years ago, she underwent augmentation rhinoplasty using silicone implant. In response to the swelling, an incision was made, pus-like discharge was drained, and the nasal silicone implant was removed. Although routine culture and NTM culture showed negative results, NTM polymerase chain reaction detected NTM infection. After continued clarithromycin medication for 3 months, the patient recovered without recurrence of infection. Mycobacteria are rarely detected with routine bacterial culture and are often resistant to empiric antibacterial agents. Therefore, the possibility of NTM infection should always be included in differential diagnosis, when evaluating skin lesions, regardless of the immune status of the patient.

### Mortality rate and cause of death in adults with extrapulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria infection, Denmark [^808f991b]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design

This study was a nationwide retrospective register-based cohort study from Denmark. The healthcare system is based on tax-funded universal healthcare. Different types of registers can be linked by using a unique 10-digit personal identification number issued to all citizens.

Data Sources and Measurement

The Danish Register of Causes of Death contains data on time, place, and cause of death using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for all deaths occurring in Denmark. We identified all patients with extrapulmonary NTM infection using International Classification of Diseases, 8th Revision (ICD-8), and ICD-10 diagnostic codes from the National Patient Register. The register contains the ICD-8 and ICD-10 diagnostic codes and procedural codes on all inpatients from 1977 and all outpatients since 1995. To evaluate the effects of baseline comorbidities on mortality, we calculated a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) as described by Quan et al. using ICD-10 codes from the National Patient Register.

Study Subjects

We included patients > 18 years of age with a first-time extrapulmonary NTM disease ICD-10 code (A31.1, A31.8, or A31.9) during 2000–2017. The date of the first registered extrapulmonary NTM code was considered the index date. For persons without an extrapulmonary NTM–specific ICD-10 code (A31.1), we used procedural codes for specific examinations and treatments to differentiate between extrapulmonary NTM and other NTM disease manifestations in windows of 1 year on either side of the index date (Appendix Table). Patients and controls were censored from the study at death, migration, or end of data. We matched patients with extrapulmonary NTM disease to controls at a ratio of 1:4 at index. Controls were randomly selected from the total population of Denmark and matched by birth year, sex, marital status, and municipality of residence. The controls entered the study at the same date as the case-patient to whom they were matched. We excluded persons with an ICD-8 or ICD-10 code of A31 from the possible control population to ensure a nonbiased representative sample.

### Incidence of nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary infection, by ethnic group, Hawaii, USA, 2005–2019 [^9d318447]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Population

We abstracted demographic, clinical, and microbiological data from KPH electronic health records (EHRs) for the years 2005–2019. We included beneficiaries for each year in which they were enrolled for > 9 months; we excluded persons > 90 years of age according to limited dataset regulations. Longitudinal demographic data included age on July 1 for each study year, sex, postal code, and census tract–level socioeconomic measures (median household income, neighborhood deprivation index, percentage graduated from high school). The neighborhood deprivation index is a measure of neighborhood-level socioeconomic status calculated by Kaiser Permanente. The index captures census tract–level measures of income, education, employment, housing, and occupation; higher scores indicate higher deprivation.

Demographic data included self-reported ethnicity; the standard KPH beneficiary enrollment form enables identification with > 1 of 28 ethnic groups (Table 1). Additional health variables abstracted included height, weight, BMI, and smoking status. We searched EHRs for a set of prespecified codes from the International Classification of Disease, 9th and 10th revisions (ICD-9/10), for relevant underlying conditions ever coded. Although KPH does not serve the entire population of Hawaii, comparison with census data indicates that the KPH beneficiary population is generally representative of Hawaii residents with respect to age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (Appendix Table 2).

### Comorbidities of nontuberculous mycobacteria infection in Korean adults: results from the national health insurance service-national sample cohort (NHIS-NSC) database [^bbbaca78]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Comorbidities and matching variables

In this study, diseases that were previously frequently reported as comorbidities in patients with NTM infection or were known risk factors were included as comorbidities of interest. We also included a list of the most frequently claimed disease codes by examining the frequency of all disease codes claimed by patients with NTM infection from NHIS–NSC 2.0 data. Consequently, we investigated the distribution of 26 comorbidities potentially associated with NTM infection (Table 1). Comorbidities were identified with the ICD-10 code when there were two or more claims, and only claims up to 1 year before the index date were included. All methods were performed in accordance with the approved guidelines and regulations. Informed consent was waived, as this is a retrospective study of deidentified administrative data.

Table 1
ICD-10 codes for definition of comorbidities for nontuberculous mycobacterial infection

To identify diseases frequently associated with age, age was classified into four groups (20–39, 40–59, 60–79, and 80–89 years old). The income groups initially comprising 11 classes (class 0, lowest income; class 10, highest income) in the NHIS database were recategorized into three groups (low, class 0–2; medium, class 3–7; high, class 8–10). Region of residence was recategorized into urban (Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Incheon, Gwangju, Daejeon, and Ulsan) and rural (Gyeonggi, Gangwon, Chungcheongbuk, Chungcheongnam, Jeollabuk, Jeollanam, Gyeongsangbuk, Gyeongsangnam, and Jeju).

Statistical analysis

General characteristics were compared between patients with NTM infection and the control group using an independent t -test for continuous variables and the chi-squared test for categorical variables. To compare the distribution of comorbidities between control and NTM groups, logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Subgroup analyses according to sex and age were also conducted. All analyses were conducted using SAS Enterprise Guide 7.1 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA). Statistical significance was defined as a two-sided P value of < 0.05.

### Pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria-associated deaths, Ontario, Canada, 2001–2013 [^2214c6de]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

A comprehensive population-based study from Denmark observed death rates of 39.7% for MAC-PD and 51.0% for M. xenopi disease, compared with 36.3% and 43.2% in our study. The higher rates of death in the Denmark study are interesting considering that the cohort was younger and had a smaller proportion of patients with COPD, diabetes, and renal disease. However, because the Denmark study did not provide detailed clinical characteristics and comprised approximately one third M. gordonae patients, comparing that cohort with the cohort in our study is difficult. Despite methodologic differences, the odds ratio (OR) for death in a Medicare-based study in the United States (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.3–1.6) was similar to our HR for death in survival analysis (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.56–1.70). The US study comprised only patients who were > 65 years, not enrolled in a health maintenance organization, and identified with NTM infection using codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). Restricting our cohort to patients > 65 years of age would exclude > 37% of all patients with NTM-PD. Although the use of ICD-9 codes to identify patients with NTM infection has not been validated, this method appears to be specific but relatively insensitive, introducing bias depending on characteristics of NTM-infected patients not detected by this method.

### Medical tourism and postoperative infections: a systematic literature review of causative organisms and empiric treatment [^dfa47e9d]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Medical tourism has become increasingly globalized as individuals travel abroad to receive medical care. Cosmetic patients in particular are more likely to seek surgery abroad to defray costs. Unfortunately, not all procedures performed abroad adhere to strict hygienic regulations, and bacterial flora vary. As a result, it is not uncommon for consumers to return home with difficult-to-treat postoperative infections.

Methods

A systematic literature review of PubMed, Ovid, Web of Science, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases was performed to assess the microbiology patterns and medical management of patients with postoperative infections after undergoing elective surgery abroad.

Results

Forty-two cases of postoperative infections were reported among patients who underwent elective surgery abroad. Most cases were reported from the Dominican Republic, and the most common elective procedures were abdominoplasty, mastopexy, and liposuction. Rapidly growing mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium abscessus, Mycobacterium fortuitum, and Mycobacterium chelonae were among the most common causes of postoperative infection, with M. abscessus involving 74 percent of cases. Most cases were treated with surgical débridement and a combination of antibiotics. Clarithromycin, amikacin, and moxifloxacin were the most common drugs used for long-term treatment.

Conclusions

When encountering a patient with a history of medical tourism and treatment-refractory infection, rapidly growing mycobacteria must be considered. To increase the likelihood of yielding a diagnostic organism, multiple acid-fast bacilli cultures from fluid and débridement content should be performed. There has been reported success in treating rapidly growing mycobacterial infections with a combination of antibiotics including clarithromycin, amikacin, and moxifloxacin.

### Rapidly growing mycobacteria associated with laparoscopic gastric banding, Australia, 2005–2011 [^1c4e7a80]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The exponential increase in obesity and morbid obesity worldwide has led to a corresponding increase in bariatric surgical procedures to prevent obesity-associated illness and death. Laparoscopic gastric banding is a restrictive procedure involving insertion of an inflatable silicon band at the gastric cardia near the gastro-esophageal junction, which enables adjustment of the size of the outlet through the addition or removal of aqueous solution through a subcutaneous port in the abdominal wall. It is the most common bariatric procedure performed in Australia and the United Kingdom; perceived advantages include its less technical surgical demands and low rates of perioperative complications. More than 11,000 procedures were performed in Australia during 2011. Infection rates are reportedly low but can occur at the site of the subcutaneous port or be associated with the band itself.

Rapidly growing mycobacteria are ubiquitous organisms found in environmental sources, including soil and water. They cause skin and soft tissue infections and pulmonary disease but also have a predilection for causing diseases involving implanted prosthetic material. Infections associated with silicone implants, indwelling intravenous or peritoneal catheters, cardiac devices, and prosthetic joints have been reported. Isolated cases of mycobacterial infection involving gastric banding have been reported in recent years. We report 18 cases of rapidly growing mycobacterial infections associated with laparoscopic gastric banding in Australia during 2005–2011.

### Prevalence, incidence, and mortality of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection in Korea: a nationwide population-based study [^aa91a7a2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The prevalence of NTM infection was defined as the number of individuals visiting medical institutions who were assigned ICD-10 code A31 for NTM as the principal diagnosis. Only patients who visited the medical institution that year were included in the prevalence analysis because we tried to exclude patients who no longer suffer from NTM infection without using the medical institution. For incidence analysis, we used three different criteria. First, a new case of NTM infection was defined at a patient's first visit with ICD-10 code A31 assigned as the principal diagnosis. Second, a new case of NTM infection was defined at a patient's first visit with A31 code as the principal or additional diagnosis. Third, a new case was defined at a first visit in a patient having at least two or more visits with A31 code as principal or additional diagnosis. We used the first inclusion criterion as the primary method of incidence analysis and compared it with the other two inclusion criteria. If a person was identified as NTM multiple times, only the first identification was included in the incidence analysis.

For mortality analysis, individuals were followed up until the end of the study period or death. The time of death was recorded in year and month. The standardized mortality ratio was used to compare the mortality rate of those with NTM infection to that of the general Korean population. The immediate cause of death in the death certificate was used to classify the cause of death, including tuberculosis (A15–19), pneumonia (J12–18), chronic lower respiratory disease (J40–47), lung cancer (C34), other cancer (C00–97, except C34), cardiovascular disease (I20–25, I30–52), cerebrovascular disease (I60–69), diabetes mellitus (E10–14), and hypertension (I10–15) according to the Korean Standard Classification of Disease and Cause of Death-Sixth revision.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics were performed for all variables. Annual NTM-related visits by sex, age, and region of residence were analyzed for incidence and prevalence. The general population living in Korea was used as the denominator for the prevalence and incidence analysis. The population during the middle of 2010 was used as a standard statistical population. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to calculate the overall survival of NTM patients by sex, age, and CCI. The SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.

### Prevalence of nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease, Germany, 2009–2014 [^f13e0959]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The Study

This study was based on the population of Germany of ≈81 million during 2009–2014, and a subgroup of ≈70 million persons (86%) covered by German statutory health insurance (Table 1). Because this study was based on anonymous routine data, institutional review board approval and patient consent were not required. We obtained anonymous health claims data from the Health Risk Institute health services research database, which contains a subset of ≈7 million persons covered by statutory health insurance. This database has been validated and shows good overall accuracy in documenting the German population in terms of illness, death, and drug usage; in addition, the number of insured persons in the database remains high over time. We established data characteristics by adjustments for age and sex according to the distribution within the general population of Germany. Only persons who were continuously insured within the respective year were considered. Of those persons, we obtained a 5% sample representative of the German population for each year of the study period, consisting of ≈4 million persons per year (Table 1). From these samples, we extracted records that used the ICD-10 diagnosis code A31.0 (NTM-PD) for either a primary or a secondary diagnosis, and we analyzed data according to age, sex, the site of healthcare provision (Table 1), and the most common and relevant associated conditions, as represented by concomitantly recorded ICD-10 codes (Table 2).

### Breast implant mycobacterial infections: an epidemiologic review and outcome analysis [^d642d096]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemiologic evidence of periprosthetic mycobacterial infections is limited. The recent boom in cosmetic surgery tourism has been associated with a rise of surgical-site infections in returning patients. This review aims to explore available data, examine trends of documented periprosthetic mycobacterial infections, and analyze outcomes of management techniques.

Methods

A search in the Biosis, Embase, LILACS, MEDLINE, and Web of Science databases from inception until December of 2017 for "Breast Implants" and "Mycobacterial Infections" and equivalents was performed. Data were pooled after two screening rounds following full-text retrieval and cross-referencing.

Results

Forty-one reports describing 171 female patients who had breast prosthesis-related mycobacterial infections were identified. Bibliometric case-based analysis revealed a rise of periprosthetic mycobacterial infections in developing countries since the start of the millennium. The mean patient's age was 37.9 years and the majority of patients had undergone bilateral breast augmentation. Most patients presented with breast pain or tenderness, after an average incubation period of 9 months. Mycobacterium fortuitum was isolated from 90 cases (52.6 percent). Immediate explantation with or without delayed reimplantation was the most commonly used surgical strategy, complemented by combination antimicrobial therapy for an average of 4.6 months. The mean follow-up time was 39.7 months, during which recurrence was observed in 21 of 171 patients (12.3 percent).

Conclusions

The emergence of periprosthetic mycobacterial infections in relation to cosmetic medical tourism alerts clinicians to the importance of educating the public about the associated risks. In addition, this study identifies risk factors associated with recurrence of periprosthetic mycobacterial infections.

Context

Nontuberculous mycobacteria include numerous acid-fast bacilli species, many of which have only recently been recognized as pathogenic. The diagnosis of mycobacterial disease is based on a combination of clinical features, microbiologic data, radiographic findings, and histopathologic studies.

Objective

To provide an overview of the clinical and pathologic aspects of nontuberculous mycobacteria infection, including diagnostic laboratory methods, classification, epidemiology, clinical presentation, and treatment.

Data Sources

Review of the pertinent literature and published methodologies.

Conclusions

Nontuberculous mycobacteria include numerous acid-fast bacilli species, many of which are potentially pathogenic, and are classified according to the Runyon system based on growth rates and pigment production. Their slow growth hinders cultures, which require special medium and prolonged incubation. Although such methods are still used, newer nucleic acid-based technologies (polymerase chain reaction and hybridization assays) can rapidly detect and speciate some mycobacteria — most notably, distinguishing Mycobacterium tuberculosis from other species. Infections caused by these organisms can present as a variety of clinical syndromes, not only in immunocompromised patients but also in immunocompetent hosts. Most common among these are chronic pulmonary infections, superficial lymphadenitis, soft tissue and osteoarticular infections, and disseminated disease. Treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections is difficult, requiring extended courses of multidrug therapy with or without adjunctive surgical intervention.

Introduction

Autologous fat injection is a cosmetic procedure performed to enhance the cosmetic appearance. Infections with nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), such as Mycobacterium fortuitum, following cryopreserved fat injection have been reported. Mycobacterium mageritense is a rapidly growing NTM, and to date, there have been only a few reported cases of skin and soft tissue infection with M mageritense. Herein, we describe 2 siblings who had subcutaneous infection with M mageritense following cryopreserved fat injection performed at a single clinic. To the best of our knowledge, these 2 patients are the first reported subcutaneous infections on the face caused by M mageritense.

At a glance
- When you see a patient with potential nontuberculous mycobacteria disease, carefully evaluate for risks and potential exposures.
- Signs and symptoms can be vague and are dependent on the site of infection.
- Both rapid and slow-growing species can cause infections at different body sites. Overview Risk for NTM infections increases for patients who are older, immunocompromised or have conditions like open wounds. NTM outbreaks typically happen in healthcare settings if procedures expose patients to contaminated water. Pulmonary infections are the most common clinical manifestation of NTM infection. Extrapulmonary infection surveillance can help find healthcare-associated infections and outbreaks faster. Types There are more than 190 recognized species of NTM. Some of these cause disease in humans.

NTM can be divided into two groups based on how long they take to grow in a culture:

- **Rapid-growing species**: Usually grow within 7 to 10 days.
- Slow-growing species: May need more than 14 days to grow. Rapid-growing species M. abscessus M. chelonae M. fortuitum M. mucogenicum Slow-growing species M. aviumcomplex M. intracellulare subsp. chimaera M. kansasii M. marinum. Risk factors Susceptibility to NTM infections increases for patients who are older, immunocompromised or have other medical conditions like open wounds. How it spreads NTM can form difficult-to-eliminate biofilms. Biofilms are collections of microorganisms that stick to each other and adhere to surfaces in moist environments, like the insides of pipes. Potable water in residential buildings and healthcare settings is a common source of exposure to NTMs. Contaminated water can spread through:

- Decorative fountains and water features.
- Hydrotherapy equipment, such as jetted therapy baths.
- Ice machines.
- Intravenous infusions or intramuscular or intradermal injections.
- Medical equipment such as respiratory machines, bronchoscopes and heater-cooler devices.
- Shower heads and sink faucets. Large healthcare buildings pose certain challenges because of their complex water systems. This can result in water stagnation and growth of microorganisms like NTM. Outbreaks NTM outbreaks have been related to a variety of medical procedures and practices, including:

- Cosmetic surgery.
- Dental procedures.
- Injection preparation and administration.
- Manufacturing of medical products.
- Medical tourism.
- Medication preparation.
- Medicine compounding and mixing.
- Surgery, such as breast surgery; heart surgery, including the use of heater-cooler devices; eye surgery with exposure to consumer-grade humidifiers.

Clinical features Pulmonary infections are the most common clinical manifestation of NTM infection and are primarily community-acquired. These infections:

- Have vague/non-specific signs and symptoms, including shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, malaise and weight loss.
- Most commonly occur in patients with underlying lung disease such as cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis and emphysema. A disorder known as "Lady Windermere syndrome" occurs in elderly, thin women without pre-existing lung disease, particularly those with scoliosis, pectus excavatum or mitral valve prolapse.
- Are usually not possible to trace back to a particular exposure given an extended latency period and multiple potential exposures. Extrapulmonary infections can result from exposures in or out of healthcare settings.

Comparator classification by ICD-10 codes

We also inferred the infection being treated using only ICD-10 codes and no free-text to provide a comparison with this traditional approach. We mapped primary and secondary ICD-10 diagnosis codes from the same admission as the antibiotic prescription to the 11 infection sources using CCSR classificationsas an intermediate step (see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Note S2). We then compared infection sources extracted from free-text indications to infection sources derived from ICD-10 codes.

Methods

Data Source and Study Population

We used data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), specifically the State Inpatient Databases (SID). The SIDs provide record-level data, without personal identifiers, on nearly 100% of community hospital discharges in participating states. Records were included for hospitalizations that had an International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), code associated with pulmonary NTM (031.0) as a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis. The study population included all records for persons hospitalized with pulmonary NTM as a primary or secondary diagnosis in the 11 states participating in HCUP (Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Washington, and Wisconsin) during the years specified. These states represented 42% of the US population during the study period.

Data Analysis

Data elements available in the HCUP dataset included year of hospitalization, age when hospitalized, sex, state where hospitalization occurred, type of NTM infection (pulmonary, disseminated, cutaneous, unspecified, or other) and up to 29 possible secondary diagnoses. No information on mycobacterial species is available in this dataset. Because NTM is known to be a common opportunistic infection among people with AIDS, particularly before the widespread availability of combination antiretroviral medications, we limited our analysis to non-AIDS NTM using the code for HIV/AIDS (042), which indicates hospitalizations where AIDS was known to be an underlying illness. Additionally, we restricted our analysis to the 1998–2005 study period to avoid misclassification among types of NTM because the ICD-9-CM code for disseminated NTM was introduced in 1997. Before implementation, hospitalizations associated with disseminated NTM may have been included in the 4 other NTM categories (pulmonary, cutaneous, unspecified, other). We examined prevalence trends in pulmonary NTM by age and sex and described the most frequently associated underlying illnesses. To analyze the most frequent secondary underlying illnesses, we grouped the following conditions/codes as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): obstructive chronic bronchitis with and without exacerbation (ICD-9-CM 491.21, 491.22); emphysema not elsewhere classified (492.8); chronic obstructive asthma (493.20); and chronic airway obstruction not elsewhere classified (496).

### Validity of diagnosis code-based claims to identify pulmonary NTM disease in bronchiectasis patients [^8a480250]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

A limitation of our study is that we only included Medicare beneficiaries > 65 years of age with bronchiectasis; also, BRR collects data from specialized NTM centers, which might differ from general clinic settings. Our Medicare data ended in 2014, limiting the sample size and overlap with BRR observation time. Last, we only evaluated ICD-9-CM codes, although ICD Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), codes have been required since 2015. However, understanding the validity of ICD-9-CM codes is essential for interpretation of the existing literature that is based on ICD-9-CM codes and to inform future research using ICD-10-CM codes. Further, ICD-9-CM codes for NTM map directly to ICD-10-CM codes (ICD-9-CM 031.0 equates to ICD-10-CM A31.0 [pulmonary mycobacterial infection]), helping guide future comparisons.

Our results indicate that a case definition of > 2 claims given 30 days apart within 12 months of each other accurately identifies pulmonary NTM infection in patients who also have bronchiectasis. Given low sensitivity, incidence might be severely underestimated in claims-based epidemiologic research. Claims data provide critical information about the epidemiology of NTM infection when clinical data are not available, but findings should be interpreted with awareness of the potential for misclassification.

Subjects and Methods

Study Population

We conducted a nested case-control study using the 100% US Medicare Parts A and B administrative claims database for January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2015. This population-based database includes beneficiaries in all 50 US states. A case of NTM-PD was defined as ≥ 2 claims with a diagnostic code for NTM-PD (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] 031.0; International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-10-CM] A31.0) that were ≥ 30 days apart. We also restricted our analysis to patients with NTM-PD who were aged ≥ 65 years at the time of first diagnosis of NTM-PD. Control subjects were defined as Medicare beneficiaries without any NTM-PD claims during the study period. Each case subject was matched to two control subjects according to age (± 0.5 years) and sex. The index date for each NTM-PD case was defined as the date of the first NTM-PD claim; the index date for each case was assigned to the matched control subjects. Both case subjects and matched control subjects were required to have at least 12 months of continuous coverage of Medicare Parts A and Bprior to the index date.

Nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) pulmonary disease — species, diagnosis, and treatment overview is outlined as follows: Members of Mycobacterium avium complex, which "now consists of 12 separate species", and species including "M. avium, M. intracellulare, and M. chimaera", as well as "M. kansasii and M. xenopi", commonly cause pulmonary disease, while "M. abscessus and its subspecies abscessus, bolletii, and massiliense are by far the most common causative agents of pulmonary disease due to rapidly growing mycobacteria". Diagnosis "requires the synthesis of clinical, radiographic, and microbiology data", and identification to species — and for "M. abscessus, to the subspecies level" — "can provide important clinical and epidemiologic information". Treatment "varies depending on the species (in some cases subspecies), extent of disease, drug susceptibility results (with limitations), and underlying comorbidities", with regimens that "require the use of multiple antimicrobials" over "prolonged periods", yet "treatment outcomes are often suboptimal, and reinfection with another strain or species is common", and "In many settings, expert consultation is helpful".

### Epidemiology of Mycobacterium abscessus [^08bd4a7c]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are highly abundant in soil, dust, and water sources, making human-pathogen contact frequent and recurrent. NTM represents over 200 species/subspecies; some are considered strict or opportunistic pathogens. Mycobacterium abscessus, often regarded as one of the most antibiotic-resistant mycobacteria, is the second most frequent NTM pulmonary disease pathogen.

Objectives

To describe the epidemiology of M. abscessus through a literature review focusing on clinical aspects.

Sources

We conducted searches on PubMed and Web of Knowledge for articles published from 2010 to the present using the keywords 'Mycobacterium abscessus', 'Nontuberculous mycobacteria', and 'epidemiology'. Our search prioritized original reports on the occurrence of NTM and M. abscessus infection/disease.

Content

Advanced molecular and genetic diagnostic techniques have refined the M. abscessus complex (MABC) microbiological classification over the last few decades. MABC can adhere to surfaces and form a biofilm. This characteristic and its resistance to common disinfectants allow these microorganisms to persist in the water distribution systems, becoming a constant reservoir. The frequency and manifestation of NTM species vary geographically because of environmental conditions and population susceptibility differences. MABC lung disease, the most frequent site of NTM infection in humans, is often seen in patients with underlying lung diseases such as bronchiectasis, whereas MABC disseminated disease is related to immunosuppression. Skin and soft tissue infections are associated with surgical or injection procedures. Epidemiological evidence suggests an overall increase in MABC infection and disease in the last decade.

Implications

Establishing the burden of this disease is challenging because of varying measures of incidence and prevalence, referral bias, and differences in medical practices and reporting. Furthermore, environmental and structural determinants, infection routes, and MABC pulmonary disease mechanisms require additional investigation. This review contributes to a better understanding of the epidemiology of MABC, which could inform clinical practice and future research.

### Extrapulmonary infections associated with nontuberculous mycobacteria in immunocompetent persons [^be1d24eb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Over the past several years, the prevalence of human disease caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) has increased. Whether the increase in cases is real or whether more cases are being recognized remains unclear. Despite a considerable increase in knowledge about NTM infections, they still represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for several reasons: 1) pathogenic isolates may be indistinguishable from contaminant or saprophytic isolates; 2) timely and reliable identification of isolates may depend on proper communication between clinicians and laboratory staff; 3) lack of standardized susceptibility testing makes adoption of tailored therapies unrealistic; and 4) lack of treatment guidelines exposes patients to toxic drugs and disappointing outcomes. Laboratory research and multicenter controlled trials are needed to improve diagnosis and treatment of these infections.

### A case of culture-proven cutaneous atypical mycobacterial infection caused by… [^c1da91db]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mycobacterium immunogenum is an atypical, rapidly growing mycobacterium related to the M chelonae - M abscessus group. Infection with this pathogen can cause a variety of clinical manifestations, with cutaneous involvement being particularly common. Cutaneous infections include folliculitis, ulceration due to exposure to contaminated water, and postsurgical and postinjection skin infections. Additionally, M immunogenum may also present as erythematous papules, nodules, and plaques, often following invasive procedures. Beyond the skin, it is most commonly implicated in hypersensitivity pneumonitis, associated with metalworking fluids. There have also been reports of keratitis, tenosynovitis, and cerebral abscess caused by the pathogen. Here we present a case of cutaneous nontuberculous atypical mycobacterial infection caused by M immunogenum in a patient with no identifiable risk factors, highlighting an unusual presentation of this pathogen.

Patient Demographic and Clinical Characteristics

An overview of the study sample construction is provided in Figure 1. From 2007 through 2015, a total of 58,791 Medicare Parts A and B beneficiaries fulfilled the NTM-PD case definition (≥ 2 claims for NTM-PD ≥ 30 days apart); among these patients, 35,444 patients were ≥ 65 years old and had ≥ 12 months of continuous enrollment in Parts A and B prior to the index date and thus comprised the NTM-PD cohort.

Figure 1
Study cohort. a Index date was defined as the date the first NTM-PD diagnostic code (ICD-9-CM 031.0 or ICD-10-CM A31.0) was received for patients with NTM-PD, and this date was assigned to the matched control subjects as their index date. ICD-9-CM = International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification; ICD-10-CM = International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification; NTM-PD = nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease.

The baseline characteristics of the NTM-PD cohort (n = 35,444) and the matched control subjects (n = 65,467) are provided in Table 1. The mean age was 76.6 years, and the majority were female (70.0%) and White (≥ 87%). The mean CCI score was higher in the NTM-PD cohort (2.3 ± 1.5) than in matched control subjects (1.2 ± 1.4). Most comorbidities were more common in the NTM-PD cohort than in the matched control subjects. Baseline differences were especially pronounced for pulmonary comorbidities, with proportions for the NTM-PD vs control groups being 81.1% vs 17.7% for COPD, 54.5% vs 6.6% for pneumonia, 44.6% vs 0.6% for bronchiectasis, 33.3% vs 4.5% for exacerbation of respiratory disease (acute or chronic), 27.3% vs 8.0% for asthma, and 19.4% vs 3.7% for empyema. The proportions of patients with these comorbidities were significantly different (two-sided χ 2 test, P < .01).

### Treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease: an official ATS / ERS / ESCMID / IDSA clinical practice guideline [^0885604e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) represent over 190 species and subspecies, some of which can produce disease in humans of all ages and can affect both pulmonary and extrapulmonary sites. This guideline focuses on pulmonary disease in adults (without cystic fibrosis or human immunodeficiency virus infection) caused by the most common NTM pathogens such as Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium kansasii, and Mycobacterium xenopi among the slowly growing NTM and Mycobacterium abscessus among the rapidly growing NTM. A panel of experts was carefully selected by leading international respiratory medicine and infectious diseases societies (ATS, ERS, ESCMID, IDSA) and included specialists in pulmonary medicine, infectious diseases and clinical microbiology, laboratory medicine, and patient advocacy. Systematic reviews were conducted around each of 22 PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) questions and the recommendations were formulated, written, and graded using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Thirty-one evidence-based recommendations about treatment of NTM pulmonary disease are provided. This guideline is intended for use by healthcare professionals who care for patients with NTM pulmonary disease, including specialists in infectious diseases and pulmonary diseases.

### Clinical management of rapidly growing mycobacterial cutaneous infections in patients after mesotherapy [^4a2d2eef]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Increasing numbers of patients are expressing an interest in mesotherapy as a method of reducing body fat. Cutaneous infections due to rapidly growing mycobacteria are a common complication of such procedures.

Methods

We followed up patients who had developed cutaneous infections after undergoing mesotherapy during the period October 2006-January 2007.

Results

Sixteen patients were infected after mesotherapy injections performed by the same physician. All patients presented with painful, erythematous, draining subcutaneous nodules at the injection sites. All patients were treated with surgical drainage. Microbiological examination was performed on specimens that were obtained before and during the surgical procedure. Direct examination of skin smears demonstrated acid-fast bacilli in 25% of the specimens that were obtained before the procedure and 37% of the specimens obtained during the procedure; culture results were positive in 75% of the patients. Mycobacterium chelonae was identified in 11 patients, and Mycobacterium frederiksbergense was identified in 2 patients. Fourteen patients were treated with antibiotics, 6 received triple therapy as first-line treatment (tigecycline, tobramycin, and clarithromycin), and 8 received dual therapy (clarithromycin and ciprofloxacin). The mean duration of treatment was 14 weeks (range, 1–24 weeks). All of the patients except 1 were fully recovered 2 years after the onset of infection, with the mean time to healing estimated at 6.2 months (range, 1–15 months).

Conclusions

This series of rapidly growing mycobacterial cutaneous infections highlights the difficulties in treating such infections and suggests that in vitro susceptibility to antibiotics does not accurately predict their clinical efficacy.

### Nontuberculous mycobacterial musculoskeletal infection cases from a tertiary referral center, Colorado, USA [^fe6175d6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Given the importance in identifying NTM musculoskeletal infections in the immunocompromised or those with prior surgery, it is unfortunate that our data did not identify more substantial diagnostic criteria based upon inflammatory markers. Whereas the ESR in our patients was usually elevated, the C-reactive protein and leukocyte counts were typically normal. The patient who failed treatment had one of the highest ESRs in our patient group, nearly double the median value of 38 at intake, perhaps because of her chronic autoimmune condition.

All patients had positive mycobacterial cultures at time of initial diagnosis. Thirteen of 14 patients were receiving mycobacterial therapy at the time of surgery at our institution and only half of them were persistently positive for mycobacterial growth despite ongoing symptoms and intraoperative observation of sinus tract formation and suppuration. We are familiar with this phenomenon, and therefore do not require a positive culture to define failure of therapy. If a patient has ongoing signs of infection while receiving effective antimicrobial drugs (based on drug sensitivity testing), then they need more aggressive resection of infected tissue. The 3 patients with PJI and rapidly growing NTM infection all required prolonged courses of IV and oral antimicrobial therapy. One of the 3 patients with M. avium complex–related PJI also required 2 months of concomitant IV amikacin. All patients with PJIs required explantation of the infected hardware followed by antimicrobial spacer placement for > 3 months in addition to ongoing postoperative oral or intravenous antimicrobial therapy to achieve a successful outcome. In > 5 cases, microbiologic diagnosis of mycobacterial infection was only confirmed during the initial surgical intervention, and in each of these cases, prior or subsequent surgeries were required for ultimate control of infection. Ultimately, the fact that 10/14 cases required multiple surgeries for control of infection with long intervals from onset of symptoms and initial seeking of care to identification of the infectious agent and finally definitive surgical treatment underscores the need for early identification and aggressive treatment of NTM infection.

### Cutaneous nontuberculous mycobacterial infections in Japan: review of the Japanese literature [^d8227b89]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria cause a wide range of infections, including cutaneous infections, in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. Although pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infections have increased significantly in Japan in recent years, there is less evidence on clinical and microbiological characteristics of cutaneous nontuberculous mycobacterial infections in Japan. We reviewed 86 Japanese cases reported between July 2016 and November 2021 and analyzed them in conjunction with the eight patients from our institution who were diagnosed with cutaneous nontuberculous mycobacterial infections by culture between 2015 and 2021. In the aggregate series, the average patient age was 60years, and the ratio of immunocompromised hosts was 53%, both of which were higher than those in previous reports from other countries. No female predominance was observed, unlike in pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria infections. Rapidly growing mycobacteria accounted for 58% of the cases (n = 54), whereas slowly growing mycobacteria for 43% (n = 40). Mycobacterium marinum (also known as Mycobacteroides marinum) (n = 20, 21%) was the most common cause, followed by Mycobacterium chelonae (n = 18, 19%), Mycobacterium abscessus (also known as Mycobacteroides abscessus) (n = 15, 16%), and Mycobacterium ulcerans (n = 11, 12%). While clinical appearance was variable, M ulcerans infections usually presented with ulcers, while nodules were common among infections caused by M chelonae and M marinum. Disseminated infections involving multiple organs were observed in 23 patients (24%). Thirty-two cases (30%) were preceded by exposure, including raising or handling fish, trauma, and invasive medical procedures. Most patients were treated with more than two antibiotics and responded to therapy.

### Extrapulmonary infections associated with nontuberculous mycobacteria in immunocompetent persons [^8119444e]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Although NTM cause a broad spectrum of human disease, data on incidence of NTM infections are still lacking, mainly because of the absence of systematic epidemiologic studies, standard case definitions, and accurate mycobacterial identification. Furthermore, nonspecific clinical manifestations, lack of familiarity with these infections, and inadequate laboratory services make definitive diagnosis of NTM diseases often delayed or even impossible. Correlation of in vitro susceptibility testing with the clinical outcome, composition and duration of treatment regimens, and use of surgery or other therapeutic approaches are still undefined for most NTM species involved in human diseases. Laboratory research and multicenter controlled trials are needed to improve diagnosis and treatment of extrapulmonary NTM infections.

### Treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease: an official ATS / ERS / ESCMID / IDSA clinical practice guideline [^50093e13]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) pulmonary disease — initiation of therapy versus watchful waiting: In patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for NTM pulmonary disease, we suggest initiation of treatment rather than watchful waiting, especially in the context of positive acid-fast bacilli sputum smears and/or cavitary lung disease (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in estimates of effect). The evidence base notes that no randomized, controlled trials have been conducted and that limited retrospective data failed to demonstrate that treatment prolongs survival over watchful waiting. Natural history and management vary: among 488 patients with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) pulmonary disease followed for at least 1 year, 305 (62.5%) progressed, whereas 51.6% underwent spontaneous sputum conversion during a median follow-up of 5.6 years, and observational cohorts report that 28–81% of patients are offered treatment. Implementation emphasizes that the decision to initiate antimicrobial therapy should be individualized based on clinical factors, the infecting species, and patient priorities.

Notes from the Field: Nontuberculous Mycobacteria Infections After Cosmetic Surgery Procedures in Florida — Nine States, 2022–2023 Weekly / January 25, 2024 / 73; 66–67 Katharine E. Saunders, DNP. Summary What is already known about this topic. Nontuberculous mycobacteria have been reported as a cause of health care–associated infections. What is added by this report. Investigation of a case of NTM infection in a patient who received a cosmetic surgical procedure in Florida identified a total of 15 cases in nine states in patients who received cosmetic surgical procedures at the same facility in Florida. Multiple lapses in infection control and prevention were found at an outpatient cosmetic surgery clinic operating with the same staff members. What are the implications for public health practice.

Health care providers should have a high index of suspicion for extrapulmonary NTM when evaluating patients for postsurgical infection after cosmetic procedures and should be aware of the threshold for notifying public health officials of these cases. Altmetric: Table. Introduction Mycobacterium abscessus is a species of intrinsically multidrug–resistant, rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacteria known to cause health care–associated infections and implicated in skin and soft tissue infections after cosmetic surgical procedures. On February 7, 2023, CDC notified the Florida Department of Health of a non-Florida resident with NTM infection after a cosmetic procedure at a surgery clinic in south Florida. FDOH and CDC issued national Epidemic Information Exchange notices in March 2023 to identify additional infections.

During the ensuing investigation in March 2023, FDOH identified a total of 15 NTM infections in patients who underwent surgical procedures by a plastic surgeon in solo practice at clinic A, an alternative practice location that was used during renovation of the permanent facility. Investigation and Outcomes Case Definition A case was defined as the isolation of M. abscessus from a wound culture obtained from a patient who underwent a cosmetic procedure at clinic A during August–December 2022. Among 19 reported infections, a total of 15 patients from nine U. S. states met the case definition. The other four patients experienced signs and symptoms of postsurgical infection but lacked confirmatory laboratory results and were not included in the analysis. This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.

Characteristics of Cases All patients were women, and the median age was 33 years. The median interval from the procedure to symptom onset was 69 days. Patients reported swelling, purulent drainage, redness, or pain at surgical sites. Pharmaceutical treatments for. M. abscessus included oral and intravenous antibiotics with prolonged courses up to 2–6 months. In addition to prescribing medication, health care providers performed incision, drainage, and debridement. Seven patients' wound isolates were available for analysis by the Florida Bureau of Public Health Laboratories. Whole genome sequencing determined that four isolates were closely related †. Clinic A was closed after identification of the cluster; the closure precluded environmental sampling during the investigation.

### Non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections of the skin: a retrospective study of 29 cases [^796a08e4]. The Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The incidence of infections caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria has increased in recent years, due to a rise in dermatological procedures and a greater prevalence of immunosuppression in the general population. This study investigated the clinical and microbiological findings of non-tuberculous mycobacterial skin infections. The study population included 29 patients from whom non-tuberculous mycobacteria were cultured after isolation from skin biopsy materials, cutaneous abscesses or exudates. Clinical, microbiological and epidemiological data were collected from each patient. Eight patients were immunocompromised while 21 were not. Precipitating factors such as acupuncture, filler injection, surgical procedures and other traumatic events preceded infection in 13 (including 11 normal hosts and two immunocompromised hosts) of the 29 patients. Multiple skin lesions were present in eight patients (including three normal hosts and five immunocompromised hosts). In eight patients (including four immunocompromised hosts), symptoms were accompanied by tenosynovitis, osteomyelitis and myositis. Mycobacterium abscessus was isolated from nine patients, Mycobacterium fortuitum was isolated from nine patients, Mycobacterium chelonae was isolated from six patients, Mycobacterium marinum was isolated from two patients, a Mycobacterium avium complex member was isolated from two patients, and Mycobacterium haemophilum was isolated from one patient. Ten of the 24 cases caused by rapidly growing organisms (i.e. M. chelonae, M. abscessus and M. fortuitum groups) were precipitated by skin injuries such as acupuncture, filler infection and other medical procedures. Increases in skin medical procedures, including both acupuncture and esthetic interventions, explain the increasing incidence of these organisms. Immunocompromised patients tended to develop multiple skin lesions and deep tissue infections.

### Validity of diagnosis code-based claims to identify pulmonary NTM disease in bronchiectasis patients [^afd75c76]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infection is an illness of increasing incidence caused by environmental organisms and can lead to chronic pulmonary disease. The accuracy of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes for NTM infection has been evaluated only in limited fashion and is unknown in the context of bronchiectasis, which most patients with pulmonary NTM infection have. We investigated the accuracy of ICD diagnosis codes for NTM infection among Medicare beneficiaries in the United States by using the Bronchiectasis and NTM Research Registry (BRR) as the reference standard.

We identified persons with a diagnosis of bronchiectasis (ICD Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM], codes 494.0 or 494.1) from 2006–2014 Medicare data. BRR is a database of persons with bronchiectasis, NTM infection, or both at 13 US medical institutions. BRR captures clinical data from the 24-month period before enrollment and at annual follow-ups. We matched study participants enrolled at 7 BRR sites to Medicare data. Medicare observation began on the later date of either enrollment or data-start (January 1, 2006) and ended on the earlier date of either coverage-end or data-end (December 31, 2014). We included study participants with an overlap in BRR and Medicare observation, excluding claims or cultures outside this overlap.

We established a primary case definition of an NTM infection as > 1 inpatient discharge or outpatient visit coded 031.0 (pulmonary mycobacterial infection) assigned by a clinician; we also established alternative definitions (Table). For the primary and each alternative case definition, we calculated positive predictive value (PPV) as the proportion of Medicare claim–based NTM infections meeting the BRR case definition + 12 months of the first claim. Sensitivity was calculated as the proportion of patients meeting the BRR case definition who had a claim for NTM infection within + 12 months of meeting that definition. All analyses were performed by using SAS statistical software 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Oregon Health & Science University.

Diagnostic approach for suspected LTBI — principles — states that no definitive diagnostic test for LTBI exists; recommendations for diagnostic testing are based upon the likelihood of infection with Mtb and the likelihood of progression to TB disease if infected; and, given the lack of randomized or observational studies directly comparing diagnostic approaches with clinical outcomes, recommendations are based on evidence about test accuracy combined with evidence that treatment of LTBI improves clinical outcomes.

### Use of diagnosis codes and / or wound culture results for surveillance of surgical site infection after mastectomy and breast reconstruction [^07ade5a9]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2010). Low credibility.

We compared surveillance of surgical site infection (SSI) after major breast surgery by using a combination of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes and microbiology-based surveillance. The sensitivity of the coding algorithm for identification of SSI was 87.5%, and the sensitivity of wound culture for identification of SSI was 78.1%. Our results suggest that SSI surveillance can be reliably performed using claims data.

### Cutaneous infection secondary to botulinum toxin injection: a report of 2 cases [^a054c620]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mycobacterium abscessus is a rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacterium existing extensively in water, soil, and dust that causes infections of skin, soft tissue, respiratory, and central nervous system by direct contact with contaminated material or water. The incidence of cutaneous M abscessus infection has increased in the past decade. Most reported cases were associated with trauma, surgery, or cosmetic procedures, including autologous fat injection, mesotherapy, tattooing, and even hair transplantation. We report 2 cases of M abscessus infection associated with facial injection of botulinum toxin (BTX) in patients who were immunocompetent.
