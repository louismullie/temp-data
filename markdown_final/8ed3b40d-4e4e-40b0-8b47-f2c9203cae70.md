## Question

Recommended time to stop plavix before surgery in 40 year old female with stroke 7 months ago, no residuals, controlled hypertension and diabetes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal timing to discontinue clopidogrel before surgery in a 40-year-old woman who is 7 months post-ischemic stroke with no residual deficits and controlled hypertension and diabetes, currently taking clopidogrel for secondary stroke prevention. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's perioperative thrombotic risk given the timing since stroke. Then, I should evaluate bleeding risk implications of continuing versus stopping clopidogrel. Next, I will review major society guidelines for preoperative interruption intervals for clopidogrel in non-cardiac surgery. After that, I need to consider pharmacology and platelet kinetics to justify the interruption window. Finally, I'll integrate procedure- and patient-specific modifiers, outline a postoperative restart strategy, and confirm any exceptions or emergency considerations.

> Let me first confirm the stroke chronology and its perioperative implications. At 7 months after an ischemic stroke, she is beyond the highest-risk window (< 3–6 months) but still in a moderate-risk period for perioperative major adverse cardiovascular events, with an odds ratio around 3.0 for events when surgery occurs 6–12 months after stroke compared with patients without prior stroke, which informs how cautious I should be about prolonged antiplatelet interruption [^1124u7qP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stopping too early or too late without balancing bleeding versus ischemia. Continuing a P2Y12 inhibitor elevates intra- and postoperative bleeding risk, whereas interruption increases thrombotic risk; randomized and systematic data in non-cardiac surgery underscore that decisions must weigh both domains carefully rather than adopt a one-size-fits-all approach, reinforcing the need for guideline-concordant interruption intervals and early postoperative resumption once hemostasis is secured [^112kQLKd].

> Next, I should review guideline recommendations precisely. Both the ACCP 2022 and ESC 2022 perioperative guidelines advise holding clopidogrel 5 days before elective non-cardiac surgery when interruption is indicated, with multidisciplinary coordination, particularly if there are any coronary devices or high ischemic features, which do not apply here given this is secondary cerebrovascular prevention without recent PCI [^112kdd5a] [^1127kqfJ].

> Hmm, wait a minute — do some high-bleeding-risk procedures require a 7-day hold for clopidogrel? I initially thought so, but let me verify the source details. The ESC 2022 guidance specifies 5 days for clopidogrel and 7 days for prasugrel, not clopidogrel, and while ultra–high bleeding risk procedures (e.g., intracranial, spinal) sometimes prompt even more conservative strategies, the labeled 7-day preoperative hold pertains to prasugrel rather than clopidogrel, so for clopidogrel the evidence-based default remains 5 days unless a neurosurgical team requests a longer hold based on procedural specifics [^1127kqfJ] [^114cBf2E].

> I need to check that the pharmacology supports this window. Clopidogrel irreversibly inhibits platelet P2Y12; recovery of platelet function depends on new platelet generation over 7–10 days, so a 5-day interruption typically restores sufficient aggregation for hemostasis while limiting time off therapy. Regulatory and guideline documents align with 5 days for clopidogrel (and 7 days for prasugrel), and clopidogrel product information flags a 5-day interval before elective CABG, which is consistent mechanistically with the non-cardiac surgery recommendation [^112kdd5a] [^112kdd5a].

> Let me consider patient-specific modifiers. Her younger age (40 years) and absence of residual deficits suggest a comparatively lower bleeding risk and possibly lower short-term thrombotic vulnerability than older stroke cohorts, while diabetes and hypertension, although controlled, still maintain some vascular risk; importantly, bleeding hazards on antiplatelets escalate with age, supporting that at her age the standard 5-day hold is reasonable without needing an extended washout solely for bleeding concerns [^1179S6kS].

> Next, I should review procedure-specific nuances. For truly minor procedures (dental, dermatologic, many ophthalmologic), continuation of antiplatelet therapy can be reasonable, and for certain endoscopic polypectomy settings, uninterrupted clopidogrel did not significantly increase delayed bleeding in a randomized trial; but in the absence of a low-risk procedure designation here, the default for standard elective non-cardiac surgery is to interrupt clopidogrel 5 days preoperatively and resume promptly postoperatively when hemostasis is confirmed [^1125CXGM] [^113jfeaF].

> I will now synthesize the recommendation. Discontinue clopidogrel 5 days before the elective non-cardiac surgery to balance bleeding and thrombotic risks appropriately in this 7-month post-stroke patient without recent coronary stenting, consistent with ACCP and ESC guidance and supported by clopidogrel's irreversible mechanism and platelet turnover kinetics [^112kdd5a] [^1127kqfJ] [^111TNykz].

> I should confirm the postoperative plan. Restart clopidogrel as soon as surgical hemostasis is secured — ideally within 24–48 hours — recognizing ACCP suggests resumption within 24 hours and ESC recommends within 48 hours after interdisciplinary review; routine bridging is not advised for antiplatelets, and routine preoperative platelet function testing is not recommended by ACCP, so I would avoid both unless a specialist team identifies a compelling rationale [^112eka6M] [^111FiAh1] [^117Ccs1H] [^114hY8Jg].

> But wait, what about ongoing perioperative thrombotic vigilance? Even at 6–12 months post-stroke, perioperative MACE risk remains elevated compared with patients without prior stroke, so I would ensure close neurologic and cardiovascular monitoring for 30 days postoperatively and coordinate perioperative decisions among surgery, anesthesia, and neurology teams to mitigate risk and expedite antiplatelet resumption when safe [^1124u7qP] [^111FiAh1].

> Finally, I need to ensure an emergency contingency. If urgent surgery cannot be delayed to allow a full 5-day washout, multidisciplinary planning with anesthesia and surgery should weigh bleeding control strategies; in thienopyridine exposure, platelet transfusion can be considered to restore hemostasis in time-sensitive settings, acknowledging variable effectiveness depending on timing since last dose and recognizing that this is extrapolated from class labeling and broader perioperative experience rather than clopidogrel-specific randomized data [^117LKeNf].

Stop clopidogrel **5 days before elective surgery** [^114hY8Jg] for a 40-year-old woman with a non-cardioembolic stroke 7 months ago, no residual deficits, and controlled hypertension and diabetes, per ACCP and ESC guidelines [^1127kqfJ]. This timing balances bleeding and thrombotic risks [^112kQLKd] because **platelet function recovers by day 5**. For low–bleeding-risk procedures, consider continuing clopidogrel [^1125CXGM]; for high–bleeding-risk surgery, stop it 5 days prior [^111TNykz] and resume within 24–48 hours postoperatively [^112eka6M] once hemostasis is secure [^111FiAh1].

---

## Pharmacology and clinical considerations

Clopidogrel **irreversibly inhibits platelet aggregation** for the lifespan of platelets (7–10 days) [^117LKeNf]; stopping 5 days before surgery [^1127kqfJ] allows platelet function to recover and reduces bleeding risk [^114hY8Jg].

---

## Guidelines and recommendations

ACCP and ESC recommend [^114hY8Jg] stopping clopidogrel **5 days before elective noncardiac surgery** [^1127kqfJ] to balance bleeding and thrombotic risks.

---

## Patient-specific factors

- **Stroke history**: Stroke 7 months ago; risk of recurrence decreases over time but remains elevated [^1124u7qP].
- **Hypertension and diabetes**: Both increase thrombotic risk, but are controlled, reducing overall risk.
- **No residual deficits**: Indicates lower immediate thrombotic risk compared to patients with active neurological deficits.

---

## Surgical procedure considerations

The decision to stop clopidogrel **depends on the type of surgery** [^114pBZSJ]:

| **Surgical procedure** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Low bleeding risk (e.g. minor dental, dermatologic, ophthalmologic) | Consider continuing clopidogrel [^1125CXGM] |
| Moderate to high bleeding risk (e.g. major orthopedic, abdominal, neurosurgery) | Stop clopidogrel 5 days before surgery [^114hY8Jg] [^1127kqfJ] |

---

## Risks associated with discontinuation

Stopping clopidogrel increases **thrombotic risk** [^114JBPXY], including stroke recurrence [^1124u7qP] and myocardial infarction, especially in high-risk patients. However, in this patient the risk is moderate given controlled hypertension and diabetes and the absence of residual deficits.

---

## Risks associated with continuation

Continuing clopidogrel increases **perioperative bleeding risk** [^112kQLKd], potentially leading to complications such as hematoma, transfusion requirements [^112K6RcG], and a prolonged hospital stay.

---

## Balancing risks and benefits

Individualize the decision to **stop clopidogrel**, balancing bleeding and thrombotic risks [^114pBZSJ]. In this patient, stopping it 5 days before surgery is appropriate given her moderate thrombotic risk and the potential for bleeding complications.

---

## Postoperative management

Resume clopidogrel **within 24–48 hours postoperatively** [^112eka6M] once adequate hemostasis is achieved [^111FiAh1].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Stop clopidogrel**: 5 days before elective surgery [^114hY8Jg].
- **Consider continuation**: For low bleeding risk procedures [^1125CXGM].
- **Resume clopidogrel**: Within 24–48 hours postoperatively once hemostasis is achieved [^112eka6M].

---

Stopping clopidogrel **5 days before elective surgery** is recommended for a 40-year-old woman with a stroke 7 months ago, no residual deficits, and controlled hypertension and diabetes [^1127kqfJ]. This approach balances bleeding and thrombotic risks. Clopidogrel should be resumed within 24–48 hours postoperatively once hemostasis is achieved [^111FiAh1].

### Impact of continued clopidogrel use on outcomes of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy [^114DKKkS]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2023). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of clopidogrel at the time of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and its association with postoperative complications.

- **Methods**: Single-institution, retrospective review of a prospective database.

- **Results**: From 2010 to 2017, CEA was performed in 1,066 consecutive patients (median age, 73 years; 66% men). The indications for operation included ≥ 70% asymptomatic stenosis (458; 43%), prior stroke (314; 29%), and transient cerebral or retinal ischemia (294; 28%). At the time of operation, 509 (48%) patients were taking aspirin alone, 441 (41%) were taking clopidogrel (374 in combination with aspirin, 67 as sole therapy), 83 (8%) were on no documented antiplatelet medication, and 33 (3%) were taking warfarin (with therapeutic international normalized ratio). The likelihood of clopidogrel use at the time of operation was higher for patients with a history of symptomatic carotid disease (P = 0.002). Over the study period, clopidogrel use increased from 31.9% in 2010 to 56.8% in 2017, corresponding to an 11% (95% confidence interval, 6%-15%) increase annually. Postoperative strokes occurred in 15 patients (overall incidence, 1.4%), the majority of which were minor (12/15; 80%). Six strokes occurred in patients taking aspirin alone (6/509; 1.2%), two in patients on clopidogrel and aspirin (2/441; 0.5%), two in patients taking clopidogrel alone (2/67; 2.9%), three in patients on no documented antiplatelet medication (3/83; 3.6%), and two in those taking warfarin, one of which was secondary to a fatal intracranial hemorrhage.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy up to the time of non-elective coronary artery bypass grafting with prophylactic platelet transfusion: Is it safe [^113XBnUr]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Guidelines suggest that patients discontinue Clopidogrel at least five days prior to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Those with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are at high risk for myocardial infarction (MI) if not treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). We sought to assess pre- and post-operative outcomes of patients maintained on Clopidogrel and aspirin up to the time of surgery and compare them with those on aspirin alone.

- **Methods**: From the cardiac surgery database, 240 patients were retrospectively registered between January and May 2017. There were 126 patients with ACS who underwent CABG on DAPT (Clopidogrel group [CG]) and 114 patients who underwent elective CABG on aspirin alone (control). The CG received intraoperative prophylactic platelet transfusion (PPT). Demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory data were prospectively entered at the time of surgery and were subsequently retrieved for analysis. Peri- and postoperative findings were identified and compared between both groups.

- **Results**: The cohort consisted of 240 patients (mean age 61 years, 81.3% were male, SD ± 9.58). Patients in the CG were younger (Median 57 vs. 63, P-value 0.001) and showed male predominance (86% versus 75%, P-value 0.028). Additionally, they had a lower prevalence of diabetes and renal failure compared to controls (P-values 0.003 and 0.005, respectively). There were no significant differences between both groups in the number of vessels grafted, duration of on-pump and aortic clamp usage. Hematologic laboratory data also had similar baseline values. The CG exhibited a similar bleeding rate.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to female patients (secondary prevention), the AHA/ASA 2014 guidelines recommend initiating clopidogrel if a high-risk (10-year predicted CVD risk ≥ 10%) female has an indication for aspirin but is intolerant of aspirin therapy.

### Prasugrel [^117LKeNf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Thienopyridines inhibit platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet (7 to 10 days), so withholding a dose will not be useful in managing a bleeding event or the risk of bleeding associated with an invasive procedure. Because the half-life of prasugrel's active metabolite is short relative to the lifetime of the platelet, it may be possible to restore hemostasis by administering exogenous platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 6 hours of the loading dose or 4 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective.

- **Coronary artery bypass graft surgery-related bleeding**: The risk of bleeding is increased in patients receiving prasugrel who undergo CABG. If possible, prasugrel should be discontinued at least 7 days prior to CABG.

	- Of the 437 patients who underwent CABG during TRITON-TIMI 38, the rates of CABG-related TIMI major or minor bleeding were 14.1% in the prasugrel group and 4.5% in the clopidogrel group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The higher risk for bleeding events in patients treated with prasugrel persisted up to 7 days from the most recent dose of the study drug. For patients receiving a thienopyridine within 3 days prior to CABG, the frequencies of TIMI major or minor bleeding were 26.7% (12 of 45 patients) in the prasugrel group, compared with 5.0% (3 of 60 patients) in the clopidogrel group. For patients who received their last dose of thienopyridine within 4 to 7 days prior to CABG, the frequencies decreased to 11.3% (9 of 80 patients) in the prasugrel group and 3.4% (3 of 89 patients) in the clopidogrel group.

### Age-specific risks, severity, time course, and outcome of bleeding on long-term antiplatelet treatment after vascular events: A population-based cohort study [^116L4K9q]. Lancet (2017). Low credibility.

Roughly 40–66% of adults aged 75 years or older in the United States and Europe take daily aspirin or other antiplatelet drugs, about half for secondary prevention of vascular disease, consistent with guideline recommendations for lifelong treatment. Antiplatelet drugs increase the risk of major bleeding, particularly upper gastrointestinal bleeds, but this risk is reduced by 70–90% by proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs; trials are summarized in the appendix [p 2]). However, co-prescription of PPIs is not routine because of concerns about adverse effects and perhaps because upper gastrointestinal bleeds had a low case fatality in trials of aspirin and are not generally thought to cause permanent disability. Clinical guidelines on secondary prevention of vascular events make no recommendations on PPI use, and although some consensus statements advocate use of these drugs in high-risk patients, definitions of high risk vary and uptake in practice remains low.

- **Research in context**:

	- **Evidence before this study**: Lifelong antiplatelet treatment is recommended after ischemic vascular events on the basis of trials done at younger ages (mainly < 75 years). Bleeding is a serious complication but is most commonly upper gastrointestinal, which has had low case fatality in previous trials and is not generally thought to cause long-term disability. Consequently, although proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce upper gastrointestinal bleeds by 70–90%, uptake in clinical practice is low and guidelines on secondary prevention of vascular events make no recommendations on PPI use.

### Continuation versus discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy for bleeding and ischaemic events in adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery [^112kQLKd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet agents are recommended for people with myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, transient ischaemic attack or stroke, and for those with coronary stents. Individuals taking antiplatelet agents face an increased risk of adverse events during non-cardiac surgery because of these indications. However, the continued use of antiplatelet therapy during surgery raises the risk of bleeding. Discontinuing antiplatelet therapy before surgery might reduce the risk of bleeding but may increase the likelihood of thrombotic events such as myocardial infarction.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effects of continuing versus discontinuing antiplatelet therapy for at least five days on the occurrence of bleeding and ischaemic events in adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery under general, spinal, or regional anaesthesia.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to January 2018), and Embase (1974 to January 2018). We also searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials of adults on single or dual antiplatelet therapy for at least two weeks, scheduled for elective non-cardiac surgery, and with at least one cardiac risk factor. We planned to include quasi-randomized studies but excluded people scheduled for minor surgeries under local anaesthesia.

### Executive summary: Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: An American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^117Ccs1H]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for perioperative cardiac risk in noncardiac surgery, specifically concerning the management of antiplatelets, the ACCP 2022 guidelines recommend avoiding routine platelet function testing before surgery or procedures. This guidance is intended to inform perioperative antiplatelet management in patients who are receiving antiplatelet drug therapy and undergoing elective surgery or procedures.

### Perioperative management of patients on chronic antithrombotic therapy [^111Ca7gi]. Hematology, American Society of Hematology, Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy is a frequently occurring situation that requires careful consideration of the patient, the procedure, and an expanding array of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents. Preoperative assessment must address each patient's risk for thromboembolic events, balanced against the risk for perioperative bleeding. Procedures can be separated into those with a low bleeding risk, which generally do not require complete reversal of the antithrombotic therapy, and those associated with an intermediate or high bleeding risk.

For patients receiving warfarin who need interruption of the anticoagulant, consideration must be given to whether simply withholding the anticoagulant is optimal or whether a perioperative "bridge" with an alternative agent, typically a low-molecular-weight heparin, should be used. New oral anticoagulants, such as dabigatran and rivaroxaban, have shorter effective half-lives but introduce other concerns for perioperative management, including prolonged drug effects in patients with renal insufficiency, limited experience with clinical laboratory testing to confirm the lack of residual anticoagulant effect, and lack of a reversal agent.

Antiplatelet agents must also be considered in the perioperative setting, with particular attention given to the potential risk for thrombotic complications in patients with coronary artery stents who have antiplatelet therapy withheld.

### Perioperative antiplatelet therapy [^117SDGxQ]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Aspirin is recommended as a lifelong therapy that should never be interrupted for patients with cardiovascular disease. Clopidogrel therapy is mandatory for six weeks after the placement of bare-metal stents, three to six months following a myocardial infarction, and at least 12 months after the placement of drug-eluting stents. Due to the hypercoagulable state induced by surgery, early withdrawal of antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease increases the risk of postoperative myocardial infarction and death five- to ten-fold in stented patients who are on continuous dual antiplatelet therapy. The shorter the time between revascularization and surgery, the higher the risk of adverse cardiac events.

Elective surgery should be postponed beyond these periods, whereas vital, semi-urgent, or urgent operations should be performed under continued dual antiplatelet therapy. The risk of surgical hemorrhage is increased by approximately 20 percent with aspirin or clopidogrel alone, and 50 percent with dual antiplatelet therapy. Current clinical data suggest that the risk of a cardiovascular event when stopping antiplatelet agents preoperatively is higher than the risk of surgical bleeding when continuing these drugs, except during surgery in a closed space (e.g. intracranial, posterior eye chamber) or surgeries associated with massive bleeding and difficult hemostasis.

### Impact of prior use or recent withdrawal of oral antiplatelet agents on acute coronary syndromes [^114JBPXY]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Oral antiplatelet agents (OAAs) can prevent further vascular events in cardiovascular disease. How prior use or recent discontinuation of OAA affects the clinical presentation of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and clinical outcomes, such as death and myocardial infarction (MI), is unclear.

- **Methods and results**: We studied and followed a cohort of 1358 consecutive patients admitted for a suspected ACS for up to 30 days. Of these patients, 930 were nonusers, 355 were prior users of OAA, and 73 had recently withdrawn from OAA. Nonusers were at lower risk, more frequently presented with ST-elevation MI on admission, and more frequently had Q-wave MI at discharge than prior users (36.6% versus 17.5%, P < 0.001; and 47.8% versus 28.2%, P < 0.001, respectively). However, there was no difference regarding the incidence of death or MI at 30 days between nonusers and prior users (10.3% versus 12.4%, P = NS). In addition, prior users experienced more major bleeds within 30 days compared with nonusers (3.4% versus 1.4%, respectively; P = 0.04).

Recent withdrawers were admitted on average 11.9 ± 0.8 days after OAA withdrawal. Interruption was primarily a physician's decision for scheduled surgery (n = 47 of 73). Despite a similar cardiovascular risk profile, recent withdrawers had higher 30-day rates of death or MI (21.9% versus 12.4%, P = 0.04) and bleedings (13.7% versus 5.9%, P = 0.03) than prior users. After multivariate analysis, OAA withdrawal was found to be an independent predictor of both mortality and bleedings at 30 days.

- **Conclusions**: Among ACS patients, prior users represent a higher-risk population and…

### Executive summary: Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: An American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^116NB7Qk]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for perioperative cardiac risk in noncardiac surgery, particularly concerning the management of antiplatelets, the ACCP 2022 guidelines recommend considering either the continuation of both antiplatelet agents or the interruption of one antiplatelet agent within 7–10 days of surgery. This recommendation applies to patients on aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitor therapy who have had coronary stents placed within the last 6–12 weeks and are undergoing elective surgery or procedures.

### Personalizing antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel [^112WG6cb]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is the accepted standard for the prevention of ischemic complications following percutaneous coronary intervention, and it has been demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACSs). There is substantial interindividual variability in the antiplatelet response to clopidogrel. Various clinical studies have indicated that patients with high on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity are at an increased risk for ischemic events. In recent years, several clinical and demographic variables, along with multiple genetic factors contributing to the variability in the antiplatelet response to clopidogrel, have been identified.

Strategies based on platelet function testing or genotyping are discussed to improve the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel and thereby enhance clinical outcomes.

### Superiority of clopidogrel versus aspirin in patients with prior cardiac surgery [^116N23jE]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

After coronary artery bypass surgery, patients have a high cumulative rate of graft closure and re-ischemic events. We sought to determine whether antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel would be more effective than aspirin, the accepted standard, in these patients.

- **Methods and results**: The event rates for all-cause mortality, vascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and rehospitalization were determined for the 1,480 patients with a history of cardiac surgery randomized to either clopidogrel or aspirin in a trial of 19,185 patients. The event rate per year of vascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or rehospitalization was 22.3% in the 705 patients randomized to aspirin and 15.9% in the 775 patients randomized to clopidogrel (P = 0.001). A risk reduction was also seen in each of the individual endpoints examined, including a 42.8% relative risk reduction in vascular death in patients on clopidogrel versus aspirin (P = 0.030). In a multivariate model incorporating baseline clinical characteristics, clopidogrel therapy was independently associated with a decrease in vascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or rehospitalization in patients with a history of cardiac surgery, with a 31.2% relative risk reduction (95% CI, 15.8 to 43.8; P = 0.0003). Although clopidogrel therapy was efficacious in the entire Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events (CAPRIE) population, multivariate analysis demonstrated that patients with previous cardiac surgery derived particular benefit (P = 0.015).

Concluding, compared with aspirin, clopidogrel demonstrates a notable advantage in reducing vascular events in patients who have undergone cardiac surgery.

The clinical evidence regarding the influence of a tailored antiplatelet strategy on adverse outcomes has been controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the significance of tailored antiplatelet therapy concerning clinical adverse events in antiplatelet-resistant patients.

- **Methods**: Randomized studies assessing the clinical relevance of personalized antiplatelet treatment in antiplatelet-resistant patients were identified through a literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. The primary endpoint was the composite of death from any cause and stent thrombosis. All total clinical adverse events and bleeding complications were evaluated.

- **Results**: Data were combined across seven randomized studies comprising 12,048 subjects, of whom 3,738 (31.0%) were found to be antiplatelet-resistant. Antiplatelet-resistant patients provided with tailored antiplatelet therapy showed a lower risk of death or stent thrombosis than those assigned conventional antiplatelet treatment (0.5% vs. 2.2%; OR (95% CI) 0.25 (0.13 to 0.49), p < 0.0001). A significant benefit in terms of total adverse event risk reduction was observed during follow-up for tailored versus conventional antiplatelet therapy (5.5% vs. 10.0%; OR (95% CI) 0.40 (0.20 to 0.77), p = 0.006). No statistical difference in bleeding complications was observed between these two groups (p = 0.08).

- **Conclusions**: Personalized antiplatelet treatment for antiplatelet resistance was found to be associated with a lower occurrence of death or stent thrombosis and a reduced risk of total clinical adverse events.

### Age-dependent effect of ticagrelor monotherapy versus ticagrelor with aspirin on major bleeding and cardiovascular events: A post hoc analysis of the TICO randomized trial [^111mtYUy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Although it remains uncertain which single antiplatelet therapy is most effective and safe after short-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), short-term DAPT followed by aspirin monotherapy had a higher incidence of myocardial infarction, driven by a surge of events just after DAPT cessation, as indicated in the SMART-DATE trial (6-versus 12-month or longer dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with acute coronary syndrome) among patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

In the STOPDAPT-2 trial (Short and optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after everolimus-eluting cobalt-chromium stent), clopidogrel monotherapy after short-term DAPT increased the tendency for myocardial infarction, although not statistically significant. The decreased response to clopidogrel after short-term DAPT was attributable to genetic polymorphisms, particularly in patients with ACS. Meanwhile, ticagrelor has superior pharmacodynamic effects over clopidogrel, irrespective of genotype differences.

Recent trials have shown that ticagrelor monotherapy after short-term DAPT improves bleeding outcomes without increasing the risk of ischemic events following DAPT termination. Therefore, potent P2Y12 inhibitor-based monotherapy after short-term DAPT may be a good option for patients with ACS and a high bleeding risk, such as elderly patients, without raising bleeding and ischemic risks.

### Prasugrel [^114Crd2J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **General risk of bleeding**: Thienopyridines, including prasugrel, increase the risk of bleeding. With the dosing regimens used in the TRITON-TIMI 38 study, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) major events (clinically overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin ≥ 5 g/dL, or intracranial hemorrhage) and TIMI minor events (overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin of ≥ 3 g/dL but < 5 g/dL) were more common on prasugrel than on clopidogrel [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The bleeding risk is highest initially, as shown in Figure 1, which presents events through 450 days, with an inset showing events through 7 days.

	- **Figure 1**: Non-CABG-related TIMI major or minor bleeding events.

	- Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, PCI, CABG, or other surgical procedures, even if the patient does not have overt signs of bleeding. Do not use prasugrel in patients with active bleeding or a prior TIA or stroke [see Contraindications (4.1, 4.2)].

	- **Other risk factors for bleeding**:
		- **Age ≥ 75 years**: Because of the risk of bleeding (including fatal bleeding) and uncertain effectiveness in patients ≥ 75 years of age, use of prasugrel is generally not recommended in these patients, except in high-risk situations (patients with diabetes or a history of myocardial infarction) where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14)].
		- CABG or other surgical procedures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
		- **Body weight**: (content missing here, considered as continuation of previous point).

### Expert position paper on the management of antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^111BmDn8]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

The risks and benefits of preoperative exposure to antiplatelet therapy, particularly aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA), are an important consideration for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. ASA is recommended as a secondary prevention therapy for all patients with proven coronary artery disease (CAD) and without contraindications. Its indication is even stronger for post-CABG patients (recommendation IA). The general consensus is that ASA treatment withdrawal has ominous prognostic implications in CAD patients, especially those with intracoronary stents. It should be pursued only when the bleeding risk clearly outweighs that of atherothrombotic events.

- **Benefits of preoperative aspirin**: The continuation of ASA until the day of CABG ('preoperative ASA') remains a debated practice. Variability in guidelines from different professional societies reflects the unclear benefits. Traditionally, ASA started the day before surgery showed no more efficacy than ASA started 6 hours post-surgery in improving early graft patency (7- to 10-day) but was linked to increased bleeding complications. However, more recent evidence indicates that ASA use within 5–7 days prior to CABG halves mortality without significantly increasing hemorrhage, blood product requirements, or related morbidities, and reduces late infarction and repeat revascularization. Retrospective data consistently highlight the benefit of preoperative aspirin within 5 days of surgery, including a reduction in cerebrovascular events and 30-day mortality.

### Management of surgical patients receiving anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents [^113k8yRZ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Temporary interruption of long-term anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy during surgical procedures exposes patients to thrombotic risk. The continuation of these agents, however, is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Managing anticoagulation can be particularly challenging in emergency settings.

- **Methods**: A literature review of published articles was undertaken using the keywords heparin, warfarin, perioperative, antiplatelet, aspirin, and surgery. A management plan for all likely situations was developed.

- **Results and conclusion**: Based on an individual assessment of risk factors for arterial or venous thromboembolism and the risk of perioperative bleeding, it is possible to form an anticoagulant and antiplatelet management plan likely to achieve a low incidence of bleeding and thrombosis. A multidisciplinary approach is desirable.

### Should clopidogrel be discontinued before coronary artery bypass grafting for patients with acute coronary syndrome? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111myUQu]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether clopidogrel should be discontinued before coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Patients presenting with ACS are typically treated with dual antiplatelet therapy, including aspirin and clopidogrel, to reduce mortality and prevent re-ischemia. However, those requiring CABG may face increased postoperative bleeding and bleeding-related adverse outcomes. Clinical management guidelines vary widely. This meta-analysis examined the evidence regarding the use of clopidogrel in patients with ACS who require CABG, specifically focusing on the timing of medication cessation before surgery.

A systematic review of nine electronic databases was conducted to identify relevant studies with comparable outcomes for patients with ACS treated with clopidogrel before undergoing CABG. The endpoints considered were reoperation, major bleeding, mortality, and a composite endpoint of mortality and re-myocardial infarction.

Five relevant studies were identified according to the predefined selection criteria. It was found that patients who received clopidogrel had a significantly lower incidence of composite endpoints than those who did not receive it. However, this was influenced by the timing of CABG in relation to clopidogrel cessation.

In conclusion, the results from this meta-analysis suggest that patients with ACS should be treated with dual antiplatelet therapy, including clopidogrel. However, for patients subsequently referred for CABG, the timing of clopidogrel cessation is crucial to minimize adverse bleeding events and optimize outcomes.

### Expert position paper on the management of antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^116LRinb]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Coronary artery bypass grafting-related risk on Clopidogrel: Clopidogrel is a second-generation thienopyridine characterized by large interindividual variability in pharmacodynamic response, which significantly impacts clinical outcomes. This variability arises because clopidogrel is a prodrug requiring biotransformation into its active metabolite. Polymorphisms in genes encoding the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, especially CYP2C19, are key factors. Clopidogrel-treated PCI patients carrying genetic variants associated with CYP2C19 loss of function have a three- to six-fold higher risk of stent thrombosis. However, polymorphic variation in CYP2C19 accounts for less than 20% of the response variability with clopidogrel, leaving the variation in its bioactivation largely unexplained. Currently, there is no convincing evidence that genetic testing or functional platelet assays measuring platelet reactivity may improve clinical outcomes in clopidogrel-treated patients undergoing PCI.

- **Observational studies**: Observational studies have demonstrated that the increase in postoperative chest tube drainage, transfusion, reoperation rates, hospitalization stay, and mortality observed when DAPT (aspirin and clopidogrel) is maintained during CABG is reduced when DAPT is stopped 5 days or more before CABG. Shorter windows of clopidogrel interruption have been suggested, but time delay alone does not solely account for the difference in the observed magnitude of clopidogrel's effect on bleeding. Differences in patient response to P2Y12 inhibitors, outcome definitions, transfusion triggers, and use of other medications contribute to variability.

### A randomized controlled trial of platelet activity before and after cessation of clopidogrel therapy in patients with stable cardiovascular disease [^1141i2Ge]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). High credibility.

The aim of this randomized placebo-controlled trial was to determine if withdrawing clopidogrel therapy leads to increased platelet activity compared with pre-treatment values in patients with stable coronary artery or peripheral arterial disease.

Reports of increased cardiovascular events after planned cessation of clopidogrel therapy have raised concerns over the possible existence of a rebound in platelet activity.

In all, 171 patients receiving established aspirin therapy were randomly assigned to placebo or clopidogrel (75 mg daily) for 28 days. Blood samples were taken at pre-treatment baseline, on treatment just before discontinuation of study drug, and on days 7, 14, and 28 after discontinuation. The primary outcome measure was adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-stimulated platelet fibrinogen binding. Six secondary outcomes were assessed: ADP-stimulated platelet P-selectin, unstimulated platelet fibrinogen binding, and light transmission aggregometry with ADP 5 and 10 μmol/l recorded at maximum and at 6 min.

The ADP-stimulated platelet fibrinogen binding, P-selectin expression, and platelet aggregation were lower on treatment with clopidogrel compared with baseline (p 0.05). Furthermore, there was no evidence of an interaction between platelet inhibition over time and treatment allocation.

### Age-specific risks, severity, time course, and outcome of bleeding on long-term antiplatelet treatment after vascular events: a population-based cohort study [^114S4K7T]. Lancet (2017). Low credibility.

We conducted a population-based cohort study involving consecutive patients who, for the first time during the study period, experienced an acute transient ischaemic attack, ischaemic stroke, or myocardial infarction, and were treated with antiplatelet drugs — either newly started or continued. This research was part of the Oxford Vascular Study (OXVASC) from 2002 to 2012, with follow-up extending until 2013. OXVASC is a comprehensive study focusing on the incidence and outcomes of all acute vascular events in a population of 92,728 individuals of varying ages, registered with 100 general practitioners across nine general practices in Oxfordshire, UK. Detailed definitions of vascular events and the various overlapping methodologies used to achieve nearly complete ascertainment of all individuals with transient ischaemic attack, stroke, or myocardial infarction are provided in the appendix (pp 34, 35) and have been previously reported.

Patients who started or continued oral anticoagulants after an event were excluded from the study. However, those who were on premorbid oral anticoagulants and were switched to antiplatelet therapy post-event were included. Patients initiating anticoagulation during subsequent follow-up were censored at the time of starting permanent anticoagulation. We excluded those not prescribed antithrombotic drugs due to recent bleeding, coagulation disorders, known allergies, other existing bleeding tendencies, or a decision for palliative care only. Written informed consent or assent from relatives was obtained from all participants, and the OXVASC study received approval from the local ethics committee.

### Ticlopidine hydrochloride [^1171S4vY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016). Low credibility.

Ticlopidine should be used with caution in patients who may be at risk of increased bleeding from trauma, surgery, or pathological conditions. If it is desired to eliminate the antiplatelet effects of ticlopidine prior to elective surgery, the drug should be discontinued 10 to 14 days before surgery. Several controlled clinical studies have found increased surgical blood loss in patients undergoing surgery during treatment with ticlopidine. In TASS and CATS, it was recommended that patients have ticlopidine discontinued prior to elective surgery. Several hundred patients underwent surgery during the trials, and no excessive surgical bleeding was reported.

Prolonged bleeding time is normalized within 2 hours after administration of 20 mg methylprednisolone IV. Platelet transfusions may also be used to reverse the effect of ticlopidine on bleeding. Because platelet transfusions may accelerate thrombosis in patients with TTP on ticlopidine, they should, if possible, be avoided.

- **GI bleeding**: Ticlopidine prolongs template bleeding time. The drug should be used with caution in patients who have lesions with a propensity to bleed (such as ulcers). Drugs that might induce such lesions should be used with caution in patients on ticlopidine.

- **Use in hepatically impaired patients**: Since ticlopidine is metabolized by the liver, dosing of ticlopidine or other drugs metabolized in the liver may require adjustment upon starting or stopping concomitant therapy. Because of limited experience in patients with severe hepatic disease, who may have bleeding di

### Is there a role for preoperative platelet function testing in patients undergoing cardiac surgery during antiplatelet therapy [^115eKWSe]? Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Up to 11% of patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes undergo coronary artery bypass grafting. Guidelines largely recommend a one-size-fits-all preoperative discontinuation period for P2Y12 receptor blockers to avoid bleeding. These recommendations do not account for highly variable pharmacodynamic responsiveness and variable recovery of platelet reactivity following discontinuation of P2Y12 receptor blockers. Several observational studies have demonstrated that an objective measurement of platelet function among these patients may reduce the waiting period while mitigating the risk of bleeding. Based on these findings, two recent guidelines included a Class IIa and IIb recommendation for platelet function testing in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

The following review article describes:

- **Rationale**: For discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy before cardiac surgery and the limitations with this approach.
- **Available platelet function assays**: To assess pharmacodynamic effects.
- **Association between platelet inhibition, other clinical factors, and surgery-related bleeding**: This information will assist the reader in determining which patients undergoing cardiac surgery might benefit from preoperative platelet function monitoring.

This comprehensive review aids in the evaluation of whether preoperative platelet function monitoring could benefit certain patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

### Prasugrel [^111nCSsd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Warning: Bleeding risk**: See full prescribing information for the complete boxed warning.

Prasugrel can cause significant, sometimes fatal, bleeding. Do not use prasugrel in patients with active pathological bleeding or a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke. In patients aged 75 years and older, prasugrel is generally not recommended, except in high-risk patients, such as those with diabetes or prior myocardial infarction (MI), where its use may be considered.

Do not start prasugrel in patients likely to undergo urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). When possible, discontinue prasugrel at least 7 days prior to any surgery. Additional risk factors for bleeding include body weight less than 60 kg, a propensity to bleed, and the concomitant use of medications that increase the risk of bleeding.

Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone invasive or surgical procedures. If possible, manage bleeding without discontinuing prasugrel, as stopping prasugrel increases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events.

### Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines for management of extracranial cerebrovascular disease [^111TsPtw]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Management of carotid bifurcation stenosis in stroke prevention has been the subject of extensive investigations, including multiple randomized controlled trials. The proper treatment of patients with carotid bifurcation disease is of major interest to vascular surgeons and other vascular specialists. In 2011, the Society for Vascular Surgery published guidelines for the treatment of carotid artery disease. At the time, several randomized trials comparing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS) were reported. Since the 2011 guidelines, several studies and a few systematic reviews comparing CEA and CAS have been reported, and the role of medical management has been reemphasized.

In the present publication, we have updated and expanded on the 2011 guidelines with specific emphasis on five areas: (1) Is CEA recommended over maximal medical therapy for low-risk patients; (2) Is CEA recommended over transfemoral CAS for low surgical risk patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis of > 50%; (3) The timing of carotid intervention for patients presenting with acute stroke; (4) Screening for carotid artery stenosis in asymptomatic patients; and (5) The optimal sequence of intervention for patients with combined carotid and coronary artery disease.

A separate implementation document will address other important clinical issues in extracranial cerebrovascular disease. Recommendations are made using the GRADE (grades of recommendation assessment, development, and evaluation) approach, as was used for other Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines.

### Balancing the benefit and risk of oral antiplatelet agents in coronary artery bypass surgery [^111j428c]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Concern about possible hemorrhagic complications arising from the use of oral antiplatelet agents in immediate proximity to coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery leads many clinicians to avoid or discontinue these agents preoperatively. Recent evidence suggests that aspirin and clopidogrel can be used with relative safety in the preoperative period; dual antiplatelet therapy in the 5 days immediately preceding CABG surgery results in a moderate and variable increase in the risk of procedural bleeding. This modest hemorrhagic risk may be acceptable, given the clinical benefits of sustained antiplatelet therapy in preventing graft occlusion and ischemic complications pre- and post-CABG. Because the bleeding risk with aspirin is dose dependent, the use of a low dose is preferred post-CABG.

### Antithrombotic dilemmas in stroke medicine: New data, unsolved challenges [^112zLouk]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Low credibility.

Antithrombotic therapy is a key element of secondary prevention in patients who have had an ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack. However, its use in clinical practice is not always straightforward. This review provides an update on certain difficult scenarios in antithrombotic management, with a focus on recent clinical trials and large observational studies.

- **Patients with clinical or radiological evidence of previous intracranial bleeding**: We discuss the approach to patients with an indication for antithrombotic treatment who also have clinical or radiological evidence of previous intracranial bleeding.

- **Indications for both anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatment**: We examine patients with indications for both anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatment.

- **Failure in antithrombotic treatment to prevent stroke**: We address situations where antithrombotic treatment fails to prevent stroke.

- **Timing of anticoagulation initiation after cardioembolic stroke**: We review the timing of anticoagulation initiation after cardioembolic stroke.

- **Use of antithrombotics in patients with asymptomatic cerebrovascular disease**: The use of antithrombotics in patients with asymptomatic cerebrovascular disease is also discussed.

Despite a wealth of new evidence, numerous uncertainties remain, and we highlight ongoing trials addressing these issues.

### Balancing the risks and benefits of long-term antiplatelet therapies for cardiovascular disease: Clinical, research, and regulatory implications [^113nRWhY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Balancing the risks and benefits with combinations of antiplatelet therapies for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease is an evolving and challenging conundrum. Although treatment regimens with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and those with vorapaxar plus aspirin, or vorapaxar plus DAPT, have been shown to reduce ischemic events, there has been a consistent increase in major bleeding events with additional and/or intensified antiplatelet agents beyond aspirin as a cornerstone therapy. Major bleeding events are clearly associated with a higher risk of mortality and other ischemic events; however, the mechanisms behind this association are complex and likely related to multiple factors, including patient comorbidities that track with bleeding risk (e.g. advanced age, renal insufficiency), adverse consequences of premature discontinuation of antiplatelet agents following a major bleeding event, and residual confounding.

Patients with prior stroke are an especially vulnerable group because they are at a disproportionately increased risk of bleeding, specifically intracranial hemorrhage, if treated with intensified antiplatelet therapy or combinations of antiplatelet agents. The ACC/AHA non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome practice guidelines provide a glimpse into the challenging nature of decision-making for individual patients by designating a class IIaC recommendation for shorter durations of DAPT following stent implantation (< 12 months) if the perceived risks of morbidity associated with bleeding outweigh the potential benefits of the recommended 12 months of DAPT.

### Is clopidogrel stopped prior to hip fracture surgery — A survey of current practice in the United Kingdom [^1171xgLF]. Injury (2007). Low credibility.

Clopidogrel is an anti-platelet agent that causes an increase in bleeding time. An increasing number of patients presenting with an acute femoral neck fracture take clopidogrel in combination with other anti-platelet agents as regular prescription medication. These patients may be at higher risk of increased peri-operative bleeding. Currently, no guidelines or recommendations exist regarding the routine discontinuation of clopidogrel in patients with a fracture of the femoral neck awaiting surgery.

- **Methods**: A telephone questionnaire was undertaken to examine the practice among 110 orthopaedic departments in the UK regarding the discontinuation of clopidogrel prior to trauma surgery for femoral neck fractures. This was compared to the practice of discontinuing aspirin and warfarin in the same patient groups in these departments.

- **Results**: There appears to be significant variation in practice among orthopaedic departments, with 43.6% having a policy of discontinuing clopidogrel. This compares to 37.3% of trusts having a policy of stopping aspirin and 97.3% stopping warfarin.

- **Conclusion**: There is wide variation in practice regarding the discontinuation of clopidogrel preoperatively in patients due to undergo surgery for femoral neck fractures. These findings highlight the need to develop guidelines for the preoperative management of these patients.

### Perioperative management of patients on chronic antithrombotic therapy [^114pBZSJ]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy is a situation that occurs frequently and requires consideration of the patient, the procedure, and an expanding array of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents. Preoperative assessment must address each patient's risk for thromboembolic events balanced against the risk for perioperative bleeding. Procedures can be separated into those with a low bleeding risk, which generally do not require complete reversal of the antithrombotic therapy, and those associated with an intermediate or high bleeding risk.

For patients who are receiving warfarin and need interruption of the anticoagulant, consideration must be given to whether simply withholding the anticoagulant is the optimal approach or whether a perioperative "bridge" with an alternative agent, typically a low-molecular-weight heparin, should be used. The new oral anticoagulants, dabigatran and rivaroxaban, have shorter effective half-lives. However, they introduce other concerns for perioperative management, including prolonged drug effect in patients with renal insufficiency, limited experience with clinical laboratory testing to confirm lack of residual anticoagulant effect, and lack of a reversal agent.

Antiplatelet agents must also be considered in the perioperative setting, with particular attention given to the potential risk for thrombotic complications in patients with coronary artery stents who have antiplatelet therapy withheld.

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for preventing cardiovascular events [^117JHWpt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Aspirin is the prophylactic antiplatelet drug of choice for people with cardiovascular disease. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may provide additional benefits for people at high risk and those with established cardiovascular disease. This is an update to a previously published review from 2011.

- **Objectives**: To review the benefit and harm of adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy for preventing cardiovascular events in individuals who have coronary disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or are at high risk of atherothrombotic disease, but do not have a coronary stent.

- **Search methods**: We updated the searches of CENTRAL (2017, Issue 6), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 4 July 2017), and Embase (Ovid, 1947 to 3 July 2017) on 4 July 2017. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP portal and hand-searched reference lists. No language restrictions were applied.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized controlled trials comparing over 30 days use of aspirin plus clopidogrel with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone in people with coronary disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or at high risk of atherothrombotic disease. We excluded studies that included only individuals with coronary drug-eluting stent (DES) or non-DES, or both.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We collected data on mortality from cardiovascular causes, all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal ischaemic stroke, and major and minor bleeding. The overall treatment effect was estimated by the p-value.

### The use of clopidogrel in carotid endarterectomy: an audit of current practice [^112G64EA]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Clopidogrel is commonly encountered in patients presenting for carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Its use around this time is controversial, and there is no randomized controlled trial data to determine the best practice. Questionnaires were posted to all members of the Vascular Society investigating clopidogrel use at the time of CEA.

- **Survey results**: 52% discontinue clopidogrel preoperatively; 51% of those use no alternative, and 49% replace it with aspirin. Clopidogrel use is not related to the number of endarterectomies performed by each surgeon.

There is no consensus on clopidogrel use during CEA, highlighting the need for quality prospective data on this subject.

### Consensus decision-making for the management of antiplatelet therapy before non-cardiac surgery in patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with second-generation drug-eluting stents: A cohort study [^112Z2LNv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

We previously demonstrated that discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy (APT) did not impact both ischemic and bleeding outcomes after non-cardiac surgery (NCS) unless it was inappropriately prolonged. The POISE-2 (Perioperative Ischaemic Evaluation-2) study is a randomized controlled trial that evaluated the effect of aspirin compared with a placebo in 10,000 patients undergoing NCS. Although the main study findings showed that aspirin increases the risk of major bleeding without significantly lowering ischemic events, a subgroup analysis in patients with prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) suggested that aspirin may reduce the risk of death or myocardial infarction by half, without a significant impact on major bleeding.

These findings imply that the benefit of APT may be determined by the balance among ischemic-bleeding risks. The sub-study of POISE-2 included more than half of the patients treated with bare-metal stents and only 25% of patients treated with drug-eluting stents (DES). Considering the lower risk of stent thrombosis with the second-generation DES compared to bare-metal stents and first-generation DES, it is uncertain whether the modest thrombotic risk associated with the second-generation DES would be significantly altered by the unconditional use of an antiplatelet agent.

It should also be noted that about 50% of patients with prior PCI in the POISE-2 study were not receiving any APT seven days or less before NCS. These patients could be at a higher risk of cardiac events because they would discontinue APT for an additional seven days after surgery if they were assigned to take a placebo. In contrast, we recommend…

Antiplatelet agents are considered to be the cornerstone for secondary prevention of stroke, but the role of using multiple antiplatelet agents early after stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) to improve outcomes has not been established.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness and safety of initiating, within 72 hours after an ischaemic stroke or TIA, multiple antiplatelet agents versus fewer antiplatelet agents to prevent stroke recurrence. The analysis explores the evidence for different drug combinations.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 6 July 2020), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 7 of 12, 2020) (last searched 6 July 2020), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946 to 6 July 2020), Embase (1980 to 6 July 2020), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP. We also searched the reference lists of identified studies and reviews and used the Science Citation Index Cited Reference search for forward tracking of included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of multiple versus fewer antiplatelet agents initiated within 72 hours after stroke or TIA.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted data from eligible studies for the primary outcomes of stroke recurrence and vascular death, and secondary outcomes of myocardial infarction; composite outcome of stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death; intracranial haemorrhage; and extracranial haemorrhage.

### Effects of aspirin on risk and severity of early recurrent stroke after transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke: time-course analysis of randomised trials [^114UY3bb]. Lancet (2016). Low credibility.

Aspirin also reduced the severity of recurrent ischaemic stroke during the 6 weeks after randomisation, with a similar effect seen at 12 weeks and when analyses were based only on an mRS score higher than 2. Consequently, aspirin reduced the 6-week risk of disabling or fatal (mRS score > 2) ischaemic stroke by about 70% and the risk of very severe (mRS score 4–6) ischaemic stroke by about 75% (26 of 8,452 participants in the active group had an event vs 92 of 7,326 in the control group; HR 0.25, 0.16–0.39, p < 0.0001), but had less effect on non-disabling (mRS ≤ 2) stroke (48 of 8,452 participants had an event vs 65 of 7,326; HR 0.64, 0.44–0.93, p = 0.020). The benefit continued to accrue for the risk of disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke up to 12 weeks follow-up, but the greatest reduction was seen within the first 2 weeks, particularly in patients presenting with TIA and minor stroke (two of 6,691 participants in the aspirin group with TIA or minor stroke had a disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke vs 23 of 5,726 in the control group; 95% CI HR 0.07, 0.02–0.31, p = 0.0004).

Aspirin also reduced the early risks of any recurrent stroke, fatal stroke, and acute myocardial infarction. There was no increase in the 12-week risk of intracerebral haemorrhage on low-dose aspirin versus control (three of 4,125 participants in the active group had an event vs five of 4,137 in the control group), but there was a trend towards a higher risk for high-dose aspirin compared with control (five of 4,297 vs one of 3,159; HR 3.68, 95% CI).

### Age-specific risks, severity, time course, and outcome of bleeding on long-term antiplatelet treatment after vascular events: a population-based cohort study [^1179S6kS]. Lancet (2017). Low credibility.

Lifelong antiplatelet treatment is recommended after ischaemic vascular events, based on trials conducted mainly in patients younger than 75 years. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a serious complication, but it had a low case fatality in aspirin trials and is not generally thought to cause long-term disability. Consequently, although co-prescription of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduces upper gastrointestinal bleeds by 70–90%, uptake is low and guidelines are conflicting. We aimed to assess the risk, time course, and outcomes of bleeding on antiplatelet treatment for secondary prevention in patients of all ages.

We conducted a prospective population-based cohort study in patients with a first transient ischaemic attack, ischaemic stroke, or myocardial infarction treated with antiplatelet drugs (mainly aspirin-based, without routine PPI use) after the event in the Oxford Vascular Study from 2002 to 2012, with follow-up until 2013. We determined type, severity, outcome (disability or death), and time course of bleeding requiring medical attention by face-to-face follow-up for 10 years. We estimated age-specific numbers needed to treat (NNT) to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding with routine PPI co-prescription based on Kaplan–Meier risk estimates and relative risk reduction estimates from previous trials.

A total of 3166 patients (1582 [50%] aged ≥ 75 years) experienced 405 first bleeding events (n = 218 gastrointestinal, n = 45 intracranial, and n = 142 other) during 13,509 patient-years of follow-up. Of the 314 patients (78%) with bleeds admitted, the findings provide significant insights into the complexities of antiplatelet treatment across varied age groups.

### Strategies to prevent blood loss and reduce transfusion in emergency general surgery, WSES-AAST consensus paper [^111ZPRDp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Discontinuation of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents is a critical consideration in emergency general surgery. In general, whenever possible, discontinuation of all antiplatelets (i.e. aspirin, clopidogrel) and anticoagulants (i.e. warfarin, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)) in the perioperative phase is the best option. The decision and timing of interruption are influenced by the patient's characteristics, types of surgery, type of anesthesia (i.e.g.eneral vs. regional), and type of anticoagulant. Some patients direly need these drugs to continue to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular and thrombotic events. In these cases, the decision needs to be multidisciplinary and tailored to the patient's specific condition. The intrinsic risks of suspending these agents must be balanced against the procedure-related risks of bleeding. The discussion about the risk-benefit balance must be conducted together with the patient and appropriate specialists.

In general, due to its pharmacokinetics, aspirin can be continued for most emergency surgical procedures. Its discontinuation may be considered in the postoperative period according to the risk-benefit balance. Regarding warfarin, stopping it and bridging should be considered only in patients with the highest risk of thrombosis (i.e. those with mechanical heart valves or venous thromboembolism within the previous 3 months); postoperative bridging should not be started until at least 48 hours after surgery with a high bleeding risk.

DOACs, owing to their predictable pharmacokinetics, should be stopped 48 hours before most operations in the presence of normal hepatic and renal function.

### Ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes and a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [^1141sytr]. Circulation (2012). High credibility.

Patients with acute coronary syndromes and a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) have an increased rate of recurrent cardiac events and intracranial hemorrhages.

- **Methods and results**: We evaluated treatment effects of ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndrome, with and without a history of prior stroke or TIA, in the PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial. Of the 18,624 randomized patients, 1152 (6.2%) had a history of stroke or TIA. Such patients had higher rates of myocardial infarction (11.5% versus 6.0%), death (10.5% versus 4.9%), stroke (3.4% versus 1.2%), and intracranial bleeding (0.8% versus 0.2%) than patients without prior stroke or TIA. Among patients with a history of stroke or TIA, the reduction of the primary composite outcome and total mortality at 1 year with ticagrelor versus clopidogrel was consistent with the overall trial results: 19.0% versus 20.8% (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.66–1.13; interaction P = 0.84) and 7.9% versus 13.0% (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.42–0.91). The overall PLATO-defined bleeding rates were similar: 14.6% versus 14.9% (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.71–1.37), and intracranial bleeding occurred infrequently (4 versus 4 cases, respectively).

- **Conclusions**: Patients with acute coronary syndrome with a prior history of ischemic stroke or TIA had higher rates of clinical outcomes than patients without prior stroke or TIA. However, the efficacy and bleeding results of ticagrelor in these high-risk patients were consistent with the overall trial outcomes.

### Prasugrel [^114cBf2E]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Warning: Bleeding risk**: Prasugrel can cause significant, sometimes fatal, bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Do not use prasugrel in patients with active pathological bleeding or a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke [see Contraindications (4.1, 4.2)]. In patients aged 75 years or older, prasugrel is generally not recommended due to the increased risk of fatal and intracranial bleeding and uncertain benefit. However, in high-risk situations, such as patients with diabetes or a history of prior myocardial infarction (MI), its effect may be more significant, and its use may be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

- **Surgical considerations**: Do not start prasugrel in patients likely to undergo urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). When possible, discontinue prasugrel at least seven days prior to any surgery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Additional risk factors for bleeding**: These include body weight less than 60 kg, propensity to bleed, and the concomitant use of medications that increase bleeding risks, such as warfarin, heparin, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Monitoring for bleeding**: Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), CABG, or other surgical procedures while on prasugrel [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. If possible, manage bleeding without discontinuing prasugrel. Discontinuing prasugrel, particularly in the first few weeks following acute coronary syndrome, should be approached with caution.

### Balancing benefits and risks of long-term antiplatelet therapy in noncardioembolic transient ischemic attack or stroke [^111CW7Sa]. Stroke (2021). Low credibility.

Lifelong treatment with antiplatelet drugs is recommended following a transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke. Bleeding complications may offset the benefit of antiplatelet drugs in patients at increased risk of bleeding and low risk of re-ischemic events. We aimed to investigate the net benefit of antiplatelet treatment according to an individual's bleeding risk.

- **Methods**: We pooled individual patient data from six randomized clinical trials: CAPRIE (Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events), ESPS-2 (European Stroke Prevention Study-2), MATCH (Management of Atherothrombosis with Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients), CHARISMA (Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management, and Avoidance), ESPRIT (European/Australasian Stroke Prevention in Reversible Ischemia Trial), and PRoFESS (Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes), investigating antiplatelet therapy in the subacute or chronic phase following a noncardioembolic transient ischemic attack or stroke. Patients were stratified into quintiles according to their predicted risk of major bleeding with the S2TOP-BLEED score. The annual risk of major bleeding and re-ischemic events was assessed per quintile for four scenarios: (1) aspirin monotherapy, (2) aspirin-clopidogrel versus aspirin or clopidogrel monotherapy, (3) aspirin-dipyridamole versus clopidogrel, and (4) aspirin versus clopidogrel. Net benefit was calculated for the second, third, and fourth scenario.

- **Results**: Thirty-seven thousand eighty-seven patients were included in the analysis.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: A guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^1164WDRJ]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, specifically antiplatelet therapy, the AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor plus aspirin for 30 days. This approach aims to reduce the risk of a 30-day recurrent stroke in patients with certain conditions, while recognizing the potential increased risk of serious bleeding events, including intracerebral hemorrhage.

- **Recent (< 24 hours) minor-to-moderate stroke**: NIHSS score ≤ 5.
- **High-risk TIA**: ABCD² score ≥ 6.
- **Symptomatic intracranial or extracranial stenosis**: ≥ 30% stenosis of an artery that could account for the event.

### Age-specific risks, severity, time course, and outcome of bleeding on long-term antiplatelet treatment after vascular events: a population-based cohort study [^111V3XDt]. Lancet (2017). Low credibility.

Lifelong antiplatelet treatment is recommended after ischemic vascular events, based on trials mainly involving patients younger than 75 years. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a serious complication, but it had a low case fatality rate in trials of aspirin and is not generally thought to cause long-term disability. Consequently, although co-prescription of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduces upper gastrointestinal bleeds by 70–90%, uptake is low and guidelines are conflicting.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: A guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^111NF3pH]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, specifically with respect to antiplatelet therapy, the AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend initiating early dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel), ideally within 12–24 hours of symptom onset and at least within 7 days of onset. This therapy should be continued for 21–90 days, followed by single antiplatelet therapy, to reduce the risk of a recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with a recent minor (NIHSS score ≤ 3) non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA (ABCD² score ≥ 4).

### Risk of postpolypectomy bleeding with uninterrupted clopidogrel therapy in an industry-independent, double-blind, randomized trial [^113jfeaF]. Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend withholding clopidogrel 7 days before polypectomy to decrease bleeding risk, but these were written based on limited evidence. We investigated whether uninterrupted clopidogrel therapy increases the risk of delayed postpolypectomy bleeding in patients undergoing colonoscopy.

- **Methods**: We identified patients receiving clopidogrel for cardiovascular disease undergoing elective colonoscopies in Hong Kong from February 28, 2012, through April 11, 2018. Eligible patients were instructed to stop taking clopidogrel 7 days before colonoscopy. Then, they were randomly assigned to groups given clopidogrel (75 mg) or placebo daily until the morning of colonoscopy. All patients resumed their usual prescriptions of clopidogrel after colonoscopy. The primary endpoint was delayed postpolypectomy bleeding that required hospitalization or intervention up to 30 days after colonoscopy. Secondary endpoints were immediate postpolypectomy bleeding and serious cardio-thrombotic events for as long as 6 months after colonoscopy, according to Antithrombotic Trialists' criteria. All events were adjudicated by an independent masked committee.

- **Results**: In total, 387 patients underwent colonoscopy and 216 required polypectomies (106 patients in the clopidogrel group and 110 patients in the placebo group). The cumulative incidence of delayed postpolypectomy bleeding was 3.8% (95% confidence interval 1.4–9.7) in the clopidogrel group and 3.6% (95% confidence interval 1.4–9.4) in the placebo group (P = 0.945 by log-rank test). There were no significant differences.

### Time elapsed after ischemic stroke and risk of adverse cardiovascular events and mortality following elective noncardiac surgery [^1124u7qP]. JAMA (2014). Low credibility.

The timing of surgery in patients with recent ischemic stroke is an important and inadequately addressed issue. The objective of this study was to assess the safety and importance of time elapsed between stroke and surgery in the risk of perioperative cardiovascular events and mortality.

This Danish nationwide cohort study, conducted from 2005 to 2011, included all patients aged 20 years or older undergoing elective noncardiac surgeries, totaling 481,183 surgeries. The primary exposure was the time elapsed between stroke and surgery, categorized and measured continuously.

The main outcomes and measures were the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), which included ischemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality, as well as all-cause mortality up to 30 days after surgery. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using multivariable logistic regression models.

The results indicated that crude incidence rates of MACE were 54.4 (95% CI, 49.1–59.9) per 1000 patients with prior stroke (n = 7,137) compared to 4.1 (95% CI, 3.9–4.2) per 1000 patients without prior stroke (n = 474,046). Compared with patients without stroke, the ORs for MACE were 14.23 (95% CI, 11.61–17.45) for strokes within less than 3 months prior to surgery, 4.85 (95% CI, 3.32–7.08) for strokes within 3 to less than 6 months prior, 3.04 (95% CI, 2.13–4.34) for strokes within 6 to less than 12 months prior, and 2.47 (95% CI, 2.07–2.95) for strokes occurring 12 months or more prior.

The risks of MACE were at least as high for low-risk surgeries (OR, 9.96; 95% CI, 5.49–18.07 for stroke < 3 months) and intermediate-risk surgeries (OR, 17.12; 95% CI, 13.68–21.42 for stroke < 3 months) when compared with high-risk surgeries (OR, 2.97).

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for acute minor ischaemic stroke or high risk transient ischaemic attack: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^116hHnUc]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Two reviewers independently screened the title, abstract, and full text levels of potentially eligible studies. A third team member reviewed all final decisions, and disagreements were resolved through discussion. This process also applied to risk of bias ratings and the extraction of key variables such as the number of events. When reports omitted data considered important, authors were contacted for clarification and additional information.

Two reviewers independently extracted several data points using a pre-designed data extraction form. This included characteristics of the enrolled patient population, a description of the intervention and control, and the description and event rate of patient-important outcomes. To determine the timeframe of any apparent benefit, incidence curves presented in the primary studies were reviewed.

To address risk of bias, a modified version of the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials was used. This involved assessing the generation of random sequences, concealment of allocation sequences, blinding of participants, healthcare providers, data collectors, outcome assessors, or adjudicators, handling of incomplete outcome data (judged as low risk if the missing data rate was below 10%), and other potential sources of bias such as early trial discontinuation. The overall risk of bias for each study was rated based on the highest risk of bias for any criterion. Risk of bias was evaluated on an outcome-by-outcome basis, noting any differences across outcomes.
