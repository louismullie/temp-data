## Question

69 old male with low back pain worsening over 6 months. No radicular symptoms. Pain better bending forward. Straight leg test is negative. X-ray from 3 years ago showed mild lumbar degenerative disease. What is next best imaging to get

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the next best imaging test is for a 69-year-old man with 6 months of chronic low back pain, no radicular symptoms, a negative straight leg raise, pain improved by forward flexion, and prior radiographs showing mild degenerative changes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any red flags are present that would mandate urgent imaging. Then, I should verify whether conservative management has been optimized and for how long. Next, I will consider the clinical pattern and whether it suggests spinal stenosis or another specific pathology. After that, I should review guideline-based thresholds for advanced imaging in chronic low back pain. Finally, I will weigh MRI versus CT and decide whether any immediate imaging is warranted now or if we should first optimize conservative care and reassess in a few weeks.

> Let me first confirm the red flags and neurologic status. There are no red flags such as fever, weight loss, cancer history, trauma, IV drug use, immunosuppression, or bowel/bladder dysfunction, and there are no progressive neurologic deficits, so urgent imaging is not indicated on that basis [^112WuFvJ] [^114UwfEa] [^116BxmRG].

> Wait, let me verify the duration and management context. The pain has persisted for 6 months, which places this in the chronic category; however, I need to check whether a structured conservative program has actually been tried and failed, because guidelines generally advise advanced imaging only after about 6 weeks of optimized conservative therapy and again when patients are candidates for procedures or surgery, or when symptoms persist beyond roughly 3 months despite care [^1151j7Un] [^1152weWt] [^113P9cHj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the pain pattern. Pain that improves with forward flexion is classically associated with lumbar spinal stenosis, but I should confirm that this is a clue rather than a definitive diagnosis; in older adults, degenerative changes are common and often asymptomatic, so imaging must be correlated with the clinical picture before attributing causality [^1115th1Y] [^114GBnCC].

> I need to ensure we are aligned with guideline thresholds. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria recommend MRI without contrast as the initial advanced imaging for subacute or chronic low back pain with persistent or progressive symptoms after about 6 weeks of optimal management, particularly when the patient is a candidate for intervention or surgery; in the absence of red flags and prior management, routine imaging is not recommended, and I should double-check that this patient has indeed had adequate conservative therapy before ordering MRI [^1151j7Un] [^113BXcmc].

> Let me consider the imaging modality choice. MRI is preferred for suspected degenerative stenosis because it delineates central canal, lateral recess, and foraminal compromise, as well as soft tissues and neural elements, whereas CT is reserved for MRI contraindications or when bony detail is paramount; given no contraindications here, MRI without contrast is the appropriate first advanced study if imaging is indicated [^116qTvTr] [^1156Qu3W].

> But wait, what if we are overcalling the need for imaging now? I should confirm whether conservative management has truly been optimized, because routine imaging in chronic non-specific low back pain without red flags does not improve outcomes and may lead to harm through unnecessary procedures and patient anxiety; if conservative therapy has not been tried or has been inadequate, the next best step is to optimize nonoperative care and reassess in about 6 weeks before obtaining MRI [^112TNJNZ] [^116r9dFW] [^112dgTs3].

> I will now examine the immediate next step. Given that symptoms have persisted for 6 months but there is no documentation of a structured conservative program and no red flags, the most appropriate next action is to optimize conservative management now and, if symptoms persist or progress after a further 6-week trial, obtain a lumbar spine MRI without contrast as the first advanced imaging study; if MRI is contraindicated, CT myelography or CT could be considered secondarily, but that is not the case here [^1151j7Un] [^1156Qu3W].

> Let me reconsider the timing to avoid premature imaging. Early MRI in low back pain without clear indications has been associated with worse disability outcomes and higher costs, reinforcing the principle that advanced imaging should follow a failed conservative course rather than precede it; therefore, I should document the conservative plan and reassess before ordering MRI unless new red flags or neurologic deficits emerge [^116wXMQt] [^112TNJNZ].

> Final recommendation: Do not obtain immediate advanced imaging now; instead, initiate or escalate conservative therapy with activity, physical therapy, analgesics, and education, and if symptoms persist beyond an additional 6 weeks of optimized care or if the patient becomes a candidate for procedures, then obtain a lumbar spine MRI without contrast as the next best imaging study [^1151j7Un] [^113BXcmc] [^112xTTUU].

---

The next best imaging for a 69-year-old man with 6 months of low back pain, no radicular symptoms, pain improved by forward flexion, and a negative straight leg test is **lumbar spine MRI without contrast** [^1151j7Un]. This is indicated for chronic low back pain persisting beyond 6 weeks without red flags, especially when considering interventional or surgical options [^1151j7Un]. MRI best evaluates **soft tissues**, including discs, facet joints, and spinal canal, and can identify spinal stenosis or degenerative changes that correlate with the clinical picture [^116qTvTr]. Routine CT or repeat X-ray is not recommended in the absence of red flags or neurologic deficits [^113BXcmc] [^112TNJNZ].

---

## Clinical indications for advanced imaging

According to the American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria, **advanced imaging is indicated** for chronic low back pain (persisting beyond 6 weeks) when symptoms are severe, progressive, or refractory to conservative management, and the patient is a candidate for intervention or surgery [^1151j7Un]. The ACR specifically recommends **MRI without contrast** as the initial advanced imaging modality for chronic low back pain without red flags [^1151j7Un].

---

## Rationale for MRI in this clinical scenario

MRI is the **preferred imaging modality** in this scenario for the following reasons:

- **Soft tissue evaluation**: MRI provides superior visualization of soft tissues, including intervertebral discs, facet joints, ligaments, and the spinal canal, which are critical in evaluating degenerative lumbar spine conditions [^116xcjhc].

- **Spinal stenosis assessment**: MRI is highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing lumbar spinal stenosis, a condition characterized by narrowing of the spinal canal or neural foramina, which often presents with pain relieved by forward flexion [^116qTvTr].

- **Degenerative changes**: MRI can accurately identify degenerative disc disease, facet joint hypertrophy, and other age-related changes that may contribute to chronic low back pain [^114T5crf].

- **Absence of radiation**: MRI does not involve ionizing radiation, making it a safer option for repeated imaging in elderly patients [^notfound].

---

## Alternative imaging modalities and their limitations

While MRI is the preferred modality, **alternative imaging options** exist with specific limitations:

| **Imaging modality** | **Indications** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| CT scan | - Suspected fracture <br/> - Severe degenerative changes <br/> - MRI contraindicated | - Limited soft tissue visualization <br/> - Ionizing radiation exposure [^114pK5br] |
| Plain radiography (X-ray) | - Acute trauma <br/> - Suspected fracture <br/> - Severe deformity | - Limited sensitivity for soft tissue pathology <br/> - Not recommended for routine chronic low back pain evaluation [^113BXcmc] |
| CT myelography | - MRI contraindicated <br/> - Suspected complex spinal stenosis | - Invasive <br/> - Ionizing radiation exposure <br/> - Potential complications [^114pK5br] |

---

In this clinical scenario, **CT or plain radiography is not recommended** because there are no red flags (e.g. trauma, infection, malignancy, or progressive neurologic deficits) and no suspicion of fracture or severe deformity [^113BXcmc].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

The ACR Appropriateness Criteria explicitly recommend **MRI without contrast** as the initial advanced imaging modality for chronic low back pain without red flags [^notfound]. The American College of Physicians (ACP) and American Pain Society (APS) similarly recommend MRI or CT only when patients are candidates for surgery or epidural corticosteroid injections, or when serious underlying conditions are suspected [^116uiKNp] [^114v4FW4]. Given the patient's chronic symptoms and the consideration of interventional or surgical management, **MRI is appropriate and indicated** [^1151j7Un].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The next best imaging modality for a 69-year-old male with chronic low back pain, no radicular symptoms, pain improved by forward flexion, and a negative straight leg test is **lumbar spine MRI without contrast** [^1151j7Un]. MRI is the preferred modality because it provides superior visualization of soft tissues, accurately identifies spinal stenosis and degenerative changes, and avoids ionizing radiation. Alternative imaging modalities, such as CT or plain radiography, are not recommended in the absence of red flags or specific clinical indications [^113BXcmc].

Imaging studies in low back pain — overall role and indications emphasize limited diagnostic value for routine use: Imaging modalities have frequent false positive and negative results, the primary utility of imaging lies in interventional and/or surgical planning or in determining the presence of serious medical conditions, and lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the most useful tool. Routine ordering of imaging for low back pain should be discouraged, and current recommendations from the American College of Physicians are that (1) imaging is only indicated for severe progressive neurological deficits or when red flags are suspected, and (2) routine imaging does not result in clinical benefit and may lead to harm.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® low back pain: 2021 update [^1152weWt]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the United States, acute low back pain, with or without radiculopathy, is the leading cause of years lived with disability and the third ranking cause of disability-adjusted life-years. Uncomplicated acute low back pain and/or radiculopathy is a benign, self-limited condition that does not warrant any imaging studies. Imaging is considered in those patients who have had up to 6 weeks of medical management and physical therapy that resulted in little or no improvement in their back pain. It is also considered for those patients presenting with red flags, raising suspicion for a serious underlying condition, such as cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, fracture, or infection. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Clinical aspects of degenerative spine disease and reporting

The role of imaging is to provide accurate morphological information and influence therapeutic decision-making. The presence of degenerative change is not itself an indicator of symptoms. In the majority of cases, when patients with degenerative spine diseases are referred for imaging, clinicians are looking for answers to two simple questions: what is the cause of the patient's pain or neurological symptoms, and what treatment option should be primarily considered in this particular situation? Therefore, these imaging findings must be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical condition. In the majority of cases, even in advanced cases of degenerative spine disease with multilevel involvement, it is possible to identify one leading cause of the patient's problem or to provide a list of potential choices or culprits so that the referring physician can select the right answer based on the presentation, clinical symptoms and physical examination of the patient.

How should practice change?

Practice changes in the following key areas are required to support appropriate imaging use:

Diagnostic triage and management — Evidence suggests that, by conducting a more thorough diagnostic triage, clinicians can discern which patients fall into the category of non-specific LBP. Papers by Bardin et aland Traegar et alpresent a useful visual aid (fig 1) for conducting diagnostic triage in patients with LBP. Bardin et al's visual aid also details evidence based treatments for patients assessed to have radicular syndrome or non-specific LBP. We have supplemented this with a decision support tool (fig 2) to help clinicians identify the small subgroup of patients with suspected red flag conditions who do need imaging. As detailed in figure 1, advise all patients with non-specific LBP or radicular syndromes, regardless of pain duration, to remain active and reassure them of a good prognosis.

### ACR appropriateness criteria low back Pain [^1172qyrP]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Most patients presenting with uncomplicated acute low back pain (LBP) and/or radiculopathy do not require imaging. Imaging is considered in those patients who have had up to 6 weeks of medical management and physical therapy that resulted in little or no improvement in their back pain. It is also considered for those patients presenting with red flags raising suspicion for serious underlying conditions, such as cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, fracture, and infection. Many imaging modalities are available to clinicians and radiologists for evaluating LBP. Application of these modalities depends largely on the working diagnosis, the urgency of the clinical problem, and comorbidities of the patient. When there is concern for fracture of the lumbar spine, multidetector CT is recommended. Those deemed to be interventional candidates, with LBP lasting for > 6 weeks having completed conservative management with persistent radiculopathic symptoms, may seek MRI. Patients with severe or progressive neurologic deficit on presentation and red flags should be evaluated with MRI. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Lumbar spine MRI for low back pain: indications and yield [^116i7t8Z]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Low back pain is one of the most common causes of physician visits in the United States with an enormous socioeconomic burden. Because of this burden, numerous studies have focused on its diagnosis and management. New technologies have been quickly adopted with the hope that they will improve our understanding of the physiopathology of the disease and assist us in alleviating patients' pain and discomfort. Unfortunately, previous studies have not been able to show that higher utilization of advanced imaging technology is associated with improvements in patient outcome. This article highlights practices that are evidence-based versus those that are common, or heterogeneous, but not supported by existing evidence. We also highlight outstanding areas for further research.

Conclusion

Clinicians and researchers should be encouraged to follow standardized practices in accordance with evidence-based medicine guidelines. The use of such guidelines will decrease variation in care, allowing researchers to more easily design and conduct comparative effectiveness studies of diagnostic imaging.

### Appropriate use of diagnostic imaging in low back pain: a reminder that unnecessary imaging may do as much harm as good [^112kSXKv]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The rate of lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging in the United States is growing at an alarming rate, despite evidence that it is not accompanied by improved patient outcomes. Overutilization of lumbar imaging in individuals with low back pain correlates with, and likely contributes to, a 2- to 3-fold increase in surgical rates over the last 10 years. Furthermore, a patient's knowledge of imaging abnormalities can actually decrease self-perception of health and may lead to fear-avoidance and catastrophizing behaviors that may predispose people to chronicity. The purpose of this clinical commentary is as follows: (1) to describe an outline of the appropriate use, as defined in recent guidelines, of diagnostic imaging in patients with low back pain; (2) to describe how inappropriate use of lumbar spine imaging can increase the risk of patient harm and contributes to the recent large increases in healthcare costs; (3) to provide physical therapists with clear guidelines to educate patients on both appropriate imaging and information to dampen the potential negative effects of imaging on patients' perceptions and health; and (4) to present an example of a successful clinical pathway that has reduced imaging and improved outcomes.

### Applying a knowledge translation framework for triaging low back pain and radicular pain at an emergency department: an iterative process within an uncontrolled before-and-after design [^116ocXSw]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Background

Low back pain (LBP) is the number one cause of years lived with disability worldwide, with a point prevalence of 9.6% and an incidence rate of 3951 new cases/100 000 individuals per year. In Belgium, the situation seems even worse with a point-prevalence of 18.2%. In approximately 10% of the cases, the pain and functional impairment will continue beyond 3 months after onset, which results in high healthcare costs and work absence. Therefore, appropriate management of acute LBP and investment in the avoidance of chronicity is crucial.

In the large majority of patients with acute onset LBP and radicular pain, pain and function are likely to recover spontaneously within weeks. Most often, acute LBP is not attributable to a specific cause, but rather represents an acute mechanical overload leading to symptoms because of reduced load bearing capacity. Reassurance and activation are most accurate in those situations and referral to specialist medical care is not required on the condition that a competent healthcare professional has ruled out potentially worrisome pathologies that might potentially endanger the patient when missed (also called 'red flags'). In the absence of red flags, imaging does not affect management. On the contrary, it has been shown that referral of these patients for diagnostic imaging or for a medical specialist consult may rather facilitate chronicity, disability and overmedicalisation. Imaging, however, is still being overused in LBP. Evidence indicates that diagnostic imaging for LBP without any indication of a serious underlying cause does not improve patient outcomes and can in fact be harmful to patients due to radiation exposure on the one hand and imposing a sickness label on patients on the other hand.

There have been some conflicting reports on the relative merits and limitations of the procedure in the diagnosis and treatment planning of low back pain and radiculopathy; further studies are needed to determine with certainty whether discography is in fact able to localize the precise discs of clinical significance and accurately predict those patients who will respond well to surgery and those who will not.

Background

LBP is a common condition in the United States — approximately 80% of adults have LBP at some point during their life and roughly 30% of the adult population suffer from LBP at any given time. Although LBP is the most common cause of disability in the United States, it often has no identifiable anatomic or physiologic cause. Many patients seeking care for LBP receive lumbar spine radiography, CT or MRI. However, for most patients with acute non-specific LBP, symptoms resolve within 4 weeks and the use of routine imaging may result in unnecessary radiation exposure and add unnecessary costs and wasted time for patients without improved patient outcomes.

National quality guidelines, such as The National Committee of Quality Assurance's Health Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS), established the quality measure for use of image studies for LBP in efforts to improve rates of appropriate imaging in the healthcare setting. Despite these evidence-based guidelines, significant variability in clinical practice exists, with imaging studies often used to diagnose aetiology of acute non-specific LBP.

### Low back pain investigations and prognosis: a review [^116pcDrz]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Low back pain is reviewed in terms of when investigations are useful and its clinical course. Despite the extensive evaluation of the accuracy of investigations such as radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and myelography, there is a surprising dearth of research to inform their use in primary care. There is no clear evidence on which to base judgments for selection of appropriate tests to confirm or exclude low back pain pathology. It appears that investigations are rarely necessary for low back pain. Specific investigations should be ordered to identify a particular pathology but should not be ordered routinely for general screening. In the absence of pathology, low back pain and its associated disability improve rapidly in the first weeks after onset, but, in contradiction to all guidelines, both commonly persist and the best evidence suggests that recurrences are common.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^116ZsSFX]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Management of lumbar radicular pain depends on whether neurologic deficit is present. The definition of lumbar radiculopathy is radicular pain in the setting of focal weakness and/or asymmetrically diminished deep tendon reflexes. Objective sensory impairment may be evident on examination, but it is not a criterion for defining radiculopathy. Electrodiagnostic studies, although not necessary to make the diagnosis, are abnormal in lumbar radiculopathy. Deep tendon reflexes are commonly diminished bilaterally in older adults; therefore, in our algorithm we only recommend pursuing management of radiculopathy if the patient has objective evidence of asymmetric weakness on exam.

Patients with radiculopathy are at risk for progressive and permanent neurologic damage. Therefore, if a clinician is concerned for lumbar radiculopathy based on history and physical exam, the patient would benefit from urgent imaging and referral. Advanced imaging such as lumbar spine MRI (or CT if MRI is contraindicated) is useful to plan interventions such as epidural corticosteroid injections and/or surgical decompression. When referring the patient for specialist care, we recommend initial evaluation by a non-operative musculoskeletal provider if available, because not all radiculopathy requires surgical management. Seventy percent of patients with lumbar radiculopathy will improve with conservative care within 4 weeks of the onset of symptoms, and up to 90% of patients with lumbar radiculopathy from a herniated disc (in the absence of significant lumbar spinal stenosis) treated with core stabilization exercises and education eventually achieve good or excellent outcomes. Especially in the aging population, avoiding unnecessary surgical procedures can help minimize associated morbidity and peri-operative complications. Nevertheless, this population will require close follow-up for patients who do not improve and in those with functionally significant weakness that may benefit from surgical decompression within the first 8 weeks of symptom onset.

Degenerative changes of the spine may involve the disc space, the facet joints, or the supportive and surrounding soft tissues. MR imaging is ideally suited for delineating the presence, extent, and complications of degenerative spinal disease. Other imaging modalities such as radiography, myelography, and CT may provide complimentary information in selected cases. Percutaneous procedures may be used to confirm that a morphologic abnormality is the source of symptoms. Correlation with clinical and electrophysiologic data is also helpful for accurate diagnosis. Combining the information obtained from imaging studies with the patient's clinical presentation is mandatory for determining the appropriate patient management strategy, especially true in patients afflicted with any condition directly attributed to the degenerative processes of the spine.

### Lumbar spinal stenosis in older adults [^1115th1Y]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a frequent cause of low back pain among adults, caused by a narrowing impinging on the spinal cord or nerve roots. Several conditions cause LSS, including disc herniation, spondylolisthesis, tumor, fractures, and other degenerative changes. Back pain is frequently experienced. MRI is the radiologic modality of choice. Radiographic evidence of LSS may not correlate well with symptoms. An increase in utilization of surgery has been noted. However, surgery has no significant benefit over more conservative options. An appropriate risk/benefit discussion between the patient and an interdisciplinary medical team is optimal.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^114SSdSk]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after new serious low back pain (LBP) episodes — Carragee et al investigated 200 subjects in a 5-year prospective observational study and specified that if a new serious LBP episode had a rating scale intensity ≥ 6 for ≥ 1 week, MR imaging taken within 6–12 weeks of the episode was compared with baseline images. A total of 51 subjects had repeat scans available; subjects having another MR were more likely to have had baseline psychological distress (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.15–4.49), and only 2 subjects with primary radicular complaints had new findings of probable clinical significance. The authors concluded that it was highly unlikely that new findings on MRI within 12 weeks of serious LBP represent any new structural change, and this study provides Level III evidence that, in the setting of new back pain, MRI is highly unlikely to detect new structural disease and instead represents existing structural disease.

### Neuroimaging in low back pain [^117JLozJ]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Patients commonly present to family physicians with low back pain. Because the majority of patients fully or partially recover within six weeks, imaging studies are generally not recommended in the first month of acute low back pain. Exceptions include patients with suspected cauda equina syndrome, infection, tumor, fracture, or progressive neurologic deficit. Patients who do not improve within one month should obtain magnetic resonance imaging if a herniated disc is suspected. Computed tomographic scanning is useful in demonstrating osseous structures and their relations to the neural canal, and for assessment of fractures. Bone scans can be used to determine the extent of metastatic disease throughout the skeletal system. All imaging results should be correlated with the patient's signs and symptoms because of the high rate of positive imaging findings in asymptomatic persons.

Evidence notes that "most patients with lumbar disc herniation and radiculopathy will improve with noninvasive management within four weeks", and that imaging "did not significantly improve outcomes in patients for whom there was no pretest concern for serious underlying conditions"; red flags analyzed "included suspicion or history of cancer, IV drug use, indwelling vascular catheter, and other infection sites". The Work Group observed that "the laboratory and imaging tests in question posed relatively little harm; however, there is enormous harm caused by failure to diagnose a serious pathology", and despite "very low quality evidence", "the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low", yet it "concluded this recommendation continued to merit a Strong for rating considering the high likelihood of catastrophic harms from a failure to identify a serious underlying condition that is causing LBP".

### ACR appropriateness criteria® thoracic back pain [^111DRPya]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Thoracic back pain is a common site for inflammatory, neoplastic, metabolic, infectious, and degenerative conditions, and may be associated with significant disability and morbidity. Uncomplicated acute thoracic back pain and/or radiculopathy does not typically warrant imaging. Imaging may be considered in those patients who have persistent pain despite 6 weeks of conservative treatment. Early imaging may also be warranted in patients presenting with "red flag" history or symptoms, including those with a known or suspected history of cancer, infection, immunosuppression, or trauma; in myelopathic patients; or in those with a history of prior thoracic spine fusion. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Surgical management of cervical and lumbosacral radiculopathies: indications and outcomes [^117MRDea]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The most common indication for the surgical management of compressive cervical and lumbar radiculopathies is a herniated disc in a patient who has not improved with conservative management. Even though a herniated disk is a common condition, it is paramount that the examining physician considers an extensive differential diagnosis when evaluating radiculopathies, especially in patients with a history of cancer, multiple medical illnesses, secondary gain, or advanced age. This consideration has become even more important as imaging studies have improved, because previously undetected degenerative changes are now clearly visualized on MRI and CT scans. These improved studies, however, do not replace a thorough history and physical examination, because a patient's signs and symptoms may not correlate with the radiographic findings. The authors have presented a series of surgical techniques used to manage cervical and lumbar discectomies to the most recent "minimally invasive" percutaneous techniques. Much debate and controversy surround these more recent techniques. There is no controversy, however, in stating that achieving good outcomes, regardless of technique, is predicated on proper patient selection. Because patient selection is the most important predictor of outcome and because serious complications have been reported with "minimally invasive" percutaneous procedures, the authors continue to advocate the proven traditional surgical approaches until prospective, randomized studies demonstrate a clear benefit to using alternative techniques.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^114ZLMiJ]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation and radiculopathy — about 95% of herniated discs occur at the lower lumbar spine (L4/5 and L5/S1 level); disc herniation above this level is more common in people aged over 55 years. The estimated prevalence of lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica has been described as 9.8 per 1,000 cases, 5.1 in men and 3.7 in women. Lumbar radiculopathy secondary to disc herniation resolves spontaneously in 23% to 48% of patients, but up to 30% to 70% will still have significant symptoms after one year, with 5% to 15% of patients undergoing surgery. Based on controlled evaluations, lumbar intervertebral discography has been shown to diagnose internal disc disruption in 39% of a younger cohort of patients with low back pain, and in a study without assessing internal disc disruption the reported prevalence rate of discogenic pain was 26%.

### Improving appropriate imaging for non-specific low back pain [^115KfSf5]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

In response, we sought to build awareness and enhance engagement and buy-in by conducting educational sessions with key ordering provider groups in internal medicine (eg, attending physicians, hospitalists and residents) to review clinical practice variabilities and share information from the Choosing Wisely campaign about avoiding imaging studies for acute non-specific LBP without specific indications.

During this first phase, all LBP imaging orders were examined to see if they met appropriate HEDIS criteria and to isolate where and why HEDIS quality measures may be lower than desired for acute non-specific LBP imaging orders. During clinic rounding, HEDIS criteria were communicated with providers to improve adherence and documentation.

For our next phase of the study, we implemented changes to the EMR. Prior to implementation, guidance was not provided for image ordering for non-specific LBP. Working with information technology, we developed CDS order sets and built practice alerts and reminders in the EMR to marry the clinical guidelines with our institution's order entry system that established a standardised workflow for non-specific LBP. A new order panel (see figure 1) was developed that required patients to meet specific criteria to minimise inappropriate imaging and improve guideline-adherent practice. After the history and physical examination of the patient, providers were required to answer a series of questions during the order entry process. Provider responses placed patients presenting with LBP into categories (eg, non-specific LBP; LBP associated with radiculopathy or spinal stenosis; LBP associated with other specific spinal causes) that included discrete indications for X-ray, MRI and CT scans based on evidence-based recommendations for appropriate imaging. As such, diagnostic imaging studies were to be performed only in those patients who have severe or progressive neurologic deficits or were suspected of having a serious or specific underlying condition (eg, cancer, trauma). Access to imaging was denied when providers did not document compliance with institutionally approved indications though providers were allowed to proceed with an override by entering an active acknowledgement for opposing recommendations.

Diagnosis & Treatment of Low Back Pain — diagnostic questions: There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against obtaining laboratory tests to assess for inflammatory disease in patients with sacroiliac joint pain (Grade of Recommendation: I). For pain diagram findings, a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address these questions, and for assessment tools or questionnaires to identify the cause of acute, subacute or chronic low back pain, a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question. For whether certain history and physical examination findings would warrant obtaining advanced imaging studies, a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question; however, the Work Group Consensus Statement notes that in the absence of reliable evidence, it is the work group's opinion that, in patients with severe and intractable pain syndromes who have failed medical/interventional treatment, advanced imaging may be indicated, and that subgroups have shown higher or lower incidences of radiographic abnormalities based on acuity, tenderness to palpation and provocation maneuvers, but the utility of these findings in guiding treatment is not clear.

Thoracic disc related pathology — diagnostic assessment is based on history, physical examination, neurological examination, and imaging. Age-related imaging changes in asymptomatic subjects are common, and plain radiographs are not sensitive enough to exclude disease. Computed tomography (CT) myelography is an alternative when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is contraindicated; MRI may be too sensitive and yield false-positive findings, though it can reliably distinguish infection, fracture, and tumor. Electrophysiologic studies can objectify nerve conduction abnormalities resulting from radiculopathy, and some patients may require diagnostic interventions with provocation discography and controlled diagnostic facet joint nerve blocks.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — diagnosis and imaging emphasizes core test accuracy concepts and appropriate use of imaging relative to clinical assessment. With tests that have a high sensitivity, a negative test effectively rules out the disease, and with tests that have a high specificity, a positive test effectively rules in the disease; additionally, the performance of a test depends on positive and negative predictive value, which depends directly on the prevalence of disease in the tested population. One of the purposes of a history and physical examination is to increase the prevalence of disease in patients seen for advanced diagnostic imaging/testing or offered surgery, and the review attempted to identify those symptoms or findings which have a high likelihood ratio for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy. Cross-sectional imaging exams have a low intrinsic specificity with significant pathologic findings in asymptomatic populations, so results of any cross-sectional examination need to be closely correlated with the clinical examination. Direct visualization of intrinsic neurologic processes and neural impingement is noted as important in determining the etiology of radicular symptoms. Although the gold standard in the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation is surgery, when assessing the validity of subjective complaints or physical examination findings, use of cross-sectional imaging as a gold standard may be considered an acceptable substitute, though the validity of surgery as a gold standard can be questioned as findings at surgery can be subjective. Additional sufficiently-powered observational studies of history/physical examination findings and diagnostic tests are needed to determine their value in influencing treatment assignment and outcome in patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.

### Diagnostic imaging for low back pain: advice for high-value health care from the American College of Physicians [^114hvKiN]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Diagnostic imaging is indicated for patients with low back pain only if they have severe progressive neurologic deficits or signs or symptoms that suggest a serious or specific underlying condition. In other patients, evidence indicates that routine imaging is not associated with clinically meaningful benefits but can lead to harms. Addressing inefficiencies in diagnostic testing could minimize potential harms to patients and have a large effect on use of resources by reducing both direct and downstream costs. In this area, more testing does not equate to better care. Implementing a selective approach to low back imaging, as suggested by the American College of Physicians and American Pain Society guideline on low back pain, would provide better care to patients, improve outcomes, and reduce costs.

Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis with associated spinal stenosis — imaging test selection is addressed by consensus statements: when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is either contraindicated or inconclusive, CT myelography is suggested as the most appropriate test to confirm the presence of anatomic narrowing of the spinal canal or the presence of nerve root impingement; when MRI and CT myelography are contraindicated, inconclusive or inappropriate, CT is suggested as the most appropriate test to confirm the presence of anatomic narrowing of the spinal canal or the presence of nerve root impingement.

### Iatrogenic consequences of early magnetic resonance imaging in acute, work-related, disabling low back pain [^116wXMQt]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study examined the impact of early MRI for those with acute, disabling, work-related nonspecific, and radicular LBP on disability and medical cost outcomes. The vast majority of the radiculopathy group received MRI within the first month of care, despite guideline recommendations to delay imaging to allow for the natural history of improvement to occur. The receipt of early MRI in both groups was associated with worse outcomes, even after controlling for severity and demographic factors. On average, the rate of going off disability for those who received an early MRI was approximately one-third the rate of those who did not receive MRI. Furthermore, early MRI increased total medical costs (a surrogate for medical use) by approximately $13,000 per case. Even in the subset with relatively prompt resolution of their problem as indicated by short disability duration, there was a striking impact of early MRI on early medical use. These results strengthen the findings of an earlier study with a larger sample that suggested an iatrogenic effect of early MRI. However, the prior study was based on administrative claims data which have limited information regarding history of recurrent or chronic LBP and prior lumbar surgery for which an early MRI might be indicated.

The results related to disability are also similar to a recent study of patients with work-related LBP from Washington state which found that those with both mild/major sprains (comparable to our nonspecific LBP group) and radiculopathy who had early MRI had longer work disability outcomes at 1-year follow-up. A systematic review of randomized trials found no benefit in health, function, or disability outcomes with early MRI in LBP.

The study results underscore the significant consequences associated with the use of nonindicated early MRI. Guidelines recommend against using this modality initially in the management of acute LBP, even with the presence of radiculopathy because it is not likely to improve care. The primary recommendation in acute LBP when red flags are not present (no cases with red flags were present in our cohort) is to pursue a conservative approach because the majority of cases with both nonspecific and radicular LBP will resolve spontaneously within the first 4 to 6 weeks after onset.

### Imaging strategies for low-back pain: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112TNJNZ]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Some clinicians do lumbar imaging routinely or in the absence of historical or clinical features suggestive of serious low-back problems. We investigated the effects of routine, immediate lumbar imaging versus usual clinical care without immediate imaging on clinical outcomes in patients with low-back pain and no indication of serious underlying conditions.

Methods

We analysed randomised controlled trials that compared immediate lumbar imaging (radiography, MRI, or CT) versus usual clinical care without immediate imaging for low-back pain. These trials reported pain or function (primary outcomes), quality of life, mental health, overall patient-reported improvement (based on various scales), and patient satisfaction in care received. Six trials (n = 1804) met inclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed by two independent reviewers with criteria adapted from the Cochrane Back Review Group. Meta-analyses were done with a random effects model.

Findings

We did not record significant differences between immediate lumbar imaging and usual care without immediate imaging for primary outcomes at either short-term (up to 3 months, standardised mean difference 0.19, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.39 for pain and 0.11, -0.29 to 0.50 for function, negative values favour routine imaging) or long-term (6–12 months, -0.04, -0.15 to 0.07 for pain and 0.01, -0.17 to 0.19 for function) follow-up. Other outcomes did not differ significantly. Trial quality, use of different imaging methods, and duration of low-back pain did not affect the results, but analyses were limited by small numbers of trials. Results are most applicable to acute or subacute low-back pain assessed in primary-care settings.

Interpretation

Lumbar imaging for low-back pain without indications of serious underlying conditions does not improve clinical outcomes. Therefore, clinicians should refrain from routine, immediate lumbar imaging in patients with acute or subacute low-back pain and without features suggesting a serious underlying condition.

Plain radiography for low back pain (LBP) — routine x-ray is not recommended for acute non specific LBP (Moderately Not Recommended (B), High Confidence), but is recommended in the setting of red flags where the acute LBP could be due to fracture, neoplasia, infection, or systemic illness and where subacute or chronic LBP is not improved as a means of ruling out other conditions (Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I), High Confidence). Flexion and extension views are not recommended for evaluating symptomatic spondylolisthesis when surgery or other invasive treatment is considered or occasionally in trauma (Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I), Moderate Confidence).

Regarding specific circumstances for low back pain, more specifically with respect to patients with upper back pain, ACR 2024 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining several imaging modalities in adult patients with instrumented spinal fixation history to assess hardware position and integrity, spinal alignment, and fusion, as well as for findings suspicious for infection and postoperative complications. Obtain MRI of the thoracic spine with or without contrast, CT of the thoracic spine, or thoracic spine X-ray as follow-up imaging in this scenario.
Consider obtaining CT myelography of the thoracic spine in selected cases.

### A proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of lumbar discogenic pain [^1156pPgP]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The usefulness and clinical adoption of this algorithm is predicated on a grasp of several key takeaway points and the flexibility to incorporate rapidly emerging new technologies into the continuum of care. Many patients with chronic lumbar discogenic pain are in their 30–50s underscoring the reality that their spine care will span many forthcoming decades. In summary, the starting point for the physical examination assessment is in the identification of patients with midline low back pain with no neurologic deficits that is increased with forward flexion and sitting who have a positive sustained hip flexion test that narrows the diagnostic aperture to anterior column involvement as the primary pain source. The identification of painful intervertebral discs is done via MRI and MRS which represents a potentially novel breakthrough in the precise and personalized diagnosis of lumbar discogenic pain. When these advancements in quantitative imaging are combined with effective first line intradiscal interventions, the potential exists to optimize spine care by restoring and preserving native disc structure and mechanics. There has been a renewed appreciation of the importance of the intervertebral disc as a catalyst in spine degeneration and this has hastened the development of new diagnostic and treatment technologies aimed at averting spinal surgery. A concerted and collaborative effort will be necessary from all stakeholders to amass the supporting compendium of data to fulfill regulatory and reimbursement requirements so that effective treatments can be made available to patients.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for lumbar spinal stenosis, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, ACP/APS 2007 guidelines recommend to elicit a focused medical history and perform a physical examination to categorize patients with low back pain into one of the following broad categories:

- nonspecific low back pain

- back pain potentially associated with radiculopathy or spinal stenosis

- back pain potentially associated with another specific spinal cause.

### Imaging for low back pain | AAFP… [^113Ltt5x]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Don't do imaging for low back pain within the first six weeks, unless red flags are present. Low back pain is the fifth most common reason for all physician visits. Imaging of the lower spine before six weeks does not improve outcomes, but does increase costs. Sources: Agency for Health Care Research and Policy, Cochrane Reviews Low back pain is one of the most common reasons for an outpatient visit. The evaluation for low back pain should include a complete, focused medical history looking for red flags, which include, but are not limited to: severe or progressive neurologic deficits, fever, sudden back pain with spinal tenderness, trauma, and indications of a serious underlying condition.

It is also important to rule out nonspinal causes of back pain, such as pyelonephritis, pancreatitis, penetrating ulcer disease or other gastrointestinal causes, and pelvic disease. Fractures are an uncommon cause of back pain; they are associated with risk factors such as osteoporosis and steroid use. Most patients with radicular symptoms will recover within several weeks of onset. The majority of disc herniations will regress or reabsorb within eight weeks of onset. In the absence of progressive neurologic deficits or other red flags, there is strong evidence to avoid CT/MRI imaging in patients with non-specific low back pain. This recommendation is provided solely for informational purposes and is not intended as a substitute for consultation with a medical professional. Patients with any specific questions about this recommendation or their individual situation should consult their physician.

### Neuroimaging in low back pain | AAFP… [^114pK5br]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

|Recent onset of bladder dysfunction Severe or progressive neurologic deficit in lower extremity| Patients who have experienced recent trauma should be considered for radiographic evaluation. Imaging studies are used to evaluate the extent of osseous, ligamentous, neural, and soft tissue injuries. The initial imaging study should be cost-effective and expeditious, and maintain a minimal diagnostic error rate. For these reasons, a radiographic series may be the most appropriate screening examination. In cases where the initial radiographic series detects misalignment of the spine, the imaging course is determined by the degree of subluxation. If it can be safely obtained, a flexion-extension film allows for assessment of ligamentous injury. The majority of patients with low back pain do not belong to any of these three groups.

Degenerative changes are often evident on plain radiographs; however, caution must be used in making a diagnosis based on degenerative radiographic changes because of the high rate of asymptomatic degenerative changes. Radiographic evidence of degenerative change is most common in patients older than 40 years and is present in more than 70 percent of patients older than 70 years. 14, 15 Possible side effects of myelography include dural tear, which can cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, pain or tightness in the back or neck, dizziness, diplopia, photophobia, tinnitus, or blurred vision. Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI has emerged as the procedure of choice for diagnostic imaging of neurologic structures related to low back pain.

Although a significant variation can exist in the quality of lumbar spine MRI images as a function of the imaging center and the image interpreter, 20 MRI is better than CT in showing the relationship of the disc to the nerve, and at locating soft tissue and nonbony structures. For this reason, it is better than CT at detecting early osteomyelitis, discitis, and epidural-type infections or hematomas. 25, 26 have evaluated the ability of bone scans, with the addition of single-photon emission computed tomography, to distinguish benign lesions from malignant lesions. SPECT scan differs from bone scan because it provides a three-dimensional image that enables physicians to locate the lesion more precisely. Lesions that affect the pedicles are a strong indicator of malignancy, while lesions of the facets are likely to be benign. Lesions of the vertebral body or spinous process are just as likely to be benign as malignant and, therefore, offer little diagnostic evidence. 25.
