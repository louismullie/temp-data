## Question

what does absolute neutrophil count increase mean?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what an increase in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) means. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining ANC and how it is calculated. Then, I should verify what constitutes a normal ANC range and how to interpret an "increase". Next, I will categorize the major etiologies of neutrophilia, including physiologic, inflammatory/infectious, drug-induced, hematologic, and stress-related causes. After that, I should consider special contexts like cancer prognosis, cardiovascular risk, and population-specific baselines such as Duffy-null phenotypes. Finally, I will outline a practical clinical approach to evaluation and when to escalate workup or treatment, making sure I anchor each step to guidelines and high-quality evidence where possible.

> Let me first confirm the definition and calculation so I don't gloss over basics. ANC is the total number of neutrophils per microliter of blood, calculated from the total white blood cell count multiplied by the percentage of neutrophils (segs plus bands) on the differential, and it reflects the body's primary innate defense against bacterial and fungal infections, which is why clinicians track it closely in infection risk contexts [^0d65ef22] [^821b7fa0].

> Wait, let me verify the normal range before labeling something "increased". In adults, a typical ANC is about 1.5–8.0 × 10⁹/L, so an increase generally means values above roughly 8.0 × 10⁹/L, though I should acknowledge that population-specific baselines exist and will revisit that shortly. In children, normal ranges vary by age, so pediatric interpretation must be age-adjusted to avoid misclassification of neutrophilia or neutropenia [^notfound].

> I will now examine the major etiologic buckets for an elevated ANC, starting with physiologic or secondary causes. Exercise, acute stress, pain, and corticosteroids can acutely shift neutrophils from the marginated pool into circulation, producing a transient neutrophilia; I should confirm that this pattern resolves on repeat testing once the stimulus abates, which supports a physiologic rather than pathologic process [^aae46601].

> Next, I should review inflammatory and infectious drivers, because these are common. Bacterial infections, tissue injury, surgery, and inflammatory conditions like gout or rheumatoid arthritis increase neutrophil production and release, often with a left shift. Hold on, I should verify that very high neutrophil percentages strengthen the likelihood of bacterial infection, and indeed interval likelihood ratios show that neutrophil percentage above 80% markedly increases the probability of bacteremia, whereas a binary 70% threshold underestimates risk at higher values, underscoring the need to interpret magnitude rather than a single cutoff [^21563dc0] [^aae46601].

> Let me consider drug-induced neutrophilia carefully. Corticosteroids are classic, but I should also remember lithium and beta-agonists can raise ANC. Initially, I thought clozapine increased ANC, but wait, I should double-check that because clozapine is actually associated with neutropenia and agranulocytosis, not neutrophilia; I need to correct that misconception and ensure I don't misattribute a low ANC on clozapine as an increase [^aae46601] [^b9772091] [^95d0702d].

> I need to check hematologic and malignant causes next. Chronic myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and other myeloproliferative neoplasms can drive autonomous neutrophil production. Importantly, in ET and PV, higher ANC is a component of the AAA prognostic model and correlates with worse survival, and in solid tumors, tumor-related leukocytosis or elevated pretreatment neutrophil counts portend poorer outcomes, reinforcing that persistent neutrophilia can be a marker of disease biology rather than just a reactive state [^9f616c47] [^cfa0243f] [^0f8a45e7].

> But wait, what if the "increase" is relative to a population-specific baseline. Individuals of African ancestry frequently have lower ANC due to the Duffy-null phenotype, so a modest ANC that might seem "normal" in other populations could represent a relative increase for them. I should confirm that recognizing Duffy-null status prevents unnecessary workups and that newer guidance supports population-specific reference ranges to avoid iatrogenic harm from misclassification [^3e54c2b7] [^65ce977d] [^cf4209a7].

> Next, I should review prognostic contexts where an increased ANC carries meaning beyond infection risk. In COPD, higher blood neutrophil counts associate with more frequent exacerbations and higher mortality, and in cardiovascular disease, elevated neutrophil counts independently predict events in postmenopausal hypertensive women and correlate with carotid intima-media thickness and plaque burden, suggesting neutrophils as a marker of systemic inflammation with clinical implications for risk stratification [^df46f489] [^424717b0] [^8081f36b] [^374b4c7b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about any single elevated ANC value. I should confirm a practical, stepwise approach: repeat the CBC with differential to ensure persistence, review the smear for a left shift or abnormal morphology, assess for infection, inflammation, medications, and stress, and tailor further testing to the clinical context. If neutrophilia is extreme, unexplained, or accompanied by cytopenias or blasts, I need to escalate to bone marrow evaluation and molecular testing to exclude myeloid neoplasia, aligning with hematology consultation pathways for quantitative neutrophil abnormalities [^aae46601] [^0f86821a].

> I should double-check that I've integrated key thresholds that change management. In febrile neutropenia, an ANC less than 500/μL defines severe neutropenia and mandates empiric antibiotics, whereas recovery is often tracked until ANC exceeds 500/μL, illustrating how ANC directionality guides both risk and treatment decisions in oncology and infectious disease settings [^2d5c607a] [^c977722f].

> In summary, an increase in ANC means a higher-than-baseline neutrophil concentration in blood, most often reflecting a physiologic stress response, infection or inflammation, medication effect, or underlying hematologic disease. Persistent or marked neutrophilia warrants a structured evaluation to distinguish reactive from clonal causes, with attention to population-specific baselines and prognostic implications in cardio-respiratory and oncologic contexts, so I need to ensure I interpret the value in clinical context and over time rather than in isolation [^aae46601] [^3e54c2b7] [^df46f489] [^9f616c47].

An increase in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) means the body is producing more neutrophils, typically in response to **infection, inflammation, or stress** [^aae46601]. Common causes include bacterial infections, tissue injury, surgery, corticosteroids, and chronic inflammatory diseases [^aae46601]. Persistent or very high ANC (> 10,000/µL) may indicate serious conditions such as leukemia, myeloproliferative disorders, or solid tumors, and warrants further evaluation [^9f616c47] [^cfa0243f]. Mild, transient ANC rises are usually reactive and resolve with treatment of the underlying cause, but sustained elevations require a focused workup to exclude hematologic disease [^aae46601].

---

## Physiological and common causes of increased ANC

Several **physiological and common pathological conditions** can cause an increase in ANC:

- **Infection**: Bacterial infections are the most common cause of increased ANC, as neutrophils are the primary defense against bacteria [^aae46601].

- **Inflammation**: Chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and gout can cause persistent neutrophilia [^aae46601].

- **Stress and corticosteroids**: Physical or emotional stress, as well as corticosteroid therapy, can cause a transient increase in ANC by mobilizing neutrophils from the marginated pool [^aae46601].

- **Tissue injury or surgery**: Trauma, burns, or surgical procedures can trigger a neutrophil response [^aae46601].

---

## Clinical significance of increased ANC

The clinical significance of an increased ANC depends on the **magnitude and persistence** of the elevation:

| **Anc level (cells/µl)** | **Clinical significance** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild increase (7,000–10,000) | Usually reactive and benign | - Infection <br/> - Inflammation <br/> - Stress <br/> - Corticosteroids |
| Moderate increase (10,000–20,000) | Suggests significant infection, inflammation, or medication effect | - Severe bacterial infection <br/> - Chronic inflammation <br/> - Corticosteroids |
| Marked increase (> 20,000) | Concerning for hematologic malignancy or severe systemic illness | - Leukemia <br/> - Myeloproliferative disorders <br/> - Solid tumors <br/> - Severe sepsis |

---

Persistent neutrophilia (> 10,000/µL for > 4 weeks) warrants further evaluation to exclude **underlying hematologic disorders** or malignancies [^notfound].

---

## Potential health risks associated with increased ANC

While an increased ANC is often a protective response, persistent or marked elevations can indicate **underlying health risks**:

- **Infection severity**: Very high ANC levels are associated with severe infections, including sepsis, and correlate with worse outcomes in conditions such as COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia [^0a8c9842] [^4557dd04].

- **Inflammatory diseases**: Chronic neutrophilia is linked to increased risk of cardiovascular events, stroke, and progression of chronic inflammatory diseases [^8081f36b] [^374b4c7b].

- **Hematologic malignancies**: Persistent neutrophilia can be a sign of leukemia or myeloproliferative disorders, which require prompt diagnosis and treatment [^9f616c47].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation of increased ANC

When evaluating a patient with increased ANC, the following **diagnostic approach** is recommended:

- **Confirm the elevation**: Repeat CBC with differential to confirm persistent neutrophilia [^notfound].

- **History and physical examination**: Identify potential causes such as infection, inflammation, medication use, or hematologic symptoms [^aae46601].

- **Laboratory tests**: CRP, ESR, and specific tests based on clinical suspicion (e.g. autoimmune panels, infectious disease screening) [^notfound].

- **Bone marrow biopsy**: Indicated if hematologic malignancy is suspected or if neutrophilia is unexplained and persistent [^0f86821a].

---

## Management strategies

Management of increased ANC focuses on **treating the underlying cause**:

- **Infection**: Appropriate antibiotic therapy and supportive care [^d56b3c34].

- **Inflammation**: Control of the underlying inflammatory condition with anti-inflammatory medications or immunosuppressive therapy [^notfound].

- **Medication-induced neutrophilia**: Adjustment or discontinuation of the offending medication if feasible [^notfound].

- **Hematologic malignancies**: Specialized oncology care, including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or stem cell transplantation [^notfound].

---

An increase in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reflects a higher neutrophil level, most often due to infection, inflammation, or stress. Persistent or marked elevations may signal serious disease and require **targeted evaluation** to guide management.

### Definition of ANC-NCI dictionary of cancer terms… [^821b7fa0]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

ANCA measure of the number of neutrophils in the blood. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell. They help the body fight infection. An ANC may be used to check for infection, inflammation, leukemia, and other conditions. The lower a person's ANC is, the higher the risk is of getting an infection. Having an ANC of less than 500 means there is a high risk of getting an infection. Cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy, may reduce the ANC. Also called absolute neutrophil count.

Neutropenia is a common reason for hematology consultations in the inpatient and outpatient settings and is defined as an absolute neutrophil count less than 1500 cells/μL. Neutropenia varies in severity, with more profound neutropenia being associated with higher rates of infections and infection-related deaths. The causes for neutropenia are diverse and include congenital and acquired conditions (ie, autoimmune, drugs, infection, and malignancy). This article outlines the most common causes of neutropenia and discusses differential diagnoses, treatment modalities, and the mechanisms by which neutropenia occurs.

### How to approach neutropenia [^de67e2d9]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Neutropenia is defined as the reduction in the absolute number of neutrophils in the blood circulation. Acute neutropenia is a relatively frequent finding, whereas disorders of production of neutrophils are quite rare. Acute neutropenia is often well tolerated and normalizes rapidly. Neutropenia arising as a result of underlying hematologic disorders is far more significant. Such a patient may be at risk for infectious complications and will likely require a thorough investigation. Acute neutropenia evolves over a few days and occurs when neutrophil use is rapid and production is impaired. Chronic neutropenia may last for 3 months or longer and is a result of reduced production, increased destruction, or excessive splenic sequestration of neutrophils. Neutropenia may be classified by whether it arises secondarily to causes extrinsic to BM myeloid cells, which is common; as an acquired disorder of myeloid progenitor cells, which is less frequent; or as an intrinsic defect arising from impaired proliferation and maturation of myeloid progenitor cells in the BM, which is rare. Severe neutropenia with absolute neutrophil counts below 500/μL increases susceptibility to bacterial or fungal infections. Multiple disorders of severe congenital neutropenia have been found by the discovery of genetic defects affecting differentiation, adhesion, and apoptosis of neutrophil precursors. Elucidation of the multiple genetic defects have provided insight into the biology of the cell involving membrane structures, secretory vesicles, mitochondrial metabolism, ribosome biogenesis, transcriptional regulation, and cytoskeletal dynamics, as well as the risk for myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia.

### Diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making for the neutropenic patient [^0f86821a]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Determining the cause of a low neutrophil count in a pediatric or adult patient is essential for the hematologist's clinical decision-making. Fundamental to this diagnostic process is establishing the presence or lack of a mature neutrophil storage pool, as absence places the patient at higher risk for infection and the need for supportive care measures. Many diagnostic tests, eg, a peripheral blood smear and bone marrow biopsy, remain important tools, but greater understanding of the diversity of neutropenic disorders has added new emphasis on evaluating for immune disorders and genetic testing. In this article, a structure is provided to assess patients based on the mechanism of neutropenia and to prioritize testing based on patient age and hypothesized pathophysiology. Common medical quandaries including fever management, need for growth factor support, risk of malignant transformation, and curative options in congenital neutropenia are reviewed to guide medical decision-making in neutropenic patients.

### Incidental neutropenia: an emergency medicine focused approach [^0e507514]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1500 cells/microL and may be discovered incidentally in an asymptomatic, afebrile patient.

Objective

This narrative review provides an approach to the afebrile emergency department patient with incidental neutropenia.

Discussion

Neutropenia is an ANC < 1500 cells/microL, with mild neutropenia defined as an ANC ≥ 1000 to < 1500 cells/microL, moderate ≥ 500 to < 1000 cells/microL, severe < 500 cells/microL, and agranulocytosis < 200 cells/microL. Incidental or isolated neutropenia is an ANC < 1500 cells/microL discovered on laboratory testing unrelated to the patient's chief complaint (e.g., chest pain, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, etc.) and not associated with fever or infectious signs and symptoms. There are a variety of etiologies, with inherited forms, dose-dependent drug-induced neutropenia, and infections the most common causes. Testing includes complete blood count with differential and peripheral smear. Management is based on the patient's hemodynamic status, presence of fever, severity of neutropenia, and the peripheral smear. Patients who are critically ill, febrile, have severe neutropenia, or have a concerning peripheral smear (schistocytes, atypical lymphocytes) should undergo hematology consultation. Those with critical illness or fever with neutropenia should receive broad-spectrum antibiotics. Patients who are afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and non-toxic appearing with mild or moderate neutropenia can likely be discharged for repeat testing in one to two weeks.

Conclusion

Understanding the approach to incidental neutropenia can improve patient care. Critically ill or febrile patients should be admitted, but select patients may be discharged.

### How I manage inpatient consultations for quantitative neutrophil abnormalities in adults [^aae46601]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Neutrophilia and neutropenia commonly lead to inpatient hematology consultation. Quantitative neutrophil abnormalities have a broad differential and include diagnoses that are important to recognize because they may be associated with increased mortality. Neutrophilia can reflect etiologies such as infection, medications, inflammation, splenectomy, and congenital disorders. Neutropenia can arise from infection, medications, autoimmune destruction, sequestration, nutritional deficiency, malignancy, and congenital neutropenia syndromes. In the evaluation of all abnormalities of neutrophil number, the timing of the change, and the patient's historical neutrophil count are crucial.

### Mediation and longitudinal analysis to interpret the association between clozapine pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenomics, and absolute neutrophil count [^b400406b]. Schizophrenia (2023). Medium credibility.

Clozapine is effective at reducing symptoms of treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but it can also induce several adverse outcomes including neutropenia and agranulocytosis. We used linear mixed-effect models and structural equation modelling to determine whether pharmacokinetic and genetic variables influence absolute neutrophil count in a longitudinal UK-based sample of clozapine users not currently experiencing neutropenia (N = 811). Increased daily clozapine dose was associated with elevated neutrophil count, amounting to a 133 cells/mm³ rise per standard deviation increase in clozapine dose. One-third of the total effect of clozapine dose was mediated by plasma clozapine and norclozapine levels, which themselves demonstrated opposing, independent associations with absolute neutrophil count. Finally, CYP1A2 pharmacogenomic activity score was associated with absolute neutrophil count, supporting lower neutrophil levels in CYP1A2 poor metabolisers during clozapine use. This information may facilitate identifying at-risk patients and then introducing preventative interventions or individualised pharmacovigilance procedures to help mitigate these adverse haematological reactions.

### Does absolute neutrophil count predict high tumor grade in African-American men with prostate cancer? [^2d74e458]. The Prostate (2012). Low credibility.

Background

African-Americans (AA) are at risk for benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN), which has been implicated as a potential source of disparity in cancer outcomes among AAs. Since AAs with prostate cancer (PCa) are more likely to have aggressive pathological features, this investigation sought to determine if absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is associated with adverse pathologic findings at radical prostatectomy (RP) within a cohort of AA men.

Methods

A single-institution, retrospective review was conducted of all AA patients undergoing RP who had a pre-operative CBC with differential and known RP pathology. Neutropenia was defined as ANC ≤ 1.5×10⁹/L (1.5). Clinical and pathologic variables were characterized for the study cohort, and Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses performed to evaluate the association between ANC and adverse pathology.

Results

A total of 336 patients were included, and 18 patients (5.4%) had ANC ≤ 1.5. Mean age was 59.8 ± 7.5 years; mean follow-up time 47.4 ± 43.3 months. Neutropenic patients had significantly higher clinical stages and pathologic Gleason scores (P < 0.05). On multivariable analysis, ANC ≤ 1.5 was significantly predictive of high tumor grade (HR 1.22, CI 1.01–1.48).

Conclusions

Neutropenia in AAs predicts high tumor grade at prostatectomy. Further studies are necessary to further characterize the importance of these findings with regard to the pathogenesis of PCa, particularly as it relates to the AA population.

### Full-dose chemotherapy in early stage breast cancer regardless of absolute neutrophil count and without G-CSF does not increase chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia [^6b523720]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Does giving full-dose adjuvant chemotherapy to patients with early stage breast cancer (ESBC) regardless of the day-before absolute neutrophil count (ANC) lead to an increased incidence of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia (CIFN)? What factors may predispose patients to CIFN?

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review conducted on all patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for ESBC at a mid-sized community hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada between September 2005 and August 2011. Day-before CBC data were collected along with other patient characteristics. CIFN was confirmed by hospital records. One hundred fifty-four patients met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 830 cycles of chemotherapy were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for CIFN.

Results

Twenty-two episodes of CIFN were observed. There was no significant difference in day-before ANC between patients who developed CIFN relative to those who did not. The day-before ANC was < 1.5×10⁹/L for 88 cycles of chemotherapy. ANC analyzed as a continuous variable showed that the odds ratio (OR) for CIFN was 0.97 (95% CI 0.82–1.13, p = NS). The pseudo R² statistic, which is a measure of variability accounted for by a regression model, was only 0.0008, indicating that ANC explained less than 1% of the variability in the risk of CIFN. The most significant predictor of CIFN was the chemotherapy regimen, with docetaxel (Taxotere)/cyclophosphamide demonstrating the highest risk (OR 7.1, 95% CI 1.4–34.9, p = 0.016).

Conclusions

Full-dose adjuvant chemotherapy may be given to patients with ESBC regardless of the day-before ANC, without significantly increasing the risk of CIFN. The chemotherapy regimen is the most significant predictor for CIFN.

### Blood neutrophil counts are associated with exacerbation frequency and mortality in COPD [^df46f489]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Biomarkers are needed in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) for effective risk stratification and to guide personalized treatment. Blood eosinophil counts have been extensively investigated to stratify patients with COPD, based on evidence that blood and sputum eosinophil counts are linked, and both are associated with increased exacerbation frequency, reduced lung function and responsiveness to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Only a minority of COPD patients, however, exhibit eosinophilia; COPD is predominantly characterized as a neutrophilic inflammatory disorder; because the most abundant inflammatory cell in blood and sputum is the neutrophil, and because neutrophil proteases can recapitulate many of the features of COPD in disease models, such as emphysema and mucus hypersecretion. The introduction of blood eosinophil counts into clinical practice recommendations from GOLD illustrates the potential for simple clinical measures to come into daily practice, but whether blood neutrophil counts (BNC) can be used to inform clinical decisions has not been extensively investigated in large cohorts.

Increased peripheral neutrophil counts are a reflection of systemic inflammation which is linked to disease severity and co-morbidities in COPD. Correlations between disease severity stage and neutrophil activation markers (e.g. neutrophil elastase (NE), myeloperoxidase and neutrophil extracellular traps) in sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage have been shown previously.

We therefore hypothesized that BNC would be a predictor of COPD severity, exacerbation and mortality.

### Prevalence and clinical significance of neutropenia discovered in routine complete blood cell counts: a longitudinal study [^3468596d]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Neutropenia, defined as an absolute blood neutrophil count (ANC) < 1.5 G L(-1), may accompany a variety of diseases. However, the clinical significance of neutropenia detected in a routine complete blood cell count is poorly understood.

Methods

Using a primary care resource, comprising more than 370 000 individuals, we assessed the association with a number of previously recognized conditions as well as all-cause mortality in the 4 years following the identification of neutropenia. By matching laboratory data with Danish nationwide health registers, risk estimates were assessed.

Results

Neutropenia was observed in approximately 1% of all individuals and was associated dose dependently with viral infections, haematological malignancies (but not autoimmune disorders or solid cancers) and mortality. Neutropenia was particularly associated with HIV, acute leukaemias and myelodysplastic syndromes. Odds ratios [95% confidence interval (CI)] for viral infections were 2.32 (1.84–2.91), 2.80 (2.20–3.57) and 4.77 (3.22–7.07) for subnormal (≥ 1.5–1.8 G L(-1)), mild (≥ 1.0–1.5 G L(-1)) and moderate-severe (≥ 0.0–1.0 G L(-1)) neutropenic individuals, respectively (all P < 0.001). Likewise, odds ratios (95% CI) for haematological malignancies were 3.23 (2.35–4.45), 8.69 (6.58–11.47) and 46.03 (33.98–62.35), for the same neutropenia levels, respectively (all P < 0.001). Thus, the lower the ANC, the greater the likelihood of these diseases. The relative risk estimates observed for severe neutropenia corresponded to absolute risks of haematological malignancies and mortality from any cause of 40% and > 50%, respectively.

Conclusions

Neutropenia is an ominous sign necessitating careful follow-up. The risk estimates presented here support focusing attention to viral diseases and haematological malignancies when neutropenia is observed.

### Clinical practice guideline for the use of antimicrobial agents in neutropenic patients with cancer: 2010 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^825df6d4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for febrile neutropenia, more specifically with respect to risk assessment (general principles), IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend to consider regarding patients with anticipated prolonged (> 7 days duration) and profound neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count ≤ 100/mcL following cytotoxic chemotherapy) and/or significant medical comorbid conditions (including hypotension, pneumonia, new-onset abdominal pain, or neurologic changes) as high-risk patients. Admit such patients initially to the hospital for empirical therapy.

### Predictive value of neutrophils count for local tumor control after chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma [^9940386e]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Baseline neutrophil count may predict overall survival (OS) in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC).

Methods and Materials

The international multicenter randomized LAP07 phase 3 trial has enrolled 442 patients with LAPC. We analyzed the prognostic value of both baseline neutrophilia (neutrophil count > 7 g/L) and elevated or increasing neutrophil count as (1) neutrophilia or (2) increased absolute neutrophil count after induction chemotherapy versus baseline for OS, progression-free survival, and local control (LC). A Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess elevated or increasing neutrophil count status by randomly assigned treatment interactions for each endpoint.

Results

Among the 442 patients, 47 patients (11%) with baseline neutrophilia had worse OS (median 8.9 vs 13.3 months; P = 0.01). After induction chemotherapy, among the 235 patients whose blood counts were available, 90 patients (38%) had elevated or increasing neutrophil count associated with poorer OS in univariate (median 14.4 vs 17.9 months; P = 0.001) and multivariate analysis (P = 0.004). Elevated or increasing neutrophil count was also predictive of a decreased benefit of chemoradiation therapy on LC. In 126 patients without elevated or increasing neutrophil count, 1-year LC was 80% in the chemoradiation arm versus 54% in the chemotherapy arm (P < .001; interaction test P = 0.015).

Conclusions

In this study, baseline neutrophilia and increased absolute neutrophil count were associated with worse OS in this large series of patients with LAPC. In addition, the counts were an independent prognosis factor and a strong predictive LC biomarker for chemoradiation therapy benefit. An assessment of neutrophils counts can help to improve the selection of patients who might benefit from chemoradiation therapy after induction chemotherapy.

### Neutrophil elastase inhibitors: a potential prophylactic treatment option for SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory complications? [^5b4f19bf]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

As the death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 continues to mount globally, scientists, healthcare agencies, and pharmaceutical companies are trying hard to find a "cure" and devise treatment strategies to reduce mortality. "Repurposing" existing drugs to fight COVID-19 remains an important strategy. Since respiratory failure remains one of the leading causes of death in COVID-19 patients, in this commentary, we have critically discussed the potential benefit of neutrophil elastase inhibitors (NEIs) in patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19.

Around one in three COVID-19 patients admitted to a hospital develop systemic inflammatory conditions such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Since lymphocytopenia is often reported in severe COVID-19 patients, it suggests that systemic inflammatory complications, associated with disease severity and mortality, are likely to be mediated by leukocytes other than T cells. The drop in lymphocyte count is accompanied by an increase in neutrophil count and a decrease in monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils, indicating that, together with lymphocytopenia, increased neutrophil count and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio may be important predictors of disease severity in COVID-19 patients. A recent case study supported this hypothesis. The patient's deterioration on day 12 of illness was preceded by an elevation in his neutrophil count on day 11, while lymphocytes and monocytes remained low. Given that there is often a short window between the time of hospital admission and development of ARDS in severe cases, a rapid prophylactic therapy is warranted to effectively prevent complications and death.

### Safety and efficacy of a CXCR2 antagonist in patients with severe asthma and sputum neutrophils: a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^00803eab]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Increased numbers of neutrophils are reported in the airways of patients with severe asthma. It is not clear if they contribute to the lack of control and severity. There are currently no strategies to investigate this by decreasing neutrophil numbers in the airways.

Objective

To investigate the safety and efficacy of SCH527123, a selective CXCR2 receptor antagonist, in patients with severe asthma and increased number of neutrophils in sputum.

Methods

In a randomized, double-blind, parallel study, patients with severe asthma and sputum total cell count < 10 × 10⁶/g and neutrophils > 40% were randomized to SCH527123, 30 mg daily PO (n = 22) or placebo (n = 12) for 4 weeks. Primary end-points were safety and change in sputum and blood neutrophil counts. Secondary end-points were change in asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) score, minor and major exacerbations, spirometry and sputum neutrophil activation markers.

Results

The SCH 527123 caused a mean reduction of 36.3% in sputum neutrophil percentage compared to a 6.7% increase in the placebo arm (P = 0.03). The mean absolute neutrophil count in blood was reduced by 14% at the end of 4 weeks, but recovered by the 5th week. There were no differences in the overall rates of adverse events among the groups. There were fewer mild exacerbations (1.3 vs. 2.25, P = 0.05) and a trend towards improvement in the ACQ score (mean difference between groups of 0.42 points, P = 0.053). No statistically significant changes were observed in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV₁), sputum myeloperoxidase, IL8 or elastase.

Conclusions

The SCH527123 is safe and reduces sputum neutrophils in patients with severe asthma.

Clinical Relevance

This new treatment provides an opportunity to investigate the role of neutrophils in severe asthma with potential clinical benefits. Larger studies of longer duration are needed to evaluate the impact on other outcomes of asthma including exacerbations.

### Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and cancer prognosis: an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies [^0f8a45e7]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Causal association

This umbrella review does not address causality directly and cannot determine whether the association between neutrophils and poor prognosis in cancer is causal or due to confounding or reverse causation. Previous studies have highlighted the paradoxical role of neutrophils in both tumour progression and suppression. Our study suggests that the overall effect of high NLR could be tumourigenic in certain cases, but further work is required to assess this.

Our study supports the relationship between elevated NLR and poor outcomes in cancer in terms of effect size and consistency of findings. We cannot address temporality as the studies included measured biomarkers before the initiation of treatment but after diagnosis. The biological mechanisms behind inflammation and cancer progression could suggest temporality, as elevated NLR and TAN are proposed to promote increased cell proliferation, angiogenesis and risk of metastasis as contributors to poor prognosis.

Clinical significance and future research

Future research should focus on strengthening the current evidence base for specific cancers which displayed suggestive and highly suggestive associations, addressing heterogeneity and small-study issues. Unveiling a causal association between neutrophils and cancer outcomes could lead to cancer treatments which involve neutrophils as a therapeutic target and validate the NLR as a prognostic biomarker in cancer. A causal association between neutrophils and poor prognosis could give further insight into experimental therapy which lowers neutrophil counts in the body to improve outcomes in cancer. Sub-group analysis suggested that the magnitude and direction of effect of NLR on cancer outcomes was robust to adjustment for additional prognostic factors. Regardless, consensus on a minimum set of covariates to adjust for is needed. Furthermore, the dose response relationship between NLR and prognosis remains unclear. Within the included papers, only two of the 86 conducted a dose response analysis. Future work should consider whether the association is linear or has threshold effects. In light of the variation observed in meta-regressions of NLR cut-off and effect size, identification of a clinically relevant NLR cut-off could be specific to different cancer sites and may be affected by treatment. Future systematic reviews should consider performing individual patient data (IPD) meta-analyses to allow for the assessment of NLR values on a continuous scale.

### Circulating neutrophils levels are a predictor of pneumonia risk in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^4557dd04]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Across eight of the 10 clinical studies included within this analysis, increased circulating neutrophils in patients with stable COPD were associated with an increased risk of pneumonia. A greater incidence of pneumonia was observed in patients with baseline blood neutrophil counts at or above the median value when compared with those below the median. As has been shown previously, the ICS-containing therapies conveyed an increased risk of pneumonia versus those without ICS. Notably, however, the difference in pneumonia risk between patients at or above the median neutrophil count versus those below the median remained consistent regardless of the presence of ICS. Furthermore, the interaction test for the effects of ICS and neutrophil counts was found to be non-significant. Taken together, these results suggest that blood neutrophils could potentially be a useful biomarker for informing physicians if a patient has a high risk of pneumonia, when considering ICS therapy. It should be noted that this is the first study to investigate the use of neutrophil count as a potential biomarker for pneumonia risk in patients with COPD.

In addition to neutrophils, studies have demonstrated that eosinophils are biomarkers that also have potential to assess COPD-related pneumonia events, but the association between eosinophils and pneumonia risk may not be as clear as that between neutrophils and pneumonia risk. With this in mind, it is possible that blood neutrophil count may be a more reliable indicator of pneumonia risk in patients with COPD than blood eosinophil count, but further research would be of benefit in support of this claim.

This study provides evidence of a clear association between raised neutrophil counts and increased pneumonia risk but does not provide any information on the reason behind the association. In line with other meta-analyses in this area of research, where associations are identified and hypotheses generated, further investigations in appropriately designed studies to evaluate the potential role of other variables, including the role of concomitant comorbidities, are crucially needed. It is interesting to note that patients with neutrophil counts above and below the median had strikingly similar demographics and, importantly, exacerbation and hospitalization rates prior to study entry. A possible link between pneumonia and neutrophil counts could be the presence of potentially pathogenic airway bacteria driving both a neutrophilic response and an increased risk of pneumonia. However, the lack of a relationship between neutrophil levels and exacerbation rates is somewhat discordant with this hypothesis, and only further studies of the airway microbiome, infection risk and neutrophil counts are likely to elucidate the nature of this relationship.

### Clozapine [^b9772091]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Severe Neutropenia

Background

Clozapine can cause neutropenia (a low absolute neutrophil count (ANC)), defined as a reduction below pre-treatment normal levels of blood neutrophils. The ANC is usually available as a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant to drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be calculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total percentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil "segs" plus neutrophil "bands"). Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia and their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Neutropenia may be mild, moderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, "severe neutropenia" replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or agranulocytosis.

Severe neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/μL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking clozapine and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then declines. The mechanism by which clozapine causes neutropenia is unknown and is not dose-dependent.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^f334dff4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in neutropenia — no recommendation for high-risk neutropenia; low-risk patients have very small infection risk. In patients with high-risk neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 100 cells/mm³), ≥ 7 days' duration following chemotherapy), we make no recommendation for or against screening for or treatment of ASB (knowledge gap). For patients with high-risk neutropenia managed with current standards of care, it is unclear how frequently ASB occurs and how often it progresses to symptomatic UTI. Patients with low-risk neutropenia (> 100 cells/mm³, ≤ 7 days, clinically stable) have only a very small risk of infection.

### Absolute neutrophil count by duffy status among healthy black and African American adults [^3e54c2b7]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Many people of African ancestry have lower absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) without increased risk for infection. This is associated with the Duffy-null phenotype (nonexpression of the Duffy antigen on red blood cells), which is commonly found in those of African descent. Currently, there are no studies that compare the ANC of individuals with Duffy-null phenotype to those with Duffy non-null phenotypes within a self-identified Black population. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of Duffy status on ANCs based on complete blood counts with differential and Duffy testing in a healthy population of self-identified Black individuals at a single primary care center. This study found that 66.7% (80 of 120) of Black individuals have the Duffy-null phenotype and that there is a significant difference in ANCs between Duffy-null and Duffy non-null individuals (median, 2820 cells per μL vs 5005 cells per μL; P < .001). Additionally, 19 of 80 (23.8%) Duffy-null individuals had an ANC of < 2000 cells per μL compared with no (0) Duffy non-null individuals. The Duffy-null phenotype is clinically insignificant; however, inappropriate reference ranges can propagate systemic racism. Therefore, we advocate for the development of Duffy-null-specific ANC reference ranges as well as replacing the term benign ethnic neutropenia with Duffy-nullassociated neutrophil count.

### How I manage children with neutropenia [^6aa3f21f]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Neutropenia, usually defined as a blood neutrophil count < 1·5 × 10⁹/l, is a common medical problem for children and adults. There are many causes for neutropenia, and at each stage in life the clinical pattern of causes and consequences differs significantly. I recommend utilizing the age of the child and clinical observations for the preliminary diagnosis and primary management. In premature infants, neutropenia is quite common and contributes to the risk of sepsis with necrotizing enterocolitis. At birth and for the first few months of life, neutropenia is often attributable to isoimmune or alloimmune mechanisms and predisposes to the risk of severe bacterial infections. Thereafter when a child is discovered to have neutropenia, often associated with relatively minor symptoms, it is usually attributed to autoimmune disorder or viral infection. The congenital neutropenia syndromes are usually recognized when there are recurrent infections, the neutropenia is severe and there are congenital anomalies suggesting a genetic disorder. This review focuses on the key clinical finding and laboratory tests for diagnosis with commentaries on treatment, particularly the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor to treat childhood neutropenia.

### Definition of absolute neutrophil count-NCI dictionary… [^64933317]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

absolute neutrophil countListen to pronunciationA measure of the number of neutrophils in the blood. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell. They help the body fight infection. An absolute neutrophil count may be used to check for infection, inflammation, leukemia, and other conditions. The lower a person's absolute neutrophil count is, the higher the risk is of getting an infection. Having an absolute neutrophil count of less than 500 means there is a high risk of getting an infection. Cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy, may reduce the absolute neutrophil count. Also called ANC.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^dd135df1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

IX. Neutropenia — screening or treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB): In patients with high-risk neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] < 100 cells/mm3, ≥ 7 days' duration, following cytotoxic chemotherapy) we make no recommendation for or against screening for or treatment of ASB (knowledge gap). For patients with high-risk neutropenia (ANC < 100 cells/mm3, ≥ 7 days following cytotoxic chemotherapy) managed with current standards of care, including prophylactic antimicrobial therapy and prompt initiation of antimicrobial therapy when febrile illness occurs, it is unclear how frequently ASB occurs and how often it progresses to symptomatic UTI. Patients with low-risk neutropenia (> 100 cells/mm3, ≤ 7 days, clinically stable) have only a very small risk of infection, and there is no evidence to suggest that, in this population, ASB has greater risk than for nonneutropenic populations. Early prospective studies undertaken before antimicrobial prophylaxis became a standard of care for patients with high-risk neutropenia (≥ 7 days duration, ≤ 100 cells/mm3, following cytotoxic chemotherapy) are referenced in the evidence summary.

### The diagnostic value of absolute neutrophil count, band count and morphologic changes of neutrophils in predicting bacterial infections [^5dba37ea]. Medical Principles and Practice (2007). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC)" for febrile neutropenia.

The Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) is a clinical calculator used primarily in the field of hematology and oncology. It is applicable to patients who have undergone chemotherapy, those with suspected neutropenia, or those at risk for severe infection due to immunosuppression. The ANC is calculated from the total white blood cell count and the percentage of neutrophils, providing a measure of the body's primary defense against bacterial infections.

The clinical utility of the ANC lies in its ability to assess the severity of neutropenia and the risk of infection in patients. It is particularly useful in monitoring patients undergoing chemotherapy, as these individuals are at a high risk for neutropenia and subsequent infection.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the ANC. However, it should be noted that the ANC may not accurately reflect the risk of infection in patients with conditions that cause functional neutrophil defects, such as chronic granulomatous disease. Additionally, the ANC may be less useful in patients with conditions that cause neutrophilia, such as corticosteroid use or acute stress, as these conditions can artificially elevate the neutrophil count.

### The prognostic impact of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in patients with small-cell lung cancer [^6698c69d]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

A high NLR indicates an increased neutrophil count and/or a decreased lymphocyte count, as well as relative lymphopaenia. Lymphocytes have a crucial role in tumour defence by inducing cytotoxic cell death and inhibiting tumour cell proliferation and migration. In contrast, large numbers of neutrophils affect the cytolytic activity of lymphocytes or natural killer cells and could negatively affect tumour growth. In addition to the TANs described above, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are fibres composed of chromatin and neutrophil proteins, are known to be associated with cancer. TANs are more prone to NETs than their normal counterparts. An experimental study demonstrated that widespread deposition of NETs induced by sepsis sequesters circulating tumour cells and promotes metastasis. NETs may protect circulating tumour cells by adhering to them and recruiting platelets. These theoretical considerations support the role of NLR, reflecting the extent of neutrophilia in malignancy.

NLR is an easily measurable and repeatable parameter and thus clinically useful. However, several problems exist. NLR may occasionally not be a tumour-specific marker because other inflammatory conditions and steroid treatments could be confounding factors. Some authors have suggested that NLR should be assessed together with other inflammatory markers such as CRP. In addition, numerous articles have reported on NLR using different cutoff levels that require validation. In a study that showed a significant correlation between the NLR and survival in patients with stage IV gastric cancer, the authors used a NLR level of 2.5 and median survival was significantly longer in the group with a low-NLR level. Other studies reported a correlation between NLR and survival, using various cutoff values.

This study had several limitations. First, the sample size was relatively small, which limits generalising our findings. Second, as with all retrospective studies, there are several limitations inherent to its design, including the retrospective data collection. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, this is the first study to suggest the usefulness of NLR and investigate the prognostic role of NLR in SCLC patients.

In conclusion, NLR at the time of diagnosis is a readily available and effective measurement that reflects the prognosis in SCLC patients. NLR determination during treatment and monitoring may help in assessing the treatment response and predicting recurrence. Further prospective studies are needed to evaluate cutoff values and confirm our results.

### Utility of symptom duration and C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, and absolute neutrophil count in the evaluation of pediatric appendicitis [^031de284]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Appendicitis is a common pediatric surgical emergency, and the diagnosis may be delayed or missed because of nonspecific findings in children. Not all patients with abdominal pain need to be imaged for appendicitis, and laboratory evaluation may improve diagnostic accuracy in this population.

Objective

To determine if C-reactive protein (CRP) and symptom duration could be used to improve diagnosis of appendicitis compared with white blood cell count (WBC) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC).

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review from June 2017 to 2019 at our tertiary academic children's hospital. A consecutive sample of all children < 18 years of age being evaluated for appendicitis who had magnetic resonance imaging ordered were included. The diagnostic accuracy of WBC, ANC, and CRP were compared for patients with symptom duration ≤ 1 day compared with symptom duration for > 1 day.

Results

Five hundred thirty-nine patients were identified. The sensitivity and specificity of WBC (10,000 cells/μL) was 87.1% and 65.2%, respectively; ANC (7,500 cells/μL) was 86.5% and 70.8%, respectively; and CRP (0.5 mg/dL) were 73.7% and 58.1%, respectively. At > 1 day of symptom duration, the specificity of WBC and ANC increased to 74.9% and 80.9%, respectively, and the sensitivity of CRP increased to 88.9%. Three patients with appendicitis (2.8%) had no laboratory abnormalities.

Conclusions

No laboratory test studied has adequate characteristics to be used alone. CRP adds minimal sensitivity beyond WBC and ANC when symptoms are > 1 day but with poor specificity, making it of limited utility.

### Paediatric autoimmune neutropaenia [^a809632c]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Neutropaenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 1500cells/µL and is often divided into mild (ANC: 1000 to 1500cells/µL), moderate (ANC: 500 to 1000cells/µL) and severe (ANC: > 500cells/µL) neutropaenia. Autoimmune neutropaenia is arguably one of the most clinically relevant forms of neutropaenia and is defined by an ANC of < 500cells/µL alongside the confirmed presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies. It is a rare subset of neutropaenia boasting an incidence of just 1 in 100000 infants and is thought to be caused as a result of a 'surveillance escape event' of the immune system. This case report identifies key issues in the diagnosis and monitoring of paediatric patients with recurrent neutropaenia and reviews current literature relating to its management in hospital and community settings.

### Mediterranean diet, neutrophil count, and carotid intima-media thickness in secondary prevention: the CORDIOPREV study [^374b4c7b]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Several studies have supported the role of innate immune system as a key factor in the sterile inflammation underlying the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis in mice. However, its involvement in humans remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the association between neutrophil count, and the intima-media thickness of common carotid arteries (IMT-CC), as well as the potential impact of long-term dietary interventions on these associations.

Methods

A comprehensive analysis was conducted within the framework of the CORDIOPREV study, a long-term secondary prevention study involving dietary interventions with either a Mediterranean or a low-fat diet. The study evaluated the relationship between absolute neutrophil count and neutrophil-related ratios with IMT-CC at baseline and after 5 and 7 years of dietary intervention.

Results

At baseline, patients in the highest tertile of neutrophil count had a higher IMT-CC and number of carotid plaques, when compared to lowest tertile (P < .01 and P < .05, respectively). Logistic regression analyses supported this association. Elevated neutrophil count, neutrophil-to-erythrocyte ratio, and neutrophil-to-HDL ratio were associated with an increased likelihood of having an IMT-CC > .9mm {odds ratio (OR) 1.17 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04–1.35], OR 2.21 (95% CI 1.24–4.12), and OR 1.96 (95% CI 1.09–3.55), respectively}, after adjustment for all variables, which was corroborated by linear regression. Furthermore, a linear mixed-effect model analysis from a longitudinal analysis spanning 5 and 7 years revealed an increase in 1 unit of neutrophils/μl at these time points was associated with a mean increase of .004 (.002) mm in the IMT-CC (P = 0.031) after adjustment for all variables. Interestingly, in patients exhibiting regression in IMT-CC after 7 years of follow-up, those following a Mediterranean diet showed a significant decrease in neutrophil count after 5 and 7 years (both with P < .05), compared to baseline.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that neutrophils may represent a promising target for preventing atherosclerosis. A Mediterranean diet could serve as an effective dietary strategy to reduce neutrophil levels and potentially slow the progression of atherosclerosis, offering a new neutrophil-reducing therapy concept. Further research is essential to gain deeper insights into the role of neutrophils in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in humans.

### Don't miss the diagnosis of sepsis! [^d56b3c34]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is amongst the most common reasons for admission to ICUs throughout the world. The early detection and timely administration of appropriate antibiotics are the most important factors in improving the outcome of patients with sepsis. However, the initial signs and symptoms of sepsis are frequently non-specific, leading to a delay in diagnosis. Furthermore, the diagnostic characteristics of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) are not useful in distinguishing infectious from non-infectious causes of SIRS. An elevated white blood count, neutrophilia or eosinopenia are frequently used to diagnose bacterial sepsis; however, these variables have low diagnostic value.

### Clinical practice guideline for the use of antimicrobial agents in neutropenic patients with cancer: 2010 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^58e7672a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for febrile neutropenia" for febrile neutropenia.

The Diagnostic Criteria for Febrile Neutropenia is a clinical tool designed to identify patients with a high risk of infection due to a significant decrease in the number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, in conjunction with fever. This tool is particularly useful in the management of patients undergoing chemotherapy or other treatments that suppress the immune system, as these individuals are at an increased risk of developing febrile neutropenia.

The primary components of this diagnostic criteria include both fever and neutropenia. Fever is defined either as a single oral temperature measurement of ≥ 38.3 degrees C (101 degrees F) or a temperature of ≥ 38.0 degrees C (100.4 degrees F) sustained over a 1-hour period. Neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count ≤ 500/mcL or an absolute neutrophil count expected to decrease to < 500/mcL during the next 48 hours.

The diagnosis of febrile neutropenia is established if the patient meets either of the fever criteria (A or B) and either of the neutropenia criteria (C or D). If the patient does not meet these criteria, the diagnosis of febrile neutropenia is not established. This tool aids clinicians in making a prompt diagnosis, which is crucial for initiating appropriate treatment and improving patient outcomes.

The febrile neutropenia diagnostic tool assesses whether a patient meets the criteria for febrile neutropenia based on their fever and neutrophil count levels. This requires two specific determinations from the user:

1. **Fever**:
- A single oral temperature reading of 38.3°C (101°F) or higher.
- A temperature of at least 38.0°C (100.4°F) sustained over a period of one hour.

2. **Neutropenia**:
- An absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 500/microliter (mcL) or less.
- An ANC expected to drop below 500/mcL within the subsequent 48 hours.

The diagnostic process evaluates these criteria as follows:

- For fever, if either criterion is satisfied (a single high measurement or sustained elevated temperature), the fever condition is considered met.
- For neutropenia, if either criterion is met (ANC already low or anticipated to become low), the neutropenia condition is satisfied.

Febrile neutropenia is diagnosed when both a fever condition and a neutropenia condition are present. The diagnostic tool then provides the outcome:

- If both a fever condition and a neutropenia condition are present simultaneously, the patient meets the criteria for febrile neutropenia.
- If one or neither condition is met, the diagnostic criteria are not satisfied.

The diagnostic assessment outlined through user inputs ensures a straightforward determination of whether the criteria for febrile neutropenia are fulfilled. Here's a simplified overview of the possible outcomes:

| **Fever condition** | **Neutropenia condition** | **Result** |
|-|-|-|
| Fever ≥ 38.3°C (101°F) or sustained ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F) for 1 hour | Neutrophil count ≤ 500/mcL or expected to decrease to < 500/mcL | Meets criteria for febrile neutropenia |
| Any other situation | Any other situation | Diagnostic criteria not met |

This tool systematically assesses input parameters to help healthcare providers determine the presence of a potential febrile neutropenia case based on standard diagnostic measures.

### Rates of severe neutropenia and infection risk in patients treated with deferiprone: 28 years of data [^96d44ba0]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute, unforeseeable, and transient declines in absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) can occur with the use of some medications, a condition referred to here as idiosyncratic drug–induced neutropenias (IDINs). Although rare, IDIN may put patients at a high risk of serious and sometimes fatal infections, in particular if IDIN is profound and long lasting. For example, it is estimated that as many as 60% of patients with severe IDIN develop septicemia if their infections are not treated aggresively. Because patients experiencing IDINs can progress rapidly from having no symptoms or fever to developing sepsis, early detection of IDINs and timely measures to increase ANCs are critical to prevent serious infections.

Although the clinical characterization of neutropenias into strata of mild (ANC, 1 × 10 9 /L to 1.5 × 10 9 /L), moderate (ANC, 0.5 × 10⁹/L to 1 × 10 9 /L), and severe (ANC, < 0.5 × 10 9 /L) helps in predicting the risk of infections in patients with any type of neutropenia, there is a need to further characterize the risk of infections in patients with severe neutropenia with very low ANCs (ie, < 0.5×10⁹/L) to establish algorithms for rapid interventions adjusted to ANC levels and specific drugs.

### Factors associated with mortality in immunocompromised children with varicella [^4af89d88]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In this study, all patients who died had normal ANC with a low absolute lymphocyte count, resulting in a high NLR. Lymphocytes are a vital component of the immune system, categorized into T lymphocytes (T cells), B lymphocytes (B cells), and natural killer (NK) cells. T cells play a significant role in viral clearance, indicating that lymphopenia tends to delay viral clearance in favor of macrophage stimulation and the cytokine storm. This can affect the host's adaptive immune response, thereby impairing the body's ability to combat infections. Such impairment can increase the risk of developing opportunistic infections and unfavorable outcomes. The causes of lymphopenia in viral infections may involve mechanisms such as cell death, increased cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors; inhibition of lymphopoiesis; metabolic disturbances; and elevated glucocorticoid levels. NLR serves as a simple and easily calculable inflammatory biomarker derived from routine peripheral blood test results. It reflects the balance between neutrophils and lymphocytes in the bloodstream, providing insights into immune responses and inflammation. NLR may serve as informative biomarkers in patients with infection, indicating underlying immune (dys)function, particularly in peripheral blood. NLR demonstrated the potential clinical utility in several infectious diseases, such as pneumonia, pertussis, COVID-19, and urinary tract infection. The accessibility and affordability of these indices would render them especially beneficial for low- and middle-income countries. Our study showed the association between a high NLR ratio and the mortality in immunocompromised children with varicella. No research to date has established the NLR cutoff values that predict death in varicella patients; hence, additional rigorously designed studies are required to corroborate our findings.

### Relationship between white blood cell count and bacteremia using interval likelihood ratios in hospitalized patients [^21563dc0]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with bacteremia often have elevated white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts, yet these alone are poor predictors of bacteremia. Data on the continuous relationship between WBC response and bacteremia are lacking.

Objective

This study aims to characterize the relationship of WBC count, neutrophil percentage, and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) to bacteremia using interval likelihood ratios (ILRs) derived from a large sample of hospitalized patients.

Design

Retrospective cohort study in a large healthcare system from 2017 to 2018.

Patients

This study included non-surgical inpatients who had at least one complete blood count (CBC) with differential up to 24 hours after admission and a blood culture. Patients with immunosuppression and malignancy or who received antibiotics before negative blood cultures were excluded.

Main Measures

Predictors were WBC count, ANC, and neutrophil percentage. The outcome was bacteremia. We compared test discrimination using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC). We calculated ILRs for bacteremia across test value intervals. As a practical example, we assumed a 5% pre-test probability of bacteremia and calculated the post-test probability for each interval. We compared this approach to a threshold approach using a threshold of 70% neutrophils.

Results

Of 25,776 patients with a CBC with differential and blood culture, 1160 had bacteremia. AUROC was highest for neutrophil percentage (0.74), followed by ANC (0.63) and WBC count (0.58). Probability of bacteremia increased exponentially from neutrophil percentage 80 to 100%. Odds of bacteremia varied 35-fold based on neutrophil percentage. A threshold approach with a cut-off of 70% significantly underestimated bacteremia risk at higher levels.

Conclusions

ILRs offered a more discriminating approach to estimating the probability of bacteremia than a single threshold. Physicians assessing risk of bacteremia should pay attention to the magnitude of abnormality because very high and very low values have much stronger predictive power than dichotomized results.

### Absolute neutrophil count by duffy status among healthy black and African American adults [^65ce977d]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points

- The median ANC among Duffy-null individuals is significantly lower than that among Duffy non-null individuals.
- Nearly a quarter (23.8%) of Duffy-null individuals had an ANC lower than the reference range (< 2000 cells/μL) which likely causes iatrogenic harm.

Regarding specific circumstances for cellulitis, more specifically with respect to patients with febrile neutropenia (evaluation), IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend to obtain risk stratification in patients with fever and neutropenia according to susceptibility to infection:

- **High-risk**: anticipated prolonged and profound neutropenia with an absolute neutrophil count < 100 cells/mcL or with a MASCC score of < 21

- **Low-risk**: anticipated brief periods of neutropenia and few comorbidities

Skin and soft tissue infections in cancer patients with neutropenia — assessment recommendations emphasize episode classification, tissue diagnosis, risk stratification, and extent-of-infection workup. Determine whether the current presentation of fever and neutropenia is the patient's initial episode, persistent unexplained fever after 4–7 days, or a subsequent recurrent episode (strong, low). Aggressively determine the etiology by aspiration and/or biopsy of lesions and submit material for thorough cytological/histological assessments. Risk-stratify patients: high-risk are those with anticipated prolonged (> 7 days) and profound neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] < 100 cells/μL) or a Multinational Association for Supportive Care (MASCC) score of < 21; low-risk are those with anticipated brief (< 7 days) neutropenia and few comorbidities (strong, low) or a MASCC score of ≥ 21 (strong, moderate). Determine the extent of infection via thorough physical examination, blood cultures, chest radiograph, and additional imaging (including chest CT) as indicated by clinical signs and symptoms (strong, low).

### Clozapine (Clozaril) [^95d0702d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Severe Neutropenia

CLOZARIL has caused severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 500/μL) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)] and is associated with an increased risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Severe neutropenia occurred in a small percentage of CLOZARIL-treated patients. The risk of severe neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks of CLOZARIL treatment. The mechanism by which CLOZARIL causes neutropenia is unknown. Neutropenia is not dose dependent.

Consider a hematology consultation before initiating CLOZARIL treatment or during treatment.

ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modifications

Prior to initiating CLOZARIL treatment, obtain a baseline ANC. CLOZARIL initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/μL. Throughout CLOZARIL treatment, regularly monitor ANC. Table 1 provides recommendations for dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC levels, during CLOZARIL treatment and frequency of ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modification in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia

Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) generally have lower baseline neutrophil counts but they are not at higher risk for developing infections, and they are not at increased risk for developing CLOZARIL-induced neutropenia.

### White blood cells as a novel mortality predictor in haemodialysis patients [^2f3d41b1]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Many conventional cardiovascular risk factors in the general population are not as predictive in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). As absolute neutrophil count and total white blood cell (WBC) count are associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality, this analysis was undertaken to explore the associations of WBC variables with mortality risk in ESRD.

Methods

Of a total study population of 44 114 ESRD patients receiving haemodialysis during 1998 at facilities operated by Fresenius Medical Care, North America, 25 661 patients who underwent differential white cell count and had complete follow-up were included. Information on case mix (age, gender, race), clinical (diabetes, body mass index), and laboratory variables (haematocrit, albumin, creatinine, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, bicarbonate, ferritin, transferrin saturation and differential WBC count) was obtained. Associations between lymphocyte count, neutrophil count and demographic and clinical variables were examined using linear regression. Associations between WBC variables and survival were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression.

Results

A higher lymphocyte count was associated with higher serum albumin and creatinine, lower age and black race. High neutrophil count was associated with lower serum albumin and creatinine, younger age and white race (all Ps < 0.0001). Cox proportional hazard regression showed an increased lymphocyte count was associated with reduced mortality risk [HR 0.86 (0.83–0.89) per 500/ml increase in lymphocyte count] and an increased neutrophil count was associated with increased mortality risk [HR 1.08 (1.06–1.09) per 1000/ml increase in neutrophil count].

Conclusions

An increased neutrophil count is strongly associated with, and reduced lymphocyte count associated less strongly with, many surrogates of both malnutrition and inflammation. An increased neutrophil count and reduced lymphocyte count are independent predictors of increased mortality risk in haemodialysis patients.

### Increased platelet counts are associated with female sex and asthma severity [^a5942c5c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Significant sex differences occur in asthma phenotypes across the lifespan. Platelet activation is associated with a steroid-refractory asthma phenotype.

Objective

We sought to test the hypothesis that higher platelet counts in females are associated with increased prevalence and severity of asthma compared with males.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from participants' baseline visit in the UK Biobank. Binomial multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for age, body mass index, sex, race, smoking status, serum C-reactive protein, absolute eosinophil count, and absolute neutrophil count.

Results

Of the 351,203 patients included in the analysis, 5.7% had asthma, 2% met the British Thoracic Society criteria for moderate to severe asthma, and 57.4% were female. Female sex was associated with higher platelet counts among participants with or without asthma (P < .001). Median platelet counts were higher by 30 × 10³/μL in females with asthma when compared with males with asthma (median [interquartile range], 271.1 [235.0–312.0] vs 241.0 [209.0–279.4] × 10³/μL, P < .001, respectively). Among participants with asthma, higher platelet counts were also associated with increased asthma severity (P < .001). Platelet counts correlated positively with the blood absolute eosinophil count (r = 0.104, P < .001), blood neutrophil count (r = 0.254, P < .001), and C-reactive protein (r = 0.183, P < .001).

Conclusions

These findings suggest that platelet counts are associated with asthma and inflammation in both sexes and can serve as a potential biomarker for asthma severity with differential effects across the sexes. Future studies including mechanistic studies should characterize the interaction between sex hormones, platelet activation, and asthma severity.

Individuals, typically of African or Middle Eastern ancestry, may present with an absolute neutrophil count < 1, 500 cells per μL with no signs of recurrent infections, immunocompromise, or malignancy. Frequently, the lower ANC is a normal variant associated with the red blood cell Duffy-null phenotype that should be confirmed by blood bank phenotyping. Asymptomatic Duffy-null individuals do not require additional testing and should not be denied clinical trial participation or prescription of certain medications based on ANC alone.

### Detailed analysis of sputum and systemic inflammation in asthma phenotypes: are paucigranulocytic asthmatics really non-inflammatory? [^c2a373dc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Blood leukocyte counts and systemic inflammatory markers

The blood leukocyte counts and systemic inflammatory markers of asthma phenotypes and healthy subjects are shown in Table 3. All subgroups of asthmatics showed an increased level of blood leukocytes compared with healthy subjects (Table 3 and Fig. 2a). As expected, eosinophilic and mixed granulocytic asthmatics had higher blood eosinophils (in absolute values and percentages) than neutrophilic, paucigranulocytic asthma and healthy subjects, but paucigranulocytic asthmatics also showed higher levels of absolute blood eosinophils than healthy subjects. Neutrophilic asthmatics had the highest level of blood neutrophils, compared to eosinophilic, paucigranulocytic asthma and healthy subjects, but both eosinophilic and paucigranulocytic asthmatics also had greater absolute blood neutrophils than healthy subjects. Absolute lymphocyte counts were mainly increased in eosinophilic and paucigranulocytic asthma. Only the group of eosinophilic asthma had increased absolute blood basophil counts compared to healthy subjects. Neutrophilic asthma was characterized by raised CRP and fibrinogen levels, while eosinophilic asthma had raised fibrinogen only, compared with healthy subjects (Table 3 and Fig. 2b).

### Neutrophil count for the identification of postmenopausal hypertensive women at increased cardiovascular risk [^8081f36b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

High white blood cell and neutrophil counts identify patients at increased cardiovascular risk in various clinical settings. However, the prognostic value of white blood cell and neutrophil counts in hypertensive postmenopausal women is unknown. We tested the independent prognostic value of total white blood cell and neutrophil counts for cardiovascular events in hypertensive postmenopausal women.

Methods

We examined 298 initially untreated postmenopausal women with essential hypertension who were part of Progetto Ipertensione Umbria Monitoraggio Ambulatoriale (PIUMA). Mean duration of follow-up was 8 years (range 1–20 years). Treatment was tailored to each individual.

Results

Mean age at entry was 59 years. Diabetic women comprised 9.1% of the group, and current smokers comprised 17.5% of the group. During follow-up, 31 new major cardiovascular events occurred. In univariable analyses, age, diabetes, serum creatinine, blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy, and neutrophil count showed an association with the risk of events (all P < .05). In a multivariable Cox analysis, after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, for each 1.25x10 (1 standard deviation) increase in neutrophil count there was a 67% higher risk of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio 1.67, 95% confidence interval 1.32–2.07; P < .001). Furthermore, neutrophil count showed robust incremental predictive value for cardiovascular events, in addition to traditional risk factors. Total white blood cell count did not show any association with cardiovascular events.

Conclusion

A high peripheral neutrophil count identifies postmenopausal hypertensive women at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Such relation appears to be independent of traditional risk factors.

### Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and cancer prognosis: an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies [^3fd6ee8b]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Credibility ceilings were utilised for sensitivity analysis and to test the robustness of meta-analyses, considering studies of biomarkers often underestimate biases due to large sample sizes and observational study design. Credibility ceiling calculations inflate the variance of each study included in a meta-analysis to account for the probability c that the true effect size is in the opposite direction of effect of the observed point estimate. Inflated variances were calculated in Stata 14. The summary effect size and heterogeneity of each meta-analysis was assessed with ceiling values ranging from 5 to 20%.

Associations between neutrophil counts (here NLR or TAN) and cancer prognosis were categorised into strong, highly suggestive, suggestive, weak or uncertain through assessment of the strength and validity of the evidence for each meta-analysis, according to pre-defined Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) criteria outlined in Additional File 2: Supplementary Fig. 1. In order for an association to be considered strong, the meta-analysis must yield a P value of less than 10⁻⁶ in the random effects model, include more than 1000 individuals, show significance at P < 0.05 in the largest included study, find no heterogeneity (P > 0.10) through the Q test, detect less than 50% variance due to heterogeneity through the I² statistic, yield a prediction interval excluding the null value (HR = 1), display no evidence of small study effects or excess significance, and the association must maintain significance at P < 0.05 with the application of a credibility ceiling of 10%. The number of studies in each meta-analysis was also included as eligibility criterion for strong evidence since a sample size greater than three is required for reliable assessment of heterogeneity and small study effects. Associations categorised as "highly suggestive" were eligible to be upgraded to "strong" if they presented a HR > 2 and a lower 95% CI > 1.6. To assess the potential impact of limitations around the measures assessing heterogeneity on the GRADE criteria, we performed a sensitivity analysis in which I² and Cochran's Q test criteria were removed for associations classified as strong. Additionally, we applied a simplified method to rank associations based only on their effect size estimate (HR) and precision (standard error from PI or CI intervals) to aid interpretation.

|-|-|
|Morphologic leukemia-free state|- Leukemic blasts < 5% and no measurable extramedullary leukemia < br > - Absolute neutrophil count < 500/microL and platelets < 50/microL < br > - The marrow shows ≥ 10% cellularity, with at least 200 cells enumerated from an aspirate that contains spicules|
|Aplastic marrow|- All criteria for morphologic leukemia-free state are met, but with < 10% cellularity and/or an aspicular aspirate with < 200 cells that can be enumerated|
|Refractory disease|- Complete remission not achieved at the end of induction|
|Progressive disease|- Appearance of circulating leukemic blasts or an increase of at least 25% in the absolute number of circulating or bone marrow blasts or development of extramedullary disease|
|Relapsed disease|- Reappearance of blasts in the blood or bone marrow (> 5%) or in any extramedullary site after a complete remission (category 2A).|

### Disorders of neutrophil number and function [^94b6d4f0]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2006). Low credibility.

This review of disorders of neutrophil number and function will discuss important research advances in the field and then provide a clinical diagnostic approach. The focus will be on two recent clinical developments in the field of phagocyte disorders. First, an important natural history study from the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry has recently quantitated the incidence and risk factors for death from sepsis and for progression to myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia in a large cohort of severe chronic neutropenia patients, many of whom were followed 10 or more years on treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Second, in the past year, a multinational group has announced successful gene therapy of two adults with chronic granulomatous disease, the most common disorder of neutrophil function. However, monitoring of retroviral insertion sites revealed expansion of the multiclonal population of gene-modified cells, raising concerns about eventual leukemogenesis. The review also provides a pragmatic approach to the evaluation of a patient with a suspected disorder of neutrophil number or function.

Results

Stability over time

Based on the 95% confidence interval of the ICC estimate, the reliability of NLR values over time was good (ICC = .592, CI = .502–.682, p < .001; R-squared = .351). Furthermore, an analysis of the percent change in NLR between readings and the time between those measurements found that an increased duration between readings was not significantly correlated with increased variability (Pearson Correlation Coefficient: −.111, 95%CI: −.245–.028, p = .117). Based on the 95% confidence interval of the ICC estimate, the reliability of LNR values over time was excellent (ICC = .761, CI = .702–.819, p < .001; R-squared = .601). Graphs of NLR and LNR, as well as absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, measured at two different time points can be seen in Fig. 1.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^660f4dce]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV-associated bacterial pneumonia — prophylaxis and risk reduction emphasizes that use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for PCP prophylaxis is associated with decreased risk, with daily TMP-SMX prophylaxis reducing bacterial respiratory infections; however, indiscriminate TMP-SMX use may promote resistance, and in the United States "TMP-SMX should not be prescribed solely to prevent bacterial respiratory infection (AIII)" and "clarithromycin or azithromycin should not be prescribed solely for preventing bacterial respiratory infection (AIII)". A decreased absolute neutrophil count (e.g., < 500 cells/mm3) is associated with increased risk of bacterial infections including pneumonia; to reduce risk, clinicians "should take steps to reverse neutropenia, such as by stopping myelosuppressive drugs (CIII)", and studies of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) "have failed to document benefit". Modifiable risk factors include "smoking cigarettes, using injection drugs, and consuming alcohol"; clinicians "should encourage cessation", refer to services, and/or prescribe medications, and "smoking cessation can decrease the risk of bacterial pneumonia".

### Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio predicts the outcome of acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^dc4259a2]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Increasing evidence suggests that inflammatory mechanisms are involved in the intracerebral hemorrhage-induced brain injury. We evaluated the prognostic role of the peripheral leukocyte counts and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.

Methods

Patients with acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage were retrospectively identified. Total white blood cells, absolute neutrophil count, and absolute lymphocyte count were obtained and the NLR computed from the admission blood work. The study end point was the occurrence of death or major disability at 3 months.

Results

One hundred seventy-seven subjects were enrolled. Ninety-four (53.1%) had unfavorable outcome. The absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, and NLR were independently associated with the 3-month status. The NLR resulted the best discriminating variable and the best predictive cut-off value was 4.58.

Conclusions

In patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage, higher neutrophils, lower lymphocytes, and higher NLRs predicted worse 3-month outcome.

### Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as a prognostic indicator of mortality in polycythemia vera: insights from a prospective cohort analysis [^88203e41]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

NLR and mortality

(i) A total of 151 deaths (10%) were recorded for an overall mortality rate of 3.7 deaths per 100 persons per year. The incidence rates of CV and non-CV mortality were 1.7 and 1.8 deaths per 100 persons per year, respectively. CV mortality accounted for 45% of all deaths, while hematologic transformation and solid tumors were the cause of death in 13% and 19.5% of fatal cases, respectively. To evaluate how the NLR and individual neutrophil and lymphocyte counts impacted the risk of death, we used generalized additive proportional hazards models (GAMs) (Fig. 1). In Panel A the curve shows that higher neutrophil counts were associated with an increased risk of death, as the hazard ratio rises with increasing neutrophil counts. Panel B shows an inverse relationship between lymphocyte counts and the risk of death; higher lymphocyte count was associated with a lower hazard ratio, indicating a lower risk of death. Panel C shows that an increasing NLR was associated with a higher hazard ratio, indicating that a higher NLR correlated with an increased risk of death. Fig. 1 Generalized additive models (GAMs) for the prediction of death. The figure reports GAMs by absolute neutrophils (A), lymphocytes (B) and their ratio NLR (C). The effect of neutrophils, lymphocytes and their ratio on the risk of death was analyzed on a continuous scale using a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) with a smooth function fitted by cubic splines. Hazard ratio estimates (solid line) along with their 95% confidence intervals (gray area) are plotted on a logarithmic scale.
(ii) We also examined whether NLR values compared with absolute numbers of individual neutrophil and lymphocyte counts had greater discriminatory power in predicting death, but found no significant difference. However, the NLR appeared a more robust and precise predictor of mortality risk, particularly at higher values, compared to absolute neutrophil or lymphocyte counts. This is evidenced by the narrower confidence intervals at higher NLR values (Fig. 1), indicating greater precision and reliability in predicting death.
(iii) Kaplan-Meier curve (Fig. 2) illustrates the overall survival of patients stratified by their NLR values. Patients with a higher NLR (≥ 5) had a significantly lower overall survival compared to those with a lower NLR (< 5) (p < 0.001); the rate of deaths was more than double in patients with higher NLR levels (rate % patient-years: 5.93, 95% CI 4.73–7.44 versus 2.76, 95% CI 2.20–3.45, respectively). Fig. 2 Kaplan-Meier survival curve by baseline NLR values. Kaplan-Meier curve illustrates the overall survival of patients stratified by their Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) values. Patients with a higher NLR had a significantly lower overall survival compared to those with a lower NLR (p < 0.001); the rate of deaths was more than double in patients with higher NLR levels.

### Absolute neutrophil count nadir in healthy pediatric patients with the duffy-null phenotype [^8a139bae]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

This study had some notable limitations. Duffy antigen typing is not a routinely obtained test. Many of the patients who had Duffy phenotype with Fy(a-b-) were given a referral to Michigan Medicine for the evaluation of neutropenia, resulting in ascertainment bias. Patients with the lowest ANC values were additionally more likely to undergo repeat ANC testing, which almost certainly skews the data toward the lower end of the possible healthy values for patients with Fy(a-b-). Follow-up to determine the risk of infection or alternative causes of low ANC was based on a retrospective chart review and limited to the patients' contact with Michigan Medicine (range of single encounter to 7.0 years between the first and last ANC). Furthermore, we assumed that our control patients are Duffy non-null based on their listed ethnicity, but Duffy antigen typing was not clinically indicated and therefore not completed. Reassuringly, the ANCs from the control patients were within the normal ranges during this study.

This study elucidates that healthy children with Fy(a-b-) may have a very low ANC without a clearly increased risk of infection. An ANC > 500 cells per μL in children is likely to be consistent with DANC in an appropriate clinical context. Furthermore, healthy children with the Fy(a-b-) variant may have a limited duration of ANC < 500 cells per μL without any other apparent pathology. Although very low ANC is alarming for providers, the full context of the child must be considered. We strongly encourage providers who are presented with a child with a low ANC and no concerning history or physical findings to obtain Duffy antigen typing as an initial step in evaluation, particularly if the child is of any African or Middle Eastern ancestry. It is important to note that the Fy(a-b-) phenotype is supportive of DANC but cannot rule out other pathologies, and > 1 pathology may exist simultaneously. However, we believe that identifying this phenotype in the correct clinical context could avoid unnecessary and costly workup. The next steps for clinical laboratories include the development of new Fy(a-b-) pediatric ANC reference ranges based on age, which is essential for understanding the expected range of normal for this common variant. Establishing normal ANC ranges for individuals with Fy(a-b-) will not only offer the opportunity for more equitable care by accurately reflecting states of health for these patients but also potentially help avoid unnecessary testing and referrals.

### Hairy cell leukemia, version 2.2018, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^ce6223c3]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2017). Medium credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2026 — Hairy Cell Leukemia infection prophylaxis and neutropenia management — Anti-infective prophylaxis for a minimum of 3 months and until CD4+ T-cell count is ≥ 200 cells/mm3 is recommended for all patients requiring treatment, and broad-spectrum antibacterial prophylaxis should be considered for patients with neutropenia. Available evidence suggests that the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) shortens the duration of severe neutropenia after treatment with cladribine; however, it has no clinically significant impact on infection-related outcomes, and the use of G-CSFs either as primary prophylaxis or based on the absolute neutrophil count have been shown to be effective for the management of neutropenia. The use of G-CSF might be considered in patients with severe neutropenic fever following chemotherapy.

### Detailed analysis of sputum and systemic inflammation in asthma phenotypes: are paucigranulocytic asthmatics really non-inflammatory? [^527dba97]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The technique of induced sputum has allowed to subdivide asthma patients into inflammatory phenotypes according to their level of granulocyte airway infiltration. There are very few studies which looked at detailed sputum and blood cell counts in a large cohort of asthmatics divided into inflammatory phenotypes. The purpose of this study was to analyze sputum cell counts, blood leukocytes and systemic inflammatory markers in these phenotypes, and investigate how those groups compared with healthy subjects.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study on 833 asthmatics recruited from the University Asthma Clinic of Liege and compared them with 194 healthy subjects. Asthmatics were classified into inflammatory phenotypes.

Results

The total non-squamous cell count per gram of sputum was greater in mixed granulocytic and neutrophilic phenotypes as compared to eosinophilic, paucigranulocytic asthma and healthy subjects (p < 0.005). Sputum eosinophils (in absolute values and percentages) were increased in all asthma phenotypes including paucigranulocytic asthma, compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005). Eosinophilic asthma showed higher absolute sputum neutrophil and lymphocyte counts than healthy subjects (p < 0.005), while neutrophilic asthmatics had a particularly low number of sputum macrophages and epithelial cells. All asthma phenotypes showed an increased blood leukocyte count compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005), with paucigranulocytic asthmatics having also increased absolute blood eosinophils compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005). Neutrophilic asthma had raised CRP and fibrinogen while eosinophilic asthma only showed raised fibrinogen compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005).

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that a significant eosinophilic inflammation is present across all categories of asthma, and that paucigranulocytic asthma may be seen as a low grade inflammatory disease.

### Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and cancer prognosis: an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies [^d6b3e741]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In order to determine the impact of study size on the magnitude of the summary effect size, random effects estimates were plotted against the inverse variance of the pooled effect size from each meta-analysis. When compared to meta-analyses with large variances, those with smaller variances produced more conservative estimates, displaying a smaller range of HR estimates and a slight tendency toward a null value (HR = 1). Meta-analyses with large variance displayed a wide range of random effects HR and included an increased number of HR estimates greater than two (Fig. 2 b).

Reproducibility

In 87 of the 204 included meta-analyses (43%), the pooled effect size was reproduced with an absolute difference between the calculated and reported HR outside of the range which can be attributed to rounding errors (> 0.01). Twenty-eight of these 87 meta-analyses were within 2% of the reported HR, 35 were between 2% and 5% of the reported HR, 14 were between 5% and 10% and ten meta-analyses reported an HR with over a 10% difference from the calculated HR (Additional File 1: Appendix D).

Heterogeneity between studies

Prediction intervals were not calculated for 25 (12%) meta-analyses which had included only two individual studies (Additional File 3: Supplementary Table 1). The prediction intervals of 131 meta-analyses (64%) included the null value of HR = 1. Of 179 meta-analyses (87%) including at least three individual studies, 47 had prediction intervals which excluded the null value (HR = 1). The 25 meta-analyses (12%) including exactly three individual studies yielded very wide prediction intervals, all of which included the null value of HR = 1. For completeness, we also calculated I² values and Cochran's Q test although they must be interpreted with caution due to low power, consistent direction of effect and moderate magnitude of effects (Additional File 1: Appendix E).

### Differences in neutrophil counts between African and non-African countries in 2 international clinical trials [^b6e97202]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Differences in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) between African and non-African populations have been reported. Neutropenia has also been reported during rifamycin use. ANC values in current tables that assign severity grades to clinical or laboratory events (The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Division of AIDS [DAIDS]) might not consistently be applicable among different populations.

Methods

During two international tuberculosis treatment trials, 337 participants received rifampin, and three groups of 361, 81, and 81 participants received 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg of rifapentine, respectively, for two months of daily treatment. ANC was measured at baseline, and after 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. CTCAE versions 2.0–4.0 and DAIDS version 2.0 define neutropenia grade 3 as ANC 500–999/mm3 and ANC 400–599/mm3, respectively. We analyzed factors associated with neutropenia.

Results

Baseline median ANC was lower in Black African participants than in Black non-African participants (p = 0.004). CTCAE-defined ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia occurred in 32 (28 in Africa) participants. Proportions did not differ between rifapentine doses. Only 4 events would have been reported by DAIDS criteria. All neutropenia events resolved spontaneously without interrupting treatment. Enrollment in an African country was an independent factor associated with the development of neutropenia.

Discussion

Differences in baseline median ANC can result in misclassification of adverse events or inappropriate clinical management. Development and use of population-specific normal values of ANC could improve guidance for research and clinical management.

### Blood and sputum eosinophils in COPD; relationship with bacterial load [^ea904d4d]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

We observed evidence of an inverse relationship between bacterial infection and eosinophil counts in COPD. Firstly, sputum eosinophil counts were lower in COPD patients with bacterial infection in the stable state. Secondly, COPD patients with bacterial infection during exacerbations had a significant decrease in the blood eosinophil absolute count compared to the stable state, while no blood eosinophil count changes were observed in patients without bacterial infection. These observations during the stable state and exacerbations showing an inverse relationship between bacterial infection and eosinophil counts may be relevant to corticosteroid responsiveness in COPD; the increased corticosteroid responsiveness observed with higher eosinophil counts could be due, at least partly, to lower levels of bacterial infection.

This inverse relationship between bacterial counts and blood eosinophils was present during exacerbations but not in the stable state. This is likely to be due to the stronger association between blood and sputum eosinophils at exacerbation compared to the stable state. Blood eosinophils have been proposed as a surrogate biomarker of sputum eosinophils, but the weak relationship between these measurements in the stable state, demonstrated here and in previous studies, highlights a limitation of blood eosinophil counts in this context.

The prevalence of bacterial colonisation at baseline in our study (52%) was comparable to previously published studies that used qPCR to detect PPM presence; Bafadhel et al. reported a 51% prevalence while, Barker et al. reported a 77% prevalence. In the stable state, higher bacterial counts were associated with higher sputum neutrophil % and lower eosinophil %. This relationship between higher sputum bacterial counts and increased sputum neutrophil % is known. The lower sputum eosinophil % in COPD patients with bacterial colonisation is partly due to the bacterial driven increase in absolute and percentage neutrophil counts causing a lower calculated eosinophil %. However, the absolute sputum eosinophil count is not dependent on any calculation involving the neutrophil count, and we observed that the absolute sputum eosinophil count was also lower in patients with sputum eosinophils < 3%, indicating a genuine reduction in eosinophil numbers in the airways of patients with higher bacterial counts.

### Understanding chronic neutropenia: life is short [^267b23fc]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying chronic neutropenia are extensive, varying from haematopoietic stem cell disorders resulting in defective neutrophil production, to accelerated apoptosis of neutrophil progenitors or circulating mature neutrophils. While the knowledge concerning genetic defects associated with congenital neutropenia or bone marrow failure is increasing rapidly, the functional role and consequences of these genetic alterations is often not well understood. In addition, there is a large group of diseases, including primary immunodeficiencies and metabolic diseases, in which chronic neutropenia is one of the symptoms, while there is no clear bone marrow pathology or haematopoietic stem cell dysfunction. Altogether, these disease entities illustrate the complexity of normal neutrophil development, the functional role of the (bone marrow) microenvironment and the increased propensity to undergo apoptosis, which is typical for neutrophils. The large variety of disorders associated with chronic neutropenia makes classification almost impossible and possibly not desirable, based on the clinical phenotypes. However, a better understanding of the regulation of normal myeloid differentiation and neutrophil development is of great importance in the diagnostic evaluation of unexplained chronic neutropenia. In this review we propose insights in the pathophysiology of chronic neutropenia in the context of the functional role of key players during normal neutrophil development, neutrophil release and neutrophil survival.

### Tocilizumab (tocilizumab-anoh) [^8649e910]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1	General Considerations for Administration

Not Recommended for Concomitant Use with Biological DMARDs

Tocilizumab products have not been studied in combination with biological DMARDs such as TNF antagonists, IL-1R antagonists, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies and selective co-stimulation modulators because of the possibility of increased immunosuppression and increased risk of infection. Avoid using Tocilizumab-anoh with biological DMARDs.

Baseline Laboratory Evaluation Prior to Treatment

Obtain and assess baseline complete blood count (CBC) and liver function tests prior to treatment.

RA, GCA, PJIA and SJIA – It is recommended that Tocilizumab-anoh not be initiated in patients with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) below 2000 per mm3, platelet count below 100,000 per mm3, or ALT or AST above 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4)].
CRS - Patients with severe or life-threatening CRS frequently have cytopenias or elevated ALT or AST due to the lymphodepleting chemotherapy or the CRS. The decision to administer Tocilizumab-anoh should take in to account the potential benefit of treating the CRS versus the risks of short-term treatment with Tocilizumab-anoh.
COVID-19 – It is recommended that Tocilizumab-anoh not be initiated in patients with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) below 1000 per mm3, platelet count below 50,000 mm3, or ALT or AST above 10 times ULN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4)].

### The relationship between the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and diabetic retinopathy in adults from the United States: results from the national health and nutrition examination survey [^c87b61fc]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus (DM). Systemic inflammation is intimately associated with DR. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) index is a relatively new indicator of inflammation.

Methods

This cross-sectional study was carried out among adults with DM based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2009 to 2016. NLR was presented as absolute neutrophil counts/ absolute lymphocyte counts. The relationship of NLR levels to DR was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression.

Results

There were 2772 eligible subjects extracted from the NHANES. In the multivariate analysis, NLR was related to the risk of DR after adjustment for potential confounders. The association between NLR levels and DR was nonlinear, with an inflection point of 4.778. Compared with the baseline values, NLR was not statistically significant on the right side of the inflection point (1.000, 0.914 to 1.094, 0.9974) but was positively associated with DR on the left side (1.236, 1.132 to 1.349, < 0.0001).

Conclusions

NLR reflects systemic inflammation that may increase the risk of DR. NLR positively correlates with DR when its value is less than 4.778.

### Detailed analysis of sputum and systemic inflammation in asthma phenotypes: are paucigranulocytic asthmatics really non-inflammatory? [^a7a01423]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Sputum cell counts and viability

The sputum cell counts and viability of asthma phenotypes and healthy subjects are shown in Table 2. The total non-squamous cell count per gram of sputum and the cell viability were greater in mixed granulocytic and neutrophilic phenotypes compared to eosinophilic, paucigranulocytic asthma and healthy subjects. Eosinophilic asthmatics also had significantly greater total sputum cell counts than paucigranulocytic asthmatics and healthy subjects. The fraction of squamous cells was less than 20% in a majority of the patients, and was particularly low in eosinophilic, neutrophilic and mixed granulocytic asthma. While levels were obviously the highest in eosinophilic and mixed granulocytic phenotypes compared to other asthmatics, sputum eosinophils (in absolute values and percentages) were increased in all asthma phenotypes, compared to healthy subjects (Table 2 and Fig. 1a). Absolute neutrophil counts were increased not only in neutrophilic and mixed granulocytic asthma, but also in eosinophilic asthma subjects, compared with healthy subjects. The group of neutrophilic asthma was the only one to have a lower absolute sputum macrophage count than eosinophilic, paucigranulocytic asthmatics and healthy subjects. Absolute sputum lymphocyte count was greater in eosinophilic asthma (p < 0.005, versus paucigranulocytic asthma and healthy subjects), while absolute epithelial cell count was remarkably lower in case of intense neutrophilic inflammation (p < 0.005, versus paucigranulocytic and eosinophilic asthma, Table 2 and Fig. 1b).

### Thrombosis in myeloproliferative neoplasms: a viewpoint on its impact on myelofibrosis, mortality, and solid tumors [^950ec935]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

After myocardial infarction, leukocytosis predicts the risk of re-infarction and death, indicating that the superimposed inflammation on a pre-existing lesion may increase the plaque size and display high protease activity making it more vulnerable for thrombosis.

This triggers a vicious cycle of innate immunity, cross-activation of platelets and neutrophils, culminating in clot formation. The phenomenon of "immunothrombosis" is more evident in arteries after rupture or erosion of an atherosclerotic plaque with strong platelet involvement, which favors leukocyte recruitment and NET formation. In contrast, the thrombo-inflammatory profile in venous thrombosis induced by stasis of blood flow is different, with less intense platelet activation compared to arteries, given the integrity of the endothelial surface.

Several biochemical biomarkers are associated with the inflammatory state in MPNs and are prognostic risk for myelofibrosis evolution and mortality. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α, are shown to trigger the C-reactive protein (CRP) formation that is strikingly correlated with JAK2 V617F mutation allele burden. Elevated CRP levels were associated with mortality in MF and major thrombotic events in patients with ET and PV. More recently, new hematologic biomarkers routinely measured in common blood tests have been the subject of several investigations, including absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Elevated NLR values are considered as expression of hyper-proliferative state of the innate myeloid immune system and dysregulation of the adaptive immune system. Importantly, the increasing NLR values were associated with thrombosis, evolution of myelofibrosis, and high mortality rate in ET, PV and MF. These notions have been deeply investigated in PV (Fig. 2). In a prospective cohort of 1508 PV patients enrolled in the ECLAP study, the relationship between the continuous variables of NLR, absolute lymphocyte and neutrophil counts were correlated with survival. There was a linear upward trend in the risk of death with increasing absolute neutrophil count and decreasing lymphocyte count, with log HRs greater than 0 (i.e. HR > 1) for neutrophil and lymphocyte counts greater than 8 × 10⁹/L and less than 2 × 10⁹/L, respectively. The NLR showed a similar trend of linear increase in risk as the neutrophil count, but with more precise 95% confidence intervals, especially for extreme values, reaching HR > 1 when NLR > 5 (unpublished data).

### Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia as a prognostic factor in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: results from Japan multinational trial organization LC00-03 [^cfa0243f]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

We have previously confirmed that increased pretreatment neutrophil count is an independent negative prognostic factor, and we included it as one of covariates in the present study. Tumour-related leukocytosis (neutrophilia) is encountered occasionally in patients with NSCLC and has recently been demonstrated to be an important negative prognostic factor for overall survival and time to progression in patients with NSCLC. Although autonomous production of G-CSF and granulocyte–macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) by tumour has been identified in some cases, leukocytosis (neutrophilia) in NSCLC patients is not fully understood and is likely to be caused by a combination of factors. Considering the negative prognostic value of leukocytosis (neutrophilia), it can be hypothesised that a proportion of the patients who do not develop neutropenia during treatment may have a poorer prognosis because they may be potentially affected by tumour-related leukocytosis (neutrophilia) and protected from chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. However, the results of our analysis suggest that chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is a predictor independent of NSCLC-related leukocytosis, since the risk of death estimated by the proportional-hazards regression model was significantly lower in patients who had grade-1 to 2 chemotherapy-induced neutropenia after adjustment for covariates, including pretreatment neutrophil count.

We estimated hazard ratios for the overall survival for subgroups assigned by the combination of the worst grade of neutropenia and the best tumour response. Patients who experienced neutropenia with PR as the best tumour response showed lower risk of death than those with PR who lacked neutropenia. The hazard ratios did not differ significantly between the patients who developed mild or severe neutropenia with SD and those with PR who lacked neutropenia. There are some limitations to the assessment of tumour size using the RECIST method or other widely used methods of assessing tumour response to anticancer therapy.reported the importance of how to interpret SD and introduced the concept of disease control rate. Results from the randomised trial (JMTO LC00-03) and this study add further evidence that the association between the RECIST response and overall survival may depend on the grade of neutropenia and that the RESICT response may not be a surrogate endpoint for overall survival of advanced NSCLC in the chemotherapy setting. Further investigation into this association in a large-scale meta-analysis would be helpful to resolve the important question of whether tumour response to anticancer agents could be used as a surrogate for overall survival in patients with advanced cancer.

### Increased neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio is a poor prognostic factor in patients with primary operable and inoperable pancreatic cancer [^90154616]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

In comparison with other tumour entities, the incidence of pancreatic cancer (PC) is low and has not changed a lot during the last two decades. Although continuous progress in tumour-specific therapy or outcome could be reached in the majority of malignant diseases, PC management still stays unsatisfying, as hardly any breakthrough in PC therapy has been obtained up to now. Therefore, unfortunately the mortality of PC is nearly 100% after 5-year follow-up. The high mortality is linked to local tumour progression and complications of distant metastases. Limited potential of curative resection as the only measurement of cure results from non-specific symptoms up to asymptomatic illness for a long time – and despite tremendous advances – still unsatisfying imaging technology. Thus, at the time of diagnosis most patients have to rely on palliative chemotherapy, whose efficacy is unsatisfying. Consequently, intense research has to be performed towing to the lack of tumour-specific regimes available and insufficient early tumour detection. Currently, the prediction of tumour progression or recurrence is limited to the use of histopathological and clinical factors, such as tumour size, histological grade, histological subtype or age at diagnosis. The identification of novel prognostic factors might enable a better risk stratification for adjuvant treatment modalities after surgery or more aggressive treatment in patients with primary metastatic disease. External validation of prognostic risk assessment tools in independent cohorts of patients is paramount before the generalisation of the applicability of a prognostic marker or model. Changes in the systemic inflammatory response to tumour cell manifestation or systemic inflammation at all can be easily measured by blood-based parameters such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein (CRP) or different levels of white blood cells, with, for example, a better outcome for a high density of lymphocytes in tumour stroma than a lower one. Importantly, especially the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been assumed to be an easily available and trustable marker to predict patients' survival in different types of cancer. In the last years, these findings have been proven within several tumour entities regarding its role in prediction of cancer progression and prognosis. In PC, controversial data exist regarding NLR and tumour outcome, but most of these studies included rather small numbers of investigated cases (n < 100) and differ in terms of inclusion criteria and clinical end points. Therefore, the aim of our study was to externally validate the value of NLR as a prognostic parameter in a large cohort of 371 PC patients. For this purpose, we tested the prognostic relevance of NLR with regard to cancer-specific survival (CSS), stratified for (A) patients who underwent surgical resection (group 1) and (B) patients who were inoperable at the time of diagnosis (group 2).

Automated blood analysers revealed a reduced absolute neutrophil count in the peripheral blood of the SCN1 patients

Peripheral blood counts were determined using Sysmex 800 or 2100, and data are presented as mean values for an average of > 30 blood samples per SCN1 patient collected in periods without G-CSF treatment (Table 2). The mean neutrophil numbers were reduced dramatically in all SCN1 patients as compared to the reference value (1.5–8.5 × 10⁹/L). Yet, the mean numbers of neutrophils in patient samples, as measured with automated blood analysers, were above 0.5 × 10⁹/L, suggesting a mild disease, which contrasted the clinical manifestations (Table 3). For example, and in agreement with a previous report, all patient samples had increased levels of the acute phase C-reactive protein (CRP), displayed increased mean thrombocyte counts (higher than the normal range), and also high monocyte and eosinophil counts (above or at the upper level of the normal range), indicating frequent infections/inflammation. Of note, the mean eosinophil counts did not exceed the mean neutrophil counts for any patient, except for P08 (Table 2). Also, automated blood analysis of the SCN4 patient revealed reduced neutrophil counts (mean 0.78 × 10⁹/L) but normal eosinophil counts (mean 0.06 × 10⁹/L; data not shown).

### Use of the complete blood cell count in early-onset neonatal sepsis [^d3152601]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Early-onset sepsis (EOS) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates, and its diagnosis remains challenging. The complete blood cell count and differential have been previously evaluated as diagnostic tools for EOS in small, single-center reports. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the complete blood cell count and differential in EOS in a large, multicenter population of neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit.

Methods

Using a cohort of 166,092 neonates with suspected EOS with cultures admitted to 293 neonatal intensive care units, we calculated odds ratios and receiver operating characteristic curves for complete blood cell count indices and prediction of a positive culture. We determined sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios for various commonly used cutoff values from the complete blood cell count.

Results

Low white blood cell counts, low absolute neutrophil counts and high immature-to-total neutrophil ratios were associated with increasing odds of infection (highest odds ratios: 5.38, 6.84 and 7.97, respectively). Specificity and negative predictive values were high (73.7%-99.9% and > 99.8%). However, sensitivities were low (0.3%-54.5%) for all complete blood cell count indices analyzed.

Conclusion

Low white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count and high immature-to-total neutrophil ratio were associated with increasing odds of infection, but no complete blood cell count-derived index possesses the sensitivity to rule out reliably EOS in neonates.

### Absolute neutrophil count in aseptic and bacterial meningitis related to time of lumbar puncture [^2ca2ca80]. Pediatric Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Previous studies have demonstrated that during the first 24 hours of illness caused by aseptic meningitis, polymorphonuclear cells predominate in cerebrospinal fluid and decline afterward. To test the hypothesis that the absolute neutrophil count and percentage of polymorphonuclear cells in cerebrospinal fluid of bacterial meningitis patients are elevated and sustained after 24 hours compared with that of patients with aseptic meningitis. Seventy-two patients with aseptic meningitis and 13 with bacterial meningitis participated. All patients with aseptic meningitis and four patients with bacterial meningitis were followed-up prospectively. The patients were enrolled in four groups according to the interval between onset of symptoms and performance of the lumbar puncture (< 12 hours, 12–24 hours, 24–36 hours, and > 36 hours). In aseptic meningitis the mean absolute neutrophil count was 182, 164, 79, and 68 cells/mm(3), respectively (P = 0.025). In bacterial meningitis the absolute neutrophil count was 28, 1,466, 5,853, and 235 cells/mm(3), respectively. The mean percentage of polymorphonuclear cells in aseptic meningitis was 49%, 46%, 40%, and 26%, respectively (P = 0.038); in bacterial meningitis, 70%, 83%, 81%, and 58%, respectively. The findings suggest that the absolute neutrophil count and the polymorphonuclear cell percentage in cerebrospinal fluid have different kinetics in aseptic vs. bacterial meningitis.

CBC should be monitored prior to and throughout each treatment cycle. Patients with neutropenia should be monitored for signs of infection and advised to report signs or symptoms of bleeding or bruising immediately, especially when using concomitant medication that may increase bleeding risk.

Recommendation 1: In patients with myelosuppression (neutropenia [absolute neutrophil count ≤ 1,000/μL for at least 7 days; absolute neutrophil count ≤ 1,000/μL associated with a body temperature ≥ 100.4°F (38 °C); or absolute neutrophil count < 500/ μL], or thrombocytopenia [platelet count ≤ 50,000/μL]), tafasitamab should be interrupted; dosing may restart at the same dose when neutrophil/platelet count has returned to an acceptable level (Table 3). If neutropenia recurs despite G-CSF prophylaxis or in case of thrombocytopenia, LEN should be interrupted and resumed with a stepwise 5 mg dose reduction.

Recommendation 2: Patients with prolonged neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count ≤ 500/μL for at least 7 days) or those at increased risk due to previous neutropenic complication or recurring episodes of neutropenic fever may receive antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal prophylaxis (Table 3).

### Chronic TNF in the aging microenvironment exacerbates tet2 loss-of-function myeloid expansion [^16118c22]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

TNF contributes to myeloid regeneration in chimeric mice after BMT

To gain insight into whether the microenvironment influenced the reconstitution potential of donor WT (CD45.1 +) and Tet2 –/– (CD45.2 +) cells, we assessed leukocytes in the periphery using flow cytometry, with a focus on the myeloid lineage. Gating myeloid cells by CD45 allele type revealed that Tet2 –/– cells had an advantage over WT cells in the circulation of all engrafted mice, shown by significant main effects for allele type. This Tet2 –/– myeloid bias was exacerbated by TNF in the aging microenvironment. Although overall monocyte cell counts were similar among recipient mice, a 2-way analysis of variance accounting for allele type revealed that the absolute cell count of Tet2 –/– monocytes was higher in old WT recipient mice than in young recipient mice after BMT (Figure 2 A; Table 1). In accordance with what was observed in the BM, the absolute cell count of Ly6C high monocytes was increased in old WT recipients, and this corresponded with a significant increase in Tet2 –/– cells (Figure 2 B). Although the old TNF – / – recipient mice had an increase in the number of Tet2 –/– Ly6C high monocytes, the effect was less pronounced, and total monocyte counts were comparable with that of young WT recipient mice (Figure 2 A-B). Absolute cell count data of neutrophils similarly demonstrated higher Tet2 –/– neutrophils in old WT but not old TNF – / – recipient mice (Figure 2 C), cumulating in an overall higher neutrophil count than young WT mice. Together, these data show that increased myelomonopoiesis within the BM coincides with increased numbers of Tet2 –/– monocytes and neutrophils in the blood.

### Blood neutrophil counts are associated with exacerbation frequency and mortality in COPD [^7cdbdc86]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Additional GLMs did not identify any important confounding effects (e-Figures 7 and 8). When looking at all exacerbations, the neutrophil effect remained significant in every case, with only the total number of exacerbations in the year up to index date attenuating the magnitude of the effect. (e-Figure 7). Restricting the analysis to the younger half of the cohort did not change the results (e-Figure 9). Changing the upper limit of the normal range from 6000 to 8000cells/μL halved the size of the elevated BNC group, and widened confidence intervals, without changing the overall results or conclusions (e-Figure 10).

The overall rate of change in FEV 1, across the whole cohort was − 0.038 (95%CI: − 0.034, − 0.041) L/yr or 38 mL/yr. The rate within the elevated BNC group was indistinguishable from the normal BNC group (Fig. 3 d). While estimated rate of decline for the elevated BNC group was slightly faster (difference − 0.004; 95%CI: − 0.010, 0.003), the difference was not statistically significant, and was reversed when consideration was restricted to only the first 3 years after the index date (difference between groups 0.002; 95%CI: − 0.012, 0.015). However, these confidence intervals are too wide to entirely rule out the existence of a clinically meaningful difference.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^0a8c9842]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Pooled data across early studies validate a significant correlation between elevated leukocyte count and decreased lymphocyte count among patients with severe cases of COVID-19 compared with those with mild cases. Why lymphopenia is associated with severe illness remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that this association could result from direct lymphocyte infection, destruction of lymphatic tissue, inflammation leading to lymphocyte apoptosis, or inhibition of lymphocytes by metabolic disorders such as lactic acidosis. Lymphopenia as a marker of severity does not seem to be specific to COVID-19; it has been used to prognosticate other viral pneumonias such as influenza. Neutrophilia may be more specific to severe disease than leukocytosis, but neutrophil count was not uniformly reported across the studies included in our analysis.

Despite our findings regarding clinical characteristics of severe COVID-19, our study had several limitations. First, our literature search found an expected paucity of data surrounding this topic because published characterizations of patients with COVID-19 remain minimal. More COVID-19 data from other nations and patient populations will aid in the comparison and validation of our clinical findings. Second, we noted significant heterogeneity in both the leukocyte and lymphocyte analyses. This phenomenon probably resulted from the small sample size, limited and early data, and skewed representation of the patient population. Third, the definitions of severe cases were somewhat inconsistent across these studies, varying from acute hypoxic respiratory failure to requiring mechanical ventilation. This variability could further compound the heterogeneity found across these studies. Last, only a minority of the manuscripts reported the proportion of patients with lymphopenia, and variable cutoffs based on the articles' reference ranges made it difficult to ascertain a cutoff for severe disease.

With the rising cases of COVID-19 and limited resources, being able to prioritize patients with severe disease is crucial. Some therapeutic agents are being investigated; however, supplies are often low and procurement may be delayed. The sooner patients with severe disease can be identified, the sooner the process of obtaining therapy can be initiated.

### Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^bc477a0b]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 — Acute lymphoblastic leukemia — response in bone marrow and peripheral blood: A complete remission (CR) requires the absence of circulating blasts and extramedullary disease with bone marrow showing trilineage hematopoiesis and < 5% blasts, plus absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1.0 × 10⁹/L, platelet count > 100 × 10⁹/L, and no recurrence for at least 4 weeks. A CR with incomplete recovery (CRi) is defined when CR criteria are met except ANC remains < 1.0 × 10⁹/L or platelet count remains < 100 × 10⁹/L, while CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) requires ANC ≥ 0.5 × 10⁹/L and platelet count ≥ 50 × 10⁹/L. Refractory disease is defined as having not achieved a CR at the end of induction therapy; progressive disease (PD) is an increase in circulating or bone marrow blasts by at least 25% or development of extramedullary disease; relapsed disease is the reappearance of blasts in blood or bone marrow (> 5%) or in any extramedullary site after CR.

### Allopurinol as a modifier of mercaptopurine metabolism in… [^a1f1712b]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

This pilot phase I trial studies how well allopurinol works in increasing the metabolism of mercaptopurine in younger patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma. A common side effect of treatments for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia lymphoblastic lymphoma, such as mercaptopurine, is increased absolute neutrophil counts. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cells that help the body fight infection. Allopurinol may increase the metabolism of mercaptopurine, creating a more active metabolic form that increases therapeutic response. Making mercaptopurine more effective could lower the doses required to treat younger patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and may safely decrease the absolute neutrophil count.

### Blood and sputum eosinophils in COPD; relationship with bacterial load [^d86c28d4]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

The inverse relationships between bacterial counts and sputum eosinophils provide a potential mechanism that determines corticosteroid responsiveness in COPD patients. Individuals with lower sputum eosinophil counts have higher levels of bacterial infection; perhaps the presence of more bacteria, with associated neutrophilic inflammation, contributes to the lower corticosteroid response previously reported. Neutrophilic airway inflammation appears to be poorly responsive to corticosteroid treatment, and the absence of bacterial inflammation may therefore favour a greater corticosteroid response through a shift in the balance of airway inflammation away from neutrophilic inflammation towards more eosinophilic inflammation.

Previous studies have failed to show a significant difference in sputum eosinophil % between stable COPD patients with bacteria present versus those without, although a numerical decrease in the former group was observed. Compatible with our results is the previous finding of a significantly lower level of sputum CCL13 (an eosinophil associated cytokine) in PPM positive COPD patients.

It has been reported that the effects of oral corticosteroids are dependent on the blood eosinophil count during COPD exacerbations, with more likelihood of treatment failure or a longer hospital stay with lower blood eosinophil counts. The data reported here show lower eosinophil counts during acute bacterial infections, and it could be inferred that treatment failure with oral corticosteroids in such cases is related to the presence of airway bacteria. During exacerbations both sputum and blood eosinophil measurements showed similar relationships to bacterial counts. However, the sputum data were less robust due to smaller sample size.

Blood neutrophil counts are known to increase during infection, irrespective of bacterial presence; we observed the same during COPD exacerbations. The decrease in blood eosinophil absolute count during exacerbation cannot be due to the increase in blood neutrophil counts for two reasons. First, there was a similar increase in blood neutrophil counts in both PPM positive and negative patients; second, we measured blood eosinophil absolute numbers which are not influenced by calculations of percentage relative to neutrophils.

### Length of stay and its associated factors in the neonatal intensive care unit of gadarif hospital, Eastern Sudan: a retrospective study [^6104ca08]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

In the present study, an increasing WBC count was associated with longer LOS. Other studies have obtained different results. Joachim et al. reported a positive association between increasing WBC counts and prolonged LOS, similar to our results, but Williams et al. found no association. Murphy and Weiner discovered that two normal immature-to-total neutrophil ratios and a negative blood culture at 24 h indicated the absence of early-onset sepsis. Duran et al. reported that neonatal leukemoid reactions in LBW infants were associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and maternal chorioamnionitis. Zanardo et al. demonstrated that WBC counts on the third day of life were strongly associated with histologic chorioamnionitis in preterm neonates. However, Hornik et al. concluded that while low WBC counts, low absolute neutrophil counts, and high immature-to-total neutrophil ratios were associated with increased odds of infection, no complete blood count-derived index had sufficient sensitivity to reliably rule out early onset sepsis in neonates. These findings highlight the complex relationship between WBC counts and neonatal infections and emphasize the need to interpret these markers in clinical practice carefully.

### How long after neutrophil recovery should myeloid growth factors be continued in autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients? [^436e1672]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

Growth factors are routinely used after autotransplantation to accelerate hematopoietic recovery, and are continued until the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is ≥ 0.5 × 10⁹/l on 3 consecutive days. Since ANC often increases to very high levels with this strategy, we discontinued growth factor on the first day ANC reached 0.5 × 10⁹/l in 45 patients (Study Group), and compared their subsequent ANC to 108 historic controls who received growth factor longer. While ANC on the day after reaching 0.5 × 10⁹/l was comparable between groups, ANC on the third day was significantly higher in the Control Group (2.3 vs 4.9 × 10⁹/l; P = 0.0003). When compared to the first day, ANC in the Study Group was higher by a median of 140% on the third day and by 450% in the Control Group (P = 0.0002). A significantly higher proportion of patients experienced a decline in ANC after the first day in the Study Group. However, only one patient in the Study Group became neutropenic transiently and ANC recovered spontaneously the next day. The incidence of fever and hospitalization were comparable. We conclude that growth factors can be discontinued after autotransplantation the day the ANC reaches 0.5 × 10⁹/l, without compromising neutrophil recovery.
