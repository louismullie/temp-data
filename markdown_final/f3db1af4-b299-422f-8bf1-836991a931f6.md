## Question

Dose of Clarithromycin for h pylori

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the standard clarithromycin dose for H. pylori eradication and how to apply it in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled dose and whether it varies by regimen. Then, I should verify the optimal duration and how it differs from older 7–10 day practices. Next, I will review guideline context to ensure when clarithromycin-based therapy is appropriate. After that, I should confirm co-therapies and acid suppression details. Finally, I will consider special populations, adherence, and a concise, clinically actionable summary with caveats about resistance and testing of cure.

> Let me first confirm the dose itself. The FDA labeling consistently states clarithromycin 500 mg orally twice daily for H. pylori triple therapy, with a duration of 10–14 days, and this applies across multiple product sources and years, including the current DailyMed entry and legacy Biaxin labeling, as well as fixed-dose combination products like Prevpac that include clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily [^115DmPJk] [^113zuiMW] [^113jGyQE] [^113oyGhK] [^113jbycq].

> Wait, let me verify the duration because older practice often used 7–10 days. I initially thought 7 days might still be acceptable, but hold on, contemporary guidelines and meta-analyses favor 14 days to maximize eradication. Extending from 7 to 14 days improves cure rates in triple therapy, with a Cochrane analysis showing higher eradication with 14 versus 7 days and modern consensus statements recommending 14 days for most regimens, including clarithromycin triple when used appropriately [^116VE7dV] [^1114UCd6] [^112hCqoz].

> Next, I should review when clarithromycin triple is appropriate, because resistance has changed the landscape. I need to ensure we avoid empiric clarithromycin in areas with resistance above about 15% or in patients with prior macrolide exposure; major guidelines now advise against empiric clarithromycin unless susceptibility is confirmed or the local resistance is known to be low and there is no prior macrolide use, given U.S. resistance rates around 20–30% and the strong association with treatment failure [^112LY2W7] [^112wUATa] [^115StApF].

> I will now examine the regimen components and acid suppression, since clarithromycin's efficacy is sensitive to gastric pH. The standard triple is clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily plus amoxicillin 1 g twice daily plus a proton pump inhibitor at standard dose twice daily for 14 days; if clarithromycin triple is chosen, using a high-dose PPI or a PCAB like vonoprazan can improve outcomes, and ACG suggests PCAB–clarithromycin–amoxicillin triple over PPI–clarithromycin–amoxicillin when no other first-line option is available and macrolide exposure is absent [^116G8XHd] [^116aDG31] [^116Yecyq].

> But wait, what if the patient is treatment-experienced or has persistent infection. I should confirm that repeating clarithromycin after failure is inappropriate unless susceptibility testing proves clarithromycin sensitivity; in that narrow, susceptibility-confirmed scenario, optimized acid suppression and a 14-day clarithromycin triple can be considered, whereas otherwise salvage should avoid previously used antibiotics and favor bismuth quadruple or levofloxacin-based therapy guided by susceptibility and prior exposures [^112YTi4r] [^113om85U] [^111Y5Gb5].

> Let me consider special populations and practicalities. In renal impairment, I need to check for contraindications with certain fixed-dose combinations; for example, Prevpac is not recommended if creatinine clearance is less than 30 mL/min, so I should individualize components and doses in that setting. For pediatrics, weight-based dosing and different first-line strategies apply, and clarithromycin should be reserved for susceptible strains with susceptibility testing prioritized, so adult dosing does not translate directly to children [^113jbycq] [^1116pKQF].

> Hold on, I should verify adherence and test-of-cure because they materially affect outcomes. I need to ensure patients take all doses for the full 14 days and then confirm eradication at least 4 weeks after therapy completion using a urea breath test, stool antigen, or biopsy-based testing, off acid suppression when feasible; this closes the loop on effectiveness and detects early resistance-driven failures [^112Ruq3K].

> Putting this together, the standard clarithromycin dose for H. pylori eradication is 500 mg orally twice daily, typically for 14 days in combination with amoxicillin 1 g twice daily and a standard-dose PPI twice daily, with the important caveat that this regimen should generally be avoided empirically unless clarithromycin susceptibility is confirmed and there is no prior macrolide exposure, given contemporary resistance patterns. When used, optimize acid suppression and confirm cure afterward [^115DmPJk] [^112LY2W7] [^116VE7dV] [^112Ruq3K].

The standard clarithromycin dose for H. pylori eradication is **500 mg orally twice daily for 10–14 days** [^115DmPJk] [^112WxEts], with **14 days preferred** to maximize eradication rates [^116VE7dV] [^1114UCd6]. Use clarithromycin only when **susceptibility is confirmed** or resistance is known to be low (< 15%) [^116GgZ9o] [^115StApF] and the patient has no prior macrolide exposure [^113i3MW3]. For treatment-naive patients with unknown susceptibility, **bismuth quadruple therapy or PCAB-based regimens are preferred** [^112LY2W7] [^117LoDad]; clarithromycin triple therapy is not recommended empirically due to rising resistance [^112wUATa] [^115StApF].

---

## Standard dosing regimen

- **Dose**: 500 mg orally twice daily (every 12 hours) [^115DmPJk] [^112WxEts].
- **Duration**: 10–14 days; 14 days is preferred to optimize eradication rates [^116VE7dV] [^1114UCd6].
- **Combination therapy**: clarithromycin is always used with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and a second antibiotic (typically amoxicillin or metronidazole) [^115DmPJk] [^113oyGhK].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing regimen

Clinical trials and meta-analyses show that **14-day clarithromycin triple therapy** achieves higher eradication rates than 7–10 day regimens [^116VE7dV] [^116isavv]. However, rising clarithromycin resistance has reduced the effectiveness of standard triple therapy, prompting many guidelines to recommend alternative regimens when susceptibility is unknown [^112LY2W7] [^115StApF].

---

## Factors influencing dosing decisions

Several factors influence clarithromycin dosing and regimen selection:

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Clarithromycin resistance significantly reduces eradication success; avoid empiric clarithromycin triple therapy in areas with resistance > 15% [^115StApF] [^111sPPdY].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Prior macrolide exposure, allergies, and comorbidities (e.g. renal impairment) may necessitate dose adjustments or alternative regimens [^113i3MW3] [^113zuiMW].
- **Regional guidelines**: Local resistance patterns and guideline recommendations vary; tailor therapy accordingly [^115e74Cq] [^115StApF].

---

## Alternative regimens and dosing strategies

Given rising resistance, **alternative regimens** are recommended:

| **Regimen** | **Components** | **Dosing** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Bismuth quadruple therapy | - PPI <br/> - Bismuth <br/> - Tetracycline <br/> - Metronidazole | - PPI standard dose BID <br/> - Bismuth 120–300 mg QID <br/> - Tetracycline 500 mg QID <br/> - Metronidazole 500 mg TID/QID | 14 days [^111rJiVX] |
| Concomitant therapy | - PPI <br/> - Clarithromycin <br/> - Amoxicillin <br/> - Metronidazole | - PPI standard dose BID <br/> - Clarithromycin 500 mg BID <br/> - Amoxicillin 1 g BID <br/> - Metronidazole 500 mg BID | 10–14 days [^116SiDUP] |
| PCAB-based regimens | - Vonoprazan <br/> - Amoxicillin <br/> - (Clarithromycin) | - Vonoprazan 20 mg BID <br/> - Amoxicillin 1 g BID <br/> - Clarithromycin 500 mg BID (if susceptible) | 14 days [^111rJiVX] |

---

## Special populations and dose adjustments

- **Renal impairment**: No routine dose adjustment is required for clarithromycin in H. pylori regimens, but caution is advised in severe renal impairment [^113oyGhK].
- **Pediatric patients**: Clarithromycin is dosed at 15 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours for 10–14 days, typically combined with amoxicillin and a PPI [^115rFtZQ] [^113zuiMW].
- **Elderly patients**: No specific dose adjustment is required, but monitor for adverse effects and drug interactions [^notfound].

---

## Clinical outcomes and eradication rates

Clarithromycin triple therapy achieves **eradication rates of approximately 70–85%**, depending on resistance and adherence [^115bTJFm] [^115StApF]. Resistance significantly reduces efficacy, with failure risk increasing sevenfold in resistant strains [^113RYRzQ] [^115StApF].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Clarithromycin is generally well tolerated; common adverse effects include gastrointestinal upset, dysgeusia, and headache. Serious adverse effects (e.g. QT prolongation, hepatotoxicity) are rare but require monitoring, especially in patients with risk factors [^notfound].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **ACG 2024**: Clarithromycin triple therapy is not recommended empirically; use only if susceptibility is confirmed or resistance is low (< 15%) and there is no prior macrolide exposure [^112jtYX7] [^112wUATa].
- **AGA 2021**: Avoid clarithromycin- or levofloxacin-based regimens if there is prior macrolide or fluoroquinolone exposure, respectively [^116Rqvzv].
- **Toronto Consensus**: Restrict clarithromycin triple therapy to areas with known low resistance or high local eradication rates (> 85%) [^116GgZ9o].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard dose**: 500 mg orally twice daily for 10–14 days (prefer 14 days) [^115DmPJk] [^116VE7dV].
- **Use only when**: Susceptibility is confirmed or resistance is low (< 15%) and there is no prior macrolide exposure [^115StApF] [^113i3MW3].
- **Alternative regimens**: Bismuth quadruple therapy, concomitant therapy, or PCAB-based regimens are preferred when susceptibility is unknown or resistance is high [^115XaEn9] [^117LoDad].

---

The standard clarithromycin dose for H. pylori is **500 mg twice daily for 10–14 days**, with 14 days preferred; however, due to rising resistance, use clarithromycin only when susceptibility is confirmed or resistance is low, and consider alternative regimens when susceptibility is unknown [^115DmPJk] [^113UgsGE].

In addition, it is broken down in the liver to a hydroxylated compound that is also active against H pylori. Clarithromycin is unique in that as a single agent it by far has the best activity against H pylori, achieving between 40% to 60% eradication rates. 16 Clarithromycin achieves the best eradication rate when given frequently and in larger doses. 17 Unfortunately, as with metronidazole, when clarithromycin is given as monotherapy, resistance can develop. 17 Clarithromycin can alter the taste sensation, producing a bitter metallic taste that results in noncompliance. Comparable results have been described with lansoprazole and clarithromycin. An eradication rate of 72. 4% was attained with lansoprazole and clarithromycin administered for 2 weeks; however, when a lower dose of lansoprazole was used with the same dose of clarithromycin, the eradication rate declined to 50%.

43 The effectiveness of this dual regimen is dependent on the dose of the proton pump inhibitor and clarithromycin. As mentioned, azithromycin is a new macrolide antibiotic that is very active against H pylori and achieves excellent tissue penetration with a long half-life. In one study, 54 30 patients with H pylori infection were treated with 1 of 2 regimens: 2 tablets of BSS 4 times a day, tetracycline hydrochloride, and either azithromycin for 2 weeks. A smaller study61 evaluated the efficacy of triple therapy using metronidazole, omeprazole, and clarithromycin. Thirty-three patients with documented H pylori infection received omeprazole, clarithromycin, and metronidazole for 2 weeks.

However, when the dose of clarithromycin was decreased to 250 mg twice a day, the eradication rate decreased to 84%, suggesting that the efficacy of this combination is dependent on the dose of clarithromycin. Additionally, the efficacy of this therapy is also dependent on the length of time that it is given.

### "Concomitant" or "sequential" eradication of: which regimen comes first? [^112xYL69]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Summary

"Sequential" or "concomitant" non-bismuth quadruple regimens are currently recommended by the recent updated (Maastricht IV) European guidelines as alternative to bismuth based quadruple regimen first line therapies, in areas with a high rate (over 20%) of clarithromycin resistance. Besides this, there is no trial comparing both regimens in settings with increasing rates of clarithromycin resistance. In a recent prospective, randomized, multicenter, clinical trial, conducted in Spain, McNicholl et al aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of these therapies for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication.

They included a large number of patients (n = 338) with non-investigated/functional dyspepsia (80%) or peptic ulcer disease (20%), naïve to eradication therapy. Mean age was 47 years, 60% were women and 20% smokers. They were randomly assigned to sequential treatment; omeprazole (20 mg/12 h) and amoxycilline (1 g/12 h) for 5 days, followed by 5 days of omeprazole (20 mg/12 h), clarithromycin (500 mg/12 h) and metronidazole (500 mg/12 h)[170 patients (50.3%)] or concomitant treatment; same drugs at the same doses taken concomitantly for 10 days [168 patients (49.7%)]. Eradication was confirmed with 13 C-urea breath test or histology (depending on the indication), at least 4 weeks after treatment. Treatment related adverse events and adherence to treatment were also carefully evaluated.

### Therapeutic eradication choices ininfection in children [^114hjnWB]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Current recommendations on Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication in children differ from adults. In H. pylori -infected adults, the eradication is always recommended because of the risk to develop gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal associated diseases. Instead, before treating infected children, we should consider all the possible causes and not merely focus on H. pylori infection. Indeed, pediatric international guidelines do not recommend the test and treat strategy in children. Therefore, gastroscopy with antimicrobial susceptibility testing by culture on gastric biopsies should be performed before starting the eradication therapy in children to better evaluate all the possible causes of the symptomatology and to increase the eradication rate. Whether antibiotic susceptibility testing is not available, gastroscopy is anyway recommended to better set any possible cause of symptoms and not simply focus on the presence of H. pylori. In children the lower antibiotics availability compared to adults forces to treat based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing to minimize the unsuccessful rates. The main antibiotics used in children are amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole in various combinations. In empirical treatment, triple therapy for 14days based either on local antimicrobial susceptibility or on personal antibiotic history is generally recommended. Triple therapy with high dose of amoxicillin is a valid alternative choice, either in double resistance or in second-line treatment. Moving from therapeutic regimens used in adults, we could also select quadruple therapy with or without bismuth salts. However, all the treatment regimens often entail unpleasant side effects and lower compliance in children. In this review, the alternative and not yet commonly used therapeutic choices in children were also analyzed.

### High-dose esomeprazole and amoxicillin dual therapy for first-line Helicobacter pylori eradication: a proof of concept study [^111tJTrQ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection causes peptic ulcers, gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, and gastric cancer. Standard treatments for H. pylori infection endorsed by the U.S. as well as European scientific societies and by regulatory authorities rely on clarithromycin, metronidazole, or amoxicillin in conjunction with gastric acid inhibitors. Disappointingly, the prevalence of clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance has increased substantially in recent years, and a corresponding decrease has occurred in the eradication rate for H. pylori infection. Indeed, first-line therapy success rate has declined to unacceptable levels in most Western countries. In addition, the primary resistance to levofloxacin – an antibiotic generally used for second-line therapy – is also increasing in several countries. Consequently, to treat H. pylori eradication failure patients is progressively more difficult, suggesting that a highly successful first-line regimen is the key to contrast the phenomenon.

Non-bismuth quadruple therapies

Non-bismuth quadruple therapies include sequential therapy, concomitant therapy, hybrid therapy and reverse hybrid therapy. Figure 3 summarizes the regimens of these non-bismuth quadruple therapies and other novel treatments for H. pylori infection.

Figure 3.
A summary of current anti- H. pylori regimens.

Sequential therapy designed by Zullo et al. consists of a 5-day dual therapy with a PPI (standard dose, b.i.d.) and amoxicillin (1 g, b.i.d.), followed by a 5-day triple therapy with a PPI (standard dose, b.i.d.), clarithromycin (500 mg, b.i.d.) and metronidazole (500 mg, b.i.d.). In a recent prospective randomized controlled trial, 10-day sequential therapy resulted in eradication rates of 95%, 70%, 78% and 43% for non-resistance, single clarithromycin resistance, single metronidazole resistance and dual resistances, respectively. Several randomized controlled trials showed that 10-day sequential therapy was superior to 7-day clarithromycin-based standard triple therapy. However, sequential therapy was only marginally better than 10-day clarithromycin-based triple therapy and not superior to 14-day clarithromycin-based triple therapy or 10- to 14-day bismuth-based quadruple therapy. Furthermore, this therapy is complex and requires changing antibiotics during treatment, potentially reducing patient compliance. Current international consensus guidelines therefore do not recommend 10-day sequential therapy as the preferred option in treating H. pylori infection.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^115StApF]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Statement 9: 14-day clarithromycin-based triple therapy with a high-dose proton pump inhibitor can only be recommended in cases where clarithromycin susceptibility has been confirmed

Recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: moderate.

Since the publication of the IHPWG guidelines in 2017, clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori has been listed on the WHO priority list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. A 2018 meta-analysis of 178 studies from 65 countries involving > 66,000 H. pylori isolates revealed that primary resistance to clarithromycin is now > 15% in all WHO regions except the Americas and Southeast Asia. This same study demonstrated that clarithromycin resistance is significantly associated with the failure of clarithromycin-containing regimens. Subsequent pan-European resistance studies have also reported high average primary clarithromycin resistance rates ranging from 21.3 to 25.0%. Our recent data indicates that primary clarithromycin resistance in Ireland is > 25%. Cumulative data acquired at both the individual patient level and population-based analyses have linked previous exposure to macrolides with clarithromycin resistance in H. pylori.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^111pVZYm]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Statement 11: bismuth quadruple therapy with a high-dose proton pump inhibitor, levofloxacin and amoxicillin for 14 days is the recommended second-line treatment. For those who received antimicrobial susceptibility testing-guided clarithromycin first-line therapy, a combination of proton pump inhibitor, bismuth, metronidazole and tetracycline can be given

Recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low.

Results from recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown no benefit of tailored over empirical second-line and rescue therapy and a failure to reliably achieve cure rates > 90%. The current European recommendations are that empirical second-line and rescue therapy for H. pylori are guided by local resistance surveillance programs and by regularly auditing eradication rates. Primary levofloxacin resistance in Europe is now in the region of 15.8% and is 18.3% (N = 21/115) locally. A local audit from Tallaght University Hospital has shown that the eradication rate for second-line levofloxacin amoxicillin triple therapy was just 68.6%, albeit with a small sample size (N = 35/51; unpublished findings). Data from the Hp-EuReg showed second-line eradication rates increased from 81 to 88% when bismuth was added to levofloxacin amoxicillin triple therapy. Further, the current European Guidelines recommend levofloxacin quadruple therapy (PPI, levofloxacin, amoxicillin and bismuth) as the second line in areas with high clarithromycin resistance. Thus, levofloxacin quadruple therapy (Table 3) is the recommended second-line therapy (Fig. 1). For those who received AST-guided clarithromycin first-line therapy, a combination of PPI, bismuth, metronidazole and tetracycline can be given. The European Medicines Agency has recommended restricted use of fluoroquinolones to infections where the therapeutic benefit outweighs the risk due to rare but serious side effects. Therefore, the use of fluoroquinolones in H. pylori treatment regimens should be restricted to second-line and rescue therapies.

### Levofloxacin or clarithromycin-based quadruple regimens: what is the best alternative as first-line treatment for Helicobacter pylori eradication in a country with high resistance rates for both antibiotics? [^1172yfhz]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Helicobacter pylori eradication rates in Portugal are declining, due to increased resistance of this bacterium to antimicrobial agents, especially Clarithromycin. Quadruple Levofloxacin-containing regimens could be an option for first-line treatment, but its efficacy should be evaluated as fluoroquinolone resistance is rapidly increasing.

Our aim was to compare the efficacy of Clarithromycin and Levofloxacin-based sequential quadruple therapies as first-line treatment options and determine factors associated with treatment failure.

Methods

A total of 200 Helicobacter pylori infected patients were retrospectively included (female 57.5%; average age: 53.2 ± 15.7) and received either 10-day sequential therapy (Proton-Pump Inhibitor + Amoxicillin 1 g bid for 5 days and Proton-Pump Inhibitor + Clarithromycin 500 mg + Metronidazole/Tinidazole 500 mg bid/tid in the following 5 days; group A) or a 10-day modified sequential therapy with Levofloxacin 500 mg id instead of Clarithromycin (group B). Eradication was confirmed with urea breath test. Variables that could influence success rate were analyzed.

Results

There were no differences between groups in terms of gender, age, smoking habits and indications for treatment. The eradication rate obtained with Clarithromycin-based sequential treatment was significantly higher than with Levofloxacin-based therapy (90%, CI95%: 84–96% vs. 79%, CI95%: 71–87%, p = 0.001). Using full-dose proton-pump inhibitor and high-dose Metronidazole in group A, and full-dose proton-pump inhibitor and prescription from a Gastroenterologist in group B were associated with eradication success.

Conclusions

Ten-day Levofloxacin-based sequential treatment achieved inadequate efficacy rate (< 80%) and should not be adopted as first-line therapy. Standard sequential therapy showed significantly better results in this naïve population. Using full-dose proton-pump inhibitor and higher doses of Metronidazole is essential to achieve such results.

### High-dose dual therapyculture-based susceptibility-guided therapy as a rescue regimen forinfection: a randomized controlled trial [^116kYy48]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background:

Although the Maastricht VI/Florence consensus report recommended high-dose proton pump inhibitor–amoxicillin dual therapy as possible rescue therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection, clinical evidence of its efficacy was lacking.

Objectives:

To compare the efficacy, safety, patient compliance, and cost between high-dose dual therapy (HDDT) and culture-based susceptibility-guided therapy (CB-SGT) as a rescue regimen for H. pylori infection.

Design:

A single-center, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial.

Methods:

In all, 146 patients with a history of eradication failure were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive HDDT or CB-SGT. HDDT consisted of esomeprazole 20 mg and amoxicillin 750 mg, both given four times per day (qid). CB-SGT consisted of esomeprazole 20 mg twice daily (bid), amoxicillin 1000 mg bid plus clarithromycin 500 mg bid, metronidazole 400 mg bid, or levofloxacin 500 mg daily (qd) for sensitive patients, in that order. For patients with triple resistance, a bismuth-containing regimen with a high dose of metronidazole was chosen, including esomeprazole 20 mg bid, bismuth 220 mg bid, amoxicillin 1000 mg bid, and metronidazole 400 mg qid. All regimens were given for 14 days.

Results:

The eradication H. pylori rates achieved with HDDT in the intention-to-treat (ITT), per-protocol, and modified ITT analyses were all 84.9% [62/73, 95% confidence interval (CI): 76.5–93.9%], compared with 83.6% (61/73, 95% CI: 74.9–92.3%), 84.7% (61/72, 95% CI: 76.2–93.2%), and 84.7% (61/72, 95% CI: 76.2–93.2%) with CB-SGT, respectively. For patients with CYP2C19 polymorphisms of intermediate/poor metabolizers, the eradication rates of HDDT and CB-SGT were 90.70% (39/43, 95% CI: 77.86–97.41%) and 84.21% (32/38, 95% CI: 68.75–93.98%), respectively. The difference between groups was 6.49% (95% CI: −8.00% to 20.97%), and the non-inferiority p value was 0.0128. For patients with a treatment interval of more than 3 months, the eradication rates of the two regimens reached 88.71% (95% CI: 78.11–95.34%) and 71.97% (95% CI: 70.02–90.64%). The difference between groups was 6.74% (95% CI: −5.71% to 19.20%), with a non-inferiority p value of 0.0042. Patient adherence was high in both groups. The HDDT had a lower cost and rate of side effects (p < 0.001) compared with CB-SGT.

Conclusions:

HDDT can reach an eradication rate of 85% in treatment-experienced patients of H. pylori infection and 91% in patients with CYP2C19 polymorphisms of intermediate/poor metabolizers, with good compliance, lower side effects and costs, and less use of antibiotics. In conclusion, HDDT offers an effective rescue regimen for H. pylori infection.

Registration:

This clinical trial was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trail Registry (trail registration number: ChiCTR1900025044)

### Treatment of Helicobacter pylori [^1127FPYF]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The article will give an overview on reasons for treatment failure and tries to show new concepts for Helicobacter pylori treatment.

Recent Findings

Several new treatment options or modifications of already established regimens have been introduced to overcome treatment failure. Antibiotic resistance to H. pylori is the key factor for treatment failure. At the moment, standard triple therapy remains the primary choice in regions with proven low clarithromycin resistance rates. In areas with high clarithromycin resistance, four drug treatment regimens, including quadruple and sequential therapy, have proven the best results as first-line regimens. The options for second-line treatment regimens are manifold. Second-line treatment regimens need to be adapted accurately to local resistance rates.

Summary

Treatment of H. pylori infection is challenged by a dramatic fall in eradication rates all over the world. Newer regimens have been introduced including sequential, quadruple therapies and those regimens provide promising results, but the knowledge about local resistance rates remains the key to an effective therapy.

Regarding medical management for Helicobacter pylori infection, more specifically with respect to management of treatment failure, choice of regimen, AGA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider administering an adequate dose of metronidazole (1.5–2 g daily in divided doses) with concomitant bismuth therapy when using metronidazole-containing regimens to improve eradication rates irrespective of observed in vitro metronidazole resistance.

### Optimum duration of regimens for Helicobacter pylori eradication [^116VE7dV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication therapy is controversial, with recommendations ranging from 7 to 14 days. Several systematic reviews have attempted to address this issue but have given conflicting results and limited their analysis to proton pump inhibitor (PPI), two antibiotics (PPI triple) therapy. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the optimal duration of multiple H. pylori eradication regimens.

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the relative effectiveness of different durations (7, 10 or 14 days) of a variety of regimens for eradicating H. pylori. The primary outcome was H. pylori persistence. The secondary outcome was adverse events.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched up to December 2011 to identify eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also searched the proceedings of six conferences from 1995 to 2011, dissertations and theses, and grey literature. There were no language restrictions applied to any search.

Only parallel group RCTs assessing the efficacy of one to two weeks duration of first line H. pylori eradication regimens in adults were eligible. Within each regimen, the same combinations of drugs at the same dose were compared over different durations. Studies with at least two arms comparing 7, 10, or 14 days were eligible. Enrolled participants needed to be diagnosed with at least one positive test for H. pylori on the basis of a rapid urease test (RUT), histology, culture, urea breath test (UBT), or a stool antigen test (HpSA) before treatment. Eligible trials needed to confirm eradication of H. pylori as their primary outcome at least 28 days after completion of eradication treatment. Trials using only serology or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine H. pylori infection or eradication were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study eligibility and data extraction were performed by two independent review authors. Data analyses were performed within each type of intervention, for both primary and secondary outcomes. The relative risk (RR) and number needed to treat (NNT)/number needed to harm (NNTH) according to duration of therapy were calculated using the outcomes of H. pylori persistence and adverse events. A random-effects model was used. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were planned a priori.

Main Results

In total, 75 studies met the inclusion criteria. Eight types of regimens were reported with at least two comparative eligible durations. They included: PPI + two antibiotics triple therapy (n = 59), PPI bismuth-based quadruple therapy (n = 6), PPI + three antibiotics quadruple therapy (n = 1), PPI dual therapy (n = 2), histamine H2-receptor antagonist (H₂RA) bismuth quadruple therapy (n = 3), H₂RA bismuth-based triple therapy (n = 2), H₂RA + two antibiotics triple therapy (n = 3), and bismuth + two antibiotics triple therapy (n = 2). Some studies provided data for more than one regimen or more than two durations. For the PPI triple therapy, 59 studies with five regimens were reported: PPI + clarithromycin + amoxicillin (PCA); PPI + clarithromycin + a nitroimidazole (PCN); PPI + amoxicillin + nitroimidazole (PAN); PPI + amoxicillin + a quinolone (PAQ); and PPI + amoxicillin + a nitrofuran (PANi). Regardless of type and dose of antibiotics, increased duration of PPI triple therapy from 7 to 14 days significantly increased the H. pylori eradication rate (45 studies, 72.9% versus 81.9%), the RR for H. pylori persistence was 0.66 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.74), NNT was 11 (95% CI 9 to 14). Significant effects were seen in the subgroup of PCA (34 studies, RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.75; NNT 12, 95% CI 9 to 16); PAN (10 studies, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.86; NNT = 11, 95% CI 8 to 25); and in PAQ (2 studies, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.83; NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 10); but not in PCN triple therapy (4 studies, RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.07). Significantly increased eradication rates were also seen for PPI triple therapy with 10 versus 7 days (24 studies, 79.9% versus 75.7%; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.89; NNT 21, 95% CI 15 to 38) and 14 versus 10 days (12 studies, 84.4% versus 78.5%; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.90; NNT 17, 95% CI 11 to 46); especially in the subgroup of PAC for 10 versus 7 days (17 studies, RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.91) and for 14 versus 10 days (10 studies, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.91). A trend towards increased H. pylori eradication rates was seen with increased duration of PCN for 10 versus 7 days, and of PAN for 10 versus 7 days and 14 versus 10 days, though this was not statistical significant. The proportion of patients with adverse events, defined by authors, was marginally significantly increased only between 7 days and 14 days (15.5% versus 19.4%; RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.37; NNTH 31, 95% CI 18 to 104) but not for other duration comparisons. The proportion of patients discontinuing treatment due to adverse events was not significantly different between treatment durations. Only limited data were reported for different durations of regimens other than PPI triple therapy. No significant difference of the eradication rate was seen for all regimens according to different durations except for H₂RA bismuth quadruple therapy, where a significantly higher eradication rate was seen for 14 days versus 7 days, however only one study reported outcome data.

Authors' Conclusions

Increasing the duration of PPI-based triple therapy increases H. pylori eradication rates. For PCA, prolonging treatment duration from 7 to 10 or from 10 to 14 days is associated with a significantly higher eradication rate. The optimal duration of therapy for PCA and PAN is at least 14 days. More data are needed to confirm if there is any benefit of increasing the duration of therapy for PCN therapy. Information is limited for regimens other than PPI triple therapy; more studies are needed to draw meaningful conclusions for optimal duration of other H. pylori eradication regimens.

### The Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of H. pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^111k3mtX]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Irish eradication rates for Helicobacter pylori are decreasing and there is an increase in the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These trends call into question current management strategies.

Objective

To establish an Irish Helicobacter pylori Working Group (IHPWG) to assess, revise and tailor current available recommendations.

Methods

Experts in the areas of gastroenterology and microbiology were invited to join the IHPWG. Questions of relevance to diagnosis, first-line and rescue therapy were developed using the PICO system. A literature search was performed. The 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation' approach was then used to rate the quality of available evidence and grade the resulting recommendations.

Results

Key resultant IHPWG statements (S), the strength of recommendation and quality of evidence include S8: standard triple therapy for 7 days' duration can no longer be recommended (strong and moderate). S9: 14 days of clarithromycin-based triple therapy with a high-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is recommended as first-line therapy. Bismuth quadruple therapy for 14 days is an alternative if available (strong and moderate). S12: second-line therapy depends on the first-line treatment and should not be the same treatment. The options are (a) 14 days of levofloxacin-based therapy with high-dose PPI, (b) 14 days of clarithromycin-based triple therapy with high-dose PPI or (c) bismuth quadruple therapy for 14 days (strong and moderate). S13: culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be performed following two treatment failures (weak and low/very low).

Conclusion

These recommendations are intended to provide the most relevant current best-practice guidelines for the management of H. pylori infection in adults in Ireland.

Statement 6: antimicrobial susceptibility testing by culture or a locally validated molecular method should be performed for national resistance surveillance and before prescribing clarithromycin-containing first-line therapy

Recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: moderate.

Resistance to many of the antimicrobials used to treat H. pylori has been increasing over time, and there are geographical variations in resistance patterns, which are influenced by previous antibiotic exposure in each region. With respect to antimicrobial stewardship, resistance surveillance is recommended to determine the most appropriate H. pylori eradication regimens in a given population. In addition, European guidelines recommend avoiding the use of first-line clarithromycin triple therapy without prior AST in areas with high or unknown clarithromycin resistance (see statement 9).

Culture-based methods are considered the gold standard for H. pylori AST and provide the opportunity to determine susceptibility to all classes of antimicrobials used to treat H. pylori. Disc diffusion criteria have not been defined for H. pylori, and a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method should be used. For this purpose, the European Helicobacter and Microbiota study group recommends ETEST strips (bioMérieux), which are plastic strips calibrated with a predefined concentration gradient of each antimicrobial. Clinical MIC breakpoints for H. pylori antimicrobial resistance are provided by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and are regularly updated. The most up-to-date MIC resistance breakpoints are as follows: > 0.125 mg/L for amoxicillin, > 1 mg/L for levofloxacin, > 0.25 mg/L for clarithromycin, > 1 mg/L for tetracycline, > 1 mg/L for rifampicin and > 8 mg/L for metronidazole (EUCAST, Clinical Breakpoint Tables Version 14.0, valid from 1 January 2024).

### Joint ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN guidelines for the management of Helicobacter pylori in children and adolescents (update 2016) [^1179wb3Q]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Because of the changing epidemiology of Helicobacter pylori infection and low efficacy of currently recommended therapies, an update of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition/North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition recommendations for the diagnosis and management of H pylori infection in children and adolescents is required.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature (time period: 2009–2014) was performed. Representatives of both societies evaluated the quality of evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) to formulate recommendations, which were voted upon and finalized using a Delphi process and face-to-face meeting.

Results

The consensus group recommended that invasive diagnostic testing for H pylori be performed only when treatment will be offered if tests are positive. To reach the aim of a 90% eradication rate with initial therapy, antibiotics should be tailored according to susceptibility testing. Therapy should be administered for 14 days, emphasizing strict adherence. Clarithromycin-containing regimens should be restricted to children infected with susceptible strains. When antibiotic susceptibility profiles are not known, high-dose triple therapy with proton pump inhibitor, amoxicillin, and metronidazole for 14 days or bismuth-based quadruple therapy is recommended. Success of therapy should be monitored after 4 to 8 weeks by reliable noninvasive tests.

Conclusions

The primary goal of clinical investigation is to identify the cause of upper gastrointestinal symptoms rather than H pylori infection. Therefore, we recommend against a test and treat strategy. Decreasing eradication rates with previously recommended treatments call for changes to first-line therapies and broader availability of culture or molecular-based testing to tailor treatment to the individual child.

### High dose PPI-amoxicillin dual therapy for the treatment ofinfection: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^1175tM4k]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Helicobacter pylori infection is a considerable public health problem, which affects 24% of people in Oceania, 37% in North America, 47% in Europe, 55% in Asia, 63% in Latin America and Caribbean, and 79% in Africa. H. pylori is associated with many upper gastrointestinal diseases, such as chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma; eradication of H. pylori may prevent the development of these diseases.

Standard triple therapy (TT), which consists of proton pump inhibitor (PPI), amoxicillin, clarithromycin, or metronidazole, was recommended as the first-line eradication therapy. Unfortunately, increasing resistance to antibiotics impaired the efficacy of standard TT. The prevalence of clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance was more than 15% in many regions, and standard TT could no longer cure even 80% of infections. Therefore, alternative regimens have been introduced, including bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT), non-bismuth quadruple therapy (non-BQT, also known as concomitant therapy), and sequential therapy (ST). Although these regimens could achieve acceptable eradication rates, the complexity and adverse events of multi-drug regimens may reduce the patient compliance. Moreover, using multi-antibiotics regimens may result in multi-drug resistance and limit the options of antibiotics for subsequent therapy if the eradication treatment is failed.

Unlike clarithromycin and metronidazole, H. pylori resistance to amoxicillin has remained rare in many regions.PPI-amoxicillin dual therapy has been used for treating H. pylori infection for decades, but its efficacy remains controversial. The efficacy of PPI-amoxicillin dual therapy with standard dose and frequency was unacceptable (< 80%), whereas higher eradication rates were attained when PPI and amoxicillin were given at high dose and frequency. High dose dual therapy (HDDT), which gives amoxicillin and PPI more than two times daily, was reported equally effective to TT or BQT. However, some studies showed that the eradication rates of HDDT were less than 80%. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of HDDT with other regimens.

ACG clinical guideline — Recommendation 4: In treatment-naive patients with Helicobacter pylori infection and unknown clarithromycin susceptibility, PCAB-clarithromycin triple therapy is suggested over PPI-clarithromycin triple therapy (conditional recommendation; moderate quality evidence). We advise against the use of clarithromycin in any treatment regimen unless there is evidence that a patient is infected with a clarithromycin-sensitive strain of H. pylori; if susceptibility is not known and there is no history of macrolide use and no alternative first-line therapy is available, evidence supports a 14-day, twice-daily triple regimen that includes clarithromycin and amoxicillin with a potassium-competitive acid blocker (PCAB) instead of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). In prespecified analyses, vonoprazan-clarithromycin triple therapy was superior among clarithromycin-resistant strains (eradication rates by mITT 66% vs 32%, P < 0.0001) and in the entire study population (mITT 81% vs 69%, P < 0.0003); diarrhea (4%) and dysgeusia (4%) were the most commonly reported adverse events. A network meta-analysis reported vonoprazan-based triple therapy had 72% probability of being the most efficacious.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^112fRAqc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

10 days of sequential therapy with four drugs (amoxicillin, clarythromicin, metronidazole, and PPI) is recommended in selected cases, if compliance to the scheduled regimen can be maintained, and if clarithromycin high resistance is detected (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidences, 1C).

In patients with HP positive tests, a 10-day levofloxacin-amoxicillin triple therapy is recommended as second-line therapy if first-line therapy failed (strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidences, 1B).

We recommend to start standard triple therapy (STT) after 72–96 h of intravenous administration of PPI and to administer it for 14 days (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidences, 1C)

The worldwide prevalence of H. pylori infections is approximately 50%, with the highest being in developing countries. Standard treatments for H. pylori infections have been endorsed by Western scientific societies, and by regulatory authorities relying on clarithromycin, metronidazole, or amoxicillin in conjunction with PPI.

As the response to eradication therapy is significantly related to the prevalence of primary resistance in the population, the choice of treatment regimen should be based on the knowledge of the underlying prevalence of resistant strains in the community.

Several international guidelines and available meta-analysis recommend that standard triple therapy (amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and PPI) regimen should be used as first-line therapy if low clarithromycin resistance is present. The suggested doses are:
PPI standard dose twice a day;
Clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day;
Amoxicillin 1000 mg twice a day, or
Metronidazole 500 mg twice a day.

Sequential therapy with four drugs (amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, and PPI) should be considered in selected cases, if compliance to the scheduled regimen can be maintained, and if clarithromycin high resistance is detected. It is defined as the use of one PPI and amoxicillin for the first 5 days followed by PPI plus clarithromycin and metronidazole for the next 5 days. Recommended doses are as follows:
PPI standard dose twice a day;
Amoxicilllin 1000 mg twice a day;
Clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day;
Metronidazole 500 mg twice a day.

If any of these regimens failed, a second-line therapy is represented by a 10-day levofloxacin-amoxicillin triple therapy. The suggested doses are:
PPI standard dose twice a day;
Levofloxacin 500 mg once a day or 250 twice a day;
Amoxicillin 1000 mg twice a day.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^112YTi4r]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori — clarithromycin triple therapy as salvage is limited to susceptibility-confirmed cases and requires optimized acid suppression. Key concept states that in treatment-experienced patients with persistent H. pylori infection that is confirmed to be clarithromycin-sensitive, PPI- or PCAB-clarithromycin triple therapy is suggested. Because eradication is critically dependent on adequate gastric acid suppression (intragastric pH > 6), every effort should be made to optimize aspects of treatment known to influence success, particularly when clarithromycin triple therapy is used as salvage; this includes attention to adherence and optimization of gastric acid suppression. The only clinical scenario in which clarithromycin triple therapy could be repeated after failure of PPI-clarithromycin triple therapy is if H. pylori sensitivity to clarithromycin and amoxicillin has been demonstrated on antibiotic susceptibility testing and there is opportunity to optimize acid suppression, and for such patients the guideline panel suggests using esomeprazole or rabeprazole or a PCAB in the salvage regimen if not already used in the previous regimen.

### Pharmacological regimens for eradication of Helicobacter pylori: an overview of systematic reviews and network meta-analysis [^112tevmQ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) is one of the most common human infections with a worldwide prevalence of approximately 50%. In the United States (US) and Europe, the prevalence of H.pylori is estimated to be 20% to 50%, varying in different socioeconomic, age and ethnic groups and geography. In developing countries, the prevalence has been reported to be as high as 70%. H.pylori is usually latent and asymptomatic; however, increasing evidence has demonstrated the link between H.pylori infection and the pathogenesis of a series of upper gastrointestinal diseases: functional dyspepsia, chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid-tissue lymphoma.

Eradication of H.pylori has been shown to be associated with increased rate of peptic ulcer healing and reduced risk of gastric cancer. Standard triple therapy, which includes a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), clarithromycin, and amoxicillin or metronidazole, is recommended as first-line eradication therapy for H.pylori infection in clinical guidelines worldwide. A treatment alternative also widely recommended is bismuth-based quadruple therapy, which contains a PPI or H 2 receptor antagonist (H 2 RA), bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline. Other treatment options include varying individual drugs within the triple therapy and quadruple therapy based regimens. More recently, sequential therapy of these multiple treatment options also has been introduced. In the US, the American College of Gastroenterology guideline (2007) recommends clarithromycin-based triple therapy for first-line eradication in patients who have not previously been treated with clarithromycin and are not allergic to penicillin. For patients who are allergic to penicillin or have previously received a macrolide antibiotic, a bismuth quadruple therapy is preferred.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Best Practice Advice 8–11 for refractory H pylori infection state that longer treatment durations provide greater eradication success than shorter durations (eg, 14 days vs 7 days) and whenever possible longer durations should be selected. In some cases there should be shared decision making regarding ongoing attempts to eradicate H pylori, weighing benefits against adverse effects and inconvenience of repeated exposure to antibiotics and high-dose acid suppression. With confirmed patient adherence, H pylori susceptibility testing should be considered to guide selection of subsequent regimens. Compiling local data on eradication success rates for each regimen and relevant patient factors is important, and aggregated data should be made publicly available to guide local selection of therapy.

### Brief communication: global temporal trends in the efficacy of clarithromycin-based regimens for the treatment ofinfection [^113RYRzQ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the most common chronic bacterial infection, estimated to infect up to half of the world's population, ranging from 20% to 50% in industrialized countries and up to 80% in developing countries. Because of the established role of H. pylori in gastroduodenal disease, current clinical guidelines recommend eradication therapy for all patients diagnosed with active infection. Careful selection of first-line eradication therapy is important to guarantee high efficacy and limit the risk of antibiotic resistance.

Clarithromycin-based eradication therapies were successfully introduced in the 1990swhen their efficacy was at its peak and 7-day omeprazole–clarithromycin–amoxicillin treatment demonstrated an eradication rate of 94%. Up until around the 2000s, reported clarithromycin resistance rates in H. pylori were generally at or below 10%. However, between 2001 and 2014, clarithromycin resistance increased dramatically to over 20% in the United States, Europe, and Asia, with rates as high as 60% reported in some countries. In the United States, current resistance rates to clarithromycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole are all above 30%. Infection with a clarithromycin-resistant strain of H. pylori has been associated with a sevenfold risk of treatment failure among patients who receive clarithromycin-containing regimens. Published literature suggests that eradication rates achieved with available regimens, particularly those containing clarithromycin, are declining; however, data regarding changes in the efficacy of clarithromycin-based eradication regimens over time are scarce.

Novel approaches are needed to mitigate the effects of antibiotic resistance and offer effective empiric eradication of H. pylori infection. Vonoprazan is a novel potassium-competitive acid blockerthat provides more potent and durable acid suppression than traditional proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Recent trial data suggest that substituting vonoprazan for PPI in clarithromycin-based triple regimens improves eradication rates. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of clarithromycin-based triple regimens, including vonoprazan-based triple therapy, over time.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^115XaEn9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a common worldwide infection that is an important cause of peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. H. pylori may also have a role in uninvestigated and functional dyspepsia, ulcer risk in patients taking low-dose aspirin or starting therapy with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. While choosing a treatment regimen for H. pylori, patients should be asked about previous antibiotic exposure and this information should be incorporated into the decision-making process. For first-line treatment, clarithromycin triple therapy should be confined to patients with no previous history of macrolide exposure who reside in areas where clarithromycin resistance amongst H. pylori isolates is known to be low. Most patients will be better served by first-line treatment with bismuth quadruple therapy or concomitant therapy consisting of a PPI, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole. When first-line therapy fails, a salvage regimen should avoid antibiotics that were previously used. If a patient received a first-line treatment containing clarithromycin, bismuth quadruple therapy or levofloxacin salvage regimens are the preferred treatment options. If a patient received first-line bismuth quadruple therapy, clarithromycin or levofloxacin-containing salvage regimens are the preferred treatment options. Details regarding the drugs, doses and durations of the recommended and suggested first-line and salvage regimens can be found in the guideline.

### Hellenic consensus oninfection [^113SSomB]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Recommendation grade: A; Evidence level: 1c; Agreement level: 90.9%

The goal of a first-line treatment in patients with H. pylori infection is to reach ≥ 90% eradication rate, although this has rarely been achievable in real-world settings, especially in areas with high clarithromycin resistance.

Many RCTs and meta-analyses have consistently shown that clarithromycin resistance has a detrimental effect on the efficacy of clarithromycin-containing regimens. In contrast, metronidazole resistance can be partially overcome by increasing the dose, frequency, and treatment duration.

It has been shown that, under the standard triple regimen, the mean eradication rate may be substantially lower (up to 70%) for clarithromycin-resistant strains. In sequential regimens, clarithromycin resistance lowers the efficacy of 14- and 10-day regimens by 31% and 33%, respectively, whereas metronidazole resistance lowers the efficacy of 14- and 10-day regimens to a lesser extent (by 8% and 20%, respectively). A concomitant regimen seems to perform better than a sequential one across different patterns of resistance (see supplementary material of). Eradication rates for isolated clarithromycin-resistant, isolated metronidazole-resistant and dual-resistant strains were: 71% vs. 87%, 86% vs. 98% and 47% vs. 78%, respectively, for sequential vs. concomitant regimens. A multicenter study from Greece, by Georgopoulos et al, has shown that clarithromycin resistance undermined both sequential and concomitant regimens, but the sequential regimen was additionally undermined by metronidazole resistance. Concomitant regimens achieved higher eradication rates than sequential ones of the same duration across all resistance patterns of H. pylori, but the difference reached statistical significance only in metronidazole-resistant strains.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^113om85U]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori — treatment-experienced patients regimen selection — in summary, optimized BQT for 14 days is the preferred option for treatment-experienced patients with persistent H. pylori infection who have not been treated with optimized BQT previously and for whom the H. pylori resistance profile is unknown. If bismuth and/or tetracycline is unavailable, or in individuals previously treated with optimized BQT, rifabutin triple therapy for 14 days is a suitable alternative. For patients with persistent infection after optimized BQT and/or rifabutin triple therapy, or in whom rifabutin therapy cannot be used (e.g., because of true penicillin allergy), antibiotic susceptibility testing is recommended to guide further therapy with salvage regimens containing clarithromycin or levofloxacin. In patients who are known to be infected with clarithromycin-sensitive H. pylori and who have not received clarithromycin triple therapy with recommended doses of clarithromycin and amoxicillin, optimized PPI- or PCAB-clarithromycin triple therapy for 14 days is a viable option. In individuals who have not previously received a levofloxacin-containing regimen and who are known to be infected with a levofloxacin-sensitive strain of H. pylori, levofloxacin triple therapy for 14 days is a viable option, acknowledging and considering the safety concerns and black-box warning. There is insufficient evidence to offer a recommendation for HDDT for treatment-experienced patients with persistent infection in a North American population.

### Antibiotic treatment of patients with H. pylori… [^115sVRor]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Eradication of H. pylori is indicated in patients with proven peptic ulcers. The benefits to other H. pylori–positive, dyspeptic patients are currently unclear. In populations with a high incidence of ulcer disease, the authors recommend antibiotic treatment for all H. pylori-positive, dyspeptic patients. The two main antibiotics used are metronidazole and clarithromycin. Antibiotic resistance against these two medications is clinically important; both appear to be equally effective. Good clinical evidence of efficacy has been provided for several triple or quadruple antibiotic therapies. These therapies are associated with cure rates of 80 to 90 percent based on intention to treat or completion of therapy, respectively. Therapies combining only a proton pump inhibitor and amoxicillin or clarithromycin are no longer regarded as effective. Several treatment regimens have been shown to be effective, but no single treatment regimen is considered the final treatment of choice.

Triple regimens consist of metronidazole, tetracycline or amoxicillin, and a bismuth compound. These regimens are cost effective but may cause side effects. In metronidazole-sensitive strains, high cure rates are obtained after seven days, but 14 days of therapy are recommended to optimize eradication. Although side effects are common, they are not generally severe and have not led to noncompliance in clinical trials. More recent triple therapies have replaced bismuth with a proton pump inhibitor and reduced the treatment period to seven days. The optimal regimen for sensitive strains may be a twice-daily dosage of 20 mg of omeprazole, 1, 000 mg of amoxicillin and 500 mg of clarithromycin. Some regimens substitute metronidazole for clarithromycin. In areas with a high prevalence of resistant strains, therapy should continue for 10 to 14 days. An alternative triple therapy replaces the proton pump inhibitor with ranitidine bismuth citrate.

Although providing less acid suppression, these regimens add the antimicrobial action of bismuth. Quadruple regimens add proton pump inhibitors to bismuth triple regimens. The most effective quadruple regimens include tetracycline and metronidazole and are the most complicated to follow. In metronidazole-sensitive strains, cure rates may be high after four days, but at least seven days of treatment are recommended.

### Clarithromycin sustained-release tablet may be an improper therapy for the eradication of… [^112jLbzw]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Clarithromycin is a macrocyclic lipid antibiotic that is widely utilized in the treatment of H. pylori infection as reported previously. However, guidelines do not specify the preferred form of clarithromycin dosage for treating H. pylori infection. At our hospital, both dispersible and sustained-release tablets have been used and both forms of dosage have exhibited similar rates of adverse events, with sustained-release tablets featuring lower drug concentrations than dispersible tablets. Further research is required to determine whether they have the same efficacy as the regular formulation in the treatment of H. pylori, especially in the context of drug resistance.

This study aimed to assess the efficacy of different forms of clarithromycin dosage for the treatment of H. pylori infection. In this retrospective study, the eradication rate and risk factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, age, sex, and PPI type that could affect the efficacy of bismuth-containing quadruple therapy were compared among different dosage forms of clarithromycin for eradicating H. pylori infection.

ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN therapy when susceptibility is unknown or with dual resistance in pediatric Helicobacter pylori: Based on prior literature and adult data, we conditionally recommend bismuth quadruple therapy (where available) in children if H pylori antimicrobial susceptibility is unknown or in the setting of dual resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole. The other recommended therapy in this setting is high-dose amoxicillin triple therapy with metronidazole. Supporting data include that in 1 small open multicenter European study of children infected with clarithromycin- and metronidazole-resistant strains, eradication rates using high-dose amoxicillin and PPI with metronidazole were 65% in intention to treat analysis. Adult evidence also indicates that concomitant quadruple therapy (PPI and amoxicillin, metronidazole, and clarithromycin given for 10 to 14 days) was one of the most effective treatments, and the most recent adult international practice guidelines recommend concomitant therapy as a first-line option.

### A randomized trial of standard-dose versus half-dose rabeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^113Uwon7]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a standard-dose versus half-dose 10-day triple regimen for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection.

Methods

A total of 115 consecutive patients with documented infection were enrolled in this open-label trial. Group A (standard dose) received rabeprazole (20 mg), amoxicillin (1 g), and clarithromycin (500 mg), all twice daily for 10 days. Group B (half dose) received rabeprazole (10 mg), amoxicillin (500 mg), and clarithromycin (250 mg), all twice daily for 10 days. (14)C urea breath tests were performed a minimum of 4 weeks after treatment and a minimum of 2 weeks off any acid-suppressive therapy. Compliance and adverse effects were evaluated throughout the treatment period.

Results

A total of 115 patients were enrolled (59 women and 56 men; mean age 47.1 ± 14.0 years). Eradication occurred in 45 of 58 patients [77.6%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 66.9–88.3%] in the standard-dose group versus 44 of 57 in the half-dose group (77.2%; 95% CI: 66.3–88.1%) on an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis (P = 1.00). Per protocol eradication rates were 45 of 57 (78.9%; 95% CI: 68.4–85.9%) and 44 of 54 (81.5%; 95% CI: 71.1–91.8%), respectively (P = 0.81). The number of patients reporting any adverse effect was significantly higher in the standard-dose group (64.9 vs. 40.4%; P = 0.014). The cost of treatment was significantly less in patients receiving the half-dose regimen (ITT analysis; P < 0.05). The number needed to harm to suffer one additional failure in the half-dose over the standard-dose arm was 250 (ITT analysis).

Conclusion

A half-dose 10-day regimen of rabeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin is equally effective but cheaper and better tolerated than its standard-dose regimen in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori. Eradication rates of both regimens are, however, suboptimal compared with accepted standards.

### Therapeutic eradication choices ininfection in children [^116qiDeJ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Current recommendations on Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication in children differ from adults. In H. pylori -infected adults, the eradication is always recommended because of the risk to develop gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal associated diseases. Instead, before treating infected children, we should consider all the possible causes and not merely focus on H. pylori infection. Indeed, pediatric international guidelines do not recommend the test and treat strategy in children. Therefore, gastroscopy with antimicrobial susceptibility testing by culture on gastric biopsies should be performed before starting the eradication therapy in children to better evaluate all the possible causes of the symptomatology and to increase the eradication rate. Whether antibiotic susceptibility testing is not available, gastroscopy is anyway recommended to better set any possible cause of symptoms and not simply focus on the presence of H. pylori. In children the lower antibiotics availability compared to adults forces to treat based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing to minimize the unsuccessful rates. The main antibiotics used in children are amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole in various combinations. In empirical treatment, triple therapy for 14 days based either on local antimicrobial susceptibility or on personal antibiotic history is generally recommended. Triple therapy with high dose of amoxicillin is a valid alternative choice, either in double resistance or in second-line treatment. Moving from therapeutic regimens used in adults, we could also select quadruple therapy with or without bismuth salts. However, all the treatment regimens often entail unpleasant side effects and lower compliance in children. In this review, the alternative and not yet commonly used therapeutic choices in children were also analyzed.

### First-line therapies foreradication: a critical reappraisal of updated guidelines [^116isavv]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clarithromycin-based triple therapies

In the last two decades, H. pylori treatment has been largely focused on triple therapies based on clarithromycin, which is the most powerful antibiotic against H. pylori strains. To date, there is well documented evidence regarding the decreasing efficacy of these regimens as a result of the increased prevalence of primary resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole. Following standard 7-day triple therapies, an eradication rate less than 80% has repeatedly been reported in several countries, so that a 14-day regimen has been proposed to improve the success rate. A recent Cochrane systematic review and a large network meta-analysis found that the prolonged 14-day regimen achieves a higher eradication rate compared to the 7- and 10-day schedules, although the therapeutic gain was only +8%. However, a 7-day triple therapy is still recommended in all Eastern guidelines apart from the Chinese, mainly depending on a particular prescriptive policy for antimicrobial drugs (Table 1). Conversely, among western guidelines, only one suggests the use of a 7-day triple therapy, whilst European, American and Canadian, but not Spanish, guidelines conditionally recommend a 14-day regimen, limiting its use in those geographic areas to low (< 15%) clarithromycin resistance and for patients not previously exposed to macrolides (Table 2). Surprisingly, the use of a 14-day triple therapy is still suggested in the Italian guidelines, even though the primary clarithromycin resistance rate is definitely > 15% in Italy. Moreover, there are only 3 studies on 14-day triple therapy performed in Italy, which concordantly found that the success rate was lower than 75% and 80% in intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol analyses, respectively (Table 3). Unfortunately, the eradication rate of 14-day triple therapy was not significantly increased even by using a double-dose proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) (i.e. esomeprazole 40 mg b.i.d.). Therefore, the recommendation for using a 14-day triple therapy in the updated Italian guidelines would appear at least questionable. For instance, based on the disappointing results of national studies, the Spanish guidelines wisely excluded 14-day triple therapies from the recommended treatments. In contrast, in Latin America, the cure rate following the 14-day clarithromycin–amoxicillin triple therapy (82.2%) was higher than that of either concomitant (73.6%) or sequential (76.5%) therapies, most probably because of the very high (> 80%) prevalence of metronidazole resistance in the H. pylori strains. Therefore, the same therapy regimen may be more successful in a specific geographic area than in another.

### Treatment of Helicobacter pylori [^1154z6mc]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Helicobacter pylori eradication has become more challenging over the past decade due to increasing antimicrobial resistance, especially to clarithromycin and levofloxacin. We identified 508 recent publications on H. pylori treatment (published between January 2018 and June 2019), focusing on the most highly clinically relevant for this review.

Recent Findings

Declining H. pylori eradication rates with clarithromycin triple therapy have led to most guidelines recommending 14 days bismuth-based quadruple therapy or concomitant therapy as the best initial empiric regimen. Substituting amoxicillin for tetracycline or metronidazole in quadruple therapy, and a three-in-one pill version of the regimen, also appear effective. Vonoprazan, a potent acid inhibitor, can overcome much clarithromycin resistance in triple therapy. High-dose dual therapy (proton pump inhibitor with amoxicillin) is a promising alternative approach. Reviewing resistance patterns to select suitable first-line empiric therapies is important in high resistance regions. Molecular methods to evaluate H. pylori antimicrobial susceptibility promise to be simpler than standard microbiological culture. The cost-effectiveness of antimicrobial susceptibility testing in refractory cases remains unproven.

Summary

Updating clinicians treating H. pylori is important to combat the emerging problems of multidrug antimicrobial resistance in H. pylori strains. Truly novel approaches to H. pylori eradication are needed.

### Room for improvement in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection: lessons from the European registry on H. pylori management (Hp-euReg) [^112HrFib]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Managing Helicobacter pylori infection requires constant decision making, and each decision is open to possible errors.

Aim

The aim was to evaluate common mistakes in the eradication of H. pylori, based on the "European Registry on Helicobacter pylori management".

Methods

European Registry on Helicobacter pylori management is an international multicentre prospective noninterventional registry evaluating the decisions and outcomes of H. pylori management by European gastroenterologists in routine clinical practice.

Results

Countries recruiting more than 1000 patients were included (26,340 patients). The most common mistakes (percentages) were: (1) To use the standard triple therapy where it is ineffective (46%). (2) To prescribe eradication therapy for only 7 to 10 days (69%). (3) To use a low dose of proton pump inhibitors (48%). (4) In patients allergic to penicillin, to prescribe always a triple therapy with clarithromycin and metronidazole (38%). (5) To repeat certain antibiotics after eradication failure (> 15%). (6) Failing to consider the importance of compliance with treatment (2%). (7) Not to check the eradication success (6%). Time-trend analyses showed progressive greater compliance with current clinical guidelines.

Conclusion

The management of H. pylori infection by some European gastroenterologists is heterogeneous, frequently suboptimal and discrepant with current recommendations. Clinical practice is constantly adapting to updated recommendations, although this shift is delayed and slow.

### Beyond maastricht IV: are standard empiric triple therapies for Helicobacter pylori still useful in a south-European country? [^1149hgBN]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Over the last two decades, widespread use of certain antibiotics has progressively decreased H. pylori antimicrobial susceptibility. Resistance to CLARI and fluoroquinolones develops rapidly and cannot be overcome by increasing dose or duration of therapy. The only way to identify effective drug combinations is to regularly monitor the success of H. pylori eradication and antibiotic resistance in every region.

Although PPI-CLARI-amoxicillin is probably the most common anti- H. pylori treatment, its eradication rates have decreased as resistance to antibiotics, particularly macrolides, rises. Almost all consensus statements and reviews still recommend it, although some authors suggest longer therapy duration (10–14 days instead of 7 days) or avoiding this regimen in regions where H. pylori resistance to CLARI is higher than 15–20%.

### Update on the first-line treatment ofinfection in areas with high and low clarithromycin resistances [^1171xTEx]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the principal cause of chronic gastritis, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastric adenocarcinoma and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALToma). H. pylori elimination has become the standard therapy to cure peptic ulcer disease. In addition, eradication therapy is also strongly recommended in the treatment of H. pylori -related gastric MALToma. In regions with high incidence of gastric adenocarcinoma, eradication of H. pylori is advocated as a preventative measure for gastric cancer. With the rising prevalence of clarithromycin resistance in H. pylori, the eradication rates of standard triple therapy consisting of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), amoxicillin and clarithromycin infection have declined to less than 80% in most countries. – Recently, several strategies including bismuth-containing, non-bismuth-containing quadruple therapies (including sequential, concomitant, hybrid and reverse hybrid therapies), high-dose dual therapy and vonoprazan-based triple therapy have been proposed to increase the eradication rate of H. pylori infection.

However, the Real-world Practice & Expectation of Asia-Pacific Physicians and Patients in Helicobacter Pylori Eradication (REAP-HP) Survey showed that 7-day standard triple therapy remained the most popular regimen in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition, data from the European Registry on Helicobacter pylori management (Hp-EuReg) also showed that despite the high pretreatment clarithromycin resistance rate of 23% in Europe, the standard triple therapy containing both amoxicillin and clarithromycin remains as the most commonly prescribed (39%) H. pylori infection treatment, achieving only an 81.5% modified intention-to-treat eradication rate.

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to (1) review current first-line eradication regimens with a per-protocol eradication rate exceeding 90% in most geographic area, and (2) identify appropriate empirical H. pylori eradication strategies in regions with high and low clarithromycin resistances.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^111sPPdY]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The aim of any antimicrobial therapy is to reliably cure H. pylori infection in ≥ 90% of patients. A recent network analysis of the effectiveness of multiple first-line treatments worldwide demonstrated that standard triple therapy was the least efficacious regimen analysed. An audit of first-line clarithromycin triple therapy from Tallaght University Hospital over a 3-year period (2019–2021) revealed a suboptimal eradication rate of 82.5% (N = 227/275). As first-line clarithromycin triple therapy should not be used empirically in areas where clarithromycin resistance is known to be > 15%, and local eradication rates fall below the 90% target, clarithromycin AST, either by culture or molecular methods (see statements 5 and 6) is recommended before prescribing any clarithromycin-containing therapy. Only in cases where clarithromycin susceptibility is confirmed should clarithromycin-based triple therapy (Table 3 and Fig. 1) be prescribed. The European Registry on the Management of H. pylori infection (Hp-EuReg) has demonstrated that longer treatment durations and higher dose PPI are associated with increased eradication rates in their analysis of first-line treatment outcomes in 21 533 patients over a 5-year period (2013–2018). Thus, high-dose PPI and treatment durations of 14 days are recommended. While recent studies have demonstrated the potential of the potassium-competitive acid blocker vonoprazan for acid suppression and enhancing H. pylori eradication rates, vonoprazan is currently not available in Ireland.

Concomitant therapy consists of a PPI, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole given twice daily for durations ranging from 5 to 14 days. A meta-analysis of 40 studies comprising 5,810 treatment-naive patients found no significant difference in eradication between BQT and concomitant therapy (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94–1.07), with overall ITT eradication 87.4% (709/904) for BQT and 85.2% (727/906) for concomitant therapy; a low-risk-of-bias subgroup showed BQT 88.2% (682/773) vs concomitant 84.5% (653/773) (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01–1.09, P = 0.02). Adverse events were reported less commonly with concomitant therapy than with BQT (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83–0.99). Given the lack of superiority and stewardship considerations, concomitant therapy is not a suggested option for treatment-naive patients with H. pylori infection in North America.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^114HuxWv]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is recognized as one of the most common chronic bacterial infections worldwide, infecting approximately half of the global population. H. pylori is a World Health Organization (WHO)-designated carcinogen and the strongest known risk factor for noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma, the most prevalent form of gastric cancer. It is also causally linked to peptic ulcer disease. Even though only 1–3% of infected individuals will develop malignant complications, H. pylori accounts for 15% of the total cancer burden globally, with up to 89% of all gastric cancer attributable to H. pylori infection. Accordingly, all major gastroenterological societies recommend that H. pylori be eradicated in individuals who test positive.

Downstream consequences of failed treatment include clinical complications related to persistent H. pylori infection and repeated exposure to antibiotics and high-dose acid suppression, generation of antibiotic resistance in H. pylori and other organisms, as well as the associated direct and indirect costs to the healthcare system. Because the likelihood of successful eradication decreases with each subsequent therapeutic attempt, every effort should be made to address factors that might contribute to eradication failure.

Several guidelines exist to help providers choose regimens to eradicate H. pylori on the first attempt; they also include advice on management after initial treatments fail. However, these guidelines are backed by limited high-quality evidence. In general, they rely heavily on trials conducted in populations that are relatively homogenous within geographic borders, albeit ethnically distinct (e.g. Asian-Pacific populations). In contrast, the United States (US) population comprises individuals with diverse ancestral backgrounds, with correspondingly diverse H. pylori strains. In the US, the lack of recent comparative clinical trials is coupled with limited knowledge of locoregional H. pylori antibiotic resistance patterns and of regimen-specific local cure rates, as well as limited contemporary data on temporal trends and relevant demographic details (e.g. age, race and ethnicity). Current national and international guidelines provide limited guidance on how to approach factors other than H. pylori antibiotic resistance which might also underlie eradication failure, such as host- and systems-related factors. Collectively, these issues contribute to persistent H. pylori infection (Figure 1).

### Efficient identification and evaluation of effective Helicobacter pylori therapies [^113a55Y5]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Annually hundreds if not thousands of patients fail empiric H. pylori eradication therapy. Failure occurs in part because routine post treatment testing, which provides an early warning of increasing antibiotic resistance, is not universally done and physicians are generally unaware that cure rates with legacy triple therapy (a proton-pump inhibitor, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin) in most places has fallen below 80%. We propose first, institution of routine post eradication testing and second, abandonment of the "better than another therapy" approach to separating acceptable from unacceptable therapies. Instead, we propose using results-based outcomes (ie, > 95% cure rates). H. pylori should be evaluated as other infectious diseases (ie, few would compare a new antibiotic for pneumonia with the previous best choice whose effectiveness was now impaired because of resistance). Randomized comparisons should be restricted to studies designed to improve (eg, simplify or reduce costs) high cure rate therapies while maintaining efficacy. We also discuss potential ethical issues such as those including known or suspected low cure rate therapies. Legacy therapies cannot be identified as "approved" or "recommended" even if both statements were true. Instead patients and ethics boards must receive "full disclosures" both before and during studies that include all that might affect a patient's decision to enter or to continue. Finally, we provides advice regarding trial design using "best shot" pilot studies to efficiently identify tentative effective regimens which are then confirmed in randomized trials all the while minimizing patient risks and drug exposure.

### Diagnosis and therapy in the era of antimicrobial stewardship [^1117Bjgo]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Although H. pylori was formally declared an infectious disease in 2015, this change in status has yet to be reflected in treatment recommendations or conduct and analyses of clinical studies. In infectious diseases, antibiotics are never administered to patients known to be resistance to them and additional antibiotics are not added to a therapy with the hope that the infection will be susceptible to at least one of them. Current H. pylori treatment guidelines still deal with H. pylori gastritis as if it were a typical gastroenterology disease such as constipation (i.e. of largely unknown etiology, impossible to cure, treatable but with relative low expectations, and with a high placebo response). This has resulted in a focus on randomized comparative trials where differences in cure rate rather than actual cure rates are considered the most important outcome measure. In reality, most comparative studies compare therapies with the same name (e.g. bismuth quadruple therapy rather than on their actual components) and ignore the differences in details of drug administration that allows factors such as the prevalence of resistance, duration of therapy, and relative potency of the antisecretory drug to greatly influence outcome. An example, in a recent network meta-analysis, the cure rates with most of the clarithromycin triple therapy comparator ranged were clinically unacceptable, ranging from 32% to 92%, with 76% below 85%. Comparative trials also typically do not take antimicrobial resistance or its effects on outcome into account. As such, the results of most clinical trials and meta-analyses fail to provide useful information or to provide material from which to derive meaningful guidance for the management of specific infections in specific patients. As noted above, this problem is a residual of the history of attempting to force an infectious disease into a gastroenterology mold.

The recent rapid increase in the availability of susceptibility testing has taken us the cusp of integrating susceptibility-based H. pylori therapy into our daily practice. We anticipate that practice will rapid evolve to a combination of use of proven locally highly effective empiric therapies and susceptibility-based therapy (Figure 1). The goal of this article is to review the issues involved in the choice of an effective therapy of patients with H. pylori infections and provide specific guidance that will reliably produce high cure rates. We begin with the problem of antimicrobial resistance.

### Helicobacter pylori: factors affecting eradication and recurrence [^114vkqmR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors play an important role in increasing the bioavailability of antibiotics in the gastric mucus by altering gastric volumes and increasing the stability of some antibiotics, e.g., clarithromycin. Increasing the doses of potent proton pump inhibitors has small effects on eradication rates but there may be differences between proton pump inhibitors that need further study.

### High-dose versus standard-dose PPI in triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication [^117VdfqK]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Empiric clarithromycin-containing triple therapies for eradication of Helicobacter pylori do not reliably produce a ≥ 80% success rate on an intention-to-treat basis. This lack of adequate treatment response is primarily because of clarithromycin resistance. This commentary discusses the findings of a meta-analysis by Villoria et al. that investigated whether a triple therapy containing a high-dose PPI and clarithromycin plus either amoxicillin or tinidazole improves the success rate of H. pylori eradication compared with a triple therapy that contains a standard-dose PPI. The mean intention-to-treat cure rates were greater in patients who used the high-dose PPI regimen compared with the standard-dose regimen (82% vs 74%, respectively). However, the actual cure rates of these studies were poor and the improvements were unlikely to be clinically significant. The prevalence of clarithromycin resistance in most of the world is such that clarithromycin-containing triple therapy should not be used empirically. Alternatives include sequential or concomitant therapy and bismuth-containing quadruple therapies.

Helicobacter pylori treatment — dual therapy with a PCAB and amoxicillin is suggested as a first-line treatment option for treatment-naive infection (conditional recommendation; moderate quality evidence). Unlike most proton pump inhibitors, which should be taken 30–60 minutes before a meal for optimal effect, vonoprazan can be taken in the fed or fasted state, and two vonoprazan-based regimens were approved by the FDA in 2022 for the treatment of H. pylori infection in adults. One randomized controlled trial directly compared PCAB–amoxicillin dual therapy comprising vonoprazan 20 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1,000 mg 3 times daily with PPI–clarithromycin triple therapy comprising lansoprazole 30 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, and amoxicillin 1,000 mg each given twice daily, with each regimen for 14 days. In subjects with clarithromycin-sensitive strains, the vonoprazan–amoxicillin dual regimen was noninferior to the lansoprazole–clarithromycin triple regimen, and trial demographics included almost 90% White participants, fewer than half enrolled in the United States, and a mean body mass index around 29 kg/m2.

PRISMA, preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

Table 1 summarizes the per-protocol eradication rates of 7-day and 14-day standard triple therapies for H. pylori infection according to clarithromycin resistance in randomized controlled trials. – In patients treated by 7-day triple standard therapy, the eradication rates of those harboring clarithromycin-susceptible strains and clarithromycin-resistant strains were 92.5% (223/241) and 42.9% (12/28), respectively. According to efficacy prediction model, the expected eradication rate is less than 90% when the frequency of clarithromycin-resistant strains is higher than 5% (Figure 2). In patients treated by 14-day triple standard therapy, the eradication rates of those harboring clarithromycin-susceptible strains and clarithromycin-resistant strains were 90.2% (724/803) and 46.2% (48/104), respectively. The expected eradication rate is less than 90% when the frequency of clarithromycin-resistant strains is higher than 4% (Figure 2). The data indicate that per-protocol eradication rates of 7-day and 14-day standard triple therapies fall below 90% if clarithromycin resistance rate is > 5%. Therefore, health providers must adopt more efficacious anti- H. pylori regimens to meet the recommendation of consensus recommendation and patients' expectation when community clarithromycin resistance rate for H. pylori is greater than 5%. Most consensuses recommend that only regimens which reliably produce eradication rates of ⩾90% in that population should be used for empirical treatment, and use 15% as a breakpoint of using standard triple therapy. In fact, the eradication rates of 7-day and 14-day standard triple therapies fall below 90% in areas with 5–15% clarithromycin resistance.

### Helicobacter pylori treatment in the era of increasing antibiotic resistance [^116ULtio]. Gut (2010). Low credibility.

With few exceptions, the most commonly recommended triple Helicobacter pylori regimen (proton pump inhibitor (PPI), amoxicillin and clarithromycin) now provides unacceptably low treatment success. A review of worldwide results suggests that successful eradication using a triple regimen is not consistently observed in any population. Clinicians should use 'only use what works locally' and ignore consensus statements and society guidelines if they are not consistent with local results. Clinical trials should be result based, with the goal of identifying regimens with > 90–95% success. New treatments should be only be compared with the currently locally effective treatment (> 90%) or a historical untreated control (which has been shown to reliably yield 0% eradication); trials using placebos or treatments known to be inferior are with rare exceptions unethical. If a highly effective regimen is not available locally, we recommend trying a 14 day concomitant quadruple treatment regimen containing a PPI, amoxicillin, clarithromycin and a nitroimidazole; 10 day sequential treatment (PPI plus amoxicillin for 5 days followed by a PPI, clarithromycin and a nitroimidazole for 5 days); or 14 day bismuth-containing quadruple treatments. Treatments needing further evaluation include those containing furazolidone or nitazoxanide, hybrids of sequential-concomitant therapies and amoxicillin-PPI dual therapy with PPI doses such that they maintain intragastric pH > 6.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^111Y5Gb5]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Best Practice Advice 1–4 for refractory Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection emphasize that the usual cause is antibiotic resistance and that providers should assess for other contributors including adherence and acid suppression. Providers should conduct a thorough review of prior antibiotic exposures and avoid clarithromycin- or levofloxacin-based regimens if there is prior macrolide or fluoroquinolone use, whereas resistance to amoxicillin, tetracycline, and rifabutin is rare and these can be considered. Education and adherence support are advised by explaining the rationale for therapy, dosing instructions, expected adverse events, and the importance of completing the full course. If bismuth quadruple therapy failed as a first-line treatment, shared decision making should guide selection between levofloxacin- or rifabutin-based triple therapy with high-dose dual proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and amoxicillin, or an alternative bismuth-containing quadruple therapy as second-line options.

### High-dose dual therapyculture-based susceptibility-guided therapy as a rescue regimen forinfection: a randomized controlled trial [^111HEmN4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Although the Maastricht VI/Florence consensus report recommended high-dose proton pump inhibitor-amoxicillin dual therapy as possible rescue therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection, clinical evidence of its efficacy was lacking.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy, safety, patient compliance, and cost between high-dose dual therapy (HDDT) and culture-based susceptibility-guided therapy (CB-SGT) as a rescue regimen for H. pylori infection.

Design

A single-center, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial.

Methods

In all, 146 patients with a history of eradication failure were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive HDDT or CB-SGT. HDDT consisted of esomeprazole 20mg and amoxicillin 750mg, both given four times per day (qid). CB-SGT consisted of esomeprazole 20mg twice daily (bid), amoxicillin 1000mg bid plus clarithromycin 500mg bid, metronidazole 400mg bid, or levofloxacin 500mg daily (qd) for sensitive patients, in that order. For patients with triple resistance, a bismuth-containing regimen with a high dose of metronidazole was chosen, including esomeprazole 20mg bid, bismuth 220mg bid, amoxicillin 1000mg bid, and metronidazole 400mg qid. All regimens were given for 14days.

Results

The eradication H. pylori rates achieved with HDDT in the intention-to-treat (ITT), per-protocol, and modified ITT analyses were all 84.9% [62/73, 95% confidence interval (CI): 76.5–93.9%], compared with 83.6% (61/73, 95% CI: 74.9–92.3%), 84.7% (61/72, 95% CI: 76.2–93.2%), and 84.7% (61/72, 95% CI: 76.2–93.2%) with CB-SGT, respectively. For patients with CYP2C19 polymorphisms of intermediate/poor metabolizers, the eradication rates of HDDT and CB-SGT were 90.70% (39/43, 95% CI: 77.86–97.41%) and 84.21% (32/38, 95% CI: 68.75–93.98%), respectively. The difference between groups was 6.49% (95% CI: -8.00% to 20.97%), and the non-inferiority p value was 0.0128. For patients with a treatment interval of more than 3months, the eradication rates of the two regimens reached 88.71% (95% CI: 78.11–95.34%) and 71.97% (95% CI: 70.02–90.64%). The difference between groups was 6.74% (95% CI: -5.71% to 19.20%), with a non-inferiority p value of 0.0042. Patient adherence was high in both groups. The HDDT had a lower cost and rate of side effects (p < 0.001) compared with CB-SGT.

Conclusions

HDDT can reach an eradication rate of 85% in treatment-experienced patients of H. pylori infection and 91% in patients with CYP2C19 polymorphisms of intermediate/poor metabolizers, with good compliance, lower side effects and costs, and less use of antibiotics. In conclusion, HDDT offers an effective rescue regimen for H. pylori infection.

Registration

This clinical trial was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trail Registry (trail registration number: ChiCTR1900025044).

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^113UgsGE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Helicobacter pylori is a prevalent, global infectious disease that causes dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric cancer. The American College of Gastroenterology commissioned this clinical practice guideline (CPG) to inform the evidence-based management of patients with H. pylori infection in North America. This CPG used Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to systematically analyze 11 Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome questions and generate recommendations. Where evidence was insufficient or the topic did not lend itself to GRADE, expert consensus was used to create 6 key concepts. For treatment-naive patients with H. pylori infection, bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT) for 14 days is the preferred regimen when antibiotic susceptibility is unknown. Rifabutin triple therapy or potassium-competitive acid blocker dual therapy for 14 days is a suitable empiric alternative in patients without penicillin allergy. In treatment-experienced patients with persistent H. pylori infection, "optimized" BQT for 14 days is preferred for those who have not been treated with optimized BQT previously and for whom antibiotic susceptibility is unknown. In patients previously treated with optimized BQT, rifabutin triple therapy for 14 days is a suitable empiric alternative. Salvage regimens containing clarithromycin or levofloxacin should only be used if antibiotic susceptibility is confirmed. The CPG also addresses who to test, the need for universal post-treatment test-of-cure, and the current evidence regarding antibiotic susceptibility testing and its role in guiding the choice of initial and salvage treatment. The CPG concludes with a discussion of proposed research priorities to address knowledge gaps and inform future management recommendations in patients with H. pylori infection from North America.

### Update on the first-line treatment ofinfection in areas with high and low clarithromycin resistances [^114M7n5p]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Current international consensuses on Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy recommend that only regimens that reliably produce eradication rates of ⩾90% should be used for empirical treatment. The Real-world Practice & Expectation of Asia-Pacific Physicians and Patients in Helicobacter Pylori Eradication Survey also showed that the accepted minimal eradication rate in H. pylori -infected patients was 91%. According to efficacy prediction model, the per-protocol eradication rates of 7-day and 14-day standard triple therapies fall below 90% when clarithromycin resistance rate ⩾5%. Several strategies including bismuth-containing, non-bismuth-containing quadruple therapies (including sequential, concomitant, hybrid and reverse hybrid therapies), high-dose dual therapy and vonoprazan-based triple therapy have been proposed to increase the eradication rate of H. pylori infection. According to efficacy prediction model, the eradication rate of 14-day concomitant therapy, 14-day hybrid therapy and 7-day vonoprazan-based triple therapy is less than 90% if the frequency of clarithromycin-resistant strains is higher than 90%, 58% and 23%, respectively. To meet the recommendation of the consensus report and patients' expectation, local surveillance networks for resistance of H. pylori to clarithromycin are required to select appropriate eradication regimens in each geographic region. In areas with low (< 5%) clarithromycin resistance (e.g. Sweden, Philippine, Myanmar and Bhutan), 7-day and 14-day standard triple therapies can be adopted for the first-line treatment of H. pylori infection with eradication rates of ⩾90%. In areas with high (⩾5%) clarithromycin resistance (most other countries worldwide) or unknown clarithromycin resistance, 14-day hybrid, 14-day reverse hybrid, 14-day concomitant and 10- to 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy can be used to treat H. pylori infection.

### The toronto consensus for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adults [^1114UCd6]. Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Helicobacter pylori infection is increasingly difficult to treat. The purpose of these consensus statements is to provide a review of the literature and specific, updated recommendations for eradication therapy in adults.

Methods

A systematic literature search identified studies on H pylori treatment. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Statements were developed through an online platform, finalized, and voted on by an international working group of specialists chosen by the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology.

Results

Because of increasing failure of therapy, the consensus group strongly recommends that all H pylori eradication regimens now be given for 14 days. Recommended first-line strategies include concomitant nonbismuth quadruple therapy (proton pump inhibitor [PPI] + amoxicillin + metronidazole + clarithromycin [PAMC]) and traditional bismuth quadruple therapy (PPI + bismuth + metronidazole + tetracycline [PBMT]). PPI triple therapy (PPI + clarithromycin + either amoxicillin or metronidazole) is restricted to areas with known low clarithromycin resistance or high eradication success with these regimens. Recommended rescue therapies include PBMT and levofloxacin-containing therapy (PPI + amoxicillin + levofloxacin). Rifabutin regimens should be restricted to patients who have failed to respond to at least 3 prior options.

Conclusions

Optimal treatment of H pylori infection requires careful attention to local antibiotic resistance and eradication patterns. The quadruple therapies PAMC or PBMT should play a more prominent role in eradication of H pylori infection, and all treatments should be given for 14 days.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^1157Gs8F]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori salvage after prior PPI-clarithromycin triple therapy — optimized BQT suggestion: In treatment-experienced patients with persistent H. pylori infection who have previously received PPI-clarithromycin triple therapy, optimized BQT is suggested (conditional recommendation; low quality of evidence). In one study, 43 individuals with persistent infection after one prior eradication course were randomized to 14-day BQT (lansoprazole 30 mg, bismuth 2 tablets [dose not provided], metronidazole 250 mg, and tetracycline 250 mg, all given 4 times daily) or PPI-clarithromycin triple therapy (lansoprazole 30 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, and clarithromycin 500 mg, all given twice daily), and there was no statistically significant difference in eradication success rates between PPI-clarithromycin triple therapy and BQT. Considering drug factors including tetracycline cost and frequent side effects, the guideline committee still prefers optimized BQT over clarithromycin- or levofloxacin-containing salvage regimens, unless susceptibility to these antibiotics is demonstrated; a core principle is to avoid clarithromycin and levofloxacin in individuals with any prior exposure to, respectively, macrolides or fluoroquinolones, yet U.S. claims data showed more than 50% receiving a repeat course of PPI-clarithromycin triple therapy despite the lack of antibiotic susceptibility testing in the interval.

### Impact of previous exposure to macrolide antibiotics on Helicobacter pylori infection treatment outcomes [^113i3MW3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) guidelines, including the recent ACG clinical guideline, recommend avoiding clarithromycin-based triple therapy (TT-C) among patients with past macrolide exposure. Data to support this recommendation are scarce, and the impact of macrolide exposure on quadruple therapies is unclear. We aimed to determine the impact of macrolide exposure on the efficacy of H. pylori treatment in our region.

Methods

We searched the Clalit Health Services database to identify subjects aged 25–60 years who underwent the first-ever C-urea breath test between 2010 and 2015. Patients who underwent a previous H. pylori stool antigen test or gastroscopy were excluded. Pharmacy dispensation data were retrieved.

Results

We identified 7,842 subjects (36.1% male individuals, age: 40.3 ± 10.5 years), including 3,062 (39.0%) with previous macrolide exposure. The efficacy of TT-C was 74.3% and 82.4% among subjects with and without macrolide exposure, respectively (odds ratio (OR), 0.62; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.55–0.70; P < 0.0001). TT success was adversely affected by exposure to clarithromycin (55.5%; OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.24–0.39; P < 0.0001), roxythromycin (74.4%; OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.58–0.74; P < 0.0001), and erythromycin (73.9%; OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57–0.89; P < 0.01) but not by exposure to azithromycin. A greater time elapsed because exposure to clarithromycin and roxythromycin was associated with higher eradication (OR, 1.007; 95% CI, 1.002–1.012; P < 0.01 and OR, 1.004; 95% CI, 1.002–1.006; P < 0.0001). A higher dose of clarithromycin and roxythromycin was associated with a lower likelihood of successful eradication (OR, 0.99988; 95% CI, 0.99982–0.99996; P < 0.01 and OR, 0.99981; 95% CI, 0.99971–0.99992; P < 0.001). The efficacies of sequential and concomitant therapies were 82.7% and 81.3%, respectively, and were not significantly affected by macrolide exposure.

Conclusions

TT-C is adversely affected by previous exposure to macrolide antibiotics. Sequential, concomitant, and bismuth-based treatment may be preferred in this setting.

### Eradication of H. pylori infection: the challenge is on if standard therapy fails [^114j8WPf]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

The recommended standard triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection, consisting of a proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin and amoxicillin or metronidazole, can reach eradication rates in over 90%. However, in recent years resistance to antibiotics has increased and eradication rates have declined. Approximately one in five patients need a second-line therapy because eradication therapy fails. Second-line treatment with a bismuth-based quadruple therapy leads to satisfactory eradication rates, but bismuth is not available in many countries. Modern second- and third-line treatments can only be successful if they are adapted to the current resistance situation and they need to evolve continuously. Moreover, pharmacodynamic effects due to polymorphisms of the cytochrome P450 system are important. Because therapy adherence is significantly associated with therapy success, modern regimens if possible should be easy to take and well tolerated. In recent years, various novel salvage-therapy regimens have been investigated that significantly improve treatment options.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^112LY2W7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection — guideline recommendations for treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients are as follows: In treatment-naive patients with H. pylori infection, optimized bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT) is recommended as a first-line treatment option (strong recommendation; moderate quality of evidence), rifabutin triple therapy is suggested as a first-line treatment option (conditional recommendation; low quality of evidence), dual therapy with a potassium-competitive acid blocker (PCAB) and amoxicillin is suggested as a first-line treatment option (conditional recommendation; moderate quality evidence), and for unknown clarithromycin susceptibility, PCAB-clarithromycin triple therapy is suggested over proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-clarithromycin triple therapy (conditional recommendation; moderate quality evidence), while concomitant therapy is not suggested over bismuth quadruple therapy (conditional recommendation; low quality evidence). For treatment-experienced patients with persistent H. pylori infection, optimized bismuth quadruple therapy is suggested in those who have not previously received bismuth quadruple therapy (conditional recommendation; very low quality of evidence), optimized bismuth quadruple therapy is suggested after prior PPI-clarithromycin triple therapy (conditional recommendation; low quality of evidence), rifabutin triple therapy is suggested after receipt of bismuth quadruple therapy (conditional recommendation; low quality of evidence), optimized bismuth quadruple therapy is suggested over quinolone-based therapy when optimized bismuth quadruple therapy has not been previously received (conditional recommendation; low quality of evidence), and levofloxacin triple therapy is suggested in patients with known levofloxacin-sensitive H. pylori strains and when optimized bismuth quadruple or rifabutin triple therapies have previously been used or are unavailable (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). In treatment-experienced patients with persistent H. pylori infection, there is insufficient evidence from North America to recommend high-dose PPI or PCAB dual therapy (no recommendation; evidence gap), and there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the use of probiotic therapy improves the efficacy or tolerability of H. pylori eradication therapy (conditional recommendation; low quality of evidence).

### Reconciliation of recent Helicobacter pylori treatment guidelines in a time of increasing resistance to antibiotics [^115e74Cq]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Increasing resistance to antibiotics worldwide has adverse effects on the effectiveness of standard therapies to eradicate Helicobacter pylori infection. We reviewed guidelines developed by expert groups in Europe, Canada, and the United States for the treatment of H pylori infection. We compared the recommendations of these guidelines, reconciled them, and addressed the increasing resistance of H pylori to antibiotic therapy regimens. The guidelines recommend bismuth quadruple therapy for first-line treatment, replacing clarithromycin-based triple therapy. There is consensus for concomitant 4-drug therapy as an alternative, especially when bismuth is not available. When therapy is unsuccessful, it is likely due to resistance to clarithromycin, levofloxacin, and/or metronidazole; these drugs, if used previously, should be avoided in subsequent eradication attempts. Second-line therapies should be bismuth quadruple therapy or levofloxacin triple therapy, depending on suspected resistance, reserving rifabutin-based triple and high-dose dual amoxicillin proton pump inhibitor therapy for subsequent treatment attempts. The increasing resistance of H pylori to antibiotic therapy necessitates local availability of susceptibility tests for individuals, and establishment of regional and national monitoring programs to develop evidence-based locally relevant eradication strategies. Further studies into the development of more easily accessible methods of resistance testing, such as biomarker analysis of stool samples, are required. Options under investigation include substituting vonoprazan for proton pump inhibitors, adding probiotics, and vaccine development. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics and new therapeutic targets could be identified based on genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses of H pylori.

Regarding medical management for Helicobacter pylori infection, more specifically with respect to first-line regimens, AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend to administer bismuth quadruple therapy (PPI, bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole or tinidazole) or concomitant therapy (non-bismuth quadruple therapy; PPI, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole or tinidazole) as first-line therapy in patients with H. pylori infection.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^112Ruq3K]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori treatment — key concepts emphasize prevalence, linked testing-treatment decisions, regimen selection, and follow-up. The prevalence of H. pylori infection in North America remains substantial at 30%–40%. The determination of when to test for — and treat — H. pylori should be viewed as a single, rather than 2 separate and distinct, decisions. Clarithromycin- and levofloxacin-containing treatment regimens should be avoided in the absence of demonstrated macrolide and quinolone susceptibility, respectively. All patients who are treated for H. pylori infection should undergo a test of cure with an appropriately conducted urea breath test, fecal antigen test, or biopsy-based test at least 4 wk after completion of therapy. In treatment-experienced patients with persistent H. pylori infection that is confirmed to be clarithromycin-sensitive, PPI- or PCAB-clarithromycin triple therapy is suggested. Based on expert consensus, we advise using antibiotic susceptibility testing whenever the choice of therapy remains unclear after taking into consideration any previous treatments for H. pylori infection, past antibiotic exposure more generally, and whether there is a documented history of penicillin allergy. PCAB denotes potassium-competitive acid blocker and PPI denotes proton pump inhibitor.

Helicobacter pylori — clarithromycin and levofloxacin resistance and empiric use: In the United States, resistance rates are currently 20%–30% for clarithromycin and approach 40% for levofloxacin, translating to predicted eradication success rates of 70% or less when used empirically in triple regimens; with known clarithromycin resistance, standard PPI-clarithromycin triple therapy achieves eradication in fewer than a third of patients; it is no longer appropriate to use clarithromycin- or levofloxacin-containing regimens empirically, and the key concept states these regimens "should be avoided" without demonstrated susceptibility, although they remain options for selected patients with confirmed susceptible strains.

Table 1. GRADE criteria — strength of recommendation and quality of evidence definitions are specified as follows: Strong recommendations are offered when the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects, whereas conditional recommendations are offered when trade-offs are less certain — either because of low quality evidence or because evidence suggests that desirable and undesirable effects are closely balanced; quality of evidence is graded as high ("We are very confident that the true effect closely aligns with that of the estimate of the effect".), moderate ("We have a moderate level of confidence in the estimate of effect. It is likely that the true effect is close to the estimate of the effect".), low ("Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. The true effect could differ from the estimate of effect".), or very low ("We have very little confidence in the effect estimate.

### H. pylori infection: ACG updates treatment recommendations… [^116SiDUP]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

RECOMMENDED Clarithromycin triple therapy consists of a PPI, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin or metronidazole for 14 days. The effect of H. pylori resistance to clarithromycin is well documented. Clarithromycin should be avoided in locations where resistance is greater than 15% and in patients with any previous macrolide exposure. Limited data show that the effects of clarithromycin resistance with this regimen are less than with clarithromycin triple therapy. A duration of 10 to 14 days seems appropriate, although studies to assess whether extending therapy to 14 days improves eradication are ongoing. SUGGESTED Sequential therapy consists of a PPI and amoxicillin for five to seven days followed by a PPI, clarithromycin, and a nitroimidazole for five to seven days.

Although 10 days of sequential therapy appears to be a viable alternative to 14 days of clarithromycin triple therapy, 10 days of sequential therapy has not been shown to be superior to 14 days of clarithromycin triple therapy. Extending sequential therapy to 14 days may improve eradication rates, but more studies are needed. The complexity of sequential therapy may limit its use. The best options appear to be fluoroquinolone-containing sequential therapy or LOAD therapy. Bismuth quadruple therapy for 14 days or levofloxacin triple therapy for 14 days are the recommended salvage regimens.

Other suggested regimens include concomitant therapy for 10 to 14 days, rifabutin triple therapy for 10 days, and high-dose dual therapy for 14 days. Clarithromycin triple therapy is not recommended for salvage therapy.

### Best treatment approach: should a national consensus be the best consensus? [^114F7fTP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

A significant number of national and international consensuses have been published in the literature during recent years concerning the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). These guidelines are aimed toward achieving an extremely high cure rate (≥ 90%), which seems to be unachievable in real-world settings, especially in areas with high clarithromycin resistance, such as southern Europe. Times change quickly and, as with other infectious diseases, we are moving inevitably from a trial-and-error therapeutic approach to a susceptibility-based one. Empirical first-line treatments should be based on what works best in each geographical and/or national area and must take into account the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in each region.

We have reviewed the basic conclusive suggestions from the existing guidelines and consensuses worldwide concerning the best anti- H. pylori treatment approach in relation to antibiotic resistance (Table 1). According to this global plethora of recommendations, it is worth remembering that the determinants of a successful H. pylori eradication could be divided into host-related (e.g. previous antibiotic exposure, patient's adherence to a multi-drug regimen and/or genetic factors) and H. pylori -related factors, with antibiotic sensitivity appearing to be the most important and consistent predictor of success, both in clinical trials and in population-based studies of H. pylori eradication. Thus, it is of major importance for a country's clinical practitioners to know the local pattern of resistance. It seems apparent that an international consensus should play a major role in a specialist's decision making, but it also appears quite reasonable and inevitable that a national consensus, based on nationwide surveys of first-line, second-line and rescue therapies, as well as the local prevalence of antibiotic resistance, should play the major role in each clinician's judgment. In a recently published review, De Francesco et al provided a critical reappraisal of updated worldwide guidelines. The authors fairly concluded that, although several of these guidelines highlighted that the results being achieved by an eradication therapy are population-specific and not directly transferable to another one, it emerged that some therapeutic regimens are recommended or discouraged with no mention of the need to consult existing national data. However, if solid susceptibility data are available for a specific population, then one could recommend or reject various therapeutic regimens for this population, because antimicrobial resistance seems to represent the key factor adversely affecting the outcome of eradication treatment. Nevertheless, each national study group and consensus panel should avoid taking isolated data from one study in a specific region of the country and arbitrarily generalizing them to the entire country's population. On the other hand, this extrapolation seems to be generally accepted for one country if its susceptibility pattern has been thoroughly defined.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^113WozFR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

High-dose dual therapy (HDDT) for Helicobacter pylori — evidence gap and limited data: In treatment-experienced patients with persistent H. pylori infection, there is insufficient evidence from North America to recommend high-dose PPI or PCAB dual therapy (no recommendation; evidence gap). HDDT consists of potent gastric acid suppression therapy (e.g., high-dose proton pump inhibitor [PPI] or potassium-competitive acid blocker [PCAB]) and high-dose amoxicillin, preferably for 14 days, but the data regarding its efficacy as a salvage regimen are very limited, with no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from North America. The only study from a Western population is a small noninferiority RCT from Germany published in 2003, in which 84 patients with at least 1 previous H. pylori treatment failure and a confirmed infection were randomized.

ACG clinical guideline — Summary of recommendations for treatment-naive patients: For treatment-naive patients with Helicobacter pylori infection, BQT (preferably optimized — as discussed below) for 14 days is the preferred option when the antimicrobial susceptibility profile is unknown. Rifabutin triple therapy or PCAB dual therapy for 14 days are suitable alternatives as empiric therapy in patients without penicillin allergy. In patients with unknown antibiotic susceptibility and no history of macrolide exposure or penicillin allergy, PCAB-clarithromycin triple therapy for 14 days is preferred over PPI-clarithromycin triple therapy when no other obvious first-line treatment option is available.

### Empiric quadruple vs. triple therapy for primary treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection: systematic review and meta-analysis of efficacy and tolerability [^115bTJFm]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Recent treatment guidelines recommend two first-line therapies for Helicobacter pylori infection: proton pump inhibitor (PPI), bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole (quadruple therapy) or PPI, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin (triple therapy). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and tolerability of these regimens as first-line treatment of H. pylori.

Methods

A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ACP Journal Club, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness, Cochrane Methodology Register, Health Technology Assessment Database, and abstracts from prominent gastrointestinal scientific meetings was carried out. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing bismuth quadruple therapy to clarithromycin triple therapy were selected for meta-analysis. Two independent reviewers extracted data, using standardized data forms. Meta-analysis was carried out with the metan command in Stata 10.1. Funnel plots and subgroup analyses were carried out.

Results

Nine RCTs (N = 1,679) were included. Although dosing regimens of clarithromycin triple therapy were quite consistent between trials, dosing regimens varied considerably for bismuth quadruple therapy. Bismuth quadruple therapy achieved eradication in 78.3% of patients, whereas clarithromycin triple therapy achieved an eradication rate of 77.0% (risk ratio (RR) = 1.002, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.936–1.073). There was moderate heterogeneity and no evidence for significant publication bias. Subgroup analyses by study location, treatment duration, and study population did not account for the heterogeneity. There were no statistically significant differences in side effects yielded by quadruple vs. clarithromycin triple therapy (RR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.04–1.14).

Conclusions

Quadruple and triple therapies yielded similar eradication rates as primary therapy for H. pylori infection. Both therapies yielded suboptimal eradication rates. Patient compliance and side effects are similar for quadruple and triple therapies.

### High-dose dual therapy is superior to standard first-line or rescue therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection [^11555XqZ]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The efficacy of treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection has decreased steadily because of increasing resistance to clarithromycin, metronidazole, and levofloxacin. Resistance to amoxicillin is generally low, and high intragastric pH increases the efficacy of amoxicillin, so we investigated whether a combination of a high-dose proton pump inhibitor and amoxicillin (dual therapy) was more effective than standard first-line or rescue therapies in eradicating H pylori.

Methods

We performed a large-scale multihospital trial to compare the efficacy of a high-dose dual therapy (HDDT) with that of standard therapies in treatment-naive (n = 450) or treatment-experienced (n = 168) patients with H pylori infection. Treatment-naive patients were randomly assigned to groups given HDDT (rabeprazole 20 mg and amoxicillin 750 mg, 4 times/day for 14 days, group A1), sequential therapy for 10 days (group B1), or clarithromycin-containing triple therapy for 7 days (group C1). Treatment-experienced patients were randomly assigned to groups given HDDT for 14 days (group A2), sequential therapy for 10 days (B2), or levofloxacin-containing triple therapy for 7 days (C2). H pylori infection was detected by using the (13)C-urea breath test. We evaluated factors associated with treatment outcomes.

Results

In the intention-to-treat analysis, H pylori was eradicated in 95.3% of patients in group A1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 91.9%-98.8%), 85.3% in B1 (95% CI, 79.6%-91.1%), and 80.7% in group C1 (95% CI, 74.3%-87.1%). Infection was eradicated in 89.3% of patients in group A2 (95% CI, 80.9%-97.6%), 51.8% in group B2 (95% CI, 38.3%-65.3%), and 78.6% (95% CI, 67.5%-89.7%) in group C2. The efficacy of HDDT was significantly higher than that of currently recommended regimens, irrespective of CYP2C19 genotype. Bacterial resistance to drugs was associated with treatment failure. There were no significant differences between groups in adverse events or patient adherence.

Conclusions

HDDT is superior to standard regimens as empirical first-line or rescue therapy for H pylori infection, with similar safety profiles and tolerability. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01163435.

H pylori in children — summary recommendations: Treatment for Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) in children is focused only when it is clinically indicated, or when following discussion with parents is deemed appropriate to treat an incidental finding, with therapy planned to achieve an initial eradication success rate of 90% and higher using higher doses and treatment durations of 10 to 14 days. Clarithromycin-containing regimens should be restricted to those infected with clarithromycin-susceptible strains, and when antibiotic susceptibility profiles are not known high-dose triple therapy with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), amoxicillin, and metronidazole for 14 days is recommended as first-line therapy; bismuth-based quadruple therapy can also be considered for first-line therapy where licensed for children. Testing for cure should be performed with either the 13C-UBT or a fecal antigen test at least 4 weeks after therapy, and the importance of adherence for optimal successful eradication should be emphasized to the parents and child.
