## Question

An infant with fever, cough, and hypoxia has chest radiograph findings consistent with viral pneumonia, and a nasopharyngeal PCR is positive for human parainfluenza virus. The diagnosis is parainfluenza virus pneumonia. What ICD-10 code should be used for billing?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing when an infant has parainfluenza virus pneumonia confirmed by PCR. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether there is a specific ICD-10-CM code for parainfluenza pneumonia. Then, I should verify the correct code and its exact wording. Next, I will consider whether to add a secondary code for hypoxia and how to handle the viral etiology. Finally, I should double-check coding conventions for infants and ensure the documentation supports the code choice, including any needed laterality or severity details.

> Let me first confirm whether a specific ICD-10-CM code exists for parainfluenza pneumonia. I need to check the viral pneumonia section and look for a code that explicitly names parainfluenza. Yes, ICD-10-CM includes J12.2 for "Parainfluenzavirus pneumonia", which is the most specific code for this condition and should be used when parainfluenza is documented as the cause of pneumonia [^1aaf4c2c].

> Wait, let me verify the exact code wording and category to avoid a mistake. The code is J12.2, located in the J12 category for viral pneumonia, not elsewhere classified, and it specifically denotes pneumonia due to parainfluenza virus, which matches the scenario of a PCR-confirmed parainfluenza pneumonia in an infant [^1aaf4c2c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about adding hypoxia as a separate diagnosis. I initially thought to add R06.02 for shortness of breath, but I should confirm whether hypoxia is already captured by the pneumonia code and whether an additional symptom code adds clinical value. Given that viral pneumonia inherently accounts for respiratory compromise, and unless the hypoxia is being specifically managed or is the principal reason for a procedure, adding R06.02 is optional and may be redundant; if documented and clinically relevant, it can be added as a secondary code, but it is not required for billing accuracy in this case [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I am not overcomplicating the viral etiology. The J12.2 code already specifies parainfluenza as the cause, so I should not add a separate B97.x code for the virus; B97.x codes are used when the viral agent is not already named in the pneumonia code, which is not the case here with J12.2 [^notfound].

> Let me consider age-specific coding conventions. For infants, the same ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes apply; there is no infant-specific variant of J12.2, so J12.2 remains appropriate for a neonate or infant with parainfluenza pneumonia, with documentation supporting the diagnosis and, if needed, the age in the record [^notfound].

> I should double-check that the documentation supports the code. The note should explicitly state "parainfluenza pneumonia" or "pneumonia due to parainfluenza virus" and reference the positive PCR result; this aligns with best practices for diagnostic coding and supports medical necessity for the specific J12.2 code rather than a nonspecific viral pneumonia code [^d06e16db].

> Final answer: Use J12.2 as the primary diagnosis code for parainfluenza virus pneumonia. Add R06.02 for hypoxia only if it is clinically significant, separately documented, and necessary for care tracking or billing purposes, recognizing it is optional in this context [^1aaf4c2c].

---

The correct ICD-10-CM code for parainfluenza virus pneumonia in an infant is **J12.2** (Parainfluenzavirus pneumonia) [^1aaf4c2c]. This code should be used when parainfluenza is confirmed by PCR, as it is the most specific available option. If hypoxia is clinically significant, add **R09.02** (hypoxemia) as a secondary diagnosis. Do not use B97.89 (other viral agents) for parainfluenza, as it is not the appropriate code for this pathogen [^notfound].

---

## ICD-10-CM code for parainfluenza virus pneumonia

The most specific ICD-10-CM code for parainfluenza virus pneumonia is **J12.2** (Parainfluenzavirus pneumonia) [^1aaf4c2c]. This code is used when parainfluenza is confirmed as the causative agent, typically by PCR, and is the preferred code for billing and documentation purposes.

---

## Additional ICD-10-CM codes for associated conditions

In addition to the primary diagnosis code, it may be appropriate to include secondary diagnosis codes to capture associated conditions or complications. For example, if the infant presents with hypoxia, the code **R09.02** (hypoxemia) can be added as a secondary diagnosis. Other potential secondary codes may include:

- **R06.02**: Shortness of breath
- **R50.9**: Fever, unspecified
- **R05**: Cough

---

## ICD-10-CM codes to avoid

It is important to avoid using incorrect or nonspecific codes. For example, **B97.89** (other viral agents) should not be used for parainfluenza virus pneumonia, as it is not specific to parainfluenza and may lead to confusion or incorrect billing.

---

## Clinical documentation requirements

Accurate coding relies on thorough clinical documentation. The following elements should be clearly documented in the medical record to support the use of the J12.2 code:

- Confirmation of parainfluenza virus infection by PCR or other laboratory testing
- Clinical presentation, including fever, cough, and hypoxia
- Chest radiograph findings consistent with viral pneumonia
- Any associated complications or comorbidities

---

## Conclusion

The correct ICD-10-CM code for parainfluenza virus pneumonia in an infant is **J12.2** (Parainfluenzavirus pneumonia) [^1aaf4c2c]. Additional codes may be used to capture associated conditions, but it is important to avoid nonspecific codes such as B97.89. Accurate clinical documentation is essential to support the chosen diagnosis codes and ensure appropriate billing and reimbursement.

Discussion

In this cross-sectional diagnostic study of more than 160 000 patients undergoing culture or antigen testing for pneumonia infection in 178 US hospitals, we found that just 35 759 (22.1%) had an identified pathogen. ICD-9 -coded organisms and laboratory findings differed notably. Although specificities and NPVs exceeded 95% for all codes, sensitivities ranged from 95.9% for influenza virus to 14.0% for parainfluenza virus, and PPVs were as high as 91.1% (95% CI, 89.5%-92.6%) for S aureus and as low as 57.1% (95% CI, 39.4%-73.7%) for parainfluenza virus. Because of the high specificities, for most diagnoses an ICD-9 code was a reliable marker of a positive culture, but because of the low sensitivities, use of only administrative codes may potentially undercount almost all diagnoses.

Previous studies have examined the concordance between administrative and clinical data in various infectious syndromes, including pneumonia. Guevara and colleaguesreported sensitivity of 58.3% for the pneumococcal pneumonia code (481.0), similar to what we observed. Schweizer et alquestioned the validity of the ICD-9 code for identifying incident MRSA infection ([V09] not limited to pneumonia), and found sensitivity of 24% with a PPV of 31%, lower than our findings but using a different coding approach. In a study focused on multidrug-resistant organisms, Burnham and colleaguesfound that a higher rate of coding for MRSA was associated with infectious disease consultation, and counseled against using that ICD-9 code to estimate rates of multidrug-resistant organism infection in hospitals. The present study expands on this body of validation work by increasing the pool of common pneumonia pathogens beyond S pneumoniae and MRSA.

Importance

Administrative databases may offer efficient clinical data collection for studying epidemiology, outcomes, and temporal trends in health care delivery. However, such data have seldom been validated against microbiological laboratory results.

Objective

To assess the validity of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) organism-specific administrative codes for pneumonia using microbiological data (test results for blood or respiratory culture, urinary antigen, or polymerase chain reaction) as the criterion standard.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study conducted between February 2017 and June 2019 using data from 178 US hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database. Patients were aged 18 years or older admitted with pneumonia and discharged between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2015. Data were analyzed from February 14, 2017, to June 27, 2019.

Exposures

Organism-specific pneumonia identified from ICD-9 codes.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of ICD-9 codes using microbiological data as the criterion standard.

Results

Of 161 529 patients meeting inclusion criteria (mean [SD] age, 69.5 [16.2] years; 51.2% women), 35 759 (22.1%) had an identified pathogen. ICD-9-coded organisms and laboratory findings differed notably: for example, ICD-9 codes identified only 14.2% and 17.3% of patients with laboratory-detected methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, respectively. Although specificities and negative predictive values exceeded 95% for all codes, sensitivities ranged downward from 95.9% (95% CI, 95.3%-96.5%) for influenza virus to 14.0% (95% CI, 8.8%-20.8%) for parainfluenza virus, and positive predictive values ranged downward from 91.1% (95% CI, 89.5%-92.6%) for Staphylococcus aureus to 57.1% (95% CI, 39.4%-73.7%) for parainfluenza virus.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, ICD-9 codes did not reliably capture pneumonia etiology identified by laboratory testing; because of the high specificities of ICD-9 codes, however, administrative data may be useful in identifying risk factors for resistant organisms. The low sensitivities of the diagnosis codes may limit the validity of organism-specific pneumonia prevalence estimates derived from administrative data.

Table 2.
Cross-Classification of Laboratory Findings by ICD-9 Diagnosis Code for 12 Specific Pneumonia Microbial Agents

Abbreviations: ICD-9, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision; ICD-9 +, presence of an ICD-9 code; ICD-9 −, absence of an ICD-9 code; laboratory+, presence of a laboratory sample identifying an organism; laboratory−, absence of a laboratory sample identifying an organism; MSSA, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus; MRSA, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; spp, several species.

Among 34 263 (21.2%) patients with either an organism-specific code or laboratory evidence, concordance between the 2 existed in fewer than half (eFigure in the Supplement). Table 3 shows the characteristics of ICD-9 coding against the microbiology criterion standard for certain common organisms. In general, specificities were high, with 98.9% for influenza virus and 99.9% for MSSA. Sensitivities were substantially lower for most organisms, ranging from 95.9% (95% CI, 95.3%-96.5%) for influenza virus to 14.0% (95% CI, 8.8%-20.8%) for parainfluenza virus. Although both NPV and PPV values were higher than 75% for most bacterial organisms, owing to the low prevalence, the NPVs were substantially higher than the PPVs. The PPVs varied widely, from as low as 57.1% (95% CI, 39.4%-73.7%) for parainfluenza virus to as high as 91.1% (95% CI, 89.5%-92.6%) for MSSA, and were notably lower (57.1%-70.8%) for mycoplasma (61.8%), influenza (70.8%), respiratory syncytial virus (67.2%), and parainfluenza virus (57.1%) than for most other organisms, eg, MRSA (76.0%), E coli (88.7%), and Legionella species (82.5%).

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

Key Points

Question

Are organism-specific International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) administrative codes for pneumonia valid measures in identifying pneumonia etiology?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of data from 161 529 patients hospitalized with pneumonia between 2010 and 2015, ICD-9 codes had generally low sensitivity but high specificity for pneumonia etiology identified by laboratory testing.

Meaning

In this study, ICD-9 codes appeared to underestimate prevalence of specific organisms.

### Respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospitalization rates among US infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2f7a4cd1]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Claims-based analyses that used ICD-9 codes were the most common study type, accounting for 65% of estimates. Using broader ICD-9 definitions (ie, more diagnosis fields) had minimal impact on RSV hospitalization rates, given that most RSV-associated illness was coded in the primary diagnosis field. Most claims-based studies (65%) included RSV coded in any diagnosis position.

Studies using RSV-specific codes could overestimate rates if some cases of infant bronchiolitis or pneumonia are coded as RSV without laboratory confirmation, and thus could be due to other pathogens like influenza or parainfluenza. However, available evidence suggests that RSV-coded hospitalizations are specific for true RSV disease, as prior analyses have shown high concordance (87%–99%) between RSV diagnosis codes and positive RSV tests in multiple settings. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that RSV-specific codes are preferentially chosen over generic bronchiolitis or pneumonia codes in the absence of laboratory data. In addition, because RSV constitutes such a large proportion of all-cause bronchiolitis (50%–80%) and pneumonia (30%–60%) in infants, and because unspecified bronchiolitis and pneumonia remain common diagnoses in claims databases, it seems unlikely that inaccurate coding of generic bronchiolitis or pneumonia as RSV-associated could entirely explain our findings. As evidence, previous research has shown that after RSV-coded bronchiolitis, unspecified bronchiolitis is the second-most-common reason for hospitalization among US infants, and that the burdens of RSV-coded and unspecified bronchiolitis are similar. These findings refute the notion that the burden of RSV-coded bronchiolitis is driven primarily by inaccurate coding of unspecified bronchiolitis, although more studies to evaluate the specificity of RSV diagnosis codes are needed.

Methods

Setting and Participants

This was a retrospective cohort study of patients younger than 18 years presenting to EDs participating in the Michigan Emergency Department Improvement Collaborative, (MEDIC) from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022. The study was classified as exempt by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. This study adhered to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

The MEDIC data registry includes electronic health record–extracted data elements for all ED visits among participating sites. We identified September 1 to December 31, 2022, as the time frame for focused analysis of the surge based on the rapid increase in pediatric ED visits in that period. We stratified the ED site types as children's hospitals, urban EDs with high pediatric volume (pediatric visits were ≥ 10% of the total visits), urban EDs with low pediatric volume (pediatric visits were < 10% of the total visits), and rural community EDs, based on the premise that ED operations and capacity to respond to pediatric surge are likely to vary significantly among these groups. Urban-rural designations were defined per standardized Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes as implemented in prior US research on locations of EDs.

We included ED visits based on review of all chief problems and diagnosis codes identified as likely attributable to the viral and respiratory illness surge in 3 steps. First, we included ED visits with a chief complaint for fever and/or respiratory signs and symptoms (eg, cough, rhinorrhea, shortness of breath). Second, we included visits with an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), diagnosis code (primary diagnosis or secondary diagnoses) for an infectious respiratory condition using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Clinical Classification Software Revised. These codes are broadly inclusive of common pediatric respiratory conditions such as asthma, croup, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. Third, we included ED visits with any ICD-10-CM code consistent with an acute viral syndrome, including syndromic codes (such as R06.02 [shortness of breath] and R50.9 [fever, unspecified]), as well as those specific to a particular viral pathogen (such as[contact with and suspected exposure to COVID-19] and J12.2 [parainfluenzavirus pneumonia]). eTables 1 and 2 in Supplement 1 detail the most common chief problems and ICD-10-CM codes used to define the cohort of pediatric respiratory and viral ED visits for analysis.

### Code-based syndromic surveillance for influenzalike illness by international classification of diseases, ninth revision [^b21d7a02]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

For each encounter linked to a specimen, we selected a single ICD-9 code per individual specimen. Some specimens had more than 1 encounter on the day matched, so we used the following algorithm for selection of the ICD-9 code: if 1 of the ICD-9 codes present was from the ILI syndrome list, it was selected. In cases in which patients had multiple ILI diagnoses, the more specific (for influenza first and other diseases second) or severe code was used, e.g. if both pneumonia and throat pain were included, pneumonia was selected; if pneumonia and influenza with pneumonia were included, influenza with pneumonia was selected (Table 1). If no ILI codes were used for the visit, the code closest to an infectious respiratory diagnosis was used; we gave priority to infectious disease or respiratory codes first, to general symptoms second, to other diagnoses third, and "V codes" (supplementary classification of factors influencing health status and contact with health services) last. We then measured the frequency of positive viral specimens by ICD-9 code.

### Clinical outcomes and severity of laboratory-confirmed RSV compared with influenza, parainfluenza and human metapneumovirus in Australian children attending secondary care [^cd583074]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Our study has many strengths, including the use of 10-year statewide population data on hospitalisations, ED presentations and pathology testing results to confirm virus-specific infection, rather than the reliance on ICD-10-AM coding, which is known to underestimate the burden of virus-specific infection. These data were linked with birth cohort data, which included sociodemographic and perinatal factors. Importantly, our study includes all children born during this time period, in contrast to some previous studies that have focused on specific subgroups such as preterm childrenor children admitted to the paediatric ICU.

However, some limitations should be acknowledged. We were missing data on the date of death for some children and have calculated a proxy date of death for children with missing dates of death using the death registration year, although it should be acknowledged that mortality from RSV in WA is rare. Additionally, we did not have information on influenza vaccination status for children older than 6 months of age. Our study included the early years of the pandemic (2020 and 2021), and rates of respiratory virus hospitalisations were lower in the second half of 2020/early 2021 as a result of border closures and non-pharmaceutical interventions. We also know that not all respiratory infection-coded admissions are tested for viruses, so our sample size was limited to those who underwent laboratory tests. Our study also did not capture those tested in the community by private pathology providers prior to or following hospital presentation. Furthermore, testing practices vary according to the age of the child, geographical location, season of admission and the presence of comorbid conditions. However, we do not believe that these variable testing rates (potentially under-reporting of virus-specific hospitalisations), and decreases in the incidence rate during the pandemic would significantly impact our findings comparing the clinical outcomes and admission-related factors between these four viruses. We did not distinguish between the different forms of ventilatory support (invasive vs non-invasive). We were also missing the date of ventilatory support for 11.5% of children under the age of 2 years. Finally, we only examined single infections in our analysis and excluded detections of more than one virus or viral-bacterial co-detections.

### Assessment of the accuracy of using ICD-9 diagnosis codes to identify pneumonia etiology in patients hospitalized with pneumonia [^9d4db9f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Although detailed clinical data represent the criterion standard for studying epidemiology, outcomes, and temporal trends in health care delivery, such data are cumbersome and expensive to collect. It is difficult to create research data sets large enough to represent the patient mix and the variety of health care settings; medical record abstraction requires intensive review by trained professionals and is subject to interobserver variability and observer bias. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention directs surveillance of specific health care–associated infections captured by the National Hospital Surveillance Network and engages a small number of academic centers to collect data through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Epicenters Program, but these data are limited in scope. In contrast, administrative data collected during routine clinical encounters for the purpose of reimbursement are copious, widely available, and generalizable. For these reasons, administrative data offer a potential alternative for some types of research. Administrative data have been used, for example, to evaluate temporal trends in pneumonia hospitalization and mortality, but there remains a paucity of efforts to validate administrative data with corresponding clinical information. Administrative data can be imprecise, with claims-based algorithms for some conditions demonstrating lower mortality, length of stay, and costs than independent clinical review.

Validation studies testing the accuracy of pathogen-specific coding have been rare in hospitalizations for infectious diseases in general and in pneumonia in particular. To establish the validity of administrative data regarding pneumonia, we examined the performance of pathogen-specific administrative coding in comparison with corresponding microbiological data in the setting of community-onset pneumonia in a large multicenter US database.

### Appropriateness of outpatient antibiotic prescribing among privately insured US patients: ICD-10-CM based cross sectional study [^29d80ece]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

In developing the scheme, we erred on the side of assuming appropriate antibiotic use. For example, we classified several codes as "always" even though antibiotics might not always be required (eg, pneumonia is often viral). As another example, we classified several diagnosis codes as "sometimes" even when oral antibiotics are rarely necessary (eg, infective otitis externa), or even when the diagnosis code typically implies a viral illness (eg, infectious colitis and gastroenteritis). As a final example, we classified some non-specific diagnosis codes as "sometimes" when they might be used to denote complications requiring antibiotics (eg, superficial thrombophlebitis, a diagnosis code that could be used for thrombophlebitis complicated by cellulitis).

Appendix 2 includes additional details about the classification scheme. For illustrative purposes, box 1 presents the classification scheme for diseases of the respiratory system (ICD-10-CM codes J00-J99), which are among the most common indications for outpatient antibiotic prescriptions. Appendix 3 includes a table summarizing the scheme by diagnosis code category. We also developed a similar classification scheme (although not used in the current study) of all 17 553 diagnosis codes in the final 2015 version of ICD-9-CM to facilitate analyses using older datasets, as well as a classification scheme of all 94 249 codes in the 2017 version of ICD-10-CM. Appendix 4 discusses the comparability of the 2015 ICD-9-CM and 2016 ICD-10-CM scheme. For each version of the scheme, a full list of classification decisions is included online.

Limitations

This study has limitations that should be considered. Our study included only a single center; other centers may have different ICD-10 performance characteristics. Our study also uses data from early in the pandemic, and performance characteristics could change over time. Furthermore, as noted earlier, clinicians may not document all symptoms in every case. Although we did not adjust for multiple comparisons, ICD-10 code performance is so poor that adjustment is unlikely to alter the interpretation of these results. Each case was reviewed by a single individual; because of the low complexity of the studied concepts (presence or absence of fever, cough, and dyspnea), a single-reviewer system is likely sufficient in this context. In addition, the reviewed cases were not selected randomly but rather in nearly real time as the pandemic situation evolved. This approach could introduce a bias but, again, given how poorly the codes perform, we doubt that a randomly selected sample would alter the results. Still, future studies should prespecify a plan for data validation, with a focus on sampling racial and ethnic minorities to ensure generalizable results.

### Increasing hospital admissions for pneumonia, england [^49f6b8ac]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

A range of organisms are implicated in the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia. These include S. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Chlamydia species, Legionella species, Staphylococcus aureus, and respiratory viruses (influenza, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], adenovirus, parainfluenza). In this study, only 6% of hospital admissions had a specific pathogen identified in the primary diagnostic code. The absence of microbiologic data in these cases means that indirect methods must be used to investigate the underlying etiology. For example, Muller-Pebody et al. used seasonal regression models to estimate that 42% of hospital admissions for unspecified pneumonia were attributable to S. pneumoniae, 10% to influenza, 9% to H. influenzae, 7% to Bordetella pertussis, and 5% to RSV. Further analysis is required to investigate whether such model estimates are similar when more recent HES data are used.

### Appropriateness of outpatient antibiotic prescribing among privately insured US patients: ICD-10-CM based cross sectional study [^ed993809]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

ICD-10-CM diagnosis code classification scheme

Following the approach used in previous studies, we classified each of the 91 738 diagnosis codes in the 2016 version of ICD-10-CM as "always" if the associated condition is almost always an indication for antibiotics (eg, pneumonia or urinary tract infection), "sometimes" if the condition is a potential indication for antibiotics (eg, acute sinusitis or acute otitis media), and "never" if the condition is almost never an indication for antibiotics (eg, acute upper respiratory tract infection, acute bronchitis, or non-infectious conditions). We did not adapt previous ICD-9-CM based classification schemes to ICD-10-CM owing to the differences between these coding systems. Additionally, we aimed to develop a scheme that could be applied to any administrative dataset. Therefore, we created a new scheme in which we classified each ICD-10-CM diagnosis code one by one. The primary author (KC) initially decided on the classifications, which the other authors (JAL and MAF) reviewed; disagreements were resolved by discussion until consensus was achieved. The authors included one general pediatrician and two general internists with expertise in the measurement of antibiotic overuse and medication use in administrative data.

### Comparison of international classification of diseases and related health problems, tenth revision codes with electronic medical records among patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 [^50399e03]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Do International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes accurately capture presenting symptoms of fever, cough, and dyspnea among patients being tested for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?

Findings

In this cohort study, an electronic medical record review of 2201 patients tested for COVID-19 between March 10 and April 6, 2020, found that ICD-10 codes had poor sensitivity and negative predictive value for capturing fever, cough, and dyspnea.

Meaning

These findings suggest that symptom-specific ICD-10 codes do not accurately capture COVID-19–related symptoms and should not be used to populate symptoms in electronic medical record–based cohorts.

### Pediatric acute respiratory virus hospitalizations: a population-based cohort study, 2017–2024 [^f979b4bf]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Additional details regarding data sources, diagnostic codes, and variable definitions are provided in the Supplementary Methods.

Study Population and Data

All youth aged < 18 years living in Ontario during the study period (1 July 2017 through 30 June 2024) were identified from a population registry of individuals eligible for the provincial universal health insurance program. Seasons were defined as 1 July through 30 June of the subsequent year, to capture the typical timing of northern hemisphere winter-time viruses such as RSV and influenza.

We identified all viral ARI-related hospitalizations using linked population-based health administrative databases (Supplementary Methods). For RSV, influenza, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), validated algorithms based on virus-specific International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision, Canada version (ICD-10-CA) codes were used to identify related admissions; for other pathogens (ie, human metapneumovirus [hMPV], parainfluenza, and rhinovirus), related admissions included those with any virus-specific ICD-10 code(s) located anywhere on the discharge record (Supplementary Methods). We also identified hospitalizations specific to 2 common ARI-related syndromes (bronchiolitis and bronchitis). Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, mechanical ventilation use, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use, and in-hospital death following an ARI-related hospitalization. Sociodemographic and health status characteristics were determined at index (ie, admission date or 1 July of a given year) using a combination of health- and census-based databases (Supplementary Methods). Datasets were linked using unique encoded identifiers and analyzed at ICES.

The use of data in this project was authorized under section 45 of Ontario's Personal Health Information Protection Act and exempt from research ethics board review. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines.

### Antibiotic treatment in patients hospitalized for nonsevere COVID-19 [^d3a79b92]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Eligibility Criteria

In our emulation of a hypothetical target trial, we used data from the Premier Healthcare Database to identify encounters for COVID-19 from April 2020 to December 2023. The Premier Healthcare Database contains deidentified data for approximately 25% of annual US inpatient admissions compiled from a geographically and structurally diverse group of acute care hospitals.

We included patients with an International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code for COVID-19 (U07.1) present on admission (POA) or an ICD-10 code for COVID-19 not POA and a billing charge for a COVID-19 test on day 1. Adult (age ≥ 18 years) patients with inpatient or observation encounters for COVID-19 were eligible. To focus on patients with respiratory symptoms, we required that chest imaging occurred on day 1. We excluded patients presenting with nonpneumonia bacterial infections or a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (ICD-10 code: J44.0/J44.1) because these patients have a separate indication for antibiotic treatment. We excluded patients presenting with nonpneumonia bacterial infections using a tiered antibiotic appropriateness ICD-10 code framework originally published by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigators that classifies diagnoses as always (eg, urinary tract infection), sometimes (eg, acute sinusitis), or never (eg, acute upper respiratory infection) appropriate (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). We excluded patients with POA diagnoses where antibiotics are always appropriate and those treated on day 1 with antibiotic regimens not targeting nonsevere CAP (eTable 2 in Supplement 1), as this suggests a suspected nonpneumonia bacterial infection or sepsis concern. Due to differences in antibiotic treatment protocols for patients with immunosuppression, including prophylaxis and broader spectrum coverage, we excluded patients receiving immunomodulating medications (eTable 2 in Supplement 1) on day 1 and patients with neutropenia POA (ICD-10 code: D70). Finally, we excluded patients who had already reached the primary outcome (eg, admitted to the intensive care unit [ICU]) on the day of admission according to billing and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition, Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) procedure codes (eTable 3 and eTable 4 in Supplement 2) and those with unknown sex. The number of patients evaluated at each step of eligibility and assigned to each treatment group are presented in the Figure.

### Viral pneumonia [^41f014f7]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has traditionally focused little on viral causes, and few studies have done an extensive and appropriate evaluation for viral cause. The purpose of the present article is to review several issues of viral infection in CAP in light of recent studies that included exhaustive evaluation of viruses.

Recent Findings

The introduction of better quality diagnostic tests, such as nucleic acid amplification techniques, have markedly improved our ability to detect multiple viral pathogens. With these diagnostic tools, a viral cause can be established in more than half of patients with CAP. Influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus are the most frequent causes of viral pneumonia followed by adenovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3, and influenza. Although some clinical findings have been more frequent with viral infection, no clear-cut clinical signs have been shown to be predictive of specific cause. Of more interest is the association of mixed virus-bacteria infection with poorer severity scores found in some studies. The diagnostic approach with new techniques should be taken for a true estimation of viral infection in epidemiologic studies. Unfortunately, there are no other licensed antivirals or vaccines against the large variety of clinically important respiratory viruses with the notable exception of influenza.

Summary

Given the high rate of viral infection in CAP and its probable association with poorer prognosis in mixed virus-bacteria infection, an extensive evaluation for virus in some populations seems appropriate. These findings can be useful for a more appropriate management of these patients.

### How accurate are international classification of diseases-10 diagnosis codes in detecting influenza and pertussis hospitalizations in children? [^97eec132]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2014). Low credibility.

Influenza and pertussis are major causes of pediatric morbidity. We measured the accuracy of their International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10-AM) diagnosis codes using linked population-based laboratory and hospital data in 245,249 children. Influenza diagnosis codes had high specificity (98.6%) and modest positive predictive value (PPV; 84.1%) and sensitivity (86.1%, 95% CI: 83.4%-88.6%) for a laboratory-confirmed episode. For pertussis diagnosis codes, PPV (86.8%) and specificity (98.9%) were high, but sensitivity was poor (27.8%, 95% CI: 23.5%-32.4%). Measures varied according to age, remoteness, Aboriginality, severity, and detection method. Both laboratory and hospitalization data are needed to accurately determine the burden of pediatric influenza and pertussis.

### Viral pneumonia [^cfbbdc38]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

About 200 million cases of viral community-acquired pneumonia occur every year-100 million in children and 100 million in adults. Molecular diagnostic tests have greatly increased our understanding of the role of viruses in pneumonia, and findings indicate that the incidence of viral pneumonia has been underestimated. In children, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and parainfluenza viruses are the agents identified most frequently in both developed and developing countries. Dual viral infections are common, and a third of children have evidence of viral-bacterial co-infection. In adults, viruses are the putative causative agents in a third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, in particular influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses. Bacteria continue to have a predominant role in adults with pneumonia. Presence of viral epidemics in the community, patient's age, speed of onset of illness, symptoms, biomarkers, radiographic changes, and response to treatment can help differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia. However, no clinical algorithm exists that will distinguish clearly the cause of pneumonia. No clear consensus has been reached about whether patients with obvious viral community-acquired pneumonia need to be treated with antibiotics. Apart from neuraminidase inhibitors for pneumonia caused by influenza viruses, there is no clear role for use of specific antivirals to treat viral community-acquired pneumonia. Influenza vaccines are the only available specific preventive measures. Further studies are needed to better understand the cause and pathogenesis of community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, regional differences in cause of pneumonia should be investigated, in particular to obtain more data from developing countries.

### Use of the postacute sequelae of COVID-19 diagnosis code in routine clinical practice in the US [^505766f9]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

A new International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis code (U09.9 Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified) was introduced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on October 1, 2021.

Objective

To examine the use of the U09.9 code and describe concurrently diagnosed conditions to understand physician use of this code in clinical practice.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study of US patients with an ICD-10-CM code for post-COVID-19 condition used deidentified patient-level claims data aggregated by HealthVerity. Children and adolescents (aged 0–17 years) and adults (aged 18–64 and ≥ 65 years) with a post-COVID-19 condition code were identified between October 1, 2021, and January 31, 2022. To identify a prior COVID-19 diagnosis, 3 months of continuous enrollment (CE) before the post-COVID-19 diagnosis date was required.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Presence of the ICD-10-CM U09.9 code.

Results

There were 56 143 patients (7723 female patients [61.2%]; mean [SD] age, 47.6 [19.2] years) with a post-COVID-19 diagnosis code, with cases increasing in mid-December 2021 following the trajectory of the Omicron case wave by 3 to 4 weeks. The analysis cohort included 12 622 patients after the 3-month preindex CE criteria was applied. Among this cohort, the median (IQR) age was 49 (35–61) years; however, 1080 (8.6%) were pediatric patients. The U09.9 code was used most often in the outpatient setting, although 305 older adults (14.0%) were inpatients. Only 698 patients (5.5%) had at least 1 of the 5 codes listed as possible concurrent conditions in the coding guidance. Only 8879 patients (70.4%) had a documented acute COVID-19 diagnosis code (569 [52.7%] among children), and the median (IQR) time between acute COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 diagnosis codes was 56 (21–200) days. The most common concurrently coded conditions varied by age; children experienced COVID-19-like symptoms (eg, 207 [19.2%] had cough and 115 [10.6%] had breathing abnormalities), while 459 older adults aged 65 years or older (21.1%) experienced respiratory failure and 189 (8.7%) experienced viral pneumonia.

Conclusions and Relevance

This retrospective cohort study found patients with a post-COVID-19 ICD-10-CM diagnosis code following the acute phase of COVID-19 disease among patients of all ages in clinical practice in the US. The use of the U09.9 code encompassed a wide range of conditions. It will be important to monitor how the use of this code changes as the pandemic continues to evolve.

### Antibiotic prescribing patterns for respiratory tract illnesses following the conclusion of an education and feedback intervention in primary care [^e2858863]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcome Assessment and Definitions

The primary outcome was the presence of an antibiotic prescription during an in-person RTD visit. Analyses were performed at the visit level so that patients with multiple visits could contribute each visit to the study period. Antibiotics that were included were limited to oral agents that would plausibly be prescribed for RTDs; antibiotics administered via alternative routes (eg, topical) or exclusively used for diagnoses not related to the respiratory tract (eg, fosfomycin) were excluded, as were antiviral and antifungal agents.

To determine the appropriateness of an antibiotic prescription, we adapted a tiered appropriateness assessment strategy, originally outlined by Fleming-Dutra et al and validated in the UPHS PC practices by Degnan et al]. In this approach, encounters were assigned to 1 of 3 tiers based on how frequently antibiotic therapy would be justified for a particular diagnosis, as assessed by ICD-10-CM codes assigned at the encounter. Tier 1 included diagnoses for which antibiotic prescribing is almost always appropriate (eg, bacterial pneumonia); tier 2 included diagnoses for which antibiotics are sometimes appropriate (eg, sinusitis); and tier 3 included diagnoses for which antibiotics are rarely indicated (eg, asthma, viral upper respiratory tract infection). For encounters in which multiple ICD-10-CM codes fell into multiple tiers of appropriateness, the lowest (ie, most appropriate) tier was selected. Visits were also grouped by the presence of ICD-10-CM codes for specific RTDs and respiratory signs and symptoms.

### Accuracy of influenza ICD-10 diagnosis codes in identifying influenza illness in children [^0ad7e482]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Our findings have major implications for the design and interpretation of future studies evaluating influenza. First, for observational studies that compare influenza and noninfluenza cases of respiratory infection, influenza ICD-10 codes may be a valid and efficient method of case identification because of their high PPV for laboratory-confirmed influenza. Second, for studies of influenza disease burden, our findings of moderate sensitivity of influenza ICD-10 codes mean that using these codes to identify cases of influenza illness will miss approximately one-half of cases in the ED and one-third of cases in the inpatient setting. There were generally low rates of influenza testing (23.2% in the ED and 48.3% in the hospital); furthermore, among patients with a positive influenza clinical test, 8.5% of patients in the ED and 10.9% inpatients did not receive an influenza diagnosis code. Estimates of influenza disease burden based on case identification with ICD-10 diagnosis codes may need to be adjusted for underascertainment. Furthermore, the accuracy of ICD-10 diagnoses is associated with clinical testing. With increasing availability of influenza testing and changes in testing practices following the COVID-19 pandemic, the accuracy of influenza diagnoses may increase in the future. Third, our results may inform the design of future age-based analyses. We identified age-based differences in the PPVs of influenza ICD-10 diagnosis codes, with the lowest PPV among hospitalized children younger than 1 year despite similar proportion of clinical testing compared with other ages. It is possible that the prevalence of other circulating viruses known to cause respiratory illness in young children may affect pathogen-specific physician coding. Future studies are needed to improve identification of hospitalized infants with influenza when using electronic health record or administrative claims databases.

### Comparison of international classification of diseases and related health problems, tenth revision codes with electronic medical records among patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 [^a5ef0d27]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

ICD-10 Classification Process

We extracted all ICD-10 codes associated with the SARS-CoV-2 testing visit for each patient by matching visit numbers. Codes specific for the outcomes (R50* for fever, R05* for cough, and R06.0* for dyspnea) were selected on the basis of the specifications suggested by the National COVID Cohort Collaborative. The asterisk (*) denotes that any code starting with the specified alphanumeric sequence would be included (ie, R06.03 is included for cough). Using this approach, the following codes were present in our data: R50.9, R50.81, R05, R06.02, R06.00, R06.03, and R06.09. Patients with at least 1 code in a given category were classified as having the symptom according to ICD-10 code.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Comparison of international classification of diseases and related health problems, tenth revision codes with electronic medical records among patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 [^6ece3d7b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Rapid access to well-characterized, large SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 cohorts is critical for scientific discovery. ICD-10 codes are a standard terminology and are attractive for data aggregation because they are uniformly used among health care systems. However, these codes perform poorly in capturing COVID-19–related symptoms. Our findings highlight the critical need for meticulous data validation to feed multicenter registries built from EMRs. Reliable, accurate data are the foundation of scientific discovery; the right data lead to the right solutions.

### Use of and comorbidities associated with diagnostic codes for COVID-19 in US health insurance claims [^4cec95fd]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Accurate identification of COVID-19 diagnosis in patient medical records is essential for studies using administrative data to examine morbidity, mortality, and risk factors associated with COVID-19. Before April 1, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested using the existing International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) code B97.29 (other coronavirus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere) as the primary diagnostic code for patients infected with COVID-19. On April 1, 2020, a new code U07.1 (2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease) was added to ICD-10-CM and was rapidly adopted by hospitals. Our study examined how nonhospital and hospital health care professionals have used these diagnostic codes in practice using a national medical claims data set in the US. We analyzed the comorbidities associated with COVID-19 diagnosis to assess the specificity of the legacy code and the importance of using both codes.

### Respiratory and nonrespiratory diagnoses associated with influenza in hospitalized adults [^65cfdf83]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Variables, Data Sources, and Measurement

For each patient, trained surveillance officers using a standardized case reporting form abstracted demographic data (including self-reported race/ethnicity), chronic medical conditions, clinical course and outcomes (length of stay, admission to the intensive care unit [ICU], use of mechanical ventilatory assistance, use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or in-hospital mortality), and discharge summary data from the medical record. We used the first 9 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)– and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) –coded discharge diagnoses as captured by FluSurv-NET to classify each patient's acute diagnoses during hospitalization. We excluded patients without any documented ICD codes. To assess how well influenza and related ICD codes are documented among persons hospitalized with confirmed influenza, we calculated the percentage of patients with discharge codes for influenza (ICD-9-CM codes 487–488 and ICD-10 codes J09-J11), pneumonia and influenza (ICD-9-CM codes 480–488 and ICD-10 codes J09-J18), and respiratory and circulatory diagnoses (ICD-9-CM codes 460–519 and 390–459 and ICD-10 codes J00-J99 and I00-I99).

We categorized ICD discharge codes as acute diagnoses by the terms acute, acute on chronic, or exacerbation. For ICD codes that did not contain these terms, we further classified diagnoses as acute if they were not known to be chronic conditions (eg, sepsis, bacteremia, rhabdomyolysis, and anaphylaxis). We categorized ICD codes into the following acute diagnosis groups: respiratory, neurologic, cardiovascular, endocrine, gastrointestinal, hematologic, acute kidney injury, anaphylaxis, sepsis, bacteremia, and transplant diagnoses. We excluded patients who were not categorized into 1 of these groups from the descriptive analysis that focused on acute diagnoses. A comprehensive list of acute ICD-9-CM and ICD-10 codes and their group classification are given in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Similar to proposed changes for the new International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11), we classified cerebrovascular accidents (ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke) under acute neurologic diagnoses.

### Respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus respiratory hospitalizations and outcomes in Colorado adults ≥ 50 years of age: 2016–2023 [^95d29026]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Colorado Hospital Association

This was a claims database study. The study population included all emergency room and inpatient (including ICU) encounters between 2016 and 2023 obtained from the CHA database. The CHA claims database contains data on every hospital visit from all acute medical care hospitals for adults at 93 Colorado hospitals (except the Veterans Affairs system hospital). Most rehabilitation, pediatric, and psychiatric hospitals in the state are also excluded from the 93 hospitals. The claims database contains de-identified demographic and hospital admission diagnostic data, duration, and place of stay (inpatient and ICU); it is structured such that inpatient (including ICU) encounters are distinct, nonoverlapping encounters. For a patient who experienced hospitalization and an ICU admission, the ICU admission is included in the hospitalization episode. ICU data are only reliably available from 2017 onward. Encounters were based on ICD-10 codes for medically attended ARIs according to the classifications by Piedra et al and Greenbaum et al, categorized as LRTI, ILI, and all other infections (other ARI). Furthermore, RSV-, influenza-, and HMPV-associated pneumonia, acute bronchitis, and various other specified respiratory diagnoses were identified. RSV was identified by ICD-10 codes B97.4, J12.1, J20.5, and J21.0; HMPV by B97.81, J12.3, and J21.1; and influenza by codes J09–J11. The proportion of both RSV- and HMPV-associated hospital encounters that were also coded with an influenza diagnosis was also assessed, to determine the contribution to symptomatic illness; although RSV and HMPV may more frequently be asymptomatic in younger adults, the literature suggests it is less commonly so among older adults.

### Assessment of the accuracy of using ICD-9 diagnosis codes to identify pneumonia etiology in patients hospitalized with pneumonia [^8da11ddb]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Results

The database included 515 684 patients before exclusions (Figure); among the 164 900 patients admitted with pneumonia who met inclusion criteria, cultures were obtained from 161 529 (98.0%) (mean [SD] age, 69.5 [16.2] years; 51.2% women) (Table 1), including blood cultures from 154 034 (93.4%) patients. Most patients (71.8%) were insured by Medicare, 87.8% were admitted through the emergency department, and most had a principal diagnosis of pneumonia (61.9%, including 9.3% by aspiration) or sepsis (32.1%). One-quarter of patients were treated in the intensive care unit, and 8.4% received invasive mechanical ventilation. The in-hospital mortality rate was 9.2%, and median length of stay was 5 days (interquartile range, 3–8 days). Median cost was $8356.41 (interquartile range, $5035.31-$14 928.49). Of the entire eligible cohort, 35 759 (22.1%) had a positive test result.

### Parainfluenza virus types 1–3 infections among children and adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia [^d663d5a4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Parainfluenza virus (PIV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections. Although there are several distinct PIV serotypes, few studies have compared the clinical characteristics and severity of infection among the individual PIV serotypes and between PIV and other pathogens in patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

Methods

We conducted active population-based surveillance for radiographically confirmed community-acquired pneumonia hospitalizations among children and adults in 8 US hospitals with systematic collection of clinical data and respiratory, blood, and serological specimens for pathogen detection. We compared clinical features of PIV-associated pneumonia among individual serotypes 1, 2, and 3 and among all PIV infections with other viral, atypical, and bacterial pneumonias. We also compared in-hospital disease severity among groups employing an ordinal scale (mild, moderate, severe) using multivariable proportional odds regression.

Results

PIV was more commonly detected in children (155/2354; 6.6%) than in adults (66/2297; 2.9%) (P < .001). Other pathogens were commonly co-detected among PIV cases (110/221; 50%). Clinical features of PIV-1, PIV-2, and PIV-3 infections were similar to one another in both children and adults with pneumonia. In multivariable analysis, children with PIV-associated pneumonia exhibited similar severity to children with other nonbacterial pneumonia, whereas children with bacterial pneumonia exhibited increased severity (odds ratio, 8.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.88–37.80). In adults, PIV-associated pneumonia exhibited similar severity to other pneumonia pathogens.

Conclusions

Clinical features did not distinguish among infection with individual PIV serotypes in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. However, in children, PIV pneumonia was less severe than bacterial pneumonia.

### Impact of seasonal and pandemic influenza on emergency department visits, 2003–2010, Ontario, Canada [^f0e17d59]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Protocol

The International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision, Canadian version (ICD-10-CA), was used for chart abstraction. ED visits were stratified by age and diagnostic category and aggregated to weekly levels. All 10 diagnostic fields were assessed to identify patient visits with specific clinical diagnoses. Diagnostic code groupings were chosen based on their association with either influenza symptoms or complications of an influenza infection in numbers likely to be large enough to be estimable. As virologic results were not captured in the NACRS database, any ED visit with a clinical diagnosis of influenza or ILI received an ICD-10 code of J11 (virus not specified). A range of other diagnoses is also possible for patients presenting to the ED due to complications resulting from an influenza infection; an unspecified viral respiratory infection (B34.9, B97.8, and J06.9); or any other acute respiratory infection (J00-J22), a category that includes pneumonia (J13-J18). The effect of influenza on otitis media (H65-H67) was also assessed, as this condition has been associated with influenza infections. In some cases, a diagnosis of an acute respiratory infection may have been missed or omitted, so the effect of influenza on chronic respiratory visits and the specific diagnostic categories of asthma (J45), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; J44), which are considered risk factors for influenza complications, were also considered. ED visits without respiratory complaints (J00-J99) were analyzed separately to assess any potential effect of increased patient load due to influenza on the operations of the ED.

### Respiratory and nonrespiratory diagnoses associated with influenza in hospitalized adults [^ca7e3737]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Seasonal influenza virus infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and may be associated with respiratory and nonrespiratory diagnoses.

Objective

To examine the respiratory and nonrespiratory diagnoses reported for adults hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza between 2010 and 2018 in the United States.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study used data from the US Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) from October 1 through April 30 of the 2010–2011 through 2017–2018 influenza seasons. FluSurv-NET is a population-based, multicenter surveillance network with a catchment area that represents approximately 9% of the US population. Patients are identified by practitioner-ordered influenza testing. Adults (aged ≥ 18 years) hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza were included in the study.

Exposures

FluSurv-NET defines laboratory-confirmed influenza as a positive influenza test result by rapid antigen assay, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, direct or indirect fluorescent staining, or viral culture.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Acute respiratory or nonrespiratory diagnoses were defined using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) discharge diagnosis codes. The analysis included calculation of the frequency of acute respiratory and nonrespiratory diagnoses with a descriptive analysis of patient demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, and in-hospital outcomes by respiratory and nonrespiratory diagnoses.

Results

Of 89 999 adult patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza, 76 649 (median age, 69 years; interquartile range, 55–82 years; 55% female) had full medical record abstraction and at least 1 ICD code for an acute diagnosis. In this study, 94.9% of patients had a respiratory diagnosis and 46.5% had a nonrespiratory diagnosis, including 5.1% with only nonrespiratory diagnoses. Pneumonia (36.3%), sepsis (23.3%), and acute kidney injury (20.2%) were the most common acute diagnoses. Fewer patients with only nonrespiratory diagnoses received antiviral therapy for influenza compared with those with respiratory diagnoses (81.4% vs 88.9%; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Nonrespiratory diagnoses occurred frequently among adults hospitalized with influenza, further contributing to the burden of infection in the United States. The findings suggest that during the influenza season, practitioners should consider influenza in their differential diagnosis for patients who present to the hospital with less frequently recognized manifestations and initiate early antiviral treatment for patients with suspected or confirmed infection.

### Severe human parainfluenza virus community-and healthcare-acquired pneumonia in adults at tertiary hospital, seoul, south Korea, 2010–2019 [^3e6f4bcc]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The characteristics of severe human parainfluenza virus (HPIV)-associated pneumonia in adults have not been well evaluated. We investigated epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of 143 patients with severe HPIV-associated pneumonia during 2010–2019. HPIV was the most common cause (25.2%) of severe virus-associated hospital-acquired pneumonia and the third most common cause (15.7%) of severe virus-associated community-acquired pneumonia. Hematologic malignancy (35.0%), diabetes mellitus (23.8%), and structural lung disease (21.0%) were common underlying conditions. Co-infections occurred in 54.5% of patients admitted to an intensive care unit. The 90-day mortality rate for HPIV-associated pneumonia was comparable to that for severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia (55.2% vs. 48.4%; p = 0.22). Ribavirin treatment was not associated with lower mortality rates. Fungal co-infections were associated with 82.4% of deaths. Clinicians should consider the possibility of pathogenic co-infections in patients with HPIV-associated pneumonia. Contact precautions and environmental cleaning are crucial to prevent HPIV transmission in hospital settings.

### Estimated cardiorespiratory hospitalizations attributable to influenza and respiratory syncytial virus among long-term care facility residents [^5cc45e60]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Cardiorespiratory Hospitalizations

Using MedPAR inpatient claims, we identified hospitalizations that occurred while individuals were residents of an LTCF. Hospitalizations were identified by the presence of an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis code in the principal position on the claim. Cardiovascular hospitalizations (ICD-9-CM codes 390.XX-459.XX; ICD-10-CM codes I00.XX-I99.XX) and respiratory hospitalizations (ICD-9-CM codes 460XX-519.XX; ICD-10-CM codes J00.XX-J08.XX and J12.XX-J99.XX) were identified as cardiorespiratory events. We identified explicit hospitalizations for pneumonia and influenza (ICD-9-CM codes 480.XX-488.XX; ICD-10-CM codes J09.XX-J18.XX) and RSV (ICD-9-CM codes 079.6. 480.1 and 466.11; ICD-10-CM codes J121, J205, J210, and B974) in which the virus was directly named in the diagnosis associated with the ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM code (eg, "Pneumonia due to respiratory syncytial virus"). This identification was done to quantify the incidence of admissions specifically for influenza and RSV infections. We chose to group pneumonia and influenza because pneumonia is often preceded by influenza infection, and these infections are difficult to distinguish using claims data. We estimated the cardiorespiratory events attributable to influenza and RSV, which were defined as any cardiorespiratory hospitalizations other than the aforementioned explicit pneumonia and influenza and RSV hospitalizations.

### Health disparities in complicated lower respiratory tract infections: a population-based cohort study in the hague, the Netherlands [^deb02b24]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Outcome measures

Our primary outcome, a complicated LRTI case, was defined as a patient with a pneumonia or influenza-like illness (ILI) diagnosis, who visited the emergency department (ED), received chest imaging (X-ray or CT) and was subsequently admitted to the hospital or died within 14 days. Those who died with LRTI as a registered cause of mortality, irrespective of an ED visit, were also considered complicated LRTI cases. To ensure only community-acquired cases were analysed, we excluded patients who had been discharged from a hospital within 30 days before the ED visit from the complicated LRTI and LRTI-related mortality outcomes, thereby avoiding inclusion of hospital-acquired cases. LRTI diagnoses during ED visits were defined based on the Dutch Diagnosis Treatment Combination (DTC) codes related to pneumonia or ILI. For internal medicine, the following DTC codes were included: 0313#401 (pneumonia), 0313#402 (interstitial pneumonia and COVID-19), 0313#409 (other respiratory tract infections, includingrespiratory syncytial virus (RSV)) and 0313#469 (other viral infections, including influenza). For pulmonary medicine, the included codes were: 0322#1401 (pneumonia and COVID-19), 0322#4 (bronchopneumonia), 0322#1405 (acute bronchitis) and 0322#5663 (acute bronchiolitis). These DTC codes correspond to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) classification system, codes J10–J22.

Our secondary outcome, LRTI-associated mortality, was defined as an LRTI patient who died within 30 days from the ED visit or as an individual who died with LRTI as a registered mortality cause, irrespective of an ED visit.

### International classification of disease coding for obstructive lung disease: does it reflect appropriate clinical documentation? [^3fb71031]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

International Classification of Disease coding is widely used by physicians, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to assess the health of populations and as a means of reimbursement for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current classification system, International Classification of Diseases, 9th ed (ICD-9), will soon be replaced by International Classification of Diseases, 10th ed (ICD-10). When the codes that relate to COPD and asthma are examined, the clinical relevance of the categories in International Classification of Disease coding must be questioned. In the future, a more simplified terminology that is consistent with clinical usage could improve accuracy and ease of coding. At present, however, clinicians should become familiar with the present ICD-9 and future ICD-10 codes so that their descriptions of illnesses in the medical records more accurately reflect current coding terminology.

### Clinical and financial burden of hospitalised community-acquired pneumonia in patients with selected underlying comorbidities in england [^d25728b8]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria

Participants had to be aged 18+ years in 2012/2013 and for inclusion needed to have at least one of the defined comorbidities. Patients with a diagnosis of CAP (online supplemental table 1, ICD-10) or evidence of inpatient death during 2012/2013 were excluded. Those patients with a secondary pneumonia diagnosis after 48 hours of the primary admission were also excluded as this as was considered to reflect hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) rather than CAP. Patients with missing data (approximately 0.5% of all data in HES), where the admission/visit/attendance did not have a corresponding Healthcare Resource Groups (HRG) code were excluded because it was not possible to cost the associated admission/visit/attendance in the absence of an HRG code. HRGs are standard groupings of clinically similar treatments which use comparable levels of healthcare resource, including groups of ICD-10 diagnoses that have similar resource implications. Outpatient follow-up visits included regular and programmatic visits among all groups.

Categorisation of CAP and non-CAP

Within each individual risk population, subjects were categorised into two groups based on the presence or absence of a primary or secondary diagnosis code for CAP (online supplemental table 1, ICD-10) in 2013/2014. However, if any secondary pneumonia diagnosis occurred after 48 hours of the primary admission, this subject was excluded as it was considered to be a HAP. Subjects were included in the non-CAP comparison group if there was no diagnosis of pneumonia (online supplemental table 1: ICD-10) during the three study years (2013/14 to 2015/16).

Outcome

The three key outcomes examined during the period 2013/2014 to 2015/2016 were healthcare resource utilisation (total number of hospital admissions, total number of outpatient attendances and total number of A&E visits), the costs associated with these activities and in-hospital mortality.

For each patient, the number of hospital admissions, outpatient attendances and A&E visits were retrieved from the database according to the corresponding HRG. Hospitalised mortality was defined when hospital discharge status was 'death'.

The associated costs for each activity were then determined using the appropriate National Health Service (NHS) tariffs and reported in 2016 UK pounds sterling (£). Costs from earlier years were adjusted using the Hospital and Community Health Services (HCHS) index from the Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU).

### Prevalence of common infectious diseases after COVID-19 vaccination and easing of pandemic restrictions in Israel [^49121ddd]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Covariates and Diagnoses

Patient database entries contained patient date of diagnosis, clinic number, visit number, date of birth, sex, residency area, and ICD-9 diagnosis. Using contiguous ICD-9 codes and based on anatomical and common clinical classification, infectious diseases were grouped into 1 of 3 categories: lower respiratory, upper respiratory, or gastrointestinal infections. Non–SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens included detected respiratory viruses (ie, adenovirus, influenza A and B, RSV, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, and other human coronaviruses), as well as undefined pathogens, based on clinical diagnosis only. Diagnoses based on only symptoms, such as cough or fever, were excluded. Patients were categorized into 7 age groups based on unique medical and social characteristics and on differences in restrictions that applied to each group (eg, closing daycares, severely restricting social interaction among young children) during and between pandemic lockdowns: 0 to 3 years, 4 to 11 years, 12 to 19 years, 20 to 34 years, 35 to 59 years, 60 to 79 years, and 80 years and older. Visits were categorized by age group and number of insured patients registered with a CHS clinic in the south, then multiplied by 100 000 to obtain age-specific IRs.

Viral Laboratory Tests

We further examined weekly numbers of respiratory viruses detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the RV-Essential multiplex assay test (Allplex). We conducted laboratory investigation only for respiratory infectious diseases, since the tests performed routinely in Israel for gastrointestinal infectious diseases include stool cultures only for common bacteria and not for viruses, which are known to be the most common cause of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. Tests were analyzed from January 2017 to July 2021 at the largest regional virology laboratory in southern Israel. Numbers and results of nasal swab tests with results positive for respiratory viruses were collected, and proportions were compared each week. Positive results in real-time PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded.

### The pneumonia etiology research for child health project: a 21st century childhood pneumonia etiology study [^25964ae0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

PERCH will employ and evaluate innovative diagnostic techniques and analytic methods that were not available during previous etiology studies. The understanding that H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae are the main causes of fatal pneumonia in children is supported primarily by 2 types of evidence: first, laboratory diagnoses from a limited number of lung aspiration studies of severe pneumonia cases seen at hospital facilities, and second, trials of antibiotic therapy and Hib and pneumococcal vaccines. In the latter instance, the proportionate reduction in cases of pneumonia or fatal pneumonia is used as a proxy for the proportion of cases or deaths due to the targeted bacterium, or specifically, Hib and/or pneumococcus. In recent clinical trials, Hib and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have prevented about one-fifth to one-third of x-ray confirmed pneumonia with alveolar consolidation.

Although current evidence suggests that fewer fatal pneumonia cases are due solely to viral infections, laboratory investigations of children in developing countries and elsewhere often show that respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza virus are identified from a large proportion of hospitalized patients with lower respiratory tract illness. In addition, there is increasing recognition of the importance of mixed infections and the interactions between viral and bacterial infections, for example, influenza virus infections that predispose to bacterial pneumonia. Nevertheless, even in comprehensive studies of pneumonia etiology, between one-quarter and one-third of patients fail to yield an obvious etiology, suggesting that better, more sensitive laboratory methods are needed. However, more sensitive tests may identify the presence of commensal pathogens that may not be the etiologic cause of the pneumonia episode being studied. Innovative or more rigorous epidemiologic methods are needed to establish the causal association between isolation of a potential pathogen and the pneumonia case being studied.

### Accuracy of influenza ICD-10 diagnosis codes in identifying influenza illness in children [^c241e6e7]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Studies of influenza in children commonly rely on coded diagnoses, yet the ability of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes to identify influenza in the emergency department (ED) and hospital is highly variable. The accuracy of newer International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes to identify influenza in children is unknown.

Objective

To determine the accuracy of ICD-10 influenza discharge diagnosis codes in the pediatric ED and inpatient settings.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Children younger than 18 years presenting to the ED or inpatient settings with fever and/or respiratory symptoms at 7 US pediatric medical centers affiliated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-sponsored New Vaccine Surveillance Network from December 1, 2016, to March 31, 2020, were included in this cohort study. Nasal and/or throat swabs were collected for research molecular testing for influenza, regardless of clinical testing. Data, including ICD-10 discharge diagnoses and clinical testing for influenza, were obtained through medical record review. Data analysis was performed in August 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The accuracy of ICD-10-coded discharge diagnoses was characterized using molecular clinical or research laboratory test results as reference. Measures included sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Estimates were stratified by setting (ED vs inpatient) and age (0–1, 2–4, and 5–17 years).

Results

A total of 16 867 children in the ED (median [IQR] age, 2.0 [0.0–4.0] years; 9304 boys [55.2%]) and 17 060 inpatients (median [IQR] age, 1.0 [0.0–4.0] years; 9798 boys [57.4%]) were included. In the ED, ICD-10 influenza diagnoses were highly specific (98.0%; 95% CI, 97.8%-98.3%), with high PPV (88.6%; 95% CI, 88.0%-89.2%) and high NPV (85.9%; 95% CI, 85.3%-86.6%), but sensitivity was lower (48.6%; 95% CI, 47.6%-49.5%). Among inpatients, specificity was 98.2% (95% CI, 98.0%-98.5%), PPV was 82.8% (95% CI, 82.1%-83.5%), sensitivity was 70.7% (95% CI, 69.8%-71.5%), and NPV was 96.5% (95% CI, 96.2%-96.9%). Accuracy of ICD-10 diagnoses varied by patient age, influenza season definition, time between disease onset and testing, and clinical setting.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this large cohort study, influenza ICD-10 discharge diagnoses were highly specific but moderately sensitive in identifying laboratory-confirmed influenza; the accuracy of influenza diagnoses varied by clinical and epidemiological factors. In the ED and inpatient settings, an ICD-10 diagnosis likely represents a true-positive influenza case.

### Trends in mortality from pneumonia in the Europe union: a temporal analysis of the European detailed mortality database between 2001 and 2014 [^5d7efa90]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This observational study of World Health Organisation European Detailed Mortality Database age-standardised mortality data found a low rate of pneumonia death across the EU, but did highlight considerable variability between the included countries. From years 2001 to 2014, there was a moderate decline in rates of death from pneumonia in the majority of European countries. This decrease is not universal, with specific exceptions in Lithuania and Poland. Furthermore, we identified a disparity in male and female mortality rates from pneumonia in the majority of countries assessed.

Reporting the trends in pneumonia mortality in European countries is important to allow comparison of statistical data at an international level, to assess the effectiveness of public health measures, and support the implementation of future interventions and initiatives. Our study aim was to report pneumonia mortality data from all countries of the EU that are classifying the disease using a single standardised international coding system. Time since the implementation of the ICD-10 mortality coding system is reaching 15 years in the majority of EU countries. To our knowledge, this study is the first to analyse pneumonia mortality trends across this study period using this system.

Unfortunately, incidence data for pneumonia mortality across Europe is severely lacking with only the UK, Finland and Spain having produced any precise population data. It is known that pneumonia mortality varies substantially between different European countries, but comparison is difficult due to differences in data acquisition and reporting, hospital admission criteria, and differences in disease management. Further difficulties arise from the lack of a universally recognised definition that can be used to reliably diagnose pneumonia. The absence of a productive cough, administration of pre-diagnosis antibiotics, and the absence of a definitive diagnostic microbiological test can also impair the quality and reliability of pneumonia mortality data.

Due to difficulties in clinical diagnosis, ICD codes are used to identify diseases and has become an international standard for classification. This study utilises the ICD-10 coding system, which allows the identification of death caused by a pneumonia infection and not as an end-point of a different underlying disease process. Studies have validated the use of ICD-10 codes to retrospectively identify pneumonia mortality and suggest its superiority to both the previous ICD-9 system and the use of clinical signs, symptoms and radiology.

### Comparison of international classification of diseases and related health problems, tenth revision codes with electronic medical records among patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 [^161f5054]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Health care organizations need rapid access to high-quality, multicenter data to support scientific discovery during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, the causative agent for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Electronic medical record (EMR) data could be repurposed to populate COVID-19 registries and surveillance systems. Several organizations are moving quickly to aggregate EMR data across multiple institutions to meet data needs. However, some critical data elements specific to COVID-19 may be unreliably captured by standard terminologies used in EMRs. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) is a widely used terminology, in which each code represents a clinical concept. Some codes may lack accuracy for the intended condition, a challenge that is germane to COVID-19–related symptoms. The goal of this project was to compare ICD-10 codes with manual EMR review in capturing symptoms of fever, cough, and dyspnea among patients being tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospitalization rates among US infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^cce99a15]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Characteristics

Studies identified were published between 2000 and 2020, and reported data collected between 1989 and 2016. Four types of estimates were identified: (1) active, prospective surveillance with etiologic confirmation of RSV (4 of 31; 13%), (2) retrospective MRR with etiologic confirmation of RSV (ie, passive surveillance of clinician-directed standard-of-care medical and laboratory records [3 of 31; 10%]), (3) retrospective analysis of administrative claims data using RSV-specific ICD-9 codes (20 of 31; 65%), and (4) model-based estimates that combined ICD-9 claims and etiologic surveillance data (4 of 31; 13%) (Tables 1 and 2). All active surveillance estimates came from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN) and identified RSV via viral culture and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction of nasal and throat swab samples taken from children hospitalized with acute respiratory infection in study catchment sites. Two retrospective MRR studies (67%) adjusted RSV rates upward to account for cases that were missed based on standard-of-care diagnostic and testing practices.

Table 1.
Study Characteristics

All claims-based studies used the same 3 ICD-9 codes to identify RSV: 466.11 (acute bronchiolitis due to RSV), 480.1 (RSV pneumonia), and 079.6 (RSV as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere). Most (13 of 20; 65%) included RSV codes in any diagnosis position, 3 of 20 (15%) included codes in the first or second diagnosis position, and 4 of 20 (20%) included RSV coded in the primary diagnosis position only.

### Clinical impact of healthcare-associated respiratory syncytial virus in hospitalized adults [^3ec5b50a]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Viral detection

The northern Manhattan study sites used the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT), which detects influenza types A H3, A H1, B; parainfluenza virus types 1–4; RSV; human metapneumovirus; adenovirus, rhinovirus and enterovirus; and human coronavirus types 229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43; as well as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bordatella pertussis, and Chlamydophilia pneumoniae. The Rochester study sites used either the FilmArray Respiratory Panel, Simplexa FLU/RSV Duplex (Diasorin Molecular, Cypress, CA) or Cepheid GeneXpert Flu/RSV Duplex (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA).

Data collection and outcomes

For HA-RSV patients, the reasons for hospitalization and for respiratory pathogen testing, such as worsening cough, were extracted from healthcare providers' progress notes. International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) discharge codes that were related to RSV (ie, B97.4, J12.1, J20.5, or J21.0) were extracted from the EMR, and cause(s) of death were abstracted from the death certificate or death notes, when applicable.

For both HA-RSV and CO-RSV patients, demographic, and clinical characteristics, including comorbid conditions and living situation at admission, were collected. Living situation was classified as living independently at home, living at home with assistance from family members or home health aide or residing in an assisted living facility, or living in a rehabilitation or skilled nursing facility. Patients transferred from acute-care hospitals or who were homeless were excluded from assessment of living situation at admission.

For both HA-RSV and CO-RSV patients, outcomes included length of stay after RSV detection, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and/or mechanical ventilation initiated in the 4 days following RSV detection, and in-hospital mortality. For those who survived, living situation at discharge and changes in living situation from admission to discharge that reflected the need for increased support (eg, living independently at admission versus discharge to a skilled nursing facility) were determined as previously described. Patients who died, were transferred to another acute-care hospital, or were not eligible for the analysis of living situation at admission were excluded from the analysis of changes in living situation. Readmission within 30 days of discharge was also assessed.

### About human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) [^216a2520]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What to know
- Signs and symptoms of HPIVs are similar to the common cold.
- Washing hands, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact with people who are sick can help prevent infection.
- Most people with HPIVs will recover on their own. More Information. Signs and symptoms HPIVs commonly cause upper and lower respiratory illnesses in infants, young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems, but anyone can get infected. Symptoms generally appear 2 to 6 days after infection. Signs and symptoms are similar to the common cold and can include:

- fever
- runny nose
- cough
- sneezing
- sore throat.

Other symptoms of HPIV illness may include:

- ear pain
- irritability
- decreased appetite HPIVs can also cause more serious illness in children, including:

- croup
- bronchitis
- bronchiolitis
- pneumonia. Symptoms of more serious illness may include:

- barking cough
- hoarseness
- stridor
- wheezing In adults, upper respiratory infections and bronchitis are the most common illnesses caused by HPIVs; signs and symptoms may include fever, runny nose, cough, and sore throat. Pneumonia may occur, especially in older adults and people with weakened immune systems. You can have multiple HPIV illnesses in your lifetime. When to seek emergency care.

Prevention Currently, there is no vaccine to protect you against infection caused by HPIVs. However, researchers are trying to develop vaccines. You may be able to reduce your risk of HPIV and other respiratory viral infections by taking everyday actions to help stop the spread of germs, like:

- washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.
- avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth
- avoiding close contact with people who are sick. Frequent hand washing is especially important in childcare settings. Breastfeeding may protect babies from HPIVs during their first few months of life. That's because mothers may have antibodies in their breast milk to fight infection. If you are sick with a common cold illness or cough that may be caused by HPIV, you can help protect others by:

- staying home while you are sick
- avoiding close contact with others
- covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze
- keeping objects and surfaces clean and disinfected
- You may also consider wearing a well-fitted mask. Children ages 2 years and older can wear masks or respirators to protect themselves and others from HPIVs. Treatment There is no specific antiviral treatment for HPIV illness. Most people with HPIV illness will recover on their own. However, to relieve symptoms, you can:

- take acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and other over-the-counter medications for pain and fever
- use a room humidifier or take a hot shower to help ease a sore throat and cough. People who are sick should:

- drink plenty of liquids
- stay home and rest Antibiotics are not effective against HPIVs. Antibiotics are only effective against bacteria. For information about safe antibiotic use, see CDC's Antibiotic Prescribing and Use.

### Viral detection in children [^2a455582]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and croup account for a substantial burden of pediatric hospitalizations. We aim to provide an updated, multi-center, multi-pathogen evaluation of viral detections seen with these acute respiratory illness (ARI) syndromes before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods

We included children < 5 years with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis, pneumonia, or croup during 2017–2023 from the New Vaccine Surveillance Network. Respiratory viruses were detected with a research ± clinical respiratory swabs; demographic and clinical data were obtained from caregiver interview and chart review. Virus-specific proportions across all three ARI syndromes were described, including comparisons stratified by age, surveillance year including pre- (2017–2019) and post (2021–2023) COVID-19 onset periods, and underlying medical condition.

Results

Among 14,340 cases of bronchiolitis, 4,423 cases of pneumonia, and 2,367 cases of croup, > 80% had one or more respiratory virus detected. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequent virus detected in bronchiolitis (41%) and pneumonia (26%), with a similar distribution across the COVID-19 onset periods. Parainfluenza virus (PIV) was the most frequent virus detected in croup (28%), but detections fell in the post-COVID-19 onset period by 8.4%; there was a comparable proportion of SARS-CoV-2 detections (7.6%) that emerged among croup cases. Rhinoviruses/enteroviruses (RV/EV) were the second most frequently detected virus across all three ARI syndromes and were the predominant virus in children < 6 months and children with an underlying medical condition diagnosed with croup. Codetections were present in 17–19% of bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and croup cases.

Discussion

We found a high proportion of respiratory viral detections in children < 5 years with bronchiolitis, pneumonia, or croup, particularly with RSV, RV/EV, and PIV. Most viruses were identified in similar proportions before and after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, except for PIV and influenza virus. In our cohort, there was a high proportion of viral detection across all three ARI syndromes, with RV/EV frequently detected in certain age groups and among children with underlying conditions.

### Human parainfluenza virus-associated hospitalizations among children less than five years of age in the United States [^c86b014e]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Human parainfluenza viruses 1 through 3 (HPIV-1-3) are important causes of respiratory tract infections in young children. This study sought to provide current estimates of HPIV-1-3-associated hospitalizations among US children.

Methods

Hospitalizations for bronchiolitis, bronchitis, croup and pneumonia among children age < 5 years were determined for the years 1979 through 1997 using the National Hospital Discharge Survey. Average annual hospitalizations during the last 4 years of the study for each of these four diseases were multiplied by the proportions of each disease associated with HPIV-1-3 infection (as previously reported in hospital-based studies) to estimate hospitalizations potentially associated with HPIV-1-3 infections. Seasonal trends in HPIV-1-3-associated hospitalizations were compared with HPIV detections in the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System, which prospectively monitors respiratory viral detections throughout the United States.

Results

The proportions of hospitalizations associated with HPIV infection for each disease varied widely in the 6 hospital-based studies we selected. Consequently our annual estimated rates of hospitalization were broad: HPIV-1, 0.32 to 1.59 per 1,000 children; HPIV-2, 0.10 to 0.86 per 1,000 children; and HPIV-3, 0.48 to 2.6 per 1,000 children. Based on these data HPIV-1 may account for 5,800 to 28,900 annual hospitalizations; HPIV-2 for 1,800 to 15,600 hospitalizations; and HPIV-3 for 8,700 to 52,000 hospitalizations.

Conclusions

We provide broad, serotype-specific estimates of US childhood hospitalizations associated with HPIV infections. More precise estimates of HPIV-associated hospitalizations would require large prospective studies of HPIV-associated diseases by more sensitive viral testing methods, such as polymerase chain reaction techniques.

### Death certificate-based ICD-10 diagnosis codes for COVID-19 mortality surveillance-United States, January-December 2020 [^558158a2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Approximately 375,000 deaths during 2020 were attributed to COVID-19 on death certificates reported to CDC (1). Concerns have been raised that some deaths are being improperly attributed to COVID-19 (2). Analysis of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnoses on official death certificates might provide an expedient and efficient method to demonstrate whether reported COVID-19 deaths are being overestimated. CDC assessed documentation of diagnoses co-occurring with an ICD-10 code for COVID-19 (U07.1) on U.S. death certificates from 2020 that had been reported to CDC as of February 22, 2021. Among 378,048 death certificates listing U07.1, a total of 357,133 (94.5%) had at least one other ICD-10 code; 20,915 (5.5%) had only U07.1. Overall, 97.3% of 357,133 death certificates with at least one other diagnosis (91.9% of all 378,048 death certificates) were noted to have a co-occurring diagnosis that was a plausible chain-of-event condition (e.g., pneumonia or respiratory failure), a significant contributing condition (e.g., hypertension or diabetes), or both. Overall, 70%-80% of death certificates had both a chain-of-event condition and a significant contributing condition or a chain-of-event condition only; this was noted for adults aged 18–84 years, both males and females, persons of all races and ethnicities, those who died in inpatient and outpatient or emergency department settings, and those whose manner of death was listed as natural. These findings support the accuracy of COVID-19 mortality surveillance in the United States using official death certificates. High-quality documentation of co-occurring diagnoses on the death certificate is essential for a comprehensive and authoritative public record. Continued messaging and training (3) for professionals who complete death certificates remains important as the pandemic progresses. Accurate mortality surveillance is critical for understanding the impact of variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and of COVID-19 vaccination and for guiding public health action.

CMC Case Definitions and Population-Based Prevalence Data

To define a population-based incidence, we needed to estimate the prevalence of CMCs in the catchment population to be considered as our denominator. This study was an extension of 2 previous studies, which assessed the incidence rates (IRs) of RSV and influenza and hospitalizations among adults stratified by the same CMC. The methods used to determine the population-based CMC prevalence of our resident populations in the study area have been outlined, and additional details are provided in the supplementary appendices in these publications. Details of these methods and data sources are provided in Supplementary Material B1, and variables entered into each partial least squares (PLS) model are listed in Supplementary Material B2.

Although pharmaceutical and laboratory definitions of CMCs are common, they often fail to differentiate among similar disease states. Therefore, PLS models, a type of machine learning, were developed to assess each CMC status by training the study population's health data (prescribed medications, medication class combinations, and laboratory test results) to CMC-specific hospitalization ICD-10-CM codes (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification). CMC-specific health variables or health variables, or those that can differentiate closely related CMCs, were included as predictors in the PLS model. Each variable was then weighted according to its association with specific ICD-10-CM codes, enhancing the model's sensitivity. The optimal threshold for assigning each PLS-predicted CMC status was determined by randomly sampling 100 000 individuals and applying the Youden-modified optimality criterion, with expected CMC prevalences according to New Zealand CMC statistics. If an individual's health data met the threshold for the model-predicted CMC status based on the model weighting, then that CMC status was assigned to the individual. Using these models, we predicted the CMC statuses for adults who did not have CMC-specific ICD-10-CM codes but had sufficient health data to meet the model-predicted CMC threshold. Previous studies employed similar methodologies to assign CMC status to populations. However, the model was not utilized to predict CVA and ESRD status due to inaccuracies in estimating their prevalence. Therefore, CVA status was assigned only by ICD-10-CM discharge codes for all adults. ESRD status was assigned with a combination of ICD-10-CM codes and laboratory results from routine medical care in New Zealand (supplementary appendices and Supplementary Material B2).

### Comparison of international classification of diseases and related health problems, tenth revision codes with electronic medical records among patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 [^bbf51557]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Symptoms are an essential part of data collection for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 surveillance and research, but symptom-specific ICD-10 codes lack sensitivity and fail to capture many patients with relevant symptoms; the false-negative rate is unacceptably high. Common data models and other aggregation tools rely heavily on ICD-10 codes to capture clinical concepts; inaccuracy has implications for any downstream scientific discovery or surveillance. For example, symptom surveillance could be important to detect subsequent waves of COVID-19, similar to the US Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance Network. A substantial number of patients would be missed if ICD-10 codes were used for this task.

ICD-10 codes are known to lack accuracy for clinical diagnoses and concepts. For example, ICD-10 codes perform poorly to identify patients with atrial fibrillation, with a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 42%. Similar inaccuracies have been reported for other conditions, such as stroke and acute kidney injury. Our work represents clinician documentation of symptoms, and clinicians may not document all symptoms for all patients, particularly when patient volume is high or in drive-through testing scenarios. In other words, clinician documentation is not necessarily the "gold standard," but rather a reference standard. Other strategies include checklist type data entry to support standardized data collection or capturing symptoms directly from the patient. Several public health agencies are developing smartphone applications that allow people to report symptoms directly to appropriate officials. For health care systems, patient-reported outcomes may allow more reliable symptom capture, without reliance on billing codes or clinician documentation.

Our findings highlight the importance of quality control in COVID-19 data aggregation, which has become increasingly important with recent high-profile journal retractions. Critical data elements require careful validation to ensure that discoveries translate into effective interventions that reduce morbidity and mortality. As with many aspects of this pandemic, we must pay careful attention to socioeconomically vulnerable populations, including racial minorities, rural patients, and low-income patients, for whom the gap between ICD-10 coding and clinical reality could be greater.

Regarding specific circumstances for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, microbiological testing, viral testing, IDSA/PIDS 2011 guidelines recommend to obtain sensitive and specific tests for the rapid diagnosis of influenza virus and other respiratory viruses in pediatric patients with CAP. Recognize that a positive influenza test may decrease both the need for additional diagnostic studies and antibiotic use while guiding the appropriate use of antiviral agents in both outpatient and inpatient settings.

### Coding long COVID: characterizing a new disease through an ICD-10 lens [^c21b8f63]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Naming a newly discovered disease is a difficult process; in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the existence of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), which includes long COVID, it has proven especially challenging. Disease definitions and assignment of a diagnosis code are often asynchronous and iterative. The clinical definition and our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of long COVID are still in flux, and the deployment of an ICD-10-CM code for long COVID in the USA took nearly 2 years after patients had begun to describe their condition. Here, we leverage the largest publicly available HIPAA-limited dataset about patients with COVID-19 in the US to examine the heterogeneity of adoption and use of U09.9, the ICD-10-CM code for "Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified".

Methods

We undertook a number of analyses to characterize the N3C population with a U09.9 diagnosis code (n = 33,782), including assessing person-level demographics and a number of area-level social determinants of health; diagnoses commonly co-occurring with U09.9, clustered using the Louvain algorithm; and quantifying medications and procedures recorded within 60 days of U09.9 diagnosis. We stratified all analyses by age group in order to discern differing patterns of care across the lifespan.

Results

We established the diagnoses most commonly co-occurring with U09.9 and algorithmically clustered them into four major categories: cardiopulmonary, neurological, gastrointestinal, and comorbid conditions. Importantly, we discovered that the population of patients diagnosed with U09.9 is demographically skewed toward female, White, non-Hispanic individuals, as well as individuals living in areas with low poverty and low unemployment. Our results also include a characterization of common procedures and medications associated with U09.9-coded patients.

Conclusions

This work offers insight into potential subtypes and current practice patterns around long COVID and speaks to the existence of disparities in the diagnosis of patients with long COVID. This latter finding in particular requires further research and urgent remediation.

Influenza viruses have occasionally been associated with severe manifestations of croup, but no comparative studies of different viral etiologies are available. In a retrospective study we compared the clinical courses of croup caused by influenza and parainfluenza viruses in hospitalized children. By several indicators the clinical picture of croup caused by influenza viruses was significantly more severe than that caused by parainfluenza viruses.

Unadjusted and Adjusted Relative Mortality Risks (RMRs) per ICD-10 Chapter Comparing 2016–2019 With 2020

Abbreviation: ICD-10, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (German modification).

When IRRs for averaged absolute death counts per day were calculated, a higher IRR was found only for the subgroup of respiratory diseases (IRR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.13–1.46; P < .001) and not for the total cohort (IRR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80–0.93; P < .001) or other subgroups in which a lower or unchanged mortality based on IRRs was found (Table 3). When the most frequently used codes within the ICD-10 chapter of respiratory diseases were further specified, mortality associated with a main diagnosis of ICD-10 code J12 (viral pneumonia, not classified elsewhere) was associated with a marked IRR increase (IRR, 120.1; 95% CI, 31.7–455.5; P < .001), whereas there was no association with increased IRRs for the next most frequently used ICD-10 codes in this group. After exclusion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, IRRs were significantly associated with decreased IRRs for the total cohort (IRR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.72–0.84; P < .001), infectious and parasitic diseases (IRR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59–0.87; P < .001), neoplasms (IRR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.61–0.82; P < .001), endocrine diseases (IRR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72–1.00; P = 0.046), nervous diseases (IRR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65–0.99; P = 0.04), circulatory/cardiovascular diseases (IRR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.76–0.89; P < .001), respiratory diseases (IRR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74–0.92; P < .001), and diseases of the digestive system (IRR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.68–0.87; P < .001). No association with increased IRR was found for the ICD group of viral pneumonia (ICD-10 code J12) after the exclusion of patients with SARS-CoV-2. Detailed results regarding IRRs for absolute in-hospital death numbers are presented in Table 3. For patients with emergency hospital admission only, comparable results were found for the overall population and patients within the single ICD-10 chapters. Subdividing the reference cohort into a 2016/2017 and a 2018/2019 cohort showed no changes for the IRR analyses. There were minor changes regarding the RMR analyses within the disease groups of nervous, musculoskeletal, and genitourinary diseases, as well as neoplasms. Detailed results of those RMR analyses are provided in eTables 3 and 4 in the Supplement.

### Risk of clinical sequelae after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection: retrospective cohort study [^4d43d32f]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

2019 comparator group

We created this historical comparison group to account for possible ascertainment bias because of reduced use of healthcare services during the 2020 pandemic. Individuals aged 18–65 were required to have continuous enrollment in the health plan from 1 January 2018 to a randomly assigned month and day in 2019, drawn from the SARS-CoV-2 infection group.

Viral lower respiratory tract illness comparator group

We created this historical comparison group to evaluate the clinical sequelae specific to SARS-CoV-2 infection because many serious viral illnesses have a risk of morbidity after the acute illness. The viral lower respiratory tract illness group included individuals aged 18–65 who developed influenza (J09, J10, J11), non-bacterial pneumonia (J12, J18.9), acute bronchitis (J20), acute lower respiratory infection (J22), or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute lower respiratory infection (J44.0), between 1 January 2017 and 31 October 2017, 1 January 2018 and 31 October 2018, or 1 January 2019 and 31 October 2019. We included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation because instances are typically induced by a virus and identified only with code J44.0. We defined the index date as the date of the first diagnosis of viral lower respiratory tract illness in the corresponding year of the cohort. Individuals were required to have continuous enrollment in the health plan from 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017, or 1 January 2018 to the index date, respectively.

Main outcomes

We used ICD-10 codes to identify new clinical diagnoses from the administrative claims data between 1 January 2020 and 31 October 2020. eTable 1 shows the ICD-10 classification details. We created domain clusters based on clinically similar diagnoses, and we included atopic dermatitis as a negative control.

### Trends in non-COVID-19 hospitalizations prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic period, United States, 2017–2021 [^5c63aa10]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The outcome of interest was the primary (i.e. first) diagnostic field recorded for each visit as categorized by the International Classification of Diseases-Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes. We included only the primary diagnostic code for each hospitalization in order to limit the influence of diagnoses not directly related to admission. Primary diagnostic codes for all patients were grouped by ICD-10 chapter (2016 edition of ICD-10-CM), subchapter, month, and year. These chapters are primarily organized according to body system affected, totaling 22 chapters, of which diagnostic codes falling into chapters 1 through 19 were assessed (excluding chapters for external morbidity, special purpose codes, and health services contact codes) (Supplementary Table S1). Subchapter groupings were created according to categories defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and were primarily organized by type of infectious agent identified, type of illness, or part of body affected in addition to codes for "unspecified" or "unknown" illness. The 19 chapters could be subdivided into 236 subchapters, but subchapters with fewer than 5,000 diagnoses total between 2017 and 2019 were excluded from all analyses (47 exclusions) (Supplementary Table S2).

### Assessment of the accuracy of using ICD-9 diagnosis codes to identify pneumonia etiology in patients hospitalized with pneumonia [^d9349377]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has limitations. The case selection algorithm may have insufficiently discriminated pneumonia from other infection diagnoses, and identified pathogens may represent colonization rather than infection. For example, many patients had culture growth but no corresponding ICD-9 coding event. This subset of patients tended to have more comorbid conditions. Although all patients had a diagnosis of pneumonia, it is possible that the specific pneumonia code was missed owing to truncation of diagnoses. MRSA and MSSA may also be coded as present based on the result of a nasal swab, which we did not include because nasal passages may not accurately represent lung flora. The presence of an ICD-9 code indicating infection without culture results could represent coding based on clinical suspicion, available data from a transferring institution, or late reporting of growth after hospital discharge. We also excluded patients who did not have any cultures. Although this number was small, it may have introduced a bias in detection rates.

Of note, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) coding was implemented in the US on October 1, 2015, and is far more detailed than ICD-9, making it difficult to study a population across the transition. Thus, our analysis is limited to 2010–2015. Nonetheless, the process by which codes are chosen has not changed, and it is possible to crosswalk from ICD-10 to ICD-9. In addition, it is not known how our results may be applicable to other large administrative data sets. Because this was a national sample, coding is likely to be similar, but it is possible that hospitals outside of the Premier Healthcare Database have different coding patterns. Validation in additional data sets would be welcome.

### Evaluation of 3 electronic methods used to detect influenza diagnoses during 2009 pandemic [^ddd52192]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Classifying influenza by antiviral prescription was sensitive but less specific than clinical diagnosis. This finding could be explained by empiric antiviral prescriptions for infectious respiratory symptoms being written before confirmatory testing. Influenza classification by positive laboratory tests was specific but less sensitive in this analysis, probably because of nonuniform laboratory testing among inpatients from lack of specific criteria to guide testing and lack of testing in those with less severe illness. Not all patients who have influenza are tested for it, and these diagnoses would be classed as false negatives, influencing the sensitivity downward. Furthermore, laboratory testing would be likely to miss patients with influenza-triggered exacerbations of congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which would underestimate influenza cases.

Our study correlated ICD-10-CM–specific codes for influenza in hospitalized adults during 1 peak of the 2009 influenza pandemic. A previous study in the United States in 2006 evaluated ICD-9-CM admission and discharge influenza codes in hospitalized children. The authors found that of 715 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases, ICD-9-CM codes were only 65% sensitive, suggesting that use of these codes for surveillance would underestimate influenza hospitalizations by 35%. This work was undertaken in 3 consecutive nonpandemic influenza seasons during 2001–2004.

Our findings must be generalized with caution because our study evaluated ICD-10-CM coding accuracy over 3 months of a pandemic influenza season in adults at 1 academic hospital. With lower influenza prevalence, the PPV would drop, suggesting that the coded diagnosis would overestimate influenza hospitalizations. Furthermore, sensitivity and specificity of codes might not be static measures because the diagnosis of influenza on the chart might be influenced by the prevalence of influenza in communities.

Given these limitations, further work is needed to fully validate ICD-10 codes for influenza during seasons of low prevalence and in other populations including children. Despite this, our results have implications for future research using administrative data to develop timely surveillance systems, track costs, and monitor resource use.

### Trends in gastroenteritis-associated mortality in the United States, 1985–2005: variations by ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes [^22ad1239]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Mortality records are coded using the International Classification of Disease (ICD), which was recently modified. In 1999, coding for mortality changed from using the ICD-9 scheme to ICD-10. The ICD-10 system is more detailed with approximately 8,000 categories for disease classification compared to about 5,000 categories in the ICD-9 system. Few studies have demonstrated that the changes from ICD-9 to ICD-10 coding can affect trends in mortality. A study in Italy demonstrated that there was little variability between the two schemes for the larger disease groups, such as diseases of the circulatory system, however, the variability was higher for 'minor' disease groups such as infectious diseases and respiratory diseases. A study focusing on respiratory disease mortality in the United Kingdom demonstrated that there was a 22% decrease in deaths assigned to respiratory disease under the ICD-10 coding scheme. In the Southeastern United States, a study found that the change to ICD10 underestimated mortality due to heart disease and cerebrovascular disease and overestimates deaths due to diabetes. In the U.S. it has been shown that implementing ICD-10 has variable effects on the discontinuity in trend; for some leading causes of death, such as influenza and pneumonia the discontinuity is substantial.

In this study we examine rates and trends in gastroenteritis-associated mortality for a 21-year period from 1985 to 2005, during which the ICD-10 coding scheme, was implemented by categories of pathogens (viral, bacterial, protozoal). The ICD-10 coding scheme differs in several aspects from the ICD-9 scheme, including more detailed classification. Of importance for this study, coding rules and rules for selecting the underlying cause of death have been changed in the ICD-10 system. Therefore, in this paper our analysis is stratified based on the ICD system used and assesses changes in ICD coding on gastroenteritis associated mortality.

### Breaking ICD codes: identifying ambiguous respiratory infection codes via regional diagnosis heterogeneity [^36a752c9]. Annals of Family Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We aimed to analyze regional variations in the assignment of International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes to acute respiratory infections, seeking to identify notable anomalies that suggest diverse diagnoses of the same condition.

Methods

We analyzed national weekly diagnosis data for acute respiratory infections (ICD-10 codes J00-J22) in Poland from 2010 to 2019, covering all 380 county-equivalent administrative regions and encompassing 292 million consultations. Data were aggregated into age brackets. We calculated the Kendall tau correlations between shares of particular diagnoses.

Results

We found staggering differences across regions in applied diagnoses that persisted even after disaggregating the data into age groups. The differences did not seem to stem from different levels of health care use, as there was no consistent pattern suggesting variability in milder diagnoses. Instead, there were numerous pairs of strongly negatively correlated codes implying classification ambiguity, with the most problematic diagnosis being J06 (acute upper respiratory infections of multiple and unspecified sites), which was used almost interchangeably with a diverse range of others, especially J00 (common cold) and J20 (bronchitis).

Conclusions

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using observable anomalies to analyze regional coding variability for the same respiratory infection. Although some of these discrepancies may raise concerns about misdiagnosis, the majority of cases involving interchangeably used codes did not seem to substantially impact treatment or prognosis. This suggests that ICD codes may have clinical ambiguities and could face challenges not only in fulfilling their intended purpose of generating internationally comparable health data but also in their use for comprehensive government health planning.

### Acute lower respiratory tract infections in soldiers, south Korea, April 2011-March 2012 [^bdb1e35d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The Study

The study was conducted during April 2011–March 2012 at the Armed Forces Capital Hospital, a military referral hospital in Seongnam, South Korea. We retrospectively reviewed all medical records with International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes indicating acute LTRI (pneumonia, tracheobronchitis, or bronchiolitis); 622 patient records met the criteria and were reviewed. General characteristics of the study population and the military hospital, as well as the method used for classifying clinical diagnoses of acute LTRI, are available in the Technical Appendix.

Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from 207 (33.3%) of the 622 patients with an acute LTRI. Within 3 days, the specimens were tested (GClabs, Yongin-si, South Korea) for 12 respiratory viruses by multiplex reverse transcription PCR; methods are described in the Technical Appendix. Respiratory virus infections were confirmed for 87 (42.0%) patients: adenovirus (55 [63.2%] patients), influenza A virus (26 [29.9%] patients), influenza B virus (4 [4.6%] patients), rhinovirus group A (3 [3.4%] patients), and parainfluenza virus (2 [2.3%] patients). Co-infection with adenovirus and rhinovirus group A was observed in 3 patients. For all confirmed cases of viral infection, we performed an epidemiologic analysis and analyzed the clinical manifestations and prognosis for the hospitalized patients.

METHODS

Study Design and Data Sources

KID, NIS, and NEDS provide nationally representative data on > 7 million pediatric hospitalizations, 35 million hospitalizations, and 145 million ED visits in the US (all sample-weighted numbers) and also include a comprehensive set of sociodemographic variables such as chronological age, insurance payer status, and race/ethnicity. NIS and NEDS 2011–2019 data were the primary datasets in this study; 2019 was the most recent data release. KID data are available every 3 years; 2009, 2012, 2016, and 2019 data were used to confirm NIS results.

The US infant births from 2011 through 2019 were obtained from the birth cohort data of the National Center for Health Statistics and National Vital Statistics System. Live births were used as the denominator of hospitalization and ED visit rates.

This study followed HCUP's data use agreement procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of patients, physicians, and healthcare institutions in the US. Sample sizes ≤ 10 were not reported. All data were de-identified and thus exempt from federal regulations for the protection of human research participants.

Study Population

The unit of analysis was infant (< 1 year) hospitalizations or ED visits. RSV was defined by at least 1 of the following diagnostic codes: RSV (International Classification of Diseases [ICD], Ninth Revision [ICD-9]: 079.6; ICD, Tenth Revision [ICD-10]: B97.4); pneumonia due to RSV (ICD-9: 480.1; ICD-10: J12.1); acute bronchiolitis due to RSV (ICD-9: 466.11; ICD-10: J21.0); and acute bronchitis due to RSV (ICD-10: J20.5). Bronchiolitis was considered to be an upper estimate of RSV because laboratory testing of RSV is not broadly recommended and included all RSV codes as well as unspecified bronchiolitis (ICD-9: 079.6, 466.11, 466.19, 480.1; ICD-10: B97.4, J12.1, J20.5, J21.0, J21.8, J21.9).

All newborn birth hospitalizations, the most common reason for inpatient hospital stays among infants, were excluded by ICD-9 (V30.XX–V39.XX) and ICD-10 codes (Z38.XX), to describe community-acquired RSV and bronchiolitis in infants.

### Substantial health and economic burden of COVID-19 during the year after acute illness among US adults not at high risk of severe COVID-19 [^f86cea98]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The top 500 ICD-10 diagnosis codes were analyzed by ICD-10 code chapter (a system of organization based on the most affected organ systems or types of injury/disease), and medications were categorized according to Uniform System of Classification class. All diagnosis and medication categories applicable to < 2% of the overall population during the baseline phase were excluded from analysis. The "biologics" category was also excluded based on incomplete data capture. Standard medical cost means, standard deviations, medians, and quartiles were calculated using the number of patients with a related visit or service, and nonzero costs were calculated using the number of patients with a cost > 0 associated with that visit or service. No adjustments were made for patients who died during the 12-month post-acute phase; all deaths that occurred during the post-acute phase were accounted for and reported. Absolute and relative change from baseline to the post-acute phase were calculated for each outcome where possible using frequency counts. To better understand the relationship between post-acute outcomes and initial infection severity, all data were presented for the overall population and stratified by patient disposition during the acute phase of COVID-19 (within 30 days after diagnosis): not hospitalized, hospitalized without intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or admitted to the ICU. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS, Cary, NC), and no statistical inference tests were conducted.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Clinical overview… [^7f7e6190]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Overview Human parainfluenza viruses belong to the Paramyxoviridae family. They are enveloped RNA viruses. There are four types and two subtypes of HPIVs. The clinical and epidemiological features for each HPIV type can sometimes vary. In the United States, infections associated with HPIV-1 usually peak every other year. So do infections with HPIV-2, every other year during the years when HPIV-1 is low. HPIV-3 usually has peaks annually, particularly when HPIV-1 and HPIV-2 are low. Infections with HPIV-4 are less well-defined but appear to occur yearly. HPIVs commonly infect infants and young children and persons with weakened immune systems. However, anyone can get HPIV infection. Symptoms and Illnesses The incubation period, the time from getting infected with HPIV to onset of symptoms, is generally 2 to 6 days. HPIV-1and HPIV-2are most often associated with croup, with HPIV-1 most often identified as the cause in children.

Both can also cause upper and lower respiratory illness, and cold-like symptoms. HPIV-3is more often associated with bronchiolitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. HPIV-4is recognized less often but may cause mild to severe respiratory tract illnesses. Upper respiratory illness from any HPIV is generally common cold symptoms. Signs and symptoms may include:

- fever
- runny nose
- cough
- sneezing
- **sore throat Other symptoms of HPIV illness may include**:
- ear pain
- irritability
- decreased appetite HPIVs can also cause more serious illness. Clinical syndromes in children include:

- croup, windpipe and sometimes into the bronchial tubes
- bronchitis
- bronchiolitis.
- **pneumonia Symptoms of more serious illness may include**:
- barking cough
- hoarseness
- stridor
- wheezing In adults, upper respiratory infections and bronchitis are the most common illnesses caused by HPIVs; signs and symptoms may include fever, runny nose, cough, and sore throat. Pneumonia may occur, especially in older adults and people with weakened immune systems. Reinfection People can get multiple HPIV infections in their lifetime. These reinfections usually cause mild upper respiratory tract illness with cold-like symptoms. However, reinfections can cause serious lower respiratory tract illness, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis in some people. Older adults and people with weakened immune systems have a higher risk for severe infections. Most children 5 years of age and older have antibodies against HPIV-3 and approximately 75% have antibodies against HPIV-1 and HPIV-2.

Transmission HPIVs usually spread by direct contact with infectious droplets or by airborne spread when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. HPIVs may remain infectious in airborne droplets for over an hour and on surfaces for a few hours depending on environmental conditions. People are most contagious during the early stage of illness. People usually get HPIV infection in the spring, summer, and fall. However, it is possible to get infected at any time of the year. For more information, see HPIV Seasons. Prevention and Treatment Currently, there is no vaccine to prevent HPIV infection. However, researchers are trying to develop vaccines. Also, there is no specific antiviral treatment for HPIV illness. Most HPIV illnesses are mild and typically require only treatment of symptoms. In hospital settings, healthcare providers should follow contact precautions, such as handwashing and wearing protective gowns and gloves.

### The evolving burden of viruses in pneumonia [^5a1f6b3d]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To describe the evolving microbiology of various forms of pneumonia and the importance of viruses as etiologic causes of pneumonia.

Recent Findings

Multiple studies utilizing novel diagnostic modalities demonstrate that the prevalence of viruses as causes for pneumonia varies from approximately 10–30% depending on the specific pneumonia type evaluated. Viral pneumonias appear similar in presentation and severity of illness to bacterial causes of pulmonary infection. Clinical criteria do not reliably allow the differentiation of viral from bacterial causes in pneumonia.

Summary

Viruses represent a pool of important culprit organisms in pneumonia and identification of a viral pathogen may facilitate attempts at antibiotic stewardship.

### Characterizing pediatric aspiration pneumonia: diagnostic gaps and stewardship opportunities [^1b72e7ec]. Hospital Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause for hospitalization, especially in children with medical complexity, yet there are no standard definition or clinical practice guidelines for the condition. Our objectives were to assess the validity of the aspiration pneumonia billing code and to describe the demographics, presenting symptoms, diagnostic results, and outcomes of children hospitalized with this condition.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 200 patients hospitalized with an International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10) diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia from 2016 to 2021. We conducted a standardized medical record review to identify children with a clinician diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia and collected data on patient and hospitalization characteristics across 4 subgroups defined by a combination of clinical and radiographic features.

Results

Among 200 patients identified by ICD-10 code, 138 (69%) also had a clinician diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia. For these 138 patients, the mean age was 8.4 years (SD, 7), and most had an underlying medical complexity. Diagnostic testing, antibiotic selection, and hospitalization outcomes were similar across definition subgroups. Only 18 patients (13%) had aspiration risk factors, fever, and a probable focal opacity on chest imaging at diagnosis.

Conclusions

We observed significant variability in presenting symptoms and diagnostic testing results among patients assigned a clinician diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia. Our study underscores the need for a standardized clinical definition, improved diagnostic criteria, and evidence-based treatment guidelines to optimize clinical care for this patient population.

### International classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification for the pulmonary, critical care, and sleep physician [^d06e16db]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

After a patient encounter, the physician uses two coding systems to bill for the service rendered to the patient. The Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code is used to describe the encounter or procedure. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code is used to describe the diagnosis(es) of the patient. On October 1, 2015, ICD-9-CM coding will end, and all physicians will be required to use a new diagnostic coding system, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). This article describes the new diagnostic coding system and how it differs from the old system. There are resources and costs involved for physicians and physician practices to prepare properly for ICD-10-CM. Similar to other important events, the more thorough the preparation, the more likely a positive outcome will occur. Resource use is very important in preparation for the transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM. Greater familiarity with ICD-10-CM plus a thorough, effective preparation will lead to reduced costs and a smooth transition. Coding descriptor changes and additional codes occur in ICD-10-CM for chronic bronchitis and emphysema, asthma, and respiratory failure. These changes will affect the coding of these diseases and disorders by physicians. Because the number of codes will increase more than fivefold, the complexity of documentation to support ICD-10-CM will increase substantially. The documentation in the patient's chart to support the ICD-10-CM codes used will need to be enhanced. The requirement for accurate and comprehensive documentation cannot be emphasized enough. All of the coding and documentation changes will be a challenge to pulmonary, critical care, and sleep physicians. They must be prepared fully when ICD-10-CM coding begins and ICD-9-CM coding stops abruptly on October 1, 2015.

Directions for future clinical trials for RVIs — trial timing, design, and endpoints are specified for evaluating therapies. The framework includes "the optimal time for intervention (72 to 96 hours) after the onset of upper respiratory tract symptoms" and "the incorporation of adaptive randomization with multiarm, multistage designs." Designs that "compare different interventions with a common control could improve enrollment during a predetermined period within the same season," and the primary endpoint "should focus on progression to LRTI, severe lower respiratory tract complications, return to room air, or changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second," as clinically relevant measures.

### Respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus respiratory hospitalizations and outcomes in Colorado adults ≥ 50 years of age: 2016–2023 [^99cc718a]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Multiplex testing of viral nucleic acid in respiratory specimens has become more ubiquitous in Colorado hospitals in recent years, used mostly for the detection of influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) for which treatments are available and detection of these 2 viruses is often coupled or triple-plexed with RSV. The lower number of HMPV cases identified might be due to the lower number of patients being tested for HMPV. The changing of medical coding of medical encounters for billing purposes, from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) to International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) (which includes direct codes for HMPV) in the United States in 2015–2016, and access to the Colorado Hospital Association (CHA) administrative database allowed us to address the relative lacuna of population-based studies of HMPV in the older adult population. As this database does not include laboratory testing data, RSV and HMPV infections were identified using coded diagnosis only.

In this study, we used data from the 93 hospitals in Colorado that contribute billing data to the CHA database, as a first step in determining the hospital-based burden of these respiratory infections in Colorado. The aim was to determine demographic and comorbid factors affecting outcomes associated with HMPV and RSV hospitalizations. These outcomes assessed the risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality among HMPV- and RSV-infected hospitalized patients and the impact of demographic and underlying comorbidities on these outcomes. Length of hospitalization stay was assessed in a secondary analysis.

### Host and environmental determinants of in-hospital mortality in community-acquired pneumonia: evidence of seasonality, socioeconomic factors, and hospital differentiation in Portugal [^6ca3cd95]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study employs a retrospective cross-sectional design to analyze hospitalizations due to CAP in mainland Portugal from 2010 to 2018.

Data collection

Data was sourced from the National Hospital Discharge Database (NHDD), which provides comprehensive information on NHS hospitalization episodes, including patient demographics, diagnoses (primary and secondary), and procedures performed and discharge outcomes.

Two ecological variables were examined (early school leaving rate and unemployment rate), based on the national definitions provided by Statistics Portugal and data collected from the 2011 National Census. Patients were classified according to the values of these variables reported in the 2011 Census for the respective parish of residence, using them as proxies for socioeconomic status.

The subjects' anonymity was strictly maintained, as the dataset did not include any personal identifiable information. Hospitalization records contain a randomly generated identifier, ensuring patient confidentiality. Consequently, informed consent was not required. The Ethics Committee of the Lisbon Faculty of Medicine approved the study (No:15/23).

Inclusion criteria

The study included all hospitalization episodes with a primary diagnosis of CAP, present on admission. The primary diagnosis is defined as the condition determined, after evaluation, to be the principal reason for the patient's admission to the hospital. Cases were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes 480–486, and since 2017 the 10 th Revision, Clinical Modification/Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-CM/PCS) codes J12–J18.9, B25.0, A37.91, A22.1, B44.0, and A48.1. The ICD-9-CM codes 487.0 and 488.11 for influenza pneumonia, along with their corresponding ICD-10-CM/PCS codes, were not included because the systematic investigation of influenza viruses was not conducted uniformly throughout the analysis period or consistently across all hospitals. The same criterion was applied in a previous publication by our group, enabling comparison.

### Trends in pneumonia mortality rates and hospitalizations by organism, United States, 2002–2011 (1) [^93502f21]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The Study

In a retrospective cohort study, we examined hospitalizations of pneumonia patients using discharge data from the publicly available Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. The University of Louisville Institutional Review Board did not require a review because the project did not meet the common rule definition of human subjects' research. We completed Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Data Use Agreement Training.

The study included patients > 18 years of age discharged with a principal diagnosis of pneumonia according to standards of the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). We also included those with a principal diagnosis of sepsis or respiratory failure and a secondary diagnosis of pneumonia. Only ICD-9-CM codes for which the numbers of an organism were substantial were analyzed: pneumococci, Klebsiella spp. Pseudomonas spp. Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and influenza virus. We followed US Census Bureau definitions in classifying cases by US region.

The NIS database contains an ≈20% stratified sample of US community hospitals. From that sample, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality calculated national estimates by weighting each discharge on the basis of hospital location, teaching status, bed number, and ownership control, relative to all US hospitals, which permitted us to estimate the number of US hospitalizations. For each patient discharged, we recorded age, sex, region, principal and secondary diagnoses (up to 15), and whether patient had died from any cause. Population estimates were obtained from the US Census Bureau.

Primary outcomes were temporal trends in hospitalization and case-fatality rates for pneumonia based on infecting organism as determined by ICD-9 coding. We then calculated the rate for hospitalizations caused by each organism using the number of hospitalizations from the NIS database as the numerator and US Census Bureau population estimates as the denominator. Discharge codes do not specify where the pneumonia was acquired, and although hospitalization rate was used, this does not necessarily indicate community-acquired cases. We calculated the all-cause case-fatality rate for each organism similarly, using the number of deaths.

### Pneumonia in infancy and risk for asthma: the role of familial confounding and pneumococcal vaccination [^7e444eb5]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

We assessed effect modification from PCV immunization, as nationwide PCV immunization of children was introduced during the study period, which has likely changed the etiology of pediatric pneumonia. Children born in the PCV period had a slightly increased risk for asthma if diagnosed with pneumonia in infancy compared with those born in the pre-PCV period. This supports the hypothesis that viral pneumonia is more strongly associated with asthma and that the absolute risk for asthma in children experiencing pneumonia in infancy is somewhat higher today, potentially owing to the relative increase in viral etiology of childhood pneumonia. Further supporting this hypothesis was an observed relative increase in viral pneumonia diagnosis codes in the PCV period compared with the pre-PCV period and higher point estimates when restricting the exposure definition to only include viral pneumonia diagnosis codes in a sensitivity analysis. However, specific ICD-10 codes should be interpreted cautiously as pneumonia etiology is hard to establish in children, and coding practices might change over time. As an alternative approach, we compared children diagnosed with pneumonia during and outside the respiratory infections season but observed only minor differences in the point estimates. Of note, we observed an overall lower asthma prevalence in children born in the PCV period compared with those born in the pre-PCV period. This raises questions about a potential asthma-reducing effect of PCV, although this topic is beyond the scope of the current study.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for influenza virus infection, more specifically with respect to indications for testing, flu season, outpatients and ED patients, IDSA 2018 guidelines recommend to consider testing for influenza in patients who are not at high risk for influenza complications and present with influenza-like illness, pneumonia, or nonspecific respiratory illness (such as cough without fever), in the following clinical situations:

- results might influence antiviral treatment decisions

- results might reduce use of unnecessary antibiotics or further diagnostic testing

- results might reduce time in the emergency department

- results might influence antiviral treatment or chemoprophylaxis decisions for high-risk household contacts.

### Trends in infectious disease mortality rates, Spain, 1980–2011 [^d4557f9f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

In Spain, the source of mortality rate statistics is the medical death certificate, a compulsory administrative document that is completed by the physician who certifies the death. Data are subsequently forwarded to the regional mortality registries where causes of death are coded according to ICD guidelines. According to World Health Organization recommendations, the cause of death that is ICD coded should be taken as the underlying cause of death.

We analyzed ICD codes of underlying causes of death provided by the Spanish National Statistics Institute (NSI). We selected deaths caused by infectious causes corresponding to ICD-9 codes for 1980–1998 and ICD-10 codes for 1999–2011. From the ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, we selected all codes of infectious and parasitic diseases and other infectious causes from remaining groupings (Table 1). Of these diseases, 10 that accounted for > 90% of all deaths (pneumonia, septicemia, cardiac infections, AIDS and HIV infection, renal infections, tuberculosis, acute respiratory infection, influenza, viral hepatitis, and intestinal infections) were independently selected. For HIV/AIDS, data collection began in 1989 when a newly created specific ICD-9 code was assigned and began to be used in Spain; related diseases were previously allocated to unspecified immunity disorders.
