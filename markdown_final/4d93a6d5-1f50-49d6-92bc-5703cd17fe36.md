## Question

Can results of an expired Covid test be trusted?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether results from an expired COVID-19 test can be trusted and what to do if the only available kit is expired. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA's position on using tests beyond their expiration date. Then, I should verify whether expiration dates can be extended and how to check that. Next, I will examine the clinical implications of using an expired test, including the risk of false results. After that, I should review best-practice testing algorithms if an expired test must be used. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and confirm any exceptions or special circumstances.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory stance, because I need to ensure I'm not overinterpreting anecdotal advice. The FDA explicitly advises that at-home COVID-19 diagnostic tests should not be used beyond their authorized expiration date, because test components can degrade over time and lead to inaccurate or invalid results, so the baseline recommendation is that expired tests should not be trusted for clinical decision-making [^117Szk1X].

> Wait, let me verify the nuance about expiration extensions before I jump to conclusions. Some manufacturers' expiration dates have been extended as additional stability data become available, and the FDA maintains a public list where consumers can check whether a specific test lot has a revised expiration date beyond what is printed on the box; if the expiration has been officially extended, the test is considered valid through the revised date, but if it has not been extended, it remains expired and should not be used [^117Szk1X] [^112u7EDT].

> I will now examine the clinical implications of using an expired test, and I need to ensure I separate theoretical from evidence-based risks. Degradation of reagents can reduce analytical sensitivity and specificity, increase invalid or indeterminate readouts, and undermine quality control, which means both false negatives and false positives become more likely; importantly, even with valid, in-date antigen tests, negative results already carry a meaningful false-negative risk that is higher early in infection or in asymptomatic users, so adding expired-kit uncertainty compounds that problem and can provide false reassurance or misdirect care [^112EuZRB] [^113RPrGv] [^117Szk1X].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about what to do if only an expired kit is available; I should double-check the recommended testing algorithms. If no valid test is available and an expired antigen test is used as a last resort, a positive result is more likely to be a true positive given the high specificity of EUA antigen assays, but it should still be confirmed with a standard NAAT when feasible; a negative result from an expired antigen test is particularly unreliable and should prompt repeat testing with a valid test as soon as possible, ideally with a molecular assay if suspicion remains, consistent with FDA advice to repeat antigen testing after negatives and IDSA guidance to confirm negative antigen results when clinical suspicion is moderate to high [^113RPrGv] [^112EuZRB] [^114ukcbC].

> Let me consider special circumstances and edge cases, and I should confirm whether any guideline carves out an exception for expired tests. I find no guideline endorsing the routine use of expired COVID-19 tests; even in resource-limited settings, the recommended approach is to prioritize access to valid testing rather than to validate degraded kits, and while repeat antigen testing can improve sensitivity when properly timed, that strategy presumes in-date tests and does not mitigate the unpredictable performance of expired reagents [^117Szk1X] [^113RPrGv].

> Synthesis and recommendation: I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and actionable. No, results from an expired COVID-19 test cannot be trusted for clinical decision-making; if the expiration date has been officially extended by the FDA for that specific lot, then the revised date applies and the test is valid, but otherwise expired tests should be discarded and replaced with a valid antigen or molecular test, with negative antigen results repeated per FDA labeling and confirmed by NAAT when clinical suspicion remains high [^117Szk1X] [^112u7EDT] [^113RPrGv] [^112EuZRB].

Expired COVID-19 tests are **not reliable** because reagents degrade over time [^117Szk1X], reducing accuracy and increasing the risk of false results [^117Szk1X]. The FDA advises **not to use tests past their expiration date** unless the date has been officially extended [^117Szk1X]. If an expired test is used, a positive result may still be meaningful, but a negative result is unreliable and should be confirmed with a valid test [^112EuZRB]. Always check for an updated expiration date on the FDA website before use [^112u7EDT].

---

## Reliability of expired COVID-19 tests

Expired COVID-19 tests are **less reliable** because reagents degrade over time [^117Szk1X], reducing accuracy and increasing the risk of false results [^117Szk1X]. The FDA advises **not to use tests past their expiration date** unless the date has been officially extended [^117Szk1X]. If an expired test is used, a positive result may still be meaningful, but a negative result is unreliable and should be confirmed with a valid test [^notfound]. Always check for an updated expiration date on the FDA website before use [^112u7EDT].

---

## FDA guidelines on expired COVID-19 tests

The FDA provides **clear guidance** on the use of expired COVID-19 tests:

- **Expiration dates**: COVID-19 tests have expiration dates based on stability studies. These dates may be extended as additional stability data become available [^117Szk1X].

- **Extended expiration dates**: The FDA maintains a list of authorized at-home COVID-19 diagnostic tests with updated expiration dates. Consumers should check this list before using expired tests [^117Szk1X].

- **Recommendation**: The FDA does not recommend using COVID-19 tests beyond their authorized expiration dates unless the expiration date has been officially extended [^117Szk1X].

---

## Risks associated with using expired COVID-19 tests

Using expired COVID-19 tests poses several **risks**:

- **False negatives**: Degraded reagents may fail to detect the virus, leading to false-negative results and potentially facilitating the spread of COVID-19 [^117Szk1X].

- **False positives**: Although less common, expired tests may also yield false-positive results, causing unnecessary anxiety and inappropriate medical decisions [^117Szk1X].

- **Invalid results**: Expired tests may produce invalid or inconclusive results, necessitating repeat testing and delaying appropriate medical care [^117Szk1X].

---

## Accuracy of expired COVID-19 tests

The accuracy of expired COVID-19 tests **varies** with storage conditions, test type, and the extent of reagent degradation. Generally, expired tests have **lower sensitivity and specificity** than non-expired tests, increasing the likelihood of false results [^112EuZRB].

---

## Situations where expired tests may still be useful

In certain situations, expired COVID-19 tests **may still be useful**, such as when no non-expired tests are available and immediate testing is critical. In such cases, a positive result from an expired test may still be informative, but a negative result should be confirmed with a valid test [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Expired COVID-19 tests are **generally less reliable** due to reagent degradation, which increases the risk of false results. The FDA advises against using expired tests unless the expiration date has been officially extended [^117Szk1X]. If an expired test is used, interpret results cautiously: confirm negative results with a valid test and consider a positive result as preliminary until confirmed [^117Szk1X]. Always check the FDA's list of authorized tests for updated expiration dates before using expired tests [^112u7EDT].

### Interpreting COVID-19 test results in clinical settings: It depends! [^114zC79e]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Tests for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are intended for a disparate and shifting range of purposes: (1) diagnosing patients who present with symptoms to inform individual treatment decisions; (2) organizational uses such as "cohorting" potentially infected patients and staff to protect others; and (3) contact tracing, surveillance, and other public health purposes. Often lost when testing is encouraged is that testing does not by itself confer health benefits. Rather, testing is useful to the extent it forms a critical link to subsequent medical or public health interventions. Such interventions might be individual level, like better diagnosis, treatment, isolation, or quarantine of contacts. They might aid surveillance to understand levels and trends of disease within a defined population that enables informed decisions to implement or relax social distancing measures. In this article, we describe the range of available COVID-19 tests; their accuracy and timing considerations; and the specific clinical, organizational, and public health considerations that warrant different testing strategies. Three representative clinical scenarios illustrate the importance of appropriate test use and interpretation. The reason a patient seeks testing is often a strong indicator of the pretest probability of infection, and thus how to interpret test results. In addition, the level of population spread of the virus and the timing of testing play critical roles in the positive or negative predictive value of the test. We conclude with practical recommendations regarding the need for testing in various contexts, appropriate tests and testing methods, and the interpretation of test results.

Antigen testing versus no testing in asymptomatic exposed individuals — IDSA recommendation and key remarks: For asymptomatic individuals with known exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) panel suggests using a single (ie, one-time) antigen (Ag) test over no testing in specific situations (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence). Testing in the absence of COVID-19–like symptoms should be individualized, and one-time Ag testing may be considered if the test result will impact an individual's subsequent actions. A negative Ag test result reduces the likelihood of infection, but the longer the time since testing, the more this likelihood reduction wanes; in contrast, a positive test result is associated with a high positive-predictive value. The panel recognizes the lack of evidence supporting therapy in asymptomatic persons and the absence of treatments approved through EUA for asymptomatic COVID-19 but acknowledges that individual clinical scenarios may lead clinicians toward testing and consideration of treatment.

Antigen testing in asymptomatic individuals — modeled outcomes and practical considerations: With a 10% prevalence of infection, 63 true positives (95% CI: 56–69) and 37 false negatives (95% CI: 31–44) were detected, and the number of false-positive results was estimated to be 0 with a true prevalence between 1% and 10%; routine confirmation of positive Ag test results does not appear to be necessary in most cases. Additional considerations include that there are currently no treatment options approved through FDA EUA for asymptomatic COVID-19, the panel found no direct evidence that testing for SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic individuals reduces risk of transmission, postexposure monoclonal antibody prophylaxis may be an alternative to testing in high-risk asymptomatic individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 if and when EUA options exist, and education on interpretation of rapid Ag tests is important; the decision to pursue rapid Ag testing versus no testing should be individualized, and antigen testing may be useful in guiding mitigation efforts during an outbreak.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) molecular COVID-19 diagnostic testing guideline — SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) include laboratory-based, rapid, point-of-care, and over-the-counter home tests and are available in most areas of the US; most tests received emergency use authorization (EUA), with only one molecular assay granted a de novo, 510(k) clearance. Despite EUA status, NAATs have demonstrated high accuracy and reproducibility. The Department of Health and Human Services planned for the federal COVID-19 Public Health Emergency to expire on May 11, 2023, but there was no similar declaration to terminate the independent EUA for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests and it was expected the EUA would remain in effect after that date; if the EUA is terminated, advance notice will be published in the federal register to start the transition to normal operations.

IDSA COVID-19 diagnostics — antigen testing versus standard NAAT in asymptomatic exposure: For asymptomatic individuals with known exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the IDSA panel suggests using a single standard NAAT (ie, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT) over a single rapid Ag test (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence). SARS-CoV-2 testing in the absence of COVID-19–like symptoms should be individualized. A one-time standard NAAT may be considered if the test result will impact an individual's subsequent actions. Access to timely results of standard NAAT may be unavailable or limited in some settings; in such situations, use of an Ag test can be considered. The panel recognizes the lack of evidence supporting COVID-19 therapy in asymptomatic persons and the absence of treatments approved through FDA EUA for asymptomatic COVID-19 but acknowledges that individual clinical decisions may need to be made and discussed with patients.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen testing — clinical interpretation and research needs in symptomatic individuals: Positive Ag tests in symptomatic individuals have a high positive-predictive value for COVID-19 and can be used to help guide decision making about treatment and isolation of patients, consistent with local public health guidance. Negative Ag tests in symptomatic individuals do not rule out infection; individuals with a negative Ag test result who remain symptomatic and for whom an alternative diagnosis has not been established should undergo prompt testing for SARS-CoV-2 using standard NAAT. The panel identified a few studies that reported better positive percent agreement between Ag testing and viral culture than between standard NAAT and viral culture but identified no empirical evidence that informed the question of whether Ag test results predict infectiousness, as measured by transmission; further, the IDSA panel found no empirical evidence to support the use of Ag test results to guide release of patients with COVID-19 from isolation.

### Interpreting SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests: common questions and answers [^111kqqBc]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The spectrum of asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission presents challenges for evaluating SARS-CoV-2 test performance for diagnostic or screening purposes and for interpreting test results. Molecular and antigen tests can detect current SARS-CoV-2 infection and are used to diagnose COVID-19. Clinicians should consider a test's characteristics, test timing in relation to symptom onset, and the pretest probability of disease when interpreting results. Molecular and antigen SARS-CoV-2 tests both have high specificity. However, antigen tests generally have lower sensitivity and thus greater potential for false-negative results. Pretest probability of disease should be based on a patient's exposure to someone with a confirmed or probable case, signs or symptoms of COVID-19, local or population-specific COVID-19 prevalence, and presence of an alternative diagnosis. Using a leaf plot is an efficient way to visualize posttest probability of disease based on estimated pretest probability and the test's sensitivity and specificity. A negative molecular or antigen test result might not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection when pretest probability is high, depending on the test's sensitivity. A symptom-based approach is preferred over a test-based approach for discontinuing isolation precautions for most patients with COVID-19 because prolonged shedding of viral RNA does not necessarily correlate with infectivity. Antibody tests might help identify past SARS-CoV-2 infection if performed two to four weeks after symptom onset; however, because of uncertainty about the extent and durability of postinfection or vaccine-induced immunity, they should not yet be used to infer immunity or guide discontinuation of personal protective measures.

### Challenges and controversies to testing for COVID-19 [^112ggqUr]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has placed the clinical laboratory and testing for SARS-CoV-2 front and center in the worldwide discussion of how to end the outbreak. Clinical laboratories have responded by developing, validating, and implementing a variety of molecular and serologic assays to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This has played an essential role in identifying cases, informing isolation decisions, and helping to curb the spread of disease. However, as the demand for COVID-19 testing has increased, laboratory professionals have faced a growing list of challenges, uncertainties, and, in some situations, controversy, as they have attempted to balance the need for increasing test capacity with maintaining a high-quality laboratory operation. The emergence of this new viral pathogen has raised unique diagnostic questions for which there have not always been straightforward answers. In this commentary, the author addresses several areas of current debate, including (i) the role of molecular assays in defining the duration of isolation/quarantine, (ii) whether the PCR cycle threshold value should be included on patient reports, (iii) if specimen pooling and testing by research staff represent acceptable solutions to expand screening, and (iv) whether testing a large percentage of the population is feasible and represents a viable strategy to end the pandemic.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular testing — conclusions and research needs state coordination and priority settings for asymptomatic exposed individuals, specifying that "Testing in asymptomatic subjects with known or suspected exposures should be coordinated with local public health officials", and this is "especially important in situations where knowledge of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infection is essential for determining medical follow-up, defining risks for other vulnerable individuals in a household, congregate setting or hospital"; it further notes "Special consideration should also be given to healthcare personnel exposed without appropriate PPE in healthcare settings", and calls for "Comparative studies (preferably randomized controlled trials) along with cost-effectiveness analyses of testing strategies in asymptomatic populations", "Studies on the ideal time and collection method", and clarification of "what constitutes an exposure that would justify testing"; it adds that whether early diagnosis changes outcomes "is unknown", though "the opportunity for therapeutic intervention might justify screening exposed individuals", with benefits that "might vary depending on underlying diseases, immune status, age, and vaccination status… and their prior history of COVID-19 infection".

IDSA COVID-19 antigen (Ag) testing — false positives and confirmatory testing: Given the high specificity of EUA rapid Ag tests, routine confirmation of positive test results is not usually necessary; positive results can be used immediately to help guide treatment, isolation, and quarantine decisions. Even when the pretest probability or prevalence is low (ie, 1%), the expected number of false-positive Ag results is very small, on the order of 0–10 false-positive results per 1000 individuals tested, and confirmation of positive Ag test results may be considered rarely on a case-by-case basis when the pretest probability or prevalence of infection is very low (ie, < 1%) and/or if the impact of a potential false-positive result is deemed to be significant and detrimental. Concerns about false-positive Ag results were not borne out in the medical literature.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular testing — NAAT in asymptomatic exposed individuals: For individuals who have clinical or epidemiologic reasons that might make testing desirable, the IDSA panel suggests SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing in asymptomatic individuals who are either known or suspected to have been exposed to COVID-19 (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence). The panel recognizes the lack of evidence supporting therapy for asymptomatic persons and the absence of treatment approved through EUA for asymptomatic COVID-19, and notes that high-risk individuals (e.g., those who have pulmonary conditions or are immunocompromised or those in close contact with immunocompromised individuals) may be considered for testing. Testing should be done at least 5 days after the exposure, and if symptoms develop before 5 days, the exposed individual should get tested immediately.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^1152B3P6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — first 2 weeks after symptom onset: The IDSA panel recommends against using serologic testing to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first 2 weeks following symptom onset (strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence). Most studies included in this recommendation's literature review assessed unvaccinated individuals and so the panel's findings might not apply to individuals who have been vaccinated, especially with respect to specificity, rendering test accuracy worse than presented. Similarly, in today's population there is a higher likelihood of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection than assessed in the included studies, which could also negatively affect specificity, rendering test accuracy worse than presented. Analogous to other respiratory viruses where nonserologic tests are preferred for diagnosis of acute infection, serologic testing should not be performed routinely for diagnosis of acute COVID-19.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing guideline — risk of bias, certainty assessment, and recommendation wording specifies that the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Studies-2 revised tool assessed risk of bias for test accuracy studies, and the Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions was used for other intervention evidence. Overall certainty was assessed using the GRADE framework across risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias, with GRADE summary of findings tables developed in GRADEpro. Recommendations were labeled as "strong" or "conditional"; the words "we recommend" indicate strong recommendations and "we suggest" indicate conditional recommendations. For all recommendations, expert panelists reached consensus with voting rules if consensus could not be reached, and when comparators were not formally stated the comparison was implicitly "not using the test"; some recommendations acknowledged a "knowledge gap" to avoid premature favorable recommendations and rapid diffusion of potentially nonuseful tests.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen testing — key remarks for symptomatic testing: "Symptomatic individuals were defined as those with at least 1 of the common symptoms of COVID-19". "For optimal performance, Ag tests should be performed within 5 days of symptom onset". "If clinical suspicion for COVID-19 remains high, a negative Ag result should be confirmed by standard NAAT (ie, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT)". "A single Ag test has high specificity; a positive result can be used to guide treatment and isolation decisions without confirmation". "There were limited data regarding the analytical performance of Ag tests in children, immunocompromised or vaccinated".

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: antigen testing (January 2023) [^113wUPji]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

COVID-19 antigen (Ag) testing — benefits and harms of unobserved self-collection: The potential benefit of unobserved Ag testing is that tests are readily available, and testing may be more likely to be performed and performed faster than if observed testing needed to be arranged, which may particularly benefit individuals without convenient access to a testing facility or those who prefer to avoid healthcare facilities. Observed testing adds cost to patient care. The potential harm of Ag testing is the risk of a false-negative result, which can provide false assurance and facilitate spread, and in symptomatic infected persons may result in failure to treat; harms may be mitigated by clear instructions and understanding that a negative test does not rule out infection and should prompt follow-up testing.

### When should asymptomatic persons Be tested for COVID-19? [^117BobBx]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

On 24 August 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its website to highlight that asymptomatic individuals, even those with exposure to a COVID-19-positive contact, do not necessarily need to be tested unless they have medical conditions associated with increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19. The CDC subsequently updated its guidance on 19 September 2020 to support testing of asymptomatic persons, including close contacts of persons with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this editorial, the American Society for Microbiology Clinical and Public Health Microbiology Committee's Subcommittee on Laboratory Practices comments on testing of asymptomatic individuals relative to current medical knowledge of the virus and mitigation measures. Specific points are provided concerning such testing when undertaking contact tracing and routine surveillance. Limitations to consider when testing asymptomatic persons are covered, including the need to prioritize testing of contacts of positive COVID-19 cases. We urge the CDC to consult with primary stakeholders of COVID-19 testing when making such impactful changes in testing guidance.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing — Recommendation 6 states that for individuals who have clinical or epidemiologic reasons that might make testing desirable, the IDSA panel suggests SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing in asymptomatic individuals who are either known or suspected to have been exposed to COVID-19 (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence). Remarks note limited evidence and no EUA-approved therapy for asymptomatic COVID-19 but allow that individual clinical scenarios may lead clinicians toward testing and consideration of treatment, and individuals with high-risk conditions or in close contact with immunocompromised individuals may be considered for testing. Testing should be done at least 5 days after the exposure, and if symptoms develop before 5 days the exposed individual should get tested immediately. Known exposures are defined as close contact for at least 15 minutes over a 24-hour period with someone with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, while suspected exposures may include working or residing in congregate settings experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak. The decision to test asymptomatic persons should depend on availability of testing resources, knowledge of infection can inform appropriate isolation, risk varies by exposure conditions with household contacts especially high-risk, and the recommendation assumes the exposed individual was not wearing appropriate PPE.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen testing — symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19: Recommendation 2 states the IDSA panel suggests using standard NAAT (ie, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT) over a rapid Ag test (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence). If standard NAAT is not available or results are expected to be delayed more than 1 day, the IDSA panel suggests using a rapid Ag test over standard NAAT. For optimal performance, Ag tests should be used within 5 days of symptom onset; the panel was unable to identify any study that reported results of Ag testing within 2 days of symptom onset. The panel was unable to identify studies comparing the risk of transmission among patients recovering from COVID-19 who were released from isolation based on results of Ag testing versus results of standard NAAT.

Recommendation 9: NAAT in asymptomatic individuals undergoing procedures — The IDSA panel suggests against routine SARS-CoV-2 NAAT of asymptomatic individuals without a known exposure to COVID-19 who are undergoing a medical or surgical procedure (conditional recommendation, very low certainty evidence). Remarks note that NAAT is used to determine presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which may not represent infectious virus, and that detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory specimens without evidence of infectious virus has been reported widely; the panel concluded that data were insufficient to establish SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness based on non-standardized instrument signal values, such as cycle threshold (Ct) values; and decisions on timing of a procedure in a patient with prior SARS CoV-2 infection must balance the risk to the patient against the risks of delaying or avoiding the planned procedure and should consider patient-related factors (e.g., vaccination status, symptomatic status, age).

Antigen testing in asymptomatic exposed individuals — benefits and harms: The panel placed high value on minimizing the number of false-negative results, especially in higher-risk healthcare settings, and found no evidence that the use of Ag tests reduces transmission of SARS-CoV-2; furthermore, treatment is not recommended for asymptomatic persons. Users of rapid Ag tests may not understand the limits of a negative test; in 1 study, two-thirds of participants believed that they were noninfectious the day following a negative rapid Ag test. Sensitivity is linked to timing of exposure; a negative result may convert to positive within hours early in infection. At 1% prevalence, the number of true-positive Ag test results was small and approximated the number of false-negative results, quantified as 6 true positives and 4 false negatives per 1000 asymptomatic individuals tested.

### Considerations for diagnostic COVID-19 tests [^115m6k96]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2021). High credibility.

During the early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, design, development, validation, verification and implementation of diagnostic tests were actively addressed by a large number of diagnostic test manufacturers. Hundreds of molecular tests and immunoassays were rapidly developed, albeit many still await clinical validation and formal approval. In this Review, we summarize the crucial role of diagnostic tests during the first global wave of COVID-19. We explore the technical and implementation problems encountered during this early phase in the pandemic, and try to define future directions for the progressive and better use of (syndromic) diagnostics during a possible resurgence of COVID-19 in future global waves or regional outbreaks. Continuous global improvement in diagnostic test preparedness is essential for more rapid detection of patients, possibly at the point of care, and for optimized prevention and treatment, in both industrialized countries and low-resource settings.

Infectious Diseases Society of America COVID-19 antigen testing — conclusions on diagnostic performance and use: Antigen (Ag) testing had a sensitivity of 80% in symptomatic individuals and 63% in asymptomatic persons, with pooled specificities of close to 100% in both populations, compared with a single standard nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). Despite the low sensitivity of Ag tests, standard NAAT remains the benchmark testing approach for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially when the pretest probability of infection is moderate to high or the harms of falsely negative results are significant. When standard NAAT is not available, timely, or feasible, Ag testing can be used without the need to routinely confirm positive test results. A negative Ag test does not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection; ideally, negative Ag test results should be confirmed by standard NAAT if the suspicion of COVID-19 is moderate or high, and repeat Ag testing may be considered when standard NAAT is not an option. A negative Ag test does not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness, although a positive Ag test makes infectiousness more likely.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^112mfMGv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular testing — Recommendation 5 states: The IDSA panel suggests performing a single NAAT and not repeating testing routinely in symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19 whose initial NAAT result is negative (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). The panel considered symptomatic patients to have at least one of the most common symptoms compatible with COVID-19 (Table 1). While the yield of repeat testing is low and therefore repeat testing is not suggested routinely, there may be situations where repeat testing might be considered, such as development of new or worsening symptoms in the absence of alternative explanations, timing of symptom onset that might drive a need for repeat testing, or a poorly collected specimen that could yield a falsely negative result. If performed, repeat testing should generally occur 24–48 hours after initial testing and once the initial NAAT result has returned as negative, and another specimen type, preferably a lower respiratory tract specimen if the patient has signs/symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection, should be considered for repeat testing.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen testing guidelines — overview of diagnostic role and evidence: Immunoassays detecting SARS-CoV-2 protein antigens are commonly used, with lateral flow assays generating results in approximately 15 minutes at the point of care. US Food and Drug Administration SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests with Emergency Use Authorization have high specificity and low to moderate sensitivity compared with nucleic acid amplification testing, and sensitivity depends on symptom status and, in symptomatic patients, on timing after symptom onset. In most cases, positive results can be acted upon without confirmation. Results of point-of-care testing are comparable to laboratory-based testing, and observed or unobserved self-collection yields similar results. Modeling suggests repeat antigen testing increases sensitivity compared with testing once, but no empirical data were available. Based on these observations, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT remain the testing methods of choice for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection; when timely molecular testing is not readily available or is logistically infeasible, antigen testing helps identify individuals with infection. The panel used GRADE, reviewed literature through 1 April 2022, and graded the overall quality of evidence as very low to moderate.

SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing — recommendation strength and clinical use relative to nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) — uses Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), where recommendations are categorized as "strong" or "conditional", with "recommend" indicating a strong recommendation and "suggest" indicating a conditional recommendation. Given the superior sensitivity of molecular diagnostics, the panel suggests using standard NAAT over Ag tests if standard NAAT is available and results of testing will be timely; however, rapid Ag testing has value when timely NAAT is unavailable, especially when results are positive, because the high specificity of Ag testing means that positive results are actionable without needing confirmation. In contrast, negative Ag results should be confirmed by standard NAAT when clinical suspicion of COVID-19 is high, and the panel notes treatment options are typically approved for administration within 5 days of symptom onset.

Molecular testing of nasopharyngeal specimens for SARS-CoV-2 are highly specific and sensitive. However, SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding within the respiratory specimens of individual patients may not be dependable or consistent throughout the course of illness. - The range of clinical presentations of COVID-19 present a diagnostic dilemma; reports of false positivesadd to uncertainty. Retesting of patients is increasingly requested in the setting of ongoing concern for COVID-19 after an initial negative test.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) molecular COVID-19 diagnostic testing guideline — Because EUA submissions require analytical but not clinical performance data, the panel identified few studies reporting clinical performance and based most recommendations on diagnostic test accuracy. Accuracy metrics include sensitivity and specificity, and positive and negative predictive values are essential; calculating predictive values requires prevalence or pre-test probability, yet true community prevalence may be ill-defined or underestimated when testing is limited or results are not reported. Accordingly, the panel varied estimates of prevalence/pre-test probability and assay sensitivity and specificity in analyses using available literature and public dashboards to mirror what may be encountered in clinical practice.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen testing in symptomatic individuals is addressed with the recommendation: test over no test. (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence) Symptomatic individuals were defined as those with at least 1 of the common symptoms of COVID-19. For optimal performance, Ag tests should be used within 5 days of symptom onset; the panel identified no studies that reported Ag test performance on the first or second day of symptoms. If clinical suspicion for COVID-19 remains high, a negative Ag result should be confirmed by standard NAAT (ie, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT). A single Ag test has high specificity; a positive result can be used to help guide treatment and isolation decisions without confirmation. There were limited data regarding the analytical performance of Ag tests in children, immunocompromised or vaccinated individuals, or in those who had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. The panel was unable to identify studies that compared the risk of transmission among patients recovering from COVID-19 who were released from isolation based on results of Ag testing versus no testing. We found no direct evidence that assessed patient- or population-centered outcomes of testing versus no testing in symptomatic patients. The reference standard in the included studies was standard NAAT (ie, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT). We identified 65 studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of Ag testing as compared with NAAT as a reference test in symptomatic individuals. The studies included 20 272 individuals for sensitivity.

COVID-19 symptomatic testing — additional considerations for NAAT versus repeat antigen testing: While repeat Ag testing is potentially a faster option, by definition it means that an initial test is negative but the person may still be infected. In symptomatic individuals, the recommended test is NAAT; however, access to NAAT testing may be limited (eg, on weekends and holidays) and is more costly than Ag testing, and therefore Ag testing may be preferred in some scenarios, and the time to results of standard NAAT may be delayed if there is not a rapid and reliable system in place to communicate results to healthcare providers and patients.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^113aCera]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — diagnostic accuracy within the first 2 weeks after symptom onset is based on 11 studies comparing serology with reverse transcription PCR, with included sample sizes for sensitivity analyses ranging from 1137 to 5161 and for specificity analyses from 4388 to 22,321; pooled specificity ranged from 98% to 99%. At 1 week after symptom onset, pooled sensitivity was 27% for IgM and 24% for IgG, and at 2 weeks it was 64% for IgM and 66% for IgG; although IgM responses often occur earlier for infections in general, with SARS-CoV-2 there does not appear to be a substantial difference in detection timing between IgM and IgG. If performed within 14 days of symptom onset, low sensitivity can yield many falsely negative results, and despite calculated specificity of 98%–99%, low-specificity assays can produce false-positive results for recent infection leading to incorrect conclusions and unnecessary actions. Serologic testing should not be performed routinely for diagnosis of acute COVID-19.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — regulatory and assay limitations note that although current EUA indications do not preclude use of antibody tests in vaccinated individuals, none of the currently authorized tests has been authorized to assess humoral immunity after vaccination or to define a threshold of protection after infection; therefore, the FDA recommends against SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing to assess immunity. Detection of anti-RBD-bAbs correlates with emergence of nAbs and nAbs have been associated with protection against COVID-19, yet a definitive correlate of protection has not been identified. Currently, only 1 commercial test has been authorized to detect nAbs from individuals with recent or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, but although calibrated against the WHO standard, it was not validated for testing after vaccination or for predicting protection from reinfection. Assays designed to quantify T-cell immune function are not widely available for clinical use.

### COVID-19 surveillance after expiration of the public health emergency declaration-United States, may 11, 2023 [^1173Z2Yi]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

On January 31, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared, under Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act, a U.S. public health emergency because of the emergence of a novel virus, SARS-CoV-2.* After 13 renewals, the public health emergency will expire on May 11, 2023. Authorizations to collect certain public health data will expire on that date as well. Monitoring the impact of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of prevention and control strategies remains a public health priority, and a number of surveillance indicators have been identified to facilitate ongoing monitoring. After expiration of the public health emergency, COVID-19-associated hospital admission levels will be the primary indicator of COVID-19 trends to help guide community and personal decisions related to risk and prevention behaviors; the percentage of COVID-19-associated deaths among all reported deaths, based on provisional death certificate data, will be the primary indicator used to monitor COVID-19 mortality. Emergency department (ED) visits with a COVID-19 diagnosis and the percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, derived from an established sentinel network, will help detect early changes in trends. National genomic surveillance will continue to be used to estimate SARS-CoV-2 variant proportions; wastewater surveillance and traveler-based genomic surveillance will also continue to be used to monitor SARS-CoV-2 variants. Disease severity and hospitalization-related outcomes are monitored via sentinel surveillance and large health care databases. Monitoring of COVID-19 vaccination coverage, vaccine effectiveness (VE), and vaccine safety will also continue. Integrated strategies for surveillance of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses can further guide prevention efforts. COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and deaths are largely preventable through receipt of updated vaccines and timely administration of therapeutics (1–4).

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: antigen testing (January 2023) [^116W1CxA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen testing in asymptomatic individuals — benefits, harms, and implementation considerations emphasize that antigen tests have reduced sensitivity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic individuals compared with standard NAAT, and Ag testing detects infection during a narrower window of time, while the specificity of Ag testing compared with standard NAAT is high, approaching 100% (Table 7). The potential harm of using an Ag test instead of a standard NAAT is the potential for false-negative results, which may be most harmful in high-risk settings such as healthcare settings and may also lead to transmission, especially if infection-prevention practices depend on test results. The panel highlights that there are currently no treatment options approved through FDA EUA for asymptomatic individuals, assumed that asymptomatic individuals are contagious at some point during infection, and found no direct evidence that testing for SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic individuals reduces risk of transmission. The panel concludes that standard NAATs will detect the larger number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide a greater number of opportunities to prevent transmission compared with currently available Ag tests, with the greatest impact when community prevalence is moderate to high (ie, ≥ 10%); however, less-sensitive rapid Ag tests may still be helpful in some lower prevalence settings when standard NAAT is not available, antigen testing is expected to detect infection when viral load is high, and routine confirmation of positive results is not necessary in most situations. Prior analysis on this question estimated additional 4 to 34 false-negative results with Ag testing when the prevalence ranged between 1% and 10%.

### What does COVID-19 testing results really say? The real statistics concealed behind the accessible data [^111gsrJN]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Accurate and comprehensive testing is crucial for practitioners to portray the pandemic. Without testing there is no data; yet, the exact number of infected people cannot be determined due to the lack of comprehensive testing. The number of seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 infection is obviously relative to the extent of testing. However, the true number of infections might be still far higher than the reported values. To compare the countries based on the number of seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 infection is misleading, as there may not be enough tests being carried out to properly monitor the outbreak. In this paper, we closely look through the COVID-19 testing results. Herein, we try to draw conclusions based on the reported data: first, the presence of a possible relationship between COVID-19 transition and patients' age will be assessed. Then, the COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR) is compared with the age-demographic data for different countries. Based on the results, a method for estimating a lower bound (minimum) for the number of actual positive cases will be developed and validated. Results of this study have shown that CFR is a metric reflecting the spread of the virus, but is a factor of the extent of testing and does not necessarily show the real size of the outbreak. Moreover, no large difference in susceptibility by age has been found. The results suggest the similarity between the age distribution of COVID-19 and the population age-demographic is improving over the course of the pandemic. In addition, countries with lower CFRs have a more similar COVID-19 age distribution, which is a result of more comprehensive testing. Finally, a method for estimation of the real number of infected people based on the age distributions, reported CFRs, and the extent of testing will be developed and validated.

Results

Of 2009 respondents to the question on COVID-19 self-testing, 1029 (51.2%) were female, and 244 (12.1%) were non-Hispanic Black; 361 (18.0%) were Hispanic; 185 (9.2%) were other, non-Hispanic or 2 or more races, non-Hispanic; and 1219 (60.7%) were non-Hispanic White, with mean (SD) age of 51.5 (18.4) years (Table 1). The survey completion rate was 63.4% (2016 of 3182).

Table 1.
Respondent Characteristics and Bivariate Associations With Intent to Test If COVID-19 Is Suspected a

Most respondents (70.0% [1407 of 2009]) would test if they suspected COVID-19. Several variables were associated with intent to test in bivariate analyses (Table 1). On multivariate analysis (Table 2), age older than 60 years; identifying as non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, or other or multiple races, non-Hispanic; reporting other than excellent health (good, fair, or poor); having higher trust in the health care system; strongly agreeing they depend on numbers to make decisions about health; and having previously completed a COVID-19 home test were all associated with being more likely to test.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen testing — diagnostic accuracy in symptomatic populations: Due to lack of direct evidence comparing Ag testing and standard NAAT with a threshold for determination, we relied on diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection using standard NAAT as the reference standard. To calculate standard NAAT diagnostic test accuracy, pooled results from 5 studies yielded sensitivity 97% (95% CI: 93% to 99%) and specificity 100% (95% CI: 96% to 100%). For comparative results, 70 studies — 65 informing Ag testing and the 5 informing standard NAAT — reported 26 021 positive and 51 593 negative results. The pooled sensitivity for Ag testing was 81% (95% CI: 78% to 84%) and the pooled specificity was 100% (95% CI: 100% to 100%). This resulted in an additional 8 to 80 false-negative Ag test results.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular testing — repeat NAAT after a negative result: Repeat SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing within 7 days of a negative test result rarely yields a positive result and the evidence supporting this conclusion is of very low quality. When repeat testing is considered, the site and quality of specimen collection should be carefully considered, and further studies are warranted regarding timing relative to symptom onset and the value of repeating testing on specimen types other than nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs.

Conclusion and future research

Future studies to evaluate serological tests for covid-19 should be designed to overcome the major limitations of the existing evidence base. This can be readily accomplished by adhering to the fundamentals of the design for diagnostic accuracy studies: a well defined use-case (ie, specific purpose for which the test is being used); consecutive sampling of the target population within the target use-case; performance of the index test in a standardised and blinded manner using the same methods that will be applied in the specialty; and ensuring the reference test is accurate, performed on all participants, and interpreted blind to the results of the index test. To reduce the likelihood of misclassification, the reference standard should consist of RT-PCR performed on at least two consecutive specimens, and, when feasible, include viral cultures. To reduce variability in estimates and enhance generalisability, sensitivity and specificity should be stratified by setting (outpatient versus in-patient), severity of illness, and the number of days elapsed since symptom onset.

In summary, we have found major weaknesses in the evidence base for serological tests for covid-19. The evidence does not support the continued use of existing point-of-care serological tests for covid-19. While the scientific community should be lauded for the pace at which novel serological tests have been developed, this review underscores the need for high quality clinical studies to evaluate these tools. With international collaboration, such studies could be rapidly conducted and provide less biased, more precise, and more generalisable information on which to base clinical and public health policy to alleviate the unprecedented global health emergency that is covid-19.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing guideline — abstract states that accurate molecular diagnostic tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are necessary to confirm coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and that direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in respiratory specimens informs decision-making at patient, healthcare institution, and public health levels. The guideline's goal was to develop an evidence-based diagnostic guideline to assist clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients and policymakers in decisions related to optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests, with IDSA convening a multidisciplinary panel and using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. The panel agreed on 12 diagnostic recommendations, and access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is described as critical for patient care and hospital infection prevention.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing — rapid nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) in patients (i.e., those with at least one common symptom of COVID-19) had predicted false negative results ranging from 2 to 20 and false positive results from 5 to 9 per 1000 patients tested across considered prevalences; the pooled sensitivity of the rapid tests was 96%, and all rapid molecular tests had very high specificities. Positive results from rapid NAATs do not usually need to be confirmed by standard laboratory-based NAATs, and negative rapid molecular test results do not need routine confirmation. The certainty of the evidence was moderate due to risk of bias with the use of laboratory-based NAAT as the reference standard, and with some inconsistency of sensitivity results for some assays.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing — pre-procedure screening of asymptomatic individuals is characterized by limited evidence and mixed benefits and harms. Across studies, 0–4% of healthcare providers who cared for the patients were reported to have positive SARS-CoV-2 test results sometime after the procedure, and the panel agreed that the overall certainty of the evidence supporting this recommendation was very low. The possible benefit of screening asymptomatic individuals include reducing exposure of healthcare providers and other patients to SARS-CoV-2, thereby reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, whereas potential harms include unnecessary delays in procedures and false confidence if a patient tested pre-procedure is in the incubation period and becomes infectious during the procedure. Institutions that require pre-procedure screening generally request testing within 72 hours of the scheduled procedure; a shorter window may better reflect risk but may be unrealistic for many institutions, particularly when testing is performed in an off-site laboratory. Wider use of point-of-care NAAT may be difficult due to testing logistics, supply chain concerns, and limited tests with an indication for use in asymptomatic individuals. In cases of positive results, deferring when other mitigation measures are in place, including vaccination of healthcare providers and use of appropriate PPE, may cause undue harm to the patient and have minimal or no effect on risk of transmission; this may be especially true for patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and are no longer infectious but who continue to shed non-viable SARS-CoV-2 detected by highly sensitive NAATs. The panel emphasized challenges of re-scheduling and increased risk from delaying procedures, and noted that linking a SARS-CoV-2 acquisition to an asymptomatic individual is difficult when community transmission levels are high.

Background — SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics context: In late December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia cases of unclear etiology was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, and based on genetic similarities, the novel coronavirus was officially named SARS-CoV-2; by March 11th, 2020, the virus had spread to at least 114 countries and killed more than 4,000 people, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a global pandemic. Public availability of the SARS-CoV-2 genome enabled development of accurate molecular diagnostic assays; on February 4, 2020, the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services announced that circumstances existed justifying authorization of the emergency use of SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests, and commercial manufacturers and clinical laboratories were required to submit details about their assays to the U.S. FDA for review and Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).

SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing — serial testing and evidence gaps — had no empirical data identified to inform the value of serial versus single sample testing compared with molecular testing, so mathematical modeling suggested that repeat testing would improve sensitivity; on 11 August 2022, the FDA issued recommendations for repeat Ag testing to diagnose COVID-19 in symptomatic and asymptomatic persons. A cited preprint reported improved sensitivity when asymptomatic study participants tested 3 times at 48-hour intervals and symptomatic study participants tested 2 times within 48 hours. Evidence gaps included performance in vaccinated, previously infected, immunocompromised, or recent variant-infected individuals; in a literature search through April 2022, the panel identified only 1 study that included persons tested after November 2021, and all studies compared Ag with molecular test results with none using a clinical reference standard.

SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing — performance versus nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) — shows very high specificity with variable sensitivity by symptoms and timing; the overall specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests was 99% or higher compared with standard NAAT, and routine confirmation of positive Ag results by a reference molecular method is not necessary in most settings. Pooled Ag test sensitivity was 81% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 78% to 84%) for symptomatic individuals and 89% (95% CI: 83% to 93%) if testing occurred within the first 5 days of illness; after 5 days of symptoms, sensitivity dropped to 54% (95% CI: 42% to 66%). Among asymptomatic individuals, the pooled sensitivity of Ag testing was 63%, and antigen tests performed similarly in adults and children although data on children were limited.

does not rule out an infection because some tests may not detect the virus early in an infection. Always do a repeat test 48 hours after a negative result on an antigen test. The FDA encourages you to voluntarily and anonymously report your positive or negative test results every time you use an at-home COVID-19 test. You can send your test result to MakeMyTestCount. org or use an app or other digital option for self-reporting that may be included with your test. Q: I got a negative test result on an at-home COVID-19 antigen test. Do I need to take another test. A: Yes. The FDA recommends repeat testing following a negative COVID-19 antigen test result whether or not you have COVID-19 symptoms. COVID-19 antigen tests are less accurate than molecular tests and may not detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus early in an infection or in people who do not have COVID-19 symptoms.

In August 2022, the FDA issued a Safety Communication on the need to perform repeat testing to reduce your risk of a false negative result. In November 2022, the FDA required all manufacturers of EUA-authorized COVID-19 antigen tests to update their labeling to reflect the need for repeat testing at least twice over three days for individuals with symptoms of COVID-19 and at least three times over five days for individuals without symptoms of COVID-19, as appropriate based on their authorized uses. Q: Can I use an authorized at-home COVID-19 diagnostic test if it was left outside in freezing temperatures or in the heat. A: Since shipping conditions may vary, test developers perform stability testing to ensure that the test performance will remain stable when tests are stored at various temperatures, including shipping during the summer in very hot regions and in the winter in very cold regions.

As long as the test line appear as described in the instructions, you can be confident that the test is performing as it should. If the line do not appear in the correct location and within the correct time as shown in the test instructions when you perform the test, then the results may not be accurate, and a new test is needed to get an accurate result. In addition, long exposure to high temperatures may impact the test performance. If your test has been left in a high temperature environment beyond the normal shipping time to be delivered to you, such as being left outside in the heat for several days, the FDA recommends considering using a different test.

COVID-19 testing plays a critical role in the fight against the virus. Understanding COVID-19 tests, including the different types of tests and their uses, and the types of samples the tests use, is key to making an informed decision that meets your needs. If you think you need a COVID-19 diagnostic test, you can find a community testing site in your state. You can also use an FDA-authorized at-home COVID-19 diagnostic test which gives you the option of self-testing where it is convenient for you. Be sure to check the At-Home OTC COVID-19 Diagnostic Tests website for information on expiration dates, who can use the test, and other details that may help you decide what test is right for you.

Be aware that COVID-19 diagnostic tests are authorized for specific uses and that laboratory-based molecular COVID-19 tests, are generally more accurate than at-home tests. To increase the accuracy of an at-home COVID-19 antigen diagnostic test, it is important to perform repeat testing, after 48 hours, following a negative test result, whether you have symptoms or not, to reduce your risk of a false negative test result.

### At-home COVID-19 diagnostic tests: frequently asked questions… [^117Szk1X]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

- Can I use an authorized at-home COVID-19 diagnostic test if it was left outside in freezing temperatures or in the heat.
- How is the expiration date determined for an at-home COVID-19 diagnostic test and can it be extended.
- Can I use an FDA-authorized at-home COVID-19 diagnostic test that is expired. If you receive a negative result on your at-home COVID-19 antigen test, it means the test did not detect the virus that causes COVID-19, but it. Q: How is the expiration date determined for an at-home COVID-19 diagnostic test and can it be extended. A: All at-home OTC COVID-19 diagnostic tests are labeled with an expiration date printed on the outer box or package. Generally, tests should not be used beyond this expiration date. However, as discussed here, these expiration dates can be extended beyond the date printed on the outer box or package as additional stability data is collected.

COVID-19 test manufacturers perform studies to show how long after manufacturing COVID-19 tests perform as accurately as the day the test was manufactured. The shelf-life is how long the test should perform as expected and is measured from the date the test was manufactured. The expiration date is set at the end of the shelf-life and is the date through which the test is expected to perform as accurately as when manufactured. You can check the Expiration Date column of the List of Authorized At-Home OTC COVID-19 Diagnostic Tests to see if the expiration date for your at-home OTC COVID-19 test has been extended and how to find any new expiration date. Q. Can I use an FDA-authorized at-home COVID-19 diagnostic test that is expired. A: The expiration date for an at-home COVID-19 diagnostic test may be extended beyond the date printed on the outer box or package as additional stability data is collected.

You can check the Expiration Date column of the List of Authorized At-Home OTC COVID-19 Diagnostic Tests to see if the expiration date for your at-home OTC COVID-19 test has been extended and how to find any new expiration date. The FDA does not recommend using at-home COVID-19 diagnostic tests beyond their authorized expiration dates, which, as noted above, may go beyond the date printed on the box. COVID-19 tests and the parts they are made of may degrade, or break down, over time. Because of this, expired test kits could give inaccurate or invalid test results.
