## Question

ST segment depression and T wave inversion etiology

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a synthesis of the etiologies of ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion, organized by mechanism and prioritized by urgency and prevalence, with explicit thresholds and differentials. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology linking ST-T changes to repolarization heterogeneity and injury currents. Then, I should verify the ischemic etiologies, including NSTE-ACS, occlusion MI patterns, and posterior MI. Next, I will review non-ischemic cardiac causes such as ventricular hypertrophy, conduction disease, and cardiomyopathies. After that, I need to check systemic and electrolyte contributors, neurogenic and drug effects, and physiologic or athletic variants. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic approach with thresholds, serial ECG strategy, and guideline-based disposition, while double-checking for pitfalls like cardiac memory and tachycardia-related repolarization changes [^112RBTSL] [^117GMN3p] [^1129kWtx].

> Let me first confirm the fundamental mechanism so I don't jump to conclusions: ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities reflect altered ventricular repolarization due to electrical heterogeneity across the myocardium, with "injury currents" during ischemia creating voltage gradients that manifest as ST depression or T-wave inversion on the surface ECG, and these patterns can be primary (repolarization altered directly) or secondary (due to altered depolarization sequences) [^111Dfn9e] [^112RBTSL].

> I will now examine ischemic etiologies, starting with NSTE-ACS, because this is the most time-sensitive and prognostically important cause of ST depression and T-wave inversion; ischemic ST depression is typically horizontal or downsloping ≥ 0.5 mm in two contiguous leads, and T-wave inversion > 1 mm in leads with prominent R waves supports ischemia, with diffuse ST depression plus ST elevation in aVR suggesting multivessel or left main disease and mandating urgent angiography and guideline-directed NSTE-ACS care [^1133hEK4] [^113XeWyS] [^1152bXwA] [^111UCT1j].

> Wait, let me verify occlusion MI patterns that lack classic STEMI criteria but still represent acute coronary occlusion; de Winter's sign with upsloping ST depression and hyperacute T waves in the precordial leads indicates proximal LAD occlusion and requires emergent angiography, and Wellens' pattern with biphasic or deep T-wave inversions in the anterior leads signals critical proximal LAD stenosis even when pain has resolved, necessitating urgent invasive evaluation [^113bHmaz] [^113XeWyS].

> Hold on, I should verify posterior MI recognition because isolated anterior ST depression can be misleading; posterior MI often shows ST depression in V1–V3 with dominant R waves and upright T waves, and posterior leads V7–V9 should be obtained when suspected to confirm ST elevation and guide reperfusion, as this pattern reflects circumflex or RCA occlusion and carries high risk if missed [^112rgH2v] [^111UCT1j].

> Next, I should review non-ischemic cardiac causes; ventricular hypertrophy produces secondary repolarization changes with ST depression and T-wave inversion that mirror the QRS axis, and bundle-branch block or pre-excitation can cause secondary ST-T abnormalities directed opposite to the altered depolarization vector, so I need to check for concomitant QRS widening or delta waves before attributing changes to ischemia [^114d8qqB] [^111ZfAGp] [^112RBTSL].

> Let me consider cardiomyopathies and myocarditis; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy frequently shows deep T-wave inversions and strain patterns, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy often has right precordial T-wave inversions with epsilon waves or ventricular ectopy, and Takotsubo syndrome evolves from diffuse ST elevation to deep, widespread T-wave inversions with QT prolongation that can persist beyond contractile recovery, so I should correlate with echo and, when needed, CMR to distinguish from ACS [^116Tw6m6] [^117EubJy] [^116d8aj8].

> I need to check arrhythmia-related repolarization changes; tachyarrhythmias and new-onset atrial fibrillation can cause ST depression and T-wave inversion via supply–demand mismatch and cardiac memory, so I should confirm the timing relative to arrhythmia onset and avoid prematurely labeling type 2 MI without corroborating ischemic evidence or imaging [^117GMN3p] [^1129kWtx].

> But wait, what if electrolytes are the driver; hypokalemia commonly causes T-wave flattening and ST depression, and even mild hypokalemia increases the prevalence of these ECG abnormalities, so I should confirm serum potassium and correct it while reassessing the ECG, recognizing that ECG changes alone are poor short-term prognostic markers in hypokalemia under usual care [^112EiS9g] [^1167cvXA].

> Let me think about neurogenic and systemic causes; intracranial hemorrhage and acute ischemic stroke can produce diffuse deep T-wave inversions and QT prolongation, and pulmonary embolism may show anterior T-wave inversions with right-sided strain, so I should integrate neurologic signs, respiratory status, and D-dimer or imaging when the clinical picture fits [^116Tw6m6] [^111qnvW1] [^111Ttrfv].

> I should double-check drug effects; digitalis can cause scooping ST depression and T-wave changes, and agents like fenoldopam, ondansetron, and others have been associated with ST-T abnormalities, so a careful medication reconciliation is essential before anchoring on ischemia [^1167cvXA] [^112RBTSL].

> Next, I should review physiologic and athletic variants; in trained athletes, anterior T-wave inversions in V1–V4 preceded by J-point elevation and convex ST elevation are often benign, especially in Black athletes, whereas T-wave inversion beyond V3, absence of J-point elevation, or depressed ST segments raise concern for cardiomyopathy, so I should use detraining or serial imaging when the diagnosis is uncertain [^1179JSPN] [^113pYyj5] [^1151jjGM].

> Hold on, I should verify thresholds and morphology so I don't misclassify; ischemic ST depression should be at least 0.5 mm horizontal or downsloping in two contiguous leads, and T-wave inversion > 1 mm in leads with R/S ratio > 1 supports ischemia, while minor nonspecific ST-T abnormalities can still carry long-term adverse prognostic implications in population studies, so I should document magnitude and lead distribution carefully [^1133hEK4] [^1172fcB9].

> I will now examine a practical diagnostic approach; in any patient with ischemic symptoms, obtain a 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes, repeat ECGs at 15–30 minute intervals if symptoms persist or the tracing is nondiagnostic, and add posterior leads V7–V9 when posterior MI is suspected, while correlating with serial high-sensitivity troponins and echocardiography to assess wall motion and complications, escalating to coronary angiography per NSTE-ACS or STEMI-equivalent pathways [^1112igCX] [^113XeWyS] [^111UCT1j].

> Let me reconsider prognostic distinctions so I don't over-interpret T-wave inversion; ST-segment depression on presentation independently predicts higher short- and long-term mortality in NSTE-ACS, whereas isolated T-wave inversion, while associated with higher-risk clinical features, does not consistently add independent prognostic value beyond established models, so I should weight ST depression more heavily in risk triage and treatment decisions [^112F4ohN] [^114QsKLL] [^115tZHzU].

> Finally, I should confirm disposition and follow-up; patients with ischemic ST depression or new T-wave inversions should be managed per NSTE-ACS pathways with antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy and early invasive evaluation, those with high-risk patterns such as diffuse ST depression with aVR elevation warrant emergent angiography, and patients with non-ischemic causes should have the underlying condition treated with targeted testing such as echocardiography, CMR, or neurologic imaging as indicated, ensuring serial ECGs to capture dynamic evolution that may clarify diagnosis and risk [^113XeWyS] [^1152bXwA] [^111UCT1j].

ST depression and T-wave inversion reflect **subendocardial ischemia** [^111Dfn9e] from coronary insufficiency, **ventricular strain** from pressure overload (LVH/RVH) [^114d8qqB], or **electrolyte/metabolic disturbances** (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, acidosis, hypothermia) [^115ysMoW] [^112EiS9g]. Other causes include **myocarditis/pericarditis** [^114weJcn], pulmonary embolism [^111Ttrfv], CNS injury [^116Tw6m6], and drugs (digoxin, antiarrhythmics, CCBs) [^1167cvXA]. In athletes, benign repolarization variants are common [^1179JSPN]; however, persistent or deep inversions, especially with symptoms, warrant evaluation for cardiomyopathy or ischemia [^1151jjGM]. Accurate diagnosis relies on **clinical context**, serial ECGs, and targeted testing [^113XeWyS].

## Ischemic etiologies

### Acute coronary syndromes (ACS)

- **Non-ST-elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS)**: ST depression and T-wave inversion are classic for subendocardial ischemia [^notfound] and correlate with adverse outcomes [^115tZHzU] [^117M7Him].

- **Posterior MI**: ST depression in V1–V3 with dominant R waves reflects posterior ischemia; posterior leads V7–V9 confirm diagnosis [^112rgH2v] [^111UCT1j].

- **De Winter pattern**: Upsloping ST depression with peaked T waves in precordial leads indicates proximal LAD occlusion and mandates urgent angiography [^113bHmaz].

---

## Non-ischemic cardiac etiologies

### Ventricular hypertrophy and strain

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) produces **strain-pattern ST depression and T-wave inversion** in lateral leads [^114d8qqB], whereas right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) causes **right precordial ST depression and T-wave inversion** with right-axis deviation [^114d8qqB].

---

### Conduction abnormalities

Bundle branch block causes **secondary repolarization changes** with ST depression and T-wave inversion opposite to the QRS axis [^111ZfAGp], and ventricular pre-excitation (**WPW**) produces **secondary repolarization changes** with ST depression and T-wave inversion opposite to the delta wave [^111ZfAGp].

---

### Myocarditis and pericarditis

Myocarditis may show **diffuse ST depression and T-wave inversion** from inflammation and myocardial injury, whereas pericarditis typically presents with **diffuse concave ST elevation**; however, T-wave inversion can occur later [^114weJcn] [^1166FN3t].

---

## Electrolyte and metabolic disturbances

- **Hypokalemia**: Flattened T waves, ST depression, and U waves are characteristic [^112EiS9g] [^115ysMoW].

- **Hypomagnesemia**: Exacerbates hypokalemia-related repolarization changes [^notfound].

- **Acid-base disorders**: Metabolic acidosis and hypothermia alter repolarization and cause ST depression and T-wave inversion [^112RBTSL].

---

## Pulmonary and neurological conditions

Pulmonary embolism causes **right-sided strain** with right precordial ST depression and T-wave inversion [^111Ttrfv], whereas **intracranial hemorrhage** produces **deep, symmetric T-wave inversions** from catecholamine surge and myocardial stunning [^116Tw6m6].

---

## Drug-induced repolarization changes

- **Digitalis**: Scooped ST depression and T-wave flattening are classic [^notfound].

- **Antiarrhythmics**: Amiodarone, quinidine, and others can cause ST depression and T-wave inversion [^notfound].

- **Calcium channel blockers**: Nicardipine and others may cause ST depression and T-wave inversion [^1167cvXA] [^111qnvW1].

---

## Physiological and benign variants

Athlete's heart often shows **benign anterior T-wave inversion** with J-point elevation and early repolarization, especially in Black athletes [^1179JSPN] [^1151jjGM]. Early repolarization presents with **J-point elevation** and benign ST depression/T-wave inversion, particularly in young, healthy individuals [^116GuRqT].

---

## Clinical approach to diagnosis

- **Clinical context**: Assess symptoms, risk factors, and history to prioritize ischemic vs non-ischemic causes [^113e7qBD].

- **Serial ECGs**: Dynamic changes favor ischemia; static changes suggest structural or metabolic causes [^1112igCX].

- **Echocardiography**: Evaluate for wall motion abnormalities, hypertrophy, or pericardial effusion [^114UiAQU].

- **Laboratory tests**: Troponins, electrolytes, and acid-base status guide diagnosis [^113e7qBD].

- **Coronary angiography**: Indicated for suspected ACS or high-risk ECG patterns (e.g. De Winter, posterior MI) [^113e7qBD] [^113bHmaz].

---

ST depression and T-wave inversion arise from diverse causes, including ischemia, ventricular strain, electrolyte disturbances, myocarditis, pulmonary embolism, CNS injury, drugs, and benign variants. Accurate diagnosis requires **clinical context**, serial ECGs, and targeted testing to guide management.

### The evolution of electrocardiographic changes in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^113FeZKa]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a not uncommon diagnosis in the emergency department. During ST-segment elevation AMI (STEMI), the electrocardiogram (ECG) typically follows a progression of abnormality, beginning with hyperacute T waves and culminating with ST-segment elevation; pathologic Q waves can appear early and/or late in the process. Other findings include T-wave inversion and ST-segment depression which can occur before, during, or after the STEMI event. The evolution of ECG through these changes can occur rapidly after coronary artery occlusion. The emergency physician should be aware of the ECG findings that characterize the evolution of an STEMI with a sound understanding of the associated pathophysiology and clinical implication. This review discusses the changing ECG during an AMI. The pathogenesis of these findings is discussed. Finally, the clinical implications at each stage are reviewed.

AHA/ACCF/HRS ST-segment depression and etiologies of ST-segment elevation: ST-segment elevation can most often be attributed to 3 specific causes — early repolarization, injury currents associated with acute ischemia or ventricular dyskinesis, and injury currents usually associated with pericarditis — and criteria exist to differentiate these causes and should be incorporated into the descriptive diagnostic algorithms of the various computer-ECG algorithms; ST depression may be caused by various physiological, pathological, and pharmacological interventions including ischemia, hypokalemia, and a variety of cardiac and noncardiac drugs and may occur concurrently with T-wave changes such as those associated with hypertrophy and ventricular conduction disturbances; for thresholds, part VI gives −0.05 as the recommended threshold value for abnormal J-point depression in leads V2 and V3 in men and women and −0.1 mV in all other leads.

T-wave abnormalities — giant inversion causes and notching versus U wave are described: giant T-wave inversion is usually limited to entities including hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, non–ST-segment elevated myocardial infarctions, and neurological events, particularly intracranial hemorrhage; for minor T-wave abnormalities, classification as slight or indeterminate T-wave abnormality is appropriate; the T wave is rarely notched in all 12 leads and the interval between the 2 summits of a notched T wave is usually less than the interval between the peak of a monophasic T wave and the U wave, which usually exceeds 150 ms at heart rates of 50 to 100 bpm.

Among other possible causes, ST-segment depression can be caused by supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, right bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular hypertrophy, hypokalemia, unstable angina, pulmonary embolism, Prinzmetal's angina and myocardial infarction. In addition, ST-segment depression can be caused by medications such as digoxin, pregabalin, conivaptan, ondansetron hydrochloride, lincomycin, fenoldopam, ondansetron, regadenoson and nicardipine.

### Comparative prognostic value of T-wave inversion and ST-segment depression on the admission electrocardiogram in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes [^112F4ohN]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

ST-segment depression (STD) is predictive of adverse outcomes in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS), but there are conflicting data on the incremental prognostic value of T-wave inversions (TWIs) on the admission electrocardiogram.

Methods

Admission electrocardiograms of 7,343 patients with NSTE-ACS from the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) and ACS I registry were independently analyzed at a core laboratory and stratified by TWI and STD status. We performed multivariable analyses to determine the independent prognostic significance of TWI and tested for interaction between TWI and STD for adverse outcomes.

Results

Patients with TWI and/or STD had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, higher Killip class, and higher GRACE risk scores. Among the 2,708 patients with available angiographic data, rates of 3-vessel or left main disease were similar between patients with TWI and those without TWI/STD. After adjusting for other established prognosticators, TWI did not independently predict in-hospital (adjusted odds ratio 1.03, 95% CI 0.75–1.42, P = 0.85) or 6-month mortality (adjusted odds ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.80–1.30, P = 0.88); STD remained a strong independent predictor. There was no interaction between TWI and STD for these outcomes. No contiguous lead groups or cumulative number of leads with TWI provided independent prognostic information.

Conclusions

TWI is associated with other high-risk clinical features but is not an independent predictor of adverse short- and long-term mortality in NSTE-ACS. T-wave inversion does not provide additional prognostication beyond the GRACE risk model, and its concomitant presence does not alter the prognostic value of STD.

### Twenty-eight genetic loci associated with ST-T-wave amplitudes of the electrocardiogram [^115EQAaU]. Human Molecular Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Duration of cardiac repolarization has been previously studied by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and led to the discovery of 35 associated loci. However, abnormalities of repolarization are not limited to changes in duration, but are also captured by changes in amplitudes. Ventricular repolarization occurs in a geometric pattern across the heart. This process entails differences in timings of recovery across the ventricular wall and between regions of the left ventricle after ventricular depolarization. The cellular basis for the origins of the ST-segment and adjacent T wave (ST-T wave) amplitudes is still under debate, but is generally thought to arise as a consequence of electrical heterogeneities that exist within the ventricular myocardium. It is thought that the ST-T wave begins when the epicardial cells start to recover ahead of the midwall and endocardial cells. Electrical currents flow from the midmyocardial and endocardial regions toward the epicardium, resulting in a gradual rise in current, until the epicardium is fully repolarized and the currents have reached maximal intensity (T-top). Continuous indices of T-wave amplitudes are not only relevant in patients with myocardial infarction, ischemic cardiomyopathy and a malignant form of ER, but also in non-diseased population cohorts. In the general or healthy population, inversions of the ST-T wave are strongly associated with adverse outcome, but also minor depressions or elevations in ST-T-wave amplitudes are predictors of cardiovascular mortality and disease.

Deviations of ST-T-wave amplitudes can be indicative of a variety of cardiac pathologies, including myocardial ischemia, ventricular hypertrophy, long-QT syndrome, ER and Brugada syndrome (,–). For clinical use, phenotypes are dichotomized based on optimal sensitivity and specificity to predict worse outcome. However, there is no evidence that the underlying biology of ST-T wave is truly binary. Therefore, we hypothesized that common genetic variation involved in the biology of quantitative ST-T waves traits might provide additional biological insights into the (patho)physiological mechanisms of repolarization. GWAS have proven to be a powerful and unbiased tool to identify novel mechanisms and pathways.

Here, we aim to identify key genetic loci associated with the heart's repolarization phase during the ST-T wave of the electrocardiogram (ECG) to further advance our knowledge on biological factors regulating cardiac repolarization and thereby provide new gene targets for future study.

### International expert consensus document on Takotsubo syndrome (part II): diagnostic workup, outcome, and management [^115fwNV2]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

T-wave inversion and QT interval prolongation

Progressive T-wave inversion and QT interval prolongation is a common ECG finding in TTS. In patients with delayed presentation, these changes may be present on admission in the absence of ST-segment elevation, and can be the only detectable ECG changes and therefore important for the diagnosis. The geographic distribution of T-wave inversion closely parallels that of ST-segment elevation and may be an electrophysiological manifestation of myocardial stunning. In TTS, T-wave inversion is often more prominent and more broadly distributed than in ACS. Furthermore, T-wave inversion is associated with presence of myocardial oedema, and may persist for several months even after LV contractile recovery, thus leaving an electrophysiological footprint of the TTS event. QT interval prolongation provides a substrate for torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia and may be a prognostic marker for sudden cardiac death,

Other electrocardiogram findings

Anterior Q-waves (or poor R-wave progression) without accompanying ST-segment elevation or T-wave inversion, a pattern sometimes referred to as 'anterior infarction, age indeterminate' occurs with some frequency in TTS. Pathologic Q-waves are less frequently encountered in TTS than anterior STEMI (15% vs. 69%). In TTS, as in anterior STEMI, Q-waves may occur in the acute phase, and regress rapidly with R-wave re-appearance, consistent with electrical stunning. Both J-wave and/or fragmented QRS complexes have been reported acutely, the former associated with death from cardiac causes and/or ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Low QRS voltage likely representing myocardial oedema is prevalent in TTS. Left bundle branch block is present in around 5% of patients.ST-segment depression is uncommon, occurring in fewer than 10% of TTS patients but in over 30% of ACS patients, therefore, the presence of ST-segment depression may suggest ACS.

### Lead aVL on electrocardiogram: emerging as important lead in early diagnosis of myocardial infarction? [^1125FPR9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Although a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) that mandates emergency reperfusion therapy requires ST-segment elevation greater than 1 mm in at least 2 contiguous leads, some of the early electrocardiogram (ECG) changes of AMI can be subtle. Any ST-segment depression or T-wave inversion in lead aVL may be implicated in left anterior descending artery lesion or early reciprocal changes of inferior wall myocardial infarction, particularly when the clinical context suggests ischemia. Early recognition of reciprocal changes and serial ECG help initiate early appropriate intervention. Heightened awareness of ST segment and T-wave changes in lead aVL is of paramount importance to quickly identifying life-threatening condition.

### Diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome [^115RRtwR]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

The term "acute coronary syndrome" encompasses a range of thrombotic coronary artery diseases, including unstable angina and both ST-segment elevation and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Diagnosis requires an electrocardiogram and a careful review for signs and symptoms of cardiac ischemia. In acute coronary syndrome, common electrocardiographic abnormalities include T-wave tenting or inversion, ST-segment elevation or depression (including J-point elevation in multiple leads), and pathologic Q waves. Risk stratification allows appropriate referral of patients to a chest pain center or emergency department, where cardiac enzyme levels can be assessed. Most high-risk patients should be hospitalized. Intermediate-risk patients should undergo a structured evaluation, often in a chest pain unit. Many low-risk patients can be discharged with appropriate follow-up. Troponin T or I generally is the most sensitive determinant of acute coronary syndrome, although the MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase also is used. Early markers of acute ischemia include myoglobin and creatine kinase-MB subforms (or isoforms), when available. In the future, advanced diagnostic modalities, such as myocardial perfusion imaging, may have a role in reducing unnecessary hospitalizations.

### Predictive value of T-wave abnormalities at the time of emergency department presentation in patients with potential acute coronary syndromes [^117M7Him]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

T-wave abnormalities on electrocardiograms (ECGs) are common, but their ability to predict 30-day cardiovascular outcomes at the time of emergency department (ED) presentation is unknown. The authors determined the association between T-wave abnormalities on the presenting ECG and cardiovascular outcomes within 30 days of presentation in patients with potential acute coronary syndromes (ACSs).

Methods

This was a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of ED patients that presented with a potential ACS. Patients were excluded if they had a prior myocardial infarction, ST-segment elevation or depressions, right or left bundle branch block, or Q-waves on the initial ECG. Data included demographics, medical and cardiac history, and ECG findings including the presence or absence of T-wave flattening, inversions of 1–5 mm, and inversions > 5 mm. Investigators followed the hospital course for admitted patients, and 30-day follow-up was performed on all patients. The main outcome was a composite of death, acute myocardial infarction, revascularization, coronary stenosis greater than 50%, or a stress test with reversible ischemia.

Results

Of 8,298 patient visits, 5,582 met criteria for inclusion: 4,166 (74.6%) had no T-wave abnormalities, 721 (12.9%) had T-wave flattening in two or more leads, 659 (11.8%) had T-wave inversions of 1–5 mm, and 36 (0.64%) had T-wave inversions > 5 mm. The composite endpoint was more common in patients with T-wave flattening (8.2% vs. 5.7%; p = 0.0001; relative risk [RR] = 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1 to 1.9), T-wave inversions 1–5 mm (13.2% vs. 5.7%; p = 0.0001; RR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.8 to 3.1), and T-wave inversions > 5 mm (19.4% vs. 5.7%; p = 0.0001; RR = 3.4; 95% CI = 1.7 to 6.1), or any T-wave abnormality (10.8% vs. 5.7%; p = 0.0001; RR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.6 to 2.3), even after adjustment for initial troponin. This association also existed in the subset of patients without known coronary artery disease.

Conclusions

In patients with potential ACS presenting to the ED, T-wave abnormalities are associated with higher rates of 30-day cardiovascular events.

### Influence of presenting electrocardiographic findings on the treatment and outcomes of patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^114QsKLL]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The influence of the presenting electrocardiographic (ECG) findings on the treatment and outcomes of patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) has not been studied in contemporary practice. We analyzed the clinical characteristics, in-hospital management, and in-hospital outcomes of patients with NSTEMI in the Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get With The Guidelines (ACTION Registry-GWTG) according to the presenting ECG findings. A total of 175,556 patients from 485 sites from January 2007 to September 2011 were stratified by the ECG findings on presentation: ST depression (n = 40,146, 22.9%), T-wave inversions (n = 24,627, 14%), transient ST-segment elevation (n = 5,050, 2.9%), and no ischemic changes (n = 105,733, 60.2%). Patients presenting with ST-segment depression were the oldest and had the greatest prevalence of major cardiac risk factors. Coronary angiography was performed most frequently in the transient ST-segment elevation group, followed by the T-wave inversion, ST-segment depression, and no ischemic changes groups. The angiogram revealed that patients with ST-segment depression had more left main, proximal left anterior descending, and 3-vessel coronary artery disease and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting most often. In contrast, patients with transient ST-segment elevation had 1-vessel CAD and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention the most. The unadjusted mortality was highest in the ST-segment depression group, followed by the no ischemic changes, transient ST-segment elevation, and T-wave inversion group. Adjusted mortality using the ACTION Registry-GWTG in-hospital mortality model with the no ischemic changes group as the reference showed that in-hospital mortality was similar in the transient ST-segment elevation (odds ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 0.97 to 1.37; p = 0.10), higher in the ST-segment depression group (odds ratio 1.46, 95% confidence interval 1.37 to 1.54; p < 0.0001), and lower in the T-wave inversion group (odds ratio 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 0.99; p = 0.026). In conclusion, the clinical and angiographic characteristics and treatment and outcomes of patients with NSTEMI differed substantially according to the presenting ECG findings. Patients with ST-segment depression have a greater burden of co-morbidities and coronary atherosclerosis and have a greater risk of adjusted in-hospital mortality compared with the other groups. These findings highlight the importance of integrating the presenting ECG findings into the risk stratification algorithm for patients with NSTEMI.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the evaluation and disposition of acute chest pain in the Emergency department: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^113XeWyS]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) assessment — algorithmic disposition — routes patients by ECG category: STEMI or STEMI equivalent — manage as per 2013 ACCF/AHA STEMI guideline; ischemic ST-segment depression or T-wave inversion, ST-segment elevation in aVR with multilead ST-depression, or Wellen's Sign — manage as per 2014 AHA/ACC NSTE-ACS guideline; other findings concerning for acute ischemia or infarction — emergent cardiology consultation, perform serial ECGs over short intervals, and emergent echocardiogram; nonischemic ECG — patients are appropriate for evaluating using a clinical decision pathway (CDP).

### AHA / ACCF / HRS recommendations for the standardization and interpretation of the electrocardiogram: part VI: acute ischemia / infarction: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association electrocardiography and arrhythmias committee, council on clinical cardiology; the American college of cardiology foundation; and the Heart Rhythm Society. endorsed by the international society for computerized electrocardiology [^111Dfn9e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

AHA/ACCF/HRS electrocardiogram interpretation — acute ischemia/infarction — identifies the electrocardiogram (ECG) as the single most important initial clinical test for diagnosing myocardial ischemia and infarction, and notes that correct interpretation, particularly in the emergency department, is usually the basis for immediate therapeutic interventions and/or subsequent diagnostic tests. ECG changes that occur with acute ischemia and infarction include peaking of the T waves (hyperacute T‑wave changes), ST‑segment elevation and/or depression, changes in the QRS complex, and inverted T waves. ST‑segment changes are attributed to the flow of currents, referred to as "injury currents", generated by voltage gradients between ischemic and nonischemic myocardium during the resting and plateau phases of the ventricular action potential, which correspond to the TQ and ST segments of the ECG.

### Takotsubo syndrome: pathophysiology, emerging concepts, and clinical implications [^117EubJy]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Electrocardiogram

The electrocardiogram commonly demonstrates acute dynamic changes at presentation, resembling those of an acute coronary syndrome. The commonest abnormalities are ST elevation, T wave inversion, and left bundle branch block. ST elevation and T wave inversion are widespread and may not localize to a particular territory. Three evolving electrocardiographic stages of takotsubo syndrome have been described. Stage 1 involves ST deviation occurring within the first few hours of symptoms onset. Stage 2 involves progressive deep T wave inversion and QTc prolongation, occurring within 1–3 days and peaking at 2–6 days, although when corrected for gender, the QTc is not different from male patients with acute myocardial infarction. These T wave inversions are usually widespread over the precordial (V1–6), bipolar (I, II) and lateral limb (aVL) leads and to correlate with myocardial edema, which can persist beyond ventricular contractile recovery. During these first 24–48 hours, torsade de pointes and other ventricular tachycardias can occur. The association of ventricular arrhythmias with prolonged QTc segment in takotsubo syndrome is well established. However, ventricular arrhythmias in the hyperacute phase of takotsubo syndrome are unlikely to be related to QTc prolongation. It is also possible that patients present with ventricular arrhythmia and are only subsequently diagnosed with takotsubo syndrome, making it very difficult to understand which occurred first. Stage 3 involves gradual resolution of T wave and QTc changes over subsequent weeks or months. The normalization of myocardial contractile function occurring prior to long-lasting electrocardiographic abnormalities is in stark contrast with the simultaneous recovery of both contractile function and the electrocardiogram seen after restoration of blood flow in ischemic myocardial stunning. Together with a relative absence of isolated ST-depression on presentation electrocardiogram, these concepts would argue against classical myocardial ischemia playing a part in the etiology of takotsubo syndrome.

Other electrocardiographic findings have also been reported. A J wave and fragmented QRS during the hyper-acute period has been describedas well as low voltage QRS complexes. In those presenting with ST segment elevation, the elevation is more subtle or of lower voltage compared to patients with acute myocardial infarction.Q waves may also occur acutely and disappear rapidly with re-appearance of the R wave. In conclusion, subtle differences in electrocardiographic changes exist between takotsubo syndrome and acute coronary syndrome. The presence of ST-segment elevation will impact whether the patient undergoes coronary angiography as an emergency or the procedure is slightly deferred.

### Acute coronary syndrome: diagnosis and initial management [^113e7qBD]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is defined as reduced blood flow to the coronary myocardium manifesting as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction or non-ST-segment elevation ACS, which includes unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Common risk factors include being at least 65 years of age or a current smoker or having hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, a body mass index greater than 25 kg per m², or a family history of premature coronary artery disease. Symptoms most predictive of ACS include chest discomfort that is substernal or spreading to the arms or jaw. However, chest pain that can be reproduced with palpation or varies with breathing or position is less likely to signify ACS. Having a prior abnormal cardiac stress test result indicates increased risk. Electrocardiography changes that predict ACS include ST depression, ST elevation, T-wave inversion, or presence of Q waves. No validated clinical decision tool is available to rule out ACS in the outpatient setting. Elevated troponin levels without ST-segment elevation on electrocardiography suggest non-ST-segment elevation ACS. Patients with ACS should receive coronary angiography with percutaneous or surgical revascularization. Other important management considerations include initiation of dual antiplatelet therapy and parenteral anticoagulation, statin therapy, beta-blocker therapy, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor therapy. Additional interventions shown to reduce mortality in patients who have had a recent myocardial infarction include smoking cessation, annual influenza vaccination, and cardiac rehabilitation.

### A new ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction equivalent pattern? Prominent T wave and J-point depression in the precordial leads associated with ST-segment elevation in lead aVr [^1115JqhS]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Certain acute coronary syndrome electrocardiographic (ECG) patterns, which do not include ST-segment elevation, are indicative of acute coronary syndrome caused by significant arterial occlusion; these patterns are, of course, associated with significant risk to the patient and mandate a rapid response from the health care team. One such high-risk ECG pattern includes the association of the prominent T wave and J-point depression producing ST-segment depression seen in the precordial leads coupled with ST-segment elevation in lead aVr. This ECG presentation is associated with significant left anterior descending artery obstruction. We report the case of a patient with this ECG presentation who progressed over a very short time to ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction of the anterior wall.

Zaidi et al investigated the accuracy of these ECG criteria for diagnosis of AC when applied to athletes 15 and demonstrated that isolated anterior TWI do not discriminate between patient with AC and healthy athletes. ECG features associated with physiological remodeling were the presence of J‐point elevation, early repolarization, biphasic TWIs, and voltage criteria for left and/or right ventricular hypertrophy. 15 On the other side, ECG markers more commonly associated with AC included TWI preceded by an isoelectric or a depressed ST‐segment and the presence of low QRS voltages. Markers in favor of the diagnosis of AC included also symptoms, like syncope, presence of Q waves or precordial QRS voltages < 1.8 mV, three abnormal SAECG parameters, delayed gadolinium enhancement identified by CMR, RV ejection fraction ≤ 45%, or wall motion abnormalities, and presence of premature ventricular beats. 15, 16, 17, 18

EXAMPLES OF T-WAVE INVERSION IN ATHLETES WITHOUT PROVEN CARDIOMYOPATHY

Cardiac pathologies associated with T-wave inversion

HCM (figure 3) is characterised by the presence of increased ventricular wall thickness or mass in the absence of loading conditions (hypertension, valve disease, etc) sufficient to cause the observed abnormality. There are three important spectral ECG changes commonly observed within HCM; the ECG is abnormal in approximately 90% of patients with HCM, whereas voltage criteria for LVH are present in around 75% of patients with HCM, isolated Sokolow-Lyon voltage criterion for LVH commonly observed within athletes (without associated ST and T wave changes) occurs in only 2% of HCM patients, and repolarisation changes consisting of ST segment shift and T-wave inversion are present in over 90% of cases. ARVC (figure 4) is a myocardial disease characterised by fibro-fatty replacement and ventricular arrhythmias. The fibro-fatty replacement interferes with electrical impulse conduction and is the key cause of T-wave inversion in the right precordial leads, ɛ waves, RBBB, late potentials and re-entrant ventricular arrhythmias. Brugada syndrome (figure 5) is characterised by a QRS complex resembling incomplete RBBB with J point elevation and ST-segment elevation in V1 through V3, often followed by a negative T-wave and a propensity for SCD typically occurring with mild activity or during sleep. It remains a diagnostic challenge to exclude Brugada syndrome in young athletes as features such as mild elevation of the J point associated with mild ST segment elevation in the anterior chest leads and mild T-wave inversion (< 0.2 mV) in V1–2 and the inferior leads, together with incomplete RBBB are frequently observed.

FIGURE 3
Anterior T‐wave inversion (TWI) in a 28‐year‐old male black athlete practicing basketball. On the left, the ECG showed negative T waves from V1 to V4 preceded by J‐point elevation and convex ST‐segment elevation; the electrocardiogram was collected at peak training. On the right, the electrocardiogram of the same athlete recorded after the period of low training regimen: a complete positivization of anterior TWI is observed after detraining in this subject, supporting the physiological interpretation of these data. ECG, electrocardiogram

A comparison between anterior TWI in groups of black and white healthy athletes, with patients with HCM and AC, demonstrated that both in white and black athletes the presence of TWI in leads V1 to V4 preceded by J‐point elevation ≥ 1 mm excluded a cardiomyopathy (100% negative predictive value). 10 A recent study by McClean et al investigated the prevalence and distribution of TWI in an adolescent and young population of Arab and black athletes (aged 11‐18 years) and reported that 15.8% presented anterior TWI, in the majority of cases confined to leads V1 to V3. 33 In this study, the prevalence of anterior TWI and of Jt elevation was higher in Arabic athletes aged < 16 years and in black athletes. Of notice, in three black athletes, a cardiac disease was diagnosed; in these cases, TWI in leads V1 to V4 was associated with other abnormal features, such as lateral TWI, Q waves, or wide QRS. Therefore, the interpretation of ECG in black athletes may be challenging, but the knowledge of physiological ECG variants in this ethnicity may useful to reduce the burden of false‐positive ECGs and to distinguish between physiological and pathological remodeling.

In summary, anterior TWI in black athletes should be considered a common ECG finding in presence of a J‐point elevation and convex ST‐segment elevation followed by TWI in V2‐V4, as recommended. 7 Conversely, when anterior TWI is associated with other ECG anomalies or when the characteristics of anterior TWI does not suggest a benign pattern of repolarization (eg, TWI preceded by ST‐segment depression of deep TWI), further investigations are recommended.

### Impact of minor electrocardiographic ST-segment and / or T-wave abnormalities on cardiovascular mortality during long-term follow-up [^1172fcB9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Minor ST-T abnormalities are common on the resting electrocardiogram of otherwise healthy persons, but the long-term importance of these findings has not been extensively evaluated, especially in women. In a prospective study, 7,985 women and 9,630 men (aged 40 to 64 years at baseline) without other electrocardiographic abnormalities and free of previous coronary heart disease (CHD) were studied using Cox regression for 22-years of follow-up. Primary outcomes were death from CHD and total cardiovascular disease (CVD); total mortality was a secondary outcome. Minnesota Code was employed to assess the presence or absence of electrocardiographic abnormalities. Analyses compared persons with minor Minnesota Code ST-segment (codes 4–3 or 4–4) or T-wave findings (codes 5–3 or 5–4) to those with normal electrocardiographic findings. In combined analyses of men and women adjusted for age, isolated minor T-wave abnormality, minor ST-segment depression, or a combination of minor ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities were each associated with increased mortality risks. For CHD mortality, hazard ratios (HRs) ranged from 1.60 to 2.10; for CVD mortality, HRs ranged from 1.50 to 1.95; and for total mortality, HRs ranged from 1.31 to 1.50 (p < 0.05 for all HRs). In separate analyses by gender adjusted for age, increased risks were observed for combined ST-T-wave abnormalities in both genders for CHD and CVD mortality (HR 1.72 to 1.75 for men, p < 0.05; HR 2.07 to 2.51 for women, p < 0.001). These data indicate that nonspecific (minor) ST-segment depression and/or T-wave abnormalities have a long-term prognostic impact for CHD and CVD death in middle-aged women and men and can be considered markers of heightened CHD and CVD risk.

### Electrocardiographic precordial ST-segment deviations and the risk of cardiovascular death: results from the copenhagen ECG study [^116GuRqT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

ST‐segment deviations in the standard surface electrocardiogram (ECG) are a common finding. The electrocardiographic ST‐segment reflects the depolarized state and initial repolarization of the ventricles and several factors are known to affect the ST‐segment including acute ischemic disease, ventricular hypertrophy, electrolytes, various medications, gender, and age.

ST‐depression in the lateral precordial leads (V5 to V6) has previously been associated with increased mortality in a wide variety of populations. – Such ST‐depressions often appear as a strain pattern with inverted T‐waves thought to result from subendocardial ischemia or as a consequence of an increased ventricular workload.

The case of ST‐elevation in the precordial leads is more complex in its origin and implications. Right and antero‐septal precordial ST‐elevations has been described as a normal variant in young males – but is also associated with potentially arrythmogenic conditions such as Brugada and early repolarization syndromes.

We sought to investigate the spectrum and prevalence of precordial ST‐segment deviations and their relation to age and gender in a large contemporary primary care population. Additionally, we aimed to investigate the association between various degrees of precordial ST‐deviations and the risk of cardiovascular death (CVD). We believe that such knowledge could lead to a better pathophysiological understanding of the nature of ST‐deviations and potentially improve risk stratification of patients undergoing standard cardiovascular evaluation.

New horizontal or downsloping ST-depression ≥ 0.5 mm in 2 contiguous leads and/or T inversion > 1 mm in 2 contiguous leads with prominent R wave or R/S ratio > 1 are also listed. QRS onset is recommended as the reference point for J-point determination.

Electrocardiogram

The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) is abnormal in most patients with TTS usually demonstrating ischaemic ST-segment elevation, T-wave inversion, or both. In the InterTAK Registry, ST-segment elevation was present in 44%, ST-segment depression in 8%, T-wave inversion in 41%, and left bundle branch block in 5%. As in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the ECG in TTS demonstrates temporal evolution typically with resolution of initial ST-segment elevation (if present), followed by progressive T-wave inversion and QT interval prolongation over several days, with subsequent gradual resolution of T-wave inversion and QT interval prolongation over days to weeks. The initial and subsequent ECG findings are influenced by several variables, including the geographic pattern of left ventricular (LV) ballooning, presence or absence of right ventricular (RV) ballooning, time from symptom onset to presentation, presence of myocardial oedema, and recovery rate of myocardial cellular function.

ST-segment elevation

As with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the location and extent of ST-segment elevation in TTS corresponds to the anatomic location of myocardial injury, most often the mid and apical LV segments. Consequently, ST-segment elevation usually involves precordial, lateral, and apical ECG leads, closely resembling that of anterior STEMI due to left anterior descending coronary occlusion. Lead -aVR (inverse of aVR) representing +30° in the frontal plane is generally aligned with the LV apex, and can be assembled with other leads to create an 'ECG map', useful in comparing the ST-segment elevation pattern of TTS with that of anterior STEMI. ST-segment elevation in TTS is centred on precordial leads V2–V5 and limb leads II and aVR, whereas in anterior STEMI the ST-segment elevation centres on precordial leads V1–V4 and limb leads I and aVL. Several ECG criteria with high sensitivity and specificity have been proposed to reliably distinguish TTS from anterior STEMI. Most focus on ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads, particularly lead V1, as ST-segment elevation in this lead is less pronounced in TTS than in anterior STEMI. ST-segment elevation limited to the inferior leads (II, III, aVF) is distinctly uncommon in TTS. Despite these differences, overlap exists and an urgent coronary angiogram is necessary to differentiate TTS from STEMI with certainty.

### Usefulness of ST depression with T-wave inversion in leads V₄ to V₆ for predicting one-year mortality in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (from the electrocardiographic analysis of the global use of strategies to open occluded coronary arteries IIB trial) [^112pfDYY]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

ST-segment depression (ST-D) on the admission electrocardiogram of patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTEACSs) is associated with higher mortality. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of location of ST-D and T-wave polarity on long-term prognosis of patients with NSTEACS. Electrocardiographic (ECG) and clinical data from 6,770 patients with NSTEACS randomly assigned in the Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) IIB trial were analyzed retrospectively. One-year mortality was correlated with location of ST-D (leads I and aVL; II, III, and aVF; V1 to V3; or V4 to V6) and T-wave polarity. ST-D in any of the ECG locations was associated with higher mortality compared with patients without ST-D. Patients with ST-D and T-wave inversion in leads V4 to V6 had the highest 1-year mortality rate of all groups (16.2%), significantly higher compared with patients with ST-D without T-wave inversion in those leads (9.0%, p = 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that age, hyperlipidemia, Killip class > I, history of myocardial infarction, history of heart failure, history of angina pectoris, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, sum of ST-D (odds ratio 1.061, 95% confidence interval 1.035 to 1.087, p < 0.001), and ST-D with T-wave inversion in leads V4 to V6 (odds ratio 1.374, 95% CI 1.023 to 1.844, p = 0.035) were independent predictors of 1-year mortality. Conversely, ST-D without T-wave inversion in leads V4 to V6 or other ECG presentations were not independent predictors of high 1-year mortality. In conclusion, ST-D with T-wave inversion in leads V4 to V6 on the admission electrocardiogram in patients with NSTEACS identifies those with higher 1-year mortality than for patients with any other ECG presentation.

Calore et al compared the ECG pattern in 80 healthy athletes with anterior TWI with 95 patients affected by HCM and 58 patients by AC. 10 In this study, J‐point elevation < 1 mm in the anterior leads showing TWI and TWI extending beyond V4 remained independent predictors for the diagnosis of either AC or HCM. On the other hand, in athletes with anterior TWI, the combination of J‐point elevation ≥ 1 mm and TWI not extending over V3 excluded a cardiomyopathy, either AC or HCM (100% of sensitivity and 55% of specificity). 10 Conversely, a depressed ST‐segment was considered an electrical marker of cardiac pathology. 6 These results emphasize the importance of assessing the J termination (Jt) and ST‐segment preceding TWI, as further markers to differentiate between physiological cardiac adaptation and a cardiomyopathy. 10 However, there is still a concern regarding the accuracy of J‐point elevation as a discriminant of pathology in athletes with anterior TWI. Finocchiaro et al. reported that a J‐point < 0.1 mV preceding anterior TWI is not specific of AC, because it is present in the majority of healthy individuals, including athletes. 19 Similarly, Brosnan et al studied the electrocardiographic features differentiating AC from athlete's heart and found that J‐point elevation had poor specificity (27%) and accuracy (60%) in identifying healthy athletes, being a poor discriminator of health vs disease condition. 20

In summary, a minimal or absent J‐point elevation (< 1 mm) or a coexistent depressed ST‐segment preceding TWI could suggest the presence of an underlying cardiomyopathy. However, this finding may be observed also in healthy people, so additional ECG alterations suspected for AC, such as low limb lead voltages, prolonged S‐wave upstroke, ventricular ectopy with uncommon morphology, and epsilon waves should be ascertained. On the contrary, findings such as distinct J‐point elevation, ST‐segment elevation, or biphasic T waves more likely represent athlete's heart. Notably, among healthy individuals with anterior TWI, ST‐segment elevation was more common in men than in women regardless of athletic status and, in women with anterior TWI, the ST‐segment was most commonly isoelectric, 6 Finally, a comprehensive evaluation including information on family history and the presence of symptoms provides additional help in differentiating between pathological vs physiological pattern. 10, 14

### Prognostic value of the admission electrocardiogram in patients with unstable angina / non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction treated with very early revascularization [^115ifBX6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

The goals of this study were to determine if very early revascularization might ameliorate the adverse prognosis associated with ST-segment depression in patients with unstable angina/non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.

Methods

In this prospective cohort study, 1450 consecutive patients with unstable angina/non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction were stratified by the presence of ST-segment depression, T-wave inversion, or no changes on the admission electrocardiogram (ECG). All patients underwent coronary angiography and, if appropriate, revascularization within 24 hours after admission. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality.

Results

During up to 59 months of follow-up, the in-hospital mortality rate was 2.1% (19/895) in patients with no ECG changes, 4% (6/136) in those with ST-segment depression, and 0.2% (1/419) in those with T-wave inversion. The cumulative death rate at 36 months was 8.0% (n = 49) in patients with no ECG changes, 19.9% (n = 18) in patients with ST-segment depression, and 5.1% (n = 13) in patients with T-wave inversion (P = 0.0001 by log-rank). After adjustment for potential cofounders, ST-segment depression (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1 to 4.6) and T-wave inversion (HR = 0.44; 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.96) were associated with long-term mortality.

Conclusion

ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion on the admission ECG were important predictors of outcome in patients with unstable angina/non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing very early revascularization. In contrast to the considerable mortality seen in patients with ST-segment depression, T-wave inversion was associated with a more favorable outcome.

### Clinical significance of abnormal T waves in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes [^113EGmDY]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

T-wave abnormalities are common electrocardiographic occurrences in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes. Although these abnormalities are considered relatively benign, physicians use them to guide therapies. The study objective was to examine the prognostic predictive information of T-wave abnormalities in the setting of unstable coronary artery disease. The T-wave abnormality criterion was based on a new set of normal T-wave amplitude limits differentiated by gender, age, electrocardiographic lead, and QRS axis. Four hundred sixty-eight patients suspected of an acute ischemic incident and considered ineligible for reperfusion therapy were included. Thirteen categories of T-wave abnormalities were tested prospectively. The primary 30-day end point was the combination of refractory angina, myocardial infarction, or death. Quantitative T-wave analysis in an electrocardiographic core laboratory revealed 6 of 13 prespecified categories of T-wave abnormalities that were significantly associated with an adverse outcome. T-wave abnormalities had no prognostic value when ST-segment depression was also present, but this occurred in only 7.9% of patients. T-wave abnormalities as the sole manifestation of ischemia were common (74.4%). Patients with abnormal T waves in ≥ 1 of 6 selected abnormality categories (70.3%) had a significantly higher risk of death, acute myocardial infarction, and refractory angina (11% vs 3%; p = 0.018). Thus, T-wave abnormalities in patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes are common and should not automatically be regarded as benign phenomena. Quantitative T- wave analysis provides optimal risk stratification.

Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

Primary and secondary repolarization abnormalities — coexistence and interpretation — may occur concurrently; ventricular hypertrophy is associated with changes in the shape and duration of the ventricular action potential of isolated ventricular cells, and these changes may contribute to ST- and T-wave changes independent of QRS-amplitude changes and prolongation of the QRS complex. A combination of primary and secondary repolarization abnormalities should also be considered when T-wave polarity does not change as anticipated by the changes in the QRS complex.

### Electrocardiographic signs of remote myocardial infarction [^111Fziuj]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Twelve-lead electrocardiogram is an integral part of the evaluation of an acute and a remote myocardial infarction (MI). Electrocardiographic signs of an acute ST-elevation MI are more precise than those of an acute non-ST-elevation MI. Recognition of a remote MI is more difficult because once the repolarization abnormalities (ST-segment and T-wave changes) stabilize after an acute MI resolves, then the Q wave remains as the only universally recognized sign of MI. In addition, there is no specific sign of a non-Q-wave MI or a non-ST-elevation MI, or in fact of an ST-elevation MI that did not result in Q waves. The fragmented QRS (fQRS) is another recently described sign of a remote MI. It is defined by the presence of an additional R wave (R') or notching in the nadir of the S wave, or the presence of > 1 R' (fragmentation) in 2 contiguous leads corresponding to a major coronary artery territory. The specificity of fQRS is inferior to that of a Q wave for an MI scar (89% vs 99%). However, fQRS has a superior sensitivity and a negative predictive value compared with a Q wave. In addition, there is an incremental gain in the sensitivity up to 91.4% when these 2 signs (fQRS and Q wave) are combined. The repolarization abnormalities of MI may also persist indefinitely as a sign of a remote MI in few patients. These abnormalities include persistent ST elevation, ST depression, nonspecific ST-T wave changes, and T-wave inversion.

Electrocardiographic interpretation — criteria and lead selection for suspected acute coronary syndromes: For ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), diagnostic thresholds include "ST-elevation of ≥ 1 mm in ≥ 2 anatomically contiguous leads (measured at the J-point) in all leads other than V2-V3 and ≥ 2 mm in men ≥ 40 y, ≥ 2.5 mm in men < 40 y, and ≥ 1.5 mm in women regardless of age in leads V2-V3". Posterior infarction assessment is supported as "Posterior leads (V7-V9) should be obtained in patients with suspected left circumflex occlusion particularly in the setting of isolated ST-segment depression ≥ 0.5 mm in leads V1-V3". For non–ST-elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS), ischemic findings include "horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression ≥ 0.5 mm in ≥ 2 contiguous leads and/or T-wave inversion > 1 mm in ≥ 2 contiguous leads", and the table clarifies that "Many patients with NSTE-ACS have either nonspecific ST-segment or T-wave changes or a normal ECG. The absence of electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia does not exclude ACS".

### Dynamic changes in electrocardiographic findings between initial and follow-up electrocardiography: the role of the T / QRS ratio [^111r5wxM]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Dynamic changes in electrocardiographic findings between initial and follow-up electrocardiograms (ECGs) have rarely been studied for disease severity and differential diagnosis in non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome. We aimed to determine whether the changes in staple variables on ECG can assist in distinguishing between neuropsychiatric or gastrointestinal disorders (mild non-ischemic disorders), heart failure, and NSTE-ACS (non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome).

Methods

This retrospective study enrolled 1279 patients who presented with ischemic symptoms; were diagnosed with NSTE-ACS, acute heart failure, and mild disorders; and underwent echocardiography and coronary angiography. After performing propensity matching of the ECG follow-up interval, 184 patients with symptom onset within 48 h were included and analyzed.

Results

As a discriminator for NSTE-ACS, the maximum change in the T/QRS ratio in two contiguous leads was superior to the maximum change in ST segment depression, T wave inversion, and ST/T ratio. ECGs of patients with NSTE-ACS and heart failure showed a tendency to increase and decrease the T/QRS ratio change, respectively. Compared with regional wall motion abnormality, the change in troponin I/h and the maximum change in ST segment depression and T-wave inversion, the most deviated T/QRS ratio change from 1 (> 1.5 or < 0.5) in two contiguous leads was the most significant discriminator for disease severity and differential diagnosis (standardized β = 0.545, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

The maximum changes in the T/QRS ratio in two contiguous leads can assist in distinguishing disease severity and acute mimicking disease such as acute heart failure in patients with suspected ACS.

Unstable angina — definition and electrocardiographic features: The definition of unstable angina is largely on the basis of the clinical presentation and is defined as typical chest pain or other ischemic symptoms occurring at rest or with minimal exertion and presumed to be related to an acutely active coronary plaque. In contrast to stable angina, it is often described as severe and as a frank pain, may be new in onset or occur in a crescendo pattern in a patient with a previous stable pattern of angina, and may be associated with new electrocardiographic changes such as transient ST-segment elevation, ST-segment depression, or T-wave inversion, but may be present in the absence of electrocardiographic changes. Several scoring systems exist for determining high-risk patients with ACS.

### Extent of ST-segment depression and cardiac events in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes [^115tZHzU]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

We sought to determine whether the extent of myocardial ischaemia on the admission electrocardiogram (ECG) has independent predictive value for short-term risk stratification of patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACS). Although the presence of ischaemic ECG changes on admission has been shown to predict outcome, the relationship between the extent of ECG changes and the risk of cardiac events is still ill defined.

Methods and Results

We analysed the admission ECGs of 5192 ACS patients enrolled in the GUSTO-IIb trial, without an ECG indication for thrombolysis. ECG tracings showing one or more of the following were eligible: ST-segment depression > 0.5 mm, T-wave inversion > 1 mm, and ST-segment elevation > 0.5 mm but < 1 mm. ECG variables associated with unfavourable 30 day outcomes in a univariable analysis were further assessed in a multivariable logistic regression model including independent clinical predictors. In the multivariable clinical, enzymatic, and ECG model, the sum of ST-segment depression (in millimetres) in all leads was a powerful independent predictor of 30 day death (P < 0.0001), with a continuous increase in risk with the extent of ST-segment depression. The sum of ST-segment depression (P < 0.0001) and the presence of minimal inferior ST-segment elevation (P < 0.0001) or anterior ST-segment elevation (P = 0.0182) were also independent predictors of the composite of death and myocardial infarction or reinfarction. The extent of ST-segment depression showed a highly significant correlation with the prevalence of three-vessel (P < 0.0001) or left main coronary disease (P < 0.0001), and also with the peak levels of creatine kinase (P < 0.0001) during the index episode of ACS.

Conclusion

In patients with NSTE ACS, the sum of ST-segment depression in all ECG leads is a powerful predictor of all-cause mortality at 30 days, independent of clinical variables and correlates with the extent and severity of coronary artery disease. The presence of even minimal (< 1 mm) ST-segment elevation in anterior or inferior leads is independently associated with adverse outcomes.

### Significance of deep T-wave inversions in asymptomatic athletes with normal cardiovascular examinations: practical solutions for managing the diagnostic conundrum [^112k4rRM]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Anterior T-wave inversion

Based on a study of 1700 highly trained athletes aged between 14 and 18 years, T-wave inversion in the anterior leads (V1–V3) are observed in 2.5% of male and female caucasian athletes aged < 16 years and are considered to represent the juvenile ECG pattern (figure 2 A) in the absence of symptoms, a previous history of an intracardiac shunt, a cardiac murmur consistent with an atrial septal defect or a family history of ARVC or premature SCD.T-wave inversion beyond lead V2 is exceptionally rare in caucasian athletes aged > 16 years (0.1%) and are an indication for further investigation. In contrast, T-wave inversion in the anterior leads (V1–V4) is common in adult black athletes (figure 2 B). A recent study examining 904 black athletes and 1819 white athletes aged 14–35 years participating in 22 different sporting disciplines revealed that T-wave inversions were present in up to 25% of athletes and half of these individuals exhibit deep (−0.2 mV) T-wave inversions.T-wave inversions in leads V1–V4 were usually asymmetric or biphasic and frequently proceeded by convex ST-segment elevation. In black athletes, T-wave inversion was only preceded by ST-segment elevation or isoelectric ST-segments but never ST-segment depression. Detailed evaluation of these athletes with echocardiography, exercise stress tests, cardiac MRI and 24 h Holter failed to demonstrate any of the broad phenotypic features of HCM or ARVC, and following an almost 7-year follow-up episode there were no adverse events in black athletes with T-wave inversions in leads V1–V4. The same study also revealed that black controls of similar age had a T-wave inversion prevalence of 10% mainly distributed in the anterior leads indicating the T-wave inversion in leads V1–V4 in black athletes may represent ethnic variation which is exaggerated by exercise. Support for this hypothesis was evidenced by the fact that detraining among several athletes resulted in resolution of T-wave inversions within a few weeks.

### Prognostic value of dynamic electrocardiographic T wave changes in non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome [^1117f3XM]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the relationship between the evolution of T wave inversion (TWI) on the 24–48h postadmission ECG and the patient characteristics, management and clinical outcomes among those with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS).

Methods

We evaluated admission and 24–48h follow-up ECGs of 7201 patients with NSTE-ACS from the prospective, multicentre Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) and Canadian ACS Registry I. We performed multivariable analyses to determine the association between new TWI (on follow-up ECG only), resolved TWI (on admission ECG only) and persistent TWI (on both admission and follow-up ECG) and inhospital and cumulative 6-month all-cause mortality.

Results

Patients with TWI were older, more likely to have cardiovascular risk factors, higher Killip class and GRACE risk scores. After adjustment for known prognostic factors, compared with patients presenting without TWI, new TWI was associated with significantly lower inhospital mortality (OR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.95, p = 0.029), whereas resolved (OR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.75, p = 0.81) and persistent (OR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.11, p = 0.14) TWI did not predict inhospital mortality. No TWI pattern independently predicted inhospital adverse cardiovascular events or cumulative 6-month mortality. In contrast, ST depression on the admission and follow-up ECG were independent predictors of inhospital and 6-month mortality.

Conclusions

Across the spectrum of NSTE-ACS, TWI within 48h of presentation was associated with high-risk clinical features, but its presence or dynamic change did not provide additional prognostic value beyond other established clinical predictors.

### Prevalence and prognostic value of electrocardiographic abnormalities in hypokalemia: a multicenter cohort study [^112EiS9g]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypokalemia is common in hospitalized patients and associated with ECG abnormalities. The prevalence and prognostic value of ECG abnormalities in hypokalemic patients are, however, not well established.

Methods

The study was a multicentered cohort study, including all ault patients with an ECG and potassium level < 4.4 mmol/L recorded at arrival to four emergency departments in Denmark and Sweden. Using computerized measurements from ECGs, we investigated the relationship between potassium levels and heart rate, QRS duration, corrected QT (QTc) interval, ST-segment depressions, T-wave flattening, and T-wave inversion using cubic splines. Within strata of potassium levels, we further estimated the hazard ratio (HR) for 7-day mortality, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and diagnosis of ventricular arrhythmia or cardiac arrest, comparing patients with and without specific ECG abnormalities matched 1:2 on propensity scores.

Results

Among 79,599 included patients, decreasing potassium levels were associated with a concentration-dependent increase in all investigated ECG variables. ECG abnormalities were present in 40% of hypokalemic patients ([K +] < 3.5 mmol/L), with T-wave flattening, ST-segment depression, and QTc prolongation occurring in 27%, 16%, and 14%. In patients with mild hypokalemia ([K +] 3.0–3.4 mmol/L), a heart rate > 100 bpm, ST-depressions, and T-wave inversion were associated with increased HRs for 7-day mortality and ICU admission, whereas only a heart rate > 100 bpm predicted both mortality and ICU admission among patients with [K +] < 3.0 mmol/L. HR estimates were, however, similar to those in eukalemic patients. The low number of events with ventricular arrhythmia limited evaluation for this outcome.

Conclusions

ECG abnormalities were common in hypokalemic patients, but they are poor prognostic markers for short-term adverse events under the current standard of care.

### Electrocardiographic T-wave inversion: differential diagnosis in the chest pain patient [^1166FN3t]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Inverted T waves produced by myocardial ischemia are classically narrow and symmetric. T-wave inversion (TWI) associated with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is morphologically characterized by an isoelectric ST segment that is usually bowed upward (ie, concave) and followed by a sharp symmetric downstroke. The terms coronary T wave and coved T wave have been used to describe these ischemic TWIs. Prominent, deeply inverted, and widely splayed T waves are more characteristic of non-ACS conditions such as juvenile T-wave patterns, left ventricular hypertrophy, acute myocarditis, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, acute pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, bundle branch block, and later stages of pericarditis.

### A negative T-wave in electrocardiogram at 50 years predicted lifetime mortality in a random population-based cohort [^117KpYjm]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Simultaneous other ECG abnormalities were much more common when a negative T‐wave was present, but limited to ST‐segment/junction depression, most frequently, and also Q/QS pattern. The former would be expected since nondiagnostic ST/T changes are the most common ECG changes overall. 30 Also conditions causing ECG changes often concomitantly affect ST‐junction/segment levels and T‐wave axis. Thus, we found ST‐segment/junction depression almost 14 times more common when a negative T‐wave was present. Regarding Q/QS pattern, we cannot completely exclude prior silent MI in our cohort, although all confirmed MIs were excluded. Also, a minor negative T‐wave was much more frequent than a major, making up more than 60% of cases, similar to previously reported. 13

4.2 A negative T‐wave as an independent lifetime predictor for risk for death and cardiovascular death

The higher event rate for all‐cause and CV mortality associated with a negative T‐wave was consistent with the presence of more hypertension in this group, and of ECG abnormalities, in general, as markers of compromized CV health. 24, 25, 26 The association of a negative T‐wave with CV death, but not non‐CV death, strengthens its role as a lifetime marker for increased CV risk.

Consistent with the above, the HR for death in the presence of a negative T‐wave was also significantly elevated both for all‐cause and CV death, almost doubled for the latter. The increased risk persisted after exclusion of concomitant Q/QS pattern and concomitant ST‐junction/segment depression. This implies that a negative T‐wave marks an elevated risk of death, particularly CV death, and the risk persists, also in the absence of other ECG abnormalities. This is an important finding since the significance of isolated negative T‐waves in an asymptomatic individual has been unclear.

### The greatest benefit of enoxaparin over unfractionated heparin in acute coronary syndromes is achieved in patients presenting with ST-segment changes: the enoxaparin in non-Q-wave coronary events (ESSENCE) electrocardiogram core laboratory substudy [^112cT4rC]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

We undertook a prospective electrocardiogram (ECG) substudy in the ESSENCE trial and hypothesized that patient subgroups with ST-segment deviation would experience greater benefit from enoxaparin, as compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH).

Methods

Of the 3171 patients in the trial, 3087 had a qualifying ECG available for analysis by the core laboratory. Patients were divided into 4 mutually exclusive groups based upon the qualifying ECG: (1) ST-segment elevation, (2) ST-segment depression, (3) T-wave inversions, or (4) others.

Results

The 30-day and 1-year primary outcomes (death, myocardial infarction, or recurrent angina) were significantly lower among patients with ST elevation or ST depression who received enoxaparin, as compared with UFH (20.8% vs 28.0%, P = 0.0019 and 32% vs 40.4%, P = 0.0011, respectively). The greatest absolute benefit of enoxaparin over UFH was seen in patients with ST depression (primary end point at 30 days, 24.6% vs 32.4%, P = 0.018; at 1 year, 35.5% vs 44.5%, P = 0.012).

Conclusion

Specific recognition of patients with ST-segment depression appears to identify those not only at high risk for adverse outcome, but also patients most likely to derive the greatest benefit from enoxaparin, as compared with UFH therapy.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^116d8aj8]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) — clinical features, ECG, and biomarkers: TTS can mimic myocardial infarction (MI) and is found in 1% to 2% of patients presenting with suspected ST-elevation MI (STEMI); its onset is often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress such as bereavement, and over 90% of patients are postmenopausal women. Cardiovascular complications occur in 50% of patients, and the inpatient mortality is similar to STEMI (4% to 5%); ST-segment elevation is frequent (44%) and is usually widespread across the lateral and precordial leads beyond a single coronary artery distribution, whereas ST-segment depression occurs in < 10% of patients and after 12 to 24 hours deep, symmetric T wave inversion and QTc prolongation are typically observed. There are usually transient elevations in cardiac troponin (cTn) levels (> 95% of cases), but the peak cTn values observed are modest and contrast with the large territory of electrocardiogram (ECG) changes or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.

### Analyzing prominent T waves and ST-segment abnormalities in acute myocardial infarction [^1156hHAM]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperacute T waves and the non-concave appearance of the ST segment are early changes that may be seen on the electrocardiogram (ECG) in an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patient. There are specific morphological changes in these ECG findings that can help distinguish them from other conditions with similar ECG patterns. The differential diagnosis of prominent T waves and ST-segment elevation is well known, however, certain tools to distinguish ECG patterns with various etiologies have been developed and proven useful to the emergency physician.

Objectives

1) To discuss and review the more common differential diagnosis of prominent T waves and how to identify the hyperacute T wave of AMI. 2) To review the distinction and determination of a concave and non-concave ST segment that may be initially overlooked.

Case Report

A 42-year-old woman with minimal cardiac risk factors developed an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) that illustrates the evolution of early and classic ECG changes associated with her infarct.

Conclusions

The classic STEMI is ingrained in the emergency physician's mind, however, sometimes other lesser known and obvious ECG patterns can present early on in the evolution of disease, and these morphological patterns should be identified and treated accordingly.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^117GMN3p]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation and tachyarrhythmias — electrocardiographic changes and myocardial injury attribution — require caution in MI classification. In atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, "ST-segment depression or T wave inversion may occur in the absence of CAD". Mechanisms such as "cardiac memory" and tachycardia-induced supply–demand mismatch may explain these findings. Therefore, "a patient with new-onset atrial fibrillation, elevated baseline cTn concentration, and new ST-segment depression should not automatically be classified as type 2 MI without additional information". In this setting, "signs of overt ischemic symptoms, the timing of symptoms relative to atrial fibrillation onset, a changing pattern of cTn, and imaging and/or angiographic findings may be helpful", and "in the absence of evidence for myocardial ischemia, the etiology of the elevated cTn values should be attributed to myocardial injury".

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^1112igCX]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Electrocardiographic detection of myocardial infarction — an electrocardiogram (ECG) "should be acquired and interpreted promptly (ie, target within 10 minutes) after first medical contact", and "prehospital ECGs reduce the time to diagnosis and treatment, and can facilitate the triage of STEMI patients… if within the recommended time interval (120 minutes from STEMI diagnosis)". For ongoing symptoms or a nondiagnostic tracing, "recording several standard ECGs… at 15–30 minute intervals for the initial 1–2 hours, or the use of continuous computer-assisted 12-lead ECG recording… is reasonable". Certain patterns carry prognostic/diagnostic implications: "ST-segment depression ≥ 1 mm in 6 leads… is suggestive evidence of multivessel disease or left main disease", while a comparison tracing helps but "should not delay the decision for treatment". Early ischemic changes include "increased hyperacute T wave amplitude… in at least 2 contiguous leads", and infarction evolution is reflected as "the development of new Q waves" indicating necrosis that "starts minutes/hours after the myocardial insult", with "transient Q waves" sometimes seen during acute ischemia or "(rarely) during acute MI with successful reperfusion".

### Prognostic value of admission electrocardiographic findings in non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^1154dGys]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most accessible and widely used diagnostic tool when patients are suspected to have acute coronary syndrome (ACS). 1 Admission ECG findings may also provide prognostic information and rapid risk assessment in ACS patients, 2, 3 especially those with non‐ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), a diagnosis applied to a heterogeneous group of patients with different clinical characteristics and outcomes. ECG findings of NSTEMI at presentation show several variations, including transient ST‐segment elevation (TSTE), ST‐segment depression (STD), T‐wave inversion (TWI), and no ischemic changes (NIC). Previous studies have shown that the presence of STD is associated with an increased risk of short‐ and long‐term cardiovascular (CV) events, 4, 5 but studies of TWI have shown inconsistent results. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Limited data are available on patients with TSTE and NIC. Risk stratification remains crucial to selecting appropriate management strategies for NSTEMI patients. Therefore, systematically investigating these four ECG subgroups would help clinicians better risk‐stratify patients and yield additional insight into the selection of appropriate treatment. Furthermore, current guidelines for NSTEMI patients recommend invasive reperfusion to improve clinical outcomes, 12, 13 but the effect of invasive management on the prognostic value of admission ECG data in contemporary practice has not been studied. It is still unclear whether the prognostic value of admission ECG findings differs between patients with or without invasive management.

In this study, we performed a retrospective analysis of NSTE‐ACS patients in the Acute Coronary Syndrome Quality Improvement in Kerala (ACS QUIK) trial, comparing patient characteristics, treatments, and outcomes between four ECG subgroups with the aim of systematically assessing the prognostic value of qualitative ECG findings at presentation. We also performed a subset analysis of patients with or without invasive reperfusion in order to clarify the influence of such treatment on the prognostic value of admission ECG findings.

### Quantitative T-wave alternans analysis for guiding medical therapy: an underexploited opportunity [^115usafv]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Reducing the toll of sudden cardiac death (SCD) remains a major challenge in cardiology, as it is the leading cause of adult mortality in the industrially developed world, claiming 310,000 lives annually in the United States alone. The main contemporary noninvasive index of cardiovascular risk, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), has not proved adequately reliable, as the majority of individuals who die suddenly have relatively preserved cardiac mechanical function. Monitoring of T-wave alternans (TWA), a beat-to-beat fluctuation in ST-segment or T-wave morphology, is an attractive approach to risk stratification on both scientific and clinical grounds, as this ECG phenomenon has been shown using the FDA-cleared Spectral and Modified Moving Average methods to assess risk for cardiovascular mortality including SCD in studies enrolling > 12,000 individuals with depressed or preserved LVEF. The evidence supporting TWA as a therapeutic target is reviewed.

Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction — patterns indicating left anterior descending artery involvement and aVR prognostic value note that absence of ST-elevation in precordial leads with tall, symmetrical T waves, upsloping ST-segment depression > 1 mm at the J-point, and in most cases ST-segment elevation (> 1 mm) in lead aVR or symmetrical, deep (> 2 mm) T wave inversions in anterior precordial leads are associated with significant left anterior descending artery occlusion. ST-elevation in lead aVR > 1 mm may accompany anterior or inferior STEMI and is associated with increased 30-day mortality in acute MI.

Additional ECG findings consistent with acute coronary artery occlusion — diagnostic cues — note that the application of STEMI ECG criteria on a standard 12-lead ECG alone will miss a significant minority of patients who have acute coronary occlusion; therefore, the ECG should be closely examined for subtle changes such as hyperacute T waves or ST-segment elevation < 1 mm, particularly when combined with reciprocal ST-segment depression, as concomitant reciprocal ST-segment depression may be visually more evident than ST-segment elevation; if present, these patients should be evaluated for emergent coronary angiography.

Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

ST-segment and T-wave repolarization abnormalities — primary versus secondary definitions — are delineated as follows: Primary repolarization abnormalities are the result of changes in the shape and/or duration of the repolarization phases of the transmembrane action potential and occur without changes in depolarization; they may be localized or diffuse and may be caused by ischemia, myocarditis, drugs, toxins, electrolyte abnormalities including serum calcium and potassium, and an abrupt change in heart rate, hyperventilation, changes in body position, catecholamines, sympathetic stimulation or ablation of the stellate ganglion, and temperature changes. Secondary repolarization abnormalities directly reflect changes in the sequence and/or duration of ventricular depolarization, manifested electrocardiographically as changes in QRS shape and/or duration, with examples including bundle-branch blocks, ventricular preexcitation, and ectopic and paced ventricular complexes.

### Interpretation of T-wave inversion in physiological and pathological conditions: current state and future perspectives [^111y2EJ6]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

6 FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

The interpretation of TWI in athletes and their clinical management can be sometimes challenging. Although several studies have been conducted with the aim of interpreting TWI in this specific population, knowledge gaps still exist. In particular, few data are available on the clinical significance of isolated TWI in the inferior leads. Furthermore, despite the large number of young subjects practicing sport, the literature is limited also in the specific setting of children engaged in competitions which exhibit dynamic electrocardiographic changes — and particularly in the anterior precordial leads — with a different interpretation in comparison with adults. Finally, the clinical course of athletes with abnormal TWI and negative/inconclusive cardiac imaging is another area of interest with limited data currently available. Further research is needed in these different settings in order to help physicians managing athletes with TWI.

### Interpretation of T-wave inversion in physiological and pathological conditions: current state and future perspectives [^111HpS1V]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The presence of T-wave inversion (TWI) at 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in competitive athletes is one of the major diagnostic challenges for sports physicians and consulting cardiologists. Indeed, while the presence of TWI may be associated with some benign conditions and it may be occasionally seen in healthy athletes presenting signs of cardiac remodeling, it may also represent an early sign of an underlying, concealed structural heart disease or life-threatening arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies, which may be responsible for exercise-related sudden cardiac death (SCD). The interpretation of TWI in athletes is complex and the inherent implications for the clinical practice represent a conundrum for physicians. Accordingly, the detection of TWI should be viewed as a potential red flag on the ECG of young and apparently healthy athletes and warrants further investigations because it may represent the initial expression of cardiomyopathies that may not be evident until many years later and that may ultimately be associated with adverse outcomes. The aim of this review is, therefore, to report an update of the literature on TWI in athletes, with a specific focus on the interpretation and management.

### AHA / ACCF / HRS recommendations for the standardization and interpretation of the electrocardiogram: part V: electrocardiogram changes associated with cardiac chamber hypertrophy: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association electrocardiography and arrhythmias committee, council on clinical cardiology; the American college of cardiology foundation; and the Heart Rhythm Society: endorsed by the international society for computerized electrocardiology [^114d8qqB]. Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

Right ventricular hypertrophy — interpretation and performance note that RVH causes "a displacement of the QRS vector toward the right and anteriorly" and "often causes a delay in the R-wave peak in right precordial leads", so "the ability of the ECG to detect RVH may be expected to be low". Sensitivity is "generally low", though some criteria have "high specificity", with accuracy greatest "in congenital heart disease", intermediate "in acquired heart disease and primary pulmonary hypertension in adults", and lowest "in chronic lung disease". ECG patterns include one similar to incomplete RBBB and another with predominantly tall R waves in right precordial leads; both are "associated with right axis deviation", and are frequently associated with ST depression and T-wave inversion in right precordial leads, better termed "secondary ST-T abnormality" than "strain". In chronic nonobstructive lung disease there is often "right axis deviation and deep S waves in the precordial leads"; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease produces a characteristic pattern with "low voltage in the limb leads", a frontal plane QRS axis that is "rightward, superior, or indeterminate", a rightward P-wave axis "greater than 60 degrees", "persistent S waves in all precordial leads", and "low R-wave amplitude in V6", and "RVH is suggested… only if R-wave amplitude in V1 is relatively increased". For diagnosis, "Right axis deviation and prominent anterior forces in the right precordial leads should be required… in nearly all cases", but "such features occur for various reasons other than RVH", so "The use of ancillary clinical information, therefore, plays a greater role".

### Ethnic differences in the ST segment of the electrocardiogram: a comparative study among six ethnic groups [^1112EeXE]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Deviation of the ST segment of the electrocardiogram (ECG) may signify infarction or ischemia. Prior studies suggest that normal ECG patterns may differ among ethnic groups. We retrospectively reviewed the first thousand medical files of a multiethnic community, where all individuals shared similar living conditions. Only healthy adults, aged 15 to 60 years, were included. Along with age, the most common causes for exclusion were diabetes, hypertension, and ischemic heart disease. A total of 597 subjects (349 men) were included: 350 Saudi Arabians, 39 Filipinos, 95 Indians, 17 Sri-Lankans, and 57 Caucasians. Twenty men and one woman had an ECG pattern of early repolarization (ST segment elevation with upward concavity, notching on QRS, and large symmetrical T wave), with no difference in incidence among ethnic groups. ST segment elevation (2 mm in any of the leads V1-V4, or 1 mm in any of the other leads) without criteria of early repolarization occurred in 11.58%, 13.46%, 3.57%, 4.35%, 11.76%, 7.32% of Saudi, Indian, Jordanian, Filipino, Sri-Lankan, and Caucasian men, respectively (P = 0.61). Only one Jordanian and 2 Indian women had this pattern. However, Filipino men had higher median ST segment levels than others in leads V1 and V3. Among women, the median ST segment level was iso-electric in all leads in all ethnic groups. Only 3 subjects had ST segment depression > 1 mm. Significant ST segment elevation is common in normal healthy men but may not fulfill criteria for early repolarization; it has no ethnic predilection. ST segment elevation is uncommon in normal women. ST segment depression is a rare finding in healthy adults regardless of ethnic origin.

### Sensitive troponin assay and the classification of myocardial infarction [^117PDw18]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical Characteristics

Compared with patients with type 1 myocardial infarction, patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury were older, had worse renal function, and were more likely to be female (Table 1). Ninety-seven percent of patients with type 1 myocardial infarction had a physician diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome, whereas patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury had a wide range of alternative clinical diagnoses (Online Figure 2). The majority of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction presented with chest pain and had a clear alternative primary diagnosis. Patients with myocardial injury were more likely to present with dyspnea, syncope, or confusion. The most common conditions predisposing to type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury were tachyarrhythmia, heart failure, and respiratory disorders (Table 1).

Peak troponin concentrations were higher in patients with type 1 myocardial infarction at 2420 ng/L compared with 140 ng/L and 130 ng/L in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury, respectively. The majority of patients had a ≥ 20% change in troponin concentration on serial sampling, and this was similar across all groups. Patients with type 1 myocardial infarction were more likely to have ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram, whereas ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion were more common in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury. The clinical characteristics of patients with type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction did not differ between the validation and implementation phases (data not shown).

### T-wave inversions and the role of de-training in the differentiation of athlete's heart from pathology: is 6 months too long? [^111qgBmQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Electrocardiographic changes are common in athletes. Differentiation of a physiological from a pathological substrate is important as ECG changes may indicate underlying cardiac disease placing the athlete at increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Deep T-wave inversions are uncommon in Caucasian athletes however; appear more prevalent in black athletes. Irrespective of the ethnic origin of the athlete, deep T-wave inversions require thorough follow-up. At present, 6 months de-training is recommended to assist in the differentiation of physiologic and pathologic changes where a definitive diagnosis is elusive through standard diagnostic techniques. This case study examines findings from a black and a Caucasian athlete presenting with deep T-wave inversions following a brief (ca.3 week) period of de-training resulting in normalisation of T-wave. These cases suggest that a shorter period of time may be sufficient in differentiating physiological from pathological mechanisms for deep T-wave inversions.

### T-wave abnormality as electrocardiographic signature of myocardial edema in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes [^114vbRCf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

ECG Definitions

Definitions for T‐wave abnormality and ST depression were in accordance with "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram" by the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and Heart Rhythm Association consensus statement. 14 Isolated T‐wave abnormality was considered present if the T wave was inverted (at least 0.1 mV), isoelectric, or biphasic in leads V3 to V6, aVL, I, and II. In leads V1, aVR and III, T‐wave abnormalities were not evaluated, as those can be found as normal variants. 14 Isolated ST‐depression was defined as the presence of at least 0.1 mV depression from the J point in at least 2 contiguous leads. 14 ST depression and T‐wave abnormality were considered to be simultaneously present when the T wave extended from the J point+60 ms until complete ventricular repolarization. Presence of ST‐segment and/or T‐wave abnormality constituted an "ischemic ECG". A "nonischemic ECG" was defined as absence of any ST‐segment and/or T‐wave abnormality. ECG profiles were classified either as a dichotomous variable (ie, ischemic versus normal/nonischemic ECG) or a nominal variable according to individual pattern of presentation: isolated T‐wave abnormality, isolated ST depression, ST depression+T‐wave abnormality (when simultaneously present), or normal/nonischemic ECG. When T‐wave abnormality was present, the number of leads with abnormal T waves was also recorded. Data on PR, QRS, QTc intervals, and QRS angle were also collected.

ECG exclusion criteria were left bundle branch block, atrial flutter, paced rhythm, low voltage, poor ECG quality, and ventricular tachycardia. The presence of a left ventricular hypertrophy strain pattern was also excluded from the analysis. Left ventricular hypertrophy strain was defined as the presence of a downsloping convex ST segment concomitantly with an inverted asymmetrical T‐wave in leads V5 and V6. 15 Further, whenever possible, we compared the ECG with previous records to ensure that abnormalities represented dynamic ischemic changes.

Two expert physicians (S.F.S. and A.C.) blinded to patient clinical and imaging data independently interpreted the ECGs, and disagreements were resolved by consensus.

### Usefulness of the presenting electrocardiogram in predicting myocardial salvage with thrombolytic therapy in patients with a first acute myocardial infarction [^116k9S8u]. European Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

Patients with Q waves and T-wave inversion are generally at a later stage of the infarction process than patients without these changes. Our aim was to investigate whether a single assessment of electrocardiographic parameters at presentation would predict the proportion of myocardium salvageable by thrombolytic therapy.

Methods and Results

Electrocardiographic algorithms to calculate the potential and final infarct size have been developed and allow the proportion of myocardium salvageable with therapy to be calculated. This was measured in 146 patients with acute myocardial infarction who had angiography at a median of 91 min after streptokinase. The relationship between myocardial salvage and the electrocardiographic parameters at presentation (Q waves, T-wave inversion, quantitative ST segment changes, and the initial QRS score), was examined together with the 90-min angiographic parameters (TIMI flow grade and collateral grade), clinical parameters (haemodynamics and age), and time to therapy. Parameters that correlated with myocardial salvage included the initial QRS score (r = -0.56, P < 0.0001), Q wave grade (r = -0.36, P < 0.0001), number of leads with ST depression (r = 0.28, P < 0.001), maximum ST depression (r = 0.27, P < 0.01), T-inversion grade (r = -0.26, P < 0.01), and TIMI flow grade at 90 min (r = 0.21, P < 0.02). The time from symptom onset to thrombolytic therapy did not correlate with salvage (r = -0.09). On multivariate analysis, only the initial QRS score and T-inversion grade on the initial electrocardiogram were independent predictors of salvage (multivariate r using both variables combined = 0.57, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

The QRS score and T-wave inversion grade on the presenting electrocardiogram provide important information in predicting myocardial salvage. These parameters may help triage patients to appropriate therapies.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Electrocardiogram interpretation and repeat testing — supportive points: A normal or unchanged electrocardiogram (ECG) is reasonably useful but not sufficient at ruling out acute coronary syndrome (ACS), decision-making should not be based solely on a single normal or nondiagnostic ECG, and up to 6% of patients with evolving ACS are discharged from the emergency department (ED) with a normal ECG; when the initial ECG is normal or without ST elevation, hyperacute T waves, left bundle branch block, or ST depression, serial ECGs should be performed and the timing for repeat ECG should be guided by symptoms; when ST-elevation is present on the initial ECG, management should follow the prescribed STEMI treatment algorithms, and if ST depression is identified on the initial ECG, management should follow the NSTE-ACS guidelines; a normal ECG may be associated with left circumflex or right coronary artery occlusions and posterior wall ischemia, therefore right-sided ECG leads should be considered when such lesions are suspected; an initial normal ECG does not exclude ACS and patients with an initial normal ECG should have a repeat ECG if symptoms are ongoing until other diagnostic testing rules out ACS.

### How to evaluate premature ventricular beats in the athlete: critical review and proposal of a diagnostic algorithm [^112xewzr]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Electrocardiography

The ECG is an essential part of the evaluation of athletes with PVBs because concomitant repolarisation/depolarisation abnormalities may provide important information on a possible underlying cardiomyopathy or channelopathy.

The most relevant ECG abnormalities which are consistent with an at-risk heart muscle disorder include repolarisation abnormalities such as T-wave inversion and ST segment depression, pathological Q-waves, intraventricular conduction disturbances, ventricular pre-excitation and a long QT interval. These ECG abnormalities are classified by current recommendations for interpretation of the athlete's ECG as abnormal and training-unrelated ECG findings that warrant additional investigation to exclude myocardial disease. The association between a PVB with a LBBB morphology and other ECG abnormalities such as T-wave inversion, prolonged S-wave upstroke (≥ 55 ms from the nadir of the S-wave to the end of the QRS complex in leads V1–V3) or a epsilon wave (small positive deflection or notch between the end of the QRS complex and onset of the T-wave in leads V1–V3) in the non-ectopic beats is highly suggestive of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy(figure 4). On the other hand, PVBs with an RBBB pattern > 130 ms and negative T-waves in the left precordial leads (V5–V6) in the non-ectopic beats should raise the suspicion of a LV myocardial disease, such as dilated cardiomyopathy, non-ischaemic LV scar (figure 3), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, left-dominant arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy or arrhythmic mitral valve prolapse (figure 5). Athletes with PVBs and concomitant repolarisation/depolarisation abnormalities require an indepth cardiovascular evaluation aimed to confirm (or exclude) such heart muscle diseases.

### Electrocardiogram interpretation in general practice [^112vAF8z]. Family Practice (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a common diagnostic test available to the GP in the evaluation of patients with cardiac complaints. In daily clinical practice it is important for GPs to know the sensitivity and specificity of their ECG interpretation skills.

Objectives

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the ECG interpretation skills of GPs and the value of automatic ECG recorder interpretations in general practice.

Methods

A total of 902 ECGs were recorded in a random sample of the population aged 31–51 years in the district of Ebeltoft, Denmark, from December 1991 to June 1992. They were interpreted automatically by an interpretive ECG recorder and by the GPs in the clinic in Ebeltoft, with a cardiologists interpretation as a gold standard. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of diagnoses were calculated.

Results

Overall, the sensitivity of abnormal diagnoses made by the GPs (69.8%) was significantly lower (P < 0.001) than that of diagnoses made by the interpretive ECG recorder (84.4%). The overall specificity of abnormal diagnoses made by the GP (85.7%) was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than that achieved by the interpretive ECG recorder (75.6%).

Conclusions

GPs in this study were good at correcting false-positive diagnoses made by the interpretive ECG recorder. In order to avoid unfortunate reclassifications of true-positive to false-negative diagnoses, GPs are recommended to pay special attention to the diagnoses of ST-segment deviation, T-wave inversion or the presence of Q-waves made by interpretive ECG recorders, when ECGs are used in individual risk assessment.

### Acute pericarditis: rapid evidence review [^114weJcn]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute pericarditis is defined as inflammation of the pericardium and occurs in approximately 4.4% of patients who present to the emergency department for nonischemic chest pain, with a higher prevalence in men. Although there are numerous etiologies of pericarditis, most episodes are idiopathic and the cause is presumed to be viral. Diagnosis of pericarditis requires at least two of the following criteria: new or worsening pericardial effusion, characteristic pleuritic chest pain, pericardial friction rub, or electrocardiographic changes, including new, widespread ST elevations or PR depressions. Pericardial friction rubs are highly specific but transient, and they have been reported in 18% to 84% of patients with acute pericarditis. Classic electrocardiographic findings include PR-segment depressions; diffuse, concave, upward ST-segment elevations without reciprocal changes; and T-wave inversions. Transthoracic echocardiography should be performed in all patients with acute pericarditis to characterize the size of effusions and evaluate for complications. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first-line treatment option. Glucocorticoids should be reserved for patients with contraindications to first-line therapy and those who are pregnant beyond 20 weeks' gestation or have other systemic inflammatory conditions. Colchicine should be used in combination with first- or second-line treatments to reduce the risk of recurrence. Patients with a higher risk of complications should be admitted to the hospital for further workup and treatment.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings consistent with ischemia — In patients with ischemic symptoms, ST-segment elevation in lead augmented vector right with or without V1 combined with multilead ST-segment depression represents a high-risk pattern associated with high morbidity and mortality and often reflects diffuse ischemia from left main and/or 3-vessel disease; in approximately 10% of cases, acute coronary occlusion is present. Emergent coronary angiography should be considered in patients with persistent ischemic symptoms or ECG changes after treatment or if there is hemodynamic instability. Ischemic ST-segment depression is specific but not sensitive for ACS, and in the setting of ischemic symptoms it should prompt treatment consistent with the 2014 NSTE-ACS guidelines.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Preoperative 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) — Recommendations for noncardiac surgery (NCS) are as follows: For patients with known coronary heart disease, significant arrhythmia, peripheral arterial disease, cerebrovascular disease, other significant structural heart disease, or symptoms of CVD undergoing elevated-risk surgery, a preoperative resting 12-lead ECG is reasonable to establish a preoperative baseline and guide perioperative management (2a B-NR). In patients undergoing NCS with a preoperative ECG exhibiting new abnormalities, further evaluation is reasonable to refine assessment of cardiovascular risk (2a B-NR), and abnormalities may include ST-segment elevation, ST depression, T-wave inversions, left ventricular hypertrophy, significant pathologic Q-waves, Mobitz type II or higher atrioventricular block, bundle branch block, QT prolongation, or atrial fibrillation. For asymptomatic patients undergoing elevated-risk surgeries without known CVD, a preoperative resting 12-lead ECG may be considered to establish a baseline and guide perioperative management (2b B-NR). For asymptomatic patients undergoing low-risk surgical procedures, a routine preoperative resting 12-lead ECG is not recommended to improve outcomes (3: No benefit, B-NR).

### Non-ST-Segment elevation myocardial infarction: a novel and robust approach for early detection of patients at risk [^112HvWzh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction

As the name states, NSTEMI is myocardial infarction in which the elevation — or for that matter, depression — of ST segments is not significantly different from normal and thus the reason that the condition is not identified in patients presenting with chest pain. Typically, chest-pain patients without significantly abnormal ST elevation are monitored, potentially for hours, until other tests confirm the presence of acute infarction (eg, elevated troponin levels). There are several explanations that account for the absence of abnormal ST elevation in acute MI. These include numerous possibilities: that the infarcts may be relatively small; that the location of the infarcts may be in locations only weakly sensed by the lead fields of the standard 12-lead ECG; or that the infarct is slowly developing. Importantly, this does not mean that the QRS and ST-T waves of the ECG do not change dynamically during the infarct's time course. At the cellular level, acute ischemia results in changes in action potential amplitude, duration, triangularization or sloping of the plateau, and even reduction in action potential (AP) upstroke velocity in affected cells. Consequently, the ECG shows a dynamic progression of changes in ST level and slope as well as T wave amplitude and morphology, in addition to widening of the QRS as a consequence of conduction slowing — all with different time course and magnitude. In NSTEMI all of these may be present although much more subtly than in ST-segment myocardial infarction, in which the ST segments show definitive elevation. Thus, any method that is sensitive to and quantitates these changes in QRS and ST-T waveform should greatly improve the sensitivity of the test for infarction as well as drastically reduce the time required to diagnose the syndrome.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Prognostic and management value of preoperative ECG — The prognostic significance of several electrocardiographic abnormalities has been identified in observational studies, including arrhythmias, significant pathologic Q-waves, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, ST-segment depressions, QT prolongation, and bundle branch blocks, yet most studies report little to no added prognostication beyond clinical risk assessment. Notable abnormalities that may prompt further information, consultation, or testing include significant Q-waves, LV hypertrophy, ST-segment elevation, ST depression, T-wave inversion, Mobitz type II or higher block, bundle branch blocks, atrial fibrillation (AF), or QT interval prolongation; the likelihood of abnormalities increases with age and risk factors, but a standard age or risk factor cutoff has not been defined, and the optimal time interval between obtaining a 12-lead ECG and elective NCS is unknown. In general, an abnormal preoperative ECG may not substantially alter perioperative management, except for second-degree Mobitz type II or higher atrioventricular block, and recognition of a prolonged QT interval may inform selection of anesthetics, postoperative antiemetics, or antibiotic therapy. Clinical risk assessment using validated tools is more useful to guide management than a single resting ECG; in low-risk patients, a routine preoperative ECG has little effect and should be omitted from standard preoperative evaluation, with one study of 89 892 patients showing cancellation of 13 (0.004%) treatments in low-risk patients (11 with new AF and 2 with ischemia or previous infarction), only 1 subsequent abnormal cardiac workup, and the remaining 11 ultimately undergoing NCS without complications.

Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

Secondary repolarization abnormalities — recognition and vector relationships — are characterized by directions opposite to depolarization vectors: In left bundle-branch block, the ST-segment and T-wave vectors are generally directed opposite to the mean QRS vector; in right bundle-branch block they are directed opposite to the slow terminal component of the QRS complex; and in ventricular preexcitation, ST-T changes are directed opposite to the delta wave of the QRS complex. When the direction of the QRS axis is normal, an abnormal direction of the T-wave axis is generally an indication of primary repolarization abnormalities. The practical utility of the ventricular gradient in differentiating primary from secondary repolarization abnormalities has not been demonstrated. With transiently altered ventricular conduction from ectopic ventricular complexes or transient bundle-branch blocks, secondary ST- and T-wave changes usually revert promptly to the prior pattern, whereas some secondary repolarization changes take longer (hours or days) to develop and to dissipate, such as those associated with prolonged ventricular pacing.

### Cardiac memory: an under-recognised cause of deep T wave inversion in a patient presenting with chest pain [^1129kWtx]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

T wave inversion (TWI) has many differential diagnoses with acute myocardial ischaemia being the highest on the list of potential causes. Cardiac T wave memory is a benign, under-recognised and clinically important phenomenon seen after periods of altered ventricular conduction. After normal ventricular conduction is restored, the T wave 'remembers' and mirrors the direction of the wide QRS complex. Therefore, negative T waves are seen in leads that had negative wide QRS complexes. We describe the case of a 60-year-old truck driver with chest pain, deep TWI and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. After ruling out significant myocardial ischaemia, it was crucial to determine the cause of his T wave changes to provide reassurance and provide commercial license medical clearance. While it is currently a diagnosis of exclusion, it remains an important clinical entity for clinicians to recognise to provide an explanation for certain T wave changes to avoid future unnecessary cardiac testing.

5.3 Implications for sport eligibility

The presence of TWI is not, per se, a diagnosis of a cardiomyopathy. Therefore, in the presence of TWI, the physician should prompt the investigations aimed to exclude, or confirm, the presence of an underlying pathologic condition, as depicted in the flowchart (Figure 4).

FIGURE 4
Proposed algorithm for evaluation of athletes with T‐wave inversion. * Further investigations include — but are not limited to — echocardiography, stress testing, 12‐lead Holter ECG and cardiac magnetic resonance. The indication to these diagnostic tests is based on a clinical decision and takes into account the personal and family history of the athlete as well as the results of the previous examinations; Beyond sports eligibility or disqualification, a periodical follow‐up is usually needed in most of these cases, with a timeline based on the clinical characteristics of the athlete. Sports eligibility and disqualification should be guided by the recent position statement of the Sport Cardiology Section of the European Association of Preventive Cardiology. 34 ECG, electrocardiogram

Sport eligibility, in athletes with TWI, must be established according to the presence of the concomitant cardiac condition, and the sport participated, as suggested by the current ESC recommendations. 34

It is of notice that, in most instances, a markedly abnormal ECG may not reveal any feature of cardiomyopathy. In this case, the athlete should not be considered as affected by a cardiac disease and therefore, no restrictions in his/her lifestyle, including participation in competitive sport should be advocated. Nevertheless, considering the potential for developing a cardiomyopathy later in life, regular follow‐up is highly recommended (annually, during adolescence, and young adulthood). 2 Indeed, while cardiac imaging can be negative at the first clinical evaluations in children/adolescents with suspected TWI, a pathological LV hypertrophy can be detected later in the life in athletes with TWI and a strict clinical follow‐up is recommended for this purpose. Athletes should also be educated with respect to the identification of incident cardiac symptoms as a red flag requiring re‐evaluation.

### Interpretation of T-wave inversion in physiological and pathological conditions: current state and future perspectives [^113pYyj5]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

T‐wave inversion (TWI) is defined as negative T‐wave of ≥ 1 mm in depth in two or more contiguous leads, with exclusion of leads aVR, III, and V1. 1 The presence of TWI at 12‐lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in competitive athletes is one of the major diagnostic challenges for sports physicians and consulting cardiologists.

The interpretation of TWI in athletes is complex and the inherent implications for the clinical practice represent a conundrum for physicians. TWI may be occasionally seen in healthy athletes presenting signs of cardiac remodeling, such as left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, atrial dilation, increase in ventricular cavity size, which may occasionally overlap with those of life‐threatening arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies. In some cases, the identification of TWI should be viewed as a red flag on the ECG of young and apparently healthy athletes and warrants further investigations, having in mind that it may represent the initial expression of cardiomyopathies that may not be evident until many years later and that may ultimately be associated with adverse outcomes. 2 The aim of this review is, therefore, to report an update of the literature on TWI in athletes, with a specific focus on the interpretation and management, including the advice for eligibility and/or disqualification from competitions.

For a proper interpretation of TWI patterns in athletes, it is crucial to consider primarily the TWI localization, which may be helpful to identify specific cardiac pathologies, in association with the family and personal history and the clinical correlates of the TWI.

Initial Investigations

Cardiac catheterization is both the definitive diagnostic investigation and guides therapeutic intervention in CS complicating acute MI. Cardiac catheterization is typically preceded by several initial investigations and non‐interventional management strategies. However, CS is a clinical diagnosis and no investigation should delay emergent cardiac catheterization.

ECG

The ECG should be ordered within 10 minutes of presentation. 22, 23 ECG findings in ACS are divided into 3 groups: ST‐segment elevation, ST‐segment depression, and non–ST‐segment deviation. 24 Early ECG changes of early coronary occlusion and transmural infarction includes hyperacute T waves, which tend to be short‐lived and progress rapidly to ST‐segment elevation. 25 The presence of ST‐segment elevation in ≥ 2 contiguous leads is an indication for urgent reperfusion. 23 Transient ST‐segment elevation, ST‐segment depression, and/or T‐wave inversions should raise clinical suspicion of ACS. These patients should be treated with aggressive medical therapy and be evaluated immediately for early coronary angiography. 23 New guidelines suggest that left bundle branch block (LBBB) is no longer an indication for urgent catheterization. 26 In the appropriate clinical context and in the presence of suggestive diagnostic evidence, urgent catheterization should still be considered. Pathologic Q waves are a reflection of total size of MI, rather than transmural extent, and their presence predicts a lower ejection fraction (EF) and a larger MI. 27 In the absence of previously described changes and high clinical suspicion of ACS, true posterior wall myocardial infarction is suggested by the following: ST‐segment depressions in the septal and anterior precordial leads (V1–V4), an R:S wave ratio > 1 in V1‐V2, ST‐segment elevations in the posterior leads of a poster ECG (V7–V9). 28 If there is co‐existing inferior wall myocardial infarction, there will be ST‐segment elevations in the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF). A normal ECG is not necessarily reassuring as posterior and lateral walls are not fully represented on ECG and thus may not exclude ischemia. 23 STEs confer a higher mortality risk in ACS complicated by CS. It has been suggested that patients have a similar 90‐day prognosis if effective revascularization takes place, regardless of ST segment patterns. 24 Other findings on (Figure 2) that are suggestive of ACS include sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, atrial fibrillation, new bundle branch block, or worsening of a symptomatic high‐degree atrioventricular block. 29

### Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in pregnancy: a case report and literature review [^115eFWj3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) is a rare life-threatening illness that can affect pregnant women. It should be considered a cardiac emergency as it mimics myocardial infarction, peripartum cardiomyopathy, acute myocarditis, and dilated cardiomyopathy and is a diagnosis of exclusion. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) typically presents with acute retrosternal chest pain, palpitations and diaphoresis. Affected patients may also have symptoms of left heart failure such as paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea and dyspnea.

The common triggers of TCM include psychosocial stressors with greater occurrence in those with premorbid psychiatric illnesses. Our patient had a history of depressive illness due to a previous adverse pregnancy outcome which may have predisposed her to TCM. In addition, it is possible that the severe preeclampsia caused an acute elevation of blood pressure from the baseline triggering TCM. Increased afterload from hypertension may cause a demand-supply mismatch leading to a type 2 non- ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Diagnostic evaluation of TCM includes an electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac biomarkers, echocardiography and left heart angiography. The ECG abnormalities commonly encountered include ST segment elevation in the anterior and precordial leads with some having ST segment depression. A few patients may have QT interval prolongation, T wave inversion, abnormal Q waves and non-specific abnormalities. The majority of patients will have elevated cardiac troponin levels with normal to mildly elevated creatinine kinase. The natriuretic peptides (brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and pro-BNP) may be elevated in up to 83% of cases indicating ventricular strain, though to a lesser extent than that seen in acute myocarditis.

The typical findings on transthoracic echocardiography include a large area of regional wall motion akinesia of the LV extending beyond the territory of a single coronary artery. There is apical ballooning of the LV with normal basal contractility. The LV ejection fraction is often reduced ranging from 20 to 49%. In addition, there may be mitral regurgitation with or without a systolic anterior motion of the anterior leaflet.

### V1-V2-V3-V4 T wave inversion: left or right ventricle? [^111Ttrfv]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

An 84-year-old woman, affected by Alzheimer's disease, presented to the emergency department with intense dyspnoea. Since ECG was showing T wave inversion in anterior leads and troponin-T was high, the patient was admitted to our unit with a diagnosis of anterior non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. However, the patient's medical history and a further review of the ECG led us to suspect a pulmonary embolism (PE) as a possible differential clinical diagnosis. We tested this alternative hypothesis: echocardiography as well as contrast-enhanced CT scan confirmed the diagnosis of PE. We describe these misleading ECG findings together with a brief discussion of electrocardiographical changes in pulmonary embolism.

Methods

Study Design and Setting

This was a planned substudy of the Diagnosis of Occlusion MI and Reperfusion by Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram in Acute Thrombotic Occlusion database, which is a 2‐site collaboration designed to study ECG findings in OMI. Stony Brook University Hospital is a suburban, academic hospital and a regional cardiac catheterization referral center. Hennepin Healthcare Medical Center is an urban academic hospital with a cardiac catheterization laboratory. Both emergency departments (EDs) have > 100 000 visits per year. Institutional review board approval was obtained at both sites, and there was no extramural funding. Informed consent was waived by both institutional review boards for this retrospective study.

Selection of Participants

First, each site accessed the cardiac catheterization laboratory activation database (all urgent and emergent left heart catheterizations during 1 year), which provided both cases (OMI) and controls (without OMI). At Stony Brook University Hospital, we added a previously collected prospective cohort of ED patients who were admitted to the cardiology service with suspected ACS during a 6‐month time period (again contributing both cases and controls). To ensure that the final cohort also contains a substantial number of control patients with abnormal ECGs, we added additional controls from Hennepin Healthcare Medical Center by searching the Use of TROPonin In Acute coronary syndromes (UTROPIA) databasefor patients without OMI but with STE, STD, or T‐wave inversion, one‐third of whom had adjudicated nonocclusion MI. Patients were excluded if there were no ECGs in the electronic medical record or if there was insufficient retrospective information available to determine the primary outcome (the presence or absence of our OMI definition).

Electrocardiogram (ECG) — De Winter sign consists of tall, prominent, symmetrical T waves arising from upsloping ST-segment depression > 1 mm at the J-point in the precordial leads, with 0.5–1 mm ST-segment elevation that may be seen in lead aVR; de Winter's sign can be seen in proximal left anterior descending artery occlusion and therefore warrants immediate angiography.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^115tqYdH]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Prior myocardial infarction — Q wave features that increase specificity and supportive imaging evidence. The specificity of the ECG diagnosis for MI is greatest when Q waves occur in several leads or lead groupings, or are > 0.04 s, and when associated with ST deviations or T wave changes; for example, minor Q waves ≥ 0.02 s and < 0.03 s that are ≥ 1 mm deep are suggestive of prior MI if accompanied by inverted T waves in the same lead group. In the absence of nonischemic causes, echocardiography, myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET), or magnetic resonance imaging that show regional myocardial thinning, scar or reduced wall motion provide strong evidence for prior MI, particularly when ECG criteria are equivocal.

### The prominent T wave: electrocardiographic differential diagnosis [^1125gvi4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The prominent T wave is an abnormal T-wave morphology encountered in the earliest phase of ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Prominent T waves, however, are associated with other diagnoses, including hyperkalemia, early repolarization, and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). This article focuses on the electrocardiographic differential diagnosis of the prominent T wave with the presentation of 4 illustrative cases. We also recommend that the designation hyperacute should refer exclusively to the prominent T waves of ST-segment elevation AMI.

### ST-segment depression on the initial electrocardiogram in acute myocardial infarction-prognostic significance and its effect on short-term mortality: a report from the national registry of myocardial infarction (NRMI-2, 3, 4) [^1115oakL]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

This study analyzed 255,256 patients who had acute myocardial infarction and were enrolled in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction 2, 3, and 4 (1994 to 2002). The objective was to determine in-hospital mortality rate among patients who had ST-segment depression on the initial electrocardiogram. Patients who had ST-segment depression had an in-hospital mortality rate (15.8%) similar to that of patients who had ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block (15.5%). After adjusting for observed differences, ST-segment depression was associated with only a slightly lower odds ratio (0.91) of mortality compared with ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block.

### Characteristics of presenting electrocardiograms of acute myocardial infarction from a community-based population predict short-and long-term mortality [^114vfUBs]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

To investigate the relevance of presenting electrocardiographic (ECG) patterns to short- and long-term mortality in nonreferral patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 6 ECG patterns were analyzed. A consecutive series of 907 patients from Olmsted County, Minnesota, admitted to the Mayo Clinic Cardiac Care Unit from January 1, 1988 to March 31, 1998 for acute myocardial infarction comprised the study population. ECG patterns and distribution in the population were: (1) ST elevation alone (20.8%), (2) ST elevation with ST depression (35.2%), (3) normal or nondiagnostic electrocardiograms (18.5%), (4) ST depression alone (11.8%), (5) T-wave inversion only (10.7%), and (6) new left bundle branch block (LBBB) (3.0%). Seven- and 28-day mortalities varied significantly (p < 0.01) among the 6 ECG groups. Respective mortalities were 3.0% and 6.0% for patients with normal or nondiagnostic electrocardiograms, 3.1% and 5.2% for T-wave inversion only, 7.4% and 10.6% for ST elevation alone, 9.4% and 13.1% for ST depression alone, 10.3% and 13.8% for ST elevation with ST depression, and 18.5% and 22.2% for new LBBB. Length of hospital stay (LOS) also varied among the ECG pattern groups (p < 0.001) with the longest average LOS being in the new LBBB group (12.5 days). Long-term survival was similar among 5 ECG pattern groups (45% to 55% at 8 years from discharge) with the exception of LBBB (20% at 8 years). Among non-LBBB groups, ST-segment depression with or without ST elevation was associated with increased short-term mortality. Also, in this community-based population, 18.5% of patients had normal or nondiagnostic electrocardiograms.

### A subtle ECG… [^112MNKKK]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Question. Discussion The answer is A: hypokalemia. Although subtle, this electrocardiogram demonstrates a flattening of the T waves with development of U waves. associated with hypokalemia. The ECG patterns seen in patients with hypokalemia range from slight T-wave flattening alone to the appearance of prominent U waves, occasionally with ST depressions or T-wave inversions. This is usually a progressive pattern. When the U wave is greater than the T wave, the potassium level is usually less than 2. 7 mEq per L. The most common causes of hypokalemia are medications or renal loss related to metabolic alkalosis or potassium loss in the stool secondary to diarrhea.

1 Hypokalemia, although tolerated well in most patients, can be life-threatening in those with underlying cardiac disease. The potassium level in this patient was 2. 3 mEq per L. Treatment includes potassium replacement and correction of the underlying cause when possible. Some patients require daily potassium supplementation. Interestingly, the hypokalemia occurring in this patient was a result of Bartter's syndrome, a rare hereditary disorder of renal potassium wasting secondary to impaired electrolyte transport in the ascending loop of Henle. 2 It is treated mainly by liberal potassium supplementation. The use of spironolactone can also help prevent potassium wasting. As for the remaining multiple-choice answers, hypocalcemia manifests itself on ECG as a prolonged QT interval, which is not present in this tracing. There are no ST elevations or other changes suggestive of acute myocardial infarction in this tracing.

First-degree atrioventricular block should also be ruled out because the PR interval on the ECG shown here is less than 0. 20 mm. Finally, Wollf-Parkinson-White syndrome is a preexcitation syndrome characterized on ECG by wide QRS complexes, short PR intervals and delta waves, none of which are present on the ECG shown here.

- Exercise ECG is widely used for the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease. The most common ECG sign of myocardial ischemia is flat or down-sloping ST-segment depression of 1. 0 mm or greater. This report draws attention to other much less common, but possibly equally important, ECG manifestations of myocardial ischemia. Serial ECGs obtained during the treadmill stress test of a 40-year-old man with angiographically proven coronary artery disease exhibited virtually all known ECG signs of ischemia, namely, ST-segment depression, ST-segment elevation and alternans, intraventricular conduction abnormalities, and U-wave inversion.

### An anterior STEMI equivalent-reply… [^113pp9pj]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

In Reply We thank Drs Rubin and Montana for their comments on our Challenges in Clinical Electrocardiography. 1 They assert that the ST-segment depression in V2 is unlikely to be a reciprocal change to inferior wall ST-segment elevation, and more likely to represent an evolving de Winter pattern of hyperacute T waves in acute anterior myocardial infarction. While we somewhat agree with the authors, in the original description of de Winter pattern the ST-segment showed a 1- to 3-mm upsloping ST-segment depression at the J point in all precordial leads V1 to V6 with tall positive and symmetrical T waves. 2 The electrocardiogram in question showed ST-segment elevation in lead V1 and hyperacute T waves in V2 to V6 with ST-segment depression in V2. Isolated ST-segment depression in V2 is not common with the de Winter pattern. We hypothesized that this isolated ST-segment depression in V2 could be owing to sparing of the diagonal artery.

In high lateral infarcts related to the diagonal artery, the ST-segment vector points toward the axilla and is usually directed from 0° to −90° in the frontal plane, which is represented by leads I and aVL. As lead V2 is to the left and higher than the center of the heart, the frontal plane projection of lead V2 also points toward the axilla. 3 Therefore, the structure of the complexes in V2 frequently resemble the form in lead aVL. Thus, lead V2 also may show reciprocal changes in cases with ST-segment elevation in inferior leads. In the presence of hyperacute T waves, it is difficult to ascertain whether the form of ST-segment depression is typical of reciprocal change. We agree with Rubin and Montana that if the serial electrocardiograms had been obtained before the percutaneous coronary intervention, a classic de Winter pattern or a full-blown anterior STEMI pattern may have become evident.
