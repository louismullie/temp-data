## Question

ESR less than 1

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) result of less than 1 mm/hr and what clinical actions to take next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this value is physiologically plausible and what the normal reference ranges are. Then, I should verify potential technical or pre-analytical errors that could artifactually depress ESR. Next, I will consider rare clinical contexts where an extremely low ESR might be meaningful. After that, I should review the test's limitations and whether CRP would be more informative. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, context-driven plan for follow-up and documentation, including when to repeat testing or escalate evaluation [^117HUBvm] [^114wu1HY].

> Let me first confirm the value itself. An ESR less than 1 mm/hr is physiologically possible but extremely low, well below typical adult reference ranges of about 0–15 mm/hr for men and 0–20 mm/hr for women, and far below disease-specific thresholds used in guidelines such as 30 mm/hr for prosthetic joint infection screening or 50 mm/hr in giant cell arteritis criteria, so this result sits at the extreme low end of normal and is not inherently pathologic [^115GBasg] [^1159TF3b] [^115DAeHg].

> Wait, let me verify potential technical or pre-analytical issues before drawing any clinical conclusion. ESR is sensitive to tube orientation, vibration, temperature, and timing from specimen collection; improper Westergren technique, short read times, or nonstandard methods can artifactually lower results, and using fresh blood for quality control is recommended to ensure reliability, so I should double-check the lab method and specimen handling if this result is unexpected or discordant with the clinical picture [^117HUBvm] [^114LRjB9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about inflammation just because the ESR is very low. ESR is a nonspecific, indirect marker influenced by fibrinogen, globulins, red cell morphology, anemia, renal function, and age; Choosing Wisely and stewardship literature emphasize that CRP is preferred for detecting acute-phase inflammation in undifferentiated patients because it is more specific and less confounded, so a very low ESR does not by itself exclude disease and should be interpreted in clinical context alongside CRP and the bedside assessment [^114wu1HY] [^114c3ror] [^115VVzjw].

> I need to check whether an ESR this low could reflect a true physiologic state rather than error. In population data, a substantial proportion of healthy individuals have ESR values in the 0–3 mm/hr range, supporting that values near zero can be entirely normal; additionally, in the absence of inflammation, ESR is determined largely by plasma proteins and red cell factors such as fibrinogen, globulin, hemoglobin, and triglycerides, so a very low ESR may simply reflect low inflammatory burden and favorable protein profiles rather than pathology [^115DAeHg] [^115BmcFi].

> But wait, what if the clinical context suggests an inflammatory process and the ESR is paradoxically low. Rarely, extreme hypofibrinogenemia, polycythemia, or markedly abnormal red cell morphology can blunt ESR, and in certain vasculitides or infections, discordance between ESR and CRP has been described; in such cases, I should confirm with CRP, review a smear for red cell morphology, and consider repeating ESR with attention to pre-analytical variables if the result conflicts with the clinical picture [^115VVzjw] [^117HUBvm].

> Next, I should review disease-specific thresholds to ensure I am not missing a condition where even a low ESR could be informative. For example, in suspected prosthetic joint infection, recommended screening thresholds are ESR greater than 30 mm/hr and CRP greater than 10 mg/L, and in giant cell arteritis, an ESR of at least 50 mm/hr is one of the ACR criteria; thus, an ESR less than 1 mm/hr makes these diagnoses substantially less likely but does not absolutely exclude them, reinforcing that normal inflammatory markers do not rule out infection or inflammation when pretest probability is high [^115GBasg] [^1159TF3b].

> I will now examine how to proceed clinically. If the patient has no inflammatory symptoms or signs, a very low ESR is reassuring and requires no further action beyond documentation; if there are concerning features, I should order CRP to better assess acute-phase inflammation, repeat ESR if there is any doubt about specimen integrity, and correlate with the history, examination, and targeted imaging or specialty referral as indicated by the pretest probability and evolving findings [^114wu1HY] [^114c3ror].

> Let me reconsider the role of combined testing. Although some orthopedic literature supports the combined use of ESR and CRP to increase diagnostic performance in specific contexts such as prosthetic joint infection, simultaneous ordering of ESR and CRP in undifferentiated patients is often low yield and increases costs; therefore, I should avoid reflex dual ordering and instead tailor testing to the clinical question and local guideline thresholds [^113Z6pYH] [^116LpFSv] [^114wu1HY].

> In summary, an ESR less than 1 mm/hr is an uncommon but generally benign finding that most often reflects excellent technique and low inflammatory activity; I should confirm there is no technical error, avoid overinterpreting the isolated value, and use CRP and clinical judgment to guide next steps, escalating only if the clinical picture demands it despite normal markers [^115DAeHg] [^114wu1HY] [^115VVzjw].

---

An ESR less than 1 mm/hr is **physiologically possible** but extremely rare, typically reflecting **technical error** or **low plasma protein states** (hypofibrinogenemia, hypogammaglobulinemia, polycythemia, or marked leukocytosis) [^117HUBvm] [^115BmcFi]. It is not associated with specific diseases and should prompt **verification of the test method**, review of hematologic parameters, and correlation with clinical context. If confirmed, no treatment is indicated; if due to low protein states, manage the underlying cause.

---

## Physiological basis of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)

ESR measures the rate at which red blood cells settle in a vertical column over one hour, driven by rouleaux formation from acute-phase proteins (fibrinogen, immunoglobulins) [^1162dqbT]. Normal ESR reflects a balance between pro- and anti-rouleaux factors; **very low ESR** implies minimal rouleaux-promoting proteins or altered RBC properties [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance of extremely low ESR values

An ESR less than 1 mm/hr is **exceedingly rare** and not linked to specific diseases. It may reflect:

- **Technical error**: Improper tube orientation, vibration, temperature, or timing can artifactually lower ESR [^117HUBvm].
- **Low plasma protein states**: Hypofibrinogenemia, hypogammaglobulinemia, or marked leukocytosis can reduce rouleaux and ESR [^117HUBvm].
- **Altered RBC properties**: Polycythemia or spherocytosis can impair sedimentation [^117HUBvm].

---

## Conditions associated with extremely low ESR values

Although no disease specifically causes ESR < 1 mm/hr, **associated conditions** include:

| **Condition** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|
| Hypofibrinogenemia | Reduced rouleaux formation |
| Hypogammaglobulinemia | Reduced immunoglobulins |
| Polycythemia vera | Increased RBC mass impeding sedimentation |
| Marked leukocytosis | Increased blood viscosity |
| Technical errors | Improper test execution |

---

## Clinical implications and management

An ESR less than 1 mm/hr has **no direct clinical implications**; management focuses on:

- **Verification**: Repeat ESR using standardized methods (Westergren) [^114LRjB9].
- **Clinical correlation**: Assess for conditions causing low plasma proteins or altered RBCs.
- **No treatment**: No intervention is indicated for an isolated extremely low ESR.

---

## Limitations and considerations

ESR is nonspecific and influenced by multiple factors; **extremely low values** are more often due to technical issues or low protein states than disease. Interpretation should always consider **clinical context** and concurrent laboratory findings [^114wu1HY].

---

An ESR less than 1 mm/hr is **rare and usually reflects technical error or low plasma protein states**; it is not disease-specific. Confirm the result, evaluate for underlying causes if persistent, and manage accordingly.

### Why shouldn' T we determine the erythrocyte sedimentation rate? [^115DPZX9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

A test that is meant to measure a given parameter is more likely to detect changes in that parameter if it is not affected by factors other than those which it is intended to quantitate. The clinical use of the laboratory test for determining the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is backed by nearly a century of experience. Although its nonspecificity is acknowledged, it has been used to quantitate the inflammatory process that underlies infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic disorders. I believe that this venerable test is affected by too many factors in addition to that which we think we are measuring, to the point that its clinical usefulness is severely compromised.

IWGDF/IDSA — Inflammatory biomarkers for suspected diabetes-related foot osteomyelitis (DFO): a 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis found that procalcitonin (PCT) had the highest diagnostic test accuracy with sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 0.85, 0.67 and 0.844 at a cut-off value of 0.33 ng/mL; a large single-centre study reported that ESR > 60 mm/hr plus CRP ≥ 80 mg/L had a high positive predictive value but a modest negative predictive value for DFO; another study showed that elevated ESR (> 43 mm/h) with a positive probe-to-bone (PTB) test had a high correlation with positive bone culture and/or histology; overall, neither plain x-ray, inflammatory biomarkers nor probe-to-bone tests can solely and reliably rule in or rule out DFO, and when diagnostic doubt persists after the clinical assessment and review of plain X-rays of the foot, we recommend testing for ESR, CRP, or PCT, noting that this recommendation is conditional and based on low-quality and inconsistent diagnostic accuracy evidence.

### What are the optimal cutoff values for ESR and CRP to diagnose osteomyelitis in patients with diabetes-related foot infections? [^1167ktyN]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Distinguishing osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infection of the foot is important because osteomyelitis is associated with more operations, amputation, and prolonged antibiotic exposure. Both erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are routinely ordered inflammatory biomarkers for evaluating foot infection. When initial evaluation is inconclusive, advanced imaging is indicated, and high clinical or radiographic suspicion of osteomyelitis may indicate bone biopsy to identify organisms and antibiotic sensitivity. Although ESR and CRP levels are helpful for distinguishing osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infections in patients with diabetes-related foot infections, parameters regarding optimal cutoff values for those tests have not, to our knowledge, been defined.

Questions/Purposes

(1) What are the optimal cutoff values for ESR and CRP to differentiate osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infection in patients with diabetes-related foot infection? (2) Can a diagnostic algorithm be derived to guide interpretation of ESR and CRP to improve recognition of osteomyelitis in the setting of diabetic foot infection?

Methods

The medical records of 1842 patients between 18 and 89 years of age treated at our institution between January 1, 2010 and February 6, 2017 for foot infection were reviewed. For inclusion, patients must have had a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, moderate or severe infection, ESR and CRP values within 72 hours of admission, either advanced imaging (MRI or single-positron emission computed tomography/computed tomography [SPECT/CT]) or bone biopsy during admission and must not have had comorbidities that could affect ESR and CRP, such as autoimmune disorders. As such, 1489 patients were excluded, and 353 patients were included in the study. Osteomyelitis was diagnosed by positive bone culture or histopathology. Osteomyelitis was considered to be absent if there was a negative MRI or SPECT/CT result, or negative bone culture and histology findings if imaging was inconclusive. We identified 176 patients with osteomyelitis and 177 with soft-tissue infection. A blinded investigator performed the statistics. Optimal cutoffs of ESR and CRP were determined using receiver operative characteristic (ROC) analysis. A diagnostic algorithm was determined using epidemiologic principles of screening evaluations.

Results

An ESR of 60 mm/h and a CRP level of 7.9 mg/dL were determined to be the optimal cutoff points for predicting osteomyelitis based on results of the ROC analysis. The ESR threshold of 60 mm/h demonstrated a sensitivity of 74% (95% confidence interval, 67–80) and specificity of 56% (95% CI, 48–63) for osteomyelitis, whereas the CRP threshold of 7.9 mg/dL had a sensitivity of 49% (95% CI, 41–57) and specificity of 80% (95% CI, 74–86). If the ESR is < 30 mm/h, the likelihood of osteomyelitis is low. However, if ESR is > 60 mm/h and CRP level is > 7.9 mg/dL, the likelihood of osteomyelitis is high, and treatment of suspected osteomyelitis should be strongly considered.

Conclusions

While ESR is better for ruling out osteomyelitis initially, CRP helps distinguish osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infection in patients with high ESR values. Further prospective studies addressing the prognostic value of ESR and CRP are needed, and a more comprehensive diagnostic algorithm should be developed to include other diagnostic tests such as probe-to-bone and imaging.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) — diagnostic role and limitations in pediatric ABA: Blood markers of systemic inflammation, such as CRP, can aid in distinguishing ABA (particularly caused by S. aureus) from transient nonbacterial synovitis, though the serum CRP is usually, but not always, elevated at presentation. CRP alone, or when used with clinical history and examination, has insufficient specificity or sensitivity to confirm or rule-out ABA; however, obtaining a CRP at presentation is useful because, if elevated, it can be used to monitor appropriate response to management. A systematic review identified three prospective cohort studies and one retrospective case-control study assessing CRP diagnostic test accuracy in children with symptoms suspicious for musculoskeletal infections (2005 to 2022), which suggested very limited value for CRP as a confirmatory diagnostic test, with numeric cut-off levels varying and none establishing a definitive CRP value above which ABA should be suspected or below which it could be excluded. A recent prospective study reported an a posteriori optimal cut-off of 23.8 mg/L (2.38 md/dL) that has not been validated; another prospective cohort evaluated two CRP cut-offs, 100 and 500 mg/L (10 and 50 mg/dL); a third required abnormal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or CRP (> 10 mm/hr and > 100 mg/L respectively), and no evaluation of the children without elevated markers was reported.

### Is treatment in patients with suspected nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis effective? Six-month results of a placebo-controlled trial [^114XxQEj]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical efficacy

At week 16, 10 of 72 patients (13.9%) had achieved an ASAS20 response: 6 (16.7%) in the ETN group and 4 (11.1%) in the placebo group. This difference was not statistically significant (RR 0.7 [95% CI 0.2–2.2], P = 0.5) (Table 4). ASAS40 response at 16 weeks was achieved in 6 of 72 patients (8.3%): 3 (8.3%) in each treatment group. An ASDAS‐CRP response (clinically important improvement and major improvement) was achieved in 12 of 62 patients (19.4%): 8 (25.0%) in the ETN group and 4 (13.3%) in the placebo group. This difference was also not statistically significant (RR 0.5 [95% CI 0.2–1.6], P = 0.2) (Table 4). Separate assessments of clinically important improvement and major improvement showed no significant differences between the 2 treatments at 16 weeks (RR 0.3 [95% CI 0.1–1.4], P = 0.1 and RR 2.1 [95% CI 0.2–22], P = 0.5, respectively) (Table 4). Low disease activity according to the ASDAS‐CRP at 16 weeks was achieved in 30 of 70 patients (42.9%): 44.1% in the ETN group and 41.7% in the placebo group (RR:0.9 [95% CI 0.6–1.6], P = 0.8). Inactive disease according to the ASDAS‐CRP was achieved in 13 of 70 patients (18.6%): 20.6% in the ETN group and 16.7% in the placebo group (RR 0.8 [95% CI 0.3–2.2], P = 0.7). During the first 16 weeks, both the ESR and the pain score showed more improvement in the ETN group than in the placebo group (mean ± SD change −2.2 ± 5.2 mm/hour versus −1.4 ± 7.4 mm/hour and −1.4 ± 2.7 versus −0.8 ± 2.7, respectively).

### Very late relapses in Hodgkin lymphoma treated with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy: linear pattern and distinct prognostic factors [^1133egFM]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The present study provided novel observations in an attempt to shed light on some of the questions raised above, which remained unanswered even after the large GHSG study.

First, we demonstrated that the linear pattern of VLRs continues beyond 20 years up to 25–30 years. Interestingly, we recorded the latest VLR at 35.1 years and recorded 8 cases beyond the 20th year.

Second, patients who did not receive RT were more likely to experience VLRs. If this is validated, it may impact the long-term results of recent randomized trials, which are awaited with great interest, because non-inferiority of CT vs. CMT may be affected.

Third, elevated ESR ≥ 50 mm/h was associated with lower VLR risk despite the marginally positive association of its strong correlates (stage and B-symptoms) with VLRs (HR ~1.2–1.5). Elevated ESR denotes biologically active, more aggressive disease, which may have a different biology related to PR/ER but also with some kind of long-term plateau and lower risk of VLR. Thus, some patients with advanced disease, probably those with delayed diagnosis and less inflammatory background reflected by lower ESR, may be more prone to the development of VLR. This hypothesis is supported by the progressively decreasing percentage of ESR ≥ 50 mm/h in patients with PR/ER, LR and VLR (Supplementary Table 1).

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2021 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in pediatrics [^111mbJEs]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis — Historically, case series have described ESR elevation in 90% to 100% of children with AHO, but rates as low as 70% to 87% also have been reported, and ESR combined with CRP may slightly improve sensitivity and negative predictive value for the diagnosis of AHO, but specific thresholds and the overall clinical utility of using both CRP and ESR for diagnostic purposes remain uncertain. The ESR tends to rise more slowly than CRP in acute infection and to decrease more slowly than CRP in an appropriately treated infection; the ESR is no longer used routinely to diagnose AHO in children.

### Discordance between erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein measurements: clinical significance [^115VVzjw]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are common measures of systemic inflammation. Our goal was to identify clinical factors associated with CRP/ESR discordance.

Methods

We identified patients with ESR and CRP results at our academic hospital over six months. We matched individuals with discordant results (one measure in highest tertile, other in lowest), by age and sex to those with non-discordant results, and reviewed medical records for laboratory and clinical factors. We employed analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Chi squared tests to compare these variables in discordant and non-discordant subjects. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate the relative risk of CRP/ESR discordance associated with each variable.

Results

2,069 patients had CRP and ESR measured on the same day; 87 had discordant results, 55 (2.6%) with elevated ESR/low CRP, 32 (1.5%) with elevated CRP/ low ESR. Underlying infection was associated with > 14 fold risk of elevated ESR/low CRP discordance (p < 0.001). Renal insufficiency was associated with increased risk of elevated ESR/low CRP discordance, (p = 0.003). RA patients were slightly less likely to have elevated ESR/low CRP, (p = 0.008, NS after Bonferroni correction). Low serum albumin was associated with both kinds discordance.

Conclusion

Infection, renal insufficiency, and low albumin were associated with having elevated ESR/low CRP; low albumin predicted elevated CRP/low ESR and elevated ESR/low CRP discordance. RA patients were less likely to have elevated ESR/depressed CRP. ESR as a measure inflammation in systemic rheumatic disease may be limited in settings of infection, renal insufficiency, and low albumin.

### Erythrocyte sedimentation rate in patients with renal insufficiency and renal replacement therapy [^112WcD6r]. Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Determination of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a simple diagnostic tool for estimating systemic inflammation. It remains unclear whether ESR is influenced by renal disease or renal replacement therapy (RRT).

Objective

To report the incidence and extent of ESR elevations in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the possible impact of RRT.

Methods

We performed a single-center, retrospective study in inpatients with or without renal disease and in those with RRT, comparing ESR levels and other laboratory and clinical information.

Results

A total of 203 patients were included. On average, ESR was elevated (mean [SD], 51.7 [34.6] mm/h), with no statistically significant difference between the patient groups. Only those receiving PD showed significantly higher ESR (78.3 [33.1] mm/h; P < .001).

Conclusions

ESR testing can be used without restriction in patients with CKD and in patients undergoing hemodialysis and who have received kidney transplantation; however, this measurement should be monitored carefully in patients with PD.

### ESR guidelines for the communication of urgent and unexpected findings [^114ifuqd]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

The timely communication of radiological findings is important for patient care. When imaging reveals abnormalities that require urgent action, or shows significant unexpected findings, the usual methods of communication may not be reliable enough to ensure that those responsible for clinical care of the patient act promptly. These guidelines suggest methods for improving communication in these circumstances, using clear protocols and procedures agreed between imaging units and referrers. Main Messages
- Communicating critical radiological findings will enable urgent or appropriate action to be taken.
- Good communication helps to improve patient safety.
- Clear departmental protocols become familiar to referrers within the organisation.
- Referrers should be aware of their responsibility to read and act on radiological reports.

### Erythrocyte sedimentation rate as an independent prognostic marker for mortality: a prospective population-based cohort study [^116PhyV8]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A very high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is usually an indication of underlying pathology. Additionally, a moderately elevated ESR may also be attributable to biological ageing. Whether the ESR is a prognostic factor for mortality, regardless of age, has been scarcely investigated. Therefore, the objective was to analyse the association between elevated ESR levels and the risk of mortality in a prospective cohort of the general population.

Methods

We studied data from the Rotterdam Study (1990–2014). ESR levels were measured at baseline and individuals were followed until death or end of study. Associations between moderately (20–50 mm h -1) and markedly (> 50 mm h -1) elevated ESR levels and all-cause mortality were assessed using multivariate Cox proportional hazard models.

Results

In total, 5226 participants were included, and the mean age was 70.3 years. During a median follow-up time of 14.9 years, 3749 participants died (71.7%). After adjustment, both a moderately elevated ESR and a markedly elevated ESR were associated with a significantly higher risk of overall mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12–1.35 and HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.38–2.60, respectively]. Although the ESR becomes higher with age, in a group aged above 75 years, without any comorbidities, an ESR > 20 mm h -1 remained associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality (HR 1.29, 95%CI 1.01–1.64).

Conclusion

An elevated ESR is an independent prognostic factor for mortality. Despite the fact that ESR increases with age, it remains associated with an increased risk of mortality and warrants close follow-up.

### Consensus document for the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infections: a joint paper by the EANM, EBJIS, and ESR (with ESCMID endorsement) [^115GBasg]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

3. CRP and ESR should always be performed in patients with suspected prosthetic joint infection. A normal value does not rule out PJI.

Level of evidence: 2.

Patients presenting with clinical signs of prosthetic joint infection (i.e. fever, unexplained pain at the site of arthroplasty, prosthetic loosening, or a sinus tract) should be subjected to screening for inflammatory markers in serum. C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are good preliminary tests. Screening of these markers can be performed rapidly, inexpensively, and with minimal inconvenience. Although there is considerable variation in sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) for both CRP (SE 21–100%, SP 20–96%) and ESR (SE 58–97%, SP 33–90.9%), in general they show good diagnostic value, and are of relevance particularly for therapy follow-up. A threshold of 10 mg/l for CRP and 30 mm/h for ESR of is recommended for diagnostic purposes. One level 1 study and 32 level 2 studies addressed the diagnostic efficacy of CRP and ESR in serum. However, when testing for CRP and ESR, one should keep in mind that both markers can be influenced by numerous factors (i.e. neoplastic and inflammatory conditions, age, and technical details). Furthermore, CRP is produced in the liver, and especially in low-grade chronic PJI, levels may not be elevated. Therefore, a careful history and physical examination are mandatory. Several studies suggest using the combination of ESR and CRP. In any case, if one of these markers is above the threshold, further diagnostic tests should be performed. Low CRP and ESR do not rule out PJI.

### Diagnosis and prevention of periprosthetic joint infections [^113Z6pYH]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). High credibility.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) — if both ESR and CRP were negative, the combined tests were strong at ruling out PJI (negative LR = 0 to .06), and if both were positive they were useful for ruling in PJI (positive LR range = 4.34 to 13.5). There is concern that ESR and CRP may be elevated in the early postoperative period, and three included studies evaluated these biomarkers for PJI in the early postoperative period. In hip and knee patients within 3 months of surgery, CRP (13.5mg/L) was reported as a weak test (positive LR = 3.52; negative LR = 0.24). Another moderate quality study in hip and knee patients showed CRP (23.5mg/L) to be a strong rule in test (positive LR = 14.5) and a moderately good rule out test (negative LR = .14) within 4 weeks of surgery; in the same study ESR (54.5 mm/hr) was a strong rule in test (positive LR = 11.4) but a weak rule out test (Negative LR = .21) for early PJI. A low-quality study of hip patients found ESR (44 mm/hr) was a moderately good rule out test within six weeks of surgery but was poor for ruling in PJI (positive LR = 1.96; negative LR = .15), and in the same study CRP was a strong rule in test (positive LR = 66.76).

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2021 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in pediatrics [^111h7pTh]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) monitoring in pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) are characterized by postoperative CRP rises "on the order of 3 to 15 mg/dL (30 to 150 mg/L)" peaking "on the second to third postoperative day", while "The ESR peaks similarly to CRP but normalizes more slowly" and, in uncomplicated cases, "usually occurs within 3 to 4 weeks". Within these limits, "the panel suggests sequential monitoring of CRP as an adjunctive measure" and notes "There are no data to support a particular frequency of CRP monitoring", but "Measurement every 2 to 3 days during the early therapeutic course, rather than daily, followed by weekly or other periodic measurement until normalization (or a clear trend toward normal is evident) is an acceptable approach". The guideline cautions that "The interpretation of persistent elevation of the CRP in the face of apparent clinical improvement is uncertain" and that "no specific thresholds of CRP concentration have been well validated for specific clinical interventions or decisions regarding the duration of therapy".

### Which measure of inflammation to use? A comparison of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein measurements from randomized clinical trials of golimumab in rheumatoid arthritis [^113V3Ya6]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess clinical utility of measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP) versus Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in evaluating patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods

Data from 3 randomized clinical trials of golimumab involving 1247 patients with RA in which ESR and CRP were obtained at baseline and Week 24, along with standard measures of clinical disease activity [swollen and tender joint counts, global disease activity assessment, composite Disease Activity Scores (DAS) and Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI)], were utilized. Result. Both ESR and CRP were significant predictors of swollen joint count (p < 0.001 for each). Only 4.5% of patients with no swollen joints had elevated CRP and normal ESR, but 15.2% had elevated ESR and normal CRP. ESR and CRP correlated significantly (Pearson r = 0.59, p < 0.001) with each other. DAS-ESR and DAS-CRP were highly correlated (r = 0.96, p < 0.001) with each other, although DAS-ESR values were slightly lower than the DAS-CRP values at the upper end of the range (DAS > 8). Both ESR and CRP were significantly associated with CDAI (p < 0.001 for each).

Conclusion

It is not necessary to obtain both ESR and CRP measures for clinical disease activity assessment in clinical trials of RA. Neither test adds significantly to clinical measures of disease activity including joint counts and global assessments. Where available, the CRP alone may be preferred for disease activity assessment as a simple, validated, reproducible, non age-dependent test.

### How to use the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in paediatrics [^117HUBvm]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2015). Low credibility.

The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) has become a ubiquitously used technique in medicine as a marker of systemic illness. The test involves placing anticoagulated whole blood into an upright test tube and monitoring the rate at which red blood cells (RBC) fall over time. Negative charges keep RBC from sticking together. If this charge is neutralised, RBC stack into chains, or rouleaux, and fall more rapidly. ESR can be measured with a variety of tests: Westergren and modified Westergren; Wintrobe; micro-ESR. The Westergren is the most commonly used method of performing the ESR. Technical factors, such as temperature, time from specimen collection, tube orientation and vibration, can affect the results. RBC size, shape and concentration impact the ESR. Plasma characteristics are also important determinants of the ESR. Other factors that can change ESR include age, sex, race, medications and disease states, such as obesity, hypofibrinogenaemia and congestive heart failure. Other acute-phase reactants besides the ESR include C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, complement, ferritin, plasma viscosity, serum amyloid A and albumin. When clinical suspicion for infection or inflammation is low, a normal ESR can reassure that there is no active disease. The slow rise (48h) and fall of the ESR relative to other acute-phase reactants may make it superior for monitoring inflammation in more chronic conditions. In conjunction with physical findings and other laboratory values, the ESR value can be used to screen for disease or disease complications, aid in disease diagnosis or assess disease activity or response to therapy.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2023 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute bacterial arthritis in pediatrics [^115zmfGm]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) — interpretive value and limitations: The Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) is usually, but not always, elevated in children with ABA at presentation and is usually higher in ABA than in transient nonbacterial synovitis or acute rheumatic fever, but overlap of ESR ranges precludes discriminatory utility, and the ESR often does not normalize until the fourth week after initiation of therapy; therefore, the Guideline Panel does not see value in the routine inclusion of ESR testing in children evaluated for suspected ABA to differentiate bacterial from non-bacterial causes of joint inflammation, the ESR does not substantially assist in pathogen assessment, and it has not been helpful for assessing adjacent musculoskeletal infection to determine need for extended antimicrobial therapy.

### Laboratory tests in adults with monoarticular arthritis: can they rule out a septic joint? [^11381ew7]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

It is difficult to differentiate septic arthritis from other causes of monoarticular arthritis solely with a history and physical examination. The clinician must rely on ancillary tests to make a diagnosis, such as the white blood cell count of peripheral blood (WBC), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and the white blood cell count of the joint fluid (jWBC) obtained from arthrocentesis. Although it is known that septic arthritis is associated with abnormalities in these tests, the majority of the data are based on studies in the pediatric population. In addition, although several emergency medicine texts indicate that a jWBC greater than 50,000 cells/mm(3) is "positive", it is known that septic arthritis can occur in patients with low jWBCs.

Objectives

To determine whether specific ancillary tests have sufficiently high sensitivities to rule out septic arthritis in adults.

Methods

This was a retrospective consecutive case series of patients from an urban emergency department (ED). Patients at least 18 years old who had septic arthritis confirmed by positive arthrocentesis culture or operative findings were included in the study. WBC greater than 11,000 cells/mm(3), ESR greater than 30 mm/hr, and jWBC greater than 50,000 cells/mm(3) were considered elevated.

Results

Seventy-three patients met the inclusion criteria. The sensitivities of an elevated WBC, ESR, or jWBC in adults who had septic arthritis were 48%, 96%, and 64%, respectively. There were broad ranges of WBC, ESR, or jWBC among the patients. More than one third of adult patients with septic arthritis had jWBCs less than 50,000 cells/mm(3). All patients had an abnormality in at least one of these tests.

Conclusions

The WBC, ESR, and jWBC are extremely variable in adults with septic arthritis. Laboratory tests do not rule out septic arthritis with accuracy.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^114khZJE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease — laboratory markers in suspected disease: Anemia and an elevated platelet count are the most common changes seen in the complete blood count; C-reactive protein is elevated in a subset of patients with a short half-life of 19 hours, making CRP a useful marker to detect and monitor inflammation; erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be useful in an individual patient, but it is not predictive of IBD and does not discriminate patients with IBD from those with IBS in healthy controls; up to 40% of patients with IBD with mild inflammation may have a normal CRP and ESR, limiting the usefulness of these markers in monitoring some patients.

### Erythrocyte sedimentation rate: use of fresh blood for quality control [^114LRjB9]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) remains the most widely used laboratory test for monitoring the course of infections, inflammatory diseases, and some types of cancer. Several test methods have been developed recently, and as a result the safety and reliability of ESR testing procedures have improved. The method recommended by the International Council for Standardization in Haematology and the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards for ESR measurement is based on the traditional Westergren method, using EDTA-anticoagulated samples without dilution. In clinical laboratories, reliable methods for calibration and the use of appropriate control materials are requiredfor monitoring the accuracy and precision of the routine method. We describe and evaluate a procedure for achieving the daily quality control of ESR and for establishing the limits of agreement between working and reference methods. Data from routine patient samples were used to calculate the daily cumulative mean and to monitor its reproducibility over time. Finally, to monitor analytic performance, a comparison was made between results from the measurement of ESR in specimens stored at 4 degrees C for 24 hours and results obtained in fresh samples.

### Premature therapeutic antimicrobial treatments can compromise the diagnosis of late periprosthetic joint infection [^114TEddd]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In the absence of positive cultures and draining sinuses, the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) relies on laboratory values. It is unknown if administration of antibiotics within 2 weeks before diagnostic evaluations can affect these tests in patients with PJI.

Questions/Purposes

The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation of antibiotic administration with (1) fluctuations in the synovial fluid and serology laboratory values; and (2) sensitivity of the diagnostic tests in patients with late PJI (per Musculoskeletal Infection Society [MSIS] criteria).

Methods

Synovial white blood cell (WBC) count, polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) percentage, and serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) as well as culture results were investigated in 161 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty with late PJI diagnosed with the MSIS criteria. Depending on whether presampling antibiotics were used, patients were divided in two groups (53 [33%] patients were on antibiotics). The median laboratory values and the false-negative rates were compared between the two groups.

Results

The median of all variables were lower in the antibiotic group compared with the other group: ESR (mm/hr): 70 versus 85, difference of medians (DOM) = 15 mm/hr, p = 0.018; CRP (mg/L): 72 versus 130, DOM = 58 mg/L, p = 0.038; synovial WBC (cells/μL): 29,170 versus 46,900, DOM = 17,730, p = 0.022; and synovial PMN%: 88.5% versus 92.5%, DOM = 4%, p = 0.012. Furthermore, using the MSIS cutoffs, the false-negative rates of several parameters were higher in the antibiotic group; ESR: 19.2% (nine of 47) versus 6.1% (six of 99) (relative risk, 3.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–8.3; p = 0.020); CRP: 14.9% (seven of 47) versus 2.00% (two of 100) (relative risk, 7.4; 95% CI, 1.6–34.4); PMN%: 23.1% (12 of 52) versus 9.4% (10 of 106) (relative risk, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1–5.2; p = 0.027). Patients in the antibiotic group also had higher rates of negative cultures: 26.4% (14 of 53) versus 12.9% (14 of 108) (relative risk, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.05–3.9; p = 0.046).

Conclusions

It appears that premature antibiotic treatments are associated with lower medians of diagnostic laboratory values. Thus, and in line with the guideline recommendations of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, patients with suspected late-PJI should not receive antibiotics until the diagnosis is reached or refuted.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the laboratory evaluation of functional diarrhea and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in adults (IBS-D) [^112URHZp]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

AGA guideline — screening for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C‑reactive protein (CRP): "Recommendation 2: In patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, the AGA suggests against the use of erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C‑reactive protein to screen for IBD. Conditional recommendation; low-quality evidence". Evidence summary shows that for CRP, "using a value of 5–6 mg/L as a threshold", pooled sensitivity was "0.73 (95% CI, 0.64–0.80)" and pooled specificity was "0.78 (95% CI, 0.58–0.91)", whereas ESR thresholds "10–15 mm/h… resulted in lower estimates of diagnostic accuracy for IBD". A pragmatic note states that "if testing for fecal lactoferrin or calprotectin are either not available or not covered by insurance, the use of CRP might be considered to be a reasonable option to screen for IBD".

### ESR statement on the validation of imaging biomarkers [^114dHnrL]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Patient summary

In a number of areas of medicine, tests such as blood or urine sampling can measure certain characteristics by which a particular disease or biological process can be identified – these characteristics specific to a disease or biological process are called biomarkers. In medical imaging, it is difficult to produce reliable biomarkers because of complexities involved in collecting and analysing data from images. Equipment (scanners) from different manufacturers or the use of different methodologies for data analysis means that the measurements from different institutions or even within the same institution are often difficult to compare. Hence, despite technological advances, his lack of standardisation has prevented imaging biomarkers from significantly impacting clinical practice. This paper discusses how imaging biomarkers can be clinically validated based on metrology - the science of measurement – to ensure that variability between centres is minimised. This should enable imaging biomarkers to be used for diagnosis, prognosis or treatment response, with the ultimate aim of improving clinical workflows and patient care.

### Very late relapses in Hodgkin lymphoma treated with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy: linear pattern and distinct prognostic factors [^116kgsyU]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Individual graphs refer to the whole patient population overall (A) and according to histologic subtype (cHL classical Hodgkin lymphoma, MC mixed cellularity, NLPHL nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma) (B), radiotherapy (RT) administration (C) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (D). In addition, cumulative incidence of very late relapses and competing-risks-adjusted cumulative incidence at different time-points from diagnosis in patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma treated with ABVD or equivalent regimens (E, F) and according to histologic subtype (cHL classical Hodgkin lymphoma, MC mixed cellularity) (G), radiotherapy (RT) administration (H), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (I) and age (J).

Univariate and multivariate prognostic factor analysis is provided in Table 1. In univariate analysis of all patients, age ≥ 45 years and MC were associated with higher probability of VLRs, while ABVDeq vs. MOPPeq CT ± RT and CMT vs. CT alone were associated with lower VLR incidence (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2 and Fig. 1C). Clinical stage and B-symptoms were of borderline significance (p = 0.11 and 0.13; Table 1); interestingly however, elevated ESR ≥ 50 mm/h was inversely associated with the incidence of VLR (Table 1 and Fig. 1D). Focusing on histology, MC was associated with higher VLR incidence compared to non-MC cHL, mainly driven by the favorable effect of NS, while NLP was marginally associated with more VLRs compared to non-MC cHL (Table 1 and Fig. 1B). In multivariate analysis (Table 1), independent protective factors for VLRs were CMT vs. CT (HR = 0.35, p < 0.001) and elevated ESR (≥ 50 vs. < 50 mm/h; HR = 0.46, p = 0.008), while MC was independent adverse factor (HR = 2.19, p = 0.004). If ESR (with associated missing values) was not considered, ABVDeq CT vs. MOPP-type was protective against VLRs (HR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.27–0.94, p = 0.032) in the presence of other significant predictors (CMT/CT and MC) (data not shown).

### Promoting appropriate utilisation of laboratory tests for inflammation at an academic medical centre [^114wu1HY]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Background

CRP is a specific acute phase reactant associated with inflammation and infection, and ESR is a non-specific measure of the acute phase reaction. ESR is influenced by many factors, both inflammatory and non-inflammatory, such as blood viscosity, age, sex and other chronic conditions such as renal disease, obesity and heart failure. Thus, an elevated ESR has limited specificity for inflammation. ESR may remain elevated even after the CRP has returned to baseline. These characteristics make CRP the preferred test for detecting acute phase inflammation in patients with undiagnosed conditions. Simultaneous ordering of ESR and CRP has been shown to increase costs without evidence of improving diagnostic accuracy or patient outcomes. Interventions incorporating education, audit and feedback and computerised clinical decision support (CDS) have been associated with reductions in ESR testing in hospitals. The clinical appropriateness of residual ESR testing following such interventions and the estimated changes in costs of laboratory testing have not been reported.

### Inflammation, as measured by the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, is an independent predictor for the development of heart failure [^111s83um]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Our objective was to explore inflammation, measured as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), as a predictor for the development of heart failure (HF).

Background

In recent years, evidence of the importance of inflammation in the pathophysiology of HF has emerged, and various inflammatory markers have been found to predict future HF. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is an inexpensive and easily accessible marker of systemic inflammation, but to this date it is unknown whether ESR predicts subsequent HF.

Methods

In a community-based prospective study of 2,314 middle-aged men free from HF, myocardial infarction, and valvular disease at baseline, ESR was analyzed in multivariable models together with established risk factors for HF (hypertension, diabetes, electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy, smoking, obesity, and serum cholesterol) and hematocrit.

Results

A total of 282 men developed HF during a median follow-up time of 30 years. In Cox proportional hazards analyses, ESR was an independent predictor of HF (hazard ratio 1.46 for highest quartile vs. the lowest, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 2.06). This observation remained significant when also adjusting for interim myocardial infarction during follow-up.

Conclusions

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was a significant predictor of HF, independent of established risk factors for HF, and interim myocardial infarction after three decades of follow-up in a population-based sample of middle-aged men. Our findings indicate that inflammation occurs early in the process leading to HF and that ESR could be used to evaluate this process.

### DAS28-CRP and DAS28-ESR cut-offs for high disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis are not interchangeable [^114xb2WQ]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Results

The COMET trial included 265 patients who received ETN 50 mg+MTX QW and 263 who received MTX QW; the trial results have been reported in detail elsewhere. The study participants had early RA with a mean (SE) disease duration of 9.0 (0.3) months and active disease: mean (SD) swollen joint count (SJC) 17.3 (10.2) out of 68 joints, tender joint count (TJC) 25.0 (14.5) out of 71 joints, ESR 48.5 (24.0) mm/hour and CRP 36.7 (36.1) mg/L. The percentage of patients with moderate disease activity (MDA, defined as DAS28-ESR ≥ 3.2 to ≤ 5.1) in the ETN+MTX and MTX groups was 21/265 (7.9%) and 20/263 (7.6%), respectively.

### Association of C-reactive protein with high disease activity in systemic sclerosis: results from the Canadian scleroderma research group [^112B7m2a]. Arthritis Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was performed to determine the prevalence of elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and the significance of CRP in clinical parameters in systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) patients.

Methods

Canadian Scleroderma Research Group data were used. Statistical comparisons were made for CRP levels ≤ 8 mg/liter versus > 8 mg/liter, early (≤ 3 years from first non-Raynaud's phenomenon symptom) versus late SSc, and diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) versus limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc). A survival analysis was analyzed between patients with normal versus elevated CRP levels.

Results

A total of 1,043 patients (mean ± SD age 55.4 ± 12.1 years, mean ± SD disease duration of 11.0 ± 9.5 years) were analyzed; elevation of CRP level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; > 20 mm/hour) occurred in 25.7% and 38.2%, respectively. Mean ± SD baseline CRP level in dcSSc (11.98 ± 25.41 mg/liter) was higher than in lcSSc (8.15 ± 16.09 mg/liter; P = 0.016). SSc patients with an early disease duration had a higher mean ± SD CRP level (12.89 ± 28.13 mg/liter) than those with a late disease duration (8.60 ± 17.06 mg/liter; P = 0.041). Although not consistent in all subsets, CRP was significantly associated (P < 0.01) with ESR, modified Rodnan skin score (MRSS), worse pulmonary function parameters, disease activity, damage, and Health Assessment Questionnaire. CRP level seemed to normalize in many SSc patients over time. Total lung capacity < 80% predicted, MRSS, and serum creatinine were predictors of elevated CRP levels in SSc (odds ratio [OR] 2.76 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.73–4.40], P = 0.0001; OR 1.03 [95% CI 1.01–1.05], P = 0.005; and OR 1.005 [95% CI 1.001–1.010], P = 0.02, respectively). Survival for patients with elevated CRP levels was less than for patients with normal CRP levels (P = 0.001).

Conclusion

CRP level is elevated in one-quarter of SSc patients, especially early disease. It is correlated with disease activity, severity, poor pulmonary function, and shorter survival.

### Promoting appropriate utilisation of laboratory tests for inflammation at an academic medical centre [^115jFBYD]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Strategy

Prior to developing our interventions, we conducted an email survey of selected physician leaders in groups with high ESR utilisation rates to investigate reasons for the current practice. Five open-ended questions explored: (A) perceived drivers of combined ESR/CRP testing, (B) potential negative impact of reducing ESR testing, (C) clinical situations in which ESR would be preferable to CRP, (D) potential barriers to change and (E) anticipated impact of EMR CDS on the clinical practice of their group.

We performed an informal thematic analysis of survey results, which identified several recurring themes. Surveyed physicians across different specialties indicated low awareness that CRP was a more sensitive and specific test for acute phase inflammation and that the American Society for Clinical Pathology recommended against ordering an ESR in this clinical scenario. Clinical habit and ease of test ordering were identified as key drivers of ESR overuse. In addition, several surveyed physicians identified specific disease states or clinical scenarios where they felt ESR provided additive or more accurate clinical information than CRP, and thus, completely eliminating ESR use would not be a clinically prudent or feasible goal. One surveyed physician indicated that she preferred ESR because she (mistakenly) believed it was a less expensive test than CRP. As anticipated, there was a general concern that EMR changes would make it more difficult to order appropriate tests.

### Sensitivity of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein in childhood bone and joint infections [^111wJzgn]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

In addition to the examination of clinical signs, several laboratory markers have been measured for diagnostics and monitoring of pediatric septic bone and joint infections. Traditionally erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and leukocyte cell count have been used, whereas C-reactive protein (CRP) has gained in popularity. We monitored 265 children at ages 3 months to 15 years with culture-positive osteoarticular infections with a predetermined series of ESR, CRP, and leukocyte count measurements. On admission, ESR exceeded 20 mm/hour in 94% and CRP exceeded 20 mg/L in 95% of the cases, the mean (± standard error of the mean) being 51 ± 2 mm/hour and 87 ± 4 mg/L, respectively. ESR normalized in 24 days and CRP in 10 days. Elevated CRP gave a slightly better sensitivity in diagnostics than ESR, but best sensitivity was gained with the combined use of ESR and CRP (98%). Elevated ESR or CRP was seen in all cases during the first 3 days. Measuring ESR and CRP on admission can help the clinician rule out an acute osteoarticular infection. CRP normalizes faster than ESR, providing a clear advantage in monitoring recovery.

### Routine diagnostic tests for periprosthetic joint infection demonstrate a high false-negative rate and are influenced by the infecting organism [^112Nhapw]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) as the first-line testing for evaluation of suspected periprosthetic joint infection, in addition to synovial white blood-cell (WBC) count and polymorphonuclear percentage. However, the sensitivity and other diagnostic measures of these tests using a standardized definition of periprosthetic joint infection and the influence of organisms on these inflammatory markers remain inadequately investigated.

Methods

A retrospective review of an institutional database of 549 periprosthetic joint infection cases and 653 aseptic total joint arthroplasty revisions was performed. Periprosthetic joint infection was defined using major criteria from the International Consensus Meeting (ICM) on Periprosthetic Joint Infection. The mean inflammatory marker levels were compared among organisms with Student t tests and the proportions of elevated laboratory levels were compared among organisms with chi-square analyses. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed to calculate new cutoffs, sensitivities, and specificities for each organism and overall for serum CRP and ESR and synovial WBC and polymorphonuclear percentage.

Results

The sensitivity of these markers for diagnosing chronic periprosthetic joint infection was 0.85 for ESR, 0.88 for CRP, 0.83 for WBC count, and 0.78 for polymorphonuclear percentage. For ESR, antibiotic-resistant organisms had higher mean values (84.3 mm/hr) than culture-negative cases (57.4 mm/hr), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (68.3 mm/hr), and Streptococcus species (66.1 mm/hr); Staphylococcus aureus (81.0 mm/hr) was higher than culture-negative cases (57.4 mm/hr). For CRP, culture-negative cases had lower mean values (41.0 mg/L) than gram-negative organisms (87.4 mg/L), antibiotic-resistant organisms (86.0 mg/L), S. aureus (112.2 mg/L), and Streptococcus species (114.6 mg/L); S. aureus (112.2 mg/L) was higher than coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (66.0 mg/L). For WBC count, culture-negative cases had lower mean values (27,984.5 cells/mL) than S. aureus (116,250.0 cells/mL) and Streptococcus species (77,933.7 cells/mL). For polymorphonuclear percentage, there were no significant differences in mean values among all organisms.

Conclusions

It appears that serological markers, namely ESR and CRP, have a higher false-negative rate than previously reported. Synovial markers similarly exhibit high false-negative rates. Furthermore, the sensitivity of these tests appears to be related to organism type. Surgeons should be aware of the high rate of false-negatives associated with low-virulence organisms and culture-negative cases.

### Determinants of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the era of microinflammation: excluding subjects with elevated C-reactive protein levels [^115BmcFi]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) can be used to identify low-grade inflammation that contributes to future vascular events. ESR determinants, however, have not been explored in the absence of a subclinical or microinflammatory response. The ESR was determined in a large cohort of apparently healthy participants, excluding subjects with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) concentrations more than 5 mg/L (47.62 nmol/L). Linear regression models were used to identify the determinants of the ESR. The study population comprised 6,237 subjects. The main laboratory variables found to affect ESR were levels of fibrinogen, hemoglobin, globulin, and triglycerides (all P < .001; R2 = 0.34 and 0.44 for men and women, respectively). Sex was found to affect ESR alone and in combined interactions with most other variables. Age did not affect ESR. The main determinants of ESR in an inflammation-free cohort are sex and levels of fibrinogen, hemoglobin, globulins, and triglycerides.

### Medical imaging in personalised medicine: a white paper of the research committee of the European Society of Radiology (ESR) [^11282Z7T]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Evaluation of treatment response

Imaging plays an important role in the assessment of therapeutic response. Classically decreased morbidity, e.g. relief of symptoms, and mortality have been endpoints for treatment evaluation. In most diseases treatment response can be evaluated more objectively, reproducibly and earlier with imaging than by monitoring symptoms. An early and accurate therapeutic response evaluation is critical in PM as it can influence the decision on discontinuation of treatment, treatment adjustment and/or additional treatment. Imaging can spare patients from prolonged exposure to ineffective treatments and allow alternative therapies to be applied sooner. Imaging not only plays a role in assessing response to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and/or targeted therapies, but also in the monitoring of changes after image-guided intervention.

Timing of response evaluation can differ according to clinical needs. To prevent aggressive treatment — which could be accompanied by severe side effects or expensive treatment in non-responders — it is crucial to evaluate early response in order to discontinue treatment and consider a second-line treatment that is potentially more effective. However, final treatment response evaluation is needed to decide on subsequent surgical treatment or neo-adjuvant treatment after presurgical chemoradiotherapy.

Crucial in the evaluation of treatment is the assumption that early tumour response is related to the final treatment response and that both early and final treatment responses are related to overall survival and/or progression-free survival. Multiple studies have already been performed that demonstrated these relationships. It is now time to integrate and translate these findings into clinical trial design and clinical guidelines, which describe the clinical decisions based on the results of imaging tests. This is especially the case with the further expansion of cancer management based on PET imaging. For example:
In colorectal cancer, PET of the liver could predict tumour response to chemotherapy in liver metastasis, and PET of the pelvis during or after (chemo)radiotherapy could predict the final tumour response and overall survival.
Patients with advanced oesophageal cancer and no evidence of response to neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy on PET imaging, which occurs in 50% of the patients, have a worse prognosis after surgical resection than patients who respond, even after radical surgical resection.
For both limited stage and advanced stage Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple studies have demonstrated that interim PET imaging has a high negative predictive value and a moderate positive predictive value for progression-free survival. Multiple trials are evaluating the effect of treatment adaption based on early PET evaluation on progression-free survival. These studies will determine whether therapy can be safely escalated or reduced based on treatment response evaluation.

### Laboratory investigations useful in giant cell arteritis and Takayasu's arteritis [^1159TF3b]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

A raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is considered a hallmark for the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA). The American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for GCA include ESR greater than or equal to 50 mm/h as one of the five criteria. Although the presence of a normal ESR made GCA less likely, the results of a population-based study showed that the occurrence of a low/normal value in GCA at diagnosis is not rare. Pre-treatment ESR may be a prognostic indicator for duration of treatment. C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) may be more sensitive indicators of disease activity than ESR in GCA patients. However, it is unclear whether the use in clinical practice of CRP and IL-6 has some apparent advantage over ESR. ESR is the most often used tool to assess disease activity in Takayasu's arteritis (TA). However, some studies have found that ESR and CRP are not able to differentiate patients with clinically active and inactive TA. Furthermore, histopathological studies have shown that over 40% of patients thought to be in clinical remission with normal acute phase reactants have active arteritis. IL-6 could be a promising marker of disease activity in TA; however, further studies are required to confirm its usefulness in clinical practice. Other laboratory investigations could be useful in the diagnosis or follow-up of GCA and TA, but more studies are required.

### An evidence-based approach to laboratory tests in usual care of patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^116KKAsc]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Laboratory tests often are regarded as the most important information in clinical care by patients and doctors, and dominate clinical decisions in many chronic diseases such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Most patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a positive test for rheumatoid factor or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA), or an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP). However, about a third of RA patients, have negative tests for rheumatoid factor or ACPA, and more than 40% have a normal ESR or CRP at presentation ('false-negative' results). Furthermore, many normal people have a positive test for rheumatoid factor or ACPA but do not have RA, even among those with extensive musculoskeletal pain ('false-positive' results). Abnormal laboratory tests are the most significant predictor of high levels of radiographic progression, and therefore regarded as indicators of 'poor prognosis RA'. By contrast, laboratory tests are far less predictive of severe long-term outcomes such as work disability and premature mortality than functional difficulties reported on a patient questionnaire. A patient questionnaire score is abnormal in 89% of RA patients at presentation, and therefore more useful than ESR or CRP to document subsequent clinical improvement or deterioration. In clinical practice, patient questionnaire scores and RAPID3, an index of physical function, pain, and patient global estimate of status, identify incomplete responses to methotrexate more effectively than ESR. Improved understanding of the limitations of laboratory tests in diagnosis and management of individual patients with RA (and all rheumatic diseases) could improve patient care and outcomes.

XII. Systemic inflammatory markers and MRI for assessing treatment response in native vertebral osteomyelitis — We suggest monitoring systemic inflammatory markers (ESR or CRP) in patients with NVO after approximately 4 weeks of antimicrobial therapy, in conjunction with a clinical assessment (weak, low), and we recommend against routinely ordering follow-up MRI in patients with NVO in whom a favorable clinical and laboratory response to antimicrobial therapy was observed (strong, low). We suggest performing a follow-up MRI to assess evolutionary changes of the epidural and paraspinal soft tissues in patients with NVO who are judged to have a poor clinical response to therapy (weak, low). Patients with at least a 25%–33% reduction in systemic inflammatory markers after receipt of approximately 4 weeks of antimicrobial therapy may be at reduced risk of treatment failure, and NVO patients with a 50% reduction in ESR after 4 weeks rarely develop treatment failure; conversely, after 4 weeks of treatment, ESR values > 50 mm/ hour and CRP values ≥ 2.75 mg/dL may confer a significantly higher risk of treatment failure. NVO patients who demonstrate favorable clinical and laboratory response to therapy do not need to undergo follow-up MRI, follow-up imaging performed < 4 weeks after the baseline exam may falsely suggest progressive infection, and improvement in paravertebral and epidural soft tissue on follow-up MRI correlates best with improvement in clinical status and outcomes; in patients with worsened soft tissue findings on MRI 4–8 weeks after diagnosis, microbiologically confirmed treatment failure rates as high as 44% are reported.

### Procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in children [^1169odhT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In children with urinary tract infection (UTI), only those with pyelonephritis (and not cystitis) are at risk for developing long-term renal sequelae. If non-invasive biomarkers could accurately differentiate children with cystitis from children with pyelonephritis, treatment and follow-up could potentially be individualized.

Objectives

The objectives of this review were to 1) determine whether procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) can replace the acute DMSA scan in the diagnostic evaluation of children with UTI; 2) assess the influence of patient and study characteristics on the diagnostic accuracy of these tests, and 3) compare the performance of the three tests to each other.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, DARE, Web of Science, and BIOSIS Previews for this review. The reference lists of all included articles and relevant systematic reviews were searched to identify additional studies not found through the electronic search.

Selection Criteria

We only considered published studies that evaluated the results of an index test (procalcitonin, CRP, ESR) against the results of an acute-phase DMSA scan (conducted within 30 days of the UTI) in children aged 0 to 18 years with a culture-confirmed episode of UTI. The following cutoff values were used for the primary analysis: 0.5 ng/mL for procalcitonin, 20 mg/L for CRP and 30 mm/h for ESR.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently applied the selection criteria to all citations and independently abstracted data. We used the bivariate model to calculate pooled random-effects pooled sensitivity and specificity values.

Main Results

A total of 24 studies met our inclusion criteria. Seventeen studies provided data for the primary analysis: six studies (434 children) included data on procalcitonin, 13 studies (1638 children) included data on CRP, and six studies (1737 children) included data on ESR (some studies had data on more than one test). The summary sensitivity estimates (95% CI) for the procalcitonin, CRP, ESR tests at the aforementioned cutoffs were 0.86 (0.72 to 0.93), 0.94 (0.85 to 0.97), and 0.87 (0.77 to 0.93), respectively. The summary specificity values for procalcitonin, CRP, and ESR tests at these cutoffs were 0.74 (0.55 to 0.87), 0.39 (0.23 to 0.58), and 0.48 (0.33 to 0.64), respectively.

Authors' Conclusions

The ESR test does not appear to be sufficiently accurate to be helpful in differentiating children with cystitis from children with pyelonephritis. A low CRP value (< 20 mg/L) appears to be somewhat useful in ruling out pyelonephritis (decreasing the probability of pyelonephritis to < 20%), but unexplained heterogeneity in the data prevents us from making recommendations at this time. The procalcitonin test seems better suited for ruling in pyelonephritis, but the limited number of studies and the marked heterogeneity between studies prevents us from reaching definitive conclusions. Thus, at present, we do not find any compelling evidence to recommend the routine use of any of these tests in clinical practice.

### AAOS systematic literature review: summary on the management of surgical site infections [^114bokvK]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). High credibility.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for surgical site infection (SSI) diagnosis — Limited strength evidence does not support the use of ESR, alone, to rule in and rule out surgical site infections due to conflicting data, with the Strength of Recommendation: Limited. Multiple high-quality studies have demonstrated moderate to weak ability of ESR as a solitary test to diagnose or exclude surgical site infection, and it is felt to be too variable with respect to time from surgery and in the presence of other confounding factors to be considered an accurate tool in diagnosis alone; ESR may be considered as a tool to be used in conjunction with other tests. There is no risk with implementation of this test/recommendation; however, ESR should rarely be considered in isolation, and ESR should be used in combination with other tests to mitigate the risk of incorrect diagnoses. Future investigations will likely examine the use of ESR in combination with other diagnostic markers.

### Variability in phenotype and response to treatment in chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis; the Irish experience of a national cohort [^1113jT8w]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Laboratory data

Twenty-six patients (59.1%) had an elevated ESR at presentation. Of these, ESR was mildly elevated (< 50 mm/hr) in 19/26 (73.1%), moderately elevated (50–100 mm/hr) in 6/26 (23.1%) and highly elevated (> 100 mm/hr) in 1/26 (3.8%). In the six patients who presented systemically unwell with fever, ESR was normal in 1/6, mildly elevated in 2/6, moderately elevated in 2/6 and highly elevated in 1/6. CRP was less frequently elevated than ESR; 9/10 patients with a raised CRP also had a raised ESR and one did not have an ESR result available. CRP was elevated in 4/6 of the patients who were febrile at presentation. Total white cell count (WCC) was normal in all but one patient; that patient had highly elevated ESR and CRP with a mildly elevated white cell and neutrophil count. Six patients (15.7%, n = 38) were HLA-B✱27 positive compared to 8.4% of the Irish population.

### ESR / ERS white paper on lung cancer screening [^112peUNa]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

We also recommend the implementation of the following measures in order to increase quality, outcome and cost-effectiveness of lung cancer screening:
To increase the pre-test probability by using a risk model and considering additional risk factors.
To reduce the effective radiation dose to less than 1 mSv per CT examination for all participants.
To use volumetric measurements for the assessment of growth rate (tumour doubling time) in order to reduce the rate of false-positives.
To use computer-assisted systems for automated detection, optimised measurements and follow-up, providing structured reports on nodule volume, localisation, phenotype and standard operating procedure-based suggestions for further management plan.
To adapt screening intervals based on refined risk models.
To include additional CT findings such as COPD and vascular calcification.
To include and study biomarkers to better define screening subgroups and refine nodule management.

### ESR statement on the validation of imaging biomarkers [^112iVrUE]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Key points

Unlike blood or urine analysis where the samples are obtained by simple extraction or excretion, in radiology the acquisition of the sample (the images) is heterogeneous by design, since complex equipment from different vendors is used.
The validation of developed analytical methods must be based on a technical performance validation (precision - repeatability and reproducibility - and accuracy assessment) and clinical validation.
Metrology is the scientific domain in which imaging biomarkers must be validated, as with other measurement devices.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2023 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute bacterial arthritis in pediatrics [^112BhY4m]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) response monitoring — In children with presumed or confirmed ABA receiving antimicrobial therapy with or without surgical intervention, in addition to serial clinical evaluation, we suggest performing C-reactive protein (CRP) at initial evaluation followed by sequential monitoring of CRP to assess response to therapy, rather than relying solely on clinical evaluation (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence); Serial clinical examination that assess the febrile response, pain and musculoskeletal function remain the primary means of monitoring response to treatment. Gradual clinical improvement including resolution of fever over 2 to 4 days is generally expected; CRP typically has a peak on day 2–3 in uncomplicated infection and returns to the normal range in about 9 to 12 days. The consensus of the Guideline Panel is that CRP may be evaluated every 2 or 3 days until the concentration begins to drop consistently, and once the CRP concentration has decreased substantially in the context of ongoing clinical improvement, further measurement is not necessary. A declining CRP concentration can be used to provide information supplementary to the clinical course for determining when a child may be transitioned to oral antimicrobial therapy and/or discharged home, and successful transition to oral therapy after good clinical response plus CRP decline by 50% or more has been described. If serial CRPs fail to trend downward or resume an upward trend, particularly with recurrent symptoms, children should be carefully evaluated for persistent ABA or adjacent osteomyelitis and may require advanced imaging such as MRI. The role of other inflammatory markers, such as serum procalcitonin (PCT), has not been established; the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) has limited utility and in one study took a mean of 18 days to normalize; normalization or substantial decline in the blood white blood cell (WBC) count over the first few days is consistent with response but has not been prospectively evaluated adequately as a biomarker of recovery.

### Limited value of elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate as an indicator of malignancy [^117PxHFd]. Family Practice (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are often suspected of having malignant disease and are subjected to extensive investigations. Thus, the finding of an elevated ESR can result in considerable costs and might even be dangerous for the patient if invasive studies are ordered.

Objectives

Our aims were to establish (i) the prevalence of malignant diseases in hospitalized patients and out-patients with elevated ESR; and (ii) the long-term incidence of malignant diseases in patients during 5 years after unsuccessful investigation for elevated ESR.

Methods

A cross-sectional survey was carried out in 128 patients admitted to the Department of General Internal Medicine, University of Kiel and in 94 out-patients under the care of a GP. A retrospective cohort study of 50 patients was also carried out by contacting GPs of patients discharged from hospital after unsuccessful investigation.

Results

In the hospitalized patients, the ESR was elevated in 53.1% (68/128) and was normal in 46.9% (60/128). Malignancy was found in 25.0% (17/68) of patients with elevated ESR and in 15% (9/60) of patients with normal ESR (P = 0.16). Of the out-patients, 94 patients with elevated ESR were investigated, of whom 8.5% (8/94) had malignancies (P = 0.004 compared with hospitalized patients). In the follow-up study of 50 patients who had been discharged with the diagnosis "elevated ESR of unknown origin", follow-up information was available from 38 individuals. Of these, 71.0% (27/38) had not developed signs or symptoms of any disease at the time of investigation. Malignant disease had developed in only 5.3% (2/38).

Conclusion

The prevalence of malignancy in patients with elevated ESR is low, in both the clinical and the general practice setting. Elevation of ESR is not an early sign of malignant disease and does not justify extensive investigation in a patient who has no symptoms which are suggestive of a tumour.

### Impact of antiinflammatory treatment on the onset of uveitis in juvenile idiopathic arthritis: longitudinal analysis from a nationwide pediatric rheumatology database [^111S35N4]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

High disease activity has been reported to be associated with a higher risk of uveitis occurrence in JIA 53, 63, but the subsequent clinical course of uveitis appears to be quite independent of arthritis activity 64. The C‐HAQ score is a sensitive tool for evaluating functional outcomes in children with chronic arthritis 65. In our study, patients with a high C‐HAQ score at initial documentation revealed a significantly higher risk for uveitis onset during further followup. Such a correlation was also found for the JADAS (also including the ESR as a parameter) and the cJADAS in our study. Indeed, the risk for uveitis occurrence during followup was nearly twice as high for patients with a cJADAS > 10 at first documentation than for those with a lower JADAS (HR 1.64, P = 0.047).

Apart from demographic and clinical data, further biomarkers to predict uveitis risk for an individual patient are highly desirable. Interestingly, ESR has been shown to correlate well with the risk for uveitis 66, 67, 68, 69. In our study, an ESR > 35 mm/hour at first documentation was associated with a significantly higher risk for uveitis onset during followup (OR 2.0, P < 0.001; univariate analysis) (Table 1). This is even more interesting considering that these children were treated more frequently with DMARDs (data not shown).

Although there are indications that DMARDs may reduce the risk for uveitis in JIA 29, 49, such an effect was not clearly confirmed in other studies 70, which showed a nearly stable uveitis prevalence despite more frequent use of DMARDs. In our large cohort, we found a significantly lower risk for uveitis onset in patients with MTX as a monotherapy than in patients not taking any DMARDs. This effect was even stronger if MTX was initiated at an early stage of disease (Figure 2) or when combined with a TNF inhibitor (Figures 1 and 2), and even more pronounced in the subgroup analysis for patients at high risk for uveitis, namely RF‐negative polyarthritis and oligoarthritis, persistent or extended.

### Consensus document for the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infections: a joint paper by the EANM, EBJIS, and ESR (with ESCMID endorsement) [^112XVsQL]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Early infection is often easy to recognize by acute pain in the wound area, redness, swelling, wound leakage, heat, and fever. Late infection is often caused by haematogenous spread, with symptoms from both the affected joint and the primary infection site. The main diagnostic problem is the delayed, often low-grade infection with mostly nonspecific symptoms. In all PJIs, a delay in starting an appropriate antibiotic regimen and surgical treatment has an important impact on the chance of saving the prosthesis and joint function. Therefore, early diagnosis is of utmost importance.

There is no single routine test available that can diagnose PJI with sufficient accuracy. Cultures, biopsies, serum inflammatory markers, and imaging techniques all have their pros and cons. C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and leukocyte count are not sensitive or specific enough to detect or exclude a PJI. Joint aspiration itself involves a risk of infection, and its sensitivity is highly variable. In general, a combination of clinical, laboratory, microbiological, and imaging tests are performed based on personal experience, techniques available in the institute, and cost aspects. Indeed, most signs and symptoms that might indicate the presence of a PJI may be simply related to an aseptic loosening of the prosthesis or to a soft tissue infection. Since loosening, soft tissue infection without osteomyelitis, and PJI require different treatment strategies (NSAIDs, antibiotic therapy, or surgery for explant and re-implant), the correct differential diagnosis among these clinical situations is crucial.

The development of biofilms plays a strategic role in the pathogenesis of PJI. Microorganisms adhere to the implant and form a biofilm, within which they are protected from the host immune system and most antibiotics. The most frequent etiologic agents are staphylococci, accounting for more than 50% of PJIs. Staphylococcus aureus is most commonly isolated in early infection, whereas coagulase-negative staphylococci are more frequent in late infection.

Other commonly isolated organisms in late infections are streptococci (9–10%), enterococci (3–7%), and anaerobes (2–4%). Gram-negative bacteria, mostly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp. and Proteus spp. even if relatively uncommon agents, have an important clinical impact because of the difficulty in treating them. Overall, about 20% of PJIs are polymicrobial and 7–11% are culture-negative. Unusual pathogens such as Candida spp. Brucella spp. and mycobacteria have also been reported.

### The prognostic value of markers of inflammation in patients with troponin T-negative chest pain before discharge from the emergency department [^112dC2Fm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the prognostic value of markers of inflammation for rule-out purposes in patients admitted to the emergency department with troponin T-negative chest pain.

Methods

Patients presenting to the emergency department within 6 hours of symptom onset and who had a normal or nondiagnostic electrocardiogram were eligible. The standard rule-out protocol, which included serial creatine kinase and creatine kinase-MB measurements, was applied, and markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and total white blood cell count and differential count) were measured. The study group comprised patients with negative serial troponin T results (< 0.06 microg/L) who were discharged home after unstable coronary artery disease was ruled out. Endpoints during the 6-month follow-up were cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or rehospitalization for unstable angina.

Results

A total of 382 troponin T-negative patients were discharged, of whom 2 died, 2 had a myocardial infarction, and 7 were rehospitalized for unstable angina. A positive C-reactive protein test result (> 0.3 mg/dL) was associated with future clinical events (hazard risk [HR] = 4.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2 to 17.0; P = 0.03), as was a positive test (> 13 mm/h) for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (HR = 5.6; 95% CI: 1.5 to 22.2; P = 0.01). Patients with positive results for both tests were at highest risk of clinical events (9.3%) compared with patients with other combinations of test results (1.1% to 2.1%; HR = 7.5; 95% CI: 2.2 to 25.5; P = 0.001).

Conclusion

The combination of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate had prognostic value in patients with troponin T-negative chest pain and a normal or nondiagnostic electrocardiogram in whom unstable coronary artery disease was ruled out.

### Raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate signals heart failure in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^111RnBLC]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Inflammatory markers are associated with heart failure. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis have twice the risk of heart failure compared with people without rheumatoid arthritis.

Objective

To assess whether heart failure in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is preceded by an inflammatory activation as shown by erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), a systemic marker of inflammation.

Methods

A population-based inception cohort of 575 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, free of heart failure at their rheumatoid arthritis incidence date, was followed up longitudinally until death or 2001. During 15 years of follow-up, they had a median of 15 ESR tests, and 172 patients had new-onset heart failure (Framingham Heart Study criteria). The follow-up period, beginning with the rheumatoid arthritis incidence date and ending with date of the last follow-up, was divided into 6-month intervals. The proportions of patients with at least one ESR value ≥ 40 mm/h and with anaemia (haemoglobin < 11 g/dl) within each 6-month interval were plotted against time from fulfilment of heart failure criteria. A binomial test was used to compare proportions.

Results

In patients with rheumatoid arthritis who developed heart failure, the proportion with ESR ≥ 40 mm/h was highest (23%) during the 6-month period immediately preceding the new-onset heart failure, as compared with the average ESR during the entire remaining follow-up period, both before and after heart failure (10.6%; p < 0.01). The proportion of patients with anaemia peaked (54%) during the 6-month period after heart failure.

Conclusions

Inflammatory stimuli may be involved in the initiation of heart failure among patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

### Cervical epidural abscess associated with massively elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate [^117RY11x]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

We present a case of an elderly woman who presented with neck pain, low-grade fever, bandemia, and a massively elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) who had a cervical epidural abscess. We believe that the selective use of ESR assisted in narrowing the differential diagnosis, as the patient had no neurological deficits and no predisposing factors such as distal infection, immunosuppression, trauma, or recent surgery. Furthermore, in the literature, an elevated ESR is consistently found in patients with epidural abscesses, whereas clinical findings such as fever, leukocytosis, and neurological deficits are only variably present.

### An open-label prospective randomized multicenter study of intensive versus weekly granulocyte and monocyte apheresis in active Crohn's disease [^116Hf66J]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Changes in leucocyte count, and inflammation markers

In spite of randomized assignment of enrolled patients, baseline leucocyte count (normal range: 4000–9000/μL), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (normal range: < 10 mm/hr (male); < 15 mm/hr (female)) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (normal range: < 0.3 mg/dL) concentration were found to be significantly higher in the intensive GMA group compared with the weekly GMA group, 8005/μL vs 7100/μL (P = 0.0273), 54.5 mm/hr vs 24.5 mm/hr (P = 0.0146) and 1.90 mg/dL vs 0.90 mg/dL (P = 0.0478), respectively. However, only in the intensive GMA group, leucocyte count (P = 0.0461) and ESR (P = 0.0059) were significantly reduced. Likewise, CRP level had decreased from 1.90 mg/dL to 0.80 mg/dL (P = 0.0941). In the weekly GMA, CRP level was significantly (P = 0.0277) decreased from 0.90 mg/dL at baseline to 0.35 mg/dL (P = 0.0277), but, leucocyte count and ESR level were not significantly affected (Table 2).

### Laboratory tests to assess patients with rheumatoid arthritis: advantages and limitations [^114phRLv]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Laboratory tests provide the most definitive information for diagnosing and managing many diseases, and most patients look to laboratory tests as the most important information from a medical visit. Most patients who have rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a positive test for rheumatoid factor and anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies, as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). More than 30% 40% of patients with RA, however, have negative tests for rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP antibodies or a normal ESR or CRP. More than 30% of patients with RA, however, have negative tests for rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP antibodies, and 40% have a normal ESR or CRP. These observations indicate that, although they can be helpful to monitor certain patients, laboratory measures cannot serve as a gold standard for diagnosis and management in all individual patients with RA or any rheumatic disease. Physicians and patients would benefit from an improved understanding of the limitations of laboratory tests in diagnosis and management of patients with RA.

### Assessment of placebo response in objective and subjective outcome measures in rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials [^112NUPm5]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Results

The data from 5 randomized clinical trials, representing 788 participants randomized to placebo control arms were included in this study (644 women [82%]; 144 men [18%]; mean [SD] age, 51 [13] years) (Table 1). All investigations were parallel, double-blind trials of at least 24 weeks' duration with double-blind placebo administration by vehicle-matched injection. There were statistically significant decreases from high baseline levels in pain intensity at week 12 (−14 mm; 95% CI, −12 to −16 mm) and week 24 (−20 mm; 95% CI, −16 to −22 mm), CRP level at week 12 (−0.51 mg/dL; 95% CI, −0.47 to −0.56 mg/dL) and week 24 (−1.16 mg/dL; 95% CI, −1.03 to −1.30 mg/dL) (to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10), and ESR at week 12 (−11 mm/h; 95% CI, −10 to −12 mm/h) and week 24 (−25 mm/h; 95% CI, −12 to −26 mm/h) (all P < .001) (Figure 1). When trial 5, which had the greatest placebo response and included patients naive to DMARDs, was excluded from the analysis (Figure 2), effects were smaller yet remained statistically significant. Pain levels decreased by 7 mm (95% CI, 5–9 mm) at week 12 and 12 mm (95% CI, 10–14 mm) at week 24, CRP levels decreased by 0.18 mg/dL (95% CI, 0.17–0.19 mg/dL) at week 12 and 0.91 mg/dL (95% CI, 0.84–1.00 mg/dL) at week 24, and ESR decreased by 8 mm/h (95% CI, 7–8 mm/h) at week 12 and 22 mm/h (95% CI, 21–23 mm/h) at week 24 (all P < .001). Results did not change substantially when last observation carried forward was used instead of exclusion of dropouts, and all results remained significant at P < .001.

### Distinguishing rheumatoid arthritis from psoriatic arthritis [^111awadD]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Serological features of RA and PsA

RA is a seropositive arthropathy, with approximately 80% of patients having a positive test result for RF or CCP antibodies.CCP antibodies are a more specific marker for RA than RF, but both biomarkers are considered to be distinct and complementary predictors of disability and joint erosion.

In contrast, PsA is a seronegative inflammatory arthropathy. RF and CCP are absent in most patients with PsA, and if patients do have positive test findings for RF or CCP, the titres are usually low. In a study comparing patients with RA or PsA and controls, the mean RF and anti-CCP titre values were substantially higher in patients with RA compared with PsA (RF titre: 56 vs 11 U/mL; anti-CCP titre: 14 vs 2 U/mL). Titres in patients with PsA were similar to values in controls. Although the presence of serum RF or CCP antibodies is generally not used to exclude diagnosis of non-rheumatic diseases (eg, fungal infections), data suggest that at anti-CCP titre values ≥ 11.6 U/mL, it is highly probable that patients have RA rather than PsA. In both patients with RA and PsA, the presence of anti-CCP antibodies is associated with bone destruction, suggesting that the osteocatabolic effect of anti-CCP antibodies is not found only in RA as previously thought.

C reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are markers of acute-phase inflammatory responses in patients with RA and PsA, but more so in patients with RA. In a systematic literature review of RA disease activity parameters, ESR and CRP levels were a significant predictor of radiographic progression in most studies. The acute-phase response is correlated with synovial inflammation, radiographic disease progression and erosive joint damage. On average, patients with PsA have significantly lower CRP and ESR levels than patients with RA. However, elevated ESR and CRP levels are significantly correlated with the number of swollen joints and with ultrasound abnormalities in PsA.ESR, in particular, is considered to be one of the best predictors of damage progression in PsA. It has been suggested that a low ESR is protective, while rates > 15 mm/hour are associated with increased risk for mortality. Changes in ESR and CRP correspond with clinical outcomes and can be used to track response to treatment.

Increased ESR and CRP levels are markers of inflammation, but not necessarily just in RA. Other rheumatological diseases associated with elevated ESR and CRP levels include polymyalgia rheumatica, Sjögren's syndrome and ankylosing spondylitis.

Figure 1.
Improvement in Pain Severity, C-Reactive Protein Level, and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate in Placebo Arm of 5 Randomized Clinical Trials

Values are means for pain (measured by a visual analog scale with values 0–100 mm) (A) and geometric means for C-reactive protein level (B) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (C) to account for log-normal distribution. All mean changes were significant (P < .001).

Figure 2.
Improvement in Pain Severity, C-Reactive Protein Level, and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate for Placebo Arms of Trials 1 Through 4

Values are means for pain (measured by a visual analog scale with values 0–100 mm) (A) and geometric means for C-reactive protein level (B) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (C) to account for log-normal distribution. All mean changes were significant (P < .001).

Correlations between week 12 and week 24 outcomes were moderate to high (pain: r = 0.73, CRP: r = 0.39, ESR: r = 0.59), and those between subjective and objective improvement were lower than those between objective measures (pain/CRP: r = 0.27, pain/ESR: r = 0.25, CRP/ESR: r = 0.48). While correlations between change and baseline were moderate (pain: r = 0.47, CRP: r = 0.39, ESR: r = 0.25), correlations between change and average of baseline and week 12 assessment were poor to nonexistent (pain: r = 0.16, CRP: r = 0.08, ESR: r = 0.02).

In the mixed-effects models, previous treatment with DMARDs (naive vs stable) was identical for all but 1 trial (trial 5) and could therefore not be disentangled from random study effects (Table 2). For all outcomes, baseline values showed a significant influence on the outcome at both weeks 12 and 24. No other variables tested had statistically significant effects, except for washout length, which had an unexpectedly high effect on both CRP level and ESR at week 24 only. This result could be biased: washout length was associated in this data set with earlier use of DMARDs, the only study with no previous use of DMARDs making up 61% of the group of patients with a shorter washout length.

### High C-reactive protein levels are related to better survival in patients with uveal melanoma [^116EfV8h]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

We hypothesized that systemic inflammation may also play a role in the prognosis of UM. Well-known markers of systemic inflammation are the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), NLR, LMR, and high numbers of peripheral blood leukocytes. The objectives of this study were to determine if patients with UM who have an increased risk of metastasis developing already have aberrant markers of inflammation at the time of treatment of the primary UM. We analyzed several of these markers under the hypothesis that an aberrant ESR, CRP, leukocyte count, LMR, or NLR could be an indication of systemic inflammation and specifically would occur in those who later demonstrate metastasis. To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze systemic inflammation markers in patients with UM. This may provide insight into the systemic changes at the time that metastases have not yet become clinically detectable.

### Reducing inappropriate ESR testing with computerized clinical decision support [^111Ba36b]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Design

We planned a series of interventions of increasing complexity, starting with an educational bulletin and moving to city-wide implementation of CDS. We used interrupted time series analysis to determine if our primary outcome, the number of ESR orders per week, was reduced by our interventions. Results were analyzed using statistical process control (SPC) charts (QI Macros and Microsoft Excel).

### Systematic review of the use of CRP in clinical trials for psoriatic arthritis: a concern for clinical practice? [^116eYrty]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

CRP and ESR are traditionally suggested as easy point-of-care laboratory markers of systemic inflammation to support diagnosis and measure disease activity in PsA. However, in PsA CRP levels have shown to not increase consistently with disease activity. Nevertheless, CRP is regularly used individually in RCTs as part of the evaluation of disease activity and as a prognostic factor for long-term outcomes. In addition, CRP is included in different composite measures for monitoring disease activity in PsA, like ACR-20, –50, −70 response, DAS-28 CRP, DAPSA, and PASDAS.

In the studied phase 3 studies with biologicals in PsA, CRP levels within the PsA study population tend to be very heterogeneous. In general, baseline CRP levels are lower in those studies without enrolment requirement criteria for CRP. Although CRP levels are often normal in PsA, one-third of the studies used CRP as a way of identifying active disease. Using CRP levels as inclusion criterion possibly reduces the representativeness of the study population for the global patient population. In the DISCOVER 2 study for example, which used CRP as an inclusion criterion, the randomised study population had a high average of swollen and tender joints along with substantial systemic inflammation. This may possibly reduce the applicability of conclusions to patients who, despite lower CRP levels, also suffer from active disease and clearly require therapy. Lack of awareness among non-experts about the limitations of generalisability in these specific clinical trials carries some risks for patient care: underestimation of disease severity in patients with normal CRP levels, too strict criteria for reimbursement of advanced therapies by third party private or governmental organisations.

### Systemic inflammation and intelligence in early adulthood and subsequent risk of schizophrenia and other non-affective psychoses: a longitudinal cohort and co-relative study [^115DAeHg]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Baseline characteristics

Of the total sample of 638 213 Swedish men, at baseline 470 923 (73.79%) had an ESR level of 0–3 mm/h, 112 089 (17.56%) of 4–6 mm/h, 35 023 (5.49%) of 7–10 mm/h, and 20 178 (3.16%) of ⩾11 mm/h. ESR groups differed significantly in age at conscription, migration status, winter birth, parental socioeconomic status, and household crowding (all p < 0.05; Table 1). In total, 5398 (0.85%) and 5133 (0.80%) individuals in this population-based sample developed schizophrenia or ONAP until follow-up, respectively.

Table 1.
Baseline characteristics of the sample

Associations between IQ, schizophrenia, and ONAP

With each one-point increase in IQ, risk decreased for schizophrenia (unadjusted HR = 0.963, 95% CI 0.961–0.964; adjusted HR = 0.961, 95% CI 0.960–0.963), and for ONAP (unadjusted HR = 0.974; 95% CI 0.972–0.976; adjusted HR = 0.973, 95% CI 0.971–0.975). Evidence for these associations remained after excluding individuals hospitalised within 2 years after conscription (online Supplementary Table 1).

Association between ESR and IQ

Higher ESR was associated with lower IQ at the time of conscription in a dose-response function (Table 2). When compared with ESR of 0–3 mm/h, there was a small but robust decrease in IQ for groups with higher ESR levels. After adjusting for potential confounders these associations attenuated, but remained significant. We explored whether the dose–response relationship observed using ESR as a categorical variable could be more parsimoniously explained using ESR as a continuous variable. Comparing these models using a log-likelihood test revealed no significant difference between two models (p = 0.62) suggesting that categorical classification of ESR is not superior to a linear description of the ESR-IQ association (online Supplementary Table 2).

### The erythrocyte sedimentation rate in male adolescents and subsequent risk of Parkinson's disease: an observational study [^1162dqbT]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

The ESR is a simple, non-specific screening test that indirectly measures the presence of inflammation in the body. It calculates the rate of sedimentation of red blood cells within a 200-mm vertical tube of anticoagulated blood. The process of erythrocyte sedimentation is largely influenced by the initial aggregation of red blood cells, which is facilitated by the presence of plasma proteins of high molecular weight. Thus, a high concentration of certain plasma proteins, e.g. fibrinogen and immunoglobulins, causes a high ESR. The blood concentration of fibrinogen, which is an acute phase reactant, is increased in inflammatory situations. It is important to note that the ESR may not correlate fully with the levels of other inflammatory biomarkers. Most studies that have addressed the association between the levels of inflammation and disease in patients with PD have defined inflammation using the plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Until we can identify people with PD earlier in the course of their disease, we will not be able to establish definitively whether inflammation is an etiologic factor or a resultant process in the pathophysiology of the disease.

It is possible that our results indicate that a high ESR protects against PD. Fibrinogen can activate microglia, and it has been debated whether microglial activation protects against or exacerbates neuronal loss. Microglia could increase neuronal survival through the release of trophic and anti-inflammatory factors. In PD, the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons is associated with microglial activation, which could be seen as an epiphenomenon rather than having a direct involvement in the pathogenesis of the disease. Moderately activated microglia appear to play a homeostatic role in the CNS and form the first line of defense against, for example, inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, by regulating immunological and inflammatory responses.

An alternative explanation is that individuals who later develop PD have a weaker ability to produce a high ESR. An unpublished study from our group shows that patients with PD have weaker antibody responses to Varicella Zoster Virus, as compared to age-matched controls. Additional indications of an altered immune response in PD are that patients with PD display reduced number of T-helper and B lymphocytes. Individuals with a reduced ability to produce antibodies should be more prone to infections. It has been shown that patients with PD have a higher infection burden.

### Clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with atherothrombotic risk factors presenting with low concentrations of highly sensitive C-reactive protein [^115TQAwK]. Atherosclerosis (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

To clarify whether individuals with low concentrations of highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) are free of atherothrombotic risk factors or low-grade inflammation.

Methods and Results

This cross-sectional study included 1266 individuals with risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, obesity). Eighty percent of women and the same percentage of men with a low concentration (0.8 ± 0.4 mg/l) of hs-CRP had at least one atherothrombotic risk factor. About one-fourth of the females and a one-third of the males with a low concentration of hs-CRP had at least one laboratory marker of chronic inflammation (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), white blood cell count (WBCC) or fibrinogen concentration) in the upper 75th percentile.

Conclusion

Individuals presenting with low concentrations of hs-CRP are not necessarily free of atherothrombotic risk factors. One-fourth of the females and a third of the males in this group presented laboratory evidence of a low-grade inflammation as detected by increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white blood cell count or fibrinogen concentration.

### 2015 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of native vertebral osteomyelitis in adults [^114zaFvN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Native vertebral osteomyelitis (NVO) follow-up — key clinical questions for outcome prediction and monitoring are outlined, including which factors such as demographics, microbiology, serum inflammatory markers, and imaging studies are useful in predicting outcomes. Additional questions ask how to manage patients with persistent elevation of inflammatory markers after a course of parenteral antimicrobial therapy and the utility of obtaining weekly follow-up inflammatory laboratory markers (ESR, CRP) while patients are receiving antimicrobial therapy for NVO.

### Simultaneous testing of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein: increased expenditure without demonstrable benefit [^116LpFSv]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

We analyzed the practice of paired erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein testing when evaluating fever or inflammation. In our hospital, this resulted in additional charges of $250000-$400000/year without demonstrable added benefit to patient care. Extrapolating our results, we estimate reducing this practice could save up to $300000000 nationally.

### C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate results reliably exclude invasive bacterial infections [^111cgrx8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinicians utilize inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), to identify febrile children who may have an occult serious illness or infection.

Objectives

Our objective was to determine the relationship between invasive bacterial infections (IBIs) and CRP and ESR in febrile children.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study of 1460 febrile children < 21 years of age, who presented to a single Emergency Department (ED) between 2012 and 2014 for evaluation of fever of < 14 days' duration, who had both CRP and ESR obtained. Our primary outcome was IBI, defined as growth of pathogenic bacteria from a culture of cerebrospinal fluid or blood. We reviewed all ED encounters that occurred within three days of the index visits for development of IBI. We examined the negative predictive value (NPV) of CRP and ESR for IBI.

Results

Of the 1460 eligible ED encounters, the median patient age was 5.3 years [interquartile range (IQR) 2.4–10.0 years] and 762 (50.4%) were hospitalized. The median duration of fever was 4 days (IQR 1–7 days). Overall, 20 had an IBI (20/1460; 1.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9–2.1%). None of those with a normal CRP (NPV 273/273; 100%, 95% CI 98.6–100%) or a normal ESR (NPV 486/486; 100%, 95% CI 99.2–100%) had an IBI.

Conclusions

In our cross-sectional study of febrile children, IBI was unlikely with either a normal CRP or ESR. Inflammatory markers could be used to assist clinical decision-making while awaiting results of bacterial cultures.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^115mBWHo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Osteomyelitis — diagnostic evaluation is typically based on clinical suspicion with confirmation by imaging and laboratory methods, and inflammatory markers are often elevated: the peripheral white blood cell count may be elevated; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are often elevated as well. Establishing an etiologic diagnosis nearly always requires obtaining bone for microbiologic evaluation unless blood cultures are positive in the context of convincing radiographic findings, which can be accomplished by imaging-guided or surgical sampling. As much specimen as possible should be submitted to the laboratory; specimens may include pieces of intact bone, shavings, scrapings, and/or excised or aspirated necrotic material. Swabs are not recommended and cultures of sinus tracts are generally not recommended, because recovered organisms, aside from Staphylococcus aureus, do not correlate well with those found in deep cultures. In adults, imaging-guided aspiration or open biopsy is typically necessary, and those with underlying diabetes mellitus or vascular insufficiency are at particular risk for osteomyelitis.

### Promoting appropriate utilisation of laboratory tests for inflammation at an academic medical centre [^114c3ror]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Problem

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or sed rate) and C reactive protein (CRP) are commonly used tests in clinical practice to evaluate for inflammation. CRP has been shown to be a more sensitive and specific test when assessing acute phase inflammation. Recommendations from the American Society for Clinical Pathology, as part of the Choosing Wisely campaign, state ' Don't order an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) to look for inflammation in patients with undiagnosed conditions. Order a C-reactive protein (CRP) to detect acute phase inflammation '.

The initiative was conducted at a 562-bed, level 1 trauma, academic medical centre in New England. We observed high rates of ESR and combined ESR/CRP testing at our medical centre, leading to concerns about potential overuse of ESR. We speculated that combined, simultaneous ESR and CRP orders were rarely indicated and could provide a marker of unnecessary tests, since CRP is preferred for detecting acute inflammation in undiagnosed conditions, whereas ESR may be preferred for monitoring disease activity in some specific inflammatory conditions. We surmised that lack of knowledge regarding the test characteristics of ESR and CRP, ordering habits and the design of order entry within the electronic medical record (EMR) contributed to overuse of ESR testing. We hypothesised that interventions targeting specific drivers identified at our institution would decrease unnecessary ESR testing, improve clinical appropriateness of ESR testing and effect institutional cost savings.

We sought to understand the drivers for ESR use, reduce unnecessary ESR testing, assess changes in clinician ordering practices and estimate the impact on the costs of care delivery. Specifically, we aimed to reduce the total number of ESR tests per month and the number of combined ESR and CRP tests per month by 50% within 12 months of initiating the project. We also aimed to improve the clinical appropriateness of ESR ordering so that testing was used for specific inflammatory conditions rather than for acute phase inflammation in undiagnosed conditions.

### Are poor prognostic factors a realistic basis for treatment decisions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis? Lessons from the IMPROVED study [^11697zU5]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) recommendations for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) recommend the use of poor prognostic factors (PPFs) in treatment decisions.PPFs are: (1) persistent moderate/high disease activity after conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), (2) high C reactive protein (CRP)/erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels at baseline, (3) high swollen joint counts (SJC) at baseline, (4) presence of Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and/or Anti-Citrullinated Protein Antibodies (ACPA), especially at high levels, (5) presence of early erosions or (6) failure of two or more csDMARDs.PPFs are associated with an increased risk of radiographic damage over time. It is recommended, if a treatment target is not achieved with the first csDMARD strategy, to treat patients without PPFs with a second csDMARD, but to switch to treatment with a biological DMARD (bDMARD) if PPFs are present. These considerations are based on expert opinion, and an investigation into the association between stratification and treatment outcomes is recommended. We aim to explore the presence of PPFs in early RA and to investigate their relationship with treatment response after failure of the first csDMARD strategy.

### Reducing inappropriate ESR testing with computerized clinical decision support [^112DbKBQ]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Problem

Unnecessary lab tests increase health care costs, lead to unwarranted investigations, and may negatively impact patient outcomes. The American Society of Clinical Pathology, in its Choosing Wisely Campaign, suggests inflammation be investigated with C-reactive protein (CRP) instead of Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR). London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC), a tertiary-care hospital organization in Ontario, Canada, targeted ESR for a pilot project to reduce test overutilization. LHSC is an urban, acute-care hospital with over one million patient visits per year. The division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine (PaLM) runs over seven million laboratory tests annually with an operating budget of $55 million CAD. The PaLM test utilization committee was created to develop strategies for reducing unnecessary laboratory testing. The team consisted of physicians and medical laboratory technologists, including the coordinator for hematology and the chair of the hematology division. The committee set a goal for this quality improvement (QI) initiative to reduce inappropriate ESR orders by 50%.

### Is treatment in patients with suspected nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis effective? Six-month results of a placebo-controlled trial [^116TSpk6]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy of 16-week treatment with etanercept (ETN) in patients with suspected nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (SpA).

Methods

Tumor necrosis factor inhibitor-naive patients with inflammatory back pain with at least 2 SpA features and high disease activity (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index score ≥ 4), without the requirement of a positive finding on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sacroiliac (SI) joint and/or elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level, were randomized (1:1) to receive ETN (n = 40) or placebo (n = 40) for 16 weeks and subsequently were followed up for a further 8 weeks (to 24 weeks from baseline) without study medication. The primary end point was the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society 20 (ASAS20) response at 16 weeks. Secondary end points included the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) and changes in disease parameters, including the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI), CRP level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada index scores (MRI of the SI joint), after 16 and 24 weeks.

Results

Patient characteristics at baseline were comparable between the ETN and placebo groups. At 16 weeks, there was no significant difference in the percentage of patients exhibiting ASAS20 response between the ETN group (6 patients [16.7%]) and the placebo group (4 patients [11.1%]) (relative risk 0.7 [95% confidence interval 0.2–2.2], P = 0.5). Only the ESR showed more improvement in the ETN group compared to the placebo group at 16 weeks (decreases of 2.2 mm/hour and 1.4 mm/hour, respectively), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Between 16 and 24 weeks, without study medication, the BASMI, CRP level, and ESR had worsened to a greater extent in the ETN group compared to the placebo group, with the difference being significant for the CRP level.

Conclusion

This study shows that in patients with suspected nonradiographic axial SpA with high disease activity but without the requirement of a positive finding on SI joint MRI and/or elevated CRP level, treatment with ETN is not effective.

### Sixth-month remission as a predictor for twelve-month remission in polymyalgia rheumatica [^111abyWJ]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate clinical and laboratory prognostic factors of remission after one year of follow-up in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) treated with low-dose prednisone.

Methods

In this observational study, in a monocentric Italian Rheumatology Unit, we enrolled eighty-one consecutive PMR patients. Clinical and laboratory tests were performed every 3 months. Clinical remission was defined as the lack of symptoms, while laboratory remission was defined as erythrocyte sedimentation rate ≤ 40 mm/h and C-reactive protein (CRP) ≤ 0.5 mg/dl.

Results

Thirty-eight patients reached complete (clinical and laboratory) remission after 12 months of follow-up. A significant lower percentage of complete remission was seen in female gender compared to male (33.9% vs. 78.2%, p = 0.0001) at univariate analysis. No significant differences were found at baseline according to response to therapy during follow-up, while CRP values at the sixth month were significantly lower in patients who reached complete remission after one year (median: 0.4 mg/dl vs. 1 mg/dl, p = 0.017). CRP < 0.5 mg/dl at 6 months was independently associated with complete remission at 12 months in the multivariate analysis.

Conclusions

The sixth month of therapy is a target for the management of PMR because it can help to identify patients at greater risk of exacerbations, who may benefit from a tighter follow-up and more aggressive therapeutic strategy. Higher CRP values at 6 months appear to be associated with a higher risk of longer steroid therapy.

### Medical imaging in personalised medicine: a white paper of the research committee of the European Society of Radiology (ESR) [^115Djtnz]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Imaging in personalised prevention

Many common diseases have a long subclinical history before they become clinically evident. Biomedical imaging allows for the non-invasive assessment of in vivo structural and functional changes that may reflect specific pathologies. This makes it possible to investigate specific pathophysiological substrates of disease in the pre-symptomatic phase and at the population level. Screening a clinically healthy population with imaging to detect and characterise these subclinical abnormalities and to treat the individuals at risk might be an optimal strategy in preventive medicine. Personalised prevention with imaging will result in detection and treatment at the right time and in stratification of the main group into subgroups with low, intermediate and high risk of developing disease. Each group might have its own treatment regime, ranging from discharge, regular follow-up at several years, watchful waiting with an imaging follow-up after several months, or a medical or surgical intervention.

Baseline characteristics of the study subjects according to ESR

SD standard deviation, BMI body mass index, BP blood pressure, PD Parkinson´s disease, ESR erythrocyte sedimentation rate, EVF erythrocyte volume fraction

Individuals with higher ESRs were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with PD, as ESR was inversely associated with risk of PD. The hazard ratio (HR) for PD with basic adjustments (age at conscription, year of conscription, test center and EVF) was 0.94 (P = 0.02, 95% CI 0.89–0.99) per log 2 increase in ESR, corresponding to a two-fold increase in ESR (Table 2). Further adjustments for potential confounders (parental education, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and IQ) resulted in very small changes to the HR. In addition, ESR was modeled as a restricted cubic spline (Fig. 2). The association between ESR and PD risk was similar for increases in ESR up to 15 mm/h, leveled off for ESRs > 15 mm/h, and became non-significant at ESR values > 20 mm/h.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2021 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in pediatrics [^112kWQPn]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) — C-reactive protein (CRP) diagnostic performance: Reported sensitivity includes a pooled sensitivity of CRP of 80.5% (ranging from 79.5% in one cohort, which included culture-negative osteomyelitis, and up to 100% in patients presenting with concomitant septic arthritis) and a range of sensitivity of 72% to 89%, with a lower sensitivity of 47% in a series of children with AHO of the calcaneus. The review identified 6 published studies from 2005 to 2019 and collectively these studies indicate very limited value for CRP as a diagnostic test for AHO in children; numeric cutoffs varied and none established a definite CRP value above which the diagnosis of osteomyelitis should be suspected, and AUC data showed low accuracy. One study evaluated 259 patients with both CRP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and a retrospective emergency department cohort including 17 children with orthopedic infection and 242 with other etiologies (prevalence of infection of 6.6%) reported a negative predictive value of 97% after deleting the optimal cutoff from the dataset (cutoff presumed at 7 mg/dL or 70 mg/L). Additional observational data show that 62% to 98% of children with culture-positive osteomyelitis have an elevated CRP on admission, the AUC for CRP in prediction of bacteremia in two studies were 0.59 and 0.75 (CRP cutoff of 4.25 mg/ dL or 42.5 mg/L), and CRP values are higher on average in children with bacteremia compared with those without bacteremia.

### Tocilizumab-aazg (Tyenne) [^1122c7Xe]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.3 Giant Cell Arteritis – Subcutaneous Administration

The efficacy and safety of subcutaneously administered tocilizumab was assessed in a single, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study in patients with active GCA. In Study WA28119 (NCT01791153), 251 screened patients with new-onset or relapsing GCA were randomized to one of four treatment arms. Two subcutaneous doses of tocilizumab (162 mg every week and 162 mg every other week) were compared to two different placebo control groups (pre-specified prednisone-taper regimen over 26 weeks and 52 weeks) randomized 2:1:1:1. The study consisted of a 52-week blinded period, followed by a 104-week open-label extension.

All patients received background glucocorticoid (prednisone) therapy. Each of the tocilizumab-treated groups and one of the placebo-treated groups followed a pre-specified prednisone-taper regimen with the aim to reach 0 mg by 26 weeks, while the second placebo-treated group followed a pre-specified prednisone-taper regimen with the aim to reach 0 mg by 52 weeks designed to be more in keeping with standard practice.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving sustained remission from Week 12 through Week 52. Sustained remission was defined by a patient attaining a sustained (1) absence of GCA signs and symptoms from Week 12 through Week 52, (2) normalization of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (to < 30 mm/hr without an elevation to ≥ 30 mm/hr attributable to GCA) from Week 12 through Week 52, (3) normalization of C-reactive protein (CRP) (to < 1 mg/dL, with an absence of successive elevations to ≥ 1mg/dL) from Week 12 through Week 52, and (4) successful adherence to the prednisone taper defined by not more than 100 mg of excess prednisone from Week 12 through Week 52. Tocilizumab 162 mg weekly and 162 mg every other week + 26 weeks prednisone taper both showed superiority in achieving sustained remission from Week 12 through Week 52 compared with placebo + 26 weeks prednisone taper (Table 8). Both tocilizumab treatment arms also showed superiority compared to the placebo + 52 weeks prednisone taper (Table 8).

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^114yRJj9]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis etiology assessment — hormone ratios and thyroiditis features indicate that in one study the ratio of total T3 to total T4 (ng/μg) was > 20 in GD and toxic nodular goiter, and < 20 in painless or postpartum thyroiditis, and in factitious ingestion due to exogenous levothyroxine a low serum thyroglobulin level, a near-zero RAIU, and a T3 to T4 (ng/μg) ratio < 20 can distinguish this cause. Subacute thyroiditis is generally painful with a firm to hard gland and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is usually > 50 mm/h and sometimes over 100 mm/h. When antithyroglobulin antibodies prevent thyroglobulin measurement, rectal T4 has been reported with mean values of 1.03 nmol/g in euthyroid patients, 1.93 nmol/g in Graves' hyperthyroidism, and 12–24 nmol/g in factitious thyrotoxicosis.

Reduced kidney function: (1) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60mL/min/1.73m(2) and (2) eGFR < 45mL/min/1.73m(2) on 2 consecutive occasions at least 90 days apart; cardiovascular disease (CVD); and death.

Measurements

The cumulative incidence of reduced kidney function was estimated adjusting for the competing risk of death.

Results

Of 813 patients with RA and 813 non-RA individuals, mean age was 56 ± 16 (SD) years, 68% were women, and 9% had reduced kidney function at baseline. The 20-year cumulative incidence of reduced kidney function was higher in patients with RA compared with non-RA participants for eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73m(2) (25% vs 20%; P = 0.03), but not eGFR < 45mL/min/1.73m(2) (9% vs 10%; P = 0.8). The presence of CVD at baseline (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.14–2.73; P = 0.01) and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate in patients with RA (HR per 10-mm/h increase, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.00–1.16; P = 0.04) was associated with increased risk of eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73m(2). eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73m(2) was not associated with increased risk of CVD development in patients with RA (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.63–1.57; P = 0.9), however, a greater reduction in GFR (eGFR < 45mL/min/1.73m(2)) was associated with increased risk of CVD (HR, 1.93; CI, 1.04–3.58; P = 0.04).

Limitations

Reduced kidney function was defined by estimating equations for kidney function. We are limited to deriving associations from our findings.

Conclusions

Patients with RA were more likely to develop reduced kidney function over time. CVD and associated factors appear to play a role. The presence of RA in individuals with reduced kidney function may lead to an increase in morbidity from CVD development, for which awareness may provide a means for optimizing care.

### ESR essentials: advanced MR safety in vulnerable patients-practice recommendations by the European society for magnetic resonance in medicine and biology [^116fkg8f]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patient summary

Magnetic resonance imaging is a safe procedure when performed within the appropriate safety boundaries, however it is not free of potential risks. In some patient categories, which are less commonly encountered in daily practices, these risk factors are heightened, and special care needs to be taken when evaluating the correct procedure to perform, to minimize the risks and maximize the benefit to the patient.

### Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, or rheumatoid factor are normal at presentation in 35%-45% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis seen between 1980 and 2004: analyses from Finland and the United States [^116Xxihg]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and rheumatoid factor (RF) tests in 2 databases of consecutive patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) over 25 years between 1980 and 2004, in Finland and the United States.

Methods

Databases of 1892 patients of 7 rheumatologists in Jyväskylä, Finland, and 478 of one author in Nashville, TN, USA, seen in usual care, were reviewed for the first recorded ESR and CRP, and all RF tests.

Results

Median ESR at presentation was 30 mm/h at both sites. Mean ESR was 36 mm/h in Jyväskylä and 35 mm/h in Nashville. ESR was < 28 mm/h in 45% and 47% of patients at the 2 sites, respectively. CRP was normal in 44% and 58%, and all RF tests were negative in 38% and 37%, respectively. Both ESR and CRP were normal in 33% and 42% of patients, and all 3 tests were normal in 15% and 14% of patients in whom they were assessed. All 3 tests were abnormal in only 28% in Jyväskylä and 23% in Nashville.

Conclusion

A majority of patients with RA seen between 1980 and 2004 had abnormal ESR, CRP, or RF. However, more than 37% of patients had ESR < 28 mm/h, normal CRP, or all negative RF tests. Similarities of laboratory test data at 2 sites on different continents with different duration of disease suggest generalizability of the findings. Normal ESR, CRP, and RF are seen in a substantial proportion of patients with RA at this time.

### Modifications of metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors after weight loss induced by laparoscopic gastric banding [^115dk62j]. Obesity Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The well-known inverse relation between life expectancy and BMI, particularly in morbid obesity, is presumably in large part due to multiple cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities. Severely obese patients treated with laparoscopic adjustable silicone gastric banding (LASGB) were evaluated for such risk factors before and 1 year after LASGB.

Methods

130 individuals (age 20–66, BMI 34–59 kg/m2) who underwent LASGB between 1996 and 2000 were studied; 50 of them were available for reevaluation 12 months after surgery. The presence and severity of diabetes (DM), hypertension (HTN), hypercholesterolemia (HC) and hypertriglyceridemia (HT) were assessed before and after surgery. In 18 of them erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were also measured.

Results

Comorbidities were highly prevalent at the initial evaluation: DM 10%, HTN 32%, HC 37%, HT 27%. In the subgroup reevaluated after surgery, prevalence of DM decreased from 15% to 6%, HTN from 37% to 25%, HC from 36% to 25%, and HT from 29% to 13%, with an average BMI loss from 44.1 to 35.9. ESR decreased from a preoperative value of 36.7 ± 22.6 mm/hr to 18.3 ± 11.9 mm/hr at 1 year (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Morbidly obese subjects respond to LASGB with an impressive reduction of comorbidities which is sustained for at least 1 year, well after the initial acute negative energy balance and when weight tends to stabilize. The high prevalence of elevated ESR, which has been considered a strong predictor of coronary mortality, confirms previous reports of its association with obesity, and the clear tendency to normalization with weight loss may represent a further element contributing to lower morbidity.

### Gemcitabine-induced respiratory failure associated with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) [^1139q2nA]. Respiratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Gemcitabine is a newer pyrimidine analog used for the treatment of solid tumors. Though generally considered safe, it can cause pulmonary toxicity, which is generally mild and reversible. The purpose of this publication is to document a case of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by Gemcitabine administration. The patient was noticed to have the extreme elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (> 100 mm/h) at the time of diagnosis. We observed excellent response to the corticosteroids. The ESR trended back to normal after the resolution of her symptoms thereby suggesting the utility of monitoring ESR in the diagnosis and management of Gemcitabine-induced pulmonary toxicity.

### Predictive value of inflammatory markers for cancer diagnosis in primary care: a prospective cohort study using electronic health records [^1111sTtM]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Index tests

Three inflammatory marker tests were analysed: CRP, ESR and PV. The index date was defined as the first date of inflammatory marker blood testing in 2014; controls were allocated the same index date as their matched case. As different laboratories use different thresholds to define abnormality, we used the mean upper limit of normal from laboratories within our study to define a raised inflammatory marker. For CRP this mean was 6.8 mg/l, therefore we rounded to a conservative threshold of 7 mg/l. For PV the upper limit of normal was 1.72 mPa.s. For ESR, we used the mean reported upper limit of normal, stratified by gender and in 10-year age bands, which varied from 11 mm/h for women under 40, to 23 mm/h for men over 80 (see supplementary table 1). For those with the same inflammatory marker test coded more than once on the same day (n = 231), the highest value was retained. For patients with more than one type of inflammatory marker on the same day a binary variable was generated for 'any raised inflammatory marker', which was positive if any of CRP, PV or ESR were raised.

Outcome variables

The primary outcome was the one-year cancer incidence; we also examined two-year incidence, lest there be a delayed effect. All new cancer diagnoses, excluding benign and in situ cancers and non-melanomatous skin cancers, were identified by searching the CPRD records for any of the 2120 cancer-related codes (available from the authors on request). This code list has been developed using published methodsand validated in several studies: it is collated into 22 common cancer sites. New cancer diagnoses were also extracted from the cancer registry by CPRD staff. Patients were included as having cancer if a diagnosis was recorded in either CPRD or the cancer registry, with the earliest record of cancer assigned to be the date of diagnosis.

In order to identify the main symptoms associated with inflammatory marker testing, we searched the CPRD for codes in the 28 days prior to and including the index date. We retained the 200 most frequently occurring codes in those with raised inflammatory markers, normal inflammatory markers and untested controls. After removing non-clinical administrative codes we used frequency counts to identify the most commonly occurring symptoms, categorised according to the International Classification of Primary Care. We then used methods described previouslyto generate complete code lists for each of these symptoms.

### Model-based meta-analysis compares DAS28 rheumatoid arthritis treatment effects and suggests an expedited trial design for early clinical development [^116eczuz]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation, autoantibody production, and progressive joint damage. 1 Multiple clinical indexes are available to evaluate RA disease activity, including the 28‐joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28). 2 DAS28 is a continuous measure of disease activity and typically exhibits a normal distribution in populations with RA. 3 DAS28 integrates measures of physical examination (tender and swollen joint counts), acute‐phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C‐reactive protein (CRP)), and patient self‐assessed global health; the combination of these variables into a single score may more comprehensively capture disease severity than the individual variables. 4, 5 Two additional advantages of the DAS28 include (i) its clinical diagnostic utility, meaning that scores can be readily interpreted to reflect disease activity categories (i.e. remission (< 2.6) and low (≥ 2.6 to < 3.2), moderate (≥ 3.2 to ≤ 5.1), or high (> 5.1) disease activity), and (ii) its high sensitivity to detect small changes in disease severity. 6, 7 Such high sensitivity to changes in disease activity has led to increased adoption of DAS28 in clinical practice and for regulatory agencies to assess its efficacy over the dichotomous American College of Rheumatology (ACR) score. 8, 9, 10 The high sensitivity of DAS28 makes it particularly useful in the design of smaller clinical trials, typically early in development, where large sample sizes are less feasible. 11

### Prognostic value of erythrocyte sedimentation rate in ST segment elevation myocardial infarction: interaction with hyperglycaemia [^1138NTAd]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Many inflammatory markers are associated with an adverse prognosis after ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Hyperglycaemia may exacerbate this inflammatory response. We investigated whether the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was associated with an adverse prognosis and whether this was mediated by glucose levels.

Research Design and Methods

It concerns a post hoc analysis of a prospective randomised trial. In 346 patients with STEMI treated with reperfusion therapy, we investigated long-term outcome. Patients with ESR in the upper quartile (> 14 mm h(-1)) were compared to patients with a normal ESR. Hyperglycaemia was defined as admission glucose ≥ 7.8 mmol L(-1). Median follow up was 7.4 years (range: 5.7–8.3).

Main Outcome Measures

All cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, sudden death, death as a result of heart failure.

Results

Both elevated ESR and hyperglycaemia were associated with a worse prognosis and increased mortality. Elevated ESR was particularly associated with an increased risk of sudden death (OR: 3.3, 17% vs. 6%, P < 0.01) whereas hyperglycaemia was especially associated with an increased risk of death because of heart failure (OR: 6.5, 8% vs. 1%, P < 0.01). There was no association between increased ESR and elevated glucose levels. Multivariate analysis did reveal that both elevated ESR and admission glucose were independent predictors of long-term mortality.

Conclusions

Elevated ESR and admission glucose are independent predictors of mortality in STEMI patients treated with reperfusion therapy. There is no association or interaction between glucose levels and the inflammatory response as reflected by ESR.

### Tocilizumab (Actemra) [^114vjRyv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.3 Giant Cell Arteritis – Subcutaneous Administration

The efficacy and safety of subcutaneously administered ACTEMRA was assessed in a single, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study in patients with active GCA. In Study WA28119 (NCT01791153), 251 screened patients with new-onset or relapsing GCA were randomized to one of four treatment arms. Two subcutaneous doses of ACTEMRA (162 mg every week and 162 mg every other week) were compared to two different placebo control groups (pre-specified prednisone-taper regimen over 26 weeks and 52 weeks) randomized 2:1:1:1. The study consisted of a 52-week blinded period, followed by a 104-week open-label extension.

All patients received background glucocorticoid (prednisone) therapy. Each of the ACTEMRA-treated groups and one of the placebo-treated groups followed a pre-specified prednisone-taper regimen with the aim to reach 0 mg by 26 weeks, while the second placebo-treated group followed a pre-specified prednisone-taper regimen with the aim to reach 0 mg by 52 weeks designed to be more in keeping with standard practice.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving sustained remission from Week 12 through Week 52. Sustained remission was defined by a patient attaining a sustained (1) absence of GCA signs and symptoms from Week 12 through Week 52, (2) normalization of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (to < 30 mm/hr without an elevation to ≥ 30 mm/hr attributable to GCA) from Week 12 through Week 52, (3) normalization of C-reactive protein (CRP) (to < 1 mg/dL, with an absence of successive elevations to ≥ 1mg/dL) from Week 12 through Week 52, and (4) successful adherence to the prednisone taper defined by not more than 100 mg of excess prednisone from Week 12 through Week 52. ACTEMRA 162 mg weekly and 162 mg every other week + 26 weeks prednisone taper both showed superiority in achieving sustained remission from Week 12 through Week 52 compared with placebo + 26 weeks prednisone taper (Table 9). Both ACTEMRA treatment arms also showed superiority compared to the placebo + 52 weeks prednisone taper (Table 9).

### Chronic non bacterial osteitis-a multicentre study [^114qvy9y]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Data were collected on 131 children from 8 paediatric centres. This included 4 tertiary centres (Bristol, Liverpool, Edinburgh, and Glasgow) and also District General Hospitals within the Scottish SPARN network.

Demographics

94/131 (71.8%) were female. The median age at onset of symptoms was 9.5 years (IQR 8 to 11 years) median age at diagnosis was 10.7 years (IQR 8.9 to 12.7 years). The median time to diagnosis was 12 months (IQR 5 to 24 months). Other baseline characteristics are summarised in Table 1. The youngest patient was 23 months old.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of patients with CNO

Investigations

Laboratory investigations revealed a raised ESR (range < 1 to 148 mm/hr) or CRP (range < 1 to 400 mg/L) in 50/126 (39.68%) of the patients. ESR was mildly elevated (< 50 mm/hr) in 32/42(76.1%), moderately elevated (50 to 100 mm/hr) in 8/42(19.04%) and highly elevated (> 100 mm/hr) in 2/42(4.75%). CRP was mildly elevated (< 50 mg/L) in 16/28(57.14%), moderately elevated (50 to 100 mg/L) in 8/28(28.6%) and highly elevated (> 100 mg/L) in 4/28(14.28%). Both ESR and CRP were raised in 20 patients and 11 had proportionate elevation of both. One patient had unusually high inflammatory markers (CRP = 400, ESR = 100) at time of presentation associated with fevers and widespread joint pain. The diagnosis of CNO was made after negative tests for infection, typical features of CNO on extensive imaging (X rays, bone scan, CT and MRI), inadequate response to antibiotics and, in contrast, an immediate and sustained response to bisphosphonate treatment.

### Distinguishing active pediatric COVID-19 pneumonia from MIS-C [^113hUAHA]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Laboratory findings

Creatinine levels on admission were similar between the groups, suggestive of no significant difference in the number of patients with acute kidney injury at presentation, as defined by normal ranges for age and gender (Table 3). MIS-C patients were noted to have significantly lower sodium levels on admission than COVID-19 patients, and finding that consistent with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), as hyponatremia has been previously reported in the disease as well. Albumin, transaminase, brain natriuretic peptide, and troponin levels were similar in COVID-19 and MIS-C patients.

Table 3
Laboratory and echocardiography results

Inflammatory markers on admission differed significantly between all groups. Median initial C-reactive protein (CRP) was 4.6 mg/dL (IQR 1.4–11.1) in total COVID-19 patients compared to 15.9 mg/dL (IQR 11.2–23.1) in total MIS-C patients. This significant difference was also seen between median values of 9.2 mg/dL (IQR 1.4–11.9) in severe COVID-19 patients and 17.7 mg/dL (IQR 12–27.6) in severe MIS-C patients. Erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESR) on admission were also different between groups, with an initial median value of 25 mm/hr. (IQR 9–40) in total COVID-19 patients, compared to 48 mm/hr. (IQR 38–58) in total MIS-C patients, and 19 mm/hr. (IQR 12.5–35) in severe COVID-19 patients versus 41 mm/hr. (IQR 38–58) in severe MIS-C patients. Lower values in severe disease is consistent with coagulopathy often seen in MAS. There was a significant difference between median procalcitonin levels on admission between total COVID-19 (0.8 ng/mL (IQR 0.4–2.6)) and total MIS-C patients (11.5 ng/mL (IQR 4.3–24.4)) (p = 0.0004) and among the severe COVID-19 (1.3 ng/mL (IQR 0.8–2.6)) and severe MIS-C patients (13.5 ng/mL (IQR 8.4–32)) (p = 0.0013).

### Laboratory markers in IBD: useful, magic, or unnecessary toys? [^115oZRct]. Gut (2006). Low credibility.

Laboratory markers have been investigated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) for diagnostic and differential diagnostic purposes, for assessment of disease activity and risk of complications, for prediction of relapse, and for monitoring the effect of therapy. The introduction of biological therapies in IBD has renewed interest in inflammatory markers (especially C reactive protein (CRP)), given their potential to select responders to these treatments. Of all the laboratory markers, CRP is the most studied and has been shown to have the best overall performance. CRP is an objective marker of inflammation and correlates well with disease activity in Crohn's disease (CD). Increased CRP levels are associated with better response rates and normal CRP levels predict high placebo response rates in clinical trials with biologicals. However, despite the advantages of CRP over other markers, it is still far from ideal. Furthermore, CRP correlates less well with disease activity in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) as compared with CD. Other laboratory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), leucocyte and platelet count, albumin, and 1 acid glycoprotein (orosomucoid), have been studied either less extensively in IBD or have proven to be less useful than CRP. Faecal markers seem promising and may be more specific in detecting gut inflammation in patients with established IBD. Promising results have been reported with the use of faecal calprotectin in CD as well as in UC. Recent data however suggest that the performance of the faecal calprotectin test is superior for UC than for CD. Taken together, laboratory markers are useful and should be part of the global management of our IBD patients. They are however not magic and until more data become available, the use of CRP and other laboratory markers should be seen as an additive tool to clinical observation and physical examination rather than a replacement.

### DAS28-CRP and DAS28-ESR cut-offs for high disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis are not interchangeable [^116gfaAT]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Since the difference between baseline DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP in this analysis is similar to other clinical trials, the new HDA definition may be applicable across various populations. However, this cut-off needs to be validated in longitudinal or registry cohorts. Additionally, it is possible that minor differences may occur in the cut-off value, depending on the laboratory and also on whether traditional CRP or hs-CRP is used. This analysis included only one study that used traditional CRP and one that used hs-CRP; therefore, we were not able to closely evaluate the potential for differences.

In summary, we recommend the use of a new HDA definition of > 4.6 when using DAS28-CRP, since this is comparable to the validated DAS28-ESR HDA cut-off of > 5.1. The new HDA definition should be used alongside the previously reported thresholds for DAS28-CRP of ≤ 2.9 for LDA and < 2.4 for remission. This will enable more accurate measurement of disease activity when the DAS28-CRP is used. It is essential that clinicians, clinical triallists, payers and regulatory agencies clearly specify which type of DAS28 score is being used and avoid using them interchangeably.

### Wegener's granulomatosis presents as pulmonary infection… [^114VjKhX]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

to the editor: A 35-year-old man with relapsing infections of the upper respiratory tract and nasal bleeding for five months was admitted to our hospital. The patient had been discharged from another hospital after showing no clinical improvement from one month of antibacterial and antituberculous treatment, and refusing to undergo lung operation for the postulated diagnosis of pulmonary abscess. Physical examination on admission to our hospital showed fever as high as 38. 8° C, pulse of 80 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 120/70 mm Hg. The only abnormal findings on physical examination were small blood clots in the nose and ronchi in the upper right lung field. Laboratory tests revealed the following: white blood cell count of 13, 230 per mm. 3; hematocrit level, 36. 3 percent; hemoglobulin level,
11. 4 g per dL; platelet count, 588, 000.

per mm 3; C-reactive protein
21. 74 mg per dL; and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 105 mm per first hour. Laboratory tests for renal function, including urinalysis, were normal. Chest radiography and computed tomography of the thorax showed a large infiltrate with a central cavitation in the right upper pulmonary field. Craniofacial CT revealed ethmoid sinusitis. The diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis was suggested by a significantly increased titer of the cytoplasmic-type antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody of 65. 3 u, and was confirmed by histopathologic examination of excised nasal mucosal specimens. The patient received treatment with cyclophosphamide, prednisolone, and cotrimoxazole, which improved symptoms and laboratory test abnormalities.

When fever persists in a patient with a significantly high ESR value, and radiographic and CT findings reveal sinusitis or a large pulmonary infiltrate with a central cavitation, Wegener's granulomatosis must be considered.
