51. If the sum of the interior angles of $m$ regular $n$-sided polygons can be divided by 27, then the minimum value of $m+n$ is

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the minimum value of m + n such that the sum of the interior angles of m regular n-sided polygons is divisible by 27. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formula for the sum of interior angles of a single regular polygon. Then, I should generalize that to m polygons and set up the divisibility condition. Next, I will simplify the expression and identify the key constraint on n. After that, I should find the smallest valid n and the corresponding smallest m that satisfies the divisibility, and finally compute m + n and verify the result.

> Let me first confirm the formula for the interior angle sum of a regular polygon. The sum of interior angles of a single regular n-gon is (n − 2) × 180 degrees, so for m such polygons the total sum is m × (n − 2) × 180 degrees [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the divisibility requirement. We need m × (n − 2) × 180 to be divisible by 27. I can write this as m × (n − 2) × 180 ≡ 0 mod 27, which simplifies to m × (n − 2) × 20 ≡ 0 mod 3 after dividing numerator and denominator by 9, since 180 ÷ 9 = 20 and 27 ÷ 9 = 3 [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the simplification. 180 divided by 9 is indeed 20, and 27 divided by 9 is 3, so the congruence m × (n − 2) × 20 ≡ 0 mod 3 is correct. Because 20 and 3 are coprime, this further reduces to m × (n − 2) ≡ 0 mod 3, meaning either m ≡ 0 mod 3 or n ≡ 2 mod 3 [^notfound].

> I will now examine the two cases. Case 1: m is a multiple of 3, in which case n can be any integer greater than or equal to 3. Case 2: n ≡ 2 mod 3, in which case m can be any positive integer. The minimum m + n will come from balancing small values of m and n across these cases, so I should test small n and small m accordingly [^notfound].

> Let me consider small values of n and check the congruence. If n = 3, then n ≡ 0 mod 3, so we need m ≡ 0 mod 3; the smallest m is 3, giving m + n = 6. If n = 4, then n ≡ 1 mod 3, so again m ≡ 0 mod 3; the smallest m is 3, giving m + n = 7. If n = 5, then n ≡ 2 mod 3, so m can be 1; this gives m + n = 6, which ties the n = 3 case. If n = 6, then n ≡ 0 mod 3, so m ≡ 0 mod 3; the smallest m is 3, giving m + n = 9. If n = 8, then n ≡ 2 mod 3, so m can be 1, giving m + n = 9. So far, the smallest candidate is 6, achieved by (m, n) = (3, 3) or (1, 5) [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought n = 2 might be valid, but that would not make sense for a polygon. I should confirm that n must be at least 3, which it must, so n = 2 is excluded. Thus, the smallest feasible n is 3, and the smallest m depends on the case as above [^notfound].

> Next, I should review whether any smaller m + n is possible. With n = 3 and m = 3, the total angle sum is 3 × (3 − 2) × 180 = 540, and 540 ÷ 27 = 20, which is an integer, so 540 is divisible by 27. With n = 5 and m = 1, the total is 1 × (5 − 2) × 180 = 540, which is again divisible by 27. Both combinations yield m + n = 6, and I cannot find a valid pair with m + n less than 6, so 6 appears to be the minimum.

> Final answer: The minimum value of m + n is 6, achieved when (m, n) is either (3, 3) or (1, 5) [^notfound].

---

The minimum value of (m + n) is **6**, achieved when (m = 1) and (n = 5). This is because the sum of interior angles of (m) regular (n)-gons is (m(n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ), and for divisibility by 27, (m(n - 2)) must be divisible by 3. The smallest solution is (m = 1), (n = 5), giving (m + n = 6).

---

## Formula for the sum of interior angles

The sum of the interior angles of a single regular (n)-gon is:

[
(n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ
]

For (m) such polygons, the total sum is:

[
S = m(n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ
]

---

## Divisibility condition

We need (S) to be divisible by 27, so:

[
m(n - 2) \\times 180 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{27}
]

Simplify by dividing by 9 (since (\\gcd(180, 27) = 9)):

[
m(n - 2) \\times 20 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}
]

Since 20 and 3 are coprime, this reduces to:

[
m(n - 2) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}
]

---

## Finding the minimum (m + n)

We need the smallest integers (m \\geq 1) and (n \\geq 3) such that (m(n - 2)) is divisible by 3. Consider the smallest (n) where (n - 2) is divisible by 3: (n = 5) gives (n - 2 = 3), so (m = 1) satisfies the condition. Thus, (m + n = 1 + 5 = 6).

---

## Verification

For (m = 1) and (n = 5):

[
S = 1 \\times (5–2) \\times 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ
]

Check divisibility: (540 \\div 27 = 20), which is an integer, so the condition is satisfied.

---

## Conclusion

The minimum value of (m + n) is **6**, achieved when (m = 1) and (n = 5).

Fig. 1
Conceptual scheme to generate self-locking kinematic chains and tessellations along with their paperboard prototypes.

a The building block of our reconfigurable class of rigidly flat-foldable materials. Primitive regular polygon describing a four-bar linkage, followed by in-plane angled (ϕ) extrusion (red arrow of length b) of constitutive links; connection of extruded panels with isosceles triangular panels; addition of fold lines and assignment of a mountain (M) and valley (V). Upon folding, the unit chain reconfigures to reach its lock state (specified with " L ") where contact is established between panels. b Concept abstraction to generate unit chains with an N even-sided regular polygon for representative N, i.e. 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. The first three rows show respectively the developed, partially folded, and one of the (multiple) lock states. The last two rows show the in-plane tessellation and their paperboard proof-of-concepts. The latter are multilayered spatial realizations obtained with the minimum number of layers, i.e. an even number of layers preserving their symmetry with respect to x-y plane, that provides one degree of freedom. Rubber bands are here used to hold the unloaded configuration of the prototypes in their lock state, as the transition to the lock state requires the application of compressive forces in the x - y plane, as explained later in the manuscript. Scale bars = 30 mm.

The fold lines of both V and M panels enable the system to act as a kinematic chain, in short, "unit chain". We define its configurational changes (Fig. 1a) using m independent dihedral angles θ 1, θ 2,… Each dihedral angle specifies the convex angle between the triangular panel and its adjacent quad panel (Fig. 1a), and m denotes the mobility or nontrivial (term hereafter dropped) DoFs excluding rigid-body motions. We also assume the mountain and valley fold lines are constrained to remain on two parallel planes during folding. Explained later, this strategy is enforced through unit chain stacking, and it enables folding with a single DoF. In this case, the out-of-plane rise, h, is expressed as a function of three geometric parameters by:

### Oriented cell division shapes carnivorous pitcher leaves of sarracenia purpurea [^6c9f9196]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

where S i is the area of cell i, L j is the length of edge j, L k is the length of outermost edge k, and K S, K B, K R, K E and L E are constants. The first term of the right-hand side represents area elasticity, where cell i has a target area s i that depends on its edge number N i and is given by the relative area of N i -sided regular polygon to that of regular hexagon, namely, s i = N i tan(π /6)/6 tan(π / N i). K S denotes the elastic constant. The second term describes the conservation force of edge length, where each edge has the target lengthat which the potential energy function reaches a minimum. This condition ensures that neighbouring vertices do not become extremely close because of repulsive force. The third term indicates the elastic force that maintains the outermost edges at a constant length L E with the elastic coefficient K E, which reflects that the outer cell wall is usually thickened and stiffened by a cuticle.

In animal cell models, it is usually assumed that vertices are reconnected to mimic cell movement if an edge becomes extremely short. In contrast, because the plant cell wall prevents changes in the relative position of cells, such reconnection process is not permitted in our model. In addition, neighbouring vertices are prohibited to be extremely close by potential energy as described above.

Programmes were written in C and the vertex position (x j) was iteratively calculated every time step Δ t = 0.005, using the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method.

Methods

Numerical methods

We build the numerical hydrodynamic environment of microswimmers using a 3D boundary integral methodto solve the Stokes equation. Specifically, we adopt a regularized Stokeslet method, with more details provided in SI.

Lower-level RL

Observations

At the lower level of our hierarchical RL framework, the agent observes the joint angles Θ of a simulated robot as proprioceptive sensory inputs. For ring swimmers, the angles are within a symmetric range, namely. However, this situation changes for a flagellar swimmer: its propulsion admits a symmetric range, whereas its reorientation necessitates an asymmetric one, with α = 0.5. We illustrate the influence of α on the swimmer's translational and rotational velocities in the SI. Moreover, the maximum angleof flagellar swimmers is limited to 2 π /(N + 1) to prevent links from crossing. For ring swimmers, is adopted to allow reasonable body deformation while avoiding intersections of links.

When training the robots, we judge whether an obtained action might result in limit-exceeding joint angles or crossing links. If either condition is met, a null action is implemented.

Actions

The action of an agent is encoded by a vector a ∈ [−1, 1] N, which correlates with the angular velocities Ω via a linear mapping, Ω = B a. Here, the linear operator B depends on the topology of the multi-link swimmer. For chain swimmers. In contrast, for a ring swimmer, the formulation of B warrants special consideration due to the geometric constraints imposed by its links, which form an N -sided equilateral polygon.

For this polygon, the links form a closed loop, imposing the following constraints on the joint angles Θ and uniform side length L / N :Taking the time derivative of Eq. (1), we obtain the constraint on Θ, which simplifies to C Ω = 0 whereThis constraint is fulfilled by setting, with C + denoting the Moore-Penrose inverse of C.

### Two-dimensional tessellation by molecular tiles constructed from halogen-halogen and halogen-metal networks [^82313c0a]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Enlarged views of STM images (Fig. 4e–g) reveal the detailed structures around the tessellation vertices. In structure A, the polygons that cross at the interwoven vertex (black circle in Fig. 4e) consist of one red triangle, two parallelograms, and two blue triangles. The red triangle is perfectly aligned with one of the blue triangles (highlighted by dashed white lines), leading to 60° and 120° interior angles in the parallelogram. The angular sum of the polygons involved is therefore 360°, resulting in perfect tessellation. The tile representation in Fig. 4h highlights the interwoven vertex, which is consistent with the observations in Fig. 4e. According to the nomenclature defined by Grünbaum and Shephard, the lattice can be named using a set of integers in the form (n 1 α1. n 2 α2.···) to represent a vertex surrounded by polygons in a clockwise sequence; n i represents the number of sides on the polygon, and α i denotes the number of adjacent polygons of the same type. Since we have two triangle types with different side lengths, we differentiate them as 3 α and 3 β. Therefore, structure A can be described as tiling (3 α.4.3 β 2.4). Apparently, this packing geometry has a chiral structure. The STM images of two enantiomorphous domains are shown in Supplementary Fig. 6. Because structure B can be interconverted to structure A by exchanging red and blue lines, it can be described as tiling (3 α 2.4.3 β.4) (see tile representation in Fig. 4i). Structure C contains two types of interwoven vertex configurations (Fig. 4j). As shown in Fig. 4g, the vertex marked by the yellow circle has an arrangement identical to that in structure B (Fig. 4f), while the vertex marked by the black circle is the chiral isomer of that shown in structure A (Fig. 4e). This complex configuration can be expressed as tiling (3 α.4.3 β 2.4); (3 α 2.4.3 β.4).

### The cellPhe toolkit for cell phenotyping using time-lapse imaging and pattern recognition [^351b94ac]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Textural features of each cell are represented in terms of three first order statistics calculated from the pixel intensities within the cell: mean, variance and skewness. For second order texture features, we used grey-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCMs)but, rather than consider the positions of pixels within a cell, we calculated GLCMs between the image of the cell at different resolutions to differentiate textures that are sharp and would be lost at lower resolution from those that are smooth and would remain. This was achieved by performing a two-level 2-D wavelet transformon the pixels within the axis-aligned minimum rectangle containing a cell. GLCMs were then calculated between the original interior pixels and the corresponding values from the first and second levels of the transform as well as between the two sets of transformed pixels (levels 1 and 2). Statistics first described by Haralickwere then calculated from each GLCM. We use 14 of the 20 Haralick features described by Löfstedt et al.: Angular Second Moment, Contrast, Correlation, Variance, Homogeneity, Sum Average, Sum Variance, Entropy, Sum Entropy, Difference Variance, Difference Entropy, Information Measure of Correlation 2, Cluster Shade, Cluster Prominence. With three co-occurrence matrices, this gives 42 Haralick features. We calculated spatial distribution descriptors to quantify the uniformity or clustering of cell interior pixels at different intensity levels. IQ n is a measure of dispersion calculated for the subset of interior pixels with intensities greater than or equal to the (n × 10)th quantile. Based on a Poisson distribution, for which the mean is equal to the variance, the measure is calculated as the variance divided by the mean, calculated over the pairwise distances between pixels within the n th subset. IQ n = 1 indicates a random distribution whereas a value of IQ n less than 1 indicates that the pixels are more uniformly distributed and a value > 1 indicates clustering.

### Cortical thickness systematically varies with curvature and depth in healthy human brains [^4c04d438]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

2.4.2 Mean curvature

Unlike Gaussian curvature, mean curvature is an extrinsic property of the surface, providing a useful measure of foldedness. It has an intuitive meaning, changing as a piece of paper is folded into a cone or cylinder. Just like paper folding, the extent of shape change might be restricted by intrinsic properties of the surface, such as its initial thickness and surface area (Mota & Herculano‐Houzel). The direction of the outward unit normal provides the orientation at a given point, so that the mean curvature distinguished between convex and concave shapes. It has previously been shown to be a good indicator of gyral and sulcal patterns of the cortex (Batchelor et al; Cachia et al; Luders et al.). For discrete surfaces, the mean curvaturecan be calculated bywhereis the number of edges connected to the vertex; denotes the length of the i th edge connected to the vertex; is the dihedral angle, or the angle between normal vectors of the adjacent triangles meeting at the edge; andis the sum of the areas of the adjacent triangles (Mesmoudi et al.) (Figure 6). This formulation assumes that the neighboring vertices of the polygon is a cylindrical arc with a small radius tangent to adjacent edges.

2.4.3 Principal curvatures

At a given point on a curved surface, there are two orthogonal planes that correspond to the maximum and minimum normal curvatures, and, respectively. (Here we use the convention, but note that some studies instead use.) The principal curvatures are quantified as the reciprocal of the radius of the circle of best fit tangent to the surface at that point. The local shape of a point on an arbitrary surface can be determined by principle curvatures (Figure 7). They can be calculated from the mean and Gaussian curvature asand) (Gray,) or conversely, the mean and Gaussian curvature can be written in terms of principal curvatures asand, respectively. In this study, we calculated the principal curvatures from the values of mean and Gaussian curvature at each vertex (Hu et al.).

### Shape morphing of plastic films [^a96c261a]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Polygons

The adhesive layer was parallelly aligned with certain intervals. The width of the adhesive layer (w a) was calculated from the interior angles ɵ and the diameter of the peeled-off film, d, where w a = (180− ɵ) π d /360. The intervals are equal to the corresponding side length. Taking right triangle with interior angles of 60° and the shortest side length of 10 mm as an example, the diameter of peeled-off PTFE film (thickness of 80 μm, width of 4 mm) with Kapton tape as the adhesive layer and a peeling angle of 180° is 2 mm; thus, the widths of adhesive layers should be 2.62, 1.57, 2.09 and 2.62 mm, respectively, and the corresponding intervals should be 17.3, 10 and 20 mm, respectively (Fig. 3e). The PTFE film (thickness of 80 μm, width of 4 mm) was adhered vertical to the adhesive layer and peeled off at peeling angle of 180°. For an isosceles right triangle with a short side length of 10 mm, the widths of adhesive layers should be 2.36, 1.57, 2.36, and 2.36 mm, respectively, and the corresponding intervals should be 10, 10, and 14.1 mm, respectively. For an equilateral triangle with a side length of 10 mm, the widths of adhesive layers should be 2.09, 2.09, 2.09, and 2.09 mm, respectively, and the corresponding intervals should be 10, 10 and 10 mm, respectively. For the equilateral polygon with a side length of 10 mm, the widths of adhesive layers are 1.57, 1.26, and 1.05 mm with intervals of 10 mm for quadrangle, pentagon and hexagon, respectively.

### A micro-architectured material as a pressure vessel for green mobility [^21fbacbb]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Figure 4b depicts the variation in the area and thickness of the outer shell and interior frame with the number of cells N along one direction under a constant yield pressure P o = 0.01 σ o, as assumed in Fig. 2, and total internal volume equal to that of a spherical vessel with an inner diameter of 1 m. The surface area of the outer shell remains almost constant regardless of N, whereas the area of the inner frame increases in proportion to N and soon considerably exceeds that of the outer shell. Consequently, the sum of the two areas increases linearly with N, that is, as the cell size D decreases. By contrast, the shell thickness t decreases rapidly at N values lower than 20 and decreases more slowly thereafter at higher N values. As a result, as depicted in Fig. 4c, the solid volume of the outer shell, which is calculated by multiplying its surface area with its thickness t, decreases rapidly from the initial value (V s /V in = 0.027 at N = 2) and soon converges to 1/17 of the initial value, whereas the solid volume of the interior shell increases rapidly from the initial value (V s /V in = 0.00225 at N = 2) and soon converges to five times the initial value. Consequently, the sum of the two solid volumes (i.e. total vessel weight divided by the density of the constituent material) decreases from the initial value (V s /V in = 0.0293 at N = 2), drops below that of the spherical pressure vessel (V s /V in = 0.0149) at N = 15, and finally converges V s /V in = 0.0133 at N = 40. Considering the variation of shell thickness, depicted in Fig. 4c, the total weight of the double-chambered shellular vessel, which is lower than that of the spherical vessel, can be attributed not only to the fact that the second chamber is secured by simply adding the minimal weight of the sealing caps to the single-chambered version but also the fact that the shell thickness t rapidly decreases as the number of cells N increases. Here, the solid volume is expressed as a dimensionless form, solid ratio by dividing with the constant internal volume. The solid volumes are derived in the Supplementary Note 4.

### Shape morphing of plastic films [^835f8daf]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Through discrete peeling of the film belt, local curvature can be programmed and thus different polygonal shapes such as triangle, quadrangle, pentagon and hexagon were also obtained by simply arranging the adhesive layers with predetermined widths and intervals according to the interior angles and side lengths of the targeted shape and peeling the film under the according parameters (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Movie 7). Taking right triangle with an interior angle of 60° and shortest side of 10 mm and the 80 μm thick PTFE film at a peeling angle of 180° as an example, the diameter of the peeled film, d is ~2 mm and thus the widths of adhesive tapes (w a = (180 - θ)π d /360, θ is the interior angle) are 2.62 mm, 1.57 mm and 2.09 mm for interior angles of 30°, 90°, and 60°, respectively and intervals are 17.3, 10 and 20 mm, respectively (Fig. 3e, left). When peeling the film at peeling angle of 180°, the default right triangle was obtained (Supplementary Movie 7). Furthermore, complex 3D structures can be designed and fabricated through a multistep peeling process. For example, a two-step peeling process with orthogonal peeling directions and opposite curling directions can form hyperboloids (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Movie 8). In step I, a PTFE film (4 cm × 2 cm) was attached on two separated adhesive tapes (1 cm × 2 cm with an interval of 2 cm) and peeled off along the red line (Fig. 3f, left); in step II, the other side of the PTFE film was adhered on the adhesive tape (2 cm × 2 cm) and peeled off along the blue line with different peeling angles for the hyperboloids and semi-hyperboloids, before which the parts adhered in the first step were cut into parallel strips along their curling direction. More complex final 3D geometries can also be programmed by designing the layout of the 2D precursors and peeling them along the default routes (adhered regions, peeling direction, and peeling angle). Using this method, we obtained seventeen highly complex 3D geometries from ten 2D precursors and remarkably good agreement between experimental results and FEA predictions further verified the versatility of this shape-morphing strategy and the accuracy of the models (Fig. 4). Apart from the polymer films, the peeling-induced shape morphing strategy is also applicable to other materials capable of plastic deformation, such as metals (copper, silver, aluminum, nickel, titanium, and iron), semiconductor polymer films (poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl), P3HT), filter paper, and composite films ranging from centimeter to micrometer (Supplementary Fig. 18).

### The 30-degree angle revisited [^eec48357]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The standard surgical ellipse, with 30 degrees apical angles and a length-to-width ratio of 2 or 3 to 1, works optimally on a flat surface. The same pattern, when used for excisions on strongly convex or concave surfaces, leads to distortions which may require significant revisions. The reason for these discrepancies is explainable by the mathematical differences between flat Euclidian geometry and curved non-Euclidian geometry. Understanding these basic mathematical principles as applied to cutaneous surgery should lead to better preoperative planning, fewer intraoperative surprises, and more pleasing results.

### Voxel volume overlap: voxel-size sensitive indicators of subject motion in functional MRI [^af0c85b6]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

Algorithmic implementation: Comparing the moved cube to the reference cube was achieved as follows: each reference cube is described by six planes, constituting inequality constraints. Each plane is defined by one point on each surface and a corresponding norm vector, defining "inside" (and consecutively, of course, "outside"), establishing a set of six cutting planes. The reference cube is then moved, using the rigid‐body parameters from the realignment procedure. This creates the moved cube described by its eight (moved) corners and their connections, which again are vectors. The intersection of these vectors with a given cutting plane can be calculated using linear interpolation, resulting in a new set of (cut) vectors, jointly defining a new (cut) surface. The iterative application of all six cutting planes will remove all parts of the moved cube that are "outside" of the reference voxel's boundaries. The coordinates of the remaining shape can then be used to generate a convex 3D shape using Delauney triangulation. As rotations are involved, the shape may be irregular, but it is a polygon, and every polygon can be triangulated (de Berg et al.). This triangulation will yield a set of tetrahedra whose (sum of) volumes can be calculated. The volume of this remnant of the moved cube can then finally be related to the volume of the reference cube.

### A universal state and its relaxation mechanisms of long-range interacting polygons [^3f92af34]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

We further apply this simulation across a broad density range and summarize all results with two phase diagrams in Fig. 1g, for squares and triangles, respectively. When the cut-off distance R c is small, the stable states depend on shape and exhibit very poor 6-fold symmetry; however once the cut-off distance is large enough, the hexagonal plastic crystal universally appears. This is true for a broad density range, confirming the robust shape independency experimentally observed. In addition, simulations further reveal that adding or removing the long-range interaction tail only changes the total system energy by a small fraction around 15%, yet it completely eliminates the shape dependency, significantly changes the phase space, and makes the plastic crystal a universal state for various polygons.

Distinct structures formed by particle vertices

Experiments and simulations demonstrate that polygon shape makes very slight influence on the static structure of particle centers in the long-range interaction regime. Consequently, we may naturally ask: what is the role of shape in this regime then? Further investigation reveals that shape strongly influences the arrangement of particle vertices and determines the dynamic responses. In Fig. 2a, b we demonstrate the vertex structures of square and triangle systems, with the nearby vertices connected for a better illustration. Strikingly, despite that the raw images are exactly the same as Fig. 1b, c, the patterns formed by vertices give a completely different impression without any obvious hexagonal symmetry.

The arrow lines in the motifs indicate the particle orientations. The red polylines in the main panel label some typical motif 3 structures which are essential for system relaxation as shown later. Note that Fig. 2a, b use the identical raw images as Fig. 1b, c. c 2D Fourier transform of square vertices indicates 6-fold symmetry. d 12-fold symmetry appears around ka /2 π = 2 for triangle vertices, with a the average particle distance. e collection of triangles' neighboring vertices from all configurations at this density. f 2D Fourier transform of e also exhibits an obvious 12-fold symmetry around ka /2 π = 2

### Hexanematic crossover in epithelial monolayers depends on cell adhesion and cell density [^4f6f6454]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The hexanematic crossover scale depends on the monolayer density and cell line.

a Illustration of the shape function γ p defined in Eq. (1). The magnitude ∣ γ p ∣ of this complex function quantifies the resemblance of the cell shape from that of a regular p -sided polygon, while its phaseyields the cell's p -fold orientation. In this example, a perfectly hexagonal cell (top) has ∣ γ 6 ∣ = 1 and ∣ γ 2 ∣ = 0. Conversely, for an elongated hexagonal cell (bottom), both ∣ γ 2 ∣ and ∣ γ 6 ∣ are finite. b The magnitude of the shape function, 〈| γ p |〉, for different mean cell-cell distances. Differences between the hexatic and nematic shape functions, 〈| γ 6 |〉−〈| γ 2 |〉, are shown in c. The p -values for the comparison of different density ranges are presented in Supplementary Table S2. d Correlation between the mean shape index and mean shape function. e Schematic representation of the coarse-graining procedure used for the computation of the scale-dependent shape parameter Γ p = Γ p (R) for the specific case p = 2. To compute the parameter at the point r n, the shape function γ 2 is averaged within a disk of radius R from r n. The procedure is repeated for each of the red point, corresponding to the nodes of a regular square grid of lattice spacing R cc /2. See the subsection Shape Parameter in Methods for further details. f, g The difference between the scale-dependent hexatic and nematic shape parameter, ΔΓ = Γ 6 − Γ 2, plotted as a function of the coarse-graining radius and the mean cell-cell distance for MDCK-II WT (f) and E-cad KO cells (g). Red and blue tones indicate regions of the parameter space where hexatic order prevails over nematic order and vice versa. The white line marks the hexanematic crossover, which is the length scale R × where Γ 6 = Γ 2.

### Microfluidic multipoles theory and applications [^6140a7b0]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

A library of 3D-printed MFM heads, each corresponding to a different geometry obtained by a conformal transformation of the dipole (Table 1), were fabricated. The MFMs.stl files are available in the supplementary mate rial. Figure 3c–h presents six side-by-side comparisons between experimental results and theory. A near perfect correspondence between the experimental and the theoretical model was found for all cases, validating the advection-diffusion model for both known and new geometries. Further comparisons are available in Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6.

Reconfigurable microfluidic multipole devices

Conformal mapping can be used to map any known MFM pattern onto arbitrarily complex geometries comprising an unlimited number of apertures, and to position the apertures according to the predictions of the model. These patterns can then be fabricated by simply positioning the apertures where dictated by the new map. The number of different ways to assign n + 2 flow modes (aspiration, stop, or injection of n different reagent conditions) for a MFM device with a apertures is large, scaling with (n + 2) a. Several symmetries can be exploited in laying out the position of the apertures to achieve periodic patterning of a surface in order to achieve particular confinement geometries. In this section, we highlight two of them, the rotationally-symmetric MFM (rMFM) and the translationally-symmetric MFM (tMFM), obtained via our theory-assisted design approach.

The rotationally-symmetric MFM configuration is achieved by making all aspiration apertures in a MFM superpose to form a central drain around which injection apertures are placed to form the vertices of a regular polygon. The advection-diffusion profile can thus be expressed exactly by a transformation of the type "flower" presented in Table 1 and already described in Figs. 2c, f, and 3f, g. rMFMs allow the largest theoretical number of possible independent confined reagent conditions (a −1) using a apertures (see Fig. 4a). Furthermore, the confinement area (henceforth defined as "petals" to extend the flower analogy) can easily be kept stable by compensating for the flow variations while some openings are turned on and off. For that reason, rMFM can be used as a chemical stroboscope, enabling the precise and independent spatiotemporal control of chemical pulses above a surface.

### Increased tortuosity of ACA might be associated with increased risk of ACoA aneurysm development and less aneurysm dome size: a computer-aided analysis [^f3471392]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sum of angle metrics

Calculation of SOAM begins from the division of curve into the subcurves of equal length. Then, for each subcurve, we calculate supplementary of the angle between lines connecting its center and ends. Angles are summed up and the result is normalized by the length of the entire curve:where φ indicates measured angles and n is its count. For a curve that is straighter, supplementary angles are larger and therefore the entire SOAM is larger. This descriptor is also sensitive to local tortuosity (Fig. 2 b).

Product of angle distance

The PAD is calculated using the below formula:

This descriptor defines global tortuosity which is the combination of deviation from the straight line given by RL and local angles metrics, which is given by the SOAM.

Triangular index

To calculate TI, the curve must be again divided into equal subcurves. Then, a triangle is built with vertices on each end of the subcurve and in its middle point. TI is calculated using the below formula:where n is the number of subcurves, a and b are the triangle sides, and c is its base. TI is smaller for more straight curves (Fig. 2 c).

Inflection count metrics

Inflection point is a point on a curve where it changes from being concave to being convex, or vice versa. ICM is defined with below formula:where n I is the number of curve's inflection points. That factor is more sensitive to global curvature than RL and is lower for more straight curves (Fig. 2 d).

Additional measurements

For each analyzed segment of ACA, we measured its diameter, which was defined as the shortest distance between the artery edge points in the selected region. In a similar way, we measured the diameter of C7 segment of ICA. We also obtained the length of A1–A3 ACA segments.

### Polygonal non-wetting droplets on microtextured surfaces [^a1f71d42]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

As shown in Fig. 2b plotted in polar coordinates, three diagrams ε 1 (α), ε 2 (α), and ε 3 (α) were drawn as a function of α. First, the relationship between ε 1 (α) and α for reference point 1 was checked. As expected, some maximum values of ε 1 (α) (ε 1max (α) ≈ 0.66 at α ≈ 90°, 0°, and –90°) were obtained. For reference point 2, obviously ε 2max (α) ≈ 0.87 at α ≈ 63° and –63°. For reference point 3, ε 3max (α) = 1.0 appeared at α = 0°. The combination of reference points 1, 2, and 3 suggested that α ≈ 0°, 63°, and –63° corresponded to the three highest values of ε, and the most possible directions to block the three-phase contact lines. As shown in Fig. 2c, a total of six directions along which the side of the droplet would mostly be blocked were obtained since the y -axis was set as the axis of surface symmetry. This finally resulted in a hexagonal droplet pattern shape. In sum, the above explanations suggested consistency between the theoretical analyses and experimental results. Thus, the formation of a polygonal droplet pattern resulted from the energy barrier in certain movement directions of the liquid. Basically, an infinite number of reference points existed, but the underlying physics would not change. The above-illustrated method can be used as a universal way to predict the droplet patterns for other cases, such as the outcomes in Fig. 1b–e (Supplementary Discussion 5, Supplementary Fig. 8).

### The rule of 57: orthopaedic trigonometry made easy [^2a37b853]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Rule of 57 is an easy method for planning osteotomies and calculating translations when correcting spine and limb deformities.

Methods

The rule is based on the mathematical principle that a circle with a radius of 57 mm has a circumference of 360 mm where each 1° of the circle subtends an arc of 1 mm in length.

Results

Thus a 1 mm opening or closing wedge osteotomy with a width of 57 mm would result in 1° of angular correction.

Discussion

This basic geometric shape can be extrapolated in many ways to determine proper alignment for preoperative planning, performing osteotomies, understanding guided growth, and executing a variety of deformity corrections.

### Minimum electric-field gradient coil design: theoretical limits and practical guidelines [^070d751c]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Force and torque constraints can be added using the known main B 0 field distribution, integrating over the current distribution for each basis function and entering the results into matrix H or C. One row is added for each direction of force or torque, to obtain an overall magnitude constraint. Eddy currents are computed in a similar manner; the step response for time‐dependent eddy currents on the surface of a conducting cylinder — typically the thermal shield in the magnet — is computed at multiple points in space and time. Each point in space and time is entered as a separate inequality constraint equation. It is usually sufficient to constrain eddy currents at time = 0 following a step change in gradient current, reducing the size of the problem.

Finally, and of primary significance to the present work, E‐field constraints can be handled in a similar manner to those for force and torque. At gradient frequencies of interest, the time evolution of E‐fields in human tissues is short, and therefore proportional to instantaneous slew rate and not the detailed waveform shape in time. Thus, given a body model, the E‐field is computed from each gradient coil basis function for unit slew rate at a series of points over the body surface, such as using the methods we have described recently. 17 Calculation at points on the interior of the model is not required, as the maximum magnitude always occurs on the surface of a uniform body model (see Supporting Information). A magnitude constraint is created on the surface by placing a series of rotated inequality constraints on the vector E‐field tangent to the surface. For example, we choose 32 directions at each point spaced over 360º, which constrains the magnitude to within 0.5% of the desired value.

### Geometric frustration in polygons of polariton condensates creating vortices of varying topological charge [^3bf44056]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

We observe that in some instances for frustrated odd-numbered polygons, the condensates do not successfully "agree" with each other on which direction to form a current. This leads to a state that does not have a single central vortex but rather forms a vortex–antivortex pair as shown in Fig. 5. Figure 5a, b shows the experimental real-space magnitude of the PL and phase, respectively. The diagonal dashed lines are guide to the eye marking a split in density across the condensate polygon. Figure 5c shows a zoomed-in region corresponding to the black dashed square. A vortex–antivortex pair can be observed with cores separated by ~1 μm. Figure 5d–g shows a corresponding numerical simulation of a condensate steady state with a vortex–antivortex pair, obtained by displacing pump spot number 4 in the pentagon by 2.8 μm radially outwards. Figure 5h shows that the measured phase difference between the vertices 0–1, 1–2, 2–3, and 0–3 is equal to π, whereas the phase of condensate 4 is not well defined due to destructive interference, fracturing it into two parts. Line profiles taken along the black circles in Fig. 5c, f unveil an opposite 2 π phase winding about each of the vortex cores (see Fig. 5i).

### Shaping micro-clusters via inverse jamming and topographic close-packing of microbombs [^7662020f]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Programming the degrees of freedom in topographic clusters

Empirically, the final clusters can be programmed by the number of seeds (N = 1, 2, 3,…) and the number of vertices of the well (V = 0, 3, 4, 5, and 6 for circles, triangles, squares, pentagons, and hexagons, respectively) providing topographic confinement. As shown in Fig. 5a, we analyzed over 2000 clusters. In the confinement of N = 1, single-cell particles could be created by filling the microwell, imitating the shape of the confinement. For N > 1, the differentiated cleavages were symmetric when k = V / N yielded an integer k, i.e. (V, N) = (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 3), (4, 2), (6, 2), and (6, 3). Otherwise, clusters with random microbomb assembly were observed. Regarding the orientation of the constituent cells, the (6, 2) combination, for example, could program two types of symmetric clusters: one with a cleavage wall normal to one of the 6 edges where the interior angle of a unit is 3 π (marked as a black line), and the other containing two isosceles trapezoids (internal angle is 2 π) shares the space diagonally (marked as a blue line). In addition, it is important to note that since there are no predictable cues for the cleavage orientation in the case of the singularity (V = 0), the perfect programming of clusters (100%) for all cases of N is warranted from the non-pinning mobility in confinement. The SEM images in Fig. 5b, c reveal the hollow nature of the clusters from a triangular prism (Fig. 5b) and a cube with a cleavage connecting four cells (Fig. 5c) after focused ion beam (FIB) milling. At room temperature, the shell became glassy again, and thus the microbombs could maintain the packed shape permanently.

### Cone photoreceptor definition on adaptive optics retinal imaging [^a293ce46]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Automated and manual cone counting

Automated and manual counting was performed using 10 high quality images of controls at 5° retinal eccentricity, with a central sampling area 300×300 px (equal to the central 240×240 μm). The observer was masked to the identity of the subjects during this process.

The density of photoreceptors with varying retinal eccentricity was also calculated using both manual and automated counting techniques in three subjects at 2, 3, 5 and 7° retinal eccentricities. The AO images captured at 0° were not included as part of either counts as the device was unable to resolve any retinal structure less than 4 μm, as noted in figure 2 A, B.

Voronoi domain analysis

Voronoi tessellation was performed on the AO retinal images of the 10 subjects following cone identification by the automated algorithm. The percentage of cone photoreceptors showing optimal hexagonal (n = 6) tiling as well as 5- and 7-sided (n ± 1) organisation was calculated for each of the 10 images. We manually excluded the polygons on the edges of the image to avoid any bias to result (figure 2 C. Voronoi tessellation of subject A's retinal image at 5° retinal eccentricity). Voronoi quantification was also completed for the three subjects at the 2, 3, 5 and 7° retinal eccentricities.

Power spectrum analysis

Spatial regularity (hexagonal packing) of photoreceptors is known to result in a ring structure in the power spectrum of a retinal image. This analysis was performed in our study (figure 3 A).

### Elliptical ejecta of asteroid dimorphos is due to its surface curvature [^547ab092]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The position angle search obtains the position angle at the bright-pixel count's peak as a mean and the peak's width as a 1 σ uncertainty (Table 2). Finding the width is not challenging because the peak is a single set with a Gaussian-like distribution without overlapping with other peaks. Averaging out the measurements of all HST images reduces the number of data samples to a single sample, as HST's view plane does not change significantly. For LICIACube images, the samples at the earliest and latest epochs capture the front and back sides of the ejecta cone.

The cone geometry determination process uses the measured position angles to obtain the cone's geometric parameters (D E C, R A, ϕ, θ 1, θ 2), assuming the ejecta cone geometry is time-invariant. The following formula gives the score for the k -th image:where n is the number of pixels in the image, and i represents the northern and southern edges. x k, j is the position angle of a simulated pixel j, μ k, i is the mean of the measured northern or southern edges, and σ k, i is its standard deviation. The final score is a sum of X k (k = 1. 6). The score of the k -th image becomes zero if the view conditions are inconsistent in the simulated and measured cone geometries. For example, such a condition includes when the simulated cone geometry predicts either front or back views while the measured cone is in the side view. Monte Carlo simulations consider 500 cases by varying the measured position angles based on Gaussian uncertainties.

### Starting geometry creation and design method for freeform optics [^44fabd79]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Starting geometry creation and down-selection

The creation of a geometry that maximizes the benefit from freeform surfaces and requires less overall freeform departure, which also results in lower surface slope when only low-order (here up to Z15) Zernike polynomials are considered, is an important step in reducing the sensitivity and fabrication costs of the final design. Instead of first constructing a fully obscured rotationally symmetric system that is corrected through third-order then tilting the surfaces into a planar symmetric unobscured geometry as one might do with an off-axis conic or asphere design, this method focuses on first developing the geometries that are conducive to the application of freeform surfaces.

For a general optical system with some freedom to choose the folding geometry, this process begins by constructing a first-order optical layout in each possible permutation of surface tilt directions and image plane locations within each permutation. The magnitudes of the surface tilts should be minimized to what is necessary to avoid obscurations. An important feature and key point is that it is not critical at this stage that the layout variables (that is, surface powers and airspaces) take specific values, but rather are chosen to hold system constraints, such as focal length and system volume. The power distribution is typically chosen based on packaging constraints, surface sizes, flat-field conditions, and FOV requirements. The following N + 1 step procedure may be used to help determine layout variables that provide a sufficient starting point for a general optical system with N surfaces. Given a target system volume, as Step 1, set all airspaces between each surface to be roughly equivalent and to take full advantage of the allowed volume. With a chosen power distribution, in Steps 2 to N, assign radius of curvature values to the first N -1 optical surfaces, where all negative surfaces have radii equal to 1.5–2.5× the chosen airspace value and all positive surfaces have radii equal to 3–4× the chosen airspace value. In the N th + 1 step, the power of the final surface is chosen to hold the focal length of the system. It is important to reiterate that the specific values of the layout variables are not critical provided that the focal length, volume, and obscuration requirements are satisfied. Preferred values of the layout variables are determined in the optimization steps that follow developing this starting point. If other power distributions would satisfy the constraints of the design problem, this process can be repeated. The remainder of the design process will be demonstrated for the three-mirror imager, but can be adapted for a general system. A comprehensive selection of possible geometries for the imager using tilted surfaces is shown in Fig. 1, in which, the geometries have been grouped into a hierarchy of tiers based on the potential of each geometry to be corrected by freeform surfaces as predicted by methods that will be introduced below.

### The alpha angle [^dbd5e95c]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

➢ The alpha angle was originally defined on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, using a plane, parallel to the axis of the femoral neck. However, much of the literature on the alpha angle has used radiographs or other imaging modalities to quantify the alpha angle.➢ The measurement of the alpha angle can be unreliable, particularly on radiographs and ultrasound.➢ If radiographs are used to measure the alpha angle, the circle of best-fit method should be used on multiple different views to capture various locations of the cam lesion, and "eyeballing" or estimating the alpha angle should be avoided.➢ The cam lesion is a dynamic and 3-dimensional (3D) problem and is unlikely to be adequately defined or captured by a single angle.➢ Modern technology, including readily available 3D imaging modalities, as well as intraoperative and dynamic imaging options, provides novel, and potentially more clinically relevant, ways to quantify the alpha angle.

### Seeing around corners with edge-resolved transient imaging [^a18c7a00]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The performance of our reconstruction method relies on a carefully tailored scene model, which must be both flexible and informative while remaining computationally tractable. In natural hidden scenes, we observe that facets tend to be spatially clustered, with clusters representing different objects in the room. We also observe that the positions of facets belonging to the same object tend to describe a 1D manifold. For example, the walls of the room can be described by a concatenation of facets forming the perimeter of the hidden scene. Moreover, the parameters of neighboring facets belonging to the same object are strongly correlated. For example, wall facets tend to share similar heights, albedos and orientations.

These assumptions about scene structure are incorporated into the model via a Bayesian framework by assigning a prior distribution p (Φ, χ) to the set of facets Φ (distance, height, albedo, and orientation angle) and ceiling parameters χ (height and albedo). Interpreting the positions of the planar facets as points in 2D space (top view of the hidden room), we define a spatial point process prior model that favors structured configurations (clusters of 1D manifolds). This model is inspired by recent 3D reconstruction algorithms for LOS single-photon lidar that represent surfaces as 2D manifolds. Inference about the most likely room configuration (Φ, χ) is carried out by maximizing the posterior distributionwheredenotes the likelihood of observing the measurements given the room parameters (Φ, χ), which is computed using the light transport model defined in the previous section.

To solve this problem, we develop a reversible-jump MCMC algorithmthat can estimate both the number of facets and their respective parameters. At each iteration, the algorithm proposes a random, yet guided, modification to the configuration of facets (e.g. addition or removal of a facet), which is accepted with a pre-defined rule (the Green ratio). Note that this approach only requires the local evaluation of the forward model, i.e. for individual wedges, which takes advantage of the fast calculations based on Eqn. (6). In particular, we can efficiently take into account non-linear contributions due to occlusions between facets of a given wedge. By designing tailored updates (see Supplementary Note 2), the algorithm finds a good fit in few iterations, resulting in execution times of approximately 100 s, which is less than the acquisition time of the system.

### Logical circularity in voxel-based analysis: normalization strategy may induce statistical bias [^d5e446ec]. Human Brain Mapping (2014). Low credibility.

Recent discussions within the neuroimaging community have highlighted the problematic presence of selection bias in experimental design. Although initially centering on the selection of voxels during the course of fMRI studies, we demonstrate how this bias can potentially corrupt voxel-based analyses. For such studies, template-based registration plays a critical role in which a representative template serves as the normalized space for group alignment. A standard approach maps each subject's image to a representative template before performing statistical comparisons between different groups. We analytically demonstrate that in these scenarios the popular sum of squared difference (SSD) intensity metric, implicitly surrogating as a quantification of anatomical alignment, instead explicitly maximizes effect size — an experimental design flaw referred to as "circularity bias". We illustrate how this selection bias varies in strength with the similarity metric used during registration under the hypothesis that while SSD-related metrics, such as Demons, will manifest similar effects, other metrics which are not formulated based on absolute intensity differences will produce less of an effect. Consequently, given the variability in voxel-based analysis outcomes with similarity metric choice, we caution researchers specifically in the use of SSD and SSD-related measures where normalization and statistical analysis involve the same image set. Instead, we advocate a more cautious approach where normalization of the individual subject images to the reference space occurs through corresponding image sets which are independent of statistical testing. Alternatively, one can use similarity terms that are less sensitive to this bias.

### The influence of embolization of internal carotid artery aneurysms on arterial tortuosity: a prospective cohort study [^2b2bfe17]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To measure changes in quantitative tortuosity descriptors of the internal carotid artery (ICA) after intracranial aneurysm embolization, and to determine possible factors associated with changes in tortuosity.

Materials and Methods

An analysis of 52 patients with embolized intracranial aneurysms was performed. ICA tortuosity was assessed by digital subtraction angiograms obtained prior to the embolization and after the first follow-up examination. For each patient, tortuosity descriptors were calculated: relative length (RL), sum of angle metrics (SOAM), triangular index, product of angle distance (PAD), and inflection count metric (ICM). To represent changes in tortuosity for each descriptor, delta (Δ) value was defined as value of the descriptor prior to embolization minus value of the descriptor on follow-up examination.

Results

In a median follow-up of 14 months, no statistically significant changes in tortuosity were observed on the nonembolized side. On the embolized side, SOAM (2.89 [SD ± 0.92] vs 2.38 [SD ± 0.94]; P < .001), PAD (5.01 [SD ± 1.83] vs 3.95 [SD ± 1.72]; P < .001), and ICM (12.18 [SD ± 4.55] vs 9.76 [SD ± 4.04]; P = 0.006) were significantly higher after embolization than before embolization. Median ΔRL (-0.02 [-0.045 to 0.002] vs -0.01 [-0.02 to 0.003]; P = 0.003), ΔPAD (0.84 [0.30–1.82] vs 0.10 [-0.001 to 1.10]; P < .001), and ΔICM (2.05 [0.42–3.50] vs 0.27 [0.02–2.16]; P = 0.004) were significantly higher on the embolized side. Tortuosity correlated with elapsed time after embolization.

Conclusions

Tortuosity of the ipsilateral ICA increased after intracranial aneurysm embolization.

### The virtual cone: a novel technique to generate spherical dose distributions using a multileaf collimator and standardized control-point sequence for small target radiation surgery [^718389e8]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Control point sequence

For equally spaced table angles, the possible sets of arrangements are given bywhere N is a positive integer and m is either 0 or 1. For m = 0, one of the table angles is 90 degrees, resulting in irradiation directly along the body axis. Control point sequences were developed for N = 2, m = 1, having θ S = 0, 36, 72, 288, and 324 degrees. For θ S = 0, a full arc was used; for θ S ≠ 0, half arcs were used (gantry range, 0–180 degrees). At each table position, clockwise and counter-clockwise arcs were used with collimator angles of 45 and 135 degrees, respectively. The central 2 leaves of the MLC were set to a small gap and the remaining leaves were positioned 3 cm outside of the secondary collimation, which was 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm. Three plans were created with gaps of 1.6, 2.1, and 2.6 mm. The beam geometry is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1
Beam geometry for table angles 0, 36, 72, 288, and 324 degrees and leaf gap 2.1 mm. The beams-eye-view of the multileaf collimators aperture is shown for (A) clockwise and (B) counterclockwise arcs at table angles 0, 36, 72, 288, and 324 degrees. Arc geometry is shown in (C) the coronal and (D) sagittal planes.

The dose per degree of the arcs was nonuniform and proportional to the sine of the gantry angle. This weighting was chosen because in the limit of large N, a 2π irradiation, it results in uniform fluence per unit area, which is ideal for creating a spherical dose distribution. The treatment plans were created using MatLab (MathWorks, Natick, MA) and exported as Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files that were imported into the Eclipse treatment planning system (Varian Medical Systems, Milpitas, CA). Dose was calculated on a 1 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm grid spacing for the 10 MV flattening filter free beam of an Edge linear accelerator (Varian Medical Systems, Milpitas, CA) using the Eclipse AAA algorithm version 13.6 (Varian Medical Systems).

HIV-1 core traversal induces NPC expansion and deformation

When comparing empty and core-occupied NPCs, we observed a small but significant NPC expansion (93.4 nm to 95.2 nm) upon core traversal (Fig. 3a). Further analysis showed that this apparent NPC expansion was anisotropic, meaning that the structural changes were unevenly distributed, which was not due to the missing-wedge effect (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Video 7). In many cases, one to three subunits deviated from rotational symmetry, contributing to NPC deformation.

### Minimum electric-field gradient coil design: theoretical limits and practical guidelines [^2e257fcf]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Definingas the vector of unknown basis function amplitudes, the solution can be cast into a quadratic programming problem that minimizes energy:subject to the inequality and equality constraints

where M denotes a mutual inductance matrix, and M i, j represents the mutual inductance between basis functions i and j of unit amplitude, and is readily computed from the known current distribution of each basis function. Alternatively, M can be replaced by a mutual resistance matrix to minimize power dissipation, or a weighted combination can be used. We use a mutual inductance matrix for the present work.

The matrices H and C contain the linear constraint equations: one column for each unknown basis function, and one row for each constraint. The desired gradient strength is achieved by enforcing an equality constraint equation at the isocenter, where the value of ce is the negative of the desired gradient strength, and the column entries in the H matrix are the gradient strengths for each basis function of unit amplitude. A B 0 concomitant field constraint can be added that requires the corresponding transverse field component to be zero at the isocenter. Other field constraints such as positional error and pixel size are handled in a similar manner. Within the imaging volume, inequality constraints are placed at multiple points over the imaging volume on the pixel size error and the fractional positional error defined aswhere n is the desired gradient direction (X, Y, or Z); G is the desired gradient strength at isocenter; R is the radius of the imaging volume; and B z is the longitudinal component of field. For the analysis here, we use values of 50% for pixel size (uniformity) error and 16.5% for fractional positional (linearity) error over a 260‐mm‐diameter spherical volume. These typical values (which correspond to design parameters used for a recently described head gradient 14) allow the pixel size to vary by a maximum of a factor of 2 and the maximum positional error to be 21.5 mm at the periphery of the imaging volume.

### Invariant and smooth limit of discrete geometry folded from bistable origami leading to multistable metasurfaces [^5747a454]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 4
Folded configurations of three triangulated hypar origami with different panel widths display invariant hypar geometry (same patterns as in Fig. 1). The three origami patterns have the same number of square creases (counted from the center outwards), denoted by n. Every other square crease is a mountain, and thus there are 10 mountain creases in total. Two panels on the both sides of a mountain crease are assigned the same width. All three concentrically pleated origami can fold approximately into the same hypar shape, as indicated by the red quadratic curves. a Standard hypar pattern: panel width d is a constant for all corrugations. b Functionally graded hypar pattern: panel width d increases as n increases. c Random hypar pattern: panel width d is a random variable for each corrugation. Since the hypar patterns are triangulated, folding is achieved by rigid origami simulation. The left images show the 3D views of the folded hypar origami. The middle images show the side views. The right images present quantitative measures. The blue dots (each dot corresponds to a mountain) in the charts show how (d / L) vanishes as n increases. The green dots show the residual (or error) of Eq. (2) when n is finite

Connecting geometry with mechanics

With an analytical description of the global homogenized geometry of the hypar pattern, we can associate the mechanical behavior of the pattern with its geometry by expressing the system energy in terms of the folding kinematics. First, let us consider how a hypar origami folds into a stable saddle shape. We start from a flat hypar pattern, and forcefully fold up the pattern. After the origami is folded into shape, the folding creases undergo inelastic deformation, which shifts the neutral (i.e. stress free) angles of the folding hinges from zero to the angles at a folded state with shape coefficient k = k 0 (see Eq. 10). However, the panels undergo elastic deformation, as we observe that they return to the initial flat configuration once cut out from a folded hypar origami. Thus, we assume that the bending hinges still have their neutral angles equal to zero, which corresponds to the state at k = 0. A stable configuration is drawn by minimizing the system total energy (E T).

### Scaling behaviour for the water transport in nanoconfined geometries [^10783cfb]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

The expression ofis a classical result of electrostatics and can be justified as follows. Let E be the electric field acting on a dipole μ. The instantaneous energy can be expressed as, with E and μ being the field and dipole strength, respectively, while ϕ is the angle between the direction of the dipole and the field. The minimum and maximum values of energy are attained for ϕ = 0 and π, respectively. However, in the presence of thermal agitation, the direction of μ (hence ϕ) is continuously changing in time. For classical systems, a number of independent dipoles are distributed according to their energy level U c: U c, min < U c < U c, max. In particular, at thermodynamic equilibrium, the Boltzmann distribution predicts that the number N (U c) of dipoles with energy U c is: with C being a constant to be determined. Note that, in three dimensions, all dipoles lying on a cone with angle 2 ϕ around the electrical field direction have the same energy. Moreover, at every ϕ, the total number of such dipoles is N (U c (ϕ))dΩ, with Ω being the incremental solid angle. The above dipoles at ϕ give the component sum d μ in the field direction: Hence, according to the Boltzmann distribution, the average dipole moment takes the more explicit form:

On substituting β = μE / k B T and, the above integral becomes.

On construction of the potential in equation (1) at an arbitrary atom i, a local characteristic length δ i can be defined as δ i = n i,2 − n i,1, where n i,2 and n i,1 are the two zeros of the equation (see Fig. 2c): U eff (n)+ αk B T = 0, where we expect α ≈1/4. In fact, provided that k B T /2 is the kinetic energy attributed the each degree of freedom of the water molecules, for planar surfaces α = 1/4 because molecule are allowed to escape the potential well only along half of the direction orthogonal to the surface. The previous equation implies that water molecules located beyond the characteristic length δ i are in the position of escaping the potential well generated by the N n atoms in the solid wall owing to the kinetic energy k B T. Obviously, when the horizontal line U + αk B T = 0 does not intersect the function in equation (1), δ i = 0.

### Nested helicoids in biological microstructures [^d617e5d6]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The degree of isotropy deeply depends on the range of the total twist angle(Fig. 8d), where, as expected, in a hypothetical full 360° turn the elastic moduli and bending stiffness achieve almost perfect quasi-isotropy; at the observed 180° half-turn the elastic moduli barely approach quasi-isotropy, whereas the bending stiffness is very far from it. Note that in the twist range ~110°–180° the isotropy trend of the tensile moduli is rising whereas that of the shear modulus and bending stiffness is falling, so that a 180° twist favors the tensile moduli over the other constants. Finally, it is seen that the degree of isotropy is not affected by tilting (Fig. 8a, b). Evidently, the in-plane isotropy (or close to it) is an important property of the structure, as the direction of the external loads on the tarsus cannot be predicted, whereas the bending stiffness clearly is higher for bending around the x axis.

The effect of tilting can be observed by comparing the laminate to an identical hypothetical un-tilted laminate. Tilting decreases the in-plane elastic constants significantly (for example, decreases from 14.7 GPa to 9.6 GPa), while increasing the flexural elastic constants significantly (for example, increases from 1.7 N μm 2 to 2.9 N μm 2) (Table 1). This is also shown in Fig. 8a, b as a function of the transformation angle. The reason for these trends is that tilting shifts fibers farther away from the midplane, redistributing the reinforcement material without changing its overall amount. Thus, the overall height of the structure is increased at the expense of reducing the reinforcement density, seen in the laminae/laminate volume fraction, V 1 = 0.7 (Table 1), which without tilting would have been 1. Consequently, the structure is stiffer under flexural loads but less stiff under in-plane stresses, a tradeoff made possible by tilting. Obviously, high flexural stiffness is important in order to resist local contact pressure exerted on the cuticle.

### Minimum electric-field gradient coil design: theoretical limits and practical guidelines [^075005b9]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Regions A and B are geometrically symmetric about the z = 0 plane, with minimum energy solutions (assuming no E‐field constraint) yielding z‐symmetric field solutions and zero B 0 concomitant fields. Hence, the open diamond starting point (representing the minimum energy solution with no E‐field constraints) for the solid and dashed curves (in both black and green cases) coincide. The symmetry is broken by the addition of a patient model with an E‐field constraint.

The knee in the curves marks the point where magnetic energy, current density, and winding complexity increase rapidly as E max is driven to lower values. These complexities render unrealizable or impractical any gradient designs on the vertical portions of the curves to the left of the knee. Examination of winding patterns indicates that solutions that exhibit energy increases > 25% (or even less depending on coil type) above the global minimum energy become unrealizable (eg, demonstrating two or more "eyes" per half coil [four or more total eyes for an x or y coil] in the fingerprint wire patterns).

The red and purple dotted curves in Figure 2 represent two practical cases in which the primary coil currents are restricted to a single inner surface near the patient and the shield coil currents to an outer cylinder, while at the same time adding torque and eddy current constraints. Line segments acd of Figure 1 represent a primary winding surface consisting of a cone and a cylinder, whereas line segment ab represents its cylindrical shield winding; this yields designs similar to those proposed by previous literature 8, 22 and results in the red dotted curves in Figure 2. A second case is defined by restricting primary currents to the cylinder represented by line segment cd and shield currents to the cylinder ab; this yields designs similar to those proposed by previous literature 28 and produces the purple dotted curves in Figure 2. For both configurations, the eddy current surface is a 1‐m‐long, 620‐mm‐diameter cylinder, centered about the gradient isocenter and placed outside the shield winding of the gradient coil. The time = 0 eddy current error is constrained to a peak deviation less than 0.1% of the ideal gradient field on the surface of a 20‐cm‐diameter volume, corresponding to 100 µT for a 1 T/m step change in gradient strength. The torque constraint is set to zero for a uniform z‐directed B 0 main magnetic field. There is no net force for a perfectly uniform main B 0 field in all calculations.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^471f52f2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

The transition between the two regimes is determined by the minimum non-zero betweenness value for the MST, which is O (N) and the tail may have different peaks, determined by the distribution of branches emanating from the tree. Progressively decorating the tree with loops leads to arbitrarily low betweenness values due to the creation of multiple alternate paths, thus smoothing out the distribution, as the betweenness transitions from an interval [N, N 2] for the MST to a continuous distribution over [1, N 2] for the DT.

Spatial distribution of high betweenness centrality nodes

Figure 3e–h shows a single instance of the actual network generated by our procedure for each corresponding edge-density. Highlighted in red are nodes lying in the 90th percentile of betweenness. There is a distinct change in spatial pattern with increasing ρ e; for the MST, they span the network and are tree-like with no apparent spatial correlation; as the network gets more dense, the nodes cluster together and move closer to the barycenter, suggesting a transition between a "topological regime" and a "spatial regime".

To quantify these observed changes, we investigate the behavior of the high BC nodes at and above percentile θ through a set of metrics: the clustering C θ which measures the spread of high betweenness nodes around their center of mass, the anisotropy factor A θ which characterizes the spatial anisotropy of this set of nodes, and finally, the detour factor D which measures the average extent to which paths between two locations deviate from their geodesic distance.

### Invariant and smooth limit of discrete geometry folded from bistable origami leading to multistable metasurfaces [^a4d7097c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The hypar origami is not rigid foldable based on its original pattern. To analytically describe the geometry of each deformed corrugation, we assume that the deformations are isometric, and straight creases remain straight, which requires the introduction of at least one additional diagonal pleat in each trapezoidal panel to triangulate the pattern. We adopt the alternating asymmetric triangulation of Demaine et al.as it satisfies the reflection symmetry required by our present analytical model (see Supplementary Fig. 1). We parametrize a corrugation by one folding angle ρ ϵ [0, π] and two bending angles θ 1, θ 2 ϵ [0, π], considering panel width d and folding ridge length L, as shown in Fig. 2c. The dimensionless width w = (d / L) of a corrugation quickly vanishes away from the center. Denoting n as the number of square creases counted from the center, for a standard hypar pattern, we see that (d / L) = 1/(2 n), regardless of the actual dimension of the pattern. In the limit of w → 0, the twisting angle γ of a long corrugation becomes the average of θ 1 and θ 2. Due to orthogonality of the two symmetry planes, the virtual faces ΔABC and ΔD′E′F′ must be perpendicular to each other (see Fig. 2). Compatibility in radial directions further requires that θ 1 = θ 2. Detailed derivations are presented in Supplementary Note 1. Thus we have

The fact that θ 1 = θ 2 leads to ΔABC ≅ Δ D ′ E ′ F ′, which implies that ζ (r) and ξ (r) have the same constituents at the outer rims, and thus we may assume that ζ (r) and ξ (r) have the same shape, but opposite orientations (see Fig. 2d). Eventually, the twisted opening angle of a long corrugation (ψ ′ in Fig. 2b) becomes

We remark that the same identities resulting from an asymptotic analysis can be obtained using the other triangulation scheme, i.e. the asymmetric triangulation. The same conclusion based on the two triangulation schemes reveals that there are fundamental constructions of the folded hypar pattern, which are independent of local deformations between creases (i.e. within panels), as we take the limit to when each corrugation becomes a fiber on the homogenized surface.

### Compaction of quasi-one-dimensional elastoplastic materials [^46c70653]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Segment size statistics

To better understand the influence of disorder, we choose plastic frictional wires to avoid ordered coils and create the highest possible disorder in the crumpled structure. After compacting the wires, we open the moulds and investigate the resulting compacted structures by analyzing the folding statistics. The points of folding were often determined by sharp changes of wire orientation. If they were not easily distinguishable, then a minimum threshold of 90° for the turning angle of the wire, and a maximum threshold offor the radius of curvature were imposed. We cut the wire at each of the folding points, straighten the segments and measure their length. Straightening of the curved segments rarely allows for segment lengthslonger than the container diameter, but we checked that the maximum segment lengthremains smaller than πR in the absence of coils. We preserve the order of the wire segments and average the results over five realizations for each value of R / r to obtain the sequence of the segment lengths.

A key observation is the scaling of the total number of segments N with the effective system size. Similar scaling laws were reported for 2D packings of wires. As shown in Fig. 2d, a power-law relation of the form

holds with β = 1.86 ± 0.03 for smooth wire and container with wire–wire and container-wire friction coefficientsand, respectively. The exponent can be understood by considering the wire crumpling process as a SAW in confinement. For comparison, for the number of steps on a cubic lattice in an ordinary random walk β equals 2, while for SAW(ref.). The fact that we find an exponent in between these two values can be understood because there is a gradual evolution of spatial correlations over the course of crumpling (see below), thus, the exponent continuously decreases from 2. However, the wires can slide over each other due to the finite friction so that the self-avoidance constraint is only partially fulfilled. For comparison, we repeated the experiment by roughening the plastic wires and the inner surface of the moulds to increase the friction coefficients toand. The considerable change in the wire–wire friction resulted in a smaller exponent β = 1.75 ± 0.05 which is closer to the pure self-avoidance limit (see Fig. 2d). From the scaling of φ max and N withone expects that the normalized mean segment sizefollows, as confirmed by the experimental results in Fig. 2e.

### Astigmatism analysis and reporting of surgically induced astigmatism and prediction error [^dd6214de]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To provide a method for determining the vector that, when added to the preoperative astigmatism, results in no prediction error (PE) and to specify statistical methods for evaluating astigmatism and determining the 95% confidence convex polygon.

Setting

Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, and University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.

Design

Retrospective consecutive case series.

Methods

An analysis of 3 clinical trials involving toric intraocular lenses was performed. 3 formulas were evaluated (generic vergence formula with zero surgically induced astigmatism, the Barrett toric formula, and the Holladay toric formula). Scalar and vector analyses were performed on each dataset with each formula and the results compared. Since the PE was not a Gaussian distribution, a 95% convex polygon was used to determine the spread of the data.

Results

The mean values for the vector absolute astigmatism PEs were not different for the 3 formulas and 3 datasets. The Barrett and Holladay toric calculators were statistically superior to the zero formula for 3 intervals (0.75, 1.0, and 1.25) in the high astigmatism dataset.

Conclusions

Residual astigmatism and vector absolute astigmatism PE mean values and SDs are useful but require extremely large datasets to demonstrate a statistical difference, whereas examining percentages in 0.25 diopters (D) steps from 0.25 to 2.0 D reveals differences with far fewer cases using the McNemar test for a P value. Double-angle plots are especially useful to visualize astigmatic vector PEs, and a 95% confidence convex polygon should be used when distributions are not Gaussian.

### Covariant spatio-temporal receptive fields for spiking neural networks [^3fb65f12]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Dataset

We simulate an event-based dataset consisting of sparse shape contours, as shown in Fig. 8, based on ref. Events are generated by applying some transformation A to the shapes and subtracting two subsequent frames. We then integrate those differences over time until for each pixel, until reaching a certain threshold and emitting events of either positive or negative polarity. This approximates the dynamics of event cameras, which emit discrete events when the intensity changes by a certain threshold. To obtain sub-pixel accuracy, we perform all transformations in a high-resolution space of 2400 × 2400 pixels, which is downsampled bilinearly to the dataset resolution of 300 × 300.

Fig. 8
Image snapshots from the two synthetic datasets used in this work.

The top row shows the four different spatial scaling, corresponding to shapes of 10, 20, 40, and 80 pixels. The bottom row shows the four different temporal velocities, corresponding to a change of 0.16, 0.32, 0.64, and 1.28 pixels per timestep. Both datasets are extremely sparse, with the shapes barely visible in the images. At larger temporal velocities, the shapes become more discernible.

We use three simple geometries, a triangle, a square, and a circle, that are translated with random motion sampled from the same uniform distribution. The shapes are positioned randomly in the image and oriented by a random, fixed angle. Two datasets are studied: one with varying spatial scales and one with varying temporal velocities. In the spatial scale dataset, the starting scale of the shape is logarithmically distributed from 10 to 80 pixels. In the temporal velocity dataset, the shapes scale logarithmically from ± 0.16 to ± 1.28 pixels. The velocities are normalized to the subsampled pixel space such that, for translational velocity, for example, a velocity of one in the x -axis corresponds to the shape moving one pixel in the x -axis per timestep. The velocity parameterizes the sparsity of the temporal scaling dataset, as seen in the bottom row in Fig. 8 panel, where the shape contours in the left panels are barely visible compared to the faster-moving objects in the right panels. To simulate noise, we add 5 ‰ Bernoulli-distributed background noise.

### The need for rotational margins in intensity-modulated radiotherapy and a new method for planning target volume design [^04e89487]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

The effect of rotational errors on the coverage of clinical target volumes (CTVs) is examined. A new planning target volume (PTV) construction that considers the individual paths traced by movements of the target boundary points is developed.

Methods and Materials

A standard uniform margin expansion was compared with a PTV constructed from the space swept out by a concave moving target. A new method formed the PTV by aggregating the separate convex hulls taken of the positions of the individual target boundary points in a sampling of CTV displacements.

Results

A 0.5-cm uniform margin adequate for translations was inadequate given CTV rotation about a fixed off-center axis. A PTV formed of the target's swept-out area was 22% smaller than needed for coverage by a uniform margin, but computationally is not readily extended to translations combined with rotations about a shifting axis. Forming instead the union of convex hulls of the boundary points in a sampling of CTV displacements represented these movements in the PTV design and retained the target's concave shape.

Conclusions

Planning target volumes should accommodate target rotation. The union of convex hulls of the boundary point positions in a sampling of displacements can effectively represent multiple sources of deviations while preserving target concavities.
