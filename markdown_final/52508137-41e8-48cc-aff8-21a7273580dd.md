## Question

What is the recommended treatment for severe hypertriglyceridemia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended treatment for severe hypertriglyceridemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define severity and the clinical priorities by triglyceride level. Then, I should verify the initial assessment for secondary causes and lifestyle triggers. Next, I will consider first-line nonpharmacologic therapy, followed by pharmacologic choices and combinations, including statins, fibrates, and omega-3s. After that, I need to check special populations and acute pancreatitis scenarios, including when to use insulin or plasmapheresis. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and monitoring plan, ensuring I reconcile guideline differences and highlight evidence gaps.

> Let me first confirm the severity definitions and clinical priorities, because treatment hinges on this. Severe hypertriglyceridemia is generally defined as fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL, and very severe as ≥ 1000 mg/dL, where the risk of acute pancreatitis rises substantially and becomes the dominant clinical concern, whereas moderate elevations (150–499 mg/dL) primarily raise atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk and are managed with LDL-C–directed therapy first [^1141uCqq] [^115yBtXB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify secondary contributors before committing to long-term drug therapy. I need to check for diabetes or prediabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome, alcohol use, hypothyroidism, renal or liver disease, and medications that raise triglycerides, because correcting these can substantially lower triglycerides and may obviate the need for intensive pharmacotherapy [^113yTaFD] [^116KRVDw] [^115yBtXB].

> Next, I should review first-line nonpharmacologic therapy, since this is foundational even when triglycerides are very high. A very low-fat diet with fat intake often restricted to about 10–20% of total calories, avoidance of refined carbohydrates and added sugars, elimination of alcohol, weight reduction in those with overweight/obesity, and at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity are core measures. In severe chylomicronemia, fat intake may need to be as low as 15–20 g/day temporarily, with medium-chain triglycerides used for caloric support to avoid essential fatty acid deficiency [^116TRXB8] [^111Sadfk] [^113EYkox].

> I will now examine pharmacologic first-line therapy for severe hypertriglyceridemia when lifestyle measures are insufficient or levels are very high. Fibrates are the preferred first-line agents for severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia because they lower triglycerides by roughly 30–50% and directly target the lipoprotein lipase pathway; fenofibrate is generally preferred over gemfibrozil when combined with statins due to a lower myopathy risk, and dosing should be individualized with reassessment at 4–8 weeks [^113VoWBc] [^1119xTS4] [^115bQ6AG].

> Wait, let me verify the role of omega-3 fatty acids, because guidance differs by formulation and indication. Prescription omega-3s at 2–4 g/day of EPA ± DHA lower triglycerides by about 30% or more and are reasonable alternatives or adjuncts, with EPA-only (icosapent ethyl) avoiding the LDL-C rise sometimes seen with EPA+DHA; however, outcome data for pancreatitis prevention in severe hypertriglyceridemia are limited, so shared decision-making is prudent, and AACE 2025 suggests EPA may be reasonable in select severe cases while noting insufficient evidence for firm recommendations [^113ND9fZ] [^111pXDdH] [^1119xTS4].

> But wait, what if the patient also has intermediate-to-high ASCVD risk; should I add a statin now or later? I should double-check this nuance. Statins are not first-line for severe hypertriglyceridemia when the immediate goal is pancreatitis prevention, yet in adults 40–75 years with severe hypertriglyceridemia and ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%, it is reasonable to address secondary causes and initiate statin therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction, recognizing statins have modest triglyceride-lowering effects of about 10–30% depending on dose and baseline triglycerides [^1113FEAX] [^114rv7WJ] [^115Xcrpc].

> Let me consider combination therapy and sequencing, because severe cases often need more than one agent. A fibrate plus omega-3 fatty acids can be synergistic for triglyceride lowering, and adding a statin is appropriate when ASCVD risk is high. If a statin is used with a fibrate, fenofibrate is preferred over gemfibrozil to mitigate myopathy risk, and I should monitor liver enzymes and creatine kinase during initiation and dose changes [^1119xTS4] [^114rv7WJ] [^113NnYR7].

> I should confirm special populations and edge cases. In pregnancy, statins are avoided. Management centers on very low-fat diet, strict glycemic control if diabetic, and consideration of omega-3s or fibrates in specialist hands, with medium-chain triglycerides for caloric support. In familial chylomicronemia syndrome or refractory severe hypertriglyceridemia, apoC-III inhibitors such as volanesorsen or ANGPTL3 inhibition with evinacumab may be considered in specialized settings, and plasmapheresis is reserved for life-threatening pancreatitis refractory to medical therapy, not as first-line [^111Qv5zx] [^111Fwv74] [^116PZiSG] [^112E3Mnu].

> Hold on, I should verify the acute pancreatitis scenario and when to escalate beyond oral therapy. If acute hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis is present and triglycerides remain ≥ 1000 mg/dL despite conservative measures, insulin infusion with tight glycemic control can accelerate lipoprotein lipase activity and lower triglycerides, and in select refractory cases, therapeutic plasmapheresis may be used; routine heparin infusions are not recommended, and plasmapheresis should not be first-line outside of specialized indications [^111AU7b3] [^112E3Mnu].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm, but I will keep checking for internal consistency. For fasting triglycerides 500–999 mg/dL, prioritize lifestyle therapy, treat secondary causes, and add a fibrate or high-dose prescription omega-3 if levels persist; add a statin if ASCVD risk is ≥ 7.5% or if non-HDL-C remains above goal. For fasting triglycerides ≥ 1000 mg/dL, implement immediate very low-fat diet, address secondary causes urgently, and start a fibrate promptly; consider adding omega-3s and, if ASCVD risk is high, a statin once triglycerides are moving toward safer levels. Reassess fasting lipids in 4–8 weeks and titrate therapy to achieve and maintain triglycerides below 500 mg/dL, and ideally below 200 mg/dL when feasible, while monitoring liver enzymes, creatine kinase, and renal function as indicated [^1119xTS4] [^114JW9Hb] [^115bQ6AG].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought statins might be first-line even in severe hypertriglyceridemia because of their cardiovascular benefit, but I should correct that. Statins are not first-line for severe hypertriglyceridemia when the immediate priority is pancreatitis risk reduction; fibrates or high-dose omega-3s should lead, with statins layered in for ASCVD risk once triglycerides are safer and when risk calculators justify their use, which aligns with Endocrine Society and ACC/AHA guidance [^113VoWBc] [^114JW9Hb].

> I need to ensure I address monitoring and follow-up explicitly. Repeat a fasting lipid panel 4–8 weeks after initiating or changing therapy, then every 3–6 months once stable; monitor liver enzymes with fibrates and when combining with statins, assess creatine kinase if muscle symptoms occur, and check renal function periodically, adjusting fibrate dosing in chronic kidney disease; use non-HDL-C or apoB as secondary targets when LDL-C is unreliable due to high triglycerides [^115bQ6AG] [^1137stGA] [^111m77eV].

> Finally, I should double-check that I have highlighted evidence gaps and patient-centered considerations. Outcome data for triglyceride lowering to prevent pancreatitis are limited, so shared decision-making is essential. EPA-only has ASCVD outcome benefit in high-risk patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia on statins, but pancreatitis prevention data in severe hypertriglyceridemia are lacking, and EPA+DHA has not shown consistent cardiovascular benefit and may increase atrial fibrillation risk, reinforcing the need to tailor therapy to patient goals and risk profile [^111pXDdH] [^113ND9fZ] [^113nV2Rb].

The recommended treatment for severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL) is to **initiate a very low-fat diet** [^116TRXB8] and **start a fibrate** (preferably fenofibrate) [^1119xTS4] to rapidly lower triglycerides and reduce pancreatitis risk [^114rv7WJ]. If triglycerides remain ≥ 1000 mg/dL or if there is a history of pancreatitis, **add high-dose omega-3 fatty acids** (EPA 2–4 g/day) [^113ND9fZ] [^111Fwv74]. Statins are not first-line for severe hypertriglyceridemia [^1175wy8e] but should be added if ASCVD risk is high [^114rv7WJ] [^112Ks7ep]. Address secondary causes (diabetes, alcohol, medications) [^113yTaFD] and monitor lipids every 4–8 weeks [^115bQ6AG]; consider plasmapheresis only for life-threatening pancreatitis unresponsive to medical therapy [^111AU7b3].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle changes are **first-line** and essential to reduce triglycerides and pancreatitis risk [^1119xTS4].

- **Very low-fat diet**: < 15–20% of calories from fat; avoid saturated/trans fats, refined carbs, and alcohol [^116TRXB8] [^111Sadfk].

- **Weight loss**: Aim for 5–10% weight reduction in overweight/obese patients [^notfound].

- **Physical activity**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise [^notfound].

- **Alcohol avoidance**: Strict abstinence is critical, especially if TG ≥ 1000 mg/dL [^111Sadfk].

---

## Pharmacologic therapy

Pharmacotherapy is indicated when **lifestyle measures are insufficient** or TG are ≥ 1000 mg/dL.

---

### First-line pharmacologic therapy

Fibrates are **first-line** [^111iD8RL] because they lower TG by 30–50% and reduce pancreatitis risk [^113VoWBc]. Fenofibrate is preferred over gemfibrozil due to a lower myopathy risk when combined with statins [^112FkNUC].

---

### Second-line pharmacologic therapy

High-dose omega-3 fatty acids (EPA 2–4 g/day) [^113ND9fZ] lower TG by ~20–45% and are appropriate as add-on therapy or when fibrates are contraindicated [^114r4G34].

---

### Role of statins

Statins are **not first-line** for severe hypertriglyceridemia [^115Xcrpc] but should be added if ASCVD risk is high (≥ 7.5% 10-year risk) [^114rv7WJ] [^112Ks7ep]. They provide modest TG lowering (~10–30%) and cardiovascular risk reduction [^115Xcrpc].

---

## Management of acute hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis

In acute hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis, **insulin therapy** with intravenous insulin and dextrose is indicated when TG > 1000 mg/dL to rapidly lower TG [^111AU7b3]. Plasmapheresis is reserved for life-threatening pancreatitis unresponsive to medical therapy [^111AU7b3].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring ensures **adequate response** and guides therapy adjustments. Obtain fasting lipid panels every 4–8 weeks until TG are < 500 mg/dL, then every 3–6 months [^115bQ6AG]. Also assess liver and renal function periodically, especially with fibrates [^1149VgQu].

---

## Special considerations

- **Familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS)**: Consider apoC-III inhibitors (volanesorsen) or ANGPTL3 inhibitors (evinacumab) in refractory cases [^111Fwv74].

- **Pregnancy**: Avoid statins; use fibrates or omega-3s with caution and dietary fat restriction [^111Qv5zx].

- **Secondary causes**: Actively treat diabetes, hypothyroidism, and medication-induced hypertriglyceridemia [^113yTaFD].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Very low-fat diet | All patients | Reduce TG and pancreatitis risk |
| Fibrates (fenofibrate) | TG ≥ 500 mg/dL | First-line TG lowering |
| Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA) | TG ≥ 1000 mg/dL or add-on | Second-line TG lowering |
| Statins | High ASCVD risk | Cardiovascular risk reduction |
| Insulin therapy | Acute pancreatitis | Rapid TG lowering |
| Plasmapheresis | Refractory pancreatitis | Emergency TG lowering |

---

The cornerstone of management is a **very low-fat diet** [^116TRXB8] plus **fibrate therapy** [^113Ef1s8], with omega-3s and statins added as indicated, alongside aggressive management of secondary causes and close monitoring [^1119xTS4].

Severe hypertriglyceridemia management to prevent pancreatitis (IIa B-R; IIa B-NR): In adults 40 to 75 years of age with severe hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL [≥ 5.6 mmol/L]) and ASCVD risk of ≥ 7.5% or higher, it is reasonable to address reversible causes of high triglyceride and to initiate statin therapy; in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia, and especially fasting triglycerides ≥ 1000 mg/dL [11.3 mmol/L], it is reasonable to identify and address other causes and, if triglycerides are persistently elevated or increasing, to further reduce triglycerides by implementation of a very low-fat diet, avoidance of refined carbohydrates and alcohol, consumption of omega-3 fatty acids, and, if necessary to prevent acute pancreatitis, fibrate therapy. Statins alone cannot prevent increasing levels of triglycerides from triggering acute hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis.

Treatment of other lipoprotein fractions or targets

Severe hypertriglyceridemia may warrant immediate therapy of this abnormality with lifestyle and usually pharmacologic therapy (fibric acid derivative or niacin) to reduce the risk of acute pancreatitis. In the absence of severe hypertriglyceridemia, therapy targeting HDL cholesterol or triglycerides has intuitive appeal but lacks the evidence base of statin therapy. If the HDL cholesterol is < 40 mg/dl and the LDL cholesterol is between 100 and 129 mg/dl, gemfibrozil or niacin might be used, especially if a patient is intolerant to statins. Niacin is the most effective drug for raising HDL cholesterol. It can significantly increase blood glucose at high doses, but recent studies demonstrate that at modest doses (750–2,000 mg/day), significant improvements in LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels are accompanied by only modest changes in glucose that are generally amenable to adjustment of diabetes therapy.

Combination therapy, with a statin and a fibrate or a statin and niacin, may be efficacious for treatment for all three lipid fractions, but this combination is associated with an increased risk for abnormal transaminase levels, myositis, or rhabdomyolysis. The risk of rhabdomyolysis is higher with higher doses of statins and with renal insufficiency and seems to be lower when statins are combined with fenofibrate than gemfibrozil. Several ongoing trials may provide much-needed evidence for the effects of combination therapy on cardiovascular outcomes.

In 2008, a consensus panel convened by ADA and the American College of Cardiology recommended a greater focus on non-HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (apo B) in patients who are likely to have small LDL particles, such as people with diabetes. The consensus panel suggested that for statin-treated patients in whom the LDL cholesterol goal would be < 70 mg/dl (non-HDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dl), apo B should be measured and treated to < 80 mg/dl. For patients on statins with an LDL cholesterol goal of < 100 mg/dl (non-HDL cholesterol < 130 mg/dl), apo B should be measured and treated to below 90 mg/dl.

Table 11 summarizes the general recommendations for glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control for adults with diabetes.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia — definitions and risk context are summarized as follows: Two categories of hypertriglyceridemia consist of moderate hypertriglyceridemia (fasting or nonfasting triglycerides 175–499 mg/dL [2.0–5.6 mmol/L]) and severe hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL [≥ 5.6 mmol/L]). In the former, excess triglycerides are carried in very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), whereas in the latter most patients have elevated VLDL plus chylomicrons; VLDL are believed to be atherogenic, similar to low-density lipoprotein (LDL). With severe hypertriglyceridemia, elevations of VLDL raise risk of ASCVD, but increases in chylomicrons impart risk of acute pancreatitis, so therapies should address excesses in both lipoproteins. In pregnancy, in the setting of severe hypertriglyceridemia, statins are not part of the treatment regimen because they are not recommended at the present time in pregnancy.

Dietary therapy should be strongly emphasized as it remains the most poorly adherent triglyceride-lowering intervention.

### Recent advances in novel therapies for lipid disorders [^1123BZao]. Human Molecular Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of lipid disorders is alarmingly increasing in the Western world. They are the result of either primary causes, such as unhealthy lifestyle choices or inherited risk factors, or secondary causes like other diseases or medication. Atypical changes in the synthesis, processing and catabolism of lipoprotein particles may lead to severe hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia or elevated Lp(a). Although cholesterol-lowering drugs are the most prescribed medications, not all patients achieve guideline recommended cholesterol levels with the current treatment options, emphasising the need for new therapies. Also, some lipid disorders do not have any treatment options but rely only on stringent dietary restriction. Patients with untreated lipid disorders carry a severe risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and pancreatitis among others. To achieve better treatment outcome, novel selective gene expression and epigenetic targeting therapies are constantly being developed. Therapeutic innovations employing targeted RNA technology utilise small interfering RNAs, antisense oligonucleotides, long non-coding RNAs and microRNAs to regulate target protein production whereas viral gene therapy provides functional therapeutic genes and CRISPR/Cas technology relies on gene editing and transcriptional regulation. In this review, we will discuss the latest advances in clinical trials for novel lipid-lowering therapies and potential new targets in pre-clinical phase.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: algorithm for management of adults with dyslipidemia-2025 update [^111Fwv74]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Management of adults with hypertriglyceridemia — when fasting triglyceride (TG) levels are elevated, ie, > 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L), individuals with TG between 500 and 884 mg/dL (5.6–9.9 mmol/L) have increasing concern for metabolic deterioration predisposing to acute pancreatitis, for which secondary causes should be addressed, diets modified, and fibrates/omega-3 fatty acids initiated if levels do not improve. In those with a history of HTG-associated pancreatitis or with fasting TG remaining > 885 mg/dL (10 mmol/L) on repeat testing without an obvious and treatable secondary cause, treatment to protect against future pancreatitis episodes must be considered; first-line treatment includes a low-fat diet with strong consideration for a fibrate, and omega-3 fatty acids are also a consideration. For mild to moderate HTG (TG 150–499 mg/dL; 1.6–5.6 mmol/L), the primary concern is increased atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and the primary target must be low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C); in those with TG 500 to 884 mg/dL (5.6–9.9 mmol/L), ASCVD risk also warrants attention and other risk factors — hypertension, smoking, diabetes, and chronic stress — should be managed concurrently. If ASCVD risk is high or intermediate, medications with proven cardiovascular benefit, such as statins and ezetimibe, are preferred; when LDL-C is difficult to determine with persistently elevated TG on statin therapy, non–HDL-C and/or apolipoprotein B (ApoB) are alternative tests for treatment thresholds and monitoring. If ASCVD risk is low, lifestyle advice should be recommended with periodic lipid monitoring every 12 to 24 months, and statin treatment can be considered as the individual's situation evolves. For individuals with confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), clinicians may consider use of FDA-approved apolipoprotein CIII inhibitors, and access to investigational therapies for severe HTG can be explored through a specialty clinic.

### Hypertriglyceridemia: impact and treatment [^116vK6ST]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The treatment of elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is standard medical practice supported by conclusive outcome data. Less definitive information exists for hypertriglyceridemia. Only in the setting of severe hyperchylomicronemia is the benefit of triglyceride lowering clear: it is a means to reduce the risk of pancreatitis. The relationship of triglycerides and cardiovascular disease is still unclear. Moreover, the cardiovascular benefits of reducing triglycerides and of using triglyceride-lowering medications remain unproved. Nonetheless it has become almost standard to reduce the levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins that are a major component of plasma non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (management of hypertriglyceridemia), CCS/CPCA 2022 guidelines recommend to consider initiating pharmacotherapy in addition to strict dietary management, including omega-3 fatty acids or fibrates, and offering evaluation and management by a lipid specialist in patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia (2.3–5.5 mmol/L) despite lifestyle interventions or severe (> 5.5 mmol/L) hypertriglyceridemia at diagnosis.

A practical approach to hypertriglyceridemia

In any adult with newly recognized HTG, there are frequently contributing secondary causes (Table 7). Addressing these secondary causes often goes a long way toward correcting the HTG in many cases, and should be the first line of management (Fig. 4). In the patient with severe HTG, and a history of HTG-associated pancreatitis, or an individual whose fasting TG levels remain > 10 mmol/L (> 885 mg/dL) on repeat fasting lipid profiling, without an obvious and treatable secondary cause (eg, alcohol binge, decompensated diabetes) likely warrants treatment to protect against pancreatitis. The first-line drug treatment in these cases should be a fibrate.

For all others with mild to moderate HTG, the primary concern is the potential for excess ASCVD risk. ASCVD risk factors should be managed concurrently, such as hypertension, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, and diabetes. Medications with proven cardiovascular benefit, such as statins, ezetimibe, and icosapent ethyl, are preferred if pharmacological treatment is required, although paradoxically these are less effective at lowering TG levels than fibrates, for which evidence of ASCVD benefit is more tenuous. Because LDL-C may be impossible to determine in a statin-treated patient with persistently elevated TG, non-HDL-C, and/or apo B are alternative tests for treatment thresholds and for monitoring the effects of therapy.

For those with a history of HTG-associated pancreatitis, but who currently have only mild-to-moderate HTG, a case can still be made for treatment with a fibrate to reduce the future risk of pancreatitis. Mild-to-moderate TG elevation is a predictor of future risk of severe HTG and of development of pancreatitis.

Finally, for those at low cardiovascular risk, with TG levels below pancreatitis threshold, management of secondary contributors is the recommended course of action.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to management of dyslipidemia, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider identifying and addressing causes of hypertriglyceridemia in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL). Consider offering a very low-fat diet, avoidance of refined carbohydrates and alcohol, and consumption of omega-3 fatty acids to further reduce triglycerides in order to lower the risk of ASCVD events in patients with persistently elevated or increasing levels of triglycerides. Consider initiating fibrate therapy, if necessary, to prevent acute pancreatitis.

Hypertriglyceridemia

While the AHA/ACC/MS Guideline is identified as a guideline on the management of blood cholesterol, it also provides recommendations on the management of triglyceride disorders. It defines hypertriglyceridemia as a fasting level ≥ 2 mmol/L (175 mg/dL), which, if persistent on 3 determinations, is a risk‐enhancing factor favoring statin initiation in primary prevention patients 40 to 75 years of age with a 5% to 19.9% 10‐year ASCVD risk using the Pooled Cohort Equations. In patients with hypertriglyceridemia, the AHA/ACC/MS Guideline also suggests that apoB measurements may have advantages, especially in individuals with triglycerides ≥ 2.3 mmol/L (200 mg/dL). An apoB level ≥ 130 mg/dL constitutes a risk‐enhancing factor favoring initiation of a moderate‐intensity statin, or intensification of statin therapy in those already taking a moderate‐intensity statin (class IIa, B‐R). In those with severe hypertriglyceridemia of ≥ 5.7 mmol/L (500 mg/dL) and a 10‐year risk ≥ 7.5%, it is reasonable, after addressing possible secondary causes, to initiate a moderate‐ or high‐intensity statin (level IIa, B‐R). Further intensification of diet therapy and treatment with omega‐3 fatty acids or, if needed, fibrates should be considered in those with triglycerides ≥ 11.3 mmol/L (1000 mg/dL) to reduce the likelihood of acute pancreatitis (class IIa, B‐NR).

Regarding medical management for hypertriglyceridemia, more specifically with respect to general principles, AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA 2019 guidelines recommend to address and treat lifestyle factors (such as obesity and metabolic syndrome), secondary factors (such as diabetes mellitus, chronic liver or kidney disease and/or nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism), and medications that increase triglycerides in ≥ 20 years old adult patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia (fasting or nonfasting triglycerides 175–499 mg/dL; 2.0–5.6 mmol/L).

Hypertriglyceridemia in adults — For individuals with fasting triglyceride (TG) levels in the 500 to 884 mg/dL range, ASCVD prevention remains a priority, but attention should be given to the reduction of TG levels to decrease the individual's risk of HTG-induced acute pancreatitis; this is particularly true when TG levels reach the 885 to 1000 mg/dL threshold. Alcohol should be avoided in individuals with TG ≥ 500 mg/dL, and at TG ≥ 885 mg/dL the risk of pancreatitis rises substantially and will require a severe restriction in dietary fat intake. There should be an immediate restriction in dietary fat intake to < 15 to 20 grams per day; if this degree of reduction is needed to chronically maintain TGs < 885 mg/dL, medium-chain TGs (MCT) and essential fatty acid supplements can be added to the diet to avoid nutritional deficiencies. Effective implementation of lifestyle measures aimed at lowering TG will have a very noticeable effect in a short space of time (weeks). Most adults with TG levels ≥ 885 to 1000 mg/dL present with the polygenic form of the chylomicronemia syndrome (MCS) and retain partial or full LPL activity, and these individuals will be able to maintain TG levels < 250 mg/dL with addressing secondary factors, a moderate restriction of dietary fat (25–30% calories from fat, ideally < 40–50 grams of fat/day) and the use of TG-lowering medications; diets with fat content of ≤ 15 to 20 grams of fat per day are needed in individuals with persisting chylomicronemia who have FCS or a refractory form of MCS.

2.1 Prior to Initiation of TRICOR

- Assess lipid levels before initiating therapy. Identify other causes (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, or medications) of high TG levels and manage as appropriate.

- Patients should be placed on an appropriate lipid-lowering diet before receiving TRICOR, and should continue this diet during treatment with TRICOR.

- In patients with diabetes and fasting chylomicronemia, improve glycemic control prior to considering starting TRICOR.

2.2 Recommended Dosage and Administration

- **Severe hypertriglyceridemia**: ○ The recommended dosage of TRICOR is 48 mg or 145 mg orally once daily. ○ Dosage should be individualized according to patient response, and should be adjusted if necessary following repeat lipid determinations at 4 to 8 week intervals.

- **Primary hyperlipidemia**: ○ The recommended dosage of TRICOR is 145 mg orally once daily.

- Administer TRICOR as a single dose at any time of day, with or without food.

- Advise patients to swallow TRICOR tablets whole. Do not crush, break, dissolve, or chew tablets.

- Assess TG when clinically appropriate, as early as 4 to 8 weeks after initiating TRICOR. Discontinue TRICOR in patients who do not have an adequate response after 2 months of treatment.

- If a dose is missed, advise patients not to take an extra dose. Resume treatment with the next dose.

- Advise patients to take TRICOR at least 1 hour before or 4 hours to 6 hours after a bile acid binding resin to avoid impeding its absorption.

2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment

- Assess renal function prior to initiation of TRICOR and periodically thereafter [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- Treatment with TRICOR should be initiated at a dosage of 48 mg orally once daily in patients with mild to moderately impaired renal function (eGFR 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73m), and increased only after evaluation of the effects on renal function and TG levels at this dosage.

- TRICOR is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m), including those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and those receiving dialysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^113C8KDY]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Adolescents with metabolic syndrome.

With the increasing prevalence of obesity among adolescents, metabolic syndrome with associated dyslipidemia is becoming more common in this population. Lifestyle modification should be emphasized in this population, including adoption of a calorie-restricted diet with reduced intake of simple carbohydrates and saturated fats, adequate physical activity, and weight loss. If required, adequate management of hyperglycemia with metformin with or without insulin may lead to improvement in hypertriglyceridemia. High-dose omega 3 fatty acids may be the first-line pharmaceutical agent of choice if additional therapy is required to manage hypertriglyceridemia in this age group. Fibrates and/or statins may also be considered in select severe cases, usually under the guidance of a lipid specialist.

Management of patients with dyslipidemia

General principles for dyslipidemia management.

Clinical practice guidelines recommend LDL-C as the primary target of therapy to reduce ASCVD risk (Figs. 3–5). Treatment thresholds or targets for LDL-C are recommended for patients who are stratified into risk categories using risk algorithms such as the Framingham Risk Score. For instance, North American lipid guidelines advise that high-risk subjects with existing ASCVD or a statin-indicated condition such as diabetes, renal insufficiency, or FH should have lipid-lowering therapy intensified if LDL-C is > 1.8 mmol/L (> 70 mg/dL), with no lower limit for treatment. In contrast, European guidelines recommend a target LDL-C level < 1.4 mmol/L (< 54 mg/dL) for these patients. In all cases, intervention to reduce LDL-C includes lifestyle management and if necessary, pharmacologic therapies. Certain monogenic disorders, specifically FH, are associated with dramatically increased ASCVD risk, placing these individuals into the highest risk strata, and emphasizing the importance of making this diagnosis.

The Panel believes there is insufficient evidence to permit definition of targets for triglycerides or HDL-C for these high-risk patients. Instead, the Panel proposes that treatment should be tailored to the individual to achieve desirable levels below (for triglycerides or non-HDL-C) or above (for HDL-C) the recommended cut-offs (Box 6). The Panel acknowledges that other expert bodies recommend apo B as a secondary therapeutic target in hypertriglyceridaemic patients. but considers that the precise clinical yield of this approach has yet to be demonstrated. The Panel also recognizes the limitations of the current evidence base for fibrates, niacin, and omega-3 fatty acids, including the lack of hard outcome data for statin–niacin and statin–omega-3 fatty acid combination therapies. Clearly, there is a need for well-defined trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these therapeutic combinations in high-risk patients at LDL-C goal with elevated triglycerides and/or low HDL-C.

Treatment recommendations

Future guidelines should harmonize ACC/AHA treatment approaches with those of contemporary international guidelines. For example, the ESC recommendation that secondary prevention patients should target an LDL-C < 55 mg/dL is a more stringent goal than current ACC/AHA guidelines and should be considered. Of note, AHA/ACC guidelines and ACC ECDP rely mainly on randomized controlled trial evidence. The ESC guidelines emphasize randomized controlled trials but take into account the totality of evidence, including nonrandomized trials and epidemiologic studies. Therefore, the more aggressive recommendations are based on data beyond clinical outcome trials. In addition, patients with high plaque burden (CAC ≥ 300) should be treated to a similar LDL-C target. In alignment with ESC and CCS guidelines, PCSK9 inhibitors should be considered in treatment algorithms for high-risk primary prevention patients, not solely for secondary prevention or those with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

There is also merit in considering pharmacotherapy for low- and moderate-risk patients with persistently elevated LDL-C despite lifestyle modification. This recommendation is supported by data from the Cholesterol Lowering in Intermediate-Risk Persons without Cardiovascular Disease (HOPE-3) trialand recent imaging studies demonstrating early, yet reversible, plaque formation in patients with dyslipidemia. The forthcoming PRECAD (Prevent Coronary Artery Disease) trial will provide further insights into this issue.

The 2021 ACC ECDP on the Management of ASCVD Risk Reduction in Patients With Persistent Hypertriglyceridemia should also remain central to future guideline updates, particularly in light of the REDUCE (Cardiovascular Risk Reduction with Icosapent Ethyl for Hypertriglyceridemia) trial results, which were published after the 2018 guidelines. This trial established the benefit of icosapent ethyl, a highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ether derivative, in reducing cardiovascular risk in those with persistent hypertriglyceridemia. However, there has been controversy about the use of a mineral oil placebo in REDUCE-IT, and conflicting data from the STRENGTH (Effect of High-Dose Omega-3 Fatty Acids vs Corn Oil on Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Patients at High Cardiovascular Risk) trial, which used corn oil and a different omega-3 fatty acid preparation. Despite this, the ACC ECDP, ESC, and CCS recommend icosapent ethyl for residual hypertriglyceridemia. In addition, the ACC/AHA Cholesterol Guidelines should offer specific recommendations for managing individuals with elevated Lp(a), in line with recent National Lipid Association guidance, which advocates initiating or intensifying therapy in those with LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL.

Restriction of both saturated and unsaturated dietary fat, particularly at initiation of therapy and in LpL deficiency, assists in lowering triglyceride acutely, and design of the dietary intervention may benefit from input from nutrition specialists; regain of weight loss might exacerbate pancreatitis risk.

Objective

The aim was to develop clinical practice guidelines on hypertriglyceridemia.

Participants

The Task Force included a chair selected by The Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS), five additional experts in the field, and a methodologist. The authors received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence, e-mail discussion, conference calls, and one in-person meeting. The guidelines were reviewed and approved sequentially by The Endocrine Society's CGS and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members responding to a web posting, and The Endocrine Society Council. At each stage, the Task Force incorporated changes in response to written comments.

Conclusions

The Task Force recommends that the diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia be based on fasting levels, that mild and moderate hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides of 150–999 mg/dl) be diagnosed to aid in the evaluation of cardiovascular risk, and that severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides of > 1000 mg/dl) be considered a risk for pancreatitis. The Task Force also recommends that patients with hypertriglyceridemia be evaluated for secondary causes of hyperlipidemia and that subjects with primary hypertriglyceridemia be evaluated for family history of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease. The Task Force recommends that the treatment goal in patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia be a non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in agreement with National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel guidelines. The initial treatment should be lifestyle therapy; a combination of diet modification and drug therapy may also be considered. In patients with severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia, a fibrate should be used as a first-line agent.

Endocrine Society guideline — management of hypertriglyceridemia recommends lifestyle therapy, including dietary counseling to achieve appropriate diet composition, physical activity, and a program to achieve weight reduction in overweight and obese individuals as the initial treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia; for severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 1000 mg/dl), we recommend combining reduction of dietary fat and simple carbohydrate intake with drug treatment to reduce the risk of pancreatitis; we recommend that the treatment goal for patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia be a non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level in agreement with NCEP ATP guidelines; we recommend that a fibrate be used as a first-line agent for reduction of triglycerides in patients at risk for triglyceride-induced pancreatitis; we suggest that three drug classes (fibrates, niacin, n-3 fatty acids) alone or in combination with statins be considered as treatment options in patients with moderate to severe triglyceride levels; and we recommend that statins not be used as monotherapy for severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia, although statins may be useful for the treatment of moderate hypertriglyceridemia when indicated to modify cardiovascular risk.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113VoWBc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia — drug therapy for triglyceride lowering and pancreatitis risk: We recommend that a fibrate be used as a first-line agent for reduction of triglycerides in patients at risk for triglyceride-induced pancreatitis, and we suggest that three drug classes (fibrates, niacin, and n-3 fatty acids) alone or in combination with statins be considered as treatment options in patients with moderate to severe triglyceride levels. Three drug classes are clinically available for treatment of hypertriglyceridemia — fibrates, niacin, and n-3 fatty acids — and if the primary goal is to lower triglyceride levels, fibrates and perhaps n-3 fatty acids are best, whereas if the primary goal is to modify the size and density of LDL and HDL particles, niacin is best. Fibrates should be strongly considered in patients with severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia and should be considered in patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia; fibrates decrease triglyceride levels by 30–50% and sometimes increase HDL cholesterol, and in patients with high triglyceride levels LDL cholesterol levels may increase, whereas in mild hypertriglyceridemia LDL cholesterol levels may decrease. There is inconsistency in the evidence base for cardiovascular risk reduction using fibrates, the use of niacin is associated with significant side effects, and there are limited data on the use of n-3 fatty acids to reduce cardiovascular risk.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

2018 Cholesterol Clinical Practice Guideline — severe hypertriglyceridemia management states that most patients with triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL (≥ 5.6 mmol/L) have elevations of both VLDL and chylomicrons and that patients with triglycerides in the 500- to 999-mg/dL (5.6- to 11.2-mmol/L) range are at risk of developing unrecognized marked increases in triglycerides, leading to pancreatitis; to prevent acute pancreatitis, it is reasonable to reduce triglycerides whenever levels exceed 500 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) by addressing underlying factors, implementing a very low-fat diet, and adding fibrates or omega-3 fatty acids for persistently elevated severe hypertriglyceridemia; if a fibrate is necessary in a patient being treated with a statin, it is safer to use fenofibrate than gemfibrozil because of lower risk of severe myopathy, and severe or life-threatening hypertriglyceridemia during pregnancy is best managed in consultation with a lipid specialist.

### Management of hypertriglyceridemia: common questions and answers [^111AU7b3]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia, defined as fasting serum triglyceride levels of 150 mg per dL or higher, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Severely elevated triglyceride levels (500 mg per dL or higher) increase the risk of pancreatitis. Common risk factors for hypertriglyceridemia include obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Less common risk factors include excessive alcohol use, physical inactivity, being overweight, use of certain medications, and genetic disorders. Management of high triglyceride levels (150 to 499 mg per dL) starts with dietary changes and physical activity to lower cardiovascular risk. Lowering carbohydrate intake (especially refined carbohydrates) and increasing fat (especially omega-3 fatty acids) and protein intake can lower triglyceride levels. Moderate- to high-intensity physical activity can lower triglyceride levels, as well as improve body composition and exercise capacity. Calculating a patient's 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is pertinent to determine the role of medications. Statins can be considered for patients with high triglyceride levels who have borderline (5% to 7.4%) or intermediate (7.5% to 19.9%) risk. For patients at high risk who continue to have high triglyceride levels despite statin use, high-dose icosapent (purified eicosapentaenoic acid) can reduce cardiovascular mortality (number needed to treat = 111 to prevent one cardiovascular death over five years). Fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, or niacin should be considered for patients with severely elevated triglyceride levels to reduce the risk of pancreatitis, although this has not been studied in clinical trials. For patients with acute pancreatitis associated with hypertriglyceridemia, insulin infusion and plasmapheresis should be considered if triglyceride levels remain at 1,000 mg per dL or higher despite conservative management of acute pancreatitis.

### Pharmacologic approaches for the management of patients with moderately elevated triglycerides (150–499 mg / dL) [^113W7PjX]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia, defined as serum triglyceride (TG) levels > 150 mg/dL, now affects over one-quarter of the US adult population and is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Available guidelines for managing hypertriglyceridemia vary with respect to TG thresholds and severity of disease. Lifestyle modifications and management of secondary causes (eg, diabetes) remain the first step in managing hypertriglyceridemia, with pharmacotherapy reserved to reduce the risk of pancreatitis and/or further reduce TG levels. Several classes of lipid-lowering agents are available with variable TG-lowering efficacy. Although there is no consensus regarding the choice of initial TG-lowering pharmacotherapy, there is general agreement that the decision depends on the degree of hypertriglyceridemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. This review will discuss available and emerging lipid-lowering therapies for the management of moderately elevated TG, defined as TG 150 to 499 mg/dL.

Recommendation 1.3 — lipoprotein testing in hypertriglyceridemia states: We recommend against the routine measurement of lipoprotein particle heterogeneity in patients with hypertriglyceridemia (1⊕⊕⊕○). We suggest that measurement of apoB or Lp(a) levels can be of value, whereas measurement of other apolipoprotein levels has little clinical value (2⊕⊕○○). Supporting evidence notes it is not necessary to measure LDL size or density; however, measurement of non-HDL cholesterol and/or apoB levels can indicate the presence of increased numbers of LDL particles, and several reports also show that measurement of apoB is superior to measurement of LDL or even non-HDL cholesterol as an indicator of global CVD risk. Epidemiologic studies have not provided conclusive evidence that measurement of HDL size contributes to risk prediction, and for these reasons, assessment of lipoprotein heterogeneity is not recommended in the assessment of hypertriglyceridemia. Regarding Lp(a), studies over the past decade have confirmed and more robustly demonstrated a risk factor role for cardiovascular disease; however, there are limited treatment options to alter its level and a current lack of outcome evidence supporting its use as a specific therapeutic target.

ACC 2021 persistent fasting hypertriglyceridemia 500–999 mg/dL — management includes emphasizing a low-fat diet and that it is reasonable to consider a very low-fat diet in select patients, with consideration of fibrate or prescription omega-3 fatty acids to reduce risk of pancreatitis; for the right-column pathway, actions also include to increase intensity of statin therapy and optimize statin adherence while continuing the same diet and triglyceride-lowering options. Fenofibrate is specified as the preferred fibrate due to safety and interaction profile, and the narrative notes it is reasonable to further reduce triglycerides by implementation of a very-low-fat diet (10% to 15%), avoidance of refined carbohydrates and alcohol, and prescription omega-3. The text also states that the initial step in guideline-based management of severe hypertriglyceridemia is to provide lifestyle counseling.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^112u5Cuj]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

HIV-associated hypertriglyceridemia — measurement and treatment thresholds and drug considerations: TG must be determined in a fasting state, and repeated values ≥ 500 mg/dL that are unresponsive to lifestyle interventions should be treated with medications. Statins have a moderate effect on TG; fibrates, prescription omega-3 fatty acids, and niacin are frequently used pharmacologic therapies for very high TG. In patients with hypertriglyceridemia ≥ 500 mg/dL, fibrates and certain omega-3 fatty acid preparations (those that contain DHA) may raise LDL-C. Niacin is generally the least well tolerated of the drugs that primarily lower TG and TG-rich lipoproteins, and high doses are necessary to achieve significant TG-lowering; it also has the potential to induce insulin resistance and new-onset diabetes mellitus, thus it is generally reserved for patients that do not tolerate a fibrate or prescription omega-3 fatty acid agent.

### Management of severe hypertriglyceridemia in the hospital: a review [^1139NVfR]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

For hospitalists, hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is more than cardiovascular risk. Severe HTG occurs when serum triglycerides rise above 1000 mg/dL, and it carries a risk of abdominal pain and pancreatitis. The etiology of severe HTG is usually a combination of genetic and secondary factors. A detailed history with attention to family history, medications, and alcohol consumption can often lead to the cause. Physical examination findings may stretch across multiple organ systems. Patients with severe HTG should be admitted to the hospital for aggressive medical therapy if they develop symptoms such as abdominal pain or pancreatitis. Asymptomatic patients with severe HTG who have significant short-term risk for developing symptoms require urgent consultation that may lead to a brief hospitalization to address exacerbating factors. Treatment of severe HTG includes a combination of pharmacologic agents and a restriction on dietary triglyceride intake. If oral medications fail to adequately lower triglyceride levels, intravenous insulin and in rare cases therapeutic plasma exchange may be required. To prevent recurrent severe HTG, the patient should be counseled about adherence to long-term medications and lifestyle changes.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for the management of hypertriglyceridemia: a science advisory from the American Heart Association [^113ND9fZ]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides 200–499 mg/dL) is relatively common in the United States, whereas more severe triglyceride elevations (very high triglycerides, ≥ 500 mg/dL) are far less frequently observed. Both are becoming increasingly prevalent in the United States and elsewhere, likely driven in large part by growing rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus. In a 2002 American Heart Association scientific statement, the omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were recommended (at a dose of 2–4 g/d) for reducing triglycerides in patients with elevated triglycerides. Since 2002, prescription agents containing EPA+DHA or EPA alone have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating very high triglycerides; these agents are also widely used for hypertriglyceridemia. The purpose of this advisory is to summarize the lipid and lipoprotein effects resulting from pharmacological doses of n-3 FAs (> 3 g/d total EPA+DHA) on the basis of new scientific data and availability of n-3 FA agents. In treatment of very high triglycerides with 4 g/d, EPA+DHA agents reduce triglycerides by ≥ 30% with concurrent increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, whereas EPA-only did not raise low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in very high triglycerides. When used to treat hypertriglyceridemia, n-3 FAs with EPA+DHA or with EPA-only appear roughly comparable for triglyceride lowering and do not increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when used as monotherapy or in combination with a statin. In the largest trials of 4 g/d prescription n-3 FA, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were modestly decreased, indicating reductions in total atherogenic lipoproteins. The use of n-3 FA (4 g/d) for improving atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in patients with hypertriglyceridemia is supported by a 25% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events With EPA Intervention Trial), a randomized placebo-controlled trial of EPA-only in high-risk patients treated with a statin. The results of a trial of 4 g/d prescription EPA+DHA in hypertriglyceridemia are anticipated in 2020. We conclude that prescription n-3 FAs (EPA+DHA or EPA-only) at a dose of 4 g/d (> 3 g/d total EPA+DHA) are an effective and safe option for reducing triglycerides as monotherapy or as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering agents.

In patients with diabetes and fasting chylomicronemia, improve glycemic control prior to considering starting Antara.

2.2 Recommended Dosage and Administration

- **Severe hypertriglyceridemia**: ○ The recommended dosage of Antara is 30 mg or 90 mg orally once daily. ○ Dosage should be individualized according to patient response, and should be adjusted if necessary following repeat lipid determinations at 4 to 8 week intervals.
- **Primary hyperlipidemia**: ○ The recommended dosage of Antara is 90 mg orally once daily.
- Administer Antara as a single dose at any time of day, with or without food.
- Advise patients to swallow Antara capsules whole. Do not crush, break, dissolve, or chew capsules.
- Assess TG when clinically appropriate, as early as 4 to 8 weeks after initiating Antara. Discontinue Antara in patients who do not have an adequate response after two months of treatment.
- If a dose is missed, advise patients not to take an extra dose. Resume treatment with the next dose.
- Advise patients to take Antara at least 1 hour before or 4 hours to 6 hours after a bile acid binding resin to avoid impeding its absorption.

2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment

Assess renal function prior to initiation of Antara and periodically thereafter [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
Treatment with Antara should be initiated at a dosage of 30 mg orally once daily in patients with mild to moderately impaired renal function (eGFR 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73m), and increased only after evaluation of the effects on renal function and TG levels at this dose.
Antara is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/ 1.73m), including those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and those receiving dialysis [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]

2.4 Recommended Dosage in Geriatric Patients

Dosage selection for the elderly should be made on the basis of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115Xcrpc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society hypertriglyceridemia — statin recommendation and evidence: "We recommend that statins not be used as monotherapy for severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia. However, statins may be useful for the treatment of moderate hypertriglyceridemia when indicated to modify cardiovascular risk (1/⊕⊕○○)". Statins have a modest triglyceride-lowering effect, typically about 10–15%, with high-dose regimens such as atorvastatin 80 mg or rosuvastatin 40 mg lowering plasma triglyceride by 25–30%. Statin monotherapy should not be first-line therapy in severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 1000 mg/dl), while addition of statins can be considered to reduce cardiovascular risk in mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia (> 150 mg/dl and < 1000 mg/dl) with elevated non-HDL cholesterol. Adverse effects occur in about 5–10% of patients, muscle symptoms occur in about 10% of patients, and conditions predisposing to severe myopathy include advanced age, renal failure, polypharmacy, and acute illness.

### Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, fibrates and niacin as therapeutic options in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: a review of the literature [^111Dk1sF]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia affects approximately 33% of the US population. Elevated triglyceride levels are independently associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, and severe hypertriglyceridemia is a risk factor for acute pancreatitis. Guidelines for the management of severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 5.6 mmol/L [≥ 500 mg/dL]) recommend immediate use of triglyceride-lowering agents; however, statins remain the first line of therapy for the management of mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia (1.7–5.6 mmol/L [150–499 mg/dL]). Statins primarily target elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, but have also been shown to reduce mean triglyceride levels by up to 18% (or 43% in patients with triglyceride levels ≥ 3.1 mmol/L [≥ 273 mg/dL]). However, individuals with hypertriglyceridemia may need additional reduction in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and remnant particles to further reduce residual CVD risk. A number of guidelines recommend the addition of fibrates, niacin, or long-chain omega-3 fatty acids if elevated triglyceride or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels persist despite the use of high-intensity statin therapy. This review evaluates the impact of fibrates, niacin, and long-chain omega-3 fatty acids on lipid profiles and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. It also assesses the adverse effects and drug-drug interactions associated with these triglyceride-lowering agents, because although they have all been shown to effectively reduce triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, they differ with regard to their associated benefit-risk profiles. Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids may be a well-tolerated and effective alternative to fibrates and niacin, yet further large-scale clinical studies are required to evaluate their effects on cardiovascular outcomes and CVD risk reduction in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia — adults aged 40 to 75 years: In adults 40 to 75 years of age with moderate or severe hypertriglyceridemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk of 7.5% or higher, it is reasonable to reevaluate ASCVD risk after lifestyle and secondary factors are addressed and to consider a persistently elevated triglyceride level as a factor favoring initiation or intensification of statin therapy. In adults 40 to 75 years of age with severe hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL [≥ 5.6 mmol/L]) and ASCVD risk of 7.5% or higher, it is reasonable to address reversible causes of high triglyceride and to initiate statin therapy. In adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL [≥ 5.7 mmol/L], and especially fasting triglycerides ≥ 1000 mg/dL [11.3 mmol/L]), it is reasonable to identify and address other causes of hypertriglyceridemia, and if triglycerides are persistently elevated or increasing, to further reduce triglycerides by implementation of a very low-fat diet, avoidance of refined carbohydrates and alcohol, consumption of omega-3 fatty acids, and, if necessary to prevent acute pancreatitis, fibrate therapy.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112anW1F]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia severity thresholds and clinical implications: Moderate hypertriglyceridemia, i.e., 200–999 mg/dl, is due to excess circulating VLDL. In patients with severe or very severe triglyceride levels (≥ 1000 mg/dl), the LpL removal system is saturated, and triglyceride levels above 1000 mg/dl can rapidly increase after a fat-rich meal. Very severe triglyceride levels (> 2000 mg/dl) are associated with lipemic serum and risk of pancreatitis in the chylomicronemia syndrome. Foods that contain potent substrates for triglyceride production such as simple sugars, fructose, and alcohol can substantially increase triglyceride levels in susceptible people.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^113C6sUg]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment "targets" vs "thresholds".

Cholesterol recommendations from major guideline organizations differ in several aspects, despite each committee being composed of lipid experts, and evaluating essentially the same evidence. A major difference is the LDL-C level at which treatment intensification is recommended. Some guideline organizations (ie, European Atherosclerosis Society/European Society of Cardiology) have opted for a treatment "target", which varies based on guideline organization, and some for a treatment "intensification threshold" (ie, Canadian Cardiovascular Society). The difference is subtle but important. A target level implies that maximal benefit is obtained once the target is attained and may lead to providers possibly back-titrating the dose or even deprescribing medication if the attained level is far below the target. However, most clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering agents were performed by selecting patients with LDL-C exceeding a threshold value, and did not aim for a specific target level: some on-treatment patients attained extremely low LDL-C levels and yet continued to show benefit with respect to ASCVD risk reduction. Advocates for thresholds suggest that these closely approximate the approach used in the clinical trials, and are thus consistent with "evidence-based medicine".

### Clinical review on triglycerides [^112n34Lp]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hypertriglyceridaemia is a common clinical problem. Epidemiologic and genetic studies have established that triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) and their remnants as important contributors to ASCVD while severe hypertriglyceridaemia raises risk of pancreatitis. While low-density lipoprotein is the primary treatment target for lipid lowering therapy, secondary targets that reflect the contribution of TRL such as apoB and non-HDL-C are recommended in the current guidelines. Reduction of severely elevated triglycerides is important to avert or reduce the risk of pancreatitis. Here we discuss interventions for hypertriglyceridaemia, including diet and lifestyle, established treatments such as fibrates and omega-3 fatty acid preparations and emerging therapies, including various biological agents.

### Clinical considerations for the management of… [^116zUbsT]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

1 A low-carbohydrate diet is also a good strategy for managing hypertriglyceridemia. However, it should not be a universal recommendation in patients with triglyceride levels greater than 500 mg per dL because some of these patients may have familial chylomicronemia syndrome, a rare genetic disorder where loss-of-function mutations limit the ability to effectively break down triglycerides. Instead of a low-carbohydrate diet, patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome should be placed on a very low-fat diet. This diagnosis should be considered in patients with triglyceride levels greater than 1, 000 mg per dL without an obvious secondary cause; occurrence at a young age; and debilitating physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms.

2 Intensive therapies such as insulin infusions, plasmapheresis, or parenteral heparin are not standard care or sufficiently supported by the literature to recommend their use; these therapies also carry substantial risks and expense. As mentioned by Dr. Oh and colleagues, expert consultation is required in these cases. 3 Additionally, we disagree that there are no data demonstrating cardiovascular risk reduction with hypertriglyceridemia treatment. Although no individual trial has met this primary end point, meta-analyses have consistently demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular risk from triglyceride-lowering therapies. 4–6. 1 For patients with significant hypertriglyceridemia leading to acute pancreatitis, we suggest that other medications be considered to reduce pancreatitis-associated morbidity and mortality. Insulin has been successfully used in the hospital setting and is supported in the literature.

2, 3 Physicians without experience using insulin and other intensive therapies for this indication should consult an expert. Reduction of refined carbohydrates, including sucrose and fructose, is critical in the management of familial chylomicronemia syndrome because of their conversion in the liver to triglycerides. A diet lower in refined carbohydrates, higher in lean protein, and lower in fat can be an option for patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome. 5 REDUCE-IT is the first study of its kind, demonstrating a reduction of mortality in high-risk patients who have elevated triglycerides despite statin therapy. However, another similarly designed study did not show benefit. 6 Additionally, drug therapy should always be the last resort. The most cost-effective therapy is a healthy diet, physical activity, and nonpharmaceutical interventions to lower cardiovascular risk.

Treatment of hypertriglyceridemia — AHA/ASA secondary stroke prevention guideline: In patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) who have fasting triglycerides 135 to 499 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of 41 to 100 mg/dL while on moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy, with HbA1c < 10% and no history of pancreatitis, atrial fibrillation (AF), or severe heart failure, treatment with icosapent ethyl (IPE) 2 g twice a day is reasonable to reduce risk of recurrent stroke (COR 2a, LOE B-R). In patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (ie, fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL [≥ 5.7 mmol/L]), it is reasonable to identify and address causes and, if triglycerides remain elevated or are increasing, to further reduce triglycerides by implementation of a very low-fat diet, avoidance of refined carbohydrates and alcohol, consumption of omega 3 fatty acids, and, if necessary to prevent acute pancreatitis, fibrate therapy (COR 2a, LOE B-NR).

Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA ± DHA) — For adults with hypertriglyceridemia (150–499 mg/dL) who have CVD or are at increased risk for CVD and are taking statins, the task force issued a conditional recommendation for the use of EPA after shared decision-making because EPA monotherapy results in a small reduction in MI with some potential adverse effects, whereas in the same population it issued a conditional recommendation against EPA plus DHA due to trivial benefits and moderate adverse effects. Recommendations are grounded in trials evaluating doses of ≥ 1.8 g/day, approaching recommended prescribing doses in the range of 2 to 4 g/day, and should not be applied to doses < 1.8 g/day. For severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL), the task force notes a paucity of evidence and advises shared decision-making when considering EPA monotherapy or EPA plus DHA; no studies evaluated the prevention of pancreatitis in persons with severe hypertriglyceridemia.

Main

sHTG is a well-established risk factor for acute pancreatitis (AP) and is considered causal in 10% of cases. The 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol define severe hypertriglyceridemia as ≥ 500 mg dL −1. Similarly, the National Lipid Association defines very-high triglycerides (highest classification possible) as ≥ 500 mg dL −1 (refs.). Furthermore, within the US Food and Drug Administration prescribing information of triglyceride-lowering drugs, sHTG is commonly defined as ≥ 500 mg dL −1. In the United States, the prevalence of sHTG (≥ 500 mg dL −1) is reported to be 1.7%. In a retrospective cohort study including US adults (n = 7,119,195), the overall annualized incidence rate of AP was 0.08% and increased with increasing triglyceride levels (0.07%, triglycerides < 200 mg dL −1; 1.21%, triglycerides > 1,000 mg dL −1). Furthermore, for example, for patients with one or ≥ 2 AP events at baseline, the overall annualized incidence rate of AP was found to increase to 10.16% and 29.98%, respectively. Patients with sHTG-related AP often have recurrent attacks requiring repeat hospital admissions and have worse outcomes than non-hypertriglyceridemia-related AP, including an increased odds ratio for chronic morbidity and mortality.

### Investigation and management of hypertriglyceridaemia [^1139s6tz]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

While the precise definition of hypertriglyceridaemia remains contentious, the condition is becoming more common in western populations as the prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus rise. Although there is strong epidemiological evidence that hypertriglyceridaemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, it is has been difficult to demonstrate this by drug intervention studies, as drugs that reduce triglycerides also raise high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Precise target values have also been difficult to agree, although several of the new guidelines for coronary risk management now include triglycerides. The causes of hypertriglyceridaemia are numerous. The more severe forms have a genetic basis, and may lead to an increased risk of pancreatitis. Several types of hypertriglyceridaemia are familial and are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Secondary causes of hypertriglyceridaemia are also numerous and it is important to exclude these before starting treatment with specific triglyceride-lowering agents. Lifestyle management is also very effective and includes weight reduction, restricted alcohol and fat intake and exercise.

### Treatment options for the management of hypertriglyceridemia: strategies based on the best-available evidence [^115F7sgQ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2012). Low credibility.

A severe elevation in triglycerides (TG; ≥ 500 mg/dL) increases the risk for pancreatitis. TG levels ≥ 200 mg/dL are associated with a greater risk of atherosclerotic coronary heart disease (CHD). However, no outcomes trials exist to assess the efficacy of TG lowering for preventing pancreatitis in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Similarly, no completed prospective outcomes trial exists to support or refute a reduction in CHD risk resulting from lipid-altering therapy in patients specifically selected for the presence of hypertriglyceridemia. This review examines the available evidence for the use of statins, omega-3 fatty acids, fibrates, and niacin in the management of hypertriglyceridemic patients. Results from CHD outcomes trials support statins as the first-line lipid-altering drug therapy to reduce CHD in hypercholesterolemic patients, and subgroup analyses suggest statins are efficacious in hypertriglyceridemic patients with fasting TG levels < 500 mg/dL. Omega-3 fatty acids and fibrates are reasonable first drug options for patients with TG ≥ 500 mg/dL and often are used to lower TG levels with the objective of reducing pancreatitis risk, although a statin or niacin may also be reasonable options. Combination lipid drug therapy may be needed to achieve both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol treatment goals for CHD prevention in patients with elevated TG levels, particularly those with TG ≥ 500 mg/dL. Additional clinical outcomes data are needed to provide a more evidence-based rationale for clinical lipid management of hypertriglyceridemic patients.

Summary of recommendations

Based on current evidence, this expert consensus provides structured recommendations for the diagnosis, classification, screening, and management of FPLD. The following summary consolidates key recommendations to assist clinicians in diagnosing and optimizing care for individuals with FPLD:
The effective management of FPLD necessitates early clinical suspicion, comprehensive screening for multisystem complications, and implementation of individualized treatment strategies tailored to the genetic subtype and clinical severity of the condition.
Clinical suspicion should be heightened in patients exhibiting peripheral lipoatrophy, especially when it is concomitant with metabolic abnormalities, such as hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance, MASLD, or early onset cardiovascular disease.
The diagnostic process relies on clinical criteria, anthropometric assessments, laboratory evaluations, and genetic testing when accessible.
All patients with FPLD should undergo regular metabolic screening including lipid profiling, glycemic status, and liver function tests.
Cardiovascular screening with electrocardiogram and echocardiogram is particularly important in patients with LMNA pathogenic variants, given the higher risk of dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and conduction abnormalities. Holter monitoring may also be considered, particularly for LMNA non-482 variants, to detect subclinical rhythmic disturbances. Screening for subclinical atherosclerosis may be individualized based on clinical risk factors.
Non-invasive techniques, such as transient elastography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), should be employed for the assessment of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, with periodic re-evaluation contingent upon clinical risk factors.
Central to the treatment strategy are lifestyle interventions that should encompass a personalized hypocaloric diet and a structured exercise regimen that incorporates both aerobic and resistance training. Nutritional modifications must account for the heightened risk of hypertriglyceridemia and the potential for MASLD even in individuals who do not have obesity.
Metformin continues to be the first agent for glycemic management. Nevertheless, in instances of significant insulin resistance, GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, or insulin should be considered. Thiazolidinediones may provide particular advantages for patients with FPLD3 owing to their effects on PPARG. Tirzepatide should be considered as an effective treatment for metabolic Aimprovement of diabetes, insulin resistance and related complications. Dyslipidemia should be addressed with high-intensity statins and ezetimibe, whereas fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids are recommended for severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL).
Advanced therapies may be considered for selected patients. Metreleptin could be an option for individuals with poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c level > 8.0%) and/or severe hypertriglyceridemia, particularly when conventional therapies fail. Similarly, volanesorsen may be considered in cases of severe hypertriglyceridemia with a high risk of pancreatitis that is unresponsive to standard lipid-lowering treatments.
The use of metreleptin and volanesorsen might be considered subsequent to optimisation with standard antidiabetic and lipid-lowering therapies, if available, in the context of cost and risk–benefit evaluation, as the current evidence supporting their efficacy is based on small clinical trials with limited sample sizes and follow-up periods.
Genetic counseling plays a crucial role and should be offered to all patients with confirmed or suspected genetic forms of FPLD. It enables informed decision-making regarding family planning, risk communication, and testing strategies. Following a confirmed diagnosis, cascade genetic screening of first-degree relatives is strongly recommended to identify asymptomatic carriers or undiagnosed cases and to enable early monitoring and intervention.
It is imperative to consider the specific monitoring nuances for each subtype. Patients with FPLD2 require intensive cardiovascular follow-up owing to an elevated risk of cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias. Patients with FPLD3 require close hepatic monitoring owing to a higher prevalence of MASLD and more severe metabolic abnormalities. For FPLD1 and FPLD X, individualized follow-up is essential, contingent upon the severity of metabolic derangements.
Women with FPLD, especially those with FPLD2 and FPLD3, require high-risk prenatal care, given the increased risk of obstetric complications, and contraceptive strategies should avoid oral estradiol formulations.
Psychological support should be integrated into routine care to address the emotional and social impact of FPLD, particularly body image disturbances and stigma.
Early diagnosis, comprehensive multidisciplinary management, personalized therapeutic strategies, and proactive genetic counseling are critical for improving the outcomes and quality of life in patients with FPLD.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^1135ETkY]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia — drug therapy selection by triglyceride level — states that when drug therapy is indicated, an agent that primarily lowers triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) (fibric acids, high-dose [2–4 g/d] long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, or nicotinic acid) should be the first-line agent if the fasting triglyceride concentration is ≥ 1000 mg/dL. For patients with triglycerides of 500 to 999 mg/dL, a triglyceride-lowering agent or a statin (if no history of pancreatitis) may be reasonable first-line drug options. For patients with high triglycerides (200–499 mg/dL), a statin will generally be first-line drug therapy, and if maximum tolerated statin therapy does not lower non–HDL-C below goal levels in patients with triglycerides 200 to 499 mg/dL, adding an agent that primarily lowers triglycerides and VLDL-C may help to achieve atherogenic cholesterol goals. Subgroup analyses from cardiovascular outcome studies provide suggestive evidence of reduced ASCVD event risk with the addition of a triglyceride-lowering agent to statin therapy, particularly in patients with the combination of elevated triglycerides and low HDL-C.

### Elevated plasma triglyceride concentration and risk of adverse clinical outcomes in 1.5 million people: a CALIBER linked electronic health record study [^111dAAoS]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinically, our findings provide insight into the serious health risks associated with both moderate and severe hypertriglyceridemia, especially in younger patients. Our continuous trait analysis identifies that the risk of adverse outcomes, especially for acute pancreatitis increases exponentially once triglycerides are just moderately elevated. This finding potentially challenges current treatment thresholds, while supporting guidelines advocating intervention at lower triglyceride concentrations. Further, our findings support measurement of triglycerides for cardiovascular risk management, if only as a marker of TGRLs, for which emerging therapies may provide cardiovascular benefit. Finally, unlike many studies on triglycerides our findings represent "real world" association analyses, with patients who have treated and untreated lipids and various comorbidities. As such the findings are more generalizable but could also explain why some estimates may differ from more bespoke studies.

In conclusion, we show in over 1.5 M people that moderate and severe triglyceride elevation is associated with risk of AP and CP, new onset diabetes, and death, but for MI only moderate hypertriglyceridemia is associated with risk. Of note, these risks are continuous and start at modest elevations of triglyceride concentrations, are higher in younger people and current drugs may have limited impact for reducing these risks from severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia. We anticipate these findings will support clinical interpretation of triglyceride concentrations, decisions for investigation and treatment, and cost effectiveness analyses for emerging triglyceride lowering therapies.

Brief review of cholesterol guidelines

The management of hypercholesterolemia has undergone significant evolution since the first major U.S. national cholesterol guidelines were introduced in 1988. This progress has been driven by the advent of statin therapy and numerous clinical trials demonstrating substantial reductions in cardiovascular events. A brief review of the most recent international guidelines is essential. These include the 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) multisociety guidelines, with subsequent updates reflected in the 2021 and 2022 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathways (ECDPs) on hypertriglyceridemiaand nonstatin therapies, respectively; the 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines; and the 2021 Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) guidelines. Table 2, provides an overview of the guidelines.

Table 2
Comparison of Recent International Cholesterol Statements

Two of the most significant differences across these guidelines are the approach to risk classification and treatment.

The AHA/ACC and CCS guidelines make an initial distinction between primary and secondary prevention; the AHA/ACC guidelines also separately provide recommendations for those with diabetes and severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL). In contrast, the ESC guidelines delineate patients from those with established ASCVD to those with low-calculate 10-year risk; however the guideline does make note of primary and secondary prevention in discussions of treatment.

In regard to treatment and nonstatin use, the ESC overall is more aggressive in LDL-C treatment thresholds and recommends LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL for all secondary and very-high-risk primary prevention patients. In contrast, the AHA/ACA guidelines reserve this for very-high-risk secondary prevention patients. Similarly, treating to LDL-C ≤ 70 mg/dL is recommended for a wide group of patients in ESC guidance.

In terms of therapeutic options, the biggest divergence is on the use of PCSK9 inhibitors. These are recommended for secondary and select primary prevention patients in ESC guidelinesalthough it is noteworthy that evidence of benefit in nonsecondary prevention and non-FH patients is lacking although clinical trials are ongoing. In contrast, use is limited in the ACC ECDP to secondary-prevention patients and those with likely FH.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111iD8RL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society hypertriglyceridemia guideline — diagnosis, risk categories, evaluation, and initial treatment recommends that the diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia be based on fasting levels, that mild and moderate hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides of 150–999 mg/dl) be diagnosed to aid in the evaluation of cardiovascular risk, and that severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides of > 1000 mg/dl) be considered a risk for pancreatitis; it also recommends that patients with hypertriglyceridemia be evaluated for secondary causes of hyperlipidemia and that subjects with primary hypertriglyceridemia be evaluated for family history of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease, and recommends that in moderate hypertriglyceridemia the treatment goal be a non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in agreement with National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel guidelines; the initial treatment should be lifestyle therapy, a combination of diet modification and drug therapy may also be considered, and in severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia a fibrate should be used as a first-line agent.

### Approach to the patient with moderate hypertriglyceridemia [^117BhF6u]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is a common lipid disorder encountered in clinical practice. Plasma triglycerides are a marker for the concentration of triglycerides carried in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoprotein particles. A fasting triglyceride level < 150 mg/dL is accepted widely as the upper limit of normal range. Guidelines for hypertriglyceridemia are variable without a global consensus on classification and goals for triglyceride levels. A general classification of hypertriglyceridemia is mild < 200 mg/dL, moderate = 200 to 500 mg/dL, moderate to severe = 500 to 1000 mg/dL, and severe > 1000 mg/dL. Because moderate hypertriglyceridemia does increase atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, it is important to determine the underlying etiology to guide appropriate and timely management. This article provides stepwise recommendations on the diagnosis and management of moderate hypertriglyceridemia, based on 3 common scenarios encountered in clinical practice. Initial steps in management include evaluating for secondary contributors, especially diabetes mellitus. Based on patient characteristics, appropriate management decisions include lifestyle adjustments aimed at weight loss and decreasing alcohol consumption and use of statin and nonstatin therapies.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112TW1vB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia pathophysiology — production, clearance, and lipoproteins: Plasma triglyceride level reflects the concentration of the triglyceride-carrying lipoproteins (VLDL and chylomicrons), and the concentration of VLDL cholesterol and apoB is at least 10 times higher than the corresponding chylomicron concentration, even after consumption of a large amount of fat. Hypertriglyceridemia results from increased triglyceride production, or reduced triglyceride catabolism, or both, and clearance of VLDL from the circulation is reduced in many patients with hypertriglyceridemia, in part due to saturation of triglyceride clearance. Defective lipolysis is linked to genetic defects in LpL or apoC-II, impaired association of LpL with the vascular wall, or defective intracellular LpL processing, and severe hyperchylomicronemia also occurs when a secondary cause such as diabetes or pregnancy is superimposed on an underlying genetic defect. Hypertriglyceridemic VLDL particles are heterogeneous and often have a high apoC-III/apoE ratio, causing reduced clearance and increased conversion to LDL. The common forms of hypertriglyceridemia emerge as adults get older and become overweight and sedentary and develop insulin resistance.

### Very severe hypertriglyceridemia complicating pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment: a call for management guidelines [^113qcABT]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia although rare within the pediatric population occur more often among oncology patients, secondary to chemotherapeutic agents. Currently there exists minimal literature to guide management of severe hypertriglyceridemia among pediatric patients. Very-low-fat dietary restriction should be considered over nil per os (NPO) for initial management of severe hypertriglyceridemia in stable pediatric patients. Pediatricians caring for oncology patients must consider chylomicronemia as a potential etiology for presenting symptoms. Pediatric severe hypertriglyceridemia management guidelines are needed as pediatricians must currently rely on anecdotal experiences for management decisions.

Case Presentation

Three children receiving treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia required hospitalization for very severe hypertriglyceridemia. Management varied among the cases but included: NPO or very-low-fat diet, insulin, intravenous fluids, fibrates, and omega-3 fatty acids.

Conclusions

These cases suggest that pediatric severe hypertriglyceridemia management, in the absence of pancreatitis should allow a very-low-fat diet initially rather than NPO followed by pharmacologic therapies.

### Management of hypertriglyceridemia [^115yBtXB]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is one of the most common lipid abnormalities encountered in clinical practice. Many monogenic disorders causing severe hypertriglyceridemia have been identified, but in most patients triglyceride elevations result from a combination of multiple genetic variations with small effects and environmental factors. Common secondary causes include obesity, uncontrolled diabetes, alcohol misuse, and various commonly used drugs. Correcting these factors and optimizing lifestyle choices, including dietary modification, is important before starting drug treatment. The goal of drug treatment is to reduce the risk of pancreatitis in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia and cardiovascular disease in those with moderate hypertriglyceridemia. This review discusses the various genetic and acquired causes of hypertriglyceridemia, as well as current management strategies. Evidence supporting the different drug and non-drug approaches to treating hypertriglyceridemia is examined, and an easy to adopt step-by-step management strategy is presented.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline on pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia [^116RRBuT]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence and provide updated and new recommendations for the pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia to prevent adverse cardiovascular outcomes. These recommendations are intended for use by clinicians, health care team members, patients, caregivers, and other stakeholders.

Methods

This guideline was developed by a multidisciplinary task force of content experts and guideline methodologists based on systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials or cohort studies from database inception to November 7, 2023. An updated literature search was completed for any additional articles published by May 31, 2024. Clinical questions addressing nonstatin medications and patient-important outcomes were prioritized. The task force assessed the certainty of the evidence and developed recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework. All recommendations were based on the consideration of the certainty of the evidence across patient-important outcomes, in addition to issues of feasibility, acceptability, equity, and patient preferences and values.

Results

This guideline update includes 13 evidence-based recommendations for the pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia focused on patient-important outcomes of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk reduction. The task force issued a good practice statement to assess the risk of ASCVD events for primary prevention in adults with dyslipidemia. The task force suggested the use of alirocumab, evolocumab, or bempedoic acid for adults who have ASCVD or who are at increased risk for ASCVD in addition to standard care. The task force suggested against the use of these medications in adults without ASCVD. There was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the addition of inclisiran. For adults with hypertriglyceridemia and ASCVD or increased risk of ASCVD, the task force suggested the use of eicosapentaenoic acid but not eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid and strongly recommended against the use of niacin. There was insufficient evidence for recommendations regarding pharmacologic management in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL). The task force suggested a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol treatment goal of < 70 mg/dL in adults with dyslipidemia and ASCVD or at increased risk of ASCVD.

Conclusions

Pharmacotherapy is recommended in adults with dyslipidemia to reduce the risk of ASCVD events. There are several effective and safe treatment options for adults with dyslipidemia who have ASCVD or at increased risk of ASCVD who need additional lipid-lowering medications. Shared decision-making discussions are essential to determine the best option for each individual.

Primary hypertriglyceridemia — risk assessment and lipid-pattern categories: We recommend that patients with primary hypertriglyceridemia be assessed for other cardiovascular risk factors, including central obesity, hypertension, abnormalities of glucose metabolism, and liver dysfunction; elevated triglycerides can occur with or without other lipid disturbances, and patients with elevations of both total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride can be divided into three categories: VLDL and/or LDL cholesterol elevated (as in familial combined hyperlipidemia), VLDL and chylomicron remnant cholesterol elevated (as in familial dysbetalipoproteinemia), and severe/very severe hypertriglyceridemia with increased VLDL and chylomicron cholesterol.

### The 2018 AHA / ACC / multi-society cholesterol guidelines: looking at past, present and future [^111tz2gY]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The authors review more than three decades of progress in providing clinicians and patients with guidance on risk assessment, patient evaluation and cholesterol management. Beginning with the National Cholesterol Education Program's Initial Adult Treatment Panel report, the cholesterol guidelines increasingly reflect the progress made in understanding the benefits of improved lifestyle and nutrition to improve lipid profiles, major risk factors and reduce ASCVD risk. Moreover, they now provide qualitative and quantitative assessment tools to guide appropriate risk reduction LDL-C lowering therapy. Use of the Pooled Cohort Equations to determine Low, Borderline, Intermediate and High 10-year ASCVD risk is now joined by recognition of conditions and biomarkers that enhance ASCVD risk. This personalizes the risk discussion for the patient. An important addition is the selective use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring to reclassify risk in patients at borderline or intermediate risk, but for whom a risk decision regarding statin therapy is uncertain. In secondary prevention, current guidelines provide criteria for determining a "very high" risk group in whom risk is especially high and in whom aggressive LDL-C lowering can be shown to provide increased absolute benefit. Current guidelines provide a comprehensive look at children and adolescents, young adults, elderly, women and issues specific to women through the life course. They provide guidance for those adults at risk due to severe hypercholesterolemia, persistent hypertriglyceridemia after secondary causes have been addressed, those with inflammatory disorders and HIV, those adults with chronic kidney disease, and those affected by issues of race/ethnicity. They conclude with a brief summary of recommendations emphasizing important concepts for providing safety with LDL-C lowering therapy. This combination of best external evidence and clinical expertise from the expert panel should provide a solid foundation for lipid management of patients at risk for or with clinical ASCVD.

d. Treatment of other lipoprotein fractions or targets.

Severe hypertriglyceridemia may warrant immediate therapy of this abnormality with lifestyle and usually pharmacologic therapy (fibric acid derivative or niacin) to reduce the risk of acute pancreatitis. In the absence of severe hypertriglyceridemia, therapy targeting HDL cholesterol or triglycerides has intuitive appeal but lacks the evidence base of statin therapy. If the HDL cholesterol is < 40 mg/dl and the LDL cholesterol is 100–129 mg/dl, gemfibrozil or niacin might be used, especially if a patient is intolerant to statins. Niacin is the most effective drug for raising HDL cholesterol. It can significantly increase blood glucose at high doses, but recent studies demonstrate that at modest doses (750–2,000 mg/day), significant improvements in LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels are accompanied by only modest changes in glucose that are generally amenable to adjustment of diabetes therapy.

Combination therapy with a statin and a fibrate or a statin and niacin may be efficacious for treatment of all three lipid fractions, but this combination is associated with an increased risk for abnormal transaminase levels, myositis, or rhabdomyolysis. The risk of rhabdomyolysis is higher with higher doses of statins and with renal insufficiency and seems to be lower when statins are combined with fenofibrate than gemfibrozil. Several ongoing trials may provide much-needed evidence for the effects of combination therapy on cardiovascular outcomes.

In 2008, a consensus panel convened by ADA and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) recommended a greater focus on non-HDL cholesterol and apo lipoprotein B (apo B) in patients who are likely to have small LDL particles, such as people with diabetes. The consensus panel suggested that for statin-treated patients in whom the LDL cholesterol goal would be < 70 mg/dl (non-HDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dl), apo B should be measured and treated to < 80 mg/dl. For patients on statins with an LDL cholesterol goal of < 100 mg/dl (non-HDL cholesterol < 130 mg/dl), apo B should be measured and treated to < 90 mg/dl.
