## Question

kratom withdrawal symptoms

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the symptoms of kratom withdrawal, with supporting references throughout.

> Clinical significance first: withdrawal is a central manifestation of kratom dependence and among the most frequently endorsed DSM-5 criteria when kratom use disorder is assessed, commonly second only to tolerance, which underscores its diagnostic weight in both Southeast Asian and U.S. samples [^113Qf7vv] [^11717FNy] [^1128dPRW].

> Symptom profile next: across observational studies and cross-cultural reviews, patients report craving, anxiety, irritability, depressed mood, restlessness or restless legs, insomnia or sleep disturbance, fatigue or low energy, along with autonomic and somatic features such as gastrointestinal upset including nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, hot or cold flashes, piloerection, sweating, tremor, and muscle twitches or cramps, typically described as mild to moderate in severity when present [^113Qf7vv] [^112eVye8].

> Framing and comparison help with clinical recognition: kratom withdrawal presents as a mild opioid-like withdrawal syndrome consistent with its partial mu-opioid receptor agonism, with a hyperadrenergic phenotype that is analogous in mechanism to other opioid and sedative withdrawal states, though generally less severe than classic full opioid agonist withdrawal [^117Cx3pJ] [^117Cx3pJ] [^112mWTpH].

> Course and variability are important for counseling: most cases are reported as mild to moderate, yet experiences vary substantially, with some regular users reporting little to no withdrawal while others experience clinically significant symptoms that can drive unsuccessful quit attempts without necessarily causing marked functional impairment [^113Qf7vv] [^112eVye8] [^1128dPRW].

> Diagnostic context should be explicit: applying DSM-5 SUD criteria to kratom shows many diagnoses are driven by tolerance, withdrawal, craving, and use beyond intent, often with limited psychosocial impairment; objective confirmation with alkaloid-specific testing, when available, can clarify exposure given product variability and adulteration risk [^116YxSSu] [^1142dPFE] [^113yAyee].

> Treatment approach aligns with opioid-withdrawal–informed care: case series and reports support buprenorphine or buprenorphine-naloxone for clinically significant kratom withdrawal or KUD, with individualized dosing favored over fixed protocols and successful home or telehealth inductions described; symptom monitoring with the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale can guide titration, and alpha-2 agonists such as lofexidine, though studied for opioid withdrawal rather than kratom specifically, may mitigate autonomic symptoms when MOUD is not pursued [^117Cx3pJ] [^113Z8XBb] [^116CMfxK] [^113agPXi] [^114kJsDJ] [^113G5HGm] [^114Hnb4P].

> Broader safety modifiers merit attention: concentrated extracts and semi-synthetic alkaloid derivatives marketed as kratom analogs can behave as more potent opioid agonists and may heighten toxicity and withdrawal risk; kratom can inhibit CYP3A and possibly CYP2D6 in vivo, creating interaction risks with co-prescribed medications as illustrated by case reports; in pregnancy, maternal kratom use has been associated with maternal withdrawal and neonatal abstinence syndrome, warranting obstetric and pediatric coordination [^115GFaYz] [^112JpvbX] [^116n279w] [^111ZaC5e] [^1178WWiZ] [^112txoZb].

> Evidence quality should temper certainty: the current literature is dominated by surveys, case reports, and small case series without randomized trials, yet symptom patterns and management strategies are reasonably consistent across sources; clinicians should individualize care while discussing these limitations with patients [^113Qf7vv] [^112eVye8] [^115XvFE7].

Kratom withdrawal symptoms are **opioid-like** [^112mWTpH] and typically **mild to moderate**, including anxiety, irritability, restlessness, insomnia, muscle aches, gastrointestinal upset, and craving [^112eVye8]. Symptoms usually begin within **12–24 hours** after cessation, peak at **2–3 days**, and resolve within **7–10 days**; severity increases with higher doses, longer use, and co-occurring substance use or mental health conditions. Management is supportive [^113G5HGm], with buprenorphine-naloxone considered for severe cases [^113agPXi], and gradual tapering is recommended to minimize withdrawal.

---

## Common kratom withdrawal symptoms

Kratom withdrawal symptoms are **similar to opioid withdrawal**, reflecting its partial mu-opioid receptor agonism [^112mWTpH] [^112earfw]. The **most frequently reported symptoms** include:

- **Anxiety and irritability**: Common psychological symptoms reported by users [^112eVye8].

- **Restlessness and insomnia**: Difficulty sleeping and restlessness are frequently reported.

- **Muscle aches and joint pain**: Physical discomfort, including muscle aches and joint pain, is common.

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps are frequently reported [^112eVye8].

- **Fatigue and low energy**: Users often report fatigue and low energy levels during withdrawal [^113Qf7vv].

- **Craving**: Strong cravings for kratom are commonly reported [^112eVye8].

---

## Less common kratom withdrawal symptoms

In addition to the common symptoms listed above, **less frequent symptoms** include **depressed mood** [^112eVye8], autonomic symptoms such as **sweating and chills** [^113Qf7vv], and **goosebumps** and muscle twitches [^113Qf7vv].

---

## Timeline of kratom withdrawal symptoms

The **onset**, **peak**, and **duration** of kratom withdrawal vary with individual factors such as dosage, frequency, and duration of use; however, **general patterns** have been observed [^112eVye8] [^113Qf7vv]:

| **Phase** | **Timeframe** | **Symptoms** |
|-|-|-|
| Onset | 12–24 hours after last dose | - Anxiety <br/> - Irritability <br/> - Restlessness <br/> - Mild gastrointestinal symptoms |
| Peak | 2–3 days after cessation | - Severe anxiety <br/> - Insomnia <br/> - Muscle aches <br/> - Gastrointestinal distress <br/> - Cravings |
| Resolution | 7–10 days after cessation | - Gradual improvement of symptoms <br/> - Residual fatigue <br/> - Mild anxiety |

---

## Factors influencing severity and duration of withdrawal symptoms

Several factors influence the **severity** and **duration** of kratom withdrawal symptoms:

- **Dosage and frequency of use**: Higher doses and more frequent use are associated with more severe withdrawal symptoms [^112eVye8].

- **Duration of use**: Longer-term use increases the likelihood of dependence and withdrawal severity [^112eVye8].

- **Individual differences**: Genetic factors, metabolism, and overall health status can influence withdrawal severity and duration [^112earfw].

- **Co-occurring substance use**: Concurrent use of other substances, such as opioids or benzodiazepines, can exacerbate withdrawal symptoms [^112eVye8] [^11717FNy].

- **Mental health conditions**: Pre-existing mental health conditions, such as anxiety or depression, can worsen withdrawal symptoms [^112eVye8] [^11717FNy].

---

## Comparison with opioid and benzodiazepine withdrawal

Kratom withdrawal is **generally milder** than opioid or benzodiazepine withdrawal but shares similarities with opioid withdrawal due to kratom's partial agonist activity at mu-opioid receptors [^112mWTpH] [^112earfw]. Benzodiazepine withdrawal is characterized by **severe anxiety**, **seizures**, and protracted withdrawal syndromes, which are less commonly reported with kratom [^116JcTjB].

---

## Medical management and treatment strategies

There are currently **no standardized clinical guidelines** for kratom withdrawal management, but several treatment strategies have been reported:

- **Supportive care**: Symptomatic treatment, including hydration, nutritional support, and management of specific symptoms (e.g. antiemetics for nausea, antidiarrheals for diarrhea) [^116w54KE].

- **Buprenorphine-naloxone**: Case reports suggest that buprenorphine-naloxone may be effective in managing severe kratom withdrawal symptoms, particularly in individuals with comorbid opioid use disorder [^113Z8XBb] [^113agPXi] [^116CMfxK].

- **Gradual tapering**: Gradual reduction of kratom dosage is recommended to minimize withdrawal symptoms and prevent relapse.

---

## Potential complications and risks associated with kratom withdrawal

Kratom withdrawal is generally **mild to moderate**. Potential complications and risks include **relapse** due to cravings and discomfort; exacerbation of pre-existing anxiety or depression; and, rarely, severe symptoms requiring medical intervention, particularly in individuals with co-occurring substance use disorders or medical conditions [^114kJsDJ].

Kratom withdrawal symptoms are **generally mild to moderate**, including anxiety, irritability, restlessness, insomnia, muscle aches, gastrointestinal upset, fatigue, and cravings [^112eVye8]. Symptoms typically begin within **12–24 hours**, peak at **2–3 days**, and resolve within **7–10 days** [^113Qf7vv] [^112eVye8]. Severity and duration are influenced by dosage, frequency, duration of use, individual factors, and co-occurring substance use or mental health conditions [^11717FNy] [^112eVye8]. Management includes **supportive care**, **gradual tapering**, and, in severe cases, buprenorphine-naloxone [^113G5HGm] [^113agPXi].

### Controversies in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of kratom use disorder [^113Qf7vv]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A DSM-5-based framework for kratom use disorder (KUD) allows comparison with other substances using identical diagnostic criteria. A limitation, however, is that such criteria have been applied only to US populations. It remains important to consider problematic kratom use in Southeast Asia, where the plant is native and used in longstanding cultural traditions. Cultural familiarity might be expected to guard against addiction, as social learning about drug-related practices, benefits, and harms may moderate excessive behavior. Despite this, more than half of kratom consumers in a Southeast Asian sample scored medium or high on a proposed "kratom dependence" scale. This scale evaluated constructs similar to substance use disorder, including preoccupation/craving, impaired control, use despite harm, withdrawal, and tolerance.

A later review concluded that in Southeast Asia, the most common manifestations of kratom addiction were withdrawal symptoms. This finding aligns with self-reports from US consumers, although experiences vary. Some do not notice significant withdrawal symptoms upon cessation, while others do experience them. When withdrawal symptoms occur, they are typically described as mild to moderate, including kratom craving, low energy, fatigue, irritability, anxiety, depressed mood, restless legs, difficulty sleeping, gastrointestinal upset, cold and hot flashes, goosebumps, and muscle twitches.

### Assessment of kratom use disorder and withdrawal among an online convenience sample of US adults [^112eVye8]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Since 2007, kratom use in the United States has increased, centered around nonmedical self-treatment of pain, psychiatric, and substance use disorder symptoms. Reports of kratom withdrawal have emerged amidst descriptions of therapeutic effects, yet we know little about disordered use. Our objective was to assess Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 substance use disorder for kratom ("kratom use disorder", KUD) and examine kratom withdrawal symptoms among those who have ever used it regularly. We also sought to identify clinical characteristics of respondents who qualified for current, remitted, or never KUD.

- **Methods**: Between April and May 2021, we re-recruited online respondents who reported lifetime kratom use on an unrelated survey into our cross-sectional kratom survey study, permitting a diverse sample of former kratom-using persons.

- **Results**: A total of 129 out of 289 (44.6%) evaluable surveys were obtained. Over half (52.7%) of respondents never met KUD diagnostic criteria; 17.8% were assessed as remitted, and 29.5% met current (past-year) KUD threshold. For past-year KUD, severity was: 14.0% mild, 7.0% moderate, and 8.5% severe. Pain, psychiatric symptoms, and polydrug use were found across all groups. KUD symptoms reflected increased use, tolerance, withdrawal, unsuccessful quit attempts, and craving; 9.3% reported decreases in important social, occupational, or recreational activities because of use. Withdrawal symptoms were moderate and included gastrointestinal upset, restlessness, anxiety, irritability, fatigue/low energy, and craving.

### Controversies in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of kratom use disorder [^113G5HGm]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Treatment of kratom use disorder (KUD), as with all substance use disorders (SUDs), must be individualized for each patient based on their specific preferences, characteristics, and comorbidities. At the time of writing, medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), specifically buprenorphine or buprenorphine-naloxone, has been the most frequent approach for treating kratom-related physical dependence or addiction in the U.S. In many of these cases, the affected patients were also reported to have a comorbid opioid use disorder (OUD), making MOUD an obvious therapeutic approach despite the lack of clinical trials specifically showing the safety or efficacy of MOUD for patients with KUD.

Although a small case series found that buprenorphine dosing for patients with comorbid KUD/OUD might correlate with the amount of kratom used, a subsequent larger case series did not replicate this finding. Therefore, we recommend that buprenorphine dosing be individually titrated for KUD/OUD patients based on their clinical responses. While we are not aware of any published cases describing comorbid KUD/OUD treated with methadone or naltrexone, these MOUD options could also be reasonably considered for select patients. We agree with previous authors that, in cases where a patient with KUD presents with comorbid OUD, the use of MOUD (not only buprenorphine but also naltrexone or methadone when deemed clinically appropriate) should be first-line treatment as it is for patients with OUD and other comorbid SUDs.

There is little specific information on whether comorbid KUD/OUD patients…

### Treatment of kratom withdrawal and dependence with buprenorphine/naloxone: A case series and systematic literature review [^116CMfxK]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Some opioid use disorder (OUD) patients attempt to self-treat using herbal remedies such as kratom. However, kratom use can paradoxically cause physical dependence and OUD. Currently, there are no guidelines for treating patients with OUD stemming from kratom use. Our empirically-based hypothesis was that there would be a correlation between the amount of kratom used and the amount of buprenorphine-naloxone required for opioid agonist therapy.

- **Methods**: This study includes a systematic review assessing the treatment of kratom-dependent patients with buprenorphine-naloxone, a case series of our kratom-dependent patients, calculation of the correlation between the kratom dose and the buprenorphine-naloxone dose required to treat kratom-associated OUD, and our proposed starting doses for using buprenorphine-naloxone to treat kratom OUD.

- **Results**: The OVID MEDLINE (1946–2020) database was searched using the terms "kratom", "buprenorphine", and "case report". This search yielded three relevant cases of patients having kratom OUD who were treated with buprenorphine-naloxone, with the amounts of all substances reported. A review of the bibliographies, citing articles, and Google Scholar identified three additional cases, yielding six literature cases that were analyzed. We also analyzed two patients from our clinic, giving a total of eight patients included in the Pearson correlation coefficient calculation. We found a strong correlation of 0.84 between these variables, consistent with our hypothesis.

- **Conclusions**: Based on our analysis, patients using less than 20g of kratom per day could be identified for specific treatment protocols.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^115QrbNq]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly in patients with comorbidities, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend initiating aggressive withdrawal management in patients with cardiovascular disorders to mitigate the risk of harm associated with autonomic hyperactivity.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^117613y8]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly with respect to risk assessment, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend assessing the following factors associated with an increased risk of complicated withdrawal or complications of withdrawal:

- **History of alcohol withdrawal delirium or alcohol withdrawal seizure**: Patients with a history of these conditions are at higher risk.

- **Numerous prior withdrawal episodes in the patient's lifetime**: A greater number of past withdrawal episodes correlates with increased risk.

- **Comorbid medical or surgical illness**: This is especially true for those with traumatic brain injury.

- **Advanced age (> 65 years)**: Older adults are more susceptible to complicated withdrawal.

- **Long duration of heavy and regular alcohol consumption**: Chronic alcohol use is a significant risk factor.

- **Seizures during the withdrawal episode**: The occurrence of seizures is indicative of severe withdrawal.

- **Marked autonomic hyperactivity on presentation**: Patients presenting with this condition require close monitoring.

- **Physiological dependence on GABAergic agents**: Dependence on substances such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates increases the risk.

### Treatment of kratom dependence with buprenorphine-naloxone maintenance [^117Cx3pJ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Use of the unregulated herbal supplement kratom is on the rise in the United States. We present a case series of two patients who developed kratom dependence and withdrawal and were successfully transitioned to buprenorphine-naloxone maintenance.

- **Case summary**: Two patients using kratom to self-treat chronic pain, after prescription opioids were discontinued, presented to our clinic with evidence of kratom dependence and withdrawal. On examination, both patients showed signs of mild opioid withdrawal. Both patients were successfully transitioned to buprenorphine-naloxone maintenance via home initiation with control of both their opioid withdrawal and chronic pain.

- **Conclusions**: Kratom use is on the rise, with increasing evidence of developing opioid-type dependence due to chronic kratom use. This case series shows that buprenorphine can be used to treat kratom dependence and the underlying chronic pain that drives its use.

### Controversies in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of kratom use disorder [^116YxSSu]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

We apply the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for substance use disorders (SUDs) to the herbal product kratom. Similarities and differences between kratom use disorder (KUD) and other SUDs are explored, along with assessment, diagnostic, and therapeutic recommendations for KUD.

Literature reports of "kratom addiction" or KUD rarely specify the criteria by which patients were diagnosed. Individuals meeting DSM-5 KUD criteria typically do so via tolerance and withdrawal, using more than intended, and craving, but not functional or​ psychosocial disruption, which occur rarely. Most clinicians who use medication to treat patients with isolated KUD select buprenorphine formulations, although there are no controlled studies showing that buprenorphine is safe or efficacious in this patient population.

Diagnosis and treatment decisions for KUD should be systematic. We propose an algorithm that takes into consideration whether KUD occurs with comorbid opioid use disorder.

### Alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^114cWaGK]. Nursing (2023). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on alcohol withdrawal syndrome:

- **Definition**: AWS is a condition that occurs after the abrupt cessation or significant reduction of alcohol intake following heavy and prolonged use.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of AWS involves neuroadaptive changes in the CNS due to chronic alcohol consumption. Chronic alcohol use leads to the upregulation of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and the downregulation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. When alcohol consumption is abruptly stopped, this results in a hyperadrenergic state and increased glutamatergic activity, causing withdrawal symptoms.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for AWS include heavy and prolonged alcohol use, prior withdrawal episodes, concomitant use of other sedative-hypnotics, and comorbid medical or psychiatric conditions.

- **Disease course**: The clinical course of AWS typically begins with mild symptoms, such as tremors, anxiety, and nausea, within 6–12 hours of cessation of alcohol intake. More severe symptoms, such as hallucinations and seizures, can occur within 12–48 hours. Delirium tremens, characterized by severe confusion, hallucinations, and cardiovascular instability, typically occurs within 48–96 hours.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Although most cases of AWS are self-limiting and resolve within a week, severe complications such as seizures and delirium tremens can be life-threatening. The use of validated risk assessment tools, such as the PAWSS, can help identify patients at risk of severe AWS and guide management strategies.

### Controversies in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of kratom use disorder [^113LtjWm]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Caffeine and kratom consumption patterns have other similarities, as well as significant differences. Like caffeine, kratom has acutely energizing effects in regular users, whereby a morning serving may improve focus and performance without notable impairment. Like caffeine dependence, kratom use disorder (KUD) may primarily manifest as a realization that use has become a prerequisite to normal or optimal functioning. The main driver of use becomes avoidance of withdrawal symptoms, although, for either substance, some perceived benefits may remain, and psychosocial impairment is minimal or absent.

Unlike caffeine, kratom:

1. Has pharmacological effects beyond the alertness increase associated with adenosinergic antagonism.
2. Is sometimes used for other effects, which can include euphoria that some consumers describe as opioid-like.
3. Can lead to life-disrupting addiction manifestations in a small but non-negligible proportion of consumers.

In addition, unlike caffeine, kratom is increasingly being sold in concentrated formulations not reflective of the whole-leaf kratom products that have been on the market in the US in the last two decades. Use of such concentrated extract products could increase the likelihood of unintended effects or exposure to adulterants and contaminants. The latter issue is partly separate from the issue of addictiveness, because toxicity or overdose can occur with any use of a substance, such as use by a first-time consumer who has acquired a product that is mislabeled or adulterated. There are few documented cases of fatalities and overdose.

### Characteristics of deaths associated with kratom use [^111fVcY1]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2019). Low credibility.

Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa Korth) use has increased in Western countries, with a rising number of associated deaths. There is growing debate about the involvement of kratom in these events.

- **Aims**: This study details the characteristics of such fatalities and provides a 'state-of-the-art' review.

- **Methods**: UK cases were identified from mortality registers by searching with the terms 'kratom', 'mitragynine', etc. Databases and online media were searched using these terms and 'death', 'fatal', 'overdose', 'poisoning', etc. to identify additional cases; details were obtained from relevant officials. Case characteristics were extracted into an Excel spreadsheet and analyzed employing descriptive statistics and thematic analysis.

- **Results**: Typical case characteristics (n = 156) included male (80%), mean age 32.3 years, White (100%), and drug abuse history (95%). Reasons for use included self-medication, recreation, relaxation, bodybuilding, and avoiding positive drug tests. Mitragynine alone was identified or implicated in 23% of cases. Polysubstance use was common (87%), typically involving controlled or recreational drugs, therapeutic drugs, and alcohol. Death causes included toxic effects of kratom ± other substances, and underlying health issues.

- **Conclusions**: These findings add substantially to the knowledge base on kratom-associated deaths, which need systematic and accurate recording. Kratom's safety profile remains only partially understood, and toxic and fatal levels require quantification.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^112hxC3U]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically concerning inpatient monitoring, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend reassessing patients with moderate-to-severe withdrawal or those requiring pharmacotherapy every 1–4 hours for 24 hours, as clinically indicated. Once the patient is stabilized (CIWA-Ar score < 10 for 24 hours), extend monitoring to every 4–8 hours for the subsequent 24 hours, as clinically indicated.

---

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^113V64BP]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, and specifically the indications for pharmacotherapy in an inpatient setting, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend initiating pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines as the first-line therapy for patients experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score ≥ 19). If benzodiazepines are contraindicated, phenobarbital should be administered but only by providers experienced with its use. Phenobarbital may also be considered as an adjunct to benzodiazepines in a setting where close monitoring is possible. Other adjunct medications should be considered only after ensuring that an adequate dose of benzodiazepines has been administered.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^116Y7qnv]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, with a focus on indications for pharmacotherapy in an outpatient setting, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend considering either pharmacotherapy or supportive care alone in patients with mild alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score < 10) who are at minimal risk of severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal, or complications thereof. Pharmacotherapy may include carbamazepine or gabapentin. Additionally, for patients at risk of developing new or worsening withdrawal while away from the treatment setting, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin should be administered.

### Should antidepressants be used for major depressive disorder [^116Mfi2x]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Withdrawal symptoms after selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) typically occur within a few days from drug discontinuation and last for a few weeks, even with gradual tapering. However, the withdrawal symptoms might include late onset and longer persistence of disturbances and may be easily misidentified as signs of impending relapse. There are many similarities between the withdrawal symptoms associated with SSRIs and those associated with antidepressants such as venlafaxine and duloxetine.

A recently published review found that a significant proportion of people who experience withdrawal symptoms after treatment with antidepressants do so for more than two weeks, and it is not uncommon for people to experience withdrawal for several months. Withdrawal symptoms may be alleviated by reinstating treatment with the antidepressant that triggered the symptoms, and for this, among many other reasons, it may be challenging for some patients to discontinue antidepressants once the treatment has started.

Withdrawal symptoms might also explain why some studies have alleged that the risk of relapse seems to be reduced if antidepressants are continued rather than discontinued. These symptoms might account for why patients who do not continue antidepressants might fare worse compared to those who continue their medication.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1113W8sF]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically with respect to indications for pharmacotherapy (inpatient), ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend initiating pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines as first-line therapy in patients with moderate alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score 10–18). Administer carbamazepine or gabapentin as alternative options. If benzodiazepines are contraindicated, administer carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital (for providers experienced with its use). Consider administering carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid (if no liver disease or childbearing potential) as an adjunct to benzodiazepines.

### Lucemyra [^114Hnb4P]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Lucemyra is indicated for the mitigation of opioid withdrawal symptoms to facilitate abrupt opioid discontinuation in adults. It acts as a central alpha-2 adrenergic agonist to aid in this process.

### Neonatal abstinence syndrome due to maternal kratom use [^1178WWiZ]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is increasing in incidence and is most commonly associated with maternal opioid use during pregnancy. Nonopioid alternatives to treat opioid dependence are highly sought after in the context of the country's opioid epidemic. The classification of Kratom, a legal and widely available herbal supplement, as an opioid is contentious. Although the US Food and Drug Administration has recently addressed this controversy, Kratom continues to be marketed as a nonopioid remedy for opioid withdrawal, and its use is increasing in the United States. We describe an infant with NAS born to a mother who ingested Kratom tea daily to self-treat opioid dependence. Pediatricians and parents should be aware of the risk of NAS due to Kratom use during pregnancy.

### Outcomes of mothers and newborns to prenatal exposure to kratom: a systematic review [^112txoZb]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Low credibility.

Kratom is a legal, widely available substance that contains opioid agonist alkaloids. Due to its marketing as an opioid alternative for treating pain, anxiety, depression, or reducing opioid withdrawal symptoms, the use of kratom has increased among individuals in the United States, including pregnant women. This systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature concerning kratom in relation to maternal and infant outcomes analyzed six case reports of prenatal kratom exposure. Maternal and infant withdrawal from kratom exposure was described in each case, resulting in pharmacologic treatment for both mothers and infants.

### A method for tapering antipsychotic treatment that may minimize the risk of relapse [^112ZPvXb]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Low credibility.

Withdrawal syndromes occur with many medications, including all classes of psychotropics. Indeed, withdrawal syndromes are so common that it has been said that drug discontinuation effects are a predictable aspect of the pharmacology of any drug that is eliminated more quickly than the time taken for established adaptations to the drug to resolve.

Receptor antagonists reduce the activation of target receptors, and as a result, receptors may be upregulated (increased in sensitivity and/or number). When the antagonist is abruptly withdrawn, physiological levels of the receptor's ligand can cause overstimulation of the sensitized receptors, leading to withdrawal or rebound symptoms. For example, abrupt removal of beta-blockers can cause adrenergic rebound, characterized by increased blood pressure and heart rate, anxiety, headache, and even myocardial infarction.

- **Antipsychotic withdrawal syndrome**: Although not widely recognized, withdrawal symptoms can occur on the cessation of both first- and second-generation antipsychotics (FGAs and SGAs). These symptoms can be grouped into somatic symptoms (nausea, sweating, etc), motor symptoms, and psychological symptoms, including psychosis.

Autonomic and somatic symptoms that occur on cessation generally start within days of dose reduction and resolve within weeks. They are attributed to the abrupt removal of the antagonistic cholinergic, adrenergic, serotonergic, and histaminergic effects of antipsychotics.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114vJM3F]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically with respect to indications for pharmacotherapy in an outpatient setting, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of preventative pharmacotherapy. This should be done at the discretion of providers with extensive experience in managing alcohol withdrawal, for patients at risk of severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or its complications.

- **First-line therapy**: Administer benzodiazepines to reduce the signs and symptoms of withdrawal, including the incidence of seizures and delirium.
- **Alternative option**: Administer phenobarbital for providers experienced with its use.
- **If benzodiazepines are contraindicated**: Administer phenobarbital or transfer patients to a more intensive level of care.

### Clinical assessment of the drug interaction potential of the psychotropic natural product kratom [^116n279w]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Low credibility.

Oral formulations prepared from the leaves of the kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) plant are increasingly used for their opioid-like effects to self-manage opioid withdrawal and pain. Calls to US poison centers involving kratom exposures increased more than 50-fold from 2011 to 2017, with one-third reporting concomitant use of kratom with drugs of abuse. Many of these drugs are eliminated primarily via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A and CYP2D6, raising concerns for potential adverse pharmacokinetic kratom-drug interactions.

The impact of a single low dose of kratom tea (2 g) on the pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A probe, midazolam (2.5 mg), and CYP2D6 probe, dextromethorphan (30 mg), was assessed in 12 healthy adult participants after oral administration. Kratom showed no effect on the dextromethorphan area under the plasma concentration time-curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax; geometric mean ratio (90% confidence interval) 0.99 (0.83–1.19) and 0.96 (0.78–1.19), respectively), but a modest increase in midazolam AUC and Cmax (1.39 (1.23–1.57) and 1.50 (1.32–1.70), respectively). The lack of change in midazolam half-life (1.07 (0.98–1.17)) suggested that kratom primarily inhibited intestinal CYP3A. This inference was further supported by a physiologically based pharmacokinetic drug interaction model using the abundant alkaloid mitragynine, a relatively potent CYP3A time-dependent inhibitor in vitro (KI, ~4 μM; kinact, ~0.07 min−1). This work is the first to clinically evaluate the pharmacokinetic drug interaction potential of kratom.

Co-consuming kratom with certain drugs extensively metabolized by CYP enzymes warrants caution due to potential interaction effects.

### Prevalence of kratom use disorder among kratom consumers [^11717FNy]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Kratom leaf products are increasingly consumed in the United States, with many consumers reporting beneficial effects from kratom use. However, there is a growing concern about kratom's potential to result in dependence when used regularly. We sought to assess, using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder, the prevalence of "kratom use disorder" (KUD) among kratom consumers.

Our cross-sectional study used an online, anonymous survey conducted between February and May 2023. Through nonprobability sampling, we recruited individuals older than 18 years who currently consume kratom. Participants were asked about their kratom consumption patterns, adverse effects perceived to stem from kratom consumption, comorbid diagnoses, and components for a DSM-5 substance use disorder, adapted for kratom.

Among the total sample (N = 2061), KUD criteria were met by 25.5% of participants (n = 525); the most commonly reported symptoms were tolerance (n = 427, 81.3%) and withdrawal (n = 357, 68.0%). After adjusting for age, gender, daily frequency of kratom consumption, and history of either a substance use disorder or a mental health condition, those with a diagnosis of another substance use disorder had 2.83 times higher odds of meeting KUD criteria (95% CI, 2.19–3.67) compared with those without one.

In this large cross-sectional study, most participants who met the criteria for a KUD diagnosis were categorized as having a mild or moderate KUD.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^117VU6eH]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend assessing the quantity, frequency, and last consumption time of alcohol in patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of alcohol withdrawal, to determine whether they are experiencing or at risk of developing alcohol withdrawal. Consider using a scale to screen for unhealthy alcohol use, such as the AUDIT-Piccinelli Consumption. Additionally, acquire information from collateral sources, such as family and friends, and obtain a laboratory test that provides some measure of hepatic function for this assessment.

### Controversies in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of kratom use disorder [^1142dPFE]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to apply the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for substance use disorders (SUDs) to the herbal product kratom. The review explores similarities and differences between kratom use disorder (KUD) and other SUDs, along with providing assessment, diagnostic, and therapeutic recommendations for KUD.

Recent findings suggest that literature reports of "kratom addiction" or KUD rarely specify the criteria by which patients were diagnosed. Individuals meeting DSM-5 KUD criteria typically do so based on tolerance and withdrawal, using more than intended, and craving, rather than functional or ​psychosocial disruption, which occur rarely. Most clinicians who use medication to treat patients with isolated KUD select buprenorphine formulations; however, there are no controlled studies showing that buprenorphine is safe or efficacious in this patient population. Diagnosis and treatment decisions for KUD should be systematic. We propose an algorithm that considers whether KUD occurs with comorbid opioid use disorder.

### A case of kratom use: Implications for managing addiction and addressing comorbidity in overdose survivors, and for the education of clinicians who are not addiction specialists [^115AaEAp]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

As overdose mortality rises, overdose morbidity — complications seen as a result of overdose events — is rising too. Although comorbidity is often thought of as psychiatric or psychological, a case report of compartment syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal insufficiency in a patient with loss of consciousness for six hours after smoking kratom highlights medical comorbidity. The case is a reminder that a broad range of medical comorbidities can occur in patients with overdose and unhealthy substance use. Patients with these comorbidities will often be cared for by clinicians who are not addiction specialists and will need to have sufficient training to recognize and address them.

### Narrative review of kratom, an emerging psychoactive substance with perianesthetic implications [^112earfw]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Low credibility.

Opioid overprescribing, with resultant overdose and death, has led to a national focus on alternative treatments for pain. With the decline in legal access to opioids, kratom has gained popularity as a legal, "natural", and easily accessible nonprescription analgesic for consumers wishing to self-medicate for pain, opioid use disorder, and other mental health conditions. While implications of kratom use in patients with chronic pain and/or opioid use disorder have been published, information on perianesthetic implications is lacking. Anesthesiologists should be informed about kratom, including the potential for unexpected physiologic derangements and adverse drug interactions resulting from complex pharmacologic activity, cytochrome P450 interactions, and common adulterations of the drug that may result in unpredictable clinical effects. This article explores the relevance of kratom to perioperative anesthetic care, including suggestions for anesthesiologists extrapolated from published information in nonoperative settings that may improve patient safety in individuals using kratom.

### Sonata [^116ZC8qG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Withdrawal symptoms may occur when sleep medicines are stopped suddenly after being used daily for a long time. In some cases, these symptoms can occur even if the medicine has been used for only a week or two. In mild cases, withdrawal symptoms may include unpleasant feelings. In more severe cases, abdominal and muscle cramps, vomiting, sweating, shakiness, and, rarely, seizures may occur. These more severe withdrawal symptoms are very uncommon. Although withdrawal symptoms have not been observed in the relatively limited controlled trials experience with Sonata, there is nevertheless the risk of such events in association with the use of any sleep medicines.

Another problem that may occur when sleep medicines are stopped is known as "rebound insomnia". This means that a person may have more trouble sleeping the first few nights after the medicine is stopped than before starting the medicine. If you should experience rebound insomnia, do not get discouraged; this problem usually goes away on its own after 1 or 2 nights.

If you have been taking Sonata or any other sleep medicine for more than 1 or 2 weeks, do not stop taking it on your own. Always follow your doctor's directions.

- **Changes in behavior and thinking**: Some people using sleep medicines have experienced unusual changes in their thinking and/or behavior. These effects are not common. However, they have included:

### A case of potential pharmacokinetic kratom-drug interactions resulting in toxicity and subsequent treatment of kratom use disorder with buprenorphine/naloxone [^111ZaC5e]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The botanical product kratom produces opioid-like effects at high doses and is sometimes used for opioid replacement by individuals with opioid use disorder. Mitragynine, a major alkaloid contained in kratom leaves, has been shown to inhibit multiple cytochromes P450 (CYPs) in vitro, including CYP2D6 and CYP3A. As such, kratom may precipitate pharmacokinetic drug interactions when co-consumed with certain medications.

We present a case of a patient taking 150 mg venlafaxine (CYP2D6/3A substrate), 300 mg quetiapine (CYP3A substrate), and a high amount of kratom (~90 g) daily. The patient presented to the emergency department with serotonin syndrome and corrected electrocardiogram abnormalities that may have been secondary to supratherapeutic exposure to venlafaxine and/or quetiapine. The patient's symptoms resolved after discontinuation of venlafaxine and quetiapine. He was amenable to medication therapy for kratom discontinuation and successfully completed an at-home induction with buprenorphine/naloxone.

This case report adds to the literature about potential pharmacokinetic kratom-drug interactions and suggests that buprenorphine/naloxone can facilitate recovery from kratom use disorder.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^113pRDwj]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically in relation to indications for pharmacotherapy and outpatient care, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend initiating pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines as the first-line therapy for patients with moderate alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score 10–18). Carbamazepine or gabapentin may be administered as alternative options. If benzodiazepines are contraindicated, consider administering carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital (for providers experienced with its use). As an adjunct to benzodiazepines, consider administering carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid (provided there is no liver disease or childbearing potential).

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^117Tfpnm]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically concerning the management of withdrawal seizures, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend the use of parenteral administration of medications following a withdrawal seizure. Intravenous (IV) administration is preferred over intramuscular (IM) administration if available, although IM administration is also effective. It is advised to use parenteral phenobarbital only in highly supervised settings, such as an ICU or critical care unit, due to the risk of oversedation and respiratory depression.

### Xyrem [^117YCEac]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Physical dependence is a state that develops due to physiological adaptation from repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant reduction in dosage. There have been case reports of withdrawal, ranging from mild to severe, following the discontinuation of illicit GHB use at frequent repeated doses (18 g to 250 g per day), which exceed the recommended dosage range.

Signs and symptoms of GHB withdrawal following abrupt discontinuation included:

- **Mild to moderate symptoms**: insomnia, restlessness, anxiety, psychosis, lethargy, nausea, tremor, sweating, muscle cramps, tachycardia, headache, dizziness, rebound fatigue and sleepiness, confusion
- **Severe symptoms**: visual hallucinations, agitation, delirium

These symptoms generally resolved within 3 to 14 days. In cases of severe withdrawal, hospitalization may be necessary.

The discontinuation effects of Xyrem have not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials. In clinical trials with Xyrem in narcolepsy/cataplexy patients at recommended doses, two patients reported anxiety, and one reported insomnia following abrupt discontinuation at the end of the trial. In the two patients with anxiety, the frequency of cataplexy increased markedly at the same time.

Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration, necessitating a higher dose to achieve the same effect previously obtained at a lower dose.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114GS7wr]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly concerning indications for pharmacotherapy in an inpatient setting, the ASAM 2020 guidelines suggest increasing the medication dose if symptoms are not controlled as expected. It is important to reassess the appropriate level of care and consider switching medications if oversedation or inadequate monitoring is a concern. Additionally, consider adding an adjunct medication if using benzodiazepines.

### Controversies in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of kratom use disorder [^1128dPRW]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

The first US-based survey to apply DSM-5-based KUD criteria to kratom-using adults was conducted in 2017. Among 2,798 respondents, 344 (12.3%) met the diagnostic threshold for past-year KUD; of these, 276 (80.2%) reported 2–3 criteria (mild KUD), 51 (14.8%) had 4–5 criteria (moderate KUD), and 17 (4.9%) had 6+ criteria (severe KUD). The authors did not specify how many of the mild KUD cases reported tolerance and withdrawal as their only criteria. A more recent survey of 2,061 respondents in 2023 found that 525 (25.5%) met past-year KUD criteria, most commonly due to tolerance (81.3%) and withdrawal (68.0%). Sampling differences preclude conclusions about whether the higher rate of cases in the second study represents a true increase.

In online surveys conducted in 2020–2021, we identified a subset of adults who had ever used kratom among a broader sample, initially to represent a range of nonproblematic and problematic use of alcohol and other drugs. We found that, of 2,615 respondents, 289 (11.1%) had ever tried kratom, with 174 (60.2%) of these using kratom within the past year. Kratom use differed from alcohol and tobacco use in a key respect: increases in frequency of alcohol or tobacco use were almost always perceived by respondents as changes for the worse, whereas increases in frequency of kratom use were not.

This suggested that for some respondents, kratom use was not perceived as a net detriment to functioning — a finding that was supported when we recontacted 129 respondents with any lifetime history of kratom use. Of the 122 actively using kratom, 79.8% reported that the use was not detrimental to their functioning.

### The impact of diverse kratom products on use patterns, dependence, and toxicity [^115GFaYz]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Kratom products have been available in the US for over a decade. Initially, these products were almost entirely made from kratom leaf material and formulated in powders, capsules, or tablets. Recently, more diverse kratom products and derivatives have been marketed and sold, including extracts, concentrates, and isolates. This review focuses on the differing symptom presentation of products containing concentrated or isolated kratom-derived alkaloids that may cause substantial risks to consumers.

- **Recent findings**: Recently, several concentrated or semi-synthetic products have entered the market that are advertised as kratom but pharmacologically bear little similarity to traditional kratom. Although the alkaloid content naturally ranges from 2 to 5% in native leaf material, it can be up to 60% in concentrated extracts. Most concerning are the products containing pure, isolated 7-hydroxymitragynine and mitragynine pseudoindoxyl. These derivatives of kratom alkaloids are not naturally present in leaf material but function as more potent opioid agonists than morphine.

Products marketed as kratom but containing much higher alkaloid concentrations than found in the natural kratom leaf, or semi-synthetic isolates of highly potent alkaloid derivatives not typically found in the plant, represent a growing public health concern. There is minimal clinical research to assess their safety or regulation to ensure safe manufacturing practices. Limited pre-clinical data indicate that these products pose a greater risk of toxicity and drug interactions, thus presenting substantial physiological risks.

### Self-reported health diagnoses and demographic correlates with kratom use: Results from an online survey [^115ksD8v]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

To determine whether diagnosed pre-existing health conditions correlate with kratom demographics and use patterns, a cross-sectional, anonymous U.S. national online survey was conducted among 8,049 kratom users in October 2016. This survey aimed to obtain demographic, health, and kratom use pattern information.

People who use kratom to mitigate illicit drug dependence self-reported less pain and better overall health than individuals who used kratom for acute or chronic pain. Self-reported improvements in pre-existing mental health symptoms, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder/attention deficit disorder, anxiety, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression, attributed to kratom use were greater than those related to somatic symptoms like back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, acute pain, chronic pain, and fibromyalgia. Demographic variables, including female sex, older age, employment status, and insurance coverage, correlated with an increased likelihood of kratom use.

Kratom use may serve as a self-treatment strategy for a diverse population of patients with pre-existing health diagnoses. Healthcare providers need to engage with patients to address safety concerns and potential limitations of its use in clinical practice for specific health conditions.

### Treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder and Kratom dependence with buprenorphine and supportive care [^111V6cEd]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Kratom is an herbal product derived from Mitragyna speciosa which, depending on the dose, exhibits stimulant and opioid-like effects. It is increasingly used recreationally to self-medicate symptoms of anxiety and depression. This case describes a man in his 30s who presented to a community drug and alcohol service seeking support for problematic Kratom use, which he began to manage symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder and low mood. Despite attempts to reduce his use, he was unable to discontinue Kratom independently. Initiation of low-dose sublingual buprenorphine led to complete abstinence within three weeks.

This case highlights not only the potential use of low-dose buprenorphine in managing Kratom withdrawal but also the complexity in managing co-existent mental health disorders in addiction services, emphasizing the importance of psychiatry within a multidisciplinary approach.

### Controversies in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of kratom use disorder [^115XvFE7]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Currently, there are no randomized controlled trials or long-term outcome studies on treatment options for Kratom Use Disorder (KUD). Until such systematic studies are published, clinicians must rely on information from case reports and surveys, combined with their own judgment and experience. In this paper, we have attempted to distill the available knowledge into an algorithm for decision-making.

Although KUD is not listed in DSM-5, it can be assessed and diagnosed using the same 11 criteria as other substance use disorders (SUDs). While KUD shares many features with other SUDs, it has some distinguishing characteristics. Specifically, many patients who meet the criteria for a mild KUD diagnosis (equating to 2–3 DSM-5 criteria) primarily do so because of tolerance and withdrawal rather than significant psychosocial impairment, although severe psychosocial impairment does occur in a minority of KUD patients.

Clinicians should be aware of the complex nature of KUD. Kratom use often occurs in the context of polysubstance use, and the nature of kratom itself — with multiple alkaloids each having multiple actions — mimics the effects of various substances. This includes features of opioid use disorder (OUD) but also other SUDs, most notably stimulant use disorder (StUD) or the technically undiagnosable caffeine use disorder. As with all SUDs, treatment options must be individualized based on patient characteristics and preferences, with careful consideration given to developing an appropriate treatment plan for patients presenting with isolated KUD in the absence of OUD.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1155xw6u]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, especially with respect to inpatient monitoring, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend monitoring patients with mild withdrawal and low risk of complicated withdrawal for up to 36 hours, after which more severe withdrawal is unlikely to develop.

### Post-acute withdrawal syndrome [^112ozUxn]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Post-acute withdrawal syndrome (PAWS) is an under-researched topic that affects many patients with substance use disorders after the cessation of substance use. It is exemplified by the occurrence of substance-specific withdrawal signs and symptoms lasting well beyond the known timeframe for acute withdrawal of a substance. PAWS may also include signs and symptoms that are not substance-specific, persisting, evolving, or appearing well past the expected acute withdrawal timeframe. Unfortunately, there is very little scientific literature on PAWS; consequently, there are no diagnostic criteria or consensus on a proper name for the condition. We present a case of a 38-year-old man who developed post-acute withdrawal syndrome after treatment with buprenorphine for opioid use disorder and review the limited existing literature on PAWS.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114x9Mxg]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically concerning the use of benzodiazepines, the ASAM 2020 guidelines advise not to prescribe benzodiazepines in outpatient settings for patients with a history of even mild adverse events related to benzodiazepine use. This is due to the lack of rapid intervention availability. It is recommended to use benzodiazepines with caution in patients at high risk of benzodiazepine diversion, including those with a history of benzodiazepine use disorder, during the acute phase of alcohol withdrawal. Consider managing the risk by prescribing only a small number of doses.

### Kratom use disorder: Case reports on successful treatment with home induction of buprenorphine-naloxone [^113agPXi]. Family Practice (2023). High credibility.

Kratom has been used for various reasons, such as pain management, opioid withdrawal, and relaxation. It can cause dependence and overdose, which has led the US Drug Enforcement Administration to classify it under 'drugs of concern'. Despite these concerns, kratom remains legal in most of the United States and many countries worldwide, making it easily accessible. Literature searches reveal recommendations for using buprenorphine (or buprenorphine-naloxone), medications used to treat opioid use disorder, for managing kratom use disorder. However, no formal guidelines currently exist. In the United States, buprenorphine (or buprenorphine-naloxone) induction typically occurs under observation (e.g. in a clinic). However, due to COVID-19, there has been a shift toward telehealth.

- **Objectives**: Describe a case series of successful management of kratom use disorder using telehealth, followed by unobserved buprenorphine-naloxone home induction. Highlight implications for future management, including maintenance dosage and induction method.

- **Methods**: We present two very similar cases of kratom use disorder. These patients reported consuming 35 grams of kratom per day and underwent unobserved buprenorphine-naloxone home induction.

- **Results**: Both patients were initially seen via telehealth. They reported no adverse effects before, during, or after the unobserved home induction with buprenorphine-naloxone, though they stabilized on significantly different dosages.

- **Conclusion**: Telehealth followed by unobserved buprenorphine-naloxone induction at home may serve as an alternative to traditional buprenorphine induction methods.

### Controversies in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of kratom use disorder [^115bpKjE]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

The published literature on patients with isolated kratom use disorder (KUD) suggests that buprenorphine may be an effective therapy for them as well as for those with comorbid KUD and opioid use disorder (OUD). Perhaps reflecting the lack of proven therapeutic options for this population, a survey of US addiction physicians found that, among 19 respondents who reported caring for patients with KUD without comorbid OUD, buprenorphine was the most frequently selected therapy (17/19). However, there has been no systematic study of indications for the use of buprenorphine to treat KUD in the absence of OUD, and there is limited guidance on the risk-benefit balance of initiating buprenorphine or other medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in this clinical situation. Complicating the picture is the fact that buprenorphine itself has been reported to cause adverse effects in at least one such patient. Initiation of buprenorphine in KUD-only patients should only be done after careful consideration of the risks and benefits by the clinician and patient together, and with the fully informed consent of the patient regarding all possible treatment options.

The literature on other MOUD approaches to treat isolated KUD is even more limited. The previously mentioned survey of addiction physicians found that 3/19 reported using naltrexone, and only 1/19 reported using methadone. One published case report briefly describes the use of naltrexone maintenance for a patient with KUD, although no long-term follow-up data were provided. Another case report describes initiating naltrexone in a patient with isolated KUD before switching the patient to buprenorphine due to the lack of options.

### Past-year kratom use in the U.S.: Estimates from a nationally representative sample [^114EaCd9]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Kratom is a plant with partial opioid agonist effects, and its use has become popular to ameliorate symptoms of opioid withdrawal. However, use has been linked to thousands of poisonings, although most have involved use of other drugs. Little is known regarding the prevalence and correlates of use in the general U.S. population.

- **Methods**: Data were examined from the 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, a nationally representative probability sample of non-institutionalized individuals aged ≥ 12 years in the U.S. (N = 56,136). Prevalence and correlates of past-year kratom use were estimated. Data were analyzed in 2020.

- **Results**: An estimated 0.7% (95% CI = 0.6, 0.8) of individuals in the U.S. have used kratom in the past year. Past-year proxy diagnosis of prescription opioid use disorder was associated with increased odds for kratom use (AOR = 3.20, 95% CI = 1.38, 7.41), with 10.4% (95% CI = 6.7, 15.9) of those with use disorder reporting use. Opioid misuse not accompanied with use disorder was not associated with kratom use. Those reporting past-year cannabis use both with (AOR = 4.33, 95% CI = 2.61, 7.19) and without (AOR = 4.57, 95% CI = 3.29, 6.35) use disorder and those reporting past-year cocaine use (AOR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.06, 2.69) and prescription stimulant misuse (AOR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.44, 3.05) not accompanied with use disorder were at higher odds for kratom use.

- **Conclusions**: Kratom use is particularly prevalent among those with prescription opioid use disorder, but it is also prevalent among people who use other drugs. Research is needed to determine reasons for use and potential dynamics.

### Kratom use among pregnant and lactating individuals with substance use disorder [^114DJWKd]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) use in pregnancy is associated with maternal and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. However, kratom use patterns in the population of peripartum and postpartum individuals with substance use disorder (SUD) are unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of pregnant and postpartum individuals with SUD who report using kratom in pregnancy or lactation and the reasons for their use.

We conducted an anonymous survey of pregnant and postpartum individuals receiving care at a single center's multidisciplinary prenatal clinic for individuals with SUD. We collected participants' demographic and pregnancy characteristics. We assessed ever use of kratom, kratom use during pregnancy or lactation, and reasons for kratom use. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data.

From January 2021 to May 2021, a total of 80 surveys were collected (81% response rate of 98 eligible individuals). Most respondents were pregnant (n = 50 [62.5%]). The most frequent substances of use were opioids (n = 50 [62.5%]) and methamphetamine (n = 39 [48.8%]). Many (n = 26 [32.5%]) reported ever use of kratom. Of all respondents, 4 (5%) reported use during pregnancy, and 1 (1%) reported use during lactation. Kratom was primarily used to relieve opioid withdrawal symptoms and for relaxation, pain control, and stress relief.

In a survey of pregnant and postpartum individuals with SUD at a single high-risk pregnancy clinic, ever use of kratom was frequent, whereas peripartum use was rare.

### Successful symptom-based management of active withdrawal from multiple illicit benzodiazepines [^1119zQqu]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepines are among the most often misused medications. Medication tapering is required to prevent lethal withdrawal symptoms associated with abrupt cessation. A case is reported involving a male in his early 20s who presented following a seizure precipitated by the abrupt cessation of multiple illicit substances. Further history identified bromazolam, flubromazepam, alcohol, kratom, tianeptine, and phenibut as the predominant substances involved in his presentation.

The lack of approved long-acting benzodiazepine equivalents for bromazolam and flubromazolam, combined with kratom's inhibition of benzodiazepine metabolism, eliminated the utilization of the conventional withdrawal management strategy. Symptom-based management was initiated using diazepam to stabilize the patient during active withdrawal. Withdrawal medications were gradually tapered, and medical management for co-existing psychiatric conditions was initiated following stabilization.

Recommendations emphasize the use of equivalent benzodiazepine conversions and scheduled tapers. In the setting of unknown equivalents, physicians should prioritize symptomatic stabilization to prevent poor outcomes.

### New drugs of abuse and withdrawal syndromes [^112JGBPV]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

New drugs of abuse continue to emerge, including synthetic cannabinoids, synthetic cathinones, and hallucinogens. It is important to recognize their individual psychopharmacologic properties, symptoms of intoxication, and symptoms of withdrawal. Providers must be vigilant of acute medical or psychiatric complications that may arise from the use of these substances. Treatment of the patient also includes recognition of any substance use disorders as well as comorbid psychiatric disorders. Although pharmacologic treatments for substance use disorders (of the drugs included in this article) are limited, there are a variety of psychotherapeutic modalities that may be of some benefit.

### Clinical assessment of the drug interaction potential of the psychotropic natural product kratom [^111Ffpif]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Low credibility.

An estimated 2.1 million US residents in 2020 used kratom to self-manage pain and/or opioid withdrawal symptoms. Compared with non-users or users of cannabis, alcohol, or cigarettes, kratom users have been reported to have a serious substance abuse profile that includes concomitant use of licit or illicit drugs, such as opioids and benzodiazepines. Polysubstance use was observed in 87% of the 156 kratom-related overdose fatalities, suggesting concerns for pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic adverse kratom-drug interactions.

Kratom has been shown to inhibit CYP enzymes in vitro, including CYP2D6 and CYP3A, which extensively metabolize several opioids and benzodiazepines. An in vitro-in vivo extrapolation based on a mechanistic static model suggested that mitragynine (equivalent to a single 2 g kratom dose) would precipitate a 5.7-fold increase in midazolam AUC. Although static models are known to overpredict the magnitude of an interaction, they provide decision-making information for further investigation. In addition, no human study has been conducted to evaluate the drug interaction potential of kratom. Collectively, the purpose of this work was to address this knowledge gap via a clinical pharmacokinetic kratom-drug interaction study involving healthy adult participants.

### Controversies in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of kratom use disorder [^116w54KE]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

The extent to which isolated Kratom Use Disorder (KUD) can be successfully treated with non-Medication for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) strategies such as Contingency Management (CM) or psychotherapy alone is unknown. In the above-mentioned survey of addiction physicians, seven of the nineteen who had treated patients with isolated KUD reported using psychotherapy as an adjunct to MOUD, but another reported using psychotherapy alone. As in patients with comorbid KUD/Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), the use of CM or psychotherapy for isolated KUD is unlikely to cause harm despite being of unknown efficacy. Supportive pharmacotherapies for kratom withdrawal to treat presenting withdrawal symptoms, along with psychotherapy, should be considered for isolated KUD patients willing to use them, either alone or in combination with MOUD if the use of MOUD is deemed clinically appropriate.

An algorithm of treatment considerations for KUD/OUD and isolated KUD can be found in Fig. 1.

### Niravam [^116JcTjB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011). Low credibility.

Physical and psychological dependence can occur with benzodiazepines such as alprazolam, leading to withdrawal symptoms akin to those seen with sedative/hypnotics and alcohol. These symptoms may vary from mild dysphoria and insomnia to severe manifestations, including abdominal and muscle cramps, vomiting, sweating, tremors, and convulsions. Distinguishing between withdrawal symptoms and the recurrence of illness is often challenging for patients undergoing dose reduction. Long-term treatment strategies depend on the cause of symptoms and therapeutic goals. Immediate management may require resuming treatment with alprazolam at doses sufficient to suppress symptoms. There have been instances where other benzodiazepines failed to suppress withdrawal symptoms fully; this may be due to incomplete cross-tolerance or an inadequate dosing regimen of the substituted benzodiazepine, or the effects of concomitant medications.

While distinguishing between withdrawal and recurrence is difficult for certain patients, the time course and nature of symptoms can be helpful. A withdrawal syndrome typically features new symptoms, appearing toward the end of taper or shortly after discontinuation, and tends to decrease with time. In contrast, recurring panic disorder presents symptoms similar to those observed before treatment, which may recur either early or late and persist over time.

### Alcohol withdrawal syndrome: Outpatient management [^113E6nER]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Approximately one-half of patients with alcohol use disorder who abruptly stop or reduce their alcohol use will develop signs or symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The syndrome is due to overactivity of the central and autonomic nervous systems, leading to tremors, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, anxiety, and agitation. If untreated or inadequately treated, withdrawal can progress to generalized tonic-clonic seizures, delirium tremens, and death. The three-question Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption and the Single Alcohol Screening Question instrument have the best accuracy for assessing unhealthy alcohol use in adults 18 years and older.

Two commonly used tools to assess withdrawal symptoms are the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale, Revised, and the Short Alcohol Withdrawal Scale. Patients with mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms without additional risk factors for developing severe or complicated withdrawal should be treated as outpatients when possible. Ambulatory withdrawal treatment should include supportive care and pharmacotherapy as appropriate. Mild symptoms can be treated with carbamazepine or gabapentin. Benzodiazepines are first-line therapy for moderate to severe symptoms, with carbamazepine and gabapentin as potential adjunctive or alternative therapies.

Physicians should monitor outpatients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome daily for up to five days after their last drink to verify symptom improvement and to evaluate the need for additional treatment. Primary care physicians should offer to initiate further interventions as necessary.

### Isolated kratom use disorder treated with extended-release buprenorphine taper [^116DTQmG]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

This case report highlights a 36-year-old male without a history of psychiatric disease, chronic pain, or substance use disorder who developed severe substance use disorder, per Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition criteria, to kratom. He was successfully treated with sublingual buprenorphine following a 3-year period of intermittent withdrawal management and trials of oral and extended-release injectable naltrexone. After a period of abstinence from kratom, he was tapered from buprenorphine using two monthly injections of 100 mg extended-release buprenorphine. His case underscores some of the uncertainties around kratom use disorder diagnosis and treatment.

### Clinical assessment of the drug interaction potential of the psychotropic natural product kratom [^112JpvbX]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Low credibility.

Oral formulations prepared from the leaves of the kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) plant are increasingly used for their opioid-like effects to self-manage opioid withdrawal and pain. Calls to US poison centers involving kratom exposures increased more than 50-fold from 2011 to 2017, one-third of which reported concomitant use of kratom with drugs of abuse. Many of these drugs are eliminated primarily via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A and CYP2D6, raising concerns for potential adverse pharmacokinetic kratom-drug interactions.

The impact of a single low dose of kratom tea (2g) on the pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A probe midazolam (2.5mg) and CYP2D6 probe dextromethorphan (30mg) were assessed in 12 healthy adult participants after oral administration. Kratom showed no effect on dextromethorphan area under the plasma concentration time-curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (C max; geometric mean ratio [90% confidence interval] 0.99 [0.83–1.19] and 0.96 [0.78–1.19], respectively) but a modest increase in midazolam AUC and C max (1.39 [1.23–1.57] and 1.50 [1.32–1.70], respectively). Lack of change in midazolam half-life (1.07 [0.98–1.17]) suggested that kratom primarily inhibited intestinal CYP3A.

This inference was further supported by a physiologically based pharmacokinetic drug interaction model using the abundant alkaloid mitragynine, a relatively potent CYP3A time-dependent inhibitor in vitro (K I, ~4 μM; k inact, ~0.07 min⁻¹). This work is the first to clinically evaluate the pharmacokinetic drug interaction potential of kratom. Co-consuming kratom with certain drugs extensively metabolized by similar pathways could lead to altered drug effects and potential adverse outcomes.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^113f7ydV]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically in terms of the setting of care, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend using the ASAM Criteria Risk Assessment Matrix and withdrawal severity scales to determine the appropriate level of care for patients with AWS. It is important to recognize that most withdrawal severity scales reflect signs and symptoms and should not be used in isolation.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114s4FGr]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically concerning anticonvulsants, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend considering phenobarbital monotherapy. This should be managed by a clinician experienced with its use in outpatient settings with extensive monitoring. Phenobarbital can be an alternative to benzodiazepines, or when benzodiazepines are contraindicated, in patients with severe alcohol withdrawal or those at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal.

### Controversies in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of kratom use disorder [^114RivfP]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Should a KUD assessment be approached differently than other substances?

In prior publications, we have cautiously compared daily kratom use to daily caffeine use and KUD to caffeine addiction. Notably, a diagnosis of caffeine use disorder is forbidden by all DSM editions, although (or perhaps because) many caffeine users would likely meet SUD criteria, particularly per DSM-5 where only two criteria need be met. This differential treatment of caffeine may be due to uncertainty about whether caffeine-related problems constitute a "clinically significant disorder".

DSM-5 includes criteria to assess caffeine intoxication, caffeine withdrawal, unspecified caffeine-related disorder, and other caffeine-induced disorders (e.g. sleep and anxiety disorders). Such assessments may similarly be useful for other legal psychoactive substances like kratom, for which the psychosocial consequences of use are buffered by cultural acceptance of the substance or its typical effects. Caffeine and kratom product formulations vary considerably, are widely available, and, apart from scattered state and local kratom prohibitions, are not scheduled under the Controlled Substances Act by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. Thus, the net negative consequences of kratom or caffeine use are socially, culturally, and legally distinct from those of illicit drug use, which confers greater consequential hazard and higher possible DSM-5 criteria endorsement. At the time of writing, many kratom product formulations are primarily consumed orally in leaf-based formulations, with highly concentrated kratom extractions not fully detailed in the text.

### Controversies in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of kratom use disorder [^113yAyee]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

As part of the baseline workup for a patient with suspected kratom use disorder (KUD), we recommend obtaining not just a urine drug screen immunoassay, but also confirmatory testing with chromatography-mass spectrometry that can detect (and ideally, also quantitate) one or more kratom alkaloids. Typically, such testing will detect the most abundant kratom alkaloid, mitragynine, and sometimes also its more potent opioidergic metabolite, 7-hydroxymitragynine.

The importance of alkaloid-specific testing lies in the fact that kratom products are largely unstandardized and unregulated, carrying risks of adulteration, contamination, or substitution with other substances. With appropriate testing, both the clinician and the patient can be reassured that the patient with suspected KUD is actually taking kratom as believed, rather than some other substance or substance combination.

### Risk of death associated with kratom use compared to opioids [^116avHvE]. Preventive Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Kratom use appears to be increasing across the United States, drawing attention to deaths in which kratom use was detected. Most such deaths have been attributed to fentanyl, heroin, benzodiazepines, prescription opioids, cocaine, and other causes, such as homicide, suicide, and various preexisting diseases. Because kratom has certain opioid-like effects, such as pain relief, and is used by some people as a substitute for opioids for pain or addiction, it has been compared to "narcotic-like opioids", such as morphine, regarding the risk of death despite evidence that its primary alkaloid, mitragynine, carries few of the signature respiratory-depressing effects of morphine-like opioids.

This commentary summarizes animal toxicology data, surveys, and mortality data associated with opioids and kratom to provide a basis for estimating relative mortality risk. Population-level mortality estimates attributed to opioids compared to kratom are provided, as well as the per-user mortality risks. It appears that the risk of overdose death is more than 1,000 times greater for opioids than for kratom.

The limitations of the mortality risk estimate warrant caution in individuals with unknown factors such as the use of other substances and medications, or other preexisting conditions. More research on kratom safety and risks is needed, as is regulation of commercial kratom products to ensure that consumers are informed by FDA labeling and that kratom products are not contaminated or adulterated with other substances.

### Reducing the risk of withdrawal symptoms and relapse following clozapine discontinuation-is it feasible to develop evidence-based guidelines [^1165ekz1]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). Low credibility.

Clozapine is a dibenzodiazepine antipsychotic that was first developed in 1959. It is the only effective treatment for patients with schizophrenia who are treatment-resistant, and the most effective treatment for schizophrenia more generally. There are certain circumstances, however, where it is necessary to stop clozapine with estimates of discontinuation ranging between 16% and 66%. There are several reasons to stop clozapine; however, they can be broadly divided into indications leading to either emergency or elective discontinuation.

- **Emergency discontinuation**: This is typically indicated when patients experience potentially life-threatening adverse effects, such as agranulocytosis, myocarditis, or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. In some situations, clozapine can be reinitiated once the clinical concern has resolved or has been mitigated.

- **Elective discontinuation**: Examples include intolerable (but not immediately life-threatening) adverse effects, lack of treatment response, patient preference, and poor adherence. There are also some instances where clozapine can be discontinued after full recovery has been achieved. In contrast to stopping clozapine in an emergency, elective discontinuation usually allows a period of consultation, information gathering, and preparation as well as the option of stopping clozapine more gradually.

### A case of kratom use: Implications for managing addiction and addressing comorbidity in overdose survivors, and for the education of clinicians who are not addiction specialists [^112mWTpH]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Kratom use appears to be growing in the United States (US), though the true prevalence is largely unknown. One recent study estimated the prevalence of past-year kratom use in the US to be 0.8%, and the American Kratom Association reports that nearly 5 million individuals have used kratom. People who use kratom report a range of indications, including relief from opioid withdrawal, assistance in decreasing or tapering off prescribed or illicit opioids, treatment of pain and mental health symptoms such as anxiety, and recreational use. Kratom is marketed as an herbal drug derived from the Mitragyna speciosa tree and imported to the US from Southeast Asia. The primary psychoactive elements are the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, which behave as partial agonists at the mu-opioid receptor and as competitive antagonists of the delta and kappa opioid receptors. At low doses, kratom has a stimulatory effect, while at higher doses, it has a sedative and analgesic effect.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1134qwxL]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The ASAM 2020 guidelines on medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically regarding indications for pharmacotherapy and outpatient treatment, recommend considering the initiation of pharmacotherapy in an outpatient setting. This is at the discretion of providers with extensive experience in managing alcohol withdrawal for patients experiencing severe, but not complicated, alcohol withdrawal, indicated by a CIWA-Ar score of 19 or higher.

- **Pharmacotherapy recommendations**:
	- Administer benzodiazepines as first-line therapy.
	- Administer phenobarbital as an alternative option, reserved for providers experienced with its use.
	- Use phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or gabapentin in cases where benzodiazepines are contraindicated.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^111JEAzC]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly concerning clinical assessment, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend assessing whether the patient is at risk of developing severe and/or complicated alcohol withdrawal or complications arising from alcohol withdrawal. The use of a validated risk assessment scale, in conjunction with an assessment of individual risk factors as well as signs and symptoms, is advised.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114E3L4E]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly concerning indications for pharmacotherapy in an outpatient setting, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend initiating pharmacotherapy for patients at risk of developing new or worsening signs or symptoms of withdrawal while away from the outpatient treatment environment. Key risk factors include a history of withdrawal episodes of at least moderate severity and being within the timeframe for symptom development during the withdrawal process.

- **Pharmacotherapy recommendations**: Administer benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin as monotherapy. As an alternative strategy, administer at least a single dose of benzodiazepine followed by ongoing treatment according to symptom severity.

- **Patient reassessment**: Reassess patients frequently over the next 24 hours to monitor their need for withdrawal medication, especially if the risk of developing worse withdrawal symptoms is uncertain.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1121KCmu]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly in the context of managing withdrawal delirium, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend considering the use of barbiturates as an alternative to benzodiazepines. Although barbiturates are suggested, they are not preferred over benzodiazepines. The guidelines also advise the consideration of administering phenobarbital as an adjunct to benzodiazepines in closely monitored settings when alcohol withdrawal delirium is not adequately controlled by benzodiazepines alone.

### A case of 7-OH mitragynine use requiring inpatient medically managed withdrawal [^114kJsDJ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

There is an increased interest in kratom and kratom-related products such as 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH). Here we present the case of a patient seeking inpatient substance use treatment for daily 7-OH use and the clinical course of care, including Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) and medication treatment response.

This is a single case report from an inpatient medically managed withdrawal level of substance use treatment care.

A 38-year-old man with a history of opioid use disorder reported escalation of use, including kratom to 7-OH, complicated by the development of use disorder, tolerance, and withdrawal. The patient experienced a withdrawal syndrome consistent with opioid withdrawal upon stopping use, with COWS peaking at 14. The patient was treated with a short course of buprenorphine sublingual (daily dosing 2–8 mg) based on signs and symptoms. He did not want to remain on buprenorphine after the medically managed withdrawal period and was successfully tapered off buprenorphine during his treatment stay and transitioned to a residential level of care.

Given the widespread availability of kratom and kratom-related products, it is important for healthcare providers to screen for use and development of use disorder and be prepared to provide counseling, support, and treatment for patients.
