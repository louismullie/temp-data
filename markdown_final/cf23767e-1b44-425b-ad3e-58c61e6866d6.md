## Question

How much folic acid prevents melanoma recurrence?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much folic acid, if any, prevents melanoma recurrence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether there is direct clinical evidence (trials or cohorts) that folic acid reduces melanoma recurrence. Then, I should verify whether major melanoma guidelines endorse folic acid for recurrence prevention. Next, I will examine indirect oncologic evidence on folic acid and cancer recurrence risk, including mechanistic data about unmetabolized folic acid. After that, I need to consider dosing ranges used for other indications and safety constraints, and whether any subgroup biology (e.g. MTHFR) is relevant. Finally, I will synthesize a clinical bottom line and practical counseling points for surveillance and proven therapies, ensuring I have not missed any contrary evidence in the references provided [^1149fLqr] [^1133HJHg] [^111MgeHi].

> Let me first confirm the presence or absence of direct evidence. I need to check for randomized trials, cohort studies, or guideline statements specifically testing folic acid to prevent melanoma recurrence; wait, let me verify the nutrition and melanoma prevention reviews and umbrella analyses. Those reviews emphasize that human randomized trials of dietary supplements for melanoma prevention are lacking, and folic acid is not identified as an evidence-based agent for melanoma recurrence prevention, which supports that there are no direct RCTs or cohorts establishing efficacy for this purpose [^111MgeHi] [^116wpMsg] [^116jeNxx]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there might have been a supplement trial showing benefit; hold on, the ViDMe trial actually tested high-dose vitamin D and was negative for relapse-free survival, and it does not involve folic acid, underscoring how prior biologically plausible supplements have not translated into reduced melanoma relapse in RCTs [^117BbGNC].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines to ensure I'm not missing a recommendation. The AAD 2019 guidelines stress that regular clinical follow-up with history and physical examination is the most important means of detecting cutaneous melanoma recurrence, with no recommendation for folic acid or other nutritional supplements for recurrence prevention; let me double-check that wording, yes, it centers on surveillance and appropriate imaging/labs as indicated, not supplements [^1149fLqr]. I will now examine ESMO 2025 and ASCO 2023 guidance; they delineate evidence-based adjuvant and systemic therapies (e.g., immune checkpoint inhibitors, and BRAF/MEK inhibition where appropriate) and do not list folic acid as a preventive or adjuvant measure for recurrence reduction [^1133HJHg] [^115FfyPj] [^1177tdPX]. To round out prevention counseling, USPSTF recommendations emphasize UV risk-reduction counseling for primary prevention, again with no role for folic acid in melanoma management or recurrence prevention [^1145oyGH] [^111RNnnv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; absence of melanoma-specific data doesn't inherently prove harm or lack of benefit, so I should check indirect oncologic signals from other cancers and mechanistic lines of evidence. Multiple trials and analyses in colorectal neoplasia suggest that supplemental folic acid at 1 mg/day does not reduce adenoma recurrence and may increase the risk of advanced or multiple adenomas over longer follow-up, which raises a biologically plausible concern about promoting neoplastic clones in certain contexts [^115QJ2cX] [^1121obZh] [^1119HrjT]. I should confirm if any recurrence signal appears in other cancers; yes, in non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer, higher synthetic folic acid intake correlated with increased tumor recurrence risk, while natural dietary folate did not show the same pattern, suggesting a potential differential effect between synthetic folic acid and food folates [^1135rBWj]. Let me also verify broader cancer safety data; in ischemic heart disease patients, folic acid plus B12 was associated with increased cancer incidence and cancer mortality compared with controls, adding to the cautionary signal, though confounding by indication and population context must be considered [^113qidmv].

> I should now consider mechanistic plausibility and dose. Excess synthetic folic acid can accumulate as unmetabolized folic acid, potentially fueling DNA synthesis and proliferation in pre-neoplastic or neoplastic cells and altering immune function in non-linear ways; this could, at least theoretically, promote growth of existing lesions rather than prevent recurrence in a cancer survivor, depending on context and timing [^112ye7HN]. Wait, let me reconsider an earlier thought that "more folate might improve immune surveillance"; the evidence actually shows a bell-shaped response of NK cell activity with both low and high folate intake associated with reduced cytotoxicity, cautioning against assuming benefit from high-dose supplementation in oncology populations without disease-specific evidence [^112ye7HN].

> But what about patient-specific folate metabolism, like MTHFR? I need to check whether MTHFR polymorphisms justify targeted supplementation for melanoma control; data indicate MTHFR variants modulate folate bioavailability and DNA methylation, but there is no melanoma-specific evidence that correcting genotype-influenced folate status prevents recurrence, so using this to justify folic acid for melanoma is speculative at best [^115VWqAm]. I should confirm diagnostic practice points: when evaluating folate status, measure cobalamin concurrently to avoid masking B12 deficiency, a known risk of folic acid supplementation, especially at higher doses [^112Gfisa].

> Let me think about dosing ranges and safety constraints to avoid conflating established indications with unproven oncology use. For neural tube defect prevention, established public health recommendations are 400–800 mcg/day periconceptionally for those who can become pregnant, and 4 mg/day for certain high-risk pregnancies, but these indications do not apply to melanoma recurrence prevention, and extrapolating them to melanoma would be inappropriate without evidence [^115tN8Zc] [^112bXHkk] [^116hvZfQ] [^11118rKA]. I should double-check safety labeling; folic acid above 0.1 mg daily can mask pernicious anemia and interacts with some anticonvulsants, reinforcing that supplementation is not risk-free and should be purpose-driven rather than assumed benign in cancer survivorship [^115RPuGb] [^1135fGzx].

> I will now examine whether any melanoma-related treatment context requires folate supplementation that could be misconstrued as "preventing recurrence". Certain antifolate chemotherapies, such as pralatrexate, intentionally co-administer folic acid and vitamin B12 to mitigate treatment-related myelosuppression and mucositis, but this is toxicity prophylaxis specific to an antifolate regimen and has nothing to do with preventing melanoma recurrence per se [^113zsTBe]. Hold on, I should verify that leucovorin cautions don't alter this point; indeed, excessive folinate can counteract antifolate chemotherapy, underscoring that folate pathway modulation is pharmacologically active and must be indication-specific, not generalized for cancer prevention without evidence [^117Pxx1D] [^116MotDT].

> Before concluding, I need to ensure I haven't overlooked population intake context or inadvertent high exposure. In the US, many individuals already consume folic acid from fortified foods and supplements, and a substantial fraction surpasses the tolerable upper intake; in the absence of melanoma-specific benefit and given the theoretical and observed oncologic cautions above, routine additional high-dose folic acid for a melanoma survivor lacks a favorable risk–benefit rationale [^1173MaX3]. I should confirm once more that melanoma nutrition reviews and major guidelines do not endorse folic acid for recurrence prevention; they do not, and emphasize established surveillance and evidence-based systemic therapies instead [^111MgeHi] [^1149fLqr] [^1133HJHg] [^1177tdPX].

> Synthesis and clinical bottom line: There is no established dose of folic acid that prevents melanoma recurrence, and no guideline endorses its use for this purpose; indirect evidence from other cancers suggests potential harm at higher supplemental doses, and mechanistic data raise plausible concerns about promoting neoplastic growth in certain settings, so folic acid should not be recommended for melanoma recurrence prevention outside a clinical trial [^111MgeHi] [^1135rBWj] [^115QJ2cX] [^1121obZh] [^1119HrjT] [^113qidmv]. Wait, I should verify that standard-of-care strategies are clearly stated; yes, prioritize guideline-based surveillance and, where indicated, adjuvant or systemic therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibition or BRAF/MEK inhibitors, tailored to disease stage and mutation status, rather than unproven supplementation [^1149fLqr] [^1133HJHg] [^115FfyPj] [^1177tdPX].

> Practical counseling summary: I need to ensure the patient understands that, based on current evidence, folic acid cannot be recommended to prevent melanoma recurrence, and that high-dose supplementation may carry theoretical and observed risks in oncology contexts; reinforce UV risk-reduction behaviors for primary prevention, maintain regular melanoma follow-up, and discuss evidence-based adjuvant options with oncology if appropriate, while reserving folate supplementation for established indications such as deficiency correction or regimen-specific antifolate toxicity mitigation [^1145oyGH] [^111RNnnv] [^1149fLqr] [^113zsTBe].

There is **no evidence** that folic acid supplementation prevents melanoma recurrence, and clinical guidelines do not recommend it for this purpose [^1149fLqr] [^115FfyPj]. Available data show **no benefit** for melanoma outcomes, and some studies suggest high-dose folic acid may increase recurrence risk in other cancers [^111MgeHi] [^115QJ2cX] [^1135rBWj] [^1121obZh]. Patients with melanoma should **avoid high-dose folic acid supplements** and **follow standard surveillance** [^1149fLqr] and **sun protection measures** [^1145oyGH].

---

## Evidence on folic acid and melanoma recurrence

- **Lack of direct evidence**: There are no randomized controlled trials or observational studies specifically evaluating folic acid supplementation and melanoma recurrence [^114pyAG3].

- **Indirect evidence from other cancers**: High-dose folic acid (≥ 1 mg/day) has been linked to increased recurrence or progression in colorectal and bladder cancers, raising concern about potential harm in melanoma [^115QJ2cX] [^1135rBWj].

- **No demonstrated benefit**: No studies show folic acid reduces melanoma recurrence or improves survival [^1149fLqr].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Major guidelines from the AAD, ESMO, and ASCO make **no recommendation for folic acid supplementation** to prevent melanoma recurrence. Instead, they **focus on established preventive measures**, emphasizing regular clinical follow-up [^1149fLqr], sun protection [^1145oyGH], and patient education rather than supplements.

---

## Potential risks of folic acid supplementation in melanoma patients

- **Possible promotion of tumor growth**: High-dose folic acid may promote growth of existing neoplastic cells, potentially increasing recurrence risk [^112ye7HN] [^113qidmv].

- **Masking of vitamin B12 deficiency**: Folic acid can mask B12 deficiency, leading to neurological complications [^1135fGzx] [^115RPuGb].

- **Interaction with cancer therapies**: Folic acid may interfere with antifolate chemotherapies, potentially reducing efficacy [^111Sc8Ey].

---

## Current standard of care for melanoma recurrence prevention

- **Regular clinical follow-up**: Routine follow-up [^1149fLqr] with history, physical exam, and targeted imaging is recommended.

- **Sun protection and behavioral counseling**: UV avoidance [^1145oyGH] and sun protection [^111RNnnv] are key preventive strategies.

- **Adjuvant therapies**: Immune checkpoint inhibitors and BRAF/MEK inhibitors [^1133HJHg] are used in high-risk patients [^1177tdPX].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no evidence** that folic acid supplementation prevents melanoma recurrence; therefore, it should not be used for this purpose. High-dose folic acid has been associated with increased recurrence risk in other cancers and could be harmful in melanoma. Patients should **follow established guidance** on surveillance [^1149fLqr], sun protection [^1145oyGH], and adjuvant therapy when indicated [^1177tdPX].

### Is folic acid safe for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients? An evidence-based cohort study [^1135rBWj]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with cancer are highly concerned about food choices and dietary supplements that may affect their treatment outcomes. Excess folic acid (synthetic folate) from supplements or fortification can lead to the accumulation of unmetabolized folic acid in the systemic circulation and urine and may promote cancer growth, especially among those with neoplastic alterations.

- **Objective**: We investigated the prospective association between synthetic compared with natural folate intake and clinical outcomes in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), which is a highly recurrent disease.

- **Design**: In a cohort of 619 NMIBC patients, folate intake at diagnosis was assessed with a previously validated food-frequency questionnaire and categorized according to tertiles. After a median follow-up of 5.2 years, 303 tumor recurrence and 108 progression events were documented from medical record reviews. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards and logistic models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

- **Results**: Synthetic folic acid intake was positively associated with a risk of recurrence among NMIBC patients (medium compared with low intake-HR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.20, 2.48; P = 0.003; high compared with low intake-HR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.14, 2.84; P = 0.01). Patients with a higher folic acid intake were more likely to have multifocal tumors at diagnosis (medium or high compared with low-OR: 2.08; 95% CI: 1.08, 4.02; P = 0.03). In contrast, natural folate intake tended to be inversely associated with the risk of progression.

### Behavioral counseling to prevent skin cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^1145oyGH]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for cutaneous melanoma, specifically in the context of primary prevention, the USPSTF 2018 guidelines recommend counseling individuals with fair skin types, particularly those aged 6 months to 24 years, as well as parents of young children, about minimizing exposure to UV radiation to reduce the risk of skin cancer.

### Guidelines of care for the management of primary cutaneous melanoma [^1149fLqr]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cutaneous melanoma, more specifically concerning follow-up, the AAD 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining regular clinical follow-up as the most important means of detecting CM recurrence. The follow-up assessment should include the patient's history (review of systems) and physical examination to direct the need for further radiologic or laboratory studies to detect local, regional, and distant metastatic disease.

### Folate dietary insufficiency and folic acid supplementation similarly impair metabolism and compromise hematopoiesis [^112ye7HN]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Dietary folate levels have been linked to cancer risk in a puzzling way; dietary folate deficiency has been associated with increased risk of some cancers, while excessive folic acid supplementation may also be associated with increased cancer risks. For example, an inverse correlation between folate intake and the risk of colorectal adenocarcinomas has been supported by some studies carried out in both mice and humans. In contrast, other trials indicate that folic acid supplementation (1 mg/day) after detection of polyps or in individuals with a history of colorectal adenoma is associated with increased progression to, or recurrence of, adenomas — a connection further supported by mouse studies. Moreover, a reversal in the downward trend of colorectal cancer incidence in the United States and Canada is evident, starting in 1996 and coinciding with the onset of folate supplementation in these countries. Another clinical trial showed that supplementation with folic acid plus vitamin B12 increased cancer incidence and all-cause mortality in patients with ischemic heart disease. Nonetheless, other studies have failed to observe such associations, and differences in supplementation and the myriad of other genetic, dietary, and lifestyle complications likely contribute to the lack of clear associations.

Both low and high levels of dietary folate have been shown to negatively impact immune function in humans. A study of postmenopausal women describes a bell-shaped curve for folate intake and natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity, with reduced NK cell activity in both low and high intake groups.

### Impact of folic acid supplementation on the epigenetic profile in healthy unfortified individuals - a randomized intervention trial [^115VWqAm]. Epigenetics (2024). High credibility.

5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a regulatory enzyme of one-carbon metabolism and is essential for the conversion of folic acid, thus regulating folate bioavailability. The common variant (MTHFR)-C677T has reduced enzyme activity, which decreases blood folate concentrations and increases intake requirements among carriers. The MTHFR genotype affects the relationship of folate concentration with both DNA replication (cell division/survival) and DNA methylation (cell regulation).

European countries generally have not participated in fortification programs, such as the fluoridation of drinking water or the fortification of milk with vitamins A and D, leaving decisions about supplementation to the consumer. Consequently, European countries have not adopted folic acid fortification despite a high incidence of neural tube defects. In Germany, folate deficiency is common, and folic acid supplementation is low. According to the German National Nutrition Survey II, the median dietary folate equivalents in Germany are 191 µg/d for men and 168 µg/d for women. More than half of all Germans consume less than 200 µg of folate. The German Society of Nutrition recommends a daily intake of 300 µg of folate for adults. All women planning to become pregnant are advised to follow a diet rich in folate-containing foods and to take a supplement containing at least 400 µg of folic acid daily, starting at least four weeks prior to pregnancy and continuing until the end of the first trimester.

### Aspirin and folic acid for the prevention of recurrent colorectal adenomas [^116opNrp]. Gastroenterology (2008). High credibility.

Although observational studies have found regular aspirin use to be associated with a reduced risk of colorectal neoplasia, results from randomized trials using aspirin have been inconsistent. Dietary folate intake also has been found to be associated with a reduced risk of colorectal neoplasms in observational studies.

- **Methods**: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial of aspirin (300 mg/day) and folate supplements (0.5 mg/day) to prevent colorectal adenoma recurrence was performed using a 2 x 2 factorial design. All patients had an adenoma (≥ 0.5 cm) removed in the 6 months before recruitment and were followed-up at 4-month intervals with a second colonoscopy after approximately 3 years. The primary outcome measure was a colorectal adenoma diagnosed after baseline.

- **Results**: A total of 945 patients were recruited into the study, of whom 853 (90.3%) underwent a second colonoscopy. In total, 99 (22.8%) of 434 patients receiving aspirin had a recurrent adenoma compared to 121 (28.9%) of 419 patients receiving placebo (relative risk, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.63–0.99). A total of 104 patients developed an advanced colorectal adenoma; 41 (9.4%) of these were in the aspirin group and 63 (15.0%) were in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43–0.91). Folate supplementation was found to have no effect on adenoma recurrence (relative risk, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.85–1.34).

- **Conclusions**: Aspirin (300 mg/day) but not folate (0.5 mg/day) use was found to reduce the risk of colorectal adenoma recurrence, with evidence that aspirin could have.

### Total folate and folic acid intake from foods and dietary supplements in the United States: 2003–2006 [^1173MaX3]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

The term "total folate intake" is used to represent folate that occurs naturally in food, as well as folic acid from fortified foods and dietary supplements. Folic acid has been referred to as a double-edged sword because of its beneficial role in the prevention of neural tube defects and its possible deleterious effects on certain cancers and cognitive function. Previous monitoring efforts did not include folic acid from dietary supplements and are therefore incomplete.

- **Objective**: Our objective was to combine data on dietary folate (as measured by two 24-hour recalls) and folic acid from dietary supplements (collected with a 30-day frequency questionnaire) using the bias-corrected best power method to adjust for within-person variability.

- **Design**: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey. Linear contrasts were constructed to determine differences in dietary and total folate intake for age and racial-ethnic groups by sex; prevalence of inadequate and excessive intakes is presented.

- **Results**: In 2003–2006, 53% of the US population used dietary supplements, and 34.5% used dietary supplements containing folic acid. Total folate intake (in dietary folate equivalents) was higher for men (813 ± 14) than for women (724 ± 16) and higher for non-Hispanic whites (827 ± 19) than for Mexican Americans (615 ± 11) and non-Hispanic blacks (597 ± 12); 29% of non-Hispanic black women had inadequate intakes. Total folate and folic acid intakes are highest for those aged ≥ 50 years.

### Cutaneous melanoma: ESMO clinical practice guideline for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^1133HJHg]. Annals of Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for cutaneous melanoma, specifically with respect to the management of advanced or metastatic disease as first-line therapy, ESMO 2025 guidelines recommend considering the offer of BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy. This is applicable if the patient is more than three months after discontinuing adjuvant BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy, or chemotherapy as first-line treatment, in patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma. It is particularly for those who have relapsed on or within six months of adjuvant BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy and who have an immediate or absolute contraindication to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

### High-dose vitamin D supplementation does not improve outcome in a cutaneous melanoma population: Results of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study (ViDMe trial) [^117BbGNC]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Observational studies in cutaneous melanoma (CM) have indicated an inverse relationship between levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and Breslow thickness, in addition to a protective effect of high 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels on clinical outcome.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate whether high-dose vitamin D supplementation in curatively resected CM reduces melanoma relapse.

- **Methods**: In a prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 436 patients with resected CM stage IA to III (8th American Joint Committee on Cancer staging) were randomized. Among them, 218 received a placebo, while 218 received monthly 100,000 IU cholecalciferol for a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of 42 months (treatment arm). Following randomization, patients were followed for a median of 52 months, with a maximum follow-up of 116 months. The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival. Secondary endpoints were melanoma-related mortality, overall survival, and the evolution of 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum levels over time.

- **Results**: In our population (mean age 55 years, 54% female sex), vitamin D supplementation increased 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum levels after 6 months of supplementation in the treatment arm by a median of 17 ng/mL [95% confidence interval (CI) 9–26] compared with 0 ng/mL (95% CI 6–8) in the placebo arm (P < 0.001, Wilcoxon test) and remained at a steady state during the whole treatment period. The estimated event rate for relapse-free survival at 72 months after inclusion was 26.51% in the vitamin D supplemented arm (95% CI 19.37–35.64) vs. 20.70% (95% CI 14.26–29.52) in the placebo arm.

### Adjuvant bevacizumab for melanoma patients at high risk of recurrence: Survival analysis of the AVAST-M trial [^115fohR5]. Annals of Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

The AVAST-M trial randomized 1,343 patients with resected high-risk cutaneous melanoma to receive either adjuvant bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg i.v. every 3 weeks for 1 year) or standard observation. Adjuvant bevacizumab significantly improved the disease-free interval but did not improve overall survival. BRAF mutation status predicted poorer overall survival when untreated and indicated potential benefit from bevacizumab.

### How well do blood folate concentrations predict dietary folate intakes in a sample of Canadian lactating women exposed to high levels of folate? An observational study [^111SRbnj]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2007). Low credibility.

Total dietary folate intakes are expressed in the manuscript, except where indicated, as "Dietary Folate Equivalents" [μg/d DFE = natural folate, μg + (1.7 × of supplemental folate, μg)] to adjust for the greater bioavailability of synthetic (added as a fortificant or supplemental) folate relative to endogenous sources. For ease of interpretation, no adjustment was made to account for bioavailability of synthetic folate intakes when reported alone (e.g. expressed as μg/d, not μg/d DFE).

### Folic acid supplementation and risk of colorectal neoplasia during long-term follow-up of a randomized clinical trial [^1121obZh]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

The Aspirin/Folate Polyp Prevention Study previously found folic acid increased the risk of advanced and multiple colorectal adenomas during a surveillance colonoscopy interval starting about three years after randomization.

- **Objective**: We conducted secondary analyses to evaluate folic acid effects with additional follow-up after treatment was stopped.

- **Methods**: A total of 1021 participants recently diagnosed with colorectal adenomas were randomly assigned to 1 mg/day of folic acid (n = 516) or placebo (n = 505), with or without aspirin, beginning July 6, 1994. The original three-year treatment period was extended into a subsequent colonoscopy interval, but eventually stopped prematurely on October 1, 2004. With additional post-treatment follow-up, a total of 663 participants who extended treatment completed a second colonoscopic surveillance interval after the initial three-year follow-up. In addition, 490 participants provided information regarding a subsequent surveillance colonoscopy occurring before the completion of follow-up on May 31, 2012, including 325 who had agreed to extended treatment. Study endpoints included conventional adenomas, sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/Ps), or colorectal cancer, and relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were adjusted for baseline characteristics associated with the availability of follow-up.

- **Results**: Among those who extended treatment, any colorectal neoplasia was found in 118 (36%) participants assigned to placebo and 146 (43%) assigned to folic acid during the second surveillance interval (RR: 1.21; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.47; P = 0.06). Increased risk of SSA/P with extended folic acid use was noted.

### Non-genetic risk factors for cutaneous melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancers: An umbrella review of meta-analyses [^116jeNxx]. Journal of Dermatological Science (2016). Low credibility.

Skin cancers have a complex disease mechanism, involving both genetic and non-genetic risk factors. Numerous meta-analyses have been published claiming statistically significant associations between non-genetic risk factors and skin cancers without applying a thorough methodological assessment.

- **Objective**: The present study maps the literature on the non-genetic risk factors of skin cancers, assesses the presence of statistical biases, and identifies the associations with robust evidence.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed up to January 20, 2016, to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies that examined associations between non-genetic factors and skin cancers. For each meta-analysis, we estimated the summary effect size using random-effects and fixed-effects models, with the 95% confidence interval and the 95% prediction interval. We also assessed the between-study heterogeneity (I² metric), evidence for small-study effects, and excess significance bias.

- **Results**: Forty-four eligible papers were identified, including a total of 85 associations. Twenty-one associations were significant at P < 10⁻⁶. Fifty-two associations had large or very large heterogeneity. Evidence for small-study effects and excess significance bias was found in fifteen and thirteen associations, respectively. Overall, thirteen associations (actinic keratosis, serum vitamin D, sunburns, and hair color for basal cell carcinoma and density of freckles, eye color, hair color, history of melanoma, skin type, sunburns, premalignant skin lesions, common and atypical nevi for melanoma).

### The search for a chemoprevention agent effective against melanoma: Considerations and challenges [^116TpFkz]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Studies examining the potential chemopreventive properties of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) against melanoma report widely varying results. The construction and interpretation of these studies are hampered by many factors, including limited knowledge of the pathogenesis of melanoma, leading to difficulties in determining the relevant factors in the administration of chemopreventive agents and difficulties in assessing the long-term use of nonprescription medications. The study by Curiel-Lewandrowski et al. reported in this issue is an important contribution to the literature, but the final verdict regarding the chemopreventive properties of NSAIDs against melanoma is yet to come.

### Folic acid supplementation, dietary folate intake during pregnancy and risk for spontaneous preterm delivery: a prospective observational cohort study [^114fVksn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

One possible explanation for these conflicting results could be the dosage of folic acid. While most of the studies finding an association with gestational length or PTD were based on high doses of folic acid (≥ 5000 μg/d, ≥ 2500 μg/d, and ≥ 500 μg/d), only 2 women in our study population consumed as much as 5000 μg/d of supplemental folic acid, while only 10% consumed > 500 μg/d and 16% consumed > 400 μg/d. However, the Hungarian RCT, one of the biggest performed so far, did not find any effect of a high dosage of 800 μg/d of periconceptional folic acid supplementation on PTD. Unfortunately, the folic acid dosage was not indicated in all of the studies.

The assessment of folate intake from supplementation alone or when studying populations with different dietary folate intakes are additional factors compromising comparability between studies. While recent US studies are performed against the background of mandatory folate fortification of food, other studies have examined supplementation effects in folate-deficient populations. Few studies have assessed the effects of both dietary folate and folic acid supplementation separately or combined, and adjustments for bioavailability are rare. In this Norwegian study population, only 3% of the participants reached the Nordic Nutrition Recommendation of 500 μg/d with their dietary folate intake, and 44% of the participants achieved the recommended level with their dietary folate and supplemental folic acid intake. After stratification for dietary folate intake, the early initiation of folic acid supplementation was significantly associated.

Excessive amounts of leucovorin may nullify the chemotherapeutic effect of folic acid antagonists.

### Aso author reflections: Stage-adjusted reduced follow-up of melanoma patients is justified and cost effective, until biomarkers to predict prognosis have been identified [^116kjjbD]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

The incredible rise in melanoma health care costs urgently demands a reduction in these costs where appropriate. Nevertheless, cancer patients demand frequent and close follow-up out of fear of recurrence. Historically, melanoma patients have been followed regularly, with limited therapeutic options in case of disease progression. In addition, survival benefit as a result of follow-up has never been demonstrated. There is a lack of international consensus regarding the follow-up frequency of melanoma patients, and evidence regarding the optimal follow-up frequency of these patients with respect to disease-free and overall survival, patients' quality of life (QoL), and costs is highly needed.

### Total folate and folic acid intakes from foods and dietary supplements of US children aged 1–13 y [^1126Y1cm]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Total folate intake includes naturally occurring food folate and folic acid from fortified foods and dietary supplements. Recent reports have focused on total folate intakes of persons aged ≥ 14 years; however, information on total folate intakes of young children is limited.

- **Objective**: The objective was to compute total folate and total folic acid intakes of US children aged 1–13 years using a statistical method that adjusts for within-person variability. The study aimed to compare these intakes with the Dietary Reference Intake guidelines for adequacy and excess.

- **Design**: Data from the 2003–2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey, were analyzed. Total folate intakes were derived by combining intakes of food folate (naturally occurring and folic acid from fortified foods) based on 24-hour dietary recall results and folic acid intakes from dietary supplements based on a 30-day questionnaire.

- **Results**: More than 95% of US children consumed at least the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) for folate from foods alone. More than one-third (35%) of US children aged 1–13 years used dietary supplements, and 28% used dietary supplements containing folic acid. Supplement users had significantly higher total folate and folic acid intakes than nonusers. More than half (53%) of dietary supplement users exceeded the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for total folic acid (fortified food + supplements) compared with 5% of nonusers.

- **Conclusions**: Total folate intakes of most US children aged 1–13 years meet the EAR.

### Folic acid supplementation, dietary folate intake during pregnancy and risk for spontaneous preterm delivery: a prospective observational cohort study [^116aka5g]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

The overall amount of dietary folate and supplemental folic acid intake during the first half of pregnancy in 66,014 singleton pregnancies from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study was not associated with a decreased or increased risk of spontaneous preterm delivery (PTD), at least not at the relatively low intake levels of dietary folate (median 157 μg/d corrected for bioavailability, uncorrected 262 μg/d) and supplemental folic acid (median 143 μg/d) in this healthy study population.

The initiation of folic acid supplementation more than 8 weeks prior to conception was associated with an increased risk for overall and early spontaneous PTD in both the overall analyses and in the strata of women with low dietary folate intake. Even if the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) allows adjustment for a variety of confounders, the presence of residual confounding cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, our results require careful investigation regarding the dosage and timing of folic acid supplementation, such as in the form of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) before discussing a change in the guidelines.

### Folic acid and folinic acid for reducing side effects in patients receiving methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis [^112RhRpp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). High credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX) is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) used as a first-line agent for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Pharmacologically, it is classified as an antimetabolite due to its antagonistic effect on folic acid metabolism. Many patients treated with MTX experience mucosal, gastrointestinal, hepatic, or hematologic side effects. Supplementation with folic or folinic acid during treatment with MTX may ameliorate these side effects.

- **Objectives**: To identify trials of supplementation with folic acid or folinic acid during MTX therapy for rheumatoid arthritis and to assess the benefits and harms of folic acid and folinic acid in (a) reducing the mucosal, gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic, and hematologic side effects of MTX and (b) evaluating whether folic or folinic acid supplementation has any effect on MTX benefit.

- **Search methods**: We originally performed MEDLINE searches from January 1966 to June 1999. During the update of this review, we searched additional databases and used a sensitive search strategy designed to retrieve all trials on folic acid or folinic acid for rheumatoid arthritis from 1999 up to March 2, 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected all double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) in which adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis were treated with MTX (at a dose equal to or less than 25 mg/week) concurrently with folate supplementation. In this update of the review, we only included trials using 'low dose' folic or folinic acid (a starting dose of ≤ 7 mg weekly).

### Effect of homocysteine-lowering treatment with folic acid and B vitamins on risk of type 2 diabetes in women: a randomized, controlled trial [^111rzMW1]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

In this large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 7.3 years of treatment among 4,252 women at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), we found no significant effect of homocysteine-lowering treatment by a combination pill of folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12 on the risk of type 2 diabetes. There remained no evidence for a treatment effect in a sensitivity analysis restricted to women compliant with their study pills over the follow-up period. Our study provides the first randomized trial data regarding the long-term effect of folic acid/B vitamin supplementation on the risk of type 2 diabetes, although our findings remain to be corroborated by future research.

It has been hypothesized that B vitamins may help reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by ameliorating metabolic abnormalities, such as oxidative damage, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction, which characterize all phases of insulin resistance and pancreatic β-cell function and are implicated in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes. Due to their relative safety and low cost, B vitamin supplements have been targeted as potential therapeutic agents in previous randomized controlled trials for the prevention of vascular diseases in high-risk populations. In contrast, direct evidence from randomized trials of B vitamin supplementation for type 2 diabetes has been very limited. Some, but not all, secondary prevention trials have suggested that folic acid supplementation may be effective in the improvement of oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Folotyn [^113zsTBe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Myelosuppression**: Folotyn can cause myelosuppression, manifested by thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and/or anemia. Administer vitamin B12 and instruct patients to take folic acid to reduce the risk of treatment-related myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Monitor complete blood counts and omit and/or reduce the dose based on ANC and platelet count prior to each dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

- **Mucositis**: Folotyn can cause mucositis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Administer vitamin B12 and instruct patients to take folic acid to reduce the risk of mucositis [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Monitor for mucositis weekly and omit and/or reduce the dose for grade 2 or higher mucositis [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

- **Dermatologic reactions**: Folotyn can cause severe dermatologic reactions, which may result in death. These reactions have been reported in clinical studies (2.1% of 663 patients) and post-marketing experiences, including skin exfoliation, ulceration, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. They may progress and increase in severity with further treatment and may involve skin and subcutaneous sites of known lymphoma. Monitor closely for dermatologic reactions. Withhold or discontinue Folotyn based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

- **Tumor lysis syndrome**: Folotyn can cause tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Monitor patients who are at increased risk of TLS and treat promptly.

- **Hepatic toxicity**: Folotyn can cause hepatic toxicity.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cutaneous melanoma, specifically in assessing cutaneous toxicity, the AAD 2019 guidelines recommend ensuring collaboration between dermatologists and oncologists. This collaboration is crucial for managing cutaneous toxicity during BRAF/MEK kinase or immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Appropriate recognition and control of skin side effects may improve the quality of life for patients with cutaneous melanoma and help avoid unnecessary interruptions of medication.

### Folate intake and the risk of prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116dxxRr]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

There is conflicting evidence regarding the role of folate in the risk of developing prostate cancer. We performed a systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis of folate blood levels and folate intake, and the risk of prostate cancer. Four electronic databases (Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Contents Connect) were searched up to 11 October 2013, with no language restrictions for observational studies that measured folate intake or blood levels, and the risk of prostate cancer. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model.

The dietary folate meta-analysis, comprising 11 studies with 15,336 cases and a total sample size of 146,782, found no statistically significant association with prostate cancer, with an OR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.89–1.06). The total folate meta-analysis, comprising 5 studies with 7,114 cases and a total sample size of 93,781, also found no statistically significant association with prostate cancer, with an OR of 0.99 (95% CI 0.82–1.19).

The blood folate meta-analysis, comprising seven studies with 6,122 cases and a total sample size of 10,232, found an increased risk of prostate cancer with high blood folate levels, with an OR of 1.43 (95% CI 1.06–1.93). There was significant heterogeneity (I(2) = 79.5%, P < 0.01). Removal of an outlier study eliminated the heterogeneity (I(2) = 0.0%, P = 0.54), and the association remained significant with an OR of 1.14 (95% CI 1.02–1.28). Dietary and total folate intake do not appear to be significantly associated with the risk of prostate cancer. High blood folate levels, however, are associated with an increased risk.

### Is there a causal relationship between vitamin D and melanoma risk? A Mendelian randomization study [^1135q4rJ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Several preclinical studies have identified the antiproliferative effects of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D; vitamin D]. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is essential for vitamin D synthesis, yet it increases the risk of melanoma. Observational studies on the association of vitamin D levels with melanoma risk have reported inconclusive results and are difficult to interpret due to the potential confounding factor of UVR's dual role.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether there is a causal association between genetically predicted 25(OH)D concentrations and melanoma using a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach.

- **Methods**: We performed MR using summary data from a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of melanoma risk, consisting of 12,874 cases and 23,203 controls. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with 25(OH)D concentration — rs12785878, rs10741657, rs2282679, rs6013897, and rs116970203 — were selected as instrumental variables. An inverse variance weighted method was used to assess the evidence for causality. MR results from the melanoma meta-analysis were combined with results from an MR study based on a melanoma risk GWAS using UK Biobank data.

- **Results**: A 20 nmol/L decrease in 25(OH)D was not associated with melanoma risk [odds ratio (OR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95–1.19]. Results from the UK Biobank were concordant, with a meta-analysis of our and UK Biobank-derived MR causal estimates showing no association (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.92–1.13 for a 20 nmol/L decrease).

- **Conclusions**: The results suggest that vitamin D levels are not causally related to melanoma risk.

### Physiological need for calcium, iron, and folic acid for women of various subpopulations during pregnancy and beyond [^1125g4pU]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

Folate, or vitamin B9, is a water-soluble vitamin that the body utilizes to synthesize nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and to metabolize amino acids for cell growth. Although it is found in many foods, such as dark leafy greens, peas and beans, and fruits, many countries fortify grain and cereal products with folic acid (synthetic folate).

One of the benefits of folate when taken during pregnancy is the prevention of fetal neural tube defects (NTDs). Folate and folic acid also show benefits or potential benefits in the treatment of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, cancer and antiviral therapies, longer-term neurological development in infants, neurological status in adults, treatment of chronic diseases such as arthritis and sickle cell disease, reduction of the effects of radiation exposure, and improvement in neurocognitive function. They are also used as additives in various treatments and medications.

Although the benefits of folic acid supplementation in preventing NTDs are clear, some concerns are associated with increased folate and folic acid intake. Folic acid supplementation may mask an existing vitamin B12 deficiency. Additionally, some studies have linked excess folic acid intake with an increased risk of the development and recurrence of certain types of cancers.

No gender-specific differences in folate or folic acid metabolism or biological requirements for men and women have been reported, except to accommodate reproductive differences. The National Institutes of Health's Office of Dietary Supplements recommends identical folic acid intake requirements for men and women.

### Folic acid for the prevention of colorectal adenomas: a randomized clinical trial [^115QJ2cX]. JAMA (2007). High credibility.

Laboratory and epidemiological data suggest that folic acid may have an antineoplastic effect in the large intestine. The objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of folic acid supplementation for preventing colorectal adenomas.

This research was designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-factor, phase 3, randomized clinical trial. It was conducted at 9 clinical centers between July 6, 1994, and October 1, 2004. Participants included 1,021 men and women with a recent history of colorectal adenomas and no previous invasive large intestine carcinoma.

Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 1 mg/d of folic acid (n = 516) or a placebo (n = 505). They were also separately randomized to receive aspirin (81 or 325 mg/d) or a placebo. Follow-up consisted of two colonoscopic surveillance cycles; the first interval was at 3 years, and the second occurred 3 or 5 years later.

The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of at least one colorectal adenoma. Secondary outcomes included the occurrence of advanced lesions (defined as having ≥ 25% villous features, high-grade dysplasia, size ≥ 1 cm, or invasive cancer) and adenoma multiplicity (0, 1–2, or ≥ 3 adenomas).

During the first 3 years, 987 participants (96.7%) underwent colonoscopic follow-up. The incidence of at least one colorectal adenoma was observed to be 44.1% with folic acid (n = 221) and 42.4% with placebo (n = 206) [unadjusted risk ratio (RR), 1.04; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.90–1.20; p = 0.58]. The incidence of at least one advanced lesion was 11.4% for folic acid (n = 57) and 8.6% for placebo.

### Folic acid supplementation, dietary folate intake during pregnancy and risk for spontaneous preterm delivery: a prospective observational cohort study [^113aL7AB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). High credibility.

In the past decade, some observational studies have found that folic acid supplementation reduces the risk of PTD. In some studies, this effect has been documented with an extended folic acid supplementation scheme or dosage compared with schemes based on NTD prevention, e.g. pre-conceptional folic acid supplementation for one year or longer or third-trimester folic acid supplementation. The most recent Cochrane review, based on data from 21 studies including one of the largest randomized controlled trials (RCT), as well as a recent meta-analysis of all RCTs published at the time of writing, could not confirm any effect of the maternal folate status on the gestational length or the risk of spontaneous PTD.

The comparability and generalizability of these earlier studies, which focused on the association of folate status and folic acid supplementation with pregnancy outcomes, is limited because folic acid supplementation was assessed without considering other folate sources. The study populations had different levels of dietary folate intake, inadequate sample sizes, limited adjustment for important confounders, and/or retrospective study designs with folate data collection only after delivery. Although PTD is a heterogeneous pregnancy outcome with different etiologies (early vs. late or iatrogenic vs. spontaneous), previous studies have mostly treated PTD as one entity, obscuring the differences in risk among PTD subtypes.

The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) can meet a number of these challenges in study design, a requirement for addressing the inconsistencies in the field.

### Vitamin requirements during stem cell transplantation: a systematic review [^116MLHYR]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Low credibility.

Two studies provided post-transplant folic acid supplementation (excluding studies using folinic acid). One study monitored serum folate levels, while the other assessed any associations with clinical outcomes. Both studies did not specify the number of patients receiving supplements or the duration of supplementation.

Robien et al. stratified the study cohort based on folic acid intake levels from a calculated daily average during Days 0–18 post-transplant. They determined the association of these levels with the development of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD), oral mucositis (OM), and overall mortality. A non-significant association was reported via multivariate analysis, regarding the risk of aGvHD, relapse, and survival for those consuming above and below the US recommended dietary intake of folic acid. No clear associations were found between average OM Index scores and higher folic acid intake.

Nannya et al. monitored vitamin levels and only reported on deficient individuals. Fifty percent of participants had deficient vitamin levels (< 3.1 ng/mL) at baseline and Day 0 (2.9 ng/mL). However, the prevalence of folate deficiency dropped to 21% by Day 14 when most patients began receiving parenteral nutrition (PN).

The certainty of evidence for aGvHD, OM, and overall mortality was rated as very low according to the GRADE assessment, due to very serious risk of bias and serious imprecision.

### Preconception folic acid supplementation for the prevention of birth defects: A prospective, population-based cohort study in mainland China [^113F3tno]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). High credibility.

- **Principle findings**: In the postfortification era, the benefits of preconceptional folic acid supplementation on reducing the odds of birth defects require comprehensive consideration before implementation. This study is one of the first prospective cohorts providing essential, real-world evidence that preconceptional folic acid supplementation of 0.4 mg/day is protective for reducing the odds of offspring's birth defects. With significant maternal health investment from the Chinese government, periconceptional folic acid intake has achieved high coverage among women with pregnancy intentions. Our findings are important for continuous efforts to promote this public health policy for reducing the risk of some birth defects, such as neural tube defects (NTDs) and clefts.

- **Results**: In this large programmatic evaluation of the periconception folic acid supplementation strategy, the comparative effectiveness on reducing the risk of birth defects was estimated in 574,071 married couples in mainland China. We found that wives who took folic acid before conception had lower odds of clefts and NTDs. Folic acid supplementation might substantially decrease the risk of some types of common birth defects, particularly with regular and full-term supplementation at least 3 months before conception and in the early 3 months of pregnancy.

- **Clinical implications**: Our findings support periconception folic acid supplementation as an essential component of preconception care and indicate that folic acid might be beneficial for reducing the odds of NTDs and cleft, in agreement with evidence from previous studies.

### Screening for reducing morbidity and mortality in malignant melanoma [^113Nwisw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Screening for malignant melanoma has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality from the disease through earlier detection, as prognosis is closely associated with the thickness of the lesion at the time of diagnosis. However, there are also potential harms from screening people without skin lesion concerns, such as overdiagnosis of lesions that would never have caused symptoms if they had remained undetected. Overdiagnosis results in harm through unnecessary treatment and the psychosocial consequences of being labelled with a cancer diagnosis. For any type of screening, the benefits must outweigh the harms. Screening for malignant melanoma is currently practised in many countries, and the incidence of the disease is rising sharply, while mortality remains largely unchanged.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects on morbidity and mortality of screening for malignant melanoma in the general population.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to May 2018: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registries, checked the reference lists of included and other relevant studies for further references to randomized controlled trials (RCTs), used citation tracking (Web of Science) for key articles, and asked trialists about additional studies and study reports.

- **Selection criteria**: RCTs, including cluster-randomised trials, of screening for malignant melanoma compared with no screening, regardless of screening modality or setting, in any type of population and in any age group.

### Folic acid [^115RPuGb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Folic acid in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, as hematologic remission can occur while neurologic manifestations remain progressive. There is a potential danger in administering folic acid to patients with undiagnosed anemia because it may obscure the diagnosis of pernicious anemia by alleviating the hematologic manifestations of the disease while allowing the neurologic complications to progress. This may result in severe nervous system damage before the correct diagnosis is made. Adequate doses of vitamin B12 may prevent, halt, or improve the neurologic changes caused by pernicious anemia.

- **Drug interactions**: There is evidence that the anticonvulsant action of phenytoin is antagonized by folic acid. A patient whose epilepsy is completely controlled by phenytoin may require increased doses to prevent convulsions if folic acid is given. Folate deficiency may result from increased loss of folate, as in renal dialysis and/or interference with metabolism (e.g. folic acid antagonists such as methotrexate); the administration of anticonvulsants such as diphenylhydantoin, primidone, and barbiturates; alcohol consumption and, especially, alcoholic cirrhosis; and the administration of pyrimethamine and nitrofurantoin. False low serum and red cell folate levels may occur if the patient has been taking antibiotics such as tetracycline, which suppress the growth of Lactobacillus casei.

### Folic acid supplementation and colorectal cancer risk: a meta-analysis [^1119HrjT]. Colorectal Disease (2011). Low credibility.

This meta-analysis aims to determine the effect of folic acid supplementation on colorectal cancer risk. A structured search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and CINAHL databases was undertaken in July 2008. All published full-text English language articles that included a randomized or pseudo-randomized comparison of subjects who received folate vs. subjects who did not, in relation to their risk of adenoma or advanced adenomatous lesions, including colorectal cancer, were searched. A weighted treatment effect (using fixed effects) was calculated across trials.

Overall, the risk of an adenomatous lesion was not increased (odds ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval 0.93–1.28) among patients who received folate supplementation for up to 3 years; however, for those who received folate for over 3 years, the risk of an adenomatous lesion was increased (odds ratio 1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.06–1.70). The risk associated with treatment was the highest for the occurrence of an advanced lesion (odds ratio 1.50, 95% confidence interval 1.06–2.10). There was no significant statistical heterogeneity in the analyses.

At the 3-year colonoscopic follow-up, folate supplementation had no effect on adenoma recurrence overall, while colonic surveillance beyond 3 years revealed an increased risk of colorectal adenoma, especially advanced adenoma, among those participants randomized to the folate group. This meta-analysis challenges the results from epidemiological studies that folate status is inversely related to the risk of developing colorectal cancer.

### Nutrition and melanoma prevention [^111MgeHi]. Clinics in dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

There has been considerable research in recent years on dietary factors and nutritional elements that might impact melanoma risk. A wide variety of dietary compounds have been studied, but only a selected group will be discussed in this review. Many compounds have promising in vitro evidence supporting their potential, and some have been associated with decreased melanoma risk in epidemiologic studies; however, data from randomized controlled trials in humans are lacking. Future studies may be able to clarify the potential role of dietary components in melanoma risk reduction.

### Folic acid supplementation and the risk of cardiovascular diseases: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111a6qn9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

In 1969, McCully postulated that homocysteine affected atherosclerotic processes. Since that time, prospective observations and genetic studies have suggested a causal role of blood homocysteine in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Observational studies indicated that for each 5‐μmol/L rise in serum homocysteine levels, there was a 32% increased risk of ischemic heart disease and a 59% increased risk of stroke.

The potential causal role of homocysteine in CVD was supported by Mendelian randomization studies using the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), an enzyme involved in homocysteine metabolism, as an instrumental variable. Compared to people who were homozygous for the wild‐type allele (CC) of MTHFR, those who were homozygous for the mutant allele (TT) had 1.93‐μmol/L or 25% higher homocysteine concentrations, a 26% higher risk of stroke, and a 16% higher risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).

Evidence from these studies provided the rationale for conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of folic acid supplementation and CVD prevention. This is because supplementation with folic acid is an inexpensive and effective method of lowering blood homocysteine concentrations. The introduction in 1998 of mandatory fortification of enriched cereal grain products with folic acid in North America, initially aimed at reducing the occurrence of neural tube birth defects, was associated with a significant reduction of the mean homocysteine concentration by approximately 7% in middle‐aged and older adults.

### Efficacy of folic acid supplementation in stroke prevention: a meta-analysis [^114CzUpm]. Lancet (2007). Low credibility.

The efficacy of treatments that lower homocysteine concentrations in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease remains controversial. Our aim was to conduct a meta-analysis of relevant randomized trials to assess the efficacy of folic acid supplementation in the prevention of stroke.

- **Methods**: We collected data from eight randomized trials of folic acid in which stroke was reported as an endpoint. Relative risk (RR) was used as a measure of the effect of folic acid supplementation on the risk of stroke with a random effect model. The analysis was further stratified by factors that could affect the treatment effects.

- **Findings**: Folic acid supplementation significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 18% (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68–1.00; p = 0.045). In the stratified analyses, a greater beneficial effect was seen in those trials with a treatment duration of more than 36 months (0.71, 0.57–0.87; p = 0.001), a decrease in the concentration of homocysteine of more than 20% (0.77, 0.63–0.94; p = 0.012), no fortification or partly fortified grain (0.75, 0.62–0.91; p = 0.003), and no history of stroke (0.75, 0.62–0.90; p = 0.002). In the corresponding comparison groups, the estimated RRs were attenuated and insignificant.

- **Interpretation**: Our findings indicate that folic acid supplementation can effectively reduce the risk of stroke in primary prevention.

### A randomized trial on folic acid supplementation and risk of recurrent colorectal adenoma [^112nmJgs]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Evidence from observational studies suggests that inadequate folate status enhances colorectal carcinogenesis, but results from some randomized trials do not support this hypothesis.

- **Objective**: To assess the effect of folic acid supplementation on colorectal adenoma, we conducted a cost-efficient, double-blind, randomized trial among participants of two large prospective cohorts: the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study and the Nurses' Health Study.

- **Design**: Participants were randomly assigned to receive folic acid (1 mg/d) (n = 338) or placebo (n = 334) for 3–6.5 years. The primary endpoint was any new diagnosis of adenoma during the study period (May 1996-March 2004). Secondary outcomes were adenoma by site and stage and number of adenomas. Associations were also examined by plasma folate concentrations at baseline.

- **Results**: Incidence of at least one adenoma was not significantly associated with folic acid supplementation (relative risk [RR]: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.59, 1.13; P = 0.22). Among participants with low plasma folate concentrations at baseline (7.5 ng/mL), supplemental folic acid had no significant effect (RR: 1.28; 95% CI: 0.82, 1.99; P = 0.27, P(interaction) = 0.01). Contrary to findings from another clinical trial, there was no evidence for an increased risk of advanced or multiple adenomas.

- **Conclusions**: Folic acid supplementation does not significantly affect the recurrence of colorectal adenomas in the studied population.

### Association of vitamin A and carotenoid intake with melanoma risk in a large prospective cohort [^115htB18]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Laboratory data suggest that intake of vitamin A and carotenoids may have chemopreventive benefits against melanoma, but epidemiological studies examining the association have yielded conflicting results. We examined whether dietary and supplemental vitamin A and carotenoid intake was associated with melanoma risk among 69,635 men and women who were participants of the VITamins And Lifestyle (VITAL) cohort study in western Washington. After an average of 5.84 years of follow-up, 566 incident melanomas were identified. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk of melanoma associated with dietary, supplemental, and total vitamin A and carotenoid intake after adjusting for melanoma risk factors.

Baseline use of individual retinol supplements was associated with a significant reduction in melanoma risk (HR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.41–0.89). High-dose (> 1,200 μg per day) supplemental retinol was also associated with reduced melanoma risk (HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.55–1.00), as compared with non-users. The reduction in melanoma risk was stronger in sun-exposed anatomic sites. There was no association of melanoma risk with dietary or total intake of vitamin A or carotenoids. Retinol supplementation may have a preventative role in melanoma among women.

### Folic acid supplementation to prevent neural tube defects: US Preventive Services Task Force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^1119t4Zd]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements, and more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, vitamin B9 and B12, the USPSTF 2023 guidelines recommend offering folic acid supplementation of 400–800 mcg/day to all individuals planning to or who could become pregnant to prevent fetal neural tube defects.

### Folate and retinal vascular diseases [^111WbpWN]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Low credibility.

Folate supplementation includes external forms such as folic acid, L-methylfolate, and folinic acid. Mandatory folic acid fortification of grain products has been implemented in certain countries, like Canada, successfully reducing neural tube defects by 20% to 50%. Folic acid supplementation is widely recognized for reducing the risk of neural tube defects and is commonly used to treat hyperhomocysteinemia and folate deficiency. Daily supplementation of 0.5 to 5.0 mg of folic acid can reduce plasma homocysteine levels by approximately a quarter to a third, particularly in western populations. However, the long-term consumption of folic acid is controversial. As diets improve and individuals voluntarily consume fortified foods and supplements, some people may ingest excess folate, exceeding the upper limit of 1 mg. In 2015, the World Health Organization defined high folate status as plasma folate levels greater than 45.3 nmol/L. An imbalance of high folate status and low vitamin B12 can predispose pregnant women to diabetes and their offspring to insulin resistance. High folic acid intake may also increase the risk of certain types of cancer, such as colorectal and prostate cancer. Numerous studies have examined the controversial effects of folic acid on cancer risk. Some studies conclude that folic acid supplementation does not influence overall or site-specific cancer incidence. This controversy may relate to folate status, cancer stage, varying baseline data, and more. Further research is needed to explore these effects comprehensively.

### Guideline: Optimal serum and red blood cell folate concentrations in women of reproductive age for prevention of neural tube defects [^111QkY3C]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2015). High credibility.

The World Health Organization's 2015 guidelines discuss preventative measures for myelomeningocele, particularly concerning periconceptional folic acid supplementation. These guidelines state that there is insufficient evidence to recommend an optimal serum folate threshold for the prevention of neural tube defects in females of reproductive age at the population level.

### Cancer incidence and mortality after treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 [^113qidmv]. JAMA (2009). Low credibility.

Recently, concern has been raised about the safety of folic acid, particularly in relation to cancer risk.

- **Objective**: To evaluate effects of treatment with B vitamins on cancer outcomes and all-cause mortality in 2 randomized controlled trials.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Combined analysis and extended follow-up of participants from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, the Norwegian Vitamin Trial and Western Norway B Vitamin Intervention Trial. A total of 6,837 patients with ischemic heart disease were treated with B vitamins or placebo between 1998 and 2005 and were followed up through December 31, 2007.

- **Interventions**: Oral treatment with folic acid (0.8 mg/d) plus vitamin B12 (0.4 mg/d) and vitamin B6 (40 mg/d) (n = 1,708); folic acid (0.8 mg/d) plus vitamin B12 (0.4 mg/d) (n = 1,703); vitamin B6 alone (40 mg/d) (n = 1,705); or placebo (n = 1,721).

- **Main outcome measures**: Cancer incidence, cancer mortality, and all-cause mortality.

- **Results**: During study treatment, median serum folate concentration increased more than 6-fold among participants given folic acid. After a median 39 months of treatment and an additional 38 months of post-trial observational follow-up, 341 participants (10.0%) who received folic acid plus vitamin B12 versus 288 participants (8.4%) who did not receive such treatment were diagnosed with cancer (hazard ratio [HR] 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.41; p = 0.02). A total of 136 (4.0%) who received folic acid plus vitamin B12 versus 100 (2.9%) who did not receive such treatment died from cancer.

### Folic acid supplementation, dietary folate intake during pregnancy and risk for spontaneous preterm delivery: A prospective observational cohort study [^115Tz4FK]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

In the past decade, some observational studies have found that folic acid supplementation reduces the risk of preterm delivery (PTD). In some studies, this effect has been documented with an extended folic acid supplementation scheme or dosage compared with schemes based on neural tube defect (NTD) prevention, such as preconceptional folic acid supplementation for one year or longer or third-trimester folic acid supplementation. A study based on the previous Cochrane review, data from one of the largest randomized controlled trials (RCT), a recent meta-analysis of all published RCTs, and the recent Cochrane review based on three controlled trials could not confirm any effect of maternal folate status on gestational length or the risk of spontaneous PTD.

The comparability and generalizability of these earlier studies, which focused on the association of folate status and folic acid supplementation with pregnancy outcome, is limited because folic acid supplementation was assessed without considering other folate sources. Additionally, study populations had different levels of dietary folate intake, inadequate sample sizes, limited adjustment for important confounders, and/or retrospective study designs with folate data collection only after delivery. Although PTD is a heterogeneous pregnancy outcome with different etiologies (early vs. late or iatrogenic vs. spontaneous), previous studies have mostly treated PTD as one entity, obscuring the differences in risk among PTD subtypes.

The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) can meet a number of these challenges in study design, a requirement for addressing.

### Pre- and postfortification intake of folate and risk of colorectal cancer in a large prospective cohort study in the United States [^117MJcX3]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

A higher folate intake is associated with a decreased colorectal cancer risk in observational studies, but recent evidence suggests that excessive folate supplementation may increase colorectal cancer risk in some individuals. Therefore, mandatory folic acid fortification of grain products in the United States may have unintended negative consequences.

- **Objective**: We examined the association between folate intake and colorectal cancer risk, including 8.5 years of postfortification follow-up.

- **Design**: We examined the association between folate intake and colorectal cancer in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, a US cohort study of 525,488 individuals aged 50–71 years initiated in 1995–1996. Dietary, supplemental, and total folate intakes were calculated for the pre- and postfortification periods (before and after July 1, 1997) based on a baseline food-frequency questionnaire. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models.

- **Results**: During follow-up through December 31, 2006 (mean follow-up: 9.1 years), 7,212 incident colorectal cancer cases were identified. In the postfortification analysis (6,484 cases), a higher total folate intake was associated with a decreased colorectal cancer risk (HR for ≥ 900 compared with < 200 μg/d: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.84). The highest intakes specifically from supplements (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.92) or from diet (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.97) were also protective. The pattern of associations was similar for the prefortification period, and no significant differences between time periods were observed.

### Melanoma chemoprevention [^114pyAG3]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Despite efforts to promote sun protection behaviors, melanoma incidence continues to rise. The prognosis of advanced melanoma remains extremely poor despite treatment advances, highlighting the importance of exploring additional preventive measures.

- **Objective**: We sought to summarize the results of published research on candidate chemoprevention agents for melanoma.

- **Methods**: We conducted a narrative review of the literature.

- **Results**: Investigation into a possible role in melanoma chemoprevention continues for multiple agents, including sunscreen, lipid-lowering medications, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dietary nutrients, immunomodulators, and other drugs, including retinoids, difluoromethylornithine, and T4 endonuclease V.

- **Limitations**: A systematic review of the literature was not performed.

- **Conclusion**: Because no agent yet emerges as a clear choice for effective melanoma chemoprevention, sun avoidance and sun protection remain the mainstay of melanoma prevention for persons at high risk.

### Meta-analysis of folic acid efficacy trials in stroke prevention: Insight into effect modifiers [^116X7zRg]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy and effect modifiers of folic acid supplementation in preventing strokes in regions without folic acid fortification. This was based on relevant, up-to-date published randomized trials.

- **Methods**: Relative risk (RR) was used to measure the effect of folic acid supplementation on the risk of stroke, utilizing a fixed effects model.

- **Findings**: Overall, folic acid supplementation significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 11% (22 trials, n = 82,723; RR 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84–0.96). The effect was more pronounced in low folate regions (2 trials, n = 24,020; Asia, 0.78, 0.67–0.90) compared to high folate regions (7 trials, n = 14,655; America, 1.05, 0.90–1.23), and among patients without folic acid fortification (11 trials, n = 49,957; 0.85; 0.77–0.94) compared to those with folic acid fortification (7 trials, n = 14,655; 1.05, 0.90–1.23). In further stratified analyses among trials without folic acid fortification, a larger beneficial effect was observed in trials with low dosage of folic acid (≤ 0.8 mg: 0.78, 0.69–0.88) or low baseline vitamin B12 levels (< 384 pg/mL: 0.78, 0.68–0.89). In the corresponding comparison groups, the effect sizes were attenuated and insignificant (p for interaction < 0.05 for both). Although the interaction tests were not significant, there might be a higher benefit in trials with a low dosage of vitamin B12, a low prevalence of statin use, but a high prevalence of hypertension.

- **Conclusions**: Folic acid supplementation could reduce stroke risk in regions without folic acid fortification, particularly in specific subgroups where low dosages and certain baseline conditions prevail.

### Vitamin D, vitamin A, the primary melanoma transcriptome and survival [^111M2VwF]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

The work we have done to explore whether there is a causal relationship between higher vitamin D levels and better melanoma survival started with an experiment known as Mendelian randomization. In this approach, inherited genetic variation, which moderates the factor under test, is sought, and an association with that gene and the outcome of interest is tested. If a relationship between inheritance of that genetic variation and the outcome is seen, then this is good evidence that the relationship is causal. In our experiment, we looked at the inheritance of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) coding for the vitamin D binding hormone, which had been identified in genome-wide association studies as the SNP with the strongest association with vitamin D levels and has been shown in our data to be so. People with this variant have lower serum levels of vitamin D. If vitamin D were important for melanoma survival, then we would expect people inheriting this SNP would have a worse prognosis. We worked with colleagues from a melanoma research consortium called BioGenoMEL to carry out a meta-analysis of data from multiple studies and showed supportive evidence for this hypothesis, although not quite conclusive. In fact, only 4% of the variance in vitamin D levels in the cohort was 'explained' by this genetic variation, so despite recruiting several thousand patients, our study was inadequately powered to show a clear result. This is a common problem with Mendelian randomization.

### Nutrition and melanoma prevention [^116wpMsg]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Melanoma has continued to rise in incidence despite public efforts to promote sun protection behaviors. Because sunscreen use does not completely prevent skin cancer induced by ultraviolet radiation, additional chemopreventive methods for protecting against and reversing the effects of ultraviolet photodamage need evaluation. Recent years have brought increased interest in dietary factors, such as natural botanicals and vitamins, for the prevention of melanoma.

This contribution provides a narrative review of the relevant, nutrition-related literature found by searching the keywords "melanoma chemoprevention", "nutrition and melanoma", "dietary botanicals and melanoma prevention", "green tea and melanoma", "vitamin D and melanoma", and "vitamin E and melanoma" in the PubMed database. Although randomized controlled trials of humans are lacking, basic science and epidemiologic studies show promising benefits of many natural products in chemoprevention for melanoma. Future studies, hopefully, will yield concrete answers and clarify the role of commonly available dietary nutrients in melanoma chemoprevention.

Regarding patient education for cutaneous melanoma, specifically related to genetic counseling, the AAD 2019 guidelines recommend providing cancer risk counseling by a qualified genetic counselor for patients with CM who meet any of the following criteria:

- **A family history of invasive CM or pancreatic cancer**: There should be three or more affected members on one side of the family.

- **Multiple primary invasive CM (three or more)**: This includes at least one early-onset tumor diagnosed before the age of 45 years.

- **At least one melanocytic BAP1-mutated atypical intradermal tumor**: Accompanied by a family history of mesothelioma, meningioma, and/or uveal melanoma.

- **Two or more melanocytic BAP1-mutated atypical intradermal tumors**.

### Nutrition and nonmelanoma skin cancers [^113YwdPw]. Clinics in Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), the most widely diagnosed cancer in the United States, is rising in incidence despite public health and educational campaigns that highlight the importance of sun avoidance. It is, therefore, important to establish other modifiable risk factors that may be contributing to this increase. There is a growing body of evidence in the literature suggesting certain nutrients may have protective or harmful effects on NMSC. We review the literature on nutrition and its effect on NMSC with a focus on dietary fat, vitamin A, nicotinamide, folate, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, polyphenols, and selenium.

### Risk of melanoma recurrence after diagnosis of a high-risk primary tumor [^111meiFh]. JAMA Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

With emerging new systemic treatments for metastatic melanoma, early detection of disease recurrence is increasingly important. The objective of this study was to investigate the risk of melanoma recurrence in patients with a localized melanoma at a high risk of metastasis.

A total of 1,254 patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed tumor category T1b to T4b melanoma in Queensland, Australia, were recruited prospectively between October 1, 2010, and October 1, 2014, for participation in a cohort study. Data analysis was conducted from February 8, 2018, to February 20, 2019. We used Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to examine associations between patient and tumor factors and melanoma recurrence.

- **Exposures**: Disease-free survival (DFS) by melanoma tumor category defined by the 7th vs. 8th editions of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual (AJCC 7 vs AJCC 8).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Melanoma recurrences were self-reported through follow-up questionnaires administered every 6 months and confirmed by histologic or imaging findings.

Of 1,254 patients recruited, 825 individuals (65.8%) agreed to participate. Thirty-six were found to be ineligible after providing consent, and a further 89 patients were excluded after reclassifying tumors using AJCC 8, leaving 700 participants with high-risk primary melanoma (mean [SD] age, 62.2 [13.5] years; 410 [58.6%] men). Independent predictors of recurrence were the head or neck site of the primary tumor, ulceration, thickness, and mitotic rate greater than 3/mm² (hazard ratio, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.1).

### Effects and safety of preventive oral iron or iron+folic acid supplementation for women during pregnancy [^117WskR1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). High credibility.

Intake of supplements containing iron or a combination of iron and folic acid by pregnant women may improve maternal health and pregnancy outcomes. Recently, intermittent supplementation regimens have been proposed as alternatives to daily regimens.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of daily and intermittent use of iron or iron+folic acid supplements by pregnant women.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (March 2009) and contacted relevant organizations for the identification of ongoing and unpublished studies.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized or quasi-randomized trials evaluating the effect of supplementation with iron or iron+folic acid during pregnancy were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We assessed the methodological quality of trials using the standard Cochrane criteria. Two authors independently assessed which trials to include in the review, and one author extracted data.

- **Main results**: We included 49 trials involving 23,200 pregnant women. Overall, the results showed significant heterogeneity across most prespecified outcomes and were analyzed assuming random-effects. The trials provided limited information related to clinical maternal and infant outcomes. Overall, daily iron supplementation was associated with increased hemoglobin levels in maternal blood both before and after birth and reduced risk of anemia at term. These effects did not differ significantly between women receiving intermittent or daily iron or iron+folic acid supplementation.

### Folic acid supplementation, dietary folate intake during pregnancy and risk for spontaneous preterm delivery: a prospective observational cohort study [^111RPZ1u]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

In this large prospective national birth cohort study, we did not find any statistically significant association between the amount of folate intake from the diet or supplements and spontaneous preterm delivery (PTD) in uncomplicated pregnancies. Folic acid supplementation starting more than 8 weeks before conception was associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) for spontaneous PTD.

When interpreting the results, the selection of the study population has to be considered: all known risk-pregnancies due to maternal disease, pregnancy complications, or fetal malformation were excluded from the analysis. There might be an association between the amount of folate intake from diet or supplements and spontaneous PTD in those pregnancies that were excluded.

Our results, demonstrating no significant protective effect of maternal folate intake or folic acid supplementation on the spontaneous PTD risk, support a number of earlier observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A reanalysis of the most recent Cochrane review, based on data from 21 studies and one of the largest RCTs, as well as a recent meta-analysis of all RCTs published at the time of writing, could not confirm the effect of maternal folate status on gestational length or risk of PTD. Shaw et al. found a comparable association of increased PTD risk and pre-conceptional folic acid supplementation when analyzing data from the US National Birth Defects Study. Additionally, extensive supplementation with multivitamins with a major folic acid component was associated with an increased risk of PTD in a study by Alwan et al.

### Antagonistic effects of aspirin and folic acid on inflammation markers and subsequent risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas [^115aSyc5]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2009). Low credibility.

The Aspirin/Folate Polyp Prevention Trial found that aspirin, but not folic acid, reduced the recurrence of colorectal adenomas. This study examined whether treatment effects on inflammation markers explained the trial results. The trial had a factorial design with three aspirin groups (placebo, 81 mg/d, and 325 mg/d) and two folic acid groups (placebo and 1 mg/d). There were 884 subjects who underwent colonoscopic evaluation for adenomas at year 3. Plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), soluble TNF receptor type II (sTNF-R2), and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) were measured at baseline and year 3.

Among individuals not receiving folic acid, there was a 4% decrease (mean ratio of year 3 to baseline levels = 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.82 to 1.14) in CRP over 3 years in the 325 mg aspirin group versus a 20% increase (mean ratio = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.41) in the placebo group (P = .027). By contrast, the reverse was observed among individuals who also received folic acid (P(interaction) = .013). Changes in inflammation markers were not associated with adenoma recurrence. Low-dose aspirin (325 mg/d) is beneficial in stabilizing CRP levels, which may be abrogated by folate. Nevertheless, inflammation markers do not mediate the chemopreventive effect of aspirin on colorectal adenomas.

### Cutaneous melanoma: ESMO clinical practice guideline for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^115mSC2e]. Annals of Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of cutaneous melanoma, particularly in managing locoregional disease such as in-transit metastases, the ESMO 2025 guidelines recommend offering systemic therapy. This includes anti-PD-1-based immunotherapy or a BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination, contingent on the BRAF mutation status in patients with unresectable satellite or in-transit metastases.

- **Local therapy options**: Consider talimogene laherparepvec, isolated limb infusion or isolated limb perfusion, radiotherapy, electrochemotherapy, or limited palliative excision. It is important to acknowledge that these modalities do not impact overall survival.

### Guideline: Optimal serum and red blood cell folate concentrations in women of reproductive age for prevention of neural tube defects [^113dxFX9]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2015). High credibility.

Regarding preventive measures for myelomeningocele, specifically in relation to periconceptional folic acid supplementation, WHO 2015 guidelines recommend aiming for red blood cell folate concentrations greater than 400 ng/mL (906 nmol/L) in females of reproductive age to achieve the greatest reduction of neural tube defects at the population level. Consider using this threshold as an indicator of folate insufficiency in this demographic. This threshold should be used only at the population level, as it cannot predict the individual risk of having a pregnancy affected by neural tube defects. Low folate concentrations do not explain all cases of neural tube defects.

### Systemic therapy for melanoma: ASCO guideline update [^1177tdPX]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of cutaneous melanoma, specifically in advanced/metastatic disease and first-line therapy, the ASCO 2023 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against adjuvant BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy in patients with resected stage IV melanoma with BRAF mutations other than V600E/K.
