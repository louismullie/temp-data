## Question

How much lasix drip to increase in a patient who is not putting out urine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much to increase a furosemide (Lasix) drip in a patient who is not putting out urine, including when to escalate, how much to increase, and what safety checks and alternatives to consider. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the patient is truly oliguric versus anuric and whether there is absolute contraindication to diuretics. Then, I should verify the current furosemide regimen and the patient's volume status and hemodynamics. Next, I will review guideline-based dosing principles for IV furosemide, including bolus versus infusion strategies and titration increments. After that, I need to check for diuretic resistance and consider adjuncts. Finally, I should confirm monitoring, safety thresholds, and when to pivot to renal replacement therapy if diuretics fail, aligning with ACC/AHA and KDIGO guidance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and definitions, because I need to ensure we are not dealing with anuria where loop diuretics are contraindicated. Oliguria is typically less than 0.5 mL/kg/h, whereas anuria is essentially no urine output; furosemide is contraindicated in anuria, so if there is true anuria, I should not escalate diuretics and should instead consider urgent nephrology consultation and renal replacement therapy rather than dose escalation [^113RFydL] [^1143UZ8K].

> Wait, let me verify the current furosemide regimen and the patient's baseline diuretic exposure, since this drives the next incremental dose. If the patient was on oral loop diuretics at home, the ACC/AHA recommends converting to IV furosemide at 1 to 2.5 times the total daily oral dose; if not previously on loop diuretics, a typical starting IV dose is 40 to 80 mg, often given as a bolus or as a continuous infusion, with subsequent adjustments based on response and congestion goals [^111MGtVU] [^114DeRrU].

> I need to check the patient's volume status and hemodynamics before I escalate diuretics, because giving more diuretic in the face of hypovolemia or poor renal perfusion can worsen kidney function. Let me consider whether the patient is euvolemic, hypervolemic, or hypovolemic, and whether blood pressure and cardiac output are adequate; if there is hypovolemia, I should correct that first, and if there is cardiogenic shock or persistent hypotension, I should prioritize vasopressors and inotropes to secure perfusion before pushing diuretics [^1115dSjo].

> Next, I should review the initial IV dosing and titration cadence. For IV bolus, a common start is 20 to 40 mg over 1 to 2 minutes, repeating at the same dose or increasing by 20 mg no sooner than 2 hours later; for continuous infusion, a reasonable starting point is 5 to 10 mg/h, titrating by 5 to 10 mg/h every few hours based on urine output and congestion, with a typical ceiling around 20 to 40 mg/h in severe cases, while watching for ototoxicity and electrolyte shifts [^113rUzzd] [^116FNPCM] [^114Ntnmp].

> Hold on, I should verify the escalation strategy when urine output remains inadequate. If diuresis is insufficient, I can double the bolus dose or the infusion rate in a stepwise fashion, for example from 10 to 20 mg/h, then to 40 mg/h if needed, while ensuring at least several hours between changes to judge response; in heart failure, the ACC/AHA supports increasing loop diuretic dose by 50% to 100% until effective decongestion or until approximately 400 to 500 mg/day of furosemide equivalent is reached, beyond which additional benefit is unlikely and risks rise [^111MGtVU] [^113Z49sd].

> I will now examine diuretic responsiveness and resistance, because if the patient is resistant, simply increasing the dose may not help. Spot urine sodium measured about 2 hours after a dose can help; a value less than 50 mEq/L suggests poor natriuretic response and diuretic resistance, prompting consideration of adjuncts such as a thiazide-type diuretic, acetazolamide, or cautious albumin in selected hypoalbuminemic states, while I continue to reassess volume, blood pressure, and kidney function [^113Z49sd] [^111MGtVU].

> But wait, what if the oliguria reflects established AKI rather than pure congestion. I should confirm that diuretics are being used for volume overload management and not to treat AKI per se, because KDIGO advises against using diuretics to enhance kidney recovery or reduce RRT; in oliguric AKI with fluid overload, diuretics may help control fluids, but they do not improve renal outcomes, so I must avoid over-reliance on escalating doses if the clinical goal is not being met [^113RFydL] [^117U7GYm].

> I need to ensure safety monitoring is in place before and after each dose change. That means checking serum electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN frequently, watching for hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and metabolic alkalosis, and monitoring for hypotension or ototoxicity; if doses exceed 80 mg/day for prolonged periods, closer observation is warranted, and if high-dose parenteral therapy is used, controlled infusion not exceeding about 4 mg/min is advisable to mitigate ototoxic risk [^114Ntnmp] [^114Ekz9C].

> Let me reconsider the ceiling and when to stop escalation. If the patient reaches approximately 400 to 500 mg/day of furosemide equivalent with minimal diuretic response and persistent oliguria, further increases are unlikely to help and may increase harm; at that point, I should pivot to nephrology consultation and consider initiation of renal replacement therapy for volume management rather than continuing to escalate diuretics [^113Z49sd] [^1115dSjo].

> Finally, I should double-check that my plan aligns with the clinical context. In acute decompensated heart failure, early IV loop diuretics with dose escalation toward decongestion is standard, whereas in anuria or severe intrinsic renal failure, diuretics are ineffective and contraindicated; in those cases, timely RRT is the appropriate path rather than futile diuretic escalation [^111MGtVU] [^113RFydL] [^1115dSjo].

When a patient is not producing urine, **do not increase the Lasix drip** [^1115dSjo]. Instead, **stop the drip immediately** and reassess for causes of anuria or severe oliguria, as furosemide is contraindicated in anuria and will not help if there is no kidney function or if there is obstruction [^113RFydL]. Escalating the dose risks **ototoxicity** [^114Ntnmp], **electrolyte disturbances** [^112rGfc5], and delayed definitive therapy. The priority is to **identify and treat the underlying cause** — such as hypovolemia, obstruction, or intrinsic renal failure — and to initiate renal replacement therapy if indicated [^111tzhKu].

---

## Clinical indications for furosemide use

Furosemide is indicated for **management of edema** associated with congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease [^117VZuAp]. It is also used to treat **acute pulmonary edema** and hypertensive emergencies. However, its use is **contraindicated in anuria** [^113RFydL], as the drug requires functional nephrons to exert its diuretic effect.

---

## Pharmacological mechanism of action

Furosemide inhibits the **Na-K-2Cl cotransporter** in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, thereby increasing sodium, chloride, and water excretion. This mechanism requires intact renal blood flow and tubular function; in the absence of urine production, furosemide cannot induce diuresis [^116rQbaU].

---

## Risks associated with increasing furosemide drip in anuric patients

Increasing the dose of furosemide in patients who are not producing urine can lead to **significant adverse effects**, including:

- **Ototoxicity**: High doses of furosemide, especially when administered rapidly, can cause irreversible hearing loss [^114Ntnmp].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and metabolic alkalosis are common complications of excessive diuretic use [^112rGfc5].

- **Hypotension**: Excessive diuresis can cause volume depletion and circulatory collapse, particularly in critically ill patients [^112rGfc5].

- **Delayed definitive therapy**: Persisting with diuretics in anuric patients delays necessary interventions such as renal replacement therapy or surgical intervention for obstruction.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize that **diuretics should not be used to treat acute kidney injury (AKI) or anuria** except in the management of volume overload [^1115dSjo]. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines explicitly state that diuretics should not be used to enhance kidney function recovery or reduce the duration or frequency of renal replacement therapy (RRT) [^113bQuug]. The American College of Cardiology (ACC) also emphasizes that diuretics should be used cautiously and individualized based on patient response, with careful monitoring of renal function and electrolytes [^111MGtVU].

---

## Alternative clinical actions

When a patient is not producing urine, **the following steps should be taken**:

- **Immediate assessment**: Evaluate for prerenal (hypovolemia, hypotension), intrinsic (acute tubular necrosis, glomerulonephritis), and postrenal (obstruction) causes of anuria.

- **Hemodynamic stabilization**: Ensure adequate blood pressure and cardiac output to support renal perfusion [^111tzhKu].

- **Obstruction management**: If obstruction is suspected, immediate imaging (ultrasound) and surgical or urological intervention may be required.

- **Renal replacement therapy (RRT)**: If AKI is confirmed and the patient is volume overloaded or uremic, initiate dialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) [^notfound].

- **Discontinuation of furosemide**: Stop furosemide immediately if there is no urine output, as further administration is futile and harmful [^113RFydL].

---

## Clinical scenarios where increasing furosemide dose may be considered

There are limited scenarios where increasing the furosemide dose may be considered, such as **diuretic resistance**, in which a patient has documented urine output but inadequate diuresis, and after confirming that renal function is intact and that there is no obstruction. In such cases, careful dose escalation with close monitoring may be justified [^113Z49sd]. Additionally, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who retain some residual renal function, higher doses of furosemide may be required, but this should still be guided by clinical response and renal function monitoring [^114ytgxe].

---

## Monitoring parameters

If furosemide is administered (even in non-anuric patients), **close monitoring of the following parameters is essential**:

- **Urine output**: Hourly monitoring of urine production.

- **Electrolytes**: Frequent assessment of serum potassium, sodium, and bicarbonate levels [^116y5yPg].

- **Renal function**: Regular monitoring of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) [^116y5yPg].

- **Hemodynamic stability**: Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate [^notfound].

---

Increasing the dose of furosemide in a patient who is not producing urine is **contraindicated and potentially harmful**. The appropriate clinical action is to **immediately stop the furosemide drip**, assess and treat the underlying cause of anuria, and initiate renal replacement therapy if indicated.

WARNING

LASIX (furosemide) is a potent diuretic which, if given in excessive amounts, can lead to a profound diuresis with water and electrolyte depletion. Therefore, careful medical supervision is required and dose and dose schedule must be adjusted to the individual patient's needs (s ee DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Edema

Therapy should be individualized according to patient response to gain maximal therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose needed to maintain that response.

Adults — The usual initial dose of LASIX is 20 mg to 80mg given as a single dose. Ordinarily a prompt diuresis ensues. If needed, the same dose can be administered 6 to 8 hours later or the dose may be increased. The dose may be raised by 20 mg or 40mg and given not sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose until the desired diuretic effect has been obtained. The individually determined single dose should then be given once or twice daily (e.g., at 8 am and 2 pm). The dose of LASIX may be carefully titrated up to 600 mg/day in patients with clinically severe edematous states.

Edema may be most efficiently and safely mobilized by giving LASIX on 2 to 4 consecutive days each week.

When doses exceeding 80 mg/day are given for prolonged periods, careful clinical observation and laboratory monitoring are particularly advisable (s ee PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Test).

Geriatric patients — In general, dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

Pediatric patients — The usual initial dose of oral LASIX in pediatric patients is 2 mg/kg body weight, given as a single dose. If the diuretic response is not satisfactory after the initial dose, dosage may be increased by 1 or 2 mg/kg no sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose. Doses greater than 6 mg/kg body weight are not recommended. For maintenance therapy in pediatric patients, the dose should be adjusted to the minimum effective level.

WARNINGS

In patients with hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, LASIX therapy is best initiated in the hospital. In hepatic coma and in states of electrolyte depletion, therapy should not be instituted until the basic condition is improved. Sudden alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance in patients with cirrhosis may precipitate hepatic coma; therefore, strict observation is necessary during the period of diuresis. Supplemental potassium chloride and, if required, an aldosterone antagonist are helpful in preventing hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.

If increasing azotemia and oliguria occur during treatment of severe progressive renal disease, LASIX should be discontinued.

Cases of tinnitus and reversible or irreversible hearing impairment and deafness have been reported. Reports usually indicate that LASIX ototoxicity is associated with rapid injection, severe renal impairment, the use of higher than recommended doses, hypoproteinemia or concomitant therapy with aminoglycoside antibiotics, ethacrynic acid, or other ototoxic drugs. If the physician elects to use high dose parenteral therapy, controlled intravenous infusion is advisable (for adults, an infusion rate not exceeding 4mg LASIX per minute has been used) (s ee PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).

General

Excessive diuresis may cause dehydration and blood volume reduction with circulatory collapse and possibly vascular thrombosis and embolism, particularly in elderly patients. As with any effective diuretic, electrolyte depletion may occur during LASIX therapy, especially in patients receiving higher doses and a restricted salt intake. Hypokalemia may develop with LASIX, especially with brisk diuresis, inadequate oral electrolyte intake, when cirrhosis is present, or during concomitant use of corticosteroids, ACTH, licorice in large amounts, or prolonged use of laxatives. Digitalis therapy may exaggerate metabolic effects of hypokalemia, especially myocardial effects.

All patients receiving LASIX therapy should be observed for these signs or symptoms of fluid or electrolyte imbalance (hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia or hypocalcemia): dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, arrhythmia, or gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. Increases in blood glucose and alterations in glucose tolerance tests (with abnormalities of the fasting and 2-hour postprandial sugar) have been observed, and rarely, precipitation of diabetes mellitus has been reported.

In patients with severe symptoms of urinary retention (because of bladder emptying disorders, prostatic hyperplasia, urethral narrowing), the administration of furosemide can cause acute urinary retention related to increased production and retention of urine. Thus, these patients require careful monitoring, especially during the initial stages of treatment.

In patients at high risk for radiocontrast nephropathy, LASIX can lead to a higher incidence of deterioration in renal function after receiving radiocontrast compared to high-risk patients who received only intravenous hydration prior to receiving radiocontrast.

In patients with hypoproteinemia (e.g., associated with nephrotic syndrome), the effect of LASIX may be weakened and its ototoxicity potentiated.

Asymptomatic hyperuricemia can occur and gout may rarely be precipitated.

Patients allergic to sulfonamides may also be allergic to LASIX. The possibility exists of exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus.

As with many other drugs, patients should be observed regularly for the possible occurrence of blood dyscrasias, liver or kidney damage, or other idiosyncratic reactions.

Hypertension

Therapy should be individualized according to the patient's response to gain maximal therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose needed to maintain the therapeutic response.

Adults — The usual initial dose of LASIX for hypertension is 80mg, usually divided into 40mg twice a day. Dosage should then be adjusted according to response. If response is not satisfactory, add other antihypertensive agents.

Changes in blood pressure must be carefully monitored when LASIX is used with other antihypertensive drugs, especially during initial therapy. To prevent excessive drop in blood pressure, the dosage of other agents should be reduced by at least 50% when LASIX is added to the regimen. As the blood pressure falls under the potentiating effect of LASIX, a further reduction in dosage or even discontinuation of other antihypertensive drugs may be necessary.

Geriatric patients — In general, dose selection and dose adjustment for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

### Oliguria, volume overload, and loop diuretics [^1156wgVq]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is commonly and increasingly encountered in patients with critical illness. In the past, epidemiologic studies have consistently found that oliguria further increases the risk of death from AKI. Compared with patients outside the intensive care unit (ICU), critically ill patients are more likely to have volume overload as a result of impaired solute and water excretion. Recently, broad changes have occurred in ICU practice, such as early goal-directed therapy in sepsis, which may further compound volume overload in the ICU patient with oliguric AKI. Evidence has also emerged to suggest that a positive fluid accumulation in ICU patients can unfavorably affect outcome. Thus, the ICU patient with oliguric AKI presents a dilemma with limited therapeutic options. These would include optimization of systemic hemodynamics, added fluid therapy, administration of loop diuretics, or finally, the initiation of renal replacement therapy. Interestingly, recent survey data and observational studies indicate that a majority of intensivists use loop diuretics, specifically furosemide, at some point during the course of illness in patients with AKI. Paradoxically, loop diuretics have been found in several clinical studies of patients with AKI to be potentially detrimental or, at the least, lack effectiveness for improving clinical outcomes. This contradiction between clinical practice and available evidence would suggest there is equipoise and need for higher-quality evidence to better characterize the role of loop diuretics in ICU patients with AKI.

Information for Patients

Patients receiving LASIX should be advised that they may experience symptoms from excessive fluid and/or electrolyte losses. The postural hypotension that sometimes occurs can usually be managed by getting up slowly. Potassium supplements and/or dietary measures may be needed to control or avoid hypokalemia.

Patients with diabetes mellitus should be told that furosemide may increase blood glucose levels and thereby affect urine glucose tests. The skin of some patients may be more sensitive to the effects of sunlight while taking furosemide.

Hypertensive patients should avoid medications that may increase blood pressure, including over-the-counter products for appetite suppression and cold symptoms.

Laboratory Tests

Serum electrolytes (particularly potassium), CO2, creatinine and BUN should be determined frequently during the first few months of LASIX therapy and periodically thereafter. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting profusely or receiving parenteral fluids. Abnormalities should be corrected or the drug temporarily withdrawn. Other medications may also influence serum electrolytes.

Reversible elevations of BUN may occur and are associated with dehydration, which should be avoided, particularly in patients with renal insufficiency.

Urine and blood glucose should be checked periodically in diabetics receiving LASIX, even in those suspected of latent diabetes.

LASIX may lower serum levels of calcium (rarely cases of tetany have been reported) and magnesium. Accordingly, serum levels of these electrolytes should be determined periodically.

In premature infants LASIX may precipitate nephrocalcinosis/nephrolithiasis, therefore renal function must be monitored and renal ultrasonography performed (s ee PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use).

### Fluid balance and urine volume are independent predictors of mortality in acute kidney injury [^115Myyw4]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

The association between oliguria and worse outcomes in AKI patients is well recognized. In our study, the survival of non-oliguric patients was significantly better when compared to oliguric patients (Figure 3), but in both groups non-survivors had significantly higher MFB (Figure 1). Similarly to other authors, we did not find significant differences in mortality between patients who developed early or late AKI (not shown, P = 0.16 on log rank test) but again, non-survivors in both groups presented significantly higher MFB and lower MUV.

An interesting finding in the present study is that the use of diuretics was inversely associated with mortality, and this effect persisted after adjustment for MFB and MUV (adjusted HR 0.25, 95%CI 0.12 to 0.52), suggesting that the diuretic in itself may exert a protective effect. This differs from the FACTT study, in which post-AKI furosemide use had a protective effect on 60-day mortality on univariate analysis, but not when adjusted for fluid balance. The role of diuretics in AKI remains controversial. While three meta-analyses have demonstrated a lack of association between diuretics and mortality, only two of the included studies enrolled ICU patients. Two observational studies in ICU settings showed conflicting results. The PICARD Study Group concluded that diuretic use increased the risk of death or non-recovery of renal function (OR 1.77, 95%CI 1.14 to 2.76). In contrast, the Beginning and Ending Supportive Therapy for the Kidney (BEST Kidney) investigators did not find a significant association between diuretic use and mortality (adjusted OR 1.21, 95%CI 0.96 to 1.5). Loop diuretics have effects that could be potentially beneficial in preventing or minimizing the severity of AKI. They reduce the oxygen demand and prevent hypoxic damage, and furosemide has been shown to improve renal hemodynamics, attenuate ischemic-related renal angiogenesis and reduce ischemic-induced apoptosis in animal models. A pilot phase II randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial comparing furosemide to placebo in ICU patients with early AKI is in progress; this study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of furosemide versus placebo on the progression of AKI severity and fluid balance. The results of this trial will help us to understand better the role of diuretics in AKI in the critical care setting.

### Impact of loop diuretics on critically ill patients with a positive fluid balance [^115x5zXw]. Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

The impact of the use of loop diuretics to prevent cumulative fluid balance in non-oliguric patients is uncertain. This is a retrospective study to estimate the association of time-averaging loop diuretic exposure in a large population of non-cardiac, critically ill patients with a positive fluid balance (> 5% of body weight). The exposure was loop diuretic and the main outcomes were 28-day mortality, severe acute kidney injury and successful mechanical ventilation weaning. Time-fixed and daily time-varying variables were evaluated with a marginal structural Cox model, adjusting bias for time-varying exposure and the presence of time-dependent confounders. A total of 14,896 patients were included. Patients receiving loop diuretics had better survival (unadjusted hazard ratio 0.56, 95%CI 0.39–0.81 and baseline variables adjusted hazard ratio 0.53, 95%CI 0.45–0.62); after full adjusting, loop diuretics had no association with 28-day mortality (full adjusted hazard ratio 1.07, 95%CI 0.74–1.54) or with reducing severe acute kidney injury occurrence during intensive care unit stay - hazard ratio 1.05 (95%CI 0.78–1.42). However, we identified an association with prolonged mechanical ventilation (hazard ratio 1.59, 95%CI 1.35–1.89). The main results were consistent in the sub-group analysis for sepsis, oliguria and the study period (2002–2007 vs. 2008–2012). Also, equivalent doses of up to 80 mg per day of furosemide had no significant association with mortality. After adjusting for time-varying variables, the time average of loop diuretic exposure in non-cardiac, critically ill patients has no association with overall mortality or severe acute kidney injury; however, prolonged mechanical ventilation is a concern.

Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale

Since fluid retention is one of the major symptoms of impaired kidney function, diuretics are often used for patients with or developing AKI. Mostly, loop diuretics such as furosemide are administered to patients with AKI to convert oliguric to non-oliguric AKI, and to facilitate fluid management. However, some reports have indicated that the use of diuretics is associated with harmful effects maybe because circulating volume is reduced excessively, thereby worsening renal haemodynamics. The use of diuretics can also delay the recognition of AKI and nephrology consultation. In meta-analyses, the use of furosemide was not associated with any significant clinical benefits in the prevention and treatment of AKI in adults, and high doses were associated with an increased risk of ototoxicity. The ERBP work group therefore endorses both recommendations on the use of diuretics in patients with AKI.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Edema

Therapy should be individualized according to patient response to gain maximal therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose needed to maintain that response.

Adults — The usual initial dose of furosemide is 20 mg to 80 mg given as a single dose. Ordinarily a prompt diuresis ensues. If needed, the same dose can be administered 6 to 8 hours later or the dose may be increased. The dose may be raised by 20 mg or 40 mg and given not sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose until the desired diuretic effect has been obtained. The individually determined single dose should then be given once or twice daily (e.g., at 8 am and 2 pm). The dose of furosemide may be carefully titrated up to 600 mg/day in patients with clinically severe edematous states.

Edema may be most efficiently and safely mobilized by giving furosemide on 2 to 4 consecutive days each week.

When doses exceeding 80 mg/day are given for prolonged periods, careful clinical observation and laboratory monitoring are particularly advisable (see PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Test).

Geriatric patients — In general, dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

Acute kidney injury (AKI) definition — urine output criteria: Both RIFLE and AKIN included duration of oliguria in their definitions and staging criteria, but studies found poor calibration between urine output criteria and serum creatinine criteria and poor prognostic correlation between briefer durations of oliguria and small changes in serum creatinine level. Oliguria may reflect under-resuscitation rather than kidney injury, and the weight-based urine output definition limits use in obesity, such that under the current definition, urine output of 40 mL/h in a 90-kg patient for 12 hours would lead to classification as stage 2 AKI. Diuretic administration has been shown to change RIFLE classification by urine output criteria, and pharmacologic agents such as loop diuretics or dopamine may not be helpful and may even be harmful in some settings. While inclusion of urine output criteria may encourage documentation of urine output and overall fluid balance, there are risks of unintended consequences with defining transient oliguria as AKI, and the authors state that current data are inadequate to support reliance on oliguria as a surrogate end point in clinical trials or in performance metrics. In pediatrics, reliance on urine output and weight-based fluid balance makes inclusion reasonable; nonetheless, further research is needed and practitioners should recognize that many of the same limitations to the use of urine output criteria apply in the pediatric population.

Dogma #1: Give fluids, diuretics, and vasopressors if urinary output decreases

Most oliguric intensive care unit (ICU) patients receive fluids, diuretics, and/or vasopressors with the goal to prevent acute kidney injury (AKI). This treatment, however, is based on the belief that AKI in critically ill patients results from renal ischaemia. Whereas fluids and vasopressors are usually administered to increase renal blood flow and in proportion oxygen delivery, diuretics are given to reduce the osmolarity in the renal medulla. This is expected to increase glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and ultimately improve renal function.

Oliguria, however, is a clinical symptom rather than a disease. The underlying mechanisms include, but are not restricted to, hypovolaemia, physiologic stress response, tubular damage, post-renal obstruction or a combination of these factors. If hypovolaemia is not the cause of oliguria, it does not make sense to administer fluids for its treatment. Giving fluids to patients who are not hypovolaemic may in fact harm the kidneys by increasing intracapsular pressure, thereby further reducing urinary output. Hence, administering fluids to these patients may lead into a vicious cycle of infusing more and more fluids to treat oliguria, which is eventually a result of over-hydration. Furthermore, if functional renal damage is present, e.g. due to ischaemia or nephrotoxins, treating oliguria with fluids or diuretics is unlikely to improve renal function. In this context, it is also noteworthy that the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines for AKI recommend neither fluid therapy beyond the correction of hypovolaemia nor diuretics for the treatment of AKI. This is supported by the fact that clinical evidence for a sustained increase in urine output or improvement in renal blood flow secondary to fluids and/or diuretics is lacking. Conversely, indiscriminately giving fluids to oliguric patients increases the risk of fluid overload with negative consequences on morbidity. Although fluid overload has been identified as independent risk factor for AKI in critically ill patients, "fill and spill" ("fill" the circulation and urine will "spill") is still a dogma in many ICUs. Likewise, the concept of "squeeze and diurese" is commonly applied. It aims to increase mean arterial blood pressure with vasopressors ("squeeze") and at the same time administer loop diuretics to paralyse the medulla and avoid ischaemia ("diurese"). Interestingly, no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) support the latter treatment strategies.

### Association between furosemide administration and outcomes in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury [^116MD64b]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our results demonstrated furosemide administration was associated with reduced short-term mortality in critically ill patients with AKI. The results of the present cohort also suggest that furosemide may promote renal function recovery. Consistent with our study, a previous controlled study found that furosemide appeared to increase renal function recovery rates. Theoretically, furosemide may prevent AKI by decreasing the GFR and tubular workload, and then reduce renal medullary oxygenation. Additionally, some scholars assumed that furosemide could act as renal vasodilators. However, these theoretical arguments were proved in experimental conditions, but not in clinical practice. The results of several previous studies and meta-analysis did not support the use of furosemide in AKI patients, and the KDIGO clinical practice guideline for AKI also suggested against the use of diuretics in AKI management. A recent meta-analysis of 28 randomized controlled trials found that furosemide administration was not associated with increased mortality in patients with or at risk for AKI, and it may reduce mortality when used as a preventive measure. Unfortunately, the severity and fluid status of AKI was not included in the study. It is necessary to further analyze the influence of furosemide on outcomes in different subsets of AKI patients.

Oliguria still represents one of the two main criteria for the diagnosis of AKI, and it is also the main reason for using diuretics. In our cohort, there were 7244 (82%) patients with AKI according to UO criteria alone. Positive fluid balance is an expected complication of oliguria in AKI patients. Furosemide is helpful in the management of fluid overload. The results of the present study showed that positive fluid balance was more common in patients with AKI oliguria stage 2–3, and beneficial effect of furosemide on in-hospital mortality was especially observed in this population. A multicenter ICU study also found that, in patients with a higher fluid balance and a lower volume of urine output, diuretic use was associated with better survival. So, the beneficial effects of furosemide on mortality in oliguric AKI patients may be mediated by fluid balance.

### Furosemide (Lasix) [^114BbqYW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Investigations into the mode of action of LASIX have utilized micropuncture studies in rats, stop flow experiments in dogs and various clearance studies in both humans and experimental animals. It has been demonstrated that LASIX inhibits primarily the absorption of sodium and chloride not only in the proximal and distal tubu but also in the loop of Henle. The high degree of efficacy is largely due to the unique site of action. The action on the distal tubule is independent of any inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase and aldosterone.

Recent evidence suggests that furosemide glucuronide is the only or at least the major biotransformation product of furosemide in man. Furosemide is extensively bound to plasma proteins, mainly to albumin. Plasma concentrations ranging from 1 μg/mL to 400 μg/mL are 91% to 99% bound in healthy individuals. The unbound fraction averages 2.3% to 4.1% at therapeutic concentrations.

The onset of diuresis following oral administration is within 1 hour. The peak effect occurs within the first or second hour. The duration of diuretic effect is 6 to 8 hours.

In fasted normal men, the mean bioavailability of furosemide from LASIX Tablets and LASIX Oral Solution is 64% and 60%, respectively, of that from an intravenous injection of the drug. Although furosemide is more rapidly absorbed from the oral solution (50 minutes) than from the tablet (87 minutes), peak plasma levels and area under the plasma concentration-time curves do not differ significantly. Peak plasma concentrations increase with increasing dose but times-to-peak do not differ among doses. The terminal half-life of furosemide is approximately 2 hours.

Significantly more furosemide is excreted in urine following the IV injection than after the tablet or oral solution. There are no significant differences between the two oral formulations in the amount of unchanged drug excreted in urine.

Geriatric Population

Furosemide binding to albumin may be reduced in elderly patients. Furosemide is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine. The renal clearance of furosemide after intravenous administration in older healthy male subjects (60 to 70 years of age) is statistically significantly smaller than in younger healthy male subjects (20 to 35 years of age). The initial diuretic effect of furosemide in older subjects is decreased relative to younger subjects (s ee PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

### Non-interventional follow-up versus fluid bolus in RESPONSE to oliguria in hemodynamically stable critically ill patients: a randomized controlled pilot trial [^115aqRYL]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Intervention

Patients in the FU group did not receive fluid bolus or diuretics to increase urine output during the 2-h study period. Patients in the FB group received 500 mL balanced crystalloid (Ringer's acetate) infused over 30 min. In both groups, all ongoing infusions such as nutrition and maintenance fluid were infused constant during the 2-h period. Vasoactive drugs, insulin, sedation, and other medications were titrated according to the judgment of the treating clinician, but MAP target level was not modified. Diuretics were not allowed during the 2-h study period. In case of severe hemodynamic instability (need to increase norepinephrine-infusion > 0.2 μg/kg/min from baseline) or heart rate increase > 30 beats/min from baseline (due to suspected hypovolemia), a rescue bolus of 500 mL crystalloid over 30 min was allowed in both groups according to the decision of the treating clinician. Urine output was recorded hourly until 6 h post-randomization.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the number of patients who doubled their urine output using the following definition: the mean cumulative 2-h urine output (mL/kg/h) 2 h randomization divided by the mean cumulative 2-h urine output (mL/kg/h) measured 2 h preceding randomization expressed as percentage. Based on a previous prospective cohort study, we considered doubling of the urine output as a clinically significant increase in urine output among oliguric patients, if urine output increased at least 10 mL/h (i.e. difference between cumulative 2-h urine output post-randomization versus pre-randomization was at least 20 mL).

The secondary outcomes included the change in individual urine output, duration of consecutive oliguria (urine output < 0.5 mL/kg, hours from randomization), and cumulative fluid balance on study day (6 h from randomization).

The exploratory outcomes included physiological effects [i.e. MAP, heart rate, norepinephrine dose, central venous pressure (CVP), difference in core vs. peripheral temperature, capillary refill time (until 60 min), arterial blood pH, standard base excess, arterial lactate] during 2-h period from randomization, number of patients receiving rescue boluses and the number of rescue boluses, number of patients with protocol violations, number of patients with adverse events, highest AKI stage within 24 h, 48 h, and during ICU stay and number of patients receiving RRT. Definitions for protocol violations and adverse events are listed in Additional file 1: Table S2.

### Diuretic efficiency of a single dose of subcutaneous versus oral furosemide after heart failure hospitalization across diuretic resistance strata: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^111XZ7XP]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

The greater efficacy of sc furosemide (vs. oral) in DR patients may be related to its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The biphasic administration of sc furosemide (30 mg over 60 min, then 12.5 mg/h for 4 h) provides more consistent drug levels that is comparable to IV bolus and is higher than what is achieved by oral dose of furosemide. Furthermore, in contrast with the variable absorption of oral furosemide (~50%), which is particularly compromised in HF patients owing to altered gastrointestinal function and oedema, sc furosemide achieves nearly 100% bioavailability. The sc route ensures more reliable drug delivery and a prolonged absorption phase, potentially leading to more sustained diuretic effects in patients with DR.

Several limitations to our study are noteworthy. First, our pilot RCT had a small sample size and tested efficacy of a single dose of diuretic therapy. Second, the single‐centre, open‐label design limits the generalizability of our findings. Third, there was some imbalance in SGLT2i use across treatment arms. However, sensitivity analyses adjusting for the same yielded comparable findings to the primary analysis. Finally, the home diuretic dosing was based on the discretion of the treating physician at discharge without an objective assessment of its adequacy. However, the primary outcome of diuretic efficiency was normalized to the dose of furosemide, limiting the potential for bias from differences in the home diuretic dose. Future larger trials are needed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of sc furosemide as an alternative or add‐on diuretic strategy to oral furosemide for patients with DR and recent ADHF hospitalization.

### High-dose furosemide for established ARF: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial [^114JSi5e]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The effect of furosemide on the survival and renal recovery of patients presenting with acute renal failure (ARF) is still debated.

Methods

Three hundred thirty-eight patients with ARF requiring dialysis therapy were randomly assigned to the administration of either furosemide (25 mg/kg/d intravenously or 35 mg/kg/d orally) or matched placebo, with stratification according to severity at presentation. The primary end point was survival. The secondary end point was number of dialysis sessions. Tertiary end points included time on dialysis therapy, time to achieve a serum creatinine level less than 2.26 mg/dL (< 200 micromol/L), and time to reach a 2-L/d diuresis.

Results

There were no differences in survival and renal recovery rates between the 2 groups. Time to achieve a 2-L/d diuresis was shorter with furosemide (5.7 ± 5.8 days) than placebo (7.8 ± 6.8 days; P = 0.004). Overall, 148 patients achieved a urine output of at least 2 L/d during the study period (94 of 166 patients; 57%) with furosemide versus 54 of 164 patients (33%) with placebo (P < 0.001). However, there were no significant differences in number of dialysis sessions and time on dialysis therapy between the furosemide and placebo groups, even in the subgroup of patients reaching a 2-L/d diuresis.

Conclusion

High-dose furosemide helps maintain urinary output, but does not have an impact on the survival and renal recovery rate of patients with established ARF.

### Diuretic efficiency of a single dose of subcutaneous versus oral furosemide after heart failure hospitalization across diuretic resistance strata: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^11665HMz]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Between 2 June 2023 and 22 April 2024, 70 participants were randomized to sc furosemide or oral furosemide (n = 35 each, n = 23 with vs. n = 12 without DR, online supplementary Figure S1). The mean age was 57 years, 27% were female, and 70% were of Black race (Table 1). Participants with (vs. without) DR (median [interquartile range, IQR] BAN‐ADHF = 14 [13–15] vs. 7.5 [5–9]) had worse kidney function, higher N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide levels, and greater proportion with albuminuria (online supplementary Table S3). Based on the home diuretic regimen, the median [IQR] oral furosemide dose administered was 60 mg [40–80], with a higher dose administered to those with versus without DR (80 vs. 40 mg).

Table 1
Baseline characteristics across the study groups

Diuretic efficiency of subcutaneous furosemide versus oral furosemide

Overall, single sc furosemide (vs. oral furosemide) dose was associated with significantly greater diuretic efficiency over the 8‐h follow‐up (32.5 vs. 25.2 ml/mg; difference [95% confidence interval, CI] 7.3 [1.7–13.1]; p = 0.012). DR significantly modified the treatment effect of sc furosemide (vs. oral furosemide) on diuretic efficiency (p interaction: treatment × DR = 0.022). Participants with DR had significantly greater diuretic efficiency in response to the single dose of sc furosemide versus home oral furosemide (34.0 vs. 22.6 ml/mg, difference [95% CI]: 11.4 [4.4–18.4]; p < 0.01; Figure 1). In contrast, among participants without DR, there was no significant difference in diuretic efficiency between sc furosemide and oral furosemide (29.8 vs. 30.1 ml/mg, difference [95% CI]: −0.3 [−10.1 to 9.4]; p = 0.94). These findings were consistent in a sensitivity analysis adjusting for baseline SGLT2i use (online supplementary Table S4). Additionally, participants with DR had a greater increase in urine output over time with sc furosemide versus oral furosemide than patients without DR (p interaction: treatment × DR × time = 0.02; Figure 2).

Evidentiary table — acute heart failure prognosis and treatment findings include an out-of-hospital treatment study evaluating changes in respiratory rate, in which nitroglycerin and lasix most improved.

### Impact on fluid balance of an optimized restrictive strategy targeting non-resuscitative fluids in intensive care patients with septic shock: a single-blind, multicenter, randomized, controlled, pilot study [^116xc9GX]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this multicenter, single-blind, randomized, controlled, pilot trial, an optimized fluid restriction protocol to reduce "hidden fluid intakes" did not lead to a relative 40% reduction in fluid balance at Day 5 when compared with standard fluid strategy (control group). The fluid balances at Day 3, Day 5, changes in weight, number of days free of organ failure and mortality rate at Day 28 were similar in both groups.

We cannot directly compare our results to previous studies on fluid restriction because OPTIFLUID is the first study which targeted uniquely non resuscitative fluids. Recently, two large RCT assessed the impact of a restrictive strategy applied during the ICU stay focused on all intravenous fluids and not uniquely on resuscitative fluids. In both studies, the restrictive strategy reduced cumulative fluid balance with no effect on mortality rate.

In the CLASSIC trial, Meyhoff et al. found no reduction in 90-day mortality or any other secondary outcome in septic patients. Their fluid restriction protocol focused mostly on resuscitative fluids (intravenous fluid therapy for hypoperfusion or to correct fluid losses or dehydration), with a very aggressive protocol forbidding fluids if the lactate level was lower than 4 mmol/l or in absence of oliguria. However, in a secondary post-hoc analysis this strategy did not seem to affect the time to resolution of hyperlactatemia.

In the POINCARE-2 trial, Bollaert et al. found no reduction in mortality at day 60 or in any other secondary outcome in a broad range of critically ill patients with a fluid restriction protocol based on daily weighing, salt and fluid restriction and the use of furosemide (with or without albumin) during the first two weeks of hospitalization in ICU. In this trail, a higher difference in cumulative fluid balance was obtained with large doses of furosemide and perfusions of 20% albumin. Thus, the findings were probably more dependent on medical treatment (and potential side effects) rather than on the restrictive strategy per se.

Acute kidney injury — pharmacologic prevention/treatment in adults notes that there are no pharmacotherapies available for prevention or treatment of AKI; there are no data to support loop diuretics to prevent AKI; diuretics may be used for treatment of volume overload; one retrospective study suggested mannitol may be beneficial only when creatinine kinase level > 30,000 U/L, but benefit remains undefined and mannitol is contraindicated in oliguria; and low-dose dopamine, fenoldopam, IGF-1, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) should not be used for treatment or prevention of AKI.

### Intravenous furosemide in decompensated heart failure: do not protocolize dosing but the desired effect! [^114S2MWZ]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Palazzuoli and colleagues report on a study comparing continuous versus bolus infusion of furosemide in acute decompensated heart failure. Patients in the continuous infusion group had greater urine output, decreased renal function and increased 6-month mortality.

We feel that, due to the study design, the conclusions drawn are difficult to translate into clinical practice. The decisive advantage of continuous over bolus infusion is the ability to titrate to effect in a gradual and precise manner. This advantage is completely negated when large-step (that is, doubling) dose increases are rigidly protocolized, as was the case in this study. When the advantages of a method are lost, only its comparative harms remain: continuous infusion may have a stronger diuretic effect than bolus infusion (milligram for milligram) and the continuous infusion group in this study seemed overtreated, resulting in renal dysfunction that is associated with poor outcomes.

Future research should focus on the optimal method to attain the clinical goal of inducing sufficient but not excessive diuresis. Comparing outcomes on a protocolized-dose basis is straightforward but cannot elucidate which method is best in practice. Indeed, the authors write that a study utilizing a more tailored dose could further clarify this subject. We suggest that a truly relevant comparison can only be made when treatment in both groups is aimed at individual targets. This would require a large trial with patients optimally treated using either of the two infusion methods, while dosing is completely determined by preset clinically relevant endpoints.

### Diuretics for preventing and treating acute kidney injury [^113s4tXG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a well-known complication of critical illnesses, significantly affecting morbidity and the risk of death. Diuretics are widely used to ameliorate excess fluid accumulation and oliguria associated with AKI. Their popularity stems from their ability to reduce the energy demands of renal tubular cells by inhibiting transporters and flushing out intratubular casts. Numerous studies have assessed the effects of diuretics in the context of AKI prevention and treatment. However, a comprehensive systematic review addressing this topic has yet to be conducted.

Objectives

This review aimed to explore the benefits and harms of diuretics for both the prevention and treatment of AKI.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies was searched up to May 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in which diuretics were used to prevent or treat AKI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data using standardised data extraction forms. Dichotomous outcomes were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where continuous scales of measurement were used to assess the effects of treatment, the standardised mean difference (SMD) was used. The primary review outcomes for AKI prevention studies were the incidence of AKI and any use of kidney replacement therapy (KRT). For treatment studies, the primary outcome was any use of KRT. The certainty of evidence was assessed per outcome using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

We included 64 studies (83 reports, 9871 participants): 53 prevention studies (8078 participants) and 11 treatment studies (1793 participants). Studies were conducted in the following World Health Organization regions: the Americas (15), Eastern Mediterranean (9), Europe (25), South-East Asia (2), and the Western Pacific (13). Thirty-six studies were single-centre studies, 19 were multicentre, and the setting was unclear in nine studies. Diuretics were compared to placebo, no treatment or conventional therapy, saline solutions (isotonic or hypotonic), 5% dextrose, 5% glucose, Hartmann's solution, and Ringer's acetate. Overall, the risk of bias was low in one study, high in 19 studies, and of some concern in 41 studies. Three studies could not be assessed because they did not report any outcomes of interest. For AKI prevention, compared to control, diuretics may reduce the risk of AKI (38 studies, 5540 participants: RR 0.75, 95%, CI 0.61 to 0.92; I² = 77%; low-certainty evidence) and probably reduce any use of KRT (32 studies, 4658 participants: RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.91; I² = 0%, moderate-certainty evidence) and death (33 studies, 6447 participants: RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.92; I² = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence). The use of diuretics may result in little or no difference in the need for permanent dialysis (2 studies, 956 participants: RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.08 to 3.47; I² = 21%; low-certainty evidence), hypotension (7 studies, 775 participants: RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.86; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence) and hypokalaemia (6 studies, 1383 participants: RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.73; I² = 43%; low-certainty evidence), and had uncertain effects on arrhythmias (13 studies, 3375 participants: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.04; I² = 53%; very-low certainty evidence). Diuretics may make little or no difference to changes in SCr within 30 days (8 studies, 646 participants: SMD 0.41, 95% CI -0.01, to 0.83; I² = 82%; low-certainty evidence) but it was uncertain whether diuretics increased urinary output (8 studies, 1155 participants: SMD 1.87, 95% CI -0.20 to 3.95; I² = 99%; very low-certainty evidence). For AKI treatment, diuretics may make little or no difference to any use of KRT (8 studies, 1275 participants: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.04; I² = 2%; low-certainty evidence) or death (14 studies, 2052 participants: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.22; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). Diuretics may increase hypotension (2 studies, 720 participants: RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.41; I² = 90%; low-certainty evidence) and probably increase arrhythmias (6 studies, 1011 participants: RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.33; I² = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence). Diuretics may result in little or no difference in hypokalaemia (3 studies, 478 participants: RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.31; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). It was uncertain whether diuretics increased urinary output (3 studies, 329 participants: SMD 4.40, 95% CI -0.94 to 9.74; I² = 99%; very low-certainty evidence). The need for permanent dialysis and changes in serum creatinine were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

When used for the prevention of AKI, diuretics may reduce the risk of AKI. However, our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. Diuretics probably reduce the incidence of KRT use, and we are moderately confident in the effect estimate. When used for the treatment of AKI, diuretics may make little or no difference to any use of KRT, and our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. More RCTs are needed to explore the role of diuretics for treating established AKI.

### Comparison of intraoperative aminophylline versus furosemide in treatment of oliguria during pediatric cardiac surgery [^111qGHpc]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine if intraoperative aminophylline was superior to furosemide to prevent or attenuate postoperative cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury.

Design

Single-center, historical control, retrospective cohort study.

Setting

PICU, university-affiliated children's hospital.

Patients

Children with congenital heart disease in PICU who received furosemide or aminophylline to treat intraoperative oliguria.

Interventions

Intraoperative oliguria was treated either with furosemide (September 2007 to February 2012) or with aminophylline (February 2012 to June 2013). The postoperative 48 hours renal outcomes of the aminophylline group were compared with the furosemide group. The primary outcomes were acute kidney injury and renal replacement therapy use at 48 hours postoperatively. Surgical complexity was accounted for by the use of Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery-1 score.

Measurements and Main Results

The study involves 69 months of observation. There were 200 cases younger than 21 years old reviewed for this study. Eighty-five cases (42.5%) developed acute kidney injury. The aminophylline group patients produced significantly more urine (mL/kg/hr) during the first 8 hours postoperatively than furosemide patients (5.1 vs 3.4mL/kg/hr; p = 0.01). The urine output at 48 hours postoperatively was similar between the two groups. There was no difference in acute kidney injury incidence at 48 hours between the aminophylline and furosemide groups (38% vs 47%, respectively; p = 0.29). Fewer aminophylline group subjects required renal replacement therapy compared to the furosemide group subjects (n = 1 vs 7, respectively; p = 0.03). In the multi-variant predictive model, intraoperative aminophylline infusion was noted as a negative predictive factor for renal replacement therapy, but not for cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury.

Conclusion

The intraoperative use of aminophylline was more effective than furosemide in reversal of oliguria in the early postoperative period. There were less renal replacement therapy-requiring acute kidney injury in children in the aminophylline group. Future prospective studies of intraoperative aminophylline to prevent cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury may be warranted.

### Self-care of heart failure patients: practical management recommendations from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^114poBeZ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice and patients' perspectives

Reactions to symptoms need to be adapted to the individual patient. Due to changes in the patients' condition (either HF related to other reasons) the medication regimen might need to be changed (see part on side effects and medication), physical activity level and exercise training decreased, or a (temporary) change in their sodium or fluid intake needed.

Furthermore, diuretic therapy is used to treat signs and/or symptoms of congestion.

The goal of diuretic therapy is to achieve and maintain euvolaemia with the lowest achievable dose. However, clinical assessment of euvolaemia may be difficult and many patients remain congested despite increase in HF therapy. 119 The dose of the diuretic must be adjusted according to individual needs over time. A patient‐directed flexible diuretic dosing schedule based on personalized variation in fluid‐related signs and symptoms is safe in patients with chronic HF. Some patients and families might not feel comfortable making decisions to change medications or lifestyle and need support from the health care providers.

Professional attitudes and behaviour
Provide individualized information to support self‐care management to patients and caregivers. Patients may adjust diuretic therapy and/or alert their health care team in case of increasing signs and symptoms (e.g. dyspnoea, oedema, hypotension), or a sudden unexpected weight gain of > 2 kg in 3 days as a rule of thumb; however, this may need to be tailored to the individual patient.
In selected euvolaemic/hypovolaemic patients, the use of a diuretic drug might be (temporarily) discontinued.
In patients with severe generalized congestion, especially in those with gut oedema, the effect of oral furosemide may be altered due to inadequate gastro‐intestinal absorption. A change in diuretics or a switch to intravenous furosemide is recommended in order to increase diuresis, reduce generalized congestion and gut oedema and re‐establish gastro‐intestinal absorption for oral diuretics.
Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors and diuretic therapy continued during acute hypovolaemic illness significantly increase the risk of acute kidney injury and/or hyperkalaemia. One or more of these agents may need to be temporarily stopped or its dose reduced during illness. Particularly the diuretics and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists migth need to be reduced/temporarily stopped (early).

Recommendations for future research

### Fluid balance and urine volume are independent predictors of mortality in acute kidney injury [^114We69o]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Early and appropriate goal-directed fluid therapy is fundamental in acute resuscitation of critically ill patients; however, it is almost always associated with a certain degree of fluid overload (FO), which promotes tissue edema that could potentially contribute to progressive organ dysfunction.

There is a growing amount of evidence supporting the relation between FO and unfavorable outcomes in critically ill patients. This has been demonstrated in general ICUs and in specific clinical settings, such as acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS), in patients undergoing abdominal surgery, cardiac surgery and in septic patients. With regard to acute kidney injury (AKI) in particular, multiple pediatric studies have shown that a greater FO at the time of renal replacement therapy (RRT) is associated with higher mortality. In a small study of 81 adult AKI patients who underwent RRT, a volume-related weight gain (VRWG) > 10%, used as a surrogate for FO, was similarly associated with poor outcomes. An association between FO and higher mortality has also been shown in critically ill patients with less severe forms of AKI. In this context, FO has emerged as a potential 'biomarker' in critical illness, and it has been proposed that its prevention may be an important determinant of survival, particularly in AKI.

Oliguria is a common situation in the ICU and is considered an early and sensitive biomarker of renal injury because it may precede a creatinine-based diagnosis of AKI. Furthermore, in multicenter studies on critically ill patients with AKI, the presence of oliguria has been associated with higher mortality. Indeed, the evidence points out that both FO and oliguria are important predictors of mortality in critically ill patients. Fluid accumulation is a logical and expected complication of oliguric AKI due to impaired water and sodium excretion. It remains unclear whether their effects are independent of each other or if FO is merely in the causal pathway between oliguria and death. Interestingly, very few studies have adjusted for urine output in the analysis on FO and mortality. In 81 AKI patients requiring RRT, both oliguria and FO were independent predictors of mortality and in a post hoc analysis of 306 AKI patients from the Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial (FACTT), FO was shown to be independently associated with mortality both in oliguric and non-oliguric patients. In a large multicenter European study on critically ill patients with AKI, a positive fluid balance was an important factor associated with increased 60-day mortality, but there was no adjustment for urine volume or oliguria.

### Association between diuretics and successful discontinuation of continuous renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury [^117Us2TH]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we demonstrated that starting diuretics at the cessation of CRRT contributes to successful discontinuation of CRRT by reducing volume overload risk in critically ill patients with AKI. Patients treated with diuretics following CRRT had a greater increase in UO, with tolerable elevation of sCr not only in the CRRT discontinuation group, but also in other groups. Continuous infusion of furosemide increased UO more effectively compared to other methods. High day − 1 UO, use of diuretics, and short duration of CRRT were predictors of successful discontinuation of CRRT. The cutoff values for day − 1 UO for predicting successful discontinuation of CRRT in all patients and oliguric patients in the diuretics group were 191 mL/day and 125 mL/day, respectively.

Most patients who survive AKI requiring CRRT are reported to recover from oliguria and uremic complications after 12–13 days of RRT. Insufficient urine volume is a common problem in critically ill patients with AKI when discontinuation of CRRT is under consideration. Re-initiation of CRRT is required in a substantial portion of patients with incomplete renal recovery. Previous studies have reported that furosemide does not improve renal outcome after RRT. Uchino et al. reported an association between diuretic therapy within 24 h before stopping CRRT and successful discontinuation of CRRT. However, no previous reports have focused on the clinical impact of diuretic therapy initiated after stopping CRRT on successful discontinuation of CRRT and optimal indications or appropriate administration methods for diuretics following CRRT, even though a positive fluid balance is associated with delayed recovery of kidney function and increased mortality. Our large cohort study demonstrated that diuretics were significantly associated with successful discontinuation of CRRT, and continuous infusion of furosemide was more effective at increasing UO than other methods of administering diuretics. Diuretic therapy was even effective in oliguric patients with UO greater than 125 mL/day before stopping CRRT.

Statistical analysis

Baseline characteristics were compared between randomization groups and DR strata using Kruskal–Wallis tests for continuous variables and chi‐square tests for categorical variables. Treatment effect of sc furosemide versus oral furosemide on diuretic efficiency was assessed as the difference in estimated marginal means of the cumulative urine output on follow‐up (up to 8 h) per mg of furosemide modelled as a repeated measure over time using linear mixed‐effect models. The model included treatment group, DR strata, and timepoint as fixed effects and participant as a random effect. A treatment × DR strata interaction term was also included in the model. Effect modification of DR on cumulative urine output over time (slope) was assessed with a three‐way interaction term (treatment × time × DR strata) and visualized using restricted cubic spline. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted for the primary outcome of diuretic efficiency adjusting for baseline sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) use. Linear mixed‐effect models were constructed to evaluate the treatment effect of sc furosemide versus oral furosemide on spot UNa concentration on follow‐up, including peak UNa (observed at hour 4). Analyses used R version 4.2.1, with significance at p < 0.05.

Diuretic therapy (Figure 6) — in hospitalized heart failure, initiate IV loop diuretics early (ED or immediately after admission) with an initial dose usually 1–2.5 times total daily oral loop diuretic agent in furosemide equivalents, and prescribe IV diuretics every 8–12 hrs or continuous while measuring daily weights and urine output and monitoring vital signs and congestion; consider addition of SGLT inhibitors for chronic therapy and consider adjunct diuretic agent such as acetazolamide. For Adequate diuresis, continue diuretics with target relief of congestion and plan for transition to oral therapy. For Inadequate diuresis, usually increase loop diuretic agent dose by 50%-100% and consider other thiazides or additional diuretic agents. For Refractory to diuretics, change course by escalating diuretics, considering additional diuretic agents or other decongestion strategies, and consider hemodynamic monitoring to guide therapy.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was cumulative fluid balance at 72 h after randomization adjusted for stratification variables. Secondary outcomes included duration of AKI in days defined by the KDIGO creatinine and urine output criteria (truncated at ICU discharge or 14 days whichever came first), number of patients requiring RRT (truncated at 14 days, including initiation of RRT after ICU discharge), cumulative fluid balance at 24 h after randomization and at ICU discharge (or truncated at 7 days if ICU stay exceeded 7 days), and cumulative dose of diuretics (furosemide) during the intervention period (while in the ICU, maximum of 7 days) adjusted for the duration of the observation period.

Exploratory outcomes included days free of mechanical ventilation and alive at 14 days, days free of vasopressors and alive at 14 days, days free of ICU and alive at 14 days, days free of RRT and alive (assessed at 90 days), 90-days dialysis dependence and 90-days mortality. The safety and feasibility outcomes included the number of patients with one or more (serious) adverse events (AE) and reactions in both arms (detailed definitions are provided in Table S3), screened versus recruited patients ratio, recruitment rate (patients/center/month), and protocol compliance (number of patients with protocol violations in both arms).

Decongestion with diuretic and adjunctive therapy — initial inpatient dosing and continuation: Establishing an effective diuretic regimen is crucial for achieving decongestion, and first doses, often given in the emergency department (ED), are generally based on previous home loop diuretic doses, as in the DOSE (Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation) trial. For patients already on outpatient loop diuretics, the total daily dose should be changed to an oral furosemide equivalent and administered intravenously (IV) at 1 to 2.5 times the total daily dose. For patients not previously on outpatient diuretics, the initial furosemide dose usually is around 40 to 80 mg IV daily. In the DOSE trial, initiation of the 2.5 times higher dose led to 37% more fluid loss, 43% more weight loss, and greater dyspnea relief by 72 hours. Diuretic agents are usually continued throughout the early hospital stay, either by IV bolus every 8 to 12 hours or by continuous IV infusion.

Loop diuretic therapy in hospitalized heart failure — dosing and monitoring is outlined as follows: Table 7A provides guidance on timing and dosing for initiation of sacubitril/valsartan based on patient profile as represented in the randomized ARNI trials; subsequent IV diuretic doses are modified to achieve the desired daily response, and doses are often doubled until reaching 400 to 500 mg of furosemide equivalent per day; when the response is brisk but transient, the frequency should be increased to 3 to 4 times daily; the DOSE trial did not demonstrate improved outcomes with continuous infusion of IV furosemide, but patients with chronic furosemide equivalent doses of over 240 mg daily were excluded, while a Cochrane review suggested that loop diuretic agent infusions may produce greater net diuresis and better tolerability at equivalent doses compared with bolus dosing; measurement of urine sodium shortly after the start of therapy can be useful to evaluate diuretic responsiveness, with a spot urine sodium content < 50 mEq/L at 2 hours after the diuretic dose correlated with a poor diuretic response and suggests consideration of dose.

### ASN kidney health guidance on the outpatient management of patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury [^112TMH4G]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

AKI-D volume management and ultrafiltration — volume and BP assessments need to be conducted at every hemodialysis treatment to set fluid removal goals, and volume management may require a degree of permissive hypervolemia to minimize hypovolemia-induced hypotension; in patients with AKI-D, a more conservative ultrafiltration approach has been associated with lower intradialytic hypotension and we suggest that prescribed ultrafiltration should be < 10 ml/kg per hour. In nonoliguric patients, loop diuretics can help control fluid accumulation and reduce ultrafiltration needs, and we suggest a trial of furosemide 160 mg twice a day (or equivalent dose of torsemide or bumetanide) in all patients with AKI except those with already significant urine output and minimal interdialytic weight gain (< 1 kg); in patients who remain oligoanuric, diuretics can be held until there is a reported or documented increase in urine output. Cool dialysate reduces intradialytic hypotension in ESRD and has been found beneficial in the AKI-D setting and is therefore a reasonable tool for patients at higher risk of intradialytic hemodynamic instability.

### Development of an optimal furosemide infusion strategy in infants with modeling and simulation [^114F1K2X]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal dosing strategy for continuous intravenous furosemide infusion is unknown in pediatric patients. Eighteen patients less than 1 year old were studied after cardiac surgery during routine clinical care. The current strategy starts with a continuous infusion of 0.1 mg/kg x h, which may be adapted.

Methods

A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model was developed that linked furosemide dose to furosemide serum concentrations, renal function (creatinine clearance), and urine output. Various regimens were simulated that adapt according to urine production. The modified dosing schedule was prospectively tested in a subsequent population of 18 pediatric patients after cardiac surgery.

Results

Data from the follow-up study suggest that urine production is more controlled for the proposed regimen.

Conclusions

Both the modeling and simulation results and the follow-up study indicated that a bolus dose of 1 mg/kg followed 6 hours later with a 1- or 2-mg/kg loading dose and a 0.2-mg/kg x. h intravenous infusion provides a rational starting point for furosemide therapy after cardiac surgery in pediatric patients less than 1 year old. Adjustment of this regimen every 12 hours in steps of 0.1 mg/kg x h on the basis of clinical assessment should lead to adequate control over urinary output.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^116rQbaU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Loop diuretics in dialysis patients — Large doses of potent loop diuretics (furosemide, bumetanide, or torsemide) can be administered to promote loss of sodium and water, but therapy is effective only when RKF is high enough to provide daily urine output of at least 100 mL and its effectiveness may not last long. Loop diuretics should be used with caution because of the possibility of ototoxicity, with the incidence appearing greater with furosemide and much less with bumetanide or torsemide.

### Loop diuretic use in patients with AKI: different severity, different response [^117DUXbi]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Recently, Dr. Bove and his colleagues performed an excellent systematic review and reported that furosemide exhibited a neutral effect in acute kidney injury (AKI) treatment (odds ratio (OR) 1.14; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.72). Despite being well designed, several limitations should be noted. First, the potential heterogeneity needs to be addressed. In this meta-analysis, three different interventions were combined in the control group, including placebo, continuous furosemide infusion, and torasemide administration. However, from a clinical aspect, comparability of therapeutic strategies is a prerequisite for a meta-analysis. Simply taking all these interventions as one control treatment is inappropriate and difficult to interpret for clinical meaning, despite the heterogeneity not being significant (I 2 = 0). Second, the effect of furosemide in AKI remains inconsistent. We noticed that the associations between poor outcomes and furosemide were more frequently reported in cohorts with higher serum creatinine (sCr) (3.8 mg/dl, 3.3 mg/dl) while insignificant in patients with mild AKI (1.8 mg/dl). Considering that fluid accumulation is a common issue in AKI, we speculate that patients with mild AKI are more likely to respond to furosemide challenge and the side effects of furosemide, such as oxidative stress, may be overwhelmed by the reduced fluid accumulation. In the current comparison, we performed a subgroup analysis according to different control treatments (Additional file 1). In all four studies using placebo as control (Cantarovich, Cantarovich, Kleinknecht, and Shilliday), all the patients were described as having acute kidney failure (which indicates severe AKI) and the pooled effect was insignificant (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.59; p = 0.78). However, in another four studies using continuous furosemide infusion as control treatment, only one study (Brown) was reported as ARF, and an extremely high dose of furosemide was used in this study (1000 mg/24 h, bolus vs 3000 mg/24 h, continuous). The severity of AKI in another three studies (sCr 1.4 mg/dl in Kunt, 2.1 mg/dl in Schuller, and 1.3 mg/dl in Shah) was mild and when excluding these studies, the pooled outcome showed that continuous furosemide infusion was associated with lower mortality (OR 3.82; 95% CI 1.30 to 11.28; p = 0.024). Thus, we think combining different treatment strategies as control treatment may cause biased conclusions. Finally, this is an enlightening study, and further investigations regarding whether continuous furosemide therapy could reduce the mortality rate in AKI patients are needed.

### Development and standardization of a furosemide stress test to predict the severity of acute kidney injury [^112rWENs]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Key Messages

- The furosemide stress test (FST) is feasible and well-tolerated in critically ill patients with early AKI.

- The performance of the FST to predict the primary outcome was robust and consistent in both cohorts, with a range in ROC AUC of 0.82 to 0.87.

- Patients should be euvolemic before undertaking any type of furosemide challenge, and volume replacement is mandatory in patients who are not obviously volume overloaded.

- FST should be conducted in an appropriate clinical setting where UO, heart rate, and blood pressure can be monitored frequently.

- FST is a novel dynamic functional assessment of tubular function that appears to have good predictive capacity to identify those patients who will progress to advanced-stage AKI. Further validation studies of the FST are warranted.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^117JZ2ik]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Table 13 — FDA-approved drugs for treatment of hypertension — Loop diuretics (alternative agents) include bumetanide 0.5–2 mg/d (daily frequency 2), furosemide 20–80 mg/d (daily frequency 2), and torsemide 5–10 mg/d (daily frequency 1). These are preferred diuretics in patients with symptomatic HF. They are preferred over thiazide-type diuretics in patients with moderate-to-severe CKD (eg, GFR < 30 mL/min). The longer-acting choice of torsemide is preferred for treatment of hypertension. A loop diuretic is an option for patients who develop thiazide-type diuretic associated hyponatremia.

Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) — volume overload and diuretic management — states that approximately 70% of patients with ADHF have signs and symptoms of elevated ventricular filling pressures, and that loop diuretics such as furosemide, torsemide, and bumetanide are the mainstay of treatment for volume overload; HF specialists should select the most appropriate agent, dose, and route, recognize the deleterious effects of excessive diuretic use and select the lowest effective dose, and when resistance occurs must reassess the plan, adjust dose, use synergistic diuretics, and initiate therapies that augment cardiac output and renal blood flow, while balancing chronic neurohumoral blockade against hemodynamic derangements during ADHF.

### Use of fenoldopam to increase urine output in a patient with renal insufficiency secondary to septic shock: a case report [^115ExXeU]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

We describe the use of fenoldopam to increase urine output in a pediatric patient with sepsis, heart failure, oliguria, and volume overload.

Design

Case report.

Setting

A tertiary pediatric intensive care unit.

Patient

A 17-year-old male who was being treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and was admitted from outside the hospital to the pediatric intensive care unit, in septic shock, after a course of chemotherapy.

Interventions

A continuous fenoldopam infusion of 0.03 microg/kg/min was added to a regimen of multiple inotropic and vasopressor agents and a furosemide continuous infusion.

Measurements and Main Results

Urine output increased 586% 12 hrs after starting the fenoldopam infusion and 775% from baseline 24 hrs after starting the infusion. Diuretics were decreased while maintaining adequate urine output. No hypotension was noted.

Conclusions

Fenoldopam increased urine output in a pediatric patient who was in septic shock and oliguria. The mechanism for this effect is unclear, and further trials are necessary to determine the role of fenoldopam in this patient population.

### Continuous versus bolus intermittent loop diuretic infusion in acutely decompensated heart failure: a prospective randomized trial [^114KwYW3]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation (DOSE) trial was a prospective, double-blind study in which researchers randomly assigned 308 subjects with ADHF to high-dose versus low-dose and continuous versus intermittent infusion of furosemide. This study did not reveal positive outcomes in either primary or secondary endpoints comparing continuous infusion to a bolus regimen. However, there were higher rates of acute kidney injury (AKI) in the high-dose arm. Thus, equipoise remains on this issue. Our study aimed to evaluate the effects of continuous infusion of furosemide in comparison with a twice daily regimen at similar doses, on biomarker and clinical parameters.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^112epHiQ]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

There is no universally recommended FR limit. For FR to be effective, there must be negative fluid balance — with electrolyte-free water output exceeding input. For this reason, US recommendations suggest FR that is 500 mL below the 24-hour urine output, which is a "rule of thumb" to achieve this (given the difficulty of measuring insensible losses). For consistency, most available studies evaluate FR in the range of 500 to 1000 mL. The efficacy of a 1000-mL FR was recently evaluated in comparison to no treatment, in a randomized trial in 46 patients (mean age 73 years) with chronic asymptomatic hyponatremia, mean baseline pNa 127 mmol/L. This trial observed a modest early rise in serum sodium of 3 mmol/L in fluid-restricted patients, compared to 1 mmol/L with no treatment (allowed ad libitum fluid intake, average intake 1.5 L). However, 39% patients assigned to FR did not respond, with serum sodium persistently below 130 mmol/L after 3 days. Notably, 9 of 23 (39%) participants receiving no treatment achieved pNa greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L after 4 days, illustrating a relatively high rate of "spontaneous correction" even in chronic hyponatremia. These results were similar to the Thai EFFUSE-FLUID trial of 92 participants with hyponatremia, mean age 59 years, that evaluated FR (limit 500–1000 mL), determined based on urine/serum electrolyte ratio (ie, Fürst ratio, discussed later) with or without furosemide and oral salt tablets. This trial reported a mean increase in pNa of 5 mmol/L after 4 days in the 31 patients allocated to FR alone; however, there was no control group. In the group allocated to FR alone, 52% had pNa persistently below 130 mmol/L after 4 days and 26% had pNa less than 130 mmol/L after 30 days. Regarding the "dose" of FR, across this study as a whole, 57% participants were allocated to FR less than 1000 mL and 43% to less than 500 mL, based on prespecified criteria for urine:serum electrolyte ratio. Adherence to FR was much lower, with the 500 mL limit (43% vs 79% for the 1000 mL limit) suggesting this tighter limit was not as well tolerated. In a Swiss prospective observational trial, total daily fluid intake (above or below 500 mL) was not significantly associated with nonresponse to FR, indicating marginal benefit to a tighter restriction. In general, a FR limit of 1000 mL per day is the most widely studied, and any benefits to a restriction limit below this are unproven.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to management of ascites, diuretic therapy, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to add furosemide (starting at 40 mg/day PO, and increasing in 40 mg steps to a maximum of 160 mg/day if there is no response to lower doses) in patients not responding to mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (as defined by a body weight reduction of < 2 kg/week), or in patients developing hyperkalemia.

### SNMMI procedure standard / EANM practice guideline for diuretic renal scintigraphy in adults with suspected upper urinary tract obstruction 1.0 [^117Xzi2w]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Diuretic renal scintigraphy — dose of furosemide states that the standard adult dose of furosemide is 0.5 mg/kg or 40 mg; in adults with normal renal function, 40 mg produces maximal diuresis with urine flow rates reaching approximately 20 mL/min within 3–6 minutes, and a 20- to 30- mg dose usually produces adequate diuresis in a young adult with normal renal function, whereas patients with impaired renal function may not have an adequate response to 40 mg and the dose may need to be increased. In the dual-acquisition protocol, 99mTc-MAG3 clearance can be measured at the time of the baseline study, and if the 99mTc-MAG3 clearance is reduced by 50%, secretion of furosemide will also be reduced by about 50% so the administered dose will need to be doubled; an abnormal serum creatinine level usually implies at least a 50% decrease in glomerular filtration rate. Because no diuretic renography studies have compared 40 mg with higher doses in patients with reduced function, no specific recommendations can be made on the relationship between dose and serum creatinine or 99mTc-MAG3 clearance; a reasonable approach is to double the dose of furosemide to 80 mg for elevated creatinine or a 99mTc-MAG3 clearance rate that is reduced by 50% or more, and consideration may be given to increasing the dose to above 80 mg in patients with severely compromised function.

Cumulative urine output per milligram of furosemide over the 8‐h study period stratified by treatment arm and diuretic resistance (DR) strata. Solid lines represent the estimated marginal means for each group from a linear mixed‐effects model.

In the overall trial cohort, UNa concentrations did not differ significantly between treatment groups at any time point (online supplementary Table S5). However, in patients with DR, sc furosemide (vs. oral furosemide) resulted in numerically greater UNa concentration at each time point, including significantly greater peak UNa at hour 4 on follow‐up (Figure 3). In contrast, peak UNa was not significantly different between sc furosemide versus oral furosemide in participants without DR. The interaction between treatment arm × DR strata for peak UNa outcome was not statistically significant (p interaction: treatment × DR = 0.24; Figure 1).

Figure 3
Urine sodium concentration after subcutaneous (sc) versus oral furosemide stratified by those (A) with diuretic resistance (DR) and (B) without DR. Urine sodium concentrations are shown at hours 2, 4, 6, and 8 after treatment with either sc or oral furosemide stratified by DR. Values shown are estimated marginal means and 95% confidence intervals from linear mixed‐effect models.

Safety and clinical outcomes

In the sc furosemide arm, four devices stopped the infusion mid‐cycle due to needle displacement outside of the sc space (n = 3) or fluid ingress into the device (n = 1). Kidney function and potassium levels at the end of study visit were comparable between sc furosemide versus oral furosemide groups (Table 2). Rates of ED visits or HF hospitalization on follow‐up were also not different between the two treatment arms (Table 2). There was one death reported within 1 week of the study visit that was unrelated to the study.

### Furosemide [^112prNRa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric patients — The usual initial dose of oral furosemide in pediatric patients is 2 mg/kg body weight, given as a single dose. If the diuretic response is not satisfactory after the initial dose, dosage may be increased by 1 or 2 mg/kg no sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose. Doses greater than 6 mg/kg body weight are not recommended. For maintenance therapy in pediatric patients, the dose should be adjusted to the minimum effective level.

Hypertension

Therapy should be individualized according to the patient's response to gain maximal therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose needed to maintain the therapeutic response.

Adults — The usual initial dose of furosemide for hypertension is 80mg, usually divided into 40mg twice a day. Dosage should then be adjusted according to response. If response is not satisfactory, add other antihypertensive agents.

Changes in blood pressure must be carefully monitored when furosemide is used with other antihypertensive drugs, especially during initial therapy. To prevent excessive drop in blood pressure, the dosage of other agents should be reduced by at least 50% when furosemide is added to the regimen. As the blood pressure falls under the potentiating effect of furosemide, a further reduction in dosage or even discontinuation of other antihypertensive drugs may be necessary.

Geriatric patients — In general, dose selection and dose adjustment for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

### Loop diuretics in acute heart failure: beyond the decongestive relief for the kidney [^114GBUa1]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

In patients with acute heart failure (AHF), the risk of death or rehospitalization within 60 days from admission ranges from 30 to 60%, depending on the population studied. The symptoms that drive hospital admission are linked to congestion, and loop diuretics are the most common initial therapeutic approach (used in 90% of cases). These agents promptly improve symptoms and have been shown to reduce dyspnea scores and peripheral edema. However, loop diuretics have been associated with increased rates of mortality and readmission in a graded fashion with cumulative dose and with continuous infusions. It is unclear whether this association is due to confounding by indication or whether adverse events lead to clinically meaningful outcomes accounting for these observations. In this context, neither European Society of Cardiology nor American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines provide any specific recommendation regarding starting and maintaining dosage, oral or intravenous infusion, and time course of treatment. Thus, despite the clinical efficacy of these drugs in providing decongestion and symptomatic improvement, several questions remain to be answered about the optimal approach in any given patient providing diuresis and decongestion but not tipping the balance leading to acute kidney injury (AKI), electrolyte disturbances, and worse outcomes.

Regarding specific circumstances for nephrotic syndrome in children, more specifically with respect to patients with congenital nephrotic syndrome (diuretics), ERN ERKNet/ESPN 2021 guidelines recommend to administer furosemide 0.5–2 mg/kg per dose, IV or PO, up to 6 times daily, with a dose of maximum 10 mg/kg/day, based on the degree of edema and achieved diuresis, unless the patient has evidence of intravascular hypovolemia. Do not administer dosages > 6 mg/kg/day for periods > 1 week. Administer infusions over 5–30 minutes to minimize ototoxicity.

### Peritoneal dialysis vs furosemide for prevention of fluid overload in infants after cardiac surgery: a randomized clinical trial [^113wYE3Q]. JAMA Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Fluid overload after congenital heart surgery is frequent and a major cause of morbidity and mortality among infants. Many programs have adopted the use of peritoneal dialysis (PD) for fluid management; however, its benefits compared with those of traditional diuretic administration are unknown.

Objective

To determine whether infants randomized to PD vs furosemide for the treatment of oliguria have a higher incidence of negative fluid balance on postoperative day 1, as well as avoidance of 10% fluid overload; shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit stay, and inotrope use; and fewer electrolyte abnormalities.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This single-center, unblinded, randomized clinical trial compared methods of fluid removal after cardiac surgery from October 1, 2011, through March 13, 2015, in a large tertiary pediatric hospital in Ohio. The parents or guardians of all eligible infants (aged < 6 months) undergoing cardiac surgery with catheter placement for PD were approached for inclusion. No patients were withdrawn for adverse effects. Recruitment was powered for the primary outcome, and analysis was based on intention to treat. Patients randomized to PD were hypothesized to have superior outcomes.

Interventions

Infants received intravenous furosemide (1 mg/kg every 6 hours) or a standardized PD regimen.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was incidence of negative fluid balance on postoperative day 1. Secondary end points included incidence of fluid overload, duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit stay, electrolyte abnormalities and repletion doses, duration of inotropic administration, and mortality.

Results

Seventy-three patients (47 boys [64%] and 26 girls [35%]; median age, 8 [interquartile range (IQR), 6–14] days) received treatment and completed the trial. No difference was found between the PD and furosemide groups in the incidence of negative fluid balance on the first postoperative day. The furosemide group was 3 times more likely to have 10% fluid overload (odds ratio [OR], 3.0; 95% CI, 1.3–6.9), was more likely to have prolonged ventilator use (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.2–8.2), and had a longer duration of inotrope use (median, 5.5 [IQR, 4–8] vs 4.0 [IQR, 3–6] days) and higher electrolyte abnormality scores (median, 6 [IQR, 4–7] vs 3 [IQR, 2–5]) compared with the PD group. No statistically significant differences in mortality (3 patients [9.4%] in the furosemide group vs 1 patient [3.1%] in the PD group) or length of cardiac intensive care unit (median, 7 [IQR, 6–12] vs 9 [IQR, 5–15] days) or hospital (15 [IQR, 10–28] vs 14 [IQR, 9–22] days) stay were observed. No serious complications were observed. Dialysis was discontinued early in 9 of 41 patients in the PD group for pleural-peritoneal communication.

Conclusions and Relevance

Use of PD is safe and allows for superior fluid management with improved clinical outcomes compared with diuretic administration. Use of PD should be strongly considered among infants at high risk for postoperative acute kidney injury and fluid overload.

### Interactions… [^116Stznm]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Furosemide, sold under the brand name Lasix among others, is a loop diuretic medication used to treat edema due to heart failure, liver scarring, or kidney disease. Furosemide may also be used for the treatment of high blood pressure. It can be taken intravenously or orally. When given intravenously, furosemide typically takes effect within five minutes; when taken orally, it typically metabolizes within an hour. Furosemide works by decreasing the reabsorption of sodium by the kidneys. Common side effects of furosemide injection include hypokalemia, hypotension, and dizziness. Furosemide is also used for liver cirrhosis, kidney impairment, nephrotic syndrome, in adjunct therapy for swelling of the brain or lungs where rapid diuresis is required, and in the management of severe hypercalcemia in combination with adequate rehydration.

Kidney disease In chronic kidney diseases with hypoalbuminemia, furosemide is used along with albumin to increase diuresis. It is also used along with albumin in nephrotic syndrome to reduce edema. Other information Furosemide is mainly excreted by tubular secretion in the kidney. In kidney impairment, clearance is reduced, increasing the risk of adverse effects. Lower initial doses are recommended in older patients and high doses may be needed in kidney failure. It can also cause kidney damage; this is mainly by loss of excessive fluid, and is usually reversible. Furosemide acts within 1 hour of oral administration. Diuresis is usually complete within 6–8 hours of oral administration, but there is significant variation between individuals. Adverse effects Furosemide also can lead to gout caused by hyperuricemia. Hyperglycemia is also a common side effect.

The tendency, as for all loop diuretics, to cause low serum potassium concentration has given rise to combination products, either with potassium or with the potassium-sparing diuretic amiloride. Other electrolyte abnormalities that can result from furosemide use include hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia. Furosemide is a known ototoxic agent generally causing transient hearing loss but can be permanent. Reported cases of furosemide-induced hearing loss appeared to be associated with rapid intravenous administration, high dosages, concomitant renal disease, and coadministration with other ototoxic medication. However, a recently reported longitudinal study showed that participants treated with loop diuretics over 10 years were 40% more likely to develop hearing loss and 33% more likely of progressive hearing loss compared to participants who did not use loop diuretics.

This suggests the long-term consequences of loop diuretics on hearing could be a more significant than previously thought and further research is required in this area. Other precautions include nephrotoxicity, sulfonamide allergy, and increased free thyroid hormone effects with large doses. Potentially hazardous interactions with other drugs:

- **Analgesics**: increased risk of kidney damage with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; antagonism of diuretic effect with NSAIDs
- **Antiarrhythmics**: a risk of cardiac toxicity exists with antiarrhythmics if hypokalemia occurs; the effects of lidocaine and mexiletine are antagonized. Mechanism of action Furosemide, like other loop diuretics, acts by inhibiting the luminal Na–K–Cl cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, by binding to the Na-K-2Cl transporter, thus causing more sodium, chloride, and potassium to be excreted in the urine.

### The short-term effect of furosemide on electrolyte and water excretion in patients with severe renal disease… [^11771z1T]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The short-term effect of intravenously given furosemide on electrolyte and water excretion was evaluated in 11 adults with severe renal insufficiency and edema. Furosemide administration induced an increase in urine flow and sodium excretion in each patient, but the observed diureses were sufficient to afford practical benefit only in patients whose glomerular filtration rates were 5 ml/min or greater. The magnitude of the observed diuresis appeared directly related to the degree of filtration rate reduction, but an obvious relationship between filtration rate and fractional changes of water and electrolyte excretion was not observed. An increase in urine potassium excretion usually occurred and appeared to be a function of increased urine flow rather than increased concentration of potassium in urine.

### Diuresis… [^1162UFaQ]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

In healthy people, the drinking of extra water produces mild diuresis to maintain the body water balance. Many people with health issues, such as heart failure and kidney failure, need diuretic medications to help their kidneys deal with the fluid overload of edema. These drugs promote water loss via urine production. The concentrations of electrolytes in the blood are closely linked to fluid balance, so any action or problem involving fluid intake or output can require management of electrolytes, whether through self-care in mild cases or with help from health professionals in moderate or severe cases. Osmotic diuresis Osmotic diuresis is the increase of urination rate caused by the presence of certain substances in the proximal tubule of the kidneys.

The excretion occurs when substances such as glucose enter the kidney tubules and cannot be reabsorbed. The substances cause an increase in the osmotic pressure within the tubule, causing retention of water within the lumen, and thus reduces the reabsorption of water, increasing urine output. The same effect can be seen in therapeutics such as mannitol, which is used to increase urine output and decrease extracellular fluid volume. Substances in the circulation can also increase the amount of circulating fluid by increasing the osmolarity of the blood. This has the effect of pulling water from the interstitial space, making more water available in the blood, and causing the kidney to compensate by removing it as urine.

In hypotension, colloids are used often intravenously to increase circulating volume in themselves, but as they exert a certain amount of osmotic pressure, water is therefore also moved, further increasing circulating volume. As blood pressure increases, the kidney removes the excess fluid as urine. Sodium, chloride and potassium are excreted in osmotic diuresis, originating from diabetes mellitus. Osmotic diuresis results in dehydration from polyuria and the classic polydipsia associated with DM. Forced diuresis Forced diuresis may enhance the excretion of certain drugs in urine and is used to treat drug overdose or poisoning of these drugs and hemorrhagic cystitis. Diuretics Most diuretic drugs are either weak acids or weak bases. When urine is made alkaline, elimination of acidic drugs in the urine is increased. The converse applies for alkaline drugs.

This method is only of therapeutic significance where the drug is excreted in active form in urine and where the pH of urine can be adjusted to levels above or below the pK value of the active form of drug. For acidic drugs, urine pH should be above the pK value of that drug, and converse for the basic drugs. It is because the ionization of acidic drug is increased in alkaline urine and ionized drugs cannot easily cross a plasma membrane so cannot re-enter blood from kidney tubules. This method is ineffective for drugs that are strongly protein bound or which have a large apparent volume of distribution. For forced alkaline diuresis, sodium bicarbonate is added to the infusion fluid to make blood and, in turn, urine alkaline. Potassium replacement becomes of utmost importance in this setting because potassium is usually lost in urine.
