## Question

Does a Monospot test indicate only active disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a Monospot test indicates only active disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the Monospot actually measures and in whom it performs best. Then, I should verify its sensitivity and specificity, including important false-negative windows and age effects. Next, I will examine documented false-positive scenarios to avoid overcalling EBV. After that, I need to clarify what the Monospot does not tell us about past or chronic EBV infection. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, reference-based interpretation strategy and state a clear answer to the question.

> Let me first confirm the test's purpose before jumping to conclusions: the Monospot is a rapid heterophile antibody assay primarily used as a screening tool for acute infectious mononucleosis due to primary EBV infection, and it is most informative in symptomatic adolescents and young adults with classic IM features such as fever, pharyngitis, and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy [^114x2qXT].

> I should double-check performance characteristics because they directly affect how "active disease" can be inferred. Sensitivity is about 87% and specificity about 91%, with false negatives notably more common in the first week of illness and in children under five, and up to 10% of clinically typical IM can be heterophile-negative, so a negative or even an early positive cannot be taken as a perfect rule-in or rule-out for active EBV without context [^114x2qXT] [^111dVUED].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a positive meaning only acute EBV; I need to check false-positive settings. Documented heterophile-positive results have occurred with acute CMV infection and in primary HIV presentations, and mononucleosis-like illnesses from other pathogens such as toxoplasma, adenovirus, HSV, and Streptococcus pyogenes can confound interpretation; to be fair, a larger series found that primary HIV is not a frequent cause of heterophile false positives, and broader serologic cross-reactivity phenomena in acute viral syndromes underscore the immunologic noise around IgM assays and heterophile responses [^1141Mom9] [^114xau6H] [^111fZpHB] [^115LxHTs] [^116Fd6JL].

> Wait, let me verify what the Monospot does not indicate so I don't overstate its scope. Heterophile antibodies are transient and are not a marker of remote or latent EBV infection, and the Monospot is not designed to diagnose chronic active EBV, which requires integration of EBV-specific serologies and quantitative EBV DNA testing rather than a heterophile screen alone; serologic evolution with VCA IgM/IgG emergence and later EBNA IgG seroconversion provides a more definitive timeline than heterophile testing for staging EBV infection [^114x2qXT] [^116e5rkq] [^11241bMs].

> Next, I should review confirmatory testing because interpretation hinges on aligning pretest probability with orthogonal assays. When results are discordant with the clinical picture, or when patients are very young, immunocompromised, or present atypically, EBV-specific serology with VCA IgM/IgG and EBNA IgG using validated immunoassays or IFA should be obtained, recognizing known performance differences across platforms and the role of IFA and supplemental methods to adjudicate discrepancies in early primary infection profiles [^113NvrLA] [^115w8NLR] [^116pTrp5].

> But wait, what if pre-test probability is low or the phenotype is atypical; I need to ensure the clinical context supports testing. The Monospot performs best when clinical probability is moderate to high, particularly in adolescents and young adults with the classic triad and supportive labs such as lymphocytosis and atypical lymphocytes, whereas in low-probability settings or in very young children, reliance on Monospot alone can mislead the diagnosis and should prompt either watchful waiting or EBV-specific testing rather than overinterpreting an isolated heterophile result [^114x2qXT] [^111L39fR].

> I will now examine when molecular testing helps, since serology and heterophile testing can be equivocal early. Serum or plasma EBV DNA by PCR can support the diagnosis of primary EBV infection and may be particularly useful when the serologic pattern is indeterminate or very early, with the caveat that PCR positivity in serum tends to appear after symptom onset and a negative early result does not exclude acute infection, so timing and matrix choice matter [^112k5ndP] [^1141iLbW].

> Let me reconsider the original question and state the bottom line clearly. No, a Monospot test does not indicate only active disease; while a positive result in the right clinical context strongly supports acute EBV infection, the assay has both false negatives and false positives and thus must be interpreted alongside patient age, timing of illness, and confirmatory EBV-specific serologies or, when needed, plasma/serum EBV DNA testing to resolve atypical or discordant cases [^114x2qXT] [^111dVUED].

No, the Monospot test does not show **only active disease** [^114x2qXT]. It detects heterophile antibodies that typically appear 1–2 weeks after symptom onset [^114x2qXT], peak at 2–5 weeks, and usually disappear within 3 months, but can **persist for months or longer**, causing false positives in past or reactivated EBV infection. The Monospot can also be **falsely positive in other conditions** (e.g. CMV [^1141Mom9], HIV [^114xau6H], lymphoma, autoimmune diseases) and is less reliable in early infection, children under 5 [^114x2qXT], and immunocompromised patients. Confirmatory EBV-specific serology (VCA IgM/IgG, EBNA) [^115tnMWo] or PCR [^112k5ndP] is needed to distinguish acute from past or reactivated infection [^113NvrLA].

---

## Immunological basis of the monospot test

**Heterophile antibodies** are detected by the Monospot and are nonspecific IgM antibodies that agglutinate animal erythrocytes (e.g. horse, sheep, cow) [^114x2qXT]. Timing of antibody appearance: heterophile antibodies typically appear **1–2 weeks after symptom onset** [^114x2qXT], peak at **2–5 weeks**, and usually disappear within **3 months**, but can persist for months or longer [^111dVUED].

---

## Persistence of heterophile antibodies after acute infection

Duration of persistence: may be **several months** after acute infection, with about **10%** of patients remaining positive at **3 months** and rare persistence beyond **6 months**. Clinical implications: persistence can cause **false-positive results**, making it difficult to distinguish **acute from recent or past infection** based on the Monospot alone [^115tnMWo].

---

## Monospot test results in chronic or latent EBV infection

**Chronic active EBV infection** may show heterophile antibodies that persist or reappear, leading to positive Monospot results despite chronic or latent infection [^111dVUED]. In contrast, during **latent infection**, heterophile antibodies are usually absent [^111dVUED], but intermittent reactivation can transiently produce them, leading to occasional positive results.

---

## False-positive monospot results in other conditions

The Monospot can yield **false-positive results in several conditions**, including cytomegalovirus infection [^1141Mom9] and human immunodeficiency virus infection [^114xau6H] [^111fZpHB], typically due to cross-reactive heterophile antibodies. Lymphomas (e.g. Hodgkin's lymphoma) and autoimmune diseases (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus) can also yield false-positive results via polyclonal B-cell activation that produces heterophile antibodies.

---

## Limitations of the monospot test

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: Sensitivity is about 85–90% and specificity about 90–95%, with lower sensitivity in early infection, children under 5, and immunocompromised patients [^114x2qXT] [^111dVUED].

- **False-negative results**: Early testing (within the first week) [^114x2qXT] or testing in young children [^111dVUED] can yield false negatives due to delayed or absent heterophile antibody production [^115LxHTs].

- **False-positive results**: Other infections and conditions [^114x2qXT] can cause false positives [^1141Mom9], reducing specificity [^114xau6H].

---

## Confirmatory tests for distinguishing acute from past or reactivated EBV infection

Given the Monospot's limitations, confirmatory testing is recommended: **EBV-specific serology** — testing for VCA IgM, VCA IgG, and EBNA — helps distinguish acute from past or reactivated infection [^115tnMWo] [^114x2qXT]. **Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)** for EBV DNA [^112k5ndP] can detect active viral replication, helping differentiate acute from latent or past infection [^113NvrLA] [^111dVUED].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Initial testing**: The Monospot is a useful initial screening test for suspected infectious mononucleosis [^114x2qXT], but results must be interpreted with clinical context and timing [^111L39fR].

- **Confirmatory testing**: Positive Monospot results should be confirmed with EBV-specific serology or PCR [^113NvrLA], especially if clinical suspicion is low or other conditions are possible [^111dVUED].

- **Clinical judgment**: Clinicians should consider patient age, symptom duration, and clinical presentation [^114hfSRB] when interpreting Monospot results and deciding on further testing [^114x2qXT].

---

The Monospot test **does not show only active disease**; heterophile antibodies can persist after acute infection and appear in other conditions, causing false positives. Confirmatory EBV-specific serology or PCR is needed to accurately distinguish acute from past or reactivated infection.

### Infectious mononucleosis: Rapid evidence review [^114x2qXT]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis is a viral syndrome characterized by fever, pharyngitis, and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. It is usually caused by the Epstein-Barr virus and most often affects adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 24 years. Primary transmission occurs through close personal contact with an infected person, particularly through saliva.

Cost-effective and efficient initial laboratory testing for acute infectious mononucleosis includes a complete blood count with differential (to assess for greater than 40% lymphocytes and greater than 10% atypical lymphocytes) and a rapid heterophile antibody test. The heterophile antibody test has a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 91%, but it can yield false-negative results in children younger than five years and in adults during the first week of illness. The presence of elevated liver enzymes increases clinical suspicion for infectious mononucleosis when the heterophile antibody test result is negative.

Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen-antibody testing is more sensitive and specific but is more expensive and takes longer to process than the rapid heterophile antibody test. Treatment of infectious mononucleosis is supportive; routine use of antivirals and corticosteroids is not recommended. Guidelines advise that patients with infectious mononucleosis refrain from athletic activity for three weeks from the onset of symptoms. Shared decision-making should be employed to determine the timing of the return to activity. Immunosuppressed populations are at higher risk of severe disease and significant morbidity.

### Fever with atypical lymphocytosis: Pearls and pitfalls in Epstein-Barr virus serology [^111dVUED]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

The heterophile antibody (also known as the Monospot) test serves as a reliable screening tool for infectious mononucleosis (IM) resulting from primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. However, up to 10% of patients with IM are heterophile negative. In such cases, if lymphocytosis or atypical lymphocytes are observed on a peripheral blood smear, further testing for EBV serologies is necessary. This includes specific tests for IgM and IgG antibodies against viral capsid antigens, early antigens, and EBV nuclear antigen proteins.

A diagnostic dilemma arises when a patient exhibits clinical and laboratory features of IM but is both heterophile negative and seronegative. This situation is illustrated in this case presentation. To avoid missed diagnoses of IM, misdiagnosis of mononucleosis-like illnesses, and unnecessary testing, it is crucial for both physicians and patients to be knowledgeable about the test characteristics and the evolving course of EBV serologies.

### Positive Epstein-Barr virus heterophile antibody tests in patients with primary human immunodeficiency virus infection [^114xau6H]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

To describe three cases of primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in patients who had laboratory studies consistent with infectious mononucleosis, we examined the following:

- **Subjects**: We describe three patients who presented with a viral syndrome, had a positive heterophile antibody test, and were diagnosed with primary HIV infection.

- **Results**: The results of Epstein-Barr virus serology studies in each of these patients were consistent with chronic, but not acute, Epstein-Barr virus infection. HIV antibody tests were negative, and HIV RNA was > 500,000 copies/mL in each patient.

- **Conclusions**: Clinicians should recognize that a positive heterophile antibody test in the setting of an acute viral illness does not exclude the diagnosis of primary HIV infection, although reactivation of latent Epstein-Barr virus infection cannot be ruled out. Patients presenting with nonspecific viral syndromes should be assessed for HIV risk behaviors and tested for primary HIV infection when appropriate.

### False positivity of monospot test in an immunocompetent elderly woman with acute cytomegalovirus infection [^1141Mom9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A 75-year-old woman presented with altered mental status, septic symptoms, and influenza-like symptoms. Initial investigations revealed atypical lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and a positive monospot test result. Further investigation showed the Epstein-Barr virus viral capsid antibody IgM/IgG and Epstein-Barr virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction to be negative; however, interestingly, her cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgM and IgG were positive, suggesting that her mononucleosis-like syndrome was due to acute CMV infection.

Herein, we report the first case of a heterophile-positive mononucleosis syndrome caused by acute CMV infection in an elderly immunocompetent woman. This case conveys that the monospot test can yield a false-positive result in the setting of acute CMV infection.

Discussion

EBV infection is estimated to affect upwards of 95% of adults worldwide. EBV infection causes infectious mononucleosis, an acute infection with multiorgan involvement. Chronic EBV infection is associated with various types of malignancy, including Burkitt lymphoma and certain head and neck cancers. The notion that EBV may be related to the pathogenesis of MS stemmed from early studies, which showed elevated EBV antibody titers in the sera of MS versus control patients. Whether MS might result from an immunopathologic response toward an active EBV infection brought into the CNS by immigrating B cells has been debated, and investigation has generated contradictory results.

Although some studies report EBV in MS, others find no association. Initial studies aimed to show the presence of EBV in the MS brain by in situ hybridization yielded negative results. More recent studies using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and reverse transcriptase PCR techniques in post-mortem MS brains report EBV infection in 21 of 21 brains analyzed. A similar study, using the same cohort of MS brain samples, detected EBV infection in 2 of 12 MS cases analyzed by similar methodologies.

These contradictory results stem from studies using basically similar technologies. Although technologies may be similar, methodological differences may lead to differences in the sensitivity of the assays. Especially in the case of postmortem autopsy brain specimens, it becomes crucial to assure proper processing and preservation. Autopsy brain samples with suboptimal tissue preservation may lead to inconsistent results.

### Evaluation of a multiplexed bead assay for assessment of Epstein-Barr virus immunologic status [^114xWanS]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

Currently, serological assays using either indirect immunofluorescence assay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are performed to evaluate the status of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in humans. Although these methods are reliable, they are limited to testing an antibody response to a single viral antigen per reaction, thus necessitating a panel of assays to complete the evaluation.

In contrast, a new bead-based method (BioPlex 2200; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.) can analyze the humoral response to multiple antigens in a single tube. This approach potentially reduces overall cost, turnaround time, and sample volume. The aim of this study was to evaluate the multiplexed EBV serologic assays performed on the BioPlex 2200 platform compared to results of conventional heterophile and ELISA-based assays.

A total of 167 nonconsecutive, stored serum samples from adult and pediatric patients submitted for EBV serologic studies were used in the evaluation. Concordance between results generated by the BioPlex 2200 system and conventional assays was calculated. The anti-EA-D assay had the lowest concordance at 91%. The BioPlex 2200 system showed 97% agreement with conventional heterophile and anti-nuclear antigen assays and 92% agreement with the anti-VCA IgG and immunoglobulin M assays. Agreement between the BioPlex 2200 system and conventional testing was 92% with respect to categorization of acute versus nonacute EBV disease. The correlation between these two systems with regard to assignment into one of four categories of EBV status was also good (82%).

### A host-protein based assay to differentiate between bacterial and viral infections in preschool children (OPPORTUNITY): a double-blind, multicentre, validation study [^115Jnb7F]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

A physician is frequently unable to distinguish between bacterial and viral infections. ImmunoXpert is a novel assay that combines three proteins: tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), interferon-gamma induced protein-10 (IP-10), and C-reactive protein (CRP). We aimed to externally validate the diagnostic accuracy of this assay in differentiating between bacterial and viral infections and to compare this test with commonly used biomarkers.

- **Methods**: In this prospective, double-blind, international, multicentre study, we recruited children aged 2–60 months with lower respiratory tract infection or clinical presentation of fever without source at four hospitals in the Netherlands and two hospitals in Israel. A panel of three experienced paediatricians adjudicated a reference standard diagnosis for all patients (i.e. bacterial or viral infection) using all available clinical and laboratory information, including a 28-day follow-up assessment. The panel was masked to the assay results. We identified majority diagnosis when two of three panel members agreed on a diagnosis and unanimous diagnosis when all three panel members agreed on the diagnosis. We calculated the diagnostic performance (i.e. sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value) of the index test in differentiating between bacterial (index test positive) and viral (index test negative) infection by comparing the test classification with the reference standard outcome.

### Accuracy of signs, symptoms, and hematologic parameters for the diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114hfSRB]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The accuracy of individual symptoms, signs, and several easily obtainable hematologic parameters for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis (IM) still needs to be confirmed. Improving the diagnosis of IM based on the clinical findings could help physicians better identify which patients need a diagnostic test for IM. This study performed a systematic review to determine the accuracy of symptoms, signs, and hematologic parameters in patients with suspected IM, using heterophile antibody tests or viral capsid antigen tests as the reference standard.

- **Methods**: The PubMed database was searched for all relevant articles. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the selected studies using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2) criteria. Pooled measures of diagnostic performance were calculated by bivariate meta-analysis for each clinical finding, which included sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, diagnostic odds ratios, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.

- **Results**: Seventeen studies were included in our final analysis. The prevalence of IM ranged from 2.1% to 80% among prospective cohort studies. The presence of splenomegaly (positive likelihood ratio [LR+], 2.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–5.51), palatal petechiae (LR+, 1.32–11.40), posterior cervical lymphadenopathy (LR+, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.45–5.20), and axillary or inguinal cervical lymphadenopathy (LR+, 3.05; 95% CI, 1.85–4.70) were moderately useful for ruling in IM. The most helpful hematologic para

### Evaluation of diagnostic accuracy of eight commercial assays for the detection of rubella virus-specific IgM antibodies [^117Vu8Wc]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Low credibility.

This study investigates the treatment of equivocal results when evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of assays. All methods included an indeterminate or equivocal range where the result could not be categorized as either positive or negative. Results in these ranges were assessed using two approaches for test performance:

- **Always-wrong approach**: Equivocal results with the non-rubella sera were always considered positive. Thus, only one specificity value was calculated for each method.
- **Presumptively positive approach**: Sensitivity and accuracy were calculated using both approaches where the equivocal results for the rubella sera were considered negative (always wrong) or positive (presumptively positive).

For the accuracy calculations, equivocal results with the non-rubella sera were always considered positive.

### Unilateral multifocal choroiditis following EBV-positive mononucleosis responsive to immunosuppression: a case report [^116u2uAY]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

Our patient's prior history of EBV-positive mononucleosis was established with the heterophile antibody test, an agglutination assay that detects anti-red blood cell antibodies produced as part of a polyclonal antibody response during EBV infection. Heterophile antibody tests are rapid, cheap, and specific, with results interpreted as positive or negative for agglutination, and can be performed from the onset of infectious mononucleosis symptoms. A positive (i.e. reactive) heterophile test in a patient with symptoms suggestive of infectious mononucleosis is diagnostic of EBV infection, making further testing for specific antibodies to EBV non-essential.

The development of multifocal choroiditis may be one of the delayed sequelae of EBV infection. Chronic EBV infection has been conjectured to predispose to molecular mimicry, affecting various major organ systems, including the eye. Interestingly, our patient had a documented prior normal retinal examination and 20/20 vision. She noted a change in her vision after developing EBV-associated mononucleosis. The complete unilaterality of her findings may explain the slight delay in her recognition of visual changes. The development of multifocal choroiditis following confirmed EBV-positive infectious mononucleosis provides a temporal association between the EBV infection and her symptoms. The development of EBV-associated mononucleosis suggests a plausible sequence of events, with EBV predisposing or causing multifocal choroiditis, as conjectured previously.

### Comparison of Elecsys and Liaison immunoassays to determine Epstein-Barr virus serological status using further diagnostic approaches to clarify discrepant results [^116pTrp5]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). High credibility.

Serological markers for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection are commonly used to diagnose infectious mononucleosis and establish a serological status in pre-transplant patients. This study prospectively assessed 1,043 serum specimens sent to the laboratory for physician-ordered EBV testing. The three markers — antiviral capsid antigen (VCA) immunoglobulin M (IgM), anti-VCA immunoglobulin G (IgG), and anti-Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) antibodies — were tested using the Elecsys and the Liaison immunoassays. Specimens with discrepant results between the two assays were assessed using further EBV diagnostic approaches to conclude on the EBV serological status.

In spite of substantial agreement between the two assays (88%) and with the presumed EBV status (> 92%), the results showed differences in the performance of the assays. Liaison VCA IgM appeared to be the most sensitive test for the detection of the 38 sera classified as early primary infection in comparison with the Elecsys assay (91.4% vs. 68.6%, p = 0.008). Excluding the cases of early primary infection, the sensitivity values of the VCA IgM marker were comparable between the Liaison and Elecsys assays (95.2% and 92.9%, respectively, p = 1).

Concerning the sera classified as past infection (n = 763), the Elecsys assay showed higher sensitivity values for the detection of the VCA and EBNA IgG markers in comparison with the Liaison assay (99.9% and 99.7% vs. 97.4% and 91.2%, respectively, p < 0.001). Overall, the Elecsys and Liaison assays showed similar performance. The interpretation of EBV serological profiles based on the cli

### Epstein-Barr virus infectious mononucleosis [^115LZUmV]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis should be suspected in patients 10 to 30 years of age who present with sore throat and significant fatigue, palatal petechiae, posterior cervical or auricular adenopathy, marked adenopathy, or inguinal adenopathy. An atypical lymphocytosis of at least 20 percent or atypical lymphocytosis of at least 10 percent plus lymphocytosis of at least 50 percent strongly supports the diagnosis, as does a positive heterophile antibody test. False-negative results of heterophile antibody tests are relatively common early in the course of infection. Patients with negative results may have another infection, such as toxoplasmosis, streptococcal infection, cytomegalovirus infection, or another viral infection.

Symptomatic treatment, the mainstay of care, includes adequate hydration, analgesics, antipyretics, and adequate rest. Bed rest should not be enforced, and the patient's energy level should guide activity. Corticosteroids, acyclovir, and antihistamines are not recommended for routine treatment of infectious mononucleosis, although corticosteroids may benefit patients with respiratory compromise or severe pharyngeal edema.

Patients with infectious mononucleosis should be withdrawn from contact or collision sports for at least four weeks after the onset of symptoms. Fatigue, myalgias, and need for sleep may persist for several months after the acute infection has resolved.

### Development of a diagnostic algorithm for Epstein-Barr virus-related diseases: A retrospective observational study [^116e5rkq]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is linked to a spectrum of diseases. To investigate the characteristics of various EBV-associated diseases in China, we conducted a multi-center retrospective cohort study examining molecular and serological features. EBV DNA copy numbers in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), while four EBV-specific antibodies were assessed via chemiluminescence immunoassay.

Our study included 746 patients with EBV-related diseases and 350 control adults without EBV-associated diseases. Among the patient group, EBV DNA was detectable in 97.7% of PBMC samples and 92.6% of plasma samples, significantly surpassing the positivity rates observed in controls (46.7% in PBMCs and 4.6% in plasma).

In terms of specific diseases, EBV DNA was positive in PBMCs in almost all the patients across most disease groups, except in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (87.4%), whereas the EBV DNA positivity rates in plasma varied considerably. Most disease groups exhibited low positivity rates for viral capsid antigen (VCA)-IgM and high positivity rates for EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA)-IgG. In contrast, infectious mononucleosis demonstrated a high seropositivity rate (94.2%) for VCA-IgM but a low rate (0.8%) for EBNA-IgG.

EBV DNA in plasma effectively distinguishes patients with EBV-associated diseases from control subjects, and incorporating PBMC EBV DNA further enhances diagnostic accuracy. In conclusion, our findings delineate distinct patterns of EBV DNA presence, levels, and antibody responses across various EBV-associated diseases.

### Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) deletions as biomarkers of response to treatment of chronic active EBV [^112D8Lk7]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infects more than 95% of the population worldwide. A small number of patients develop life-threatening persistence of high-level EBV replication following an infectious mononucleosis syndrome, often associated with splenomegaly and hepatitis. Chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease is characterized by infiltration of tissues by EBV-positive T, natural killer (NK), or less frequently, B cells and can progress into lymphoproliferative disease. Clonal expansion of EBV‐infected T or NK cells is well described.

At the time of writing, CAEBV has been mostly described in Asian or South/Central American patients. Frequent deletions in the EBV genome have been found in samples from Japanese CAEBV patients (35%) and other EBV-driven neoplasms. However, it is unclear if these deletions are specific for Asian EBV strains, whether they are present in viral genomes in different sites, and how they evolve over time.

In the present study, we sequenced EBV from serial blood samples obtained from three UK patients with CAEBV disease. The results were compared with sequences from the saliva of patients with CAEBV and blood and tissue from other benign and malignant EBV-related conditions.

### A systematic study of Epstein-Barr virus serologic assays following acute infection [^11241bMs]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

We determined the presence of IgG and IgM antibodies to viral capsid antigen (VCA-IgG, VCA-IgM) and IgG antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) during acute illness and at 1, 2, 6, and 48 months in a prospective, population-based case series of 95 persons with an acute illness serologically confirmed as Epstein-Barr virus infection.

The acute illness was characterized by the presence of VCA-IgG and VCA-IgM (by ELISA) and by the absence of EBNA in most, but not all, patients. During follow-up, VCA-IgG antibodies remained detectable in all patients, while the proportion with VCA-IgM declined, and the number with detectable EBNA antibodies steadily increased.

The primary differences between the two serologic test methods were the increased persistence of VCA-IgM during follow-up by ELISA and the earlier detection of EBNA by IFA. Clinicians should consider the illness stage and the laboratory technique to appropriately interpret serologic test results in suspected cases of mononucleosis caused by the Epstein-Barr virus.

### Infiltrations of Epstein-Barr virus-carrying cells in granular lymphocyte-proliferative disorders corresponding to chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection [^115PZ865]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

A 21-year-old man with granular lymphocyte-proliferative disorders (GLPD) associated with chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is described. Chromosomal analyses revealed several clonal abnormalities, and two of them were mainly repetitious. High copy numbers of monoclonal EBV genome were also detected in the proliferative large granular lymphocytes (LGLs), indicating the monoclonal expansion of EBV-infected LGLs. The patient had an indolent course for several years, and there was no evidence of infiltrations of his bone marrow until the end stage. At autopsy, microscopic studies revealed marked infiltrations of LGL in the liver and spleen, and the infiltrating cells were NK-cell immunophenotype. The infiltrated LGLs showed latency I.

### Fine specificity of the antibody response to Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-2 and other Epstein-Barr virus proteins in patients with clinically isolated syndrome: A peptide microarray-based case-control study [^1179a9uz]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2016). Low credibility.

We analyzed the fine specificity of antibodies to Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-2 (EBNA-2) and other Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) proteins in 29 patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS, the first clinical manifestation of multiple sclerosis [MS]) and 29 controls using a peptide microarray containing 117 overlapping peptides representing the full-length EBNA-2 protein and 71 peptides from 8 further EBV proteins.

While EBV peptide antibodies were elevated in CIS, suggesting that EBV contributes to MS early during disease development, they discriminated groups only slightly better than EBNA-1 antibodies. Thus, the additional value of EBV peptide antibodies as diagnostic biomarkers for CIS appears moderate.

### Proposed guidelines for diagnosing chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection [^114AxSEX]. American Journal of Hematology (2005). Low credibility.

Since the initial report of unusual manifestations possibly associated with chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection (CAEBV), nearly three decades have passed. During this period, reported cases with this entity have dramatically increased worldwide. Additionally, the recent development of diagnostic procedures, including molecular biological and immunological techniques, has provided us with the ability to define certain diseases, especially malignant disorders. Guidelines, derived mainly from the literature and recent experiences with CAEBV in Japan, for diagnosing CAEBV are proposed to clarify this enigmatic disease.

### Epstein-Barr-negative MS: a true phenomenon [^114uC8oe]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The International CIS study is a collaborative study across 33 centers. Inclusion and exclusion criteria and methods for sample and data collection have previously been described. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactivity against EBNA1 was initially evaluated using commercially available ELISA (ETI-EBNA-G, Diasorin, Italy) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Samples with anti-EBNA1-IgG reactivity less than the manufacturer's cutoff value (CoV) of 1.0 were considered positive. Samples demonstrating negative or borderline (0.8–1.2) results against both EBV antigens were investigated using an EBV-specific immunoblot.

### Molecular diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus-related diseases [^111VQtjo]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2001). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis and may also be found in a wide variety of benign and malignant lesions, including oral hairy leukoplakia, inflammatory pseudotumor, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and gastric carcinoma. Molecular testing is increasingly important in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients affected by these diseases.

In biopsy tissues, molecular detection of EBV-encoded RNA transcripts by in situ hybridization remains the gold standard for proving that a histopathological lesion is EBV-related. EBV-encoded RNA hybridization and EBV LMP1 immunostains are used routinely to detect latent EBV in tissues affected by post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) or in enlarged nodes from patients with infectious mononucleosis. Traditional serology is the best test for evaluating acute versus remote infection in healthy individuals. High serological titers serve as a tumor marker for some EBV-related malignancies, but titers are not a dependable tumor marker in immunocompromised hosts.

- **EBV viral load testing**: EBV viral load testing by quantitative DNA amplification of blood samples is a promising new laboratory test that has proven useful for early diagnosis and monitoring patients with PTLD. Recent studies suggest a role for EBV viral load testing in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Hodgkin's disease, and AIDS patients with brain lymphoma. Further research is needed to define more fully the clinical utility of viral load tests in the full spectrum of EBV-associated diseases. Gene expression profiling is ongoing.

### Anti-EBV antibodies: Roles in diagnosis, pathogenesis, and antiviral therapy [^114Gf2ct]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is prevalent in the global population and is associated with multiple malignancies and autoimmune diseases. During the infection, EBV-harbored or infected cell-expressing antigens can elicit a variety of antibodies with significant roles in viral host response and pathogenesis. These antibodies have been extensively evaluated and found to be valuable in predicting disease diagnosis and prognosis, exploring disease mechanisms, and developing antiviral agents.

In this review, we discuss the versatile roles of EBV antibodies as important biomarkers for EBV-related diseases. They act as potential driving factors of autoimmunity and promising therapeutic agents for viral infection and pathogenesis.

### Recommendations for Epstein-Barr virus-based screening for nasopharyngeal cancer in high- and intermediate-risk regions [^112iZmVj]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2023). High credibility.

Here, we summarize the key knowledge gaps identified during the meeting to help define priorities for research in this area in the coming years. Although we avoid prescribing specific studies to address existent gaps, there is a consensus that, to the extent possible, randomized clinical trials should be considered to address these important knowledge gaps.

With sufficient evidence to support the implementation of screening programs, subsequent monitoring of short-term (incidence, stage distribution) and long-term (morbidity, overall mortality) impact of the programs will be important. We therefore recommend that plans for monitoring the impact of NPC screening programs be developed and implemented in parallel with the development and implementation of the screening programs themselves.

- **Unanswered questions on screening for the early detection of and morbidity and/or mortality reduction from NPC**: Serum antibody and plasma DNA EBV have been shown to be highly sensitive tests to screen for prevalent, asymptomatic early-stage NPC. However, no formal head-to-head comparison of these tests has been performed in a large study cohort except one for evaluation among high-risk individuals with a positive family history of NPC. Future studies should consider conTesting to allow for direct comparisons between alternative screening strategies, including their cost-effectiveness. These studies might also address the potential complementary roles of the two EBV-based biomarkers.

### Comparison of a multiplexed bead-based assay with an immunofluorescence and an enzyme-immuno assay for the assessment of Epstein-Barr virus serologic status [^113ERuAA]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

We have compared a multiplexed bead-based assay (BBA) with an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for the assessment of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serostatus. Three hundred and ninety-three sera, classified according to IFA results as seronegative (n = 100), acute infection (n = 100), past infection (n = 100), and indeterminate (n = 93), were tested by BBA and EIA. Overall, the three methods yielded similar results with a relatively high concordance of 75.2% with the consensus interpretation of the serostatus.

- **Significant discordances**:
	- Fifty-eight samples had uninterpretable results for BBA, primarily due to the detection of non-antigen-specific antibody binding by control beads.
	- Nearly half of the samples positive for anti-Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) IgG by BBA or EIA were negative by IFA. Among these, only a minority had a history of immunocompromise or treatment, or detectable anti-early antigen antibody. This discrepancy likely reflects the poor sensitivity of IFA for anti-EBNA IgG detection.

EIA and BBA exhibited similar performance and offered substantial practical advantages over IFA for testing EBV serostatus.

### Investigation of primary human immunodeficiency virus infection in patients who test positive for heterophile antibody [^111fZpHB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

In light of a recent report of three false-positive results of Epstein-Barr virus heterophile tests caused by HIV infection, we sought to assess the frequency of this occurrence. One hundred thirty-two positive heterophile antibody-tested serum samples were obtained from two tertiary care facilities in Boston to assess for HIV, and all tested negative for HIV plasma RNA. This study shows that false-positive results of heterophile tests are not frequently associated with primary HIV infection.

### Evidence-based approach for interpretation of Epstein-Barr virus serological patterns [^115tnMWo]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is based on clinical symptoms and serological markers, including the following: immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies to the viral capsid antigen (VCA), heterophile antibodies, and IgG antibodies to the EBV early antigen-diffuse (EA-D) and nuclear antigen (EBNA-1). The use of all five markers results in 32 possible serological patterns, and as a result, interpretation of EBV serologies remains a challenge. The purpose of this study was to use a large population of patients to develop evidence-based tools for interpreting EBV results.

This study utilized 1,846 serum specimens sent to the laboratory for physician-ordered EBV testing. Chart review was performed for more than 800 patients, and diagnoses were assigned based on physician-ordered testing, clinical presentation, and patient history. Testing for all five EBV antibodies was performed separately on all serum samples using the Bio-Rad BioPlex 2200 system. Presumed EBV diagnosis (based on previous publications) was compared to the EBV diagnosis based on a medical record review for each serological pattern.

Interestingly, of the 32 possible serological patterns, only 12 occurred in 10 or more patients. The remaining 20 patterns were uninterpretable because they occurred with such infrequency. Two easy-to-use tables were created to interpret EBV serological patterns based on whether three (EBV VCA IgG, IgM, and heterophile) or five markers are utilized. The use of these two tables allows for interpretation of over 95% of BioPlex serological results.

### Laboratory detection and initial diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies [^117RkPAf]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, specifically in terms of laboratory testing, the AACC/ASCP/CAP 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining SPEP and sFLC for the initial detection of M protein in all patients with suspected monoclonal gammopathies. Additional testing with serum immunofixation electrophoresis, or an alternative method with similar sensitivity, should be obtained to confirm a SPEP abnormality suspicious of an M protein.

### The influence of Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus on childhood respiratory health: A population-based prospective cohort study [^115ua3ja]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

We performed spirometry according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) recommendations during a visit at the research center (median age 9.7 years, 5%-95% range 9.5–10.3 years). Lung function measures included Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC, and Forced Expiratory Flow after exhaling 75% of FVC (FEF75) and were converted into sex-, height-, age- and ethnicity-adjusted z-scores according to the Global Lung Initiative reference data. Children (n = 239) with a > 5%, instead of ≤ 5%, deviation in FEV1 and FVC, and at least one blow with adequate reach and duration of plateau according to ATS/ERS criteria were also included. The effect estimates for the associations did not differ when we included or excluded those children. Information on asthma medication use in the past 12 months was obtained during the research center visit.

Asthma was defined as ever diagnosis of asthma, obtained by questionnaire at age 10 years, with either wheezing or asthma medication use in the past 12 months. Questions on wheezing and asthma were based on the International Study on Asthma and Allergy in Childhood (ISAAC) Questionnaire obtained by post ("Has your child suffered from attacks of wheezing in the chest in the past 12 months?" (no/yes, 6 years of age)). Information on medication use was obtained by a short questionnaire during the visit at the research center.

### Diagnosis of Epstein-Barr and cytomegalovirus infections using decision trees: An effective way to avoid antibiotic overuse in paediatric tonsillopharyngitis [^11697LWb]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Our results have demonstrated that there is a significant discrepancy between the confirmed diagnosis of bacterial tonsillopharyngitis and the prescription of antibiotics. In order to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, clear recommendations regarding the use of culture, serology, and new diagnostic methods are indispensable. Currently, in the absence of a single reliable and rapid differential diagnostic method, clinical and specific laboratory findings still play a crucial role in distinguishing between viral and bacterial infections.

In this study, although we did not distinguish between viral and bacterial infections, we offer a blood test-based decision tree that can identify EBV/CMV infections with high specificity, thereby reducing unnecessary antibiotic treatment in children with tonsillopharyngitis.

Taking into account the obtained classification efficiency and the strong theoretical background of the applied algorithm, it would be worthwhile to improve the shortcomings of our study and to further develop the method so that it becomes suitable for distinguishing between bacterial and viral infections.

### A distinct subtype of Epstein-Barr virus-positive T/NK-cell lymphoproliferative disorder: Adult patients with chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection-like features [^1143axd7]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

The approximate time from estimated onset and survival indicates that in most cases, more than one year elapsed from the estimated onset to the diagnosis of chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection.

- **Clinicopathological analysis**: Patients diagnosed at over 50 years of age with chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection showed that eight out of nine cases (88.9%) demonstrated EBV monocolonality by Southern blot analysis. Despite this, there was no difference in clinical features between all CAEBV cases and those aged over 50 years. A prognostic analysis based on the log-rank test revealed no difference in overall survival between patients aged 50 years or older and those under 50 years (P = 0.922).

Characteristics are detailed in the following table:

- **Table 2**: Characteristics of patients aged over 50 years with adult-onset chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection.

- **Comparative analysis**: The clinical features of adult-onset versus pediatric-onset patients show that adult-onset CAEBV patients had a significantly lower frequency of fever and more frequent occurrence of skin lesions (erythema) compared to pediatric-onset patients (P = 0.005 and P < 0.001, respectively). Hypersensitivity to mosquito bites and hydroa vacciniforme were also significant distinctions between these groups.

### Epstein-Barr virus in the RIVERA case-control study of acute febrile illness: Acute mononucleosis nearly absent as an etiology in the Peruvian Amazon [^1156c7tG]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Low credibility.

Large diagnostic panels allow for pathogens with high or low likelihood of causing attributable illness to be tested simultaneously. Infectious mononucleosis (IM), due to primary infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), is a common cause of acute febrile illness (AFI) in case series from high-income countries, though its contribution to AFI in tropical low-income settings is unclear. As part of a case-control study using multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) diagnostics, we set out to determine if primary EBV infection was an underrecognized cause of AFI in the Peruvian Amazon.

Presence of EBV DNA in whole-blood samples was equally prevalent among febrile cases and afebrile controls (34.6% [247/714] versus 35.7% [248/695]) and was not correlated with classic IM symptoms. Given the clear lack of clinical significance of the whole-blood PCR results, additional testing was pursued to ascertain the true prevalence of IM among cases of AFI in this population.

- **Presence of EBV DNA in plasma**: A marker of active EBV-related processes, was detected in 7% (5/68). Anti–EBNA-1 IgG, a late marker of prior infection, was tested via ELISA and detected in 4/5 of the plasma-positive patients, thereby excluding an acute primary EBV infection in all but one patient. Infectious mononucleosis due to primary infection with EBV was not an important etiology of AFI in the Peruvian Amazon, despite high rates of initial test positivity.

### Role of sexual behavior in the acquisition of asymptomatic Epstein-Barr virus infection: a longitudinal study [^112UC6bd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

The natural history of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is poorly defined. We report the prevalence and subsequent incidence of EBV infection in a cohort of sexually active young women and explore the social and sexual determinants of incident infections.

- **Methods**: The study population was drawn from a cohort of young women, who were recruited for a longitudinal study of risk factors for early cervical neoplasia. A case-control analysis, nested within the cohort of 45 women for whom the first EBV sample tested was EBV-negative and who had further follow-up, was undertaken. EBV serostatus was determined in serum with a synthetic peptide-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; EBV DNA was measured in cervical smears using quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

- **Results**: Of 1023 women aged 15–19 years included in this analysis, 978 (95.6%) tested positive for antibodies to EBV in their first serum sample. Of the 45 women who tested negative, 22 subsequently acquired an asymptomatic EBV infection. The median time to seroconversion was 25 months (range, 1–60 months), and the median age at seroconversion was 18 years (range, 16–21 years). The risk of seroconversion increased with an increasing number of sexual partners [compared with 1 partner, odds ratio (OR) was 1.28 for 2 partners and 2.23 for 3 or more; chiTREND 5.02; df 1; P < 0.05] and was greatest when a new sexual partner had been acquired in the 2 years before seroconversion (OR 4.78; chi 4.62; df 1; P < 0.05). EBV DNA was detected in 9 of 14 women who seroconverted and also provided cervical samples.

### Comparison of Elecsys and Liaison immunoassays to determine Epstein-Barr virus serological status using further diagnostic approaches to clarify discrepant results [^115guLxV]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Low credibility.

In conclusion, this study showed the similar performance of the Elecsys and the Liaison assays to determine EBV serological status. The Elecsys assay demonstrated excellent sensitivity for the determination of VCA IgG and EBNA IgG markers compared to the Liaison assay. Nevertheless, the lack of sensitivity of the Liaison VCA and EBNA IgG markers is typically without clinical significance in the context of organ donation if the two markers are conducted concomitantly. The Liaison VCA IgM marker was the most sensitive test for diagnosing early primary infection. In case of a suspected IM, serology follow-up or further EBV testing should be carried out to avoid a false-negative result of the VCA IgM marker at an early infection stage. Given the differences in the performance of each single EBV marker in a given commercial assay, the use of more than one automated assay or further diagnostic approaches could be valuable to resolve certain difficult profiles.

### Quantitative analysis of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific CD8+ T cells in patients with chronic active EBV infection [^115BUubg]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

To clarify the pathogenesis of chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, EBV-specific CD8+ T cells were enumerated using human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*2402-restricted tetramers in 8 patients with chronic active EBV infection, 10 patients with infectious mononucleosis, and 16 EBV-seropositive healthy control subjects.

In most patients with chronic active EBV infection, EBV-specific CD8+ T cells were not detected. Notably, latent membrane protein 2-specific CD8+ T cells were undetectable in any patients with chronic active EBV infection. In contrast, EBV-specific CD8+ T cells were detected in patients with infectious mononucleosis and in healthy control subjects. Low frequencies of EBV-specific CD8+ T cells may be one of the immunological features of chronic active EBV infection.

### Laboratory detection and initial diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies [^116SarbZ]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, more specifically with respect to laboratory testing, AACC/ASCP/CAP 2022 guidelines recommend considering the ratio of serum free kappa-to-serum free lambda, IgM isotype, M protein > 1.5 g/dL, and immunoparesis as risk factors for progression to multiple myeloma or a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.

### Comparison of Elecsys and Liaison immunoassays to determine Epstein-Barr virus serological status using further diagnostic approaches to clarify discrepant results [^115w8NLR]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). High credibility.

Serological markers for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection are commonly used to diagnose infectious mononucleosis and establish a serological status in pre-transplant patients. This study prospectively assessed 1043 serum specimens sent to the laboratory for physician-ordered EBV testing. The three markers — antiviral capsid antigen (VCA) immunoglobulin M (IgM), anti-VCA immunoglobulin G (IgG), and anti-Epstein–Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) antibodies — were tested using the Elecsys and the Liaison immunoassays. Specimens with discrepant results between the two assays were assessed using further EBV diagnostic approaches to conclude on the EBV serological status.

In spite of substantial agreement between the two assays (88%) and with the presumed EBV status (> 92%), the results showed differences in the performance of the assays. Liaison VCA IgM appeared to be the most sensitive test for the detection of the 38 sera classified as early primary infection in comparison with the Elecsys assay (91.4% vs. 68.6%, p = 0.008). Excluding the cases of early primary infection, the sensitivity values of the VCA IgM marker were comparable between the Liaison and Elecsys assays (95.2% and 92.9%, respectively, p = 1).

Concerning the sera classified as past infection (n = 763), the Elecsys assay showed higher sensitivity values for the detection of the VCA and EBNA IgG markers in comparison with the Liaison assay (99.9% and 99.7% vs. 97.4% and 91.2%, respectively, p < 0.001). Overall, the Elecsys and Liaison assays showed similar performance.

### Does this patient have infectious mononucleosis? The Rational Clinical Examination systematic review [^111L39fR]. JAMA (2016). Low credibility.

Early and accurate diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis is important as it helps clinicians to target treatment, avoid unnecessary antibiotics, and provide an accurate prognosis.

The objective of the review was to systematically assess the literature regarding the value of clinical examination and white blood cell count for diagnosing mononucleosis.

- **Data sources**: The databases of PubMed (from 1966–2016) and EMBASE (from 1947–2015) were searched, and a total of 670 articles and abstracts were reviewed for eligibility.

- **Study selection**: Eleven studies were included, reporting data sufficient to calculate sensitivity, specificity, or both for clinical examination findings and white blood cell count parameters, compared with a valid reference standard.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Data were abstracted from each article by at least two reviewers, with discrepancies reconciled by consensus. Clinical findings evaluated in only one study are reported with sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio (LR), and 95% confidence interval, calculated from the available data. Findings evaluated in only two studies were summarized with their range; findings evaluated in three studies were summarized with a univariate random-effects summary, and findings evaluated in four or more studies were summarized with a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Sensitivity, specificity, and LRs for the diagnosis of mononucleosis.

Results indicated that mononucleosis is most commonly present among patients aged 5 to 25 years, especially those aged 16–20 years, among whom approximately 1 in 13 patients present with the condition.

### Diagnosis of Epstein-Barr and cytomegalovirus infections using decision trees: An effective way to avoid antibiotic overuse in paediatric tonsillopharyngitis [^115FynnB]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

One explanation for the observed low GAS prevalence could be the overuse of antibiotics, as physicians consider viruses as possible etiologic factors, but in most cases, they start antibiotic treatment as well because of the longer turnaround time of serology, bacterial culture, and the fear of complications from streptococcal illness.

After forming the EBV/CMV and non-EBV/CMV groups based on the serological test, the different clinical parameters were investigated to assess which are characteristic of the EBV/CMV group. Firstly, univariate methods were used to examine each symptom. The results showed that lymphadenitis, hepatosplenomegaly, exudation, and sore throat are the more characteristic symptoms of the EBV/CMV group, and these frequencies proved to be significantly different compared to the non-EBV/CMV group.

Not surprisingly, as these symptoms are already well described and known features of EBV/CMV infections, the prevalence we observed is consistent with the literature. In addition, we found that cough and nasal discharge were significantly less frequent in the EBV/CMV group compared to the non-EBV/CMV group. This finding is also consistent with the literature describing cough and runny nose as less common symptoms than lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or exudation in children with EBV infection.

Analysing blood test parameters and age, we found that the mean levels of GOT and GPT were significantly higher in EBV/CMV patients, while the mean levels of CRP were lower on average. This finding was confirmed by literature data.

### Diagnostic evaluation of mononucleosis-like illnesses [^115LxHTs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Clinicians face a diagnostic challenge when a patient with the classic fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy triad of infectious mononucleosis has a negative "spot" heterophile antibody test. This screening test, although commonly considered sensitive for the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, may be negative early after infection. A growing number of pathogens have been reported to cause heterophile-negative mononucleosis-like illnesses, including cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), adenovirus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), Streptococcus pyogenes, and Toxoplasma gondii. Other infectious and noninfectious disorders may also present in ways that mimic mononucleosis but fail to generate EBV's archetypal triad of clinical findings. A systematic approach to the diagnosis of mononucleosis-like illnesses ensures that conditions warranting specific therapy are distinguished from others requiring only supportive care.

### Comparison of Elecsys and Liaison immunoassays to determine Epstein-Barr virus serological status using further diagnostic approaches to clarify discrepant results [^113NvrLA]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). High credibility.

Immunofluorescence assays (IFA) are considered the gold standard for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serology. Nevertheless, because performing and interpreting IFA is labor-intensive and sometimes subjective, many laboratories use commercially available immunoassays based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or chemiluminescent methods. These assays show good agreement with gold standard assays and are easier to perform. Diagnostic approaches based on IFA, heterophile testing, immunoblot analysis, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to clarify some atypical serological results previously determined by immunoassays.

This large prospective study aimed to evaluate the newly developed automated Elecsys EBV immunoassay in comparison with a widely used immunoassay in laboratories, the Liaison EBV immunoassay. Further diagnostic approaches for EBV diagnosis were performed when discrepant results were observed between the two assays. The independent evaluation of automated immunoassays is crucial to help biologists and clinicians interpret EBV serological status and manage transplanted patients or patients suspected of infectious mononucleosis (IM).

### Positive Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus IgM assays in primary HIV infection [^1149wXTr]. Journal of Medical Virology (2011). Low credibility.

We report three cases with misleading cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immunoglobulin M (IgM) results during primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We determined the rate of positive anti-CMV IgM assays or anti-EBV capsid antigen IgM assays in sera from a group of well-characterized subjects with primary HIV infection as 2.9% (1/35; 95% CI: 0.15–16.6%) for each infection. The rate of positive anti-EBV capsid antigen IgM assays in subjects with positive hepatitis A virus IgM assays was 30% (6/20; 95% CI: 14.6–51.9%).

Clinicians need to consider the limitations of IgM assays for diagnosis of herpesvirus infections and consider testing for other infections with overlapping clinical manifestations.

### Diagnostic evaluation of 2', 5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activities and antibodies against Epstein-Barr virus and Coxiella burnetii in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome in Japan [^113PCw4H]. Microbes and Infection (2003). Low credibility.

To investigate the association of viral infections with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), we assayed 2', 5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2–5AS) activities in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CFS patients in Japan. These patients were diagnosed in two hospitals, H1 and H2, located in different areas of the country. The activities were detected in 19 (86%) and 7 (32%) of each of the 22 patients in H1 and H2, respectively, while they were detected in only four (11%) out of the 38 healthy controls. IFN-alpha was similarly detected in a few CFS patients and healthy controls.

We also assayed the antibody titers against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Coxiella burnetii in these patients. The EBV anti-EA-IgG antibodies were detected in two (9%) and seven (32%) of each of the 22 patients in H1 and H2, respectively. Anti-C. burnetii IgG antibodies were detected in six (27%) out of 22 patients in H1 but not in 22 patients in H2, while they were detected in one (11%) of the nine healthy controls. Some CFS patients may be associated with EBV or C. burnetii infection.

There were some statistical correlations between the 2–5AS activities and antibody titers of EA-IgG (P < 0.05, Student's t-test) but not to the antibody titers of C. burnetii. The up-regulation of 2–5AS activities suggests immunological dysfunctions with some virus infections in the CFS patients. Our results indicate that 2–5AS activities are useful for a diagnostic marker of CFS and for exploring the complicated pathogenesis of CFS.

### Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in sera of patients with primary EBV infection [^112k5ndP]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

Detection of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) DNA by PCR in serum had a sensitivity of 80%, a specificity of 94%, and positive and negative predictive values of 95% and 79%, respectively, for the diagnosis of primary EBV infection. We suggest that this is a useful addition to the panel of tests used for this purpose.

### Seroreactivity against lytic, latent and possible cross-reactive EBV antigens appears on average 10 years before MS induced preclinical neuroaxonal damage [^114RSiQy]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2024). Low credibility.

The strength of this study is the large repository material matched with a national MS register, and sNfL assays performed in aliquots from the same specimens as latency and neutralizing EBV activity and ANO2 reactivity assays. Our material captures a lengthy retrospective period extending well before clinical MS onset, incorporating the long average intervals between IM and MS of 10 years to decades.

A weakness of this study is the lack of individual longitudinal data, which precluded observation of the exact individual sequence of seroconversions and sNfL. Data in the Swedish MS register are generally recorded by neurologists and quality controlled. However, some pre-MS samples were likely drawn during the MS prodrome with undetected subtle initial focal symptoms. This limitation is common to all studies of preclinical events. Still, it was not crucial for this study, which focused on changes in EBV seroreactivity presenting at least a decade before an objective neurochemical sign of MS.

A caveat is that the temporal relationships disclosed here do not exclude the presence of a confounder that could have been evoked by reduced function of natural killer, natural killer T, or CD8+ cells. Low natural killer cell numbers also have been associated with MS. Increased and atypical EBV serology in pre-MS may trace to a relatively more severe primary infection, either because of a higher viral load, possibly dependent on the oral infection pathway, or an insufficient CD8+ T cell response. The subsequent control of the EBV survival also depends on cellular immunity, including CD8+ cells.

### Use of the lymphocyte count as a diagnostic screen in adults with suspected Epstein-Barr virus infectious mononucleosis [^1135R8Ys]. The Laryngoscope (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the predictive diagnostic accuracy of the lymphocyte count in Epstein-Barr virus-related infectious mononucleosis (IM). A retrospective case note and blood results review was conducted within a university-affiliated teaching hospital.

The methods involved a retrospective review of 726 patients who underwent full blood count and Monospot testing. The outcomes of the Monospot tests were compared with the lymphocyte counts, examining significant statistical correlations.

The results indicated that with a lymphocyte count of ≤ 4 × 10⁹/L, 99% of patients had an associated negative Monospot result, achieving a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 94%. In a subanalysis of the population older than 18 years with a lymphocyte count ≤ 4 × 10⁹/L, 100% were Monospot negative, demonstrating a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 97%. A lymphocyte count of ≤ 4 × 10⁹/L correlated significantly with a negative Monospot result.

In conclusion, a lymphocyte count of ≤ 4 × 10⁹/L appears to be a highly reliable predictor of a negative Monospot result, particularly in individuals aged over 18 years. Pediatric patients and adults with strongly suggestive symptoms and signs of IM should still undergo Monospot testing. However, Monospot testing in adults with subtler symptoms and signs, representing the majority, should be restricted to those with a lymphocyte count > 4 × 10⁹/L.

### Laboratory assays for Epstein-Barr virus-related disease [^115inK8D]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2008). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects various cell types in a wide spectrum of benign and malignant diseases. Laboratory tests for EBV have improved and are increasingly used in diagnosis, prognosis, prediction, and prevention of diseases ranging from infectious mononucleosis to selected subtypes of lymphoma, sarcoma, and carcinoma. Indeed, the presence of EBV is among the most effective tumor markers supporting the clinical management of cancer patients. In biopsies, localization of EBER transcripts by in situ hybridization remains the gold standard for identifying latent infection. Other RNA- and protein-based assays detect lytic viral replication and can distinguish carcinoma-derived from lymphocyte-derived EBV in saliva or nasopharyngeal brushings. Analysis of blood using EBV viral load and serology reflects disease status and risk of progression.

This review summarizes prior research in the context of basic virologic principles to provide a rational strategy for applying and interpreting EBV tests in various clinical settings. Such assays have been incorporated into standard clinical practice in selected settings, such as diagnosis of primary infection and management of patients with immune dysfunction or nasopharyngeal carcinoma. As novel therapies are developed that target virus-infected cells or overcome the adverse effects of infection, laboratory testing becomes even more critical for determining when intervention is appropriate and the extent to which it has succeeded.

### Comparison of a transplant multiplex viral panel on the ICEPlex system with real-time PCR for detection of cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and BK virus in clinical specimens [^115FY63b]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

We compared a multiplex viral transplant panel on the ICEPlex system to real-time PCR for the detection of cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and BK virus (BKV). The sensitivities of the ICEPlex were 83.3%, 95.5%, and 65.5% for the detection of CMV, EBV, and BKV, respectively. Interestingly, the multiplex assay detected dual infections in 16 out of 280 (5.7%) samples tested.

### A quantitative study of the decision threshold for the diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis [^11622Bvy]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Ordering a serologic test for infectious mononucleosis (IM) in all young patients with sore throat is costly and impractical. The test threshold to determine when to order a diagnostic test for IM based on the patient's symptoms has not been previously studied.

- **Objective**: To determine the test threshold for IM in the management of patients with sore throat.

- **Design and setting**: Online surveys were sent to a convenience sample of US primary care clinicians regarding their decision-making about whether or not to order a test for IM in a patient with sore throat.

- **Method**: Seven clinical vignettes were created, each with different combinations of symptoms and signs. The probability of IM for each vignette was estimated by the investigator based on the number of symptoms present to generate a plausible range of disease probabilities. Clinicians were then asked to decide whether to test or not test for IM, and mixed-effect logistic regression was used to determine the test threshold for IM where half of physicians chose to test and half chose not to test.

- **Results**: A total of 117 clinicians provided responses for a total of 819 clinical vignettes. The overall test threshold for IM as estimated using logistic regression was 9.5% (95% CI: 8.2% to 10.9%). The test threshold for clinicians practicing greater than 10 years was significantly higher than for those practicing less or equal to 10 years (10.5% vs. 7.3%, P = 0.02). No significant differences between specialties and practice sites were found with respect to the test threshold.

- **Conclusion**: This study identified a test threshold that advises under what circumstances clinicians might consider ordering a test for IM in patients presenting with a sore throat.

### Diagnostic value of serological and molecular biological tests for infectious mononucleosis by EBV in different age stages and course of the disease [^115tPX7B]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-based serologic antibody and viral nucleic acid assays have been found to be feasible means to diagnose infectious mononucleosis (IM) caused by EBV in children. In this study, we further explore their diagnostic value for IM by EBV in different age stages and over the course of the disease. A collection of 616 children from clinically suspected IM cases was studied. Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) for EBV-specific antibodies (Euroimmun) combined with plasma EB viral nucleic acid assay (real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction) were used as reference methods.

The diagnostic efficiency of the peripheral blood routine test, serologic antibody test, and plasma EB viral nucleic acid assay for the diagnosis of IM was evaluated, respectively.

- **Peripheral blood routine test**: The sensitivity, specificity, Youden's index, and the area under curve (AUC) were 93.08%, 87.77%, 0.81, and 0.904 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.878–0.931), respectively, for the peripheral lymphocyte test (lymphocytosis > 5×10^9/L).

- **Plasma EBV-DNA test**: The plasma EBV-DNA test showed a sensitivity of 98.27%, specificity of 91.13%, Youden's index of 0.89, and an AUC of 0.947 (95% CI: 0.927–0.967).

- **EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA)-IgG avidity test**: This test demonstrated a sensitivity of 84.08%, specificity of 96.33%, Youden's index of 0.80, and an AUC of 0.902 (95% CI: 0.874–0.930).

The plasma EBV-DNA test has a higher diagnostic value than the VCA-IgG avidity test in children aged < 6 years, especially those aged < 3 years. The peripheral lymphocyte test and plasma EBV-DNA test are suitable for the early stage of the disease, while the VCA-IgG avidity test is more suitable for after 7 days of the disease. EBV antibody detection (IIF) should be further considered for effective diagnosis.

### Complete Epstein-Barr virus seropositivity in a large cohort of patients with early multiple sclerosis [^113dmAMi]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

The retrospective analysis of EBV seroprevalence in a large hospital population was conducted by analyzing results of EBV serologies for routine diagnostic purposes in 16,163 individuals at Labor Berlin GmbH, Berlin, Germany, from January 2014 to December 2016. Serum samples were submitted for EBV serological testing from patients treated as inpatients or outpatients at university hospitals (Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin) in Berlin or community hospitals in Berlin and Northern Germany. These 16,163 individuals were included in the study regardless of diagnosis or reason for ordering EBV serologies. For those tested multiple times during the study period, only the first EBV serology results were considered.

All included individuals had available results for serological tests for EBNA-1 IgG, VCA IgG, and VCA IgM. Notably, EBNA-1 IgG is a marker of past EBV infection; VCA IgG can be found in both primary and past EBV infections; and VCA IgM is a marker of primary EBV infection. Testing for EBNA-1 IgG, VCA IgG, and VCA IgM was conducted using Liaison automated quantitative CLIA on undiluted sera. The same method (Liaison CLIA) was used for testing both patients with clinically isolated syndrome/relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (CIS/RRMS) and patients from the hospital population. Sera of patients with CIS/RRMS were measured in dilution, while sera from the hospital population were measured without dilution. According to the manufacturer's recommendations, in undiluted sera, EBNA-1 IgG levels less than 5 U/mL were considered negative, and levels between 5 and 20 U/mL were considered equivocal.

### The influence of Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus on childhood respiratory health: A population-based prospective cohort study [^116ik9yi]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

- **Strengths and limitations**: This study was embedded in a population-based cohort study, providing detailed measurements of respiratory health and information on numerous confounders as important strengths. Some limitations should be discussed.

	- First, prospective cohort studies have suggested that early infection with herpesviridae might lead to a decreased risk of atopy, measured by SPT or IgE, and late infections to an increased risk. However, we measured seropositivity for IgG only and were not able to determine the age of seroconversion. Additionally, children in our study with an infection occurring between 6 and 10 years of age would be classified as seronegative, leading to dilution of the effect.

	- Second, it has been suggested that immune responses might differ between asymptomatic and mononucleosis-like infections. Unfortunately, we did not have detailed information on the clinical course of the herpesviridae infections. However, given that we study a childhood cohort with infections before 6 years of age, these infections are most likely mild or asymptomatic.

	- Third, information on asthma was obtained by questionnaire, which might have led to misclassification, although a validated questionnaire was used to minimize bias. Lastly, selection bias due to loss to follow-up might have occurred. Most importantly, those lost to follow-up were more likely to be of non-European ethnicity and more likely to be seropositive for EBV. This might have led to either an over- or underestimation of the effect if the associations of those lost to follow-up with respiratory health were different.

### Validation of an Epstein-Barr virus antibody risk stratification signature for nasopharyngeal carcinoma by use of multiplex serology [^1174Xon7]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). High credibility.

Serological testing for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has recently been reinvigorated by the implementation of novel Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific IgA and IgG antibodies from a proteome array. Although proteome arrays are well suited for comprehensive antigen selection, they are not applicable for large-scale studies. We adapted a 13-marker EBV antigen signature for NPC risk, identified by proteome arrays, to multiplex serology to establish an assay for large-scale studies. Taiwanese NPC cases (n = 175) and matched controls (n = 175) were used for assay validation.

Spearman's correlation was calculated, and the diagnostic value of all multiplex markers was assessed independently using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Two refined signatures were identified using stepwise logistic regression and internally validated with 10-fold cross-validation.

Array and multiplex serology showed strong correlation for each individual EBV marker, as well as for a 13-marker combined model on continuous data. Two refined signatures with either four (LF2 and BGLF2 IgG, LF2 and BMRF1 IgA) or two (LF2 and BGLF2 IgG) antibodies on dichotomous data were identified as the most parsimonious set of serological markers able to distinguish NPC cases from controls with AUCs of 0.992 (95% confidence interval, 0.983 to 1.000) and 0.984 (95% CI, 0.971 to 0.997), respectively. Neither differed significantly from the 13-marker model (AUC, 0.992; 95% CI, 0.982 to 1.000). All models were internally validated.

Multiplex serology successfully validated the original EBV proteome array markers.

### A comprehensive risk score for effective risk stratification and screening of nasopharyngeal carcinoma [^115S5DxT]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

EBV infection occurs early in life in NPC-endemic populations, long before the risk of NPC peaks at 40–50 years of age. The CRS, therefore, can potentially identify individuals at high risk of NPC as early as EBV has established lifelong latency. When we combined standard EBV serology test results with the CRS, setting the cutoff at the top quintile in the general population (represented by population-based controls), the PPV improved by 9-fold (to 43.24%) compared with EBV serology alone (4.70%). Our results thus suggest that the CRS could be used as the first step of population screening to identify individuals at the highest risk of NPC, with this group proceeding to the second step of NPC screening based on EBV serology tests.

In the general population from endemic areas of southern China, approximately 1–5% test at high risk with EBV VCA-/EBNA-1-IgA serology test. Because the CRS was not correlated with EBV serology, the CRS appears to be an independent, nonduplicative predictor of NPC risk. Accordingly, we estimate that approximately 1–5% of the population in the top quintile of the CRS would also test at high risk for EBV serology. Hence, using this two-step screening strategy, 0.2–1% of the general population would be stratified into the highest-risk group by both the CRS and EBV serology tests and could potentially benefit from further preventive actions or surveillance for early diagnosis at an appropriate age. The cost of human and EBV genotyping, as performed in our study, is approximately $16 in U.S. dollars.

### Comparison of Elecsys and Liaison immunoassays to determine Epstein-Barr virus serological status using further diagnostic approaches to clarify discrepant results [^111uDGSr]. Journal of medical virology (2023). High credibility.

- **Clinical performance of the Elecsys and Liaison assays**: The study evaluates the clinical performance of the Elecsys and Liaison assays for determining the serological status of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The metrics used include sensitivity (Sens), specificity (Spe), and agreement with the reference EBV status (Agrmt).

- **Characteristics of discrepant results**:
	- For the Liaison assay, the study examines the characteristics of discrepant results.
	- Similarly, the evaluation extends to the discrepant results associated with the Elecsys assay.

The findings provide insight into the accuracy and reliability of these assays in clinical settings for EBV serological status determination.

### Epstein-Barr virus infection in ulcerative colitis: A clinicopathologic study from a Chinese area [^111nj7mS]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) commonly infects B lymphocytes, but the prevalence and phenotype of the viral infection vary significantly between countries and regions. Chronic active EBV (CAEBV) infective enteritis, a severe form of EBV-related disease in the intestine, is prevalent in East Asian countries and is characterized by clonal expansion of virally infected T or NK lymphocytes. In contrast, in Western countries, CAEBV is mostly associated with B cells. However, few studies have focused on this issue in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with EBV infection, especially in Asian countries.

There are no standard diagnostic criteria currently available for EBV opportunistic infection or EBV colitis in UC. Additionally, distinguishing between latent viral infection and active EBV disease is difficult. Various techniques have been attempted to diagnose EBV infection, including serology, EBV-DNA testing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood and colon mucosa, EBV-antigen testing by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER) detection by in situ hybridization (ISH). Due to the high sensitivity and specificity of EBER-ISH and its precise cellular localization, some studies have recommended EBER-ISH as the gold standard for detecting EBV infection in the intestine. At the time of writing, few studies have reported EBER findings among UC patients, particularly Chinese patients. Moreover, the role of EBV infection in UC progression has not been clearly elucidated. EBV blood testing, a noninvasive and simple screening method, has also been utilized in clinical practice to screen for EBV.

### Comparison of Elecsys and Liaison immunoassays to determine Epstein-Barr virus serological status using further diagnostic approaches to clarify discrepant results [^1141iLbW]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Low credibility.

Serum specimens displaying discrepant results between the Elecsys and Liaison assays were evaluated in the reference laboratory (Virology Laboratory). Further diagnostic approaches were performed if the interpretation of the EBV serological pattern differed between the Elecsys and Liaison assays (see Supporting Information: Table S2).

Complementary EBV testing included the Vidas VCA IgM, VCA/EA IgG, and EBNA IgG assays (Biomerieux); anti-EBV IgM and IgG immunoblot assays (Euroline anti-EBV Profil 2, Euroimmun France); anti-VCA IgM and IgG IFA (Euroimmun); heterophile antibody detection (Monospot Latex; Meridian Bioscience); and EBV PCR (EBV R-gene; Biomérieux).

The Vidas assay was performed for the majority of specimens with discrepant interpretation. If the Vidas assay was not contributive, an IgG or IgM immunoblot assay was performed to rule out the possibility of a false-positive result in one or several markers. In cases of suspected primary infection not confirmed by previous testing, heterophile antibody testing was performed, considering that this test has better sensitivity in patients older than 5 years of age. The IFA was most frequently initiated to discriminate a primary infection with isolated anti-VCA IgM antibodies from a seronegative status with false IgM. EBV DNA detection in serum by PCR, associated with isolated anti-VCA IgM, argued in favor of a primary infection. As PCR in serum is positive only 1 or 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms, a negative PCR result could not exclude a diagnosis of primary infection.

### Serological cross reactivity to CMV and EBV causes problems in the diagnosis of acute hepatitis E virus infection [^116Fd6JL]. Journal of Medical Virology (2014). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is an important public health concern as a major cause of enterically-transmitted hepatitis worldwide. The detectable window of viraemia is narrow, and HEV IgM and IgG rise simultaneously in acute infection. Furthermore, previous investigators have shown that HEV IgM false positive reactions occur against EBV, CMV, and potentially hepatitis A. A retrospective analysis of HEV serology testing was performed at a London tertiary referral hospital over a 3-year period. A total of 1,423 serum samples were tested for HEV serology, with 33 samples testing HEV IgM positive and 28 samples being HEV IgM equivocal. One hundred and eleven samples were HEV IgG positive but IgM negative, suggesting past infection.

No patients with HEV IgM positivity had false positive reactions against hepatitis A. A high degree of EBV and CMV cross-reactivity was noted, with 33.3% and 24.2% of HEV IgM positive samples also testing positive for EBV and CMV IgM, respectively. HEV RNA was detected in four HEV IgM positive samples, indicating true positivity, although three demonstrated cross-reactivity against EBV. Only 13.3% of samples with positive HEV IgM were HEV PCR positive, highlighting a low positive predictive value of serology testing. Overall, a high level of HEV, EBV, and CMV IgM cross-reactivity was demonstrated, indicating that serology is unreliable in the diagnosis of acute viral hepatitis. It is concluded that the diagnosis of viral hepatitis should be based on clinical features, raised transaminases, serology, and confirmatory PCR testing.
