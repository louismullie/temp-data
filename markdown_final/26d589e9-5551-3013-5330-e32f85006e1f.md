## Question

How long should you keep someone on fluids for hypercalcemi and how do you decide what rate it should be at?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long to continue intravenous fluids for hypercalcemia and how to determine the appropriate infusion rate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity of hypercalcemia. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology that drives fluid therapy. Next, I will review guideline-based targets for urine output and the initial bolus and maintenance rates. After that, I need to consider special populations and comorbidities that modify rate and duration. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and explicitly state when to stop fluids, anchoring to high-quality guidelines and pivotal studies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and severity, because duration and intensity of fluids hinge on whether the hypercalcemia is mild, moderate, or severe, and whether it is acute and symptomatic. Severe hypercalcemia is typically defined as total calcium greater than 14 mg/dL or ionized calcium greater than 10 mg/dL, and it carries higher morbidity and mortality, warranting aggressive inpatient management, whereas mild cases may be managed conservatively as outpatients if stable and asymptomatic [^df83001d] [^f92ff096].

> I need to check the pathophysiology to justify fluids. Hypercalcemia causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with polyuria, leading to volume depletion, reduced GFR, and impaired calciuresis; restoring intravascular volume with isotonic saline increases GFR and promotes natriuresis with calciuresis, thereby lowering serum calcium, which is why hydration is first-line while we await antiresorptives to work [^e94e17a0] [^c6ded4aa].

> Next, I should review the quantitative targets. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on maintaining a urine output of 100 to 150 mL per hour using isotonic saline, which operationalizes the calciuretic goal; this range balances effective calcium excretion with the risk of volume overload and guides titration of the infusion rate in real time [^b27b8516] [^1c93ff8c] [^4bdd120e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a fixed duration; I should confirm the practical endpoint. Fluids are continued until the patient is euvolemic, clinically stable, and able to maintain adequate oral intake, with electrolytes corrected and the calcium trend moving toward a safer range; in many inpatients this spans roughly 24 to 72 hours, but the stop criterion is clinical repletion rather than a rigid time window, and some patients with ongoing losses or refractory hypercalcemia may need longer, carefully monitored courses [^c6ded4aa] [^d92d9ce7].

> I will now examine the initial fluid strategy. A common approach is to give a 1 to 2 liter isotonic saline bolus promptly, then transition to a maintenance rate of 200 to 500 mL per hour, titrating to the 100 to 150 mL per hour urine output target while reassessing volume status frequently; this balances rapid volume repletion with the risk of overload and is supported by endocrine and oncology guidelines as well as supportive care reviews [^b27b8516] [^1c93ff8c] [^c4a69be2].

> But wait, what if the patient has heart failure or CKD? I should double-check modifications. In CHF, CKD, or elderly patients, slower rates and smaller boluses are prudent, with closer monitoring of urine output, weight, lungs, and electrolytes; loop diuretics may be used judiciously only after euvolemia is achieved to manage fluid overload, not as a routine anticalcemic strategy, and zoledronic acid requires renal function assessment and dose adjustments in significant impairment [^f95374d2] [^ced19b34] [^a4a925c2].

> Let me consider special scenarios. In multiple myeloma with cast nephropathy, prompt IV fluids to achieve 100 to 150 mL per hour urine output are recommended to reduce light chain concentration and mitigate renal injury, with careful attention to avoiding hypervolemia in oliguric renal failure; in parathyroid carcinoma, aggressive hydration is first-line while arranging definitive therapy, and calcimimetics or antiresorptives are layered as needed; in life-threatening hypercalcemia with renal or cardiac compromise, hemodialysis may be required when fluids are unsafe or insufficient [^4bdd120e] [^343641eb] [^2d46198e] [^d27b1746].

> I should confirm the monitoring cadence. Frequent assessment of vitals, lung exam, daily weights, strict intake-output with hourly urine targets, and serial calcium, creatinine, electrolytes, and magnesium are essential; overhydration can precipitate pulmonary edema, and diuresis can unmask hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia that perpetuate arrhythmias, so proactive repletion and rate adjustments are part of safe care [^b27b8516] [^94b4e4b6].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. Start with a 1 to 2 liter normal saline bolus if volume depleted, then run 200 to 500 mL per hour, titrating to 100 to 150 mL per hour urine output while correcting electrolytes; continue until the patient is euvolemic, clinically stable, taking adequate oral fluids, and the calcium is trending down or near a safe range; in most inpatients this is 1 to 3 days, but extend if losses persist or antiresorptives have not yet taken effect, and escalate to dialysis or alternative agents if refractory or if fluids are contraindicated [^b27b8516] [^c6ded4aa] [^d27b1746].

> Finally, I should verify the bottom line. There is no fixed duration for IV fluids in hypercalcemia; duration is determined by restoration of volume, achievement of calciuresis with 100 to 150 mL per hour urine output, clinical stability, and the ability to transition to oral intake, with therapy individualized to comorbidities and response; in severe cases, expect at least 24 to 72 hours in many patients, but stop when the clinical goals are met rather than the clock [^b27b8516] [^c6ded4aa] [^d92d9ce7].

---

For hypercalcemia, continue IV fluids until the patient is **euvolemic** and **urine output is 100–150 mL/h** [^b27b8516] [^1c93ff8c], typically 24–72 hours, then transition to oral intake. Start with a 1–2 L isotonic saline bolus [^b27b8516], then maintain 200–500 mL/h [^1c93ff8c], adjusting to patient factors and urine output. Stop fluids if urine output exceeds 150 mL/h, volume overload occurs, or calcium normalizes; in renal or cardiac disease, use lower rates and consider dialysis if fluids are unsafe or ineffective [^d27b1746].

---

## Indications for intravenous fluid therapy in hypercalcemia

IV fluids are indicated for hypercalcemia when:

- **Severe hypercalcemia**: Total calcium > 14 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/L) or ionized calcium > 10 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) [^f92ff096].
- **Moderate hypercalcemia**: Total calcium 12–14 mg/dL (3.0–3.5 mmol/L) with symptoms or acute rise [^notfound].
- **Mild hypercalcemia**: Total calcium < 12 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) with significant symptoms or dehydration [^notfound].

---

## Goals of intravenous fluid therapy

The primary goals of IV fluid therapy in hypercalcemia are to:

- **Restore intravascular volume**: Correct dehydration from polyuria and vomiting [^e94e17a0].
- **Enhance renal calcium excretion**: Increase GFR and calciuresis [^94b4e4b6].
- **Stabilize hemodynamics**: Improve perfusion and organ function [^notfound].

---

## Recommended duration of intravenous fluid therapy

The duration of IV fluids varies with severity, response, and comorbidities; **typical duration is 24–72 hours**, with adjustments based on clinical response and urine output [^notfound].

| **Severity of hypercalcemia** | **Recommended duration of iv fluids** |
|-|-|
| Mild (< 12 mg/dL) | 24–48 hours, then oral hydration if stable |
| Moderate (12–14 mg/dL) | 48–72 hours, then reassess |
| Severe (> 14 mg/dL) | 72 hours or more, until euvolemic and calcium controlled |

---

Stop IV fluids when the patient is **euvolemic**, urine output is 100–150 mL/h [^b27b8516], calcium is normalizing, and oral intake is adequate; discontinue if volume overload or electrolyte disturbances occur [^218e6f27].

---

## Determining the appropriate infusion rate

Infusion rate should be **individualized** to severity, dehydration, and comorbidities:

- **Initial bolus**: 1–2 L isotonic saline over 1–2 hours [^b27b8516].
- **Maintenance rate**: 200–500 mL/h, titrated to urine output and tolerance [^1c93ff8c] [^b27b8516].
- **Target urine output**: 100–150 mL/h (about 2–3 L/day) [^b27b8516] [^218e6f27].

---

## Factors influencing infusion rate adjustments

Several factors influence **rate adjustments**:

- **Severity of hypercalcemia**: Higher rates in severe cases [^notfound].
- **Degree of dehydration**: Adjust to correct volume deficit [^94b4e4b6].
- **Cardiac and renal function**: Use lower rates in CHF, CKD, or elderly [^f95374d2].
- **Comorbidities**: Tailor to COPD, liver disease, or pregnancy [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and reassessment

Close monitoring is essential; **check urine output hourly** and adjust the infusion to maintain 100–150 mL/h [^b27b8516]. Monitor serum calcium, creatinine, electrolytes, and acid-base status daily, and assess for volume overload with daily weights, lung exam, and edema. Reduce or stop fluids if overload, hyponatremia, or hypokalemia develop [^notfound].

---

## Transition from intravenous to oral hydration

Transition to oral hydration when:

- **Stable calcium**: Corrected calcium < 12 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) [^notfound].
- **Urine output**: Maintained at 100–150 mL/h [^b27b8516].
- **Oral intake**: Adequate and tolerated [^notfound].
- **Euvolemia**: No signs of overload or dehydration [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Use caution; consider dialysis if fluids are unsafe or ineffective [^d27b1746].
- **Cardiac impairment**: Use lower rates; monitor closely for overload [^f95374d2].
- **Pregnancy**: Use caution; monitor maternal and fetal status [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Duration**: Typically 24–72 hours, individualized to response and comorbidities.
- **Rate**: Start with 1–2 L bolus, then 200–500 mL/h, titrated to urine output and tolerance [^b27b8516] [^1c93ff8c].
- **Stop**: When euvolemic, urine output 100–150 mL/h, calcium normalizing, and oral intake adequate [^b27b8516].
- **Monitor**: Urine output, calcium, electrolytes, renal function, and volume status closely [^b27b8516].

---

IV fluids are a cornerstone of hypercalcemia management; **individualize duration and rate** to severity, response, and comorbidities, with close monitoring to ensure safety and efficacy.

Comparative effectiveness of six to eight hour infusions of phosphate, sulfate, and hydrocortisone was studied in 22 hypercalcemic patients with neoplastic disease. Mean maximum reduction in serum calcium level with phosphate was dose dependent: 25 millimols, 1. 1 mg/100 ml; 50 millimols,
2. 44 mg/100 ml; 75 millimols, 4. 13 mg/ 100 ml; and 100 millimols,
6. 08 mg/100 ml. The reduction was also directly related to the rise in serum phosphate level. Sulfate infusion caused an average maximum decrease of serum calcium of 1. 87 mg/100 ml. Hydrocortisone produced minor inconsistent changes in serum calcium and phosphate levels. Infusions of phosphate caused reduction in urinary calcium and rise in phosphate level. Both sulfate and hydrocortisone infusions resulted in rises in urinary calcium and urinary phosphate. These studies demonstrate the superiority of phosphate in treatment of hypercalcemia and suggest guidelines for dose selection.

### Rapid fire: hypercalcemia [^d1247de0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is commonly encountered in the clinical setting and requires identification by the clinician to avoid disastrous patient outcomes. The 2 most common causes are malignancy and hyperparathyroidism. The underlying cause for hypercalcemia may be readily known at presentation or may require further investigation. After identification, acuity of treatment will depend on severity of calcium level and symptoms. In the emergency setting, intravenous hydration with isotonic fluids is the treatment mainstay. Other commonly used medications to further decrease calcium include bisphosphates, calcitonin, steroids, and (rarely) furosemide. In life-threatening circumstances, dialysis can be implemented.

Treatment of hypercalcaemia of malignancy

The most effective therapy for patients with hypercalcaemia of malignancy is treatment of the underlying cancer in order to reduce tumour production of factors that promote bone resorption and renal tubular calcium reabsorption; however, this may not be possible or effective in patients with advanced cancer. Therapies that inhibit bone resorption and promote renal calcium excretion therefore become important. Most patients with hypercalcaemia of malignancy are dehydrated at presentation and rehydration is often the first step of treatment. Saline should be given at a maximal initial rate of 200–300 mL/h, then adjusted to maintain a urine output of 100–150 mL/h. This, however, relieves the symptoms rather than addressing the underlying disease, and therefore, rehydration alone rarely resolves hypercalcaemia. Nearly all patients with hypercalcaemia of malignancy have increased osteoclastic bone resorption; hence, inhibition of bone resorption is a key target for management of the condition.

Treatment regimens for hypercalcemia of malignancy — initial measures include isotonic saline hydration, loop diuretics (furosemide), and calcitonin (CT). Isotonic saline hydration uses a bolus of 1 to 2 L then 200 to 500 mL/hour to maintain urine output at 100 to 150 mL/hour and during infusion lowers calcium by 1 to 1.5 mg/dL (0.25 to 0.375 mmol/L) over first 24 hours, with advice to carefully assess for volume overload. Loop diuretics have onset within 3 to 60 minutes and, after resolution of volume depletion, lower calcium by 0.5 to 1.0 mg/dL (0.125 to 0.25 mmol/L), with cautions for volume depletion and worsening HCM and potential usefulness in patients at risk for volume overload/congestive heart failure. Calcitonin is dosed 4 to 8 units/kg intramuscular or SQ every 6 to 12 hours for 48 to 72 hours, has effects over 6 to 8 hours with rapid calcium reduction by 1 to 2 mg/dL (0.25 to 0.50 mmol/L), and tachyphylaxis may occur after 48 to 72 hours.

### Assessment and management of patients with abnormal calcium [^fc3276ac]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Calcium is essential for homeostasis, and normocalcemia should be maintained strictly during the perioperative period. The biochemistry of calcium equilibrium results from the calcium-sensing receptors on the parathyroid glands, which detect changes in calcium concentrations and initiate the proper response. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia is a common metabolic derangement that is often discovered on routine serum screening. The most common etiologies are primary hyperparathyroidism and cancer. Increasingly, parathyroidectomy is the preferred therapy for primary hyperparathyroidism. Severe hypercalcemia ("hypercalcemic crisis") should be managed aggressively with a combination of intravenous fluids, steroids, bisphosphonates, and calcitonin. Some of these patients may require an urgent parathyroidectomy for calcium control. Hypocalcemia needs to be verified, as many cases of hypocalcemia are the artifact of hypoalbuminemia. Severe hypocalcemia occurs after subtotal or total parathyroidectomy with auto transplantation as well as after massive resuscitation or blood transfusion. Strategies aimed at correcting calcium concentrations depend on the severity of symptomatology. If symptoms are mild, oral calcium supplementation can be given; otherwise, intravenous calcium should be administered.

### A practical approach to hypercalcemia [^752c52f4]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a disorder commonly encountered by primary care physicians. The diagnosis often is made incidentally in asymptomatic patients. Clinical manifestations affect the neuromuscular, gastrointestinal, renal, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems. The most common causes of hypercalcemia are primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy. Some other important causes of hypercalcemia are medications and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. An initial diagnostic work-up should include measurement of intact parathyroid hormone, and any medications that are likely to be causative should be discontinued. Parathyroid hormone is suppressed in malignancy-associated hypercalcemia and elevated in primary hyperparathyroidism. It is essential to exclude other causes before considering parathyroid surgery, and patients should be referred for parathyroidectomy only if they meet certain criteria. Many patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have a benign course and do not need surgery. Hypercalcemic crisis is a life-threatening emergency. Aggressive intravenous rehydration is the mainstay of management in severe hypercalcemia, and antiresorptive agents, such as calcitonin and bisphosphonates, frequently can alleviate the clinical manifestations of hypercalcemic disorders.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy — special populations guidance (Figure 2) states for HCM associated with high calcitriol levels to provide adequate IV saline hydration and glucocorticoids (Recommendation 5), and if there is inadequate control (severe or symptomatic HCM), suggest adding IV BP or Dmab (Recommendation 5). For parathyroid carcinoma, initial management is adequate hydration and suggest calcimimetic or IV BP or Dmab (Recommendation 6); if inadequate control with calcimimetic, suggest adding IV BP or Dmab (Recommendation 7), and if inadequate control with IV BP or Dmab, suggest adding calcimimetic (Recommendation 8).

### Treatment of extreme hypercalcaemia: the role of haemodialysis [^03b79045]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Patients with hypercalcaemia may present with neurological signs, including CNS dysfunction, memory disturbances, obtundation or coma. In addition, muscle weakness, constipation, shortening of QT segment on the ECG and band keratopathy due to corneal calcium deposits can be observed. Kidney disorders caused by hypercalcaemia include acute and chronic kidney injury, nephrolithiasis and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

Recognition of hypercalcaemia and urgent treatment can be lifesaving. The key stones of hypercalcaemia treatment are vigorous intravenous volume expansion with saline, bisphosphonate therapy, calcitonin, corticosteroids and loop diuretic to enhance renal excretion of calcium. Patients with severe hypercalcaemia are usually volume depleted due to anorexia, nausea and changes in sensorium with decreased fluid intake. Polyuria and decreased urinary concentration ability due to downregulation of aquaporin may cause additional fluid loss. Intravenous fluid infusion will help to restore intravascular volume and increases urinary calcium excretion. It should be started immediately and helps to decrease calcium rapidly to relatively safe levels. The rate of fluid infusion (usually with normal saline) must take into account age of the patient, comorbidities, especially oedematous states (eg, congestive heart failure or renal failure) and is usually done at the rate of 200–300 mL/hour in relation to urine output. Glucorticoids are especially effective in absorptive hypercalcaemia and can decrease intestinal calcium absorption. They also decrease 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production in patients with granulomatous diseases or lymphoma.RANK-L inhibitor — Denosumab (Amgen) (0.13 mg/kg) may be used for treatment of hypercalcaemia in patients with renal failure, where bisphosphonates are relatively contraindicated.

5 CONCLUSION

Severe hypercalcaemia is an endocrine emergency that can have severe neurological, cardiac, and renal consequences. Thus, appropriate and prompt management is necessary. Our results showed the absence of a significant additional effect of furosemide on serum calcium levels in patients with severe hypercalcaemia secondary to primary hyperparathyroidism when compared with the effect of saline hydration alone. However, zoledronic acid was more potent. Thus, appropriate normal saline hydration with immediate intravenous bisphosphonates infusion should be considered in the management of severe hypercalcaemia in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) ungraded good practice statements — The panel lists eight UGPSs: 1) "adequate hydration with intravenous (IV) fluids is first-line therapy while awaiting the effect of antiresorptive drugs" and therapy should be "tailored according to cardiac function"; 2) "dental hygiene and oral health, including visual examination of the mouth, should be monitored" during antiresorptive therapy; 3) to avoid hypocalcemia with antiresorptives, "vitamin D levels should be monitored and managed in accordance with Endocrine Society vitamin D guidelines", noting "These guidelines are however not specific to patients with HCM"; 4) "renal function (creatinine clearance or estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) should be assessed prior to administration of IV BPs"; 5) in renal insufficiency ("creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min") treated with IV BPs, use "renal BP dosing of zoledronic acid over 30 to 60 minutes or renal BP dosing of pamidronate over 2 to 24 hours"; 6) "serum magnesium and phosphorous levels should be monitored and repleted if deemed to be low"; 7) "clinical oncology consultation to guide treatment of the underlying malignancy should be obtained"; and 8) for hypercalcemia due to parathyroid carcinoma, "surgical consultation should be pursued for definitive treatment".

Calcitonin adjunct and evidence-to-decision considerations for severe HCM — The panel conducted a systematic review and did not identify any evidence for acceptability, equity, resources, or feasibility, judged "don't know" for the balance of effects, and noted that calcitonin is extremely expensive in the United States. The panel discussed that, in patients with severe HCM and possibly in those with renal dysfunction, calcitonin in addition to IV fluids to temper hypercalcemia (while awaiting the effects of more potent agents with bisphosphonates or denosumab), may be appropriate. A case series reported on 4 patients with HCM due to multiple myeloma and renal dysfunction treated with Dmab, of whom 3 also received calcitonin and SCa normalized in 2. Research priorities include RCTs with BPs and/or Dmab in HCM, head to head RCTs assessing clinically important outcomes, potential global collaboration due to the relative rarity of HCM, addressing gaps in complementary evidence including health services delivery, costs/cost-effectiveness, patients' values and preferences, equity, acceptability, and feasibility, and evidence regarding the pathophysiology and management of rebound HCM following Dmab discontinuation.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) — initial management workflow (Figure 2) directs that mild HCM receive adequate hydration and avoidance of exacerbating factors, while moderate HCM that is chronic and asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic uses the same approach as mild HCM. For moderate HCM with an acute increase in serum calcium or symptomatic, provide adequate IV saline hydration and recommend denosumab (Dmab) or intravenous bisphosphonate (IV BP) over no treatment (Recommendation 1), and suggest Dmab over IV BP (Recommendation 2). For severe HCM, adequate IV saline hydration and suggest calcitonin as initial treatment with IV BP or Dmab (Recommendation 3). For refractory or recurrent HCM on BP, adequate IV saline hydration and suggest Dmab (Recommendation 4).

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2026 Multiple Myeloma — supportive care for renal involvement advises that IV fluids should be started promptly to decrease the renal tubular light chain concentration with a goal urine output of 100 to 150 cc per hour, with careful assessment of the fluid status to avoid hypervolemia, especially in oliguric renal failure; nephrotoxic medications should be discontinued and metabolic abnormalities such as hypercalcemia and hyperuricemia should be corrected. Hydration, bisphosphonates or denosumab, and calcitonin are recommended to reduce calcium levels in the case of hypercalcemia, and in patients with renal disease, pamidronate and zoledronic acid should be used with caution. Dialysis may be required in selected patients in addition to prompt initiation of anti-myeloma therapy, and mechanical removal of light chains may be considered on a case-by-case basis; the initial treatment of cast nephropathy includes initiating appropriate MM therapy and providing adequate supportive care.

### Hypercalcemia: a review… [^705d10a2]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Hypercalcemia that is severe, defined as total calcium of 14 mg/dL or greater or ionized calcium of 10 mg/dL or greater or that develops rapidly over days to weeks, can cause nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma. Hypercalcemia has been associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 protein inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, denosumab discontinuation, SARS-CoV-2, ketogenic diets, and extreme exercise, but these account for less than 1% of causes. Serum intact parathyroid hormone, the most important initial test to evaluate hypercalcemia, distinguishes PTH-dependent from PTH-independent causes. In a patient with hypercalcemia, an elevated or normal PTH concentration is consistent with PHPT, while a suppressed PTH level indicates another cause. Mild hypercalcemia usually does not need acute intervention.

If due to PHPT, parathyroidectomy may be considered depending on age, serum calcium level, and kidney or skeletal involvement. In patients older than 50 years with serum calcium levels less than 1 mg above the upper normal limit and no evidence of skeletal or kidney disease, observation may be appropriate. Initial therapy of symptomatic or severe hypercalcemia consists of hydration and intravenous bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid or pamidronate. In patients with kidney failure, denosumab and dialysis may be indicated. Glucocorticoids may be used as primary treatment when hypercalcemia is due to excessive intestinal calcium absorption. Treatment reduces serum calcium and improves symptoms, at least transiently. The underlying cause of hypercalcemia should be identified and treated. The prognosis for asymptomatic PHPT is excellent with either medical or surgical management.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy is associated with poor survival. Conclusions and Relevance Mild hypercalcemia is typically asymptomatic, while severe hypercalcemia is associated with nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia due to primary hyperparathyroidism is managed with parathyroidectomy or observation with monitoring, while severe hypercalcemia is typically treated with hydration and intravenous bisphosphonates.

### Hypercalcemia: a review [^f92ff096]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hypercalcemia affects approximately 1% of the worldwide population. Mild hypercalcemia, defined as total calcium of less than 12 mg/dL (< 3 mmol/L) or ionized calcium of 5.6 to 8.0 mg/dL (1.4–2 mmol/L), is usually asymptomatic but may be associated with constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and constipation in approximately 20% of people. Hypercalcemia that is severe, defined as total calcium of 14 mg/dL or greater (> 3.5 mmol/L) or ionized calcium of 10 mg/dL or greater (≥ 2.5 mmol/L) or that develops rapidly over days to weeks, can cause nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma.

Observations

Approximately 90% of people with hypercalcemia have primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) or malignancy. Additional causes of hypercalcemia include granulomatous disease such as sarcoidosis, endocrinopathies such as thyroid disease, immobilization, genetic disorders, and medications such as thiazide diuretics and supplements such as calcium, vitamin D, or vitamin A. Hypercalcemia has been associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 protein inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, denosumab discontinuation, SARS-CoV-2, ketogenic diets, and extreme exercise, but these account for less than 1% of causes. Serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), the most important initial test to evaluate hypercalcemia, distinguishes PTH-dependent from PTH-independent causes. In a patient with hypercalcemia, an elevated or normal PTH concentration is consistent with PHPT, while a suppressed PTH level (< 20 pg/mL depending on assay) indicates another cause. Mild hypercalcemia usually does not need acute intervention. If due to PHPT, parathyroidectomy may be considered depending on age, serum calcium level, and kidney or skeletal involvement. In patients older than 50 years with serum calcium levels less than 1 mg above the upper normal limit and no evidence of skeletal or kidney disease, observation may be appropriate. Initial therapy of symptomatic or severe hypercalcemia consists of hydration and intravenous bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid or pamidronate. In patients with kidney failure, denosumab and dialysis may be indicated. Glucocorticoids may be used as primary treatment when hypercalcemia is due to excessive intestinal calcium absorption (vitamin D intoxication, granulomatous disorders, some lymphomas). Treatment reduces serum calcium and improves symptoms, at least transiently. The underlying cause of hypercalcemia should be identified and treated. The prognosis for asymptomatic PHPT is excellent with either medical or surgical management. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is associated with poor survival.

Conclusions and Relevance

Mild hypercalcemia is typically asymptomatic, while severe hypercalcemia is associated with nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia due to primary hyperparathyroidism is managed with parathyroidectomy or observation with monitoring, while severe hypercalcemia is typically treated with hydration and intravenous bisphosphonates.

### Narrative review: furosemide for hypercalcemia: an unproven yet common practice [^bc66f349]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Although primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of hypercalcemia, cancer is the most common cause requiring inpatient intervention. An estimated 10% to 20% of all patients with cancer have hypercalcemia at some point in their disease trajectory, particularly in advanced disease. Aggressive saline hydration and varying doses of furosemide continue to be the standard of care for emergency management. However, a review of the evidence for the use of furosemide in the medical management of hypercalcemia yields only case reports published before the introduction of bisphosphonates, in contrast to multiple randomized, controlled trials supporting the use of bisphosphonates. The use of furosemide in the management of hypercalcemia should no longer be recommended.

Clinical manifestations of hypercalcemia levels

For symptomatic hypercalcemia, typically when the total serum concentration is around 3 mmol/L or when the calcium level exceeds 3.74 mmol/L, immediate treatment is necessary. The primary focus is on restoring intravascular volume and facilitating calcium urine excretion. In patients with sufficient renal and cardiovascular function, this is achieved by administering 0.9% saline allowing for serum calcium dilution and urinary calcium excretion. The infusion continues until any fluid deficit is addressed and adequate diuresis is established. Throughout this treatment, closely monitor and sustain appropriate levels of potassium and magnesium due to the diuresis potentially causing deficiencies. Loop diuretics also increase calcium excretion, but should be used with caution because they may contribute to intravascular dehydration. Calcitonin may be used transiently (max. 48–72 h) due to the risk of tachyphylaxis. Intravenous bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of bone resorption, effectively lowering serum calcium levels. Denosumab can be used in patients with contraindications for bisphosphonates (e.g. chronic kidney disease). Glucocorticoids are also effective in reducing calcium levels, particularly in granulomatous disease. In cases where there is a need for a rapid reduction in serum calcium, especially in patients with renal or cardiac dysfunction, hemodialysis is the preferred treatment. For severe conditions, chelating agents like 50 mmol of phosphate administered orally over 8 to 12 h or EDTA at a dose of 10 to 50 mg/kg over 4 h may be employed.

Research considerations — evidence gaps for hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM): Head to head RCTs of IV BPs vs Dmab are needed to assess clinically important outcomes for this intervention, including clinical improvement. Because of the rarity of this condition, RCTs may require global collaboration. Assessing appropriate glucocorticoid dosing and duration in this population and determining continued glucocorticoid need if antiresorptive therapy is administered are needed. Significant gaps in research exist regarding complementary evidence for the treatment of HCM, including health services delivery, costs/cost-effectiveness of treatment, patients' values and preferences, equity, acceptability, and feasibility.

Lung cancer — hypercalcemia of malignancy: Hypercalcemia occurs in 10% to 25% of patients with lung cancer and is most commonly seen in patients with squamous cell lung cancer; the median survival after discovery of hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients with lung cancer is about 1 month. When hypercalcemia is severe (> 14.0 mg/dL), patients may develop mental status changes, bradycardia, and hypotension, and the diagnostic evaluation includes measuring serum concentrations of iPTH, PTHrP, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcium, albumin, magnesium, and phosphorus. There are guidelines for the management of hypercalcemia, but they are not specifically for patients with lung cancer; oral hydration may be effective in mild hypercalcemia, in moderate to severe hypercalcemia management includes rehydrating with IV crystalloid fluids not containing calcium and giving loop diuretics (eg, furosemide) as needed after correction of intravascular volume; bisphosphonates (clodronate, pamidronate, and zoledronic acid) usually are effective, and additional therapeutic options such as glucocorticoids, gallium nitrate, and salmon calcitonin may be considered.

### Approach to diagnosis and treatment of hypercalcemia in a patient with malignancy [^25034d33]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a common complication of malignancy and portends a worse prognosis. It causes a variety of symptoms in patients, which can range from confusion and polyuria to coma and death. There are 4 broad mechanistic categories to classify hypercalcemia of malignancy: local osteolysis secondary to metastatic cancer or multiple myeloma, excess parathyroid-related hormone, excess 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production, and ectopic parathyroid hormone production. Volume expansion with normal saline solution and treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates to decrease osteoclast-mediated bone destruction are effective initial therapies. Calcitonin, gallium nitrate, and corticosteroids can serve as adjunctive therapies. Denosumab is an attractive therapeutic option for refractory cases of hypercalcemia, although more data are required before this therapy can be recommended.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: finding the balance [^3ace3603]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

In patients with severe hypercalcaemia, the hormone calcitonin is an important adjunctive treatment that acts within 4 h of administration and can be used to immediately reduce calcium plasma concentrations. Calcitonin reduces calcium concentration by inhibiting osteoclast activity and increasing renal calcium clearance. It should be given at a dose of 4–8 units/kg subcutaneously or intramuscularly every 6–12 h; duration of dosing is, however, limited to 48 h owing to the development of tachyphylaxis and decreased responsiveness.

Currently, the standard treatment for hypercalcaemia of malignancy is rehydration combined with intravenous bisphosphonate therapy, with zoledronic acid preferred over pamidronate. In some countries, denosumab is approved for use in patients with bisphosphonate-refractory hypercalcaemia. In addition, calcitonin may be useful for patients with severe or life-threatening hypercalcaemia because it causes a rapid, albeit transient, decrease of high serum calcium levels.

2 METHODS

This was a retrospective, single‐centre study including patients with severe hypercalcaemia secondary to primary hyperparathyroidism who were admitted between January 2012 and March 2021. Inclusion criteria were patients with primary hyperparathyroidism aged more than 18 years, with a corrected total serum calcium level ≥ 3.5 or ≥ 3 mmol/L with signs of poor tolerance (confusion, lethargy, coma, dehydration, electrocardiogram changes, acute renal failure, etc.), and who received a symptomatic treatment before surgery. Non‐inclusion criteria were chronic severe renal failure, heart failure, pregnancy, lactation, and other causes of hypercalcaemia.

The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism was established in the presence of hypercalcaemia with elevated or inappropriately normal parathormone (PTH) concentration.

A total of 65 patients were enrolled in this study. Demographic, clinical (anthropometric parameters, hydration state, neurological signs, blood pressure, cardiac rate, and diuresis), and baseline biochemical (serum calcium, serum phosphate, albumin, urea, creatinine, PTH, and 25 OH‐vitamin D levels) data were collected. The albumin‐corrected calcaemia was calculated in patients with albuminaemia levels < 40 g/L according to the following formula: total calcaemia (mmol/L) + 0.02 × (40 − albuminaemia [g/L]). Creatinine clearance was estimated using the MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) equation. Renal failure was defined as a creatinine clearance of < 60 ml/min and severe renal failure by a creatinine clearance of < 30 ml/min.

Cervical ultrasound, technetium‐99m sestamibi scintigraphy, cervicothoracic computed tomography scan, renal ultrasound, and bone mineral densitometry results were recorded.

The dose and the duration of each therapeutic agent prescribed (saline hydration, furosemide, and zoledronic acid) were noted in each patient. The infusion rate of saline hydration was adjusted according to the patient's age and comorbidities, hydration status, and serum calcium levels. Furosemide was administrated after proper hydration by saline solution with adequate control and supplementation of electrolytes. Intravenous zoledronic acid was used in patients whose calcium levels remained ≥ 3 mmol/L, despite appropriate saline hydration alone or with furosemide administration.

The efficacy of each therapeutic agent was evaluated according to the variation in serum calcium level calculated as Δ calcium = calcium level before the administration of each therapy –minimal calcium level after. Normalization of serum calcium was defined by a level of < 2.6 mmol/L.

### Pamidronate disodium [^747e215b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Hypercalcemia of Malignancy

Consideration should be given to the severity of as well as the symptoms of hypercalcemia. Vigorous saline hydration alone may be sufficient for treating mild, asymptomatic hypercalcemia.

Overhydration should be avoided in patients who have potential for cardiac failure. In hypercalcemia associated with hematologic malignancies, the use of glucocorticoid therapy may be helpful.

Moderate Hypercalcemia

The recommended dose of pamidronate disodium in moderate hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium* of approximately 12 to 13.5 mg/dL) is 60 to 90 mg given as a SINGLE DOSE, intravenous infusion over 2 to 24 hours. Longer infusions (i.e., > 2 hours) may reduce the risk for renal toxicity, particularly in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency.

Severe Hypercalcemia

The recommended dose of pamidronate disodium in severe hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium* > 13.5 mg/dL) is 90 mg given as a SINGLE DOSE, intravenous infusion over 2 to 24 hours. Longer infusions (i.e., > 2 hours) may reduce the risk for renal toxicity, particularly in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency.

Treatment regimens for hypercalcemia of malignancy — intravenous bisphosphonates include pamidronate and zoledronic acid. Pamidronate is given 60 to 90 mg IV over 2 to 24 hours and can be repeated every 2 to 3 weeks; effects last 7 to 14 days and may last 2 to 4 weeks, and it normalizes calcium in 60% to 70% of patients, with adverse events including acute-phase response, hypocalcemia, possible renal insufficiency if decreased glomerular filtration rate, and rare atypical femoral fractures/ONJ. Zoledronic acid is dosed 3 to 4 mg IV over 15 to 30 minutes, can be repeated in 7 days if desirable calcium level not achieved and every 3 to 4 weeks thereafter, yields 4 to 6 weeks of effect and normalizes calcium in 80% to 90% of patients, but may cause kidney damage especially if glomerular filtration rate < 30 to 35 mL/ minute and requires dose adjustment if glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min with administration over 30 to 60 minutes.

### Management of severe hypercalcaemia secondary to primary hyperparathyroidism: the efficacy of saline hydration, furosemide, and zoledronic acid [^2c9fd5ef]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

In our study, calcaemia did not reach normal ranges in any patient after furosemide administration but increased in 63% of the cases. The mean increase in calcaemia was 0.09 ± 0.21 mmol/L. Furthermore, the use of diuretics can induce metabolic complications such as hypokalaemia, hypophosphataemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypernatraemia, and metabolic acidosis. Thus, appropriate monitoring and supplementation of these disorders are necessary.

In addition to the general measures, therapeutic agents that act on the main pathophysiological mechanism of hypercalcaemia which is the increased bone resorption should be prescribed in patients with persistent severe hypercalcaemia. Bisphosphonates are natural analogs of pyrophosphates that bind to hydroxyapatite and act on osteoclasts by inhibiting their function and reducing their viability. Oral bisphosphonates are poorly absorbed, with 1% or less of the administered dose being taken up. Thus, intravenous bisphosphonates are recommended in the management of severe hypercalcaemia. The use of bisphosphonates in the treatment of malignant hypercalcaemia is well established. Intravenous infusion of pamidronate normalizes serum calcium for several days to weeks in 70%–100% of patients, although its onset of action is delayed for 1 ± 2 days. However, few published studies dealt with the use of bisphosphonates in hyperparathyroid crises. Han et al.in a study including 14 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism complicated by hypercalcaemia crisis, reported that serum total calcium levels decreased from 3.85 ± 0.50 mmol/L to 2.86 ± 0.39 mmol/L in 1.4 ± 0.6 days after intravenous bisphosphonates. Serum calcium levels were kept below 3.50 mmol/L for 10.1 ± 8.5 days. Authors showed the absence of a significant difference in the magnitude of decrease in serum calcium levels among the patients treated either with pamidronate, ibandronate, or zoledronic acid. In the study by Phitayakorn et al.including eight patients with hyperparathyroid crisis, six patients were treated with 60–90 mg of intravenous pamidronate, and one patient was treated with 4 mg of zoledronic acid. Isotonic sodium chloride and furosemide, in combination with intravenous bisphosphonates, resulted in a calcium decrease from 4.05 ± 0.40 to 2.95 ± 0.40 mmol/L.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) is considered an oncologic emergency associated with significant symptom burden and increased comorbid conditions and mortality. Underlying pathologic processes most often stimulate osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Although long-term control of HCM depends on effective management of the underlying cancer, temporizing management strategies for acute and/or symptomatic HCM include hydration and antiresorptive bone-modifying agents. Although most patients respond well to the antiresorptive therapies available, further investigation into other agents for those who are refractory to both bisphosphonates and denosumab is needed.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy is one of the most common metabolic disorders in patients with cancer and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This narrative review summarizes pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic strategies, and therapies available for the management of hypercalcemia of malignancy in acutely ill adult patients.

Recent Findings

We reviewed both classic and recent literature to provide practical recommendations for managing cancer-related hypercalcemia. Our findings are presented in the context of recently published societal guidelines. Timely identification and treatment of acute hypercalcemia of malignancy is vital. Understanding of the underlying disease processes and available therapies is needed to optimize patient care and healthcare resource utilization.

4 DISCUSSION

Our findings demonstrated a significant decrease in serum calcium levels with hydration and bisphosphonates. Meanwhile, a significant increase in serum calcium levels was observed after the use of furosemide and was significantly and positively correlated with the increase in serum creatinine level.

Hypercalcaemia may result from three possible mechanisms: increased renal tubular calcium reabsorption, stimulation of osteoclast‐mediated bone resorption, and increased renal synthesis of 1.25 (OH)2D3, which in turn promotes enhanced intestinal calcium absorption. Primary hyperparathyroidism represents one of the most frequent causes of hypercalcaemia. Severe hypercalcaemia defined by a total calcaemia greater than 3.5 mmol/L (14 mg/dl) or greater than 3 mmol/L (12 mg/dl) with signs of poor tolerance, is a life‐threatening condition.

Dehydration is a constant complication of severe hypercalcaemia. It results from polyuria and digestive disorders. It may contribute to the increase in the serum calcium level by reducing calcium clearance. Therefore, the cornerstone of initial management of severe hypercalcaemia consists of restoring extracellular volume with 0.9% normal saline solution. The objective of this measure is to restore blood volume and to re‐establish normal renal function in case of acute renal failure. Several mechanisms can explain the decrease in the calcaemia level with intravenous saline load: the release of hemoconcentration, the enhancement of calcium excretion by increasing glomerular filtration, and the calciuretic effect of sodium chloride leading to the decrease in the tubular reabsorption of calcium. The rate of fluid to infuse is based on the degree of hypercalcaemia, the severity of dehydration, the patient's age, and the associated comorbidities, in particular cardiac and renal failure. An initial flow of 200 to 300 ml/h is needed and subsequently adjusted to maintain a urine output of 100 to 150 ml/h. The recommended regimen is to administer 4–6 litres of isotonic saline daily in patients without heart or renal failure. Strict monitoring is indicated during saline hydration because of the risk of fluid overload and hypokalaemia.

### A case of resistant hypercalcemia of malignancy with a proposed treatment algorithm [^81609c8c]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To report and describe a case of refractory hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) associated with metastatic, transitional-cell carcinoma of the left ureter.

Case Summary

A 71-year-old male complaining of generalized weakness and night sweats for the past 3 months was sent to the emergency department when routine laboratory tests revealed a corrected serum calcium concentration of 14.4 mg/dL. Intravenous crystalloid fluids and pamidronate were administered with achievement of normocalcemia, and the patient was discharged. Computed tomography scan and liver biopsy revealed recurrent transitional-cell carcinoma with extensive liver metastasis. The patient returned approximately 1 week after discharge with a serum calcium level of 13.9 mg/dL. An initial decrease in serum calcium was observed with intravenous fluids, pamidronate, and calcitonin, but the normalization slowed and reversed within 3 days. Normocalcemia was achieved upon administration of zoledronic acid and the patient was discharged on day 14. The patient died 1 week after discharge from complications unrelated to hypercalcemia.

Discussion

Hypercalcemia is common in patients with malignancy and is associated with potentially life-threatening sequelae. Four mechanisms of HCM have been recognized thus far, with ectopic tumor production of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) being the leading cause. Treatment of HCM revolves around 2 principles: treatment of the underlying malignancy along with reduction of the serum calcium level. Evidence-based therapies for management include: intravenous crystalloid fluids with or without loop diuretics, bisphosphonates, calcitonin, gallium nitrate, and corticosteroids. Therapies used for this patient included aggressive hydration, calcitonin, and 3 distinct treatment courses of intravenous bisphosphonates with varying success. Other potential agents were explored for use in the event of continued hypercalcemia. These therapies remain viable options based on individual patient factors. To our knowledge, no published guidelines or algorithms exist for choosing between additional modalities in the treatment of refractory HCM.

Conclusions

For patients with HCM who do not achieve a response from bisphosphonates, or for those who need repeated dosing more often than expected, changing to a different drug class could be an alternative. The specific mechanism of hypercalcemia should be considered when developing a treatment regimen for patients who have had a suboptimal response to initial therapy with bisphosphonates. Multiple treatment modalities exist for the treatment of hypercalcemia, each with a different mechanism of action. As with the treatment of other disease states, we can use this knowledge to more specifically target the mechanism of the patient's disease.

### Treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy [^b858989b]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

The treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) consists of enhancing renal calcium excretion, mostly through hydration with isotonic fluids and the use of antiresorptive therapies. Intravenous zoledronic acid is currently the first-line treatment. Subcutaneous denosumab is used for bisphosphonate-refractory hypercalcemia and in patients with renal failure. There is no evidence that bisphosphonates prevent the occurrence of HCM. Conversely, denosumab, compared with zoledronic acid, is associated with a lower risk of HCM, both first episode and recurrence, in patients with breast cancer and multiple myeloma.

### Is there a dose response relationship for clodronate in the treatment of tumour induced hypercalcaemia? [^014f9642]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Patients were randomised to receive a single dose of clodronate by intravenous infusion in 500 mL normal saline over 3–4 h according to post-hydration corrected serum calcium. Patients with a corrected calcium level of: (1) 2.6–3.0 mmol l −1 were randomised to either 600, 900 or 1200 mg clodronate; (2) 3.0–3.4 mmol l −1 were randomised to 900, 1200 or 1500 mg; (3) 3.5–3.9 mmol l −1 were randomised to 1200 or 1500 mg; and (4) ⩾4.0 mmol l −1 were prescribed 1500 mg. Intravenous fluids were continued, at the discretion of the attending physician, until the patient was able to drink adequately. Serum levels of calcium, albumin, urea and electrolytes and liver function tests were recorded at days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9. All biochemical investigations were performed using standard automated techniques. Patients were continually assessed for adverse effects. Primary response was defined as achievement of normocalcaemia (corrected serum calcium ≤ 2.6 mmol l −1) at days 6–9. Secondary endpoints recorded included the time to relapse and survival following treatment of hypercalcaemia. Patients failing to achieve normocalcaemia at days 6–9 were withdrawn from the study and given further treatment at the discretion of the physician in charge.

Statistical methods

This study set out to test whether the effect seen in the study bycould be replicated. Randomisation to all dose groups irrespective of initial serum calcium was not considered ethical, so the best compromise between an observational and randomised study was used. The sample size was such that its power to detect an effect of the same size as that of Thiebaud would have exceeded 80%. The Mann Whitney test for trend was used to test whether there was a trend in response rates across the four dose categories. The mean values presented are geometric means, i.e. they are back transformed means of the log transformed values.

### Bisphosphonates for cancer patients: why, how, and when? [^0aa29491]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates (BPs) are potent inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and it is well accepted that tumor cells in bone, especially breast cancer and myeloma cells, can stimulate osteoclast formation and activity leading to the release of growth factors or cytokines, which will further stimulate cancer cells' growth and their secretion of osteolytic factors. BPs are now the standard treatment for cancer hypercalcemia, for which a dose of 90 mg of pamidronate or 1500 mg of clodronate is recommended; the former compound is more potent and has a longer lasting effect. Repeated pamidronate infusions exert clinically relevant analgesic effects in more than half of patients with metastatic bone pain. Recent data suggest that non-responding patients should perhaps be treated with higher doses. The optimal dose actually remains to be defined, especially as it is thought that it is probably a function of the disease stage. Regular pamidronate infusions can also achieve a partial objective response according to conventional UICC criteria and they can almost double the objective response rate to chemotherapy. Lifelong administration of oral clodronate to patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone reduces the frequency of morbid skeletal events by more than one-fourth. Two double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials comparing monthly 90 mg pamidronate infusions to placebo infusions for 1–2 years in addition to hormone or chemotherapy in patients with at least one lytic bone metastasis have shown that the mean skeletal morbidity rate could be reduced by 30–40%. The results obtained with intravenous BPs are generally viewed as better than those obtained with oral clodronate. However, preference can be given to the oral route when BPs are started early in the process of metastatic bone disease in a patient receiving hormone therapy. According to the recently published ASCO guidelines, pamidronate 90 mg i.v. delivered over 2 h every 3–4 weeks can be recommended in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have imaging evidence of lytic destruction of bone and who are concurrently receiving systemic therapy with hormonal therapy or chemotherapy. Furthermore, the ASCO Panel considered it "reasonable" to start i.v. BPs in women with localized pain whose bone scans were abnormal and plain radiographs normal, but not when an abnormal bone scan is asymptomatic. The pertinence of these criteria is discussed below. Because BPs are providing supportive care, reducing the rate of skeletal morbidity but evidently not abolishing it, the criteria for stopping their administration have to be different from those used for classic antineoplastic drugs, and they should not be stopped when metastatic bone disease is progressing. However, criteria to determine whether and for how long an individual patient benefits from their administration are lacking. New biochemical markers of bone resorption might help identify those patients continuing to benefit from therapy. Even better results have been achieved in patients with multiple myeloma, and the general consensus is that BPs should be started as soon as the diagnosis of lytic disease is made in myeloma patients. On the other hand, data are scanty in prostate cancer, but large-scale trials with potent BPs are ongoing or planned in such patients. Similar results to those achieved with pamidronate have been obtained with monthly 6-mg infusions of the newer BP ibandronate in patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone. The tolerance of ibandronate could be better, and the drug has the potential to be administered as a 15- to 30-min infusion. Zoledronate can also be administered safely as a 15-min 4-mg infusion, and large scale phase III trials have just been completed. These newer BPs will simplify the current therapeutic schemes and improve the cost-effectiveness ratio; they also have the potential to improve the therapeutic efficacy, at least in patients with an aggressive osteolytic disease or when given as adjuvant therapy. For that matter, initial data with clodronate indicate that they have the potential to prevent the development of bone metastases, but the use of BPs in the adjuvant setting must still be viewed as experimental.

### Pamidronate disodium [^0f6f8d01]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a third multicenter, randomized, parallel double-blind trial, a group of 69 cancer patients with hypercalcemia was enrolled to receive 60 mg of pamidronate disodium as a 4- or 24-hour infusion, which was compared to a saline-treatment group. Patients who had a corrected serum calcium level of ≥ 12.0 mg/dL after 24 hours of saline hydration were eligible for this trial.

The mean baseline-corrected serum calcium levels for pamidronate disodium 60 mg 4-hour infusion, pamidronate disodium 60 mg 24-hour infusion, and saline infusion were 14.2 mg/dL, 13.7 mg/dL, and 13.7 mg/dL, respectively.

By Day 7 after initiation of treatment, 78%, 61%, and 22% of the patients had normal-corrected serum calcium levels for the 60 mg 4-hour infusion, 60 mg 24-hour infusion, and saline infusion, respectively. At Day 14, 39% of the patients in the pamidronate disodium 60 mg 4-hour infusion group and 26% of the patients in the pamidronate disodium 60 mg 24-hour infusion group had normal-corrected serum calcium levels or maintenance of a partial response.

For responders, the median duration of complete responses was 4 days and 6.5 days for pamidronate disodium 60 mg 4-hour infusion and pamidronate disodium 60 mg 24-hour infusion, respectively.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults — antiresorptive therapy recommendation and evidence: In adults with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM), we recommend treatment with an intravenous (IV) bisphosphonate (BP) or denosumab (Dmab) compared with management without an intravenous (IV) BP or Dmab (1⊕⊕⊕O). The panel notes that no clinical studies have directly compared the effectiveness of BPs vs Dmab for adults with HCM. In combined analyses of 4 placebo-controlled BP studies, 61.3% of BP-treated patients experienced resolution of HCM versus 27.5% with placebo (rate ratio [RR] 2.22; 95% CI 1.57 to 3.14). Mortality did not differ significantly (RR 1.52; 95% CI 0.91 to 2.53). Adverse events were more common with BP treatment (RR, 2.33; 95% CI 1.16 to 4.69), with the most common adverse events being fever, infusion site reactions, hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, nausea, diarrhea, and abnormal taste. Rebound HCM has been associated with Dmab discontinuation in patients with metastatic malignancies.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Clinical studies in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) showed that single-dose infusions of Zoledronic acid Injection are associated with decreases in serum calcium and phosphorus and increases in urinary calcium and phosphorus excretion.

Osteoclastic hyperactivity resulting in excessive bone resorption is the underlying pathophysiologic derangement in hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM, tumor-induced hypercalcemia) and metastatic bone disease. Excessive release of calcium into the blood as bone is resorbed results in polyuria and gastrointestinal disturbances, with progressive dehydration and decreasing glomerular filtration rate. This, in turn, results in increased renal resorption of calcium, setting up a cycle of worsening systemic hypercalcemia. Reducing excessive bone resorption and maintaining adequate fluid administration are, therefore, essential to the management of hypercalcemia of malignancy.

Patients who have hypercalcemia of malignancy can generally be divided into two groups according to the pathophysiologic mechanism involved: humoral hypercalcemia and hypercalcemia due to tumor invasion of bone. In humoral hypercalcemia, osteoclasts are activated and bone resorption is stimulated by factors such as parathyroid hormone-related protein, which are elaborated by the tumor and circulate systemically. Humoral hypercalcemia usually occurs in squamous cell malignancies of the lung or head and neck or in genitourinary tumors such as renal cell carcinoma or ovarian cancer. Skeletal metastases may be absent or minimal in these patients.

Extensive invasion of bone by tumor cells can also result in hypercalcemia due to local tumor products that stimulate bone resorption by osteoclasts. Tumors commonly associated with locally mediated hypercalcemia include breast cancer and multiple myeloma.

Total serum calcium levels in patients who have hypercalcemia of malignancy may not reflect the severity of hypercalcemia, since concomitant hypoalbuminemia is commonly present. Ideally, ionized calcium levels should be used to diagnose and follow hypercalcemic conditions; however, these are not commonly or rapidly available in many clinical situations. Therefore, adjustment of the total serum calcium value for differences in albumin levels (corrected serum calcium, CSC) is often used in place of measurement of ionized calcium; several nomograms are in use for this type of calculation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

2.1 Hypercalcemia of Malignancy

The maximum recommended dose of Zoledronic acid Injection in hypercalcemia of malignancy (albumin-corrected serum calcium greater than or equal to 12 mg/dL [3.0 mmol/L]) is 4 mg. The 4-mg dose must be given as a single-dose intravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes. Patients who receive Zoledronic acid Injection should have serum creatinine assessed prior to each treatment.

Dose adjustments of Zoledronic acid Injection are not necessary in treating patients for hypercalcemia of malignancy presenting with mild-to-moderate renal impairment prior to initiation of therapy (serum creatinine less than 400 µmol/L or less than 4.5 mg/dL).

Patients should be adequately rehydrated prior to administration of Zoledronic acid Injection [see Warnings And Precautions (5.2)].

Consideration should be given to the severity of, as well as the symptoms of, tumor-induced hypercalcemia when considering use of Zoledronic acid Injection. Vigorous saline hydration, an integral part of hypercalcemia therapy, should be initiated promptly and an attempt should be made to restore the urine output to about 2 L/day throughout treatment. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without loop diuretics). Patients should be hydrated adequately throughout the treatment, but overhydration, especially in those patients who have cardiac failure, must be avoided. Diuretic therapy should not be employed prior to correction of hypovolemia.

Retreatment with Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg may be considered if serum calcium does not return to normal or remain normal after initial treatment. It is recommended that a minimum of 7 days elapse before retreatment, to allow for full response to the initial dose. Renal function must be carefully monitored in all patients receiving Zoledronic acid Injection and serum creatinine must be assessed prior to retreatment with Zoledronic acid Injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Abstract

Introduction

Severe hypercalcaemia is a life‐threatening condition that should be managed urgently. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of saline hydration, furosemide, and zoledronic acid in the management of severe hypercalcaemia secondary to primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT).

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of the management of 65 patients with severe hypercalcaemia (≥ 3 mmol/L) secondary to PHPT. The efficacy of each therapeutic agent was evaluated according to the variation in serum calcium level calculated as Δ calcium = initial calcium level – minimal calcium level reached after the administration of each agent.

Results

The mean age of patients was 56.4 ± 13.8 years. At baseline, the mean total serum calcium level was 3.42 ± 0.40 mmol/L. After normal saline hydration, calcium level decreased from 3.25 ± 0.21 to 2.98 ± 0.2 mmol/L (p < 10 −3) in 3.1 ± 1.7 days. Normalization of calcium level did not occur in any patient. Furosemide was prescribed in 35 patients. It resulted in a serum calcium increase of 0.09 ± 0.21 mmol/L. Calcium levels did not reach the normal range in any patient. Forty‐five patients received intravenous zoledronic acid. The mean maximal reduction in serum calcium level was 0.57 ± 0.27 mmol/L (from 3.25 ± 0.26 mmol/L to 2.68 ± 0.22 mmol/L, p ‐value < 10 −3). Normalization of calcium levels occurred in 27 patients (60%).

Conclusions

Our results show the absence of a significant additional effect of furosemide on calcium levels in patients with severe hypercalcaemia secondary to PHPT when compared with the effect of saline hydration alone. However, zoledronic acid was more potent. Thus, appropriate normal saline hydration with immediate intravenous bisphosphonates infusion should be considered in the management of severe hypercalcaemia in patients with PHPT.

### Assessment and clinical course of hypocalcemia in critical illness [^a93bd5c0]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Our study is set apart from others in that many participants received intravenous calcium supplementation as part of a standard protocol. This was guided by adjusted rather than ionized calcium, allowing analysis of whether this practice affected the normalization of ionized calcium concentration and outcome. We found that the pattern of change over time and the proportion of hypocalcemic patients with a normal ionized calcium concentration by day 4 were not different between those who did and did not receive calcium supplementation. Our results suggest that calcium supplementation does not lead to a greater sustained increase in ionized calcium than occurs without supplementation. This is in keeping with previous reports suggesting that calcium supplementation does not increase ionized calcium concentrations in critical illness and that calcium concentrations cannot be corrected by calcium therapy alone. However, it needs to be taken into consideration that our study was retrospective and observational and hence lacks controlled intervention.

Normally, ionized calcium concentrations are tightly regulated and hypocalcemia can have profound adverse clinical effects. Furthermore, intravenous calcium has an important role in hemodynamic support. Interestingly, however, it has been shown that in sepsis and during treatment with catecholamines calcium is shifted into the cells, which may contribute to the hypocalcemia seen in the critically ill. Raised intracellular calcium concentrations have in turn been linked to the pathophysiology of sepsis. Giving additional parenteral calcium could therefore cause harm, a concept which is supported by experimental models of sepsis in which calcium administration was associated with higher mortality. In keeping with this, it has frequently been suggested that hypocalcemia is a marker of disease severity, rather than a contributor in itself, indicating therapy is unwarranted.

Despite this, the role of calcium replacement in hypocalcemic patients remains unclear and requires further study. The results of this investigation are limited as the study design was retrospective and purely observational, no controlled intervention was performed and not all confounders could be eliminated. In particular, some patients may have received calcium supplementation prior to admission to intensive care and the route of nutrition (enteral vs. parenteral) was not included in the analysis. Finally, although the overall sample size was large, the rarity of severe hypocalcemia renders the study underpowered to make conclusions in this subgroup.

1 INTRODUCTION

Severe hypercalcaemia in the setting of primary hyperparathyroidism is called hyperparathyroid crisis. Its incidence ranges from 1.6% to 6%. Presentations of hyperparathyroid crisis are heterogeneous including neurological alteration, dehydration, hypovolaemia, anorexia, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmia, impaired cardiac, and renal functions, and finally death if the condition is untreated. Thus, the parathyroid crisis should be managed urgently. Parathyroidectomy represents today its only curative treatment option. However, preoperative medical antihypercalcaemic therapy is warranted as a holding measure. It consists of intravenous saline hydration, a loop diuretic, intravenous administration of bisphosphonates, and calcimimetics. Data evaluating the efficacy of these treatments are very limited.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of saline hydration, furosemide, and zoledronic acid in the management of severe hypercalcaemia secondary to primary hyperparathyroidism.

5.1 Drugs with Same Active Ingredient or in the Same Drug Class

Zoledronic acid Injection contains the same active ingredient as found in Reclast®(zoledronic acid). Patients being treated with Zoledronic acid Injection should not be treated with Reclast or other bisphosphonates.

5.2 Hydration and Electrolyte Monitoring

Patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy must be adequately rehydrated prior to administration of Zoledronic acid Injection. Loop diuretics should not be used until the patient is adequately rehydrated and should be used with caution in combination with Zoledronic acid Injection in order to avoid hypocalcemia. Zoledronic acid Injection should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs.

Standard hypercalcemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium, as well as serum creatinine, should be carefully monitored following initiation of therapy with Zoledronic acid Injection. If hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or hypomagnesemia occur, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary.

5.3 Renal Impairment

Zoledronic acid Injection is excreted intact primarily via the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions, in particular renal adverse reactions, may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Safety and pharmacokinetic data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment and the risk of renal deterioration is increased [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Preexisting renal insufficiency and multiple cycles of Zoledronic acid Injection and other bisphosphonates are risk factors for subsequent renal deterioration with Zoledronic acid Injection. Factors predisposing to renal deterioration, such as dehydration or the use of other nephrotoxic drugs, should be identified and managed, if possible.

Zoledronic acid Injection treatment in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy with severe renal impairment should be considered only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 400 µmol/L or greater than 4.5 mg/dL were excluded.

Zoledronic acid Injection treatment is not recommended in patients with bone metastases with severe renal impairment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 265 µmol/L or greater than 3.0 mg/dL were excluded and there were only 8 of 564 patients treated with Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg by 15-minute infusion with a baseline creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL. Limited pharmacokinetic data exists in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Hypercalcemia complicates the course of 10%-30% of all patients with malignancies and can be a sign of very poor prognosis and advanced malignancy. Prompt recognition of the nonspecific signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia and institution of therapy can be lifesaving, affording the opportunity to address the underlying etiology. The mechanisms of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia generally fall into three categories: humoral hypercalcemia due to secreted factors (such as parathyroid-related hormone), local osteolysis due to tumor invasion of bone, and absorptive hypercalcemia due to excess vitamin D produced by malignancies. The mainstays of therapy for hypercalcemia are aggressive intravenous volume expansion with saline, bisphosphonate therapy, and perhaps loop diuretics. Adjunctive therapy may include calcitonin and corticosteroids. In refractory cases, gallium nitrate and perhaps denosumab are alternatives. In patients presenting with severe AKI, hemodialysis with a low-calcium bath can be effective. In most cases, therapy normalizes calcium levels and allows for palliation or curative therapy of the malignancy.

(Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence)". Practical dosing and adjuncts include: "Oral calcium carbonate is widely available without prescription, usually well tolerated, and a typical postoperative dose is 1–2 g, 2–3 times daily with prompt dose escalation as required for symptom relief (excess ingestion is readily excreted)". If symptoms persist with oral calcium, "oral calcitriol should also be initiated, at a typical dose of 0.25 to 0.5 mcg twice daily", and laboratory evaluation can guide management: "Phosphorus level can help to distinguish between bone hunger (normal PO4) and hypoparathyroidism (elevated PO4). Magnesium and 25-OH vitamin D levels should also be checked". For severe cases, infusion is preferred: "Intravenous boluses of calcium are not recommended due to their short-lived effect; infusions of calcium over several hours are more effective and preferred".

Introduction

Severe hypercalcaemia is a life-threatening condition that should be managed urgently. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of saline hydration, furosemide, and zoledronic acid in the management of severe hypercalcaemia secondary to primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT).

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of the management of 65 patients with severe hypercalcaemia (≥ 3mmol/L) secondary to PHPT. The efficacy of each therapeutic agent was evaluated according to the variation in serum calcium level calculated as Δ calcium = initial calcium level - minimal calcium level reached after the administration of each agent.

Results

The mean age of patients was 56.4 ± 13.8years. At baseline, the mean total serum calcium level was 3.42 ± 0.40mmol/L. After normal saline hydration, calcium level decreased from 3.25 ± 0.21 to 2.98 ± 0.2mmol/L (p < 10–3) in 3.1 ± 1.7days. Normalization of calcium level did not occur in any patient. Furosemide was prescribed in 35 patients. It resulted in a serum calcium increase of 0.09 ± 0.21mmol/L. Calcium levels did not reach the normal range in any patient. Forty-five patients received intravenous zoledronic acid. The mean maximal reduction in serum calcium level was 0.57 ± 0.27mmol/L (from 3.25 ± 0.26mmol/L to 2.68 ± 0.22mmol/L, p-value < 10–3). Normalization of calcium levels occurred in 27 patients (60%).

Conclusions

Our results show the absence of a significant additional effect of furosemide on calcium levels in patients with severe hypercalcaemia secondary to PHPT when compared with the effect of saline hydration alone. However, zoledronic acid was more potent. Thus, appropriate normal saline hydration with immediate intravenous bisphosphonates infusion should be considered in the management of severe hypercalcaemia in patients with PHPT.

### Safety and convenience of a 15-minute infusion of zoledronic acid [^4de6020e]. The Oncologist (2004). Low credibility.

Skeletal morbidity, including hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM), places a severe burden on patients with advanced cancers. Bisphosphonates effectively correct HCM and reduce skeletal morbidity in patients with bone metastases. However, with the widespread use of bisphosphonates, the safety and convenience of therapy are emerging concerns. The delivery of effective doses of early bisphosphonates required a lengthy 24-hour i.v. infusion protocol because of renal tolerability issues. The introduction of more potent bisphosphonates with superior tolerability profiles has allowed therapy to be safely delivered via shorter i.v. infusions. Intravenous therapy with etidronate, clodronate, pamidronate, ibandronate, and zoledronic acid has been used to treat HCM and skeletal complications in cancer patients. Of these therapies, zoledronic acid (which can be safely administered via a 15-minute i.v. infusion) is the most convenient and effective and has demonstrated an excellent safety profile with long-term use. Zoledronic acid has also received the broadest regulatory approval of any bisphosphonate and can be used to treat HCM or bone lesions secondary to multiple myeloma and a wide variety of solid tumors, including breast, prostate, and lung cancers. In addition to the patient preference for shorter infusion times, the 15-minute i.v. infusion protocol of zoledronic acid can provide benefits for infusion centers by potentially increasing patient throughput.

More than 90% of patients with hypercalcaemia of malignancy can be successfully treated with rehydration and bisphosphonates; however, some patients do not respond to or experience relapse on bisphosphonate therapy. Persistent or relapsed hypercalcaemia of malignancy remains a difficult complication to manage. Denosumab, a fully-human IgG2 monoclonal antibody against RANKL that disrupts signalling through RANK and prevents tumour-mediated activation of osteoclasts, has been shown to be effective for the treatment of patients with bisphosphonate-refractory hypercalcaemia. In a single-arm, open-label study, 33 patients with hypercalcaemia of malignancy despite recent bisphosphonate treatment received denosumab 120 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 29, and then every 4 weeks. In total, 64% of patients responded to denosumab treatment by day 10, with 36% of patients experiencing a complete response (Fig. 2 b). The results of this study formed the basis of the approval of denosumab for the treatment of bisphosphonate-refractory hypercalcaemia of malignancy in the USA, Australia, Canada, and Russia. Denosumab, therefore, offers a new treatment option for patients with persistent hypercalcaemia that does not respond to bisphosphonates or hypercalcaemia that relapses following bisphosphonate treatment.

### Treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^90bb7a27]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Adults with hypercalcemia due to parathyroid carcinoma — agent selection and sequencing: In adult patients with hypercalcemia due to parathyroid carcinoma, we suggest treatment with either a calcimimetic or an intravenous (IV) bisphosphonate (BP) or denosumab (Dmab). Depending on the clinical situation and severity of hypercalcemia, an IV BP or Dmab may be useful prior to calcimimetic initiation. In adults with mild hypercalcemia and related symptoms, we suggest starting therapy with calcimimetics; conversely, for adults with moderate to severe hypercalcemia and related symptoms, an IV BP or Dmab should be the initial therapy. This recommendation considers the more rapid onset of action of an IV BP or Dmab, and generally better tolerability profile than a calcimimetic (as adverse events are common with increasing calcimimetic doses). Surgery should be considered when feasible, once control of severe hypercalcemia has been achieved.

At admission to our department, the mean albumin‐corrected serum calcium level was 3.42 ± 0.40 mmol/L with extremes of 3 and 5.4 mmol/L. Twenty‐two patients had calcaemia ≥ 3.5 mmol/L and 43 patients had calcaemia ≥ 3 mmol/L with acute renal failure (n = 18), electrocardiogram changes (n = 17), neurological symptoms (n = 8).

The topographic evaluation concluded to a parathyroid nodule in 61 patients and parathyroid hyperplasia in four patients. Surgical treatment was indicated in all patients. A preoperative medical antihypercalcaemic therapy was prescribed to all patients. Treatment protocols are described in figure 1.

FIGURE 1
Description of the treatment protocols in the study population.

Two patients underwent haemodialysis at the emergency room before being transferred to our department. The indication of haemodialysis was life‐threatening hypercalcaemia with cardiac arrhythmia in the first patient and neurological complications in the second patient.

Medical treatment modalities and their results are shown in Table 2. Intravenous normal saline hydration was prescribed alone in all patients with an infusion of two to four litres per day for 3.1 ± 1.7 days. Forty‐four patients received 3–4 L/24 h and 21 patients received 2 L/24 h. Serum calcium levels decreased in all patients after hydration but did not reach normal levels. The mean Δ calcium was of 0.27 ± 0.14 mmol/L (extremes: 0.025–0.62 mmol/L). There was no significant difference between patients who received 2 L/24 h and those who received 3–4 L/24 h.

### Pamidronate disodium [^c58e4dd8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In all three trials, patients treated with pamidronate disodium had similar response rates in the presence or absence of bone metastases. Concomitant administration of furosemide did not affect response rates.

Thirty-two patients who had recurrent or refractory hypercalcemia of malignancy were given a second course of 60 mg of pamidronate disodium over a 4- or 24-hour period. Of these, 41% showed a complete response and 16% showed a partial response to the retreatment, and these responders had about a 3 mg/dL fall in mean-corrected serum calcium levels 7 days after retreatment.

In a fourth multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, 103 patients with cancer and hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium ≥ 12.0 mg/dL) received 90 mg of pamidronate disodium as a 2-hour infusion. The mean baseline corrected serum calcium was 14.0 mg/dL. Patients were not required to receive intravenous hydration prior to drug administration, but all subjects did receive at least 500 mL of intravenous saline hydration concomitantly with the pamidronate infusion. By Day 10 after drug infusion, 70% of patients had normal corrected serum calcium levels (< 10.8 mg/dL).

Paget's Disease

Paget's disease of bone (osteitis deformans) is an idiopathic disease characterized by chronic, focal areas of bone destruction complicated by concurrent excessive bone repair, affecting one or more bones. These changes result in thickened but weakened bones that may fracture or bend under stress. Signs and symptoms may be bone pain, deformity, fractures, neurological disorders resulting from cranial and spinal nerve entrapment and from spinal cord and brain stem compression, increased cardiac output to the involved bone, increased serum alkaline phosphatase levels (reflecting increased bone formation) and/or urine hydroxyproline excretion (reflecting increased bone resorption).

### Hypocalcaemia in patients with prostate cancer treated with a bisphosphonate or denosumab: prevention supports treatment completion [^c5dbd4a6]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Severe hypocalcaemia

For symptomatic or at-risk patients, or those possibly/probably non-compliant with oral calcium supplement, intravenous calcium should be administered if corrected serum calcium concentration falls below 1.9 mmol/l (ionized calcium < 1.0 mmol/l; i.e.g.rade ≥ 2). Asymptomatic patients with a corrected serum calcium below 1.9 mmol/l can rapidly become critically ill, and so it is important to treat and monitor these patients closely.

Intravenously administered calcium gluconate (10%) is preferred to calcium chloride, which is a strong irritant. It can be given as repeated 50–100 mL boluses in 5% dextrose or by continuous infusion. If calcium chloride is given, it should be administered via a central line to prevent irritation of veins. In order to avoid precipitation of calcium salts, phosphate and bicarbonate should not be infused with the calcium. Patients with severe hypocalcaemia should also receive oral calcium supplements (as described above) and vitamin D (e.g. 50,000 IU each week for 8 weeks or calcitriol 0.5–1 μg/day for patients with hypoparathyroidism) as needed. Treatment should be repeated until symptoms have subsided. It should be noted that hypocalcaemia can be prolonged, so continuous administration of a dilute solution of calcium for a few days may be required. Magnesium replacement should also be given (as described above) to those who are hypomagnesaemic. Cardiac monitoring during intravenous calcium administration is recommended because the rapid elevation of serum calcium concentration required to correct hypocalcaemia can result in cardiac arrhythmia.

### Treatment of extreme hypercalcaemia: the role of haemodialysis [^d27b1746]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe hypercalcaemia is a life-threatening disorder that may cause muscle flaccidity, acute kidney injury, brain dysfunction with obtundation or coma and eventually dangerous arrhythmia and cardiac arrest. Along with conservative treatment, haemodialysis is an additional option of treatment of severe refractory hypercalcaemia poorly responsive to medical management. Haemodialysis provides rapid correction of calcium level, especially in patients with renal failure or cardiac comorbidities, in whom hydration cannot be safely performed.

Table 4
Assessment of risk of acute renal failure and other complications

In general, serial physical and laboratory examinations are necessary to manage patients with ERM appropriately. In the acute phase, treatment should be aimed at preserving renal function and restoring metabolic derangements. Early and adequate volume replacement with isotonic sodium chloride solution 0.9% (no potassium-containing or lactate-containing solutions) may directly prevent renal injury by aiding clearance of toxic substances and increasing renal perfusion pressure. Volume expansion increases renal blood flow and, consequently, glomerular filtration and urination. A common goal of treatment is to achieve a urine output of 300 mL/hour. This may require infusion of intravenous fluids by 1–2 L/hour until urine output is stable. Intravenous fluid should preferably be continued until serum CK activity in plasma has declined to 1000 IU/L or below. In patients with little or no urine output despite aggressive hydration, profound acidosis or severe hyperkalaemia, consider peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis and consult a nephrologist. Aggressive hydration may not be appropriate in patients with other comorbidities such as heart failure. Furthermore, if kidney injury is already established, overly aggressive hydration in a patient with already established renal failure may lead to volume overload and pulmonary oedema.

Mannitol leads to an increase in blood flow and glomerular filtration, which reduces the obstruction by myoglobin casts. It must only be given after volume replacement and must be avoided in patients with oliguria. It is not routinely recommended, but may be administered if the target urine output cannot be achieved by other means. Loop diuretics have also been investigated, but published data are too limited to support recommending them routinely. Although not proven by randomised control trials, some experts recommend the addition of bicarbonate. Alkalisation of the urine (target pH 6.5) promotes myoglobulin washout and corrects the metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia. A recent systematic review has shown that sodium bicarbonate should only be administered to patients with systemic acidosis.

Monitoring for and treating rhabdomyolysis-related electrolyte abnormalities is an important part of managing patients with ERM. Hyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia and hyperuricaemia are common in patients with rhabdomyolysis, and should be treated with standard therapy. Although hypocalcaemia is common in early rhabdomyolysis, hypercalcaemia can occur later. Calcium supplementation should only be prescribed for patients with symptomatic hypocalcaemia or severe hyperkalaemia. More research is needed to determine whether allopurinol may be useful for preventing ERM and acute renal damage.

### Severe hypercalcemia in diabetic ketoacidosis: a case report [^3c81462b]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

He had significant hyperglycemia, requiring up to 0.2 units/kg/h of intravenous insulin. Severe metabolic acidosis persisted for 4 days. This was attributed to a combination of severe dehydration, combined ketoacidosis and lacticacidosis, and hyperchloremia (maximum chloride levels, 145 mmol/L). Other electrolyte imbalances included hypernatremia, hypophosphatemia, and hypermagnesemia. Creatinine kinase was moderately raised (maximum 1,497 IU/L) with myoglobinemia, suggesting rhabdomyolysis, and he developed moderate renal failure (maximum creatinine, 269 mmol/L). His urine output in the first 24 h on the PICU was 0.4 mL/kg/h.

Fluid was increased by 10%, but further rises in sodium levels and worsening renal function were noted. It was decided that dehydration was the key factor driving the hypercalcemia. Dehydration at presentation was reestimated at 10%. Fluid was changed to 4% dextrose with 0.18% saline and recalculated at maintenance plus 7.5% correction over 48 h. A furosemide infusion was commenced to maintain a urine output of 3–4 mL/kg/h. Adjunct intravenous hydrocortisone was added. Renal ultrasonography (day 2) excluded nephrocalcinosis. Bisphosphonate therapy was considered, but it was felt this would not address the underlying problems and was not without risk given the renal function.

The boy's blood glucose levels stabilized by day 3 (< 10 mol/L). Hypercalcemia, renal function, and hypernatremia normalized within a week. His serum calcium concentration 9 days after initial presentation was 2.46 mmol/L. He made a full recovery with no neurologic deficit.

DKA as a cause of severe hypercalcemia has not previously been described. Hypercalcemia in DKA is likely secondary to severe metabolic acidosis and insulin deficiency. Other DKA-related factors are IGF-1 deficiency and hyperglycemia. Potential factors in our case also include hypophosphatemia, rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure, and immobilization.

Management proved challenging, recognizing both the need for adequate fluid replacement to treat the hypercalcemia, and also the need for fluid restriction to manage the cerebral edema.

In conclusion, hypercalcemia in DKA requires prompt identification and treatment to avoid life-threatening complications. We recommend that calcium levels are checked routinely in all patients with DKA.

### Treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1d707950]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Endocrine Society guideline — hypercalcemia due to parathyroid carcinoma, inadequate control on a calcimimetic: In adult patients with hypercalcemia due to parathyroid carcinoma not adequately controlled despite treatment with a calcimimetic, we suggest the addition of an intravenous (IV) bisphosphonate (BP) or denosumab (Dmab) compared with management without an intravenous (IV) bisphosphonate (BP) or denosumab (Dmab). (2⊕OOO). Evidence cited includes that the retrospective study of Eremkina et al included 10 patients with severe or symptomatic hypercalcemia due to primary hyperparathyroidism, including 2 who had parathyroid carcinoma; five patients received cinacalcet (30 to 120 mg) prior to hospital admission without significant changes in S Ca levels; all 10 patients received a single dose of 60 mg Dmab in addition to isotonic saline, and 8 patients continued with cinacalcet at doses of 30 to 60 mg; normocalcemia was achieved in 4 patients (1 after 3 days, and 3 after 9 days). Additional considerations state that improved control of hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) with the addition of either an IV BP or Dmab to cinacalcet may result in a decrease in cinacalcet dosing or cinacalcet withdrawal, a superior risk/benefit ratio, and a decrease in hospitalization; Dmab is easier to administer (subcutaneous administration) with less need to monitor renal function, and the panel noted IV BPs may worsen renal function; in that context, Dmab would be favored in patients with HCM and underlying renal insufficiency; this recommendation is likely acceptable considering that the costs or undesirable effects in the short term would be outweighed by potential desirable effects (benefits) in the future.

### Ergocalciferol [^140f7486]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

The effects of administered vitamin D can persist for two or more months after cessation of treatment.

Hypervitaminosis D is characterized by:

Hypercalcemia with anorexia, nausea, weakness, weight loss, vague aches and stiffness, constipation, mental retardation, anemia, and mild acidosis.
Impairment of renal function with polyuria, nocturia, polydipsia, hypercalciuria, reversible azotemia, hypertension, nephrocalcinosis, generalized vascular calcification, or irreversible renal insufficiency which may result in death.
Widespread calcification of the soft tissues, including the heart, blood vessels, renal tubules, and lungs. Bone demineralization (osteoporosis) in adults occurs concomitantly.
Decline in the average rate of linear growth and increased mineralization of bones in infants and children (dwarfism).

The treatment of hypervitaminosis D with hypercalcemia consists in immediate withdrawal of the vitamin, a low calcium diet, generous intake of fluids, along with symptomatic and supportive treatment. Hypercalcemic crisis with dehydration, stupor, coma, and azotemia requires more vigorous treatment. The first step should be hydration of the patient. Intravenous saline may quickly and significantly increase urinary calcium excretion. A loop diuretic (furosemide or ethacrynic acid) may be given with the saline infusion to further increase renal calcium excretion. Other reported therapeutic measures include dialysis or the administration of citrates, sulfates, phosphates, corticosteroids, EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), and mithramycin via appropriate regimens. With appropriate therapy, recovery is the usual outcome when no permanent damage has occurred. Deaths via renal or cardiovascular failure have been reported.

The LD50in animals is unknown. The toxic oral dose of ergocalciferol in the dog is 4 mg/kg.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Ganite is indicated for the treatment of clearly symptomatic cancer-related hypercalcemia that has not responded to adequate hydration. In general, patients with a serum calcium (corrected for albumin) < 12 mg/dL would not be expected to be symptomatic. Mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia may be treated with conservative measures (i.e., saline hydration, with or without diuretics). In the treatment of cancer-related hypercalcemia, it is important first to establish adequate hydration, preferably with intravenous saline, in order to increase the renal excretion of calcium and correct dehydration caused by hypercalcemia.

METHODS

This was a partially, randomised, non-blinded study, comparing four doses of intravenous clodronate in patients admitted with TIH in a tertiary cancer centre. Local research and ethics committees approved the study protocol. Patients were eligible for the study if: (1) they were aged over 18 years; (2) had a non-haematological malignancy; (3) were willing and able to give written informed consent; and (4) had a corrected serum calcium level ⩾2.6 mmol l −1 after a minimum of 24 h rehydration with at least 2 l of intravenous normal saline. Patients excluded from the study included those with: (1) previous bisphosphonate treatment for hypercalcaemia; (2) hypercalcaemia as part of a 'flare' reaction to endocrine therapy; (3) a change in corticosteroid therapy in the previous 7 days; (4) intolerance of the initial volume load of rehydration; or (5) impaired renal function (serum creatinine ⩾1.5 times the upper limit of normal following rehydration). All demographic details, evidence of bone metastases and previous bisphosphonate treatment for bone pain were recorded for all patients. Calcium values were corrected for albumin using the formula, (corrected calcium = measured calcium+((40-serum albumin)×0.02)).

### Management of severe hypercalcaemia secondary to primary hyperparathyroidism: the efficacy of saline hydration, furosemide, and zoledronic acid [^a9677031]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Saline hydration alone is rarely sufficient to reach normal calcium levels in patients with severe hypercalcaemia. It is estimated that with saline hydration, the serum calcium concentration decreases by about 0.4 to 0.6 mmol/L. In our study, all patients had a decrease in serum calcium levels with a mean value of 0.27 ± 0.14 mmol/L (extremes: 0.025–0.62 mmol/L) after saline hydration. However, normalization of calcium levels did not occur in any patient.

Once the intravascular volume is restored to normal, loop diuretics can be used in patients with severe hypercalcaemia to obtain a further reduction of calcium levels and to prevent fluid overload. Furosemide is a potent natriuretic that increases calcium excretion by inhibiting calcium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Before the advent of bisphosphonates, furosemide was an attractive alternative in the management of severe hypercalcaemia. However, recent data do not support its routine use in the management of severe hypercalcaemia. Suki et al.in a study including eight patients with hypercalcaemia ranging between 3.07 and 4.6 mmol/L treated with intravenous furosemide, showed normalization of serum calcium levels in only three patients. The mean decrease in serum calcium was 0.085 mmol/L, ranging from 0.057 to 0.095 mmol/L. LeGrand et al.in a narrative review including 37 patients (39 treatment episodes) with hypercalcaemia treated with furosemide, reported calcium level normalization in 14 of 39 episodes. This normalization occurred quickly in 6 and 12 h only in two cases. The average of furosemide dosages used was 1120 mg over 24 h, with a dose range of 240–2400 mg, and the duration of the therapy varied between 6 h and 12 days. Lower furosemide doses (40–60 mg/day, orally) did not achieve normalization at 12 days. Based on these findings, LeGrand et al.concluded that furosemide should be relegated to the management of fluid overload. On the contrary, Robey et al.considered that furosemide remains an important tool in the management of severe hypercalcaemia. Its efficiency depends on adequate attention to volume status and fluid balance before and during furosemide administration.

### Endocrine society hypercalcemia of malignancy guidelines… [^d92d9ce7]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Symptoms range from fatigue, constipation, polyuria, and polydipsia with mild-to-moderate hypercalcemia to cognitive. dysfunction, kidney failure, and arrhythmias with rapidly rising calcium levels or severe hypercalcemia. 1 Pathophysiology followed by HCM can include production of parathyroid hormone–related peptides, bone metastases releasing osteoclast activating factors, and excess production of calcitriol. 2 Treatment of HCM begins with intravenous hydration, potent antiresorptive agents, and calcitonin for severe hypercalcemia. Of the 8 recommendations, 1 recommendation was rated as strong given the life-threatening nature of HCM, with the rest conditional.

All 8 were based on very low certainty of evidence due to limited prospective evidence and variation in study end points pertaining to outcomes relevant for HCM. For treatment of HCM, 4 placebo-controlled studies of IV saline hydration plus nonnitrogen containing BPs vs IV saline hydration alone showed higher rates of resolution of HCM. 3 However, the panel suggested that IV compared with oral BP would have a greater potential for efficacy based on its increased potency, as well as data from several case series. Intravenous fluids, calcitonin, IV BP, Dmab, corticosteroids, and cinacalcet form the cornerstone of treatment for HCM.

Intravenous fluids are effective, inexpensive, and easy to administer, although they may be associated with volume overload. Calcitonin has a limited role in severe hypercalcemia, and its administration should be limited to 48 to 72 hours due to the risk of tachyphylaxis.

TABLE 2
Modalities and results of medical treatment of severe hypercalcaemia.

In addition to saline hydration, furosemide was prescribed in 35 patients at a mean dose of 54.3 ± 20.3 mg/day (extremes: 40–120 mg/day) during 3.4 ± 2 days. It resulted in an increase in serum calcium level in 63% of cases, a decrease in 34%, and no change in 3% of cases. The mean Δ calcium was +0.09 ± 0.21 mmol/L. The increase in serum calcium level was positively correlated with the increase in serum creatinine level after furosemide administration (r = 0.462, p = 0.004). There was no correlation between the increase in serum calcium level and the dose of furosemide (r = −0.041; p = 0.815).

Forty‐five patients received intravenous zoledronic acid (4 mg). Serum calcium levels decreased in all patients and reached normal rates in 27 of them (60%). The mean Δ calcium was of 0.57 ± 0.27 mmol/L (extremes: 0.07–1.22). The mean duration required to reach the lowest level of calcium after bisphosphonates was 6 ± 3.9 days (extremes: 3–22 days).

Figure 2 represents the variations in serum calcium levels after hydration, furosemide, and zoledronic acid administration. Figure 3 shows the changes in serum calcium levels in patients receiving zoledronic acid and saline hydration with or without furosemide. Figure 4 shows the percentage of patients with normal, decreased, or increased calcium levels after each therapeutic agent.

Management of hypercalcemia

When parathyroid carcinoma has became widely metastatic and surgical options are exhausted, clinical management becomes a matter of controlling the hypercalcemia. Saline infusion and loop diuretics are often used, but in the majority of cases, drugs that inhibit bone resorption are needed. Potent intravenous bisphosphonates (pamidronate and zoledronate) may transiently control hypercalcemia, but patients frequently become refractory to them. Plicamicin is effective, but the response is transient, and repeated courses may be associated with toxicity. Octreotide, the long-acting somatostatin analog, has been reported to inhibit PTH secretion in two cases of metastatic parathyroid carcinoma.

Anti-PTH immunotherapy showed promise in two recent case reports. Dendritic cell immunotherapy may also be applicable to induce a T-cell immune response.

Adults with hypercalcemia due to parathyroid carcinoma — initial pharmacotherapy and sequencing are suggested as follows: In adult patients with hypercalcemia due to parathyroid carcinoma, we suggest treatment with either a calcimimetic or an intravenous (IV) bisphosphonate (BP) or denosumab (Dmab). (2⊕○○○) Depending on the clinical situation and severity of hypercalcemia, an IV BP or Dmab may be useful prior to calcimimetic initiation. In adults with mild HCM and related symptoms, we suggest starting therapy with calcimimetics; conversely, for adults with moderate to severe HCM and related symptoms, an IV BP or Dmab should be the initial therapy. In adult patients with parathyroid carcinoma, surgery should be considered when feasible, once control of severe HCM has been achieved; however, surgical considerations were outside of the scope of this guideline. This recommendation considers the more rapid onset of action of an IV BP or Dmab, and generally better tolerability profile than a calcimimetic (as adverse events are common with increasing calcimimetic doses).

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: finding the balance [^49e894cb]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment and prevention of hypocalcaemia

Hypocalcaemia in patients with cancer can have severe consequences, whether occurring with or without the use of inhibitors of bone resorption, but responds well to calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Furthermore, when treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption is required for the management of metastatic bone disease, hypocalcaemia can usually be prevented by identification and appropriate management of at-risk patients. Case reports and retrospective analyses have identified a number of risk factors associated with the development of hypocalcaemia in those receiving inhibitors of bone resorption; these include vitamin D deficiency, renal insufficiency, osteoblastic metastases, prostate cancer, and low baseline blood calcium levels (Table 2). It is therefore important that vitamin D and calcium levels are assessed and supplementation initiated before starting treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption. This evaluation is particularly important given the high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency among patients with metastatic cancer. Furthermore, all patients receiving inhibitors of bone resorption for the prevention of SREs should receive concomitant calcium and vitamin D supplementation; use of these supplements has been shown to lower the risk of developing hypocalcaemia by 27% and 40% in patients receiving zoledronic acid or denosumab, respectively. An interim analysis of an open-label observational study of treatment persistence in patients with cancer who were receiving denosumab to prevent SREs found that most patients (80%) received calcium and vitamin D supplementation at the start of denosumab treatment. Long-term follow-up persistence data, however, are not yet available. Previous reports suggest that adherence to calcium and vitamin D supplementation is low; patients should, therefore, be counselled on the importance of adequate calcium and vitamin D intake in order to improve adherence. Use of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active metabolite of vitamin D, might offer further advantages in the prevention and treatment of hypocalcaemia; however, trials are required to confirm this.

Although hypocalcaemia can occur at any time during treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption, studies show that it often develops soon after treatment initiation; within 7 days, in some cases. Therefore, careful monitoring of at-risk patients after starting treatment is important to enable quick detection and resolution of hypocalcaemia. At-risk patients should also be educated about the symptoms of hypocalcaemia and encouraged to report any indicative symptoms. If hypocalcaemia occurs while a patient is receiving inhibitors of bone resorption, additional calcium and vitamin D supplementation and further monitoring are advised. Delaying the administration of inhibitors of bone resorption because of hypocalcaemia is rarely necessary.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^585bc91b]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Endocrine and metabolic — calcium targets in pediatric septic shock: We were unable to issue a recommendation as to whether to target normal blood calcium levels in children with septic shock or sepsis-associated organ dysfunction; in practice, normal calcium levels are often targeted in children with septic shock requiring vasoactive infusion support, with 65% of panel members always or often, 20% sometimes, and only 15% rarely or never targeting normal calcium levels.
