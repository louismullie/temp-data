## Question

I have a 75 year old with high LDL. Should I start a statin?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 75-year-old with elevated LDL cholesterol should start a statin, and if so, how to choose the intensity and navigate uncertainties in primary prevention at this age. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this is primary or secondary prevention. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for statins in adults older than 75 years. Next, I will review guideline positions and how they differ. After that, I need to check the patient's LDL-C level and risk enhancers. Then, I should consider frailty, comorbidities, and life expectancy. I will also examine the role of coronary artery calcium scoring. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise recommendation with monitoring and follow-up, and I will double-check for any drug–drug interactions before concluding [^116TMavT] [^115wBqQf] [^1141vgD9].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. If the 75-year-old has established ASCVD, that is secondary prevention; if there is no prior ASCVD, this is primary prevention, and the evidentiary basis and intensity recommendations differ substantially in older adults, so I need to be precise here before moving forward [^113V14kD] [^116TMavT].

> Now, I should review the evidence base for statins in patients older than 75 years. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit across ages. Large meta-analyses show that LDL-C lowering reduces major vascular events by about 21% per 1 mmol/L reduction, with similar relative risk reductions in those older than 75 years compared with younger adults, although absolute benefit is greater due to higher baseline risk, and the proportional reduction appears smaller in primary prevention subgroups over 75, reflecting fewer events and less direct trial evidence in that stratum [^112PFeGW] [^113b99XE] [^112WJwcZ].

> Next, I should review guideline positions. The 2018 AHA/ACC guideline gives a Class IIb recommendation to consider a moderate-intensity statin for adults older than 75 years with LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL for primary prevention, emphasizing shared decision-making and evaluation of frailty and preferences, whereas the 2019 ACC/AHA primary prevention guideline focuses on adults 40–75 and defers to clinician–patient discussion for those older than 75, and the USPSTF issues an I statement for initiating statins at age 76 or older due to insufficient evidence, while the 2019 ESC/EAS guideline supports statins for primary prevention in high- and very high-risk patients older than 75 years, again with individualized assessment [^1141vgD9] [^116TMavT] [^114zkBRW] [^1146NCUt].

> Hold on, I should verify the LDL-C threshold and risk enhancers because that changes the calculus. If LDL-C is 190 mg/dL or higher, high-intensity statin is recommended regardless of calculated risk in adults up to age 75, and extrapolation to older adults is reasonable with caution; if LDL-C is 70–189 mg/dL, I should consider risk enhancers such as hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, smoking, family history of premature ASCVD, inflammatory conditions, or South Asian ancestry, and I should remember that traditional 10-year risk calculators often overestimate risk in very old adults, so I need to contextualize any risk score with geriatric factors [^111CzrrQ] [^116TMavT] [^112xvULD].

> I need to ensure I account for frailty, multimorbidity, and life expectancy. Let me consider validated mortality indices and functional status, because in adults older than 75 without ASCVD, the net benefit of statins depends on competing risks and remaining life expectancy; if there is limited life expectancy or significant frailty, the absolute risk reduction may be too small to justify therapy, and deprescribing may be appropriate in select cases after shared decision-making [^114e3yfX] [^115H7CKJ] [^114RZ5j1].

> But wait, what if uncertainty persists about primary prevention benefit in this specific 75-year-old. I should double-check the role of coronary artery calcium. In adults 76–80 with LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL, measuring CAC can refine risk; a CAC score of zero substantially lowers estimated risk and supports deferring statin therapy in the absence of diabetes, family history of premature CHD, or smoking, whereas CAC 1–99 or ≥ 100 favors statin initiation, acknowledging that CAC evidence is strongest in younger cohorts and extrapolated cautiously to older adults [^113AGTW2] [^112rpanz] [^112xvULD].

> Let me synthesize a practical recommendation. If this 75-year-old has established ASCVD, I should initiate at least moderate-intensity statin and consider high-intensity if tolerated, aiming for ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction when appropriate, consistent with secondary prevention guidance for older adults; if this is primary prevention with LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL, it is reasonable to initiate a moderate-intensity statin after a clinician–patient discussion that weighs expected absolute risk reduction, frailty, comorbidities, preferences, and potential drug interactions, with a typical starting option being atorvastatin 10–20 mg or rosuvastatin 5–10 mg, recognizing expected 30–49% LDL-C lowering with moderate intensity [^112nizyu] [^111Y7GK5] [^1156Tqa1].

> I should confirm monitoring and safety considerations. I will obtain baseline liver enzymes and follow symptoms for muscle complaints; in older adults, I will start at a moderate dose and titrate based on tolerance and LDL-C response, rechecking lipids in 4–12 weeks and then every 3–12 months as clinically indicated, while screening for drug–drug interactions that increase statin exposure, such as certain azoles, macrolides, gemfibrozil, or CYP3A4 inhibitors, and adjusting therapy accordingly [^116UieHV] [^115wBqQf].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the 2019 ACC/AHA primary prevention guideline endorsed routine statin use in all adults older than 75 with LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL, but that is not correct; I should correct that and emphasize that the 2019 guideline focuses on adults 40–75 and advises individualized decisions for those older than 75, whereas the 2018 AHA/ACC cholesterol guideline allows consideration of moderate-intensity statin in adults older than 75 with LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL as a Class IIb recommendation, reinforcing the need for shared decision-making rather than a blanket endorsement [^116TMavT] [^1141vgD9].

> Next, I should review alternatives if statins are not tolerated or declined. If there is statin intolerance, ezetimibe is a reasonable next step to lower LDL-C by an additional roughly 20–25%, and bempedoic acid can be considered in statin-intolerant patients, with the understanding that outcome data in adults older than 75 are limited and decisions should be individualized; in very high-risk secondary prevention contexts, adding ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor on top of maximally tolerated statin therapy may be reasonable after discussing benefit, safety, and cost [^115vtFC5] [^113zxkGf] [^1131uW9D].

> Final answer: Yes, a 75-year-old with elevated LDL cholesterol should generally be offered statin therapy if this is secondary prevention, using at least moderate intensity and considering high intensity if tolerated; if this is primary prevention with LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL, it is reasonable to initiate a moderate-intensity statin after shared decision-making that incorporates risk enhancers, frailty, comorbidities, life expectancy, and patient preferences, with CAC scoring considered if uncertainty remains and the patient is 76–80 years old, and with explicit plans to monitor for efficacy and tolerability and to reassess the ongoing net benefit over time [^112nizyu] [^1141vgD9] [^116TMavT] [^112xvULD].

In most 75-year-olds with high LDL, **statins are reasonable** for primary prevention if LDL-C is 70–189 mg/dL, using shared decision-making that weighs benefits, risks, and patient preferences [^1141vgD9] [^116TMavT]. For secondary prevention, **moderate- or high-intensity statins are indicated** unless contraindicated [^115vtFC5]. Evidence shows a **21–26% relative risk reduction** in major vascular events per 1 mmol/L LDL lowering in older adults, with greater absolute benefit due to higher baseline risk [^112PFeGW] [^113b99XE]. Use lower starting doses, monitor for muscle symptoms and drug interactions, and consider CAC scoring if uncertain [^113rBLp6] [^113ieaQq].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Primary prevention**: For adults > 75 years without ASCVD and LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL, initiating a moderate-intensity statin may be reasonable after clinician–patient risk discussion [^1141vgD9] [^116TMavT].

- **Secondary prevention**: For adults > 75 years with clinical ASCVD, initiate or continue moderate- or high-intensity statin based on expected benefit, comorbidities, and tolerability [^115vtFC5] [^111Y7GK5].

- **Shared decision-making**: Essential in older adults to incorporate life expectancy, frailty, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^113FQqSZ] [^114e3yfX].

---

## Evidence supporting statin therapy in elderly patients

- **Meta-analyses**: Statin therapy reduces major vascular events by ~21% per 1 mmol/L LDL-C reduction in older adults, with similar relative risk reductions across age groups [^113b99XE] [^112PFeGW].

- **Absolute benefit**: Greater in older adults due to higher baseline cardiovascular risk, resulting in lower number-needed-to-treat [^117G5m5e].

- **Safety**: No significant increase in adverse events, including cognitive impairment or cancer, in older adults [^113b99XE] [^11563kkW].

---

## Potential risks and considerations

- **Muscle symptoms**: Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) are the most common adverse effect, typically mild and reversible [^notfound].

- **Drug interactions**: Polypharmacy is common; monitor for interactions and adjust therapy as needed [^115wBqQf].

- **Frailty and comorbidities**: Consider functional status, frailty, and life expectancy when initiating or continuing therapy [^114e3yfX].

---

## Individualized patient assessment

- **Risk assessment**: Use validated tools and clinical judgment to estimate ASCVD risk, considering age-specific factors [^112xvULD].

- **Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring**: Consider CAC scoring in adults 76–80 years to refine risk assessment and guide therapy [^116uLEqR].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor LDL-C, liver enzymes, and renal function, and assess for adverse effects and adherence [^116UieHV].

---

## Alternative therapies

Consider **ezetimibe** for additional LDL-C lowering if statins are insufficient or not tolerated, and **PCSK9 inhibitors** for very high-risk patients who do not achieve LDL-C goals on maximally tolerated statin plus ezetimibe [^115MUVFk] [^112nizyu].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Statins are **appropriate for most 75-year-olds with high LDL**, with therapy individualized to risk, frailty, comorbidities, and preferences. For primary prevention, consider a moderate-intensity statin after shared decision-making; for secondary prevention, use moderate- or high-intensity statins unless contraindicated.

The incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular (CV)-related morbidity and mortality significantly increase with age. In the elderly, hypercholesterolemia with elevated total and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol is a significant predictor of incident and recurrent CV disease. Multiple lines of evidence have established the benefit of statin therapy to lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of CV events as well as prevent progression of subclinical atherosclerotic disease. Elderly patients, particularly those older than 75 years, have not been well represented in randomized clinical trials evaluating lipid lowering therapy. The limited available data from clinical trials do support the benefit of statin therapy in the elderly population. Based upon these data, cholesterol treatment guidelines endorse statin therapy as the primary treatment of hypercholesterolemia in elderly patients, though caution is recommended given the greater number of co-morbid conditions and concern for poly-pharmacy common in the elderly. Additional research is needed to better establish the benefit of statin therapy in the elderly within the context of reducing CV risk, minimizing side effects, and improving overall quality of life.

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) on statin therapy for secondary prevention — initiation and intensity guidance: High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated in adults aged ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD who are not receiving statin therapy, or increased from low or moderate intensity; when high intensity is contraindicated or adverse-effect risk is present, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be used as the second option, if tolerated, with an objective of a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C for moderate intensity and ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction for high intensity. For individuals aged > 75 years, evidence supports continuation of statin therapy in those already taking and tolerating it, data support the use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals with clinical ASCVD aged > 75 years, and it is reasonable to consider initiation of high-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals aged > 75 years with decisions based on expected benefit and competing comorbidities. Patients with clinical ASCVD are defined from RCT inclusion criteria and subgroups include those at very high risk, those not at very high risk, and those with baseline LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

Recommendations for adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy are as follows: "In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), statin therapy reduces risk of ASCVD, and in the context of a risk discussion, if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended". Targets are specified: "In intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more", and "in patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more". Diabetes-specific guidance states: "In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated", and "In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more". For very high LDL-C, "In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended".

### Efficacy and safety of lowering LDL cholesterol in older patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112PFeGW]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

The clinical benefit of LDL cholesterol lowering treatment in older patients remains debated. We aimed to summarise the evidence of LDL cholesterol lowering therapies in older patients.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE and Embase for articles published between March 1, 2015, and Aug 14, 2020, without any language restrictions. We included randomised controlled trials of cardiovascular outcomes of an LDL cholesterol-lowering drug recommended by the 2018 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines, with a median follow-up of at least 2 years and data on older patients (aged ≥ 75 years). We excluded trials that exclusively enrolled participants with heart failure or on dialysis because guidelines do not recommend lipid-lowering therapy in such patients who do not have another indication. We extracted data for older patients using a standardised data form for aggregated study-level data. We meta-analysed the risk ratio (RR) for major vascular events (a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or other acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or coronary revascularisation) per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol.

Findings

Data from six articles were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, which included 24 trials from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis plus five individual trials. Among 244090 patients from 29 trials, 21492 (8.8%) were aged at least 75 years, of whom 11750 (54.7%) were from statin trials, 6209 (28.9%) from ezetimibe trials, and 3533 (16.4%) from PCSK9 inhibitor trials. Median follow-up ranged from 2.2 years to 6.0 years. LDL cholesterol lowering significantly reduced the risk of major vascular events (n = 3519) in older patients by 26% per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol (RR 0.74 [95% CI 0.61–0.89]; p = 0.0019), with no statistically significant difference with the risk reduction in patients younger than 75 years (0.85 [0.78–0.92]; p interaction = 0.37). Among older patients, RRs were not statistically different for statin (0.82 [0.73–0.91]) and non-statin treatment (0.67 [0.47–0.95]; p interaction = 0.64). The benefit of LDL cholesterol lowering in older patients was observed for each component of the composite, including cardiovascular death (0.85 [0.74–0.98]), myocardial infarction (0.80 [0.71–0.90]), stroke (0.73 [0.61–0.87]), and coronary revascularisation (0.80 [0.66–0.96]).

Interpretation

In patients aged 75 years and older, lipid lowering was as effective in reducing cardiovascular events as it was in patients younger than 75 years. These results should strengthen guideline recommendations for the use of lipid-lowering therapies, including non-statin treatment, in older patients.

Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Statin effects on LDL-C and events in older adults are summarized from observational and trial data: LDL-C response to low to moderate-intensity statins was slightly greater (2–5% depending on statin and dose) among adults without ASCVD older than 75 years compared to those aged ≤ 50, and differences with high-intensity therapy were minimal. Over a median follow-up of 2.5 years, major vascular event reduction per 1 mmol/L LDL-C reduction showed adjusted HR 0.76, 0.73, 0.81, 0.81, and 0.77 across age groups with no differences by age. Among individuals without ASCVD up to age 75 in randomized statin trials, the average time to benefit was 2.5 years. Across 28 major statin trials (n = 186,854), only 8% were over age 75 and only 2% of primary prevention participants were over age 75.

National Lipid Association and American Geriatrics Society — Question 6 (statin therapy strategies for adults older than 75 years without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [ASCVD]) states that, in those treated with statins, ongoing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) monitoring every 3 to 12 months as clinically indicated is recommended (I A), and that shared decision making should be used for patient-centered decisions regarding statin therapy (I C-EO).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Secondary ASCVD prevention — In patients who are 75 years of age or younger with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), high-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 50% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels; if high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or leads to statin-associated side effects, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are judged to be very high risk and considered for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, maximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy should include maximally tolerated statin therapy and ezetimibe. For very high risk patients on maximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy with LDL-C 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) or a non-HDL-C level of 100 mg/dL or higher (≥ 2.6 mmol/L), it is reasonable to add a PCSK9 inhibitor following a clinician-patient discussion about the net benefit, safety, and cost, and in those on maximally tolerated statin therapy who are judged to be at very high risk and have an LDL-C level of 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) it is reasonable to add ezetimibe therapy. At mid-2018 list prices, PCSK9 inhibitors have a low cost value (> $150,000 per QALY) compared to good cost value (< $50,000 per QALY). In patients older than 75 years of age with clinical ASCVD, it is reasonable to initiate moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy after evaluation of the potential for ASCVD risk reduction, adverse effects, and drug-drug interactions, as well as patient frailty and preferences, and in those older than 75 years who are tolerating high-intensity statin therapy, it is reasonable to continue high-intensity statin therapy after similar evaluation. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy and whose LDL-C level remains 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe therapy, and in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction attributable to ischemic heart disease who have a reasonable life expectancy (3 to 5 years) and are not already on a statin because of ASCVD, clinicians may consider initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy to reduce the occurrence of ASCVD events.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

AHA/ACC 2018 cholesterol guideline — risk stratification and LDL-C reduction targets in primary prevention specify that adults 40 to 75 years can be classified as borderline risk (10-year ASCVD risk 5% to < 7.5%), intermediate-risk (7.5% to < 20%), and high-risk (≥ 20%); for intermediate-risk patients, moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy should be considered, and if a statin is given, LDL-C should be reduced by ≥ 30% and optimally by ≥ 50%. When uncertainty exists, CAC scoring is especially useful in older adults, and a CAC score of zero revises ASCVD risk downward and selects adults who show reduced benefit from starting a statin.

Secondary prevention — atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD): In patients who are 75 years of age or younger with clinical ASCVD, high-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 50% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels; if high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or causes statin-associated side effects, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels.

Managing hypercholesterolemia in primary prevention patients older than 75 years — statin decision-making, alternatives, and monitoring are outlined with recommendation classes for patients with LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL: use shared decision-making to make patient-centered decisions regarding the use of statin therapy (Class I); validated mortality indexes that include comorbid conditions and functional status are recommended (Class I); if aged 76–80 years old, it is reasonable to measure coronary artery calcium, and if there is uncertainty whether to treat, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy if the CAC score is 0 (Class IIa); consider using models adjusted for competing risks to estimate ASCVD risk and the potential benefit of statin therapy (Class IIb); when shared decision-making supports treatment, initiation of a statin may be reasonable in those without a life limiting illness (Class IIb); when treated with statin therapy, ongoing monitoring of LDL-C every 3 to 12 months as clinically indicated is recommended (Class I); in select adults in whom statin deprescribing is considered, shared decision-making between clinician, patient, and/or caregiver is reasonable (Class IIa); when an alternative to statin therapy is needed, if LDL-C is above desirable levels and additional risk factors are present, consider ezetimibe for reduction of LDL-C and ASCVD risk (Class IIb), and if statin intolerance is present, consider bempedoic acid for reduction of LDL-C and ASCVD risk (Class IIb).

Statins in adults older than 75 years — A participant-level meta-analysis of 28 RCTs (median duration 4.9 years) including 186 854 participants (including 14 483 older than 75 years at randomization) found a significant 21% RR reduction in major vascular events per every 1.0 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C in adults older than 75 years at randomization. This RR reduction did not differ among the 6 subgroups by age (≤ 55, 56 to 60, 61 to 65, 66 to 70, 71 to 75, and > 75 years). These data suggest a benefit in continuing statin therapy in adults over the age of 75 who have an intermediate or high risk of ASCVD, and support consideration of using a moderate intensity statin at a lower dose, or a low intensity statin.

ASCVD risk assessment and CAC use in adults older than 75 years without established ASCVD — In adults older than 75 years, the utility of traditional risk equations to assess 5 or 10-year risk of ASCVD is uncertain (IIb B-NR), and clinicians may consider using models adjusted for competing risks to estimate ASCVD risk and the potential benefit of primary prevention statin therapy for an individual patient (IIb B-NR). In adults aged 76–80 years with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 70–189 mg/dL in whom there is clinical uncertainty about starting statin therapy, it may be reasonable to measure coronary artery calcium (CAC) and to withhold statin therapy if the CAC score is 0 (IIa B-NR).

The risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease increases with advancing age. Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL)-cholesterol levels remain predictive of incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular events among individuals older than 75 years. Risk prediction among older individuals is less certain because most current risk calculators lack specificity in those older than 75 years and do not adjust for co-morbidities, functional status, frailty, and cognition which significantly impact prognosis in this age group. Data on the benefits and risks of lowering LDL-cholesterol with statins in older patients without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease are also limited since most primary prevention trials have included mostly younger patients. Available data suggest that statin therapy in older primary prevention patients may reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular events and that benefits from lipid-lowering with statins outweigh potential risks such as statin-associated muscle symptoms and incident type 2 diabetes mellitus. While some evidence suggests the possibility that statins may be associated with incident cognitive impairment in older adults, a preponderance of literature indicates neutral or even protective statin-related cognitive effects. Shared decision-making which is recommended for all patients when considering statin therapy is particularly important in older patients. Randomized clinical trial data evaluating the use of non-statin lipid-lowering therapy in older patients are sparse. Deprescribing of lipid-lowering agents may be appropriate for select patients older than 75 years with life-limiting diseases. Finally, a patient-centered approach should be taken when considering primary prevention strategies for older adults.

Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Managing hypercholesterolemia in adults older than 75 years without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) — the abstract notes that the risk of ASCVD increases with age, that elevated LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol remain predictive of events among individuals older than 75 years, and that risk prediction is less certain because current calculators lack specificity and do not adjust for key geriatric factors. In older primary prevention patients without ASCVD, data on benefits and risks of LDL-cholesterol lowering with statins are limited since most trials included younger patients, yet available data suggest statin therapy may reduce events and that benefits from statin lipid-lowering outweigh potential risks such as statin-associated muscle symptoms and incident Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Regarding cognition, while some evidence suggests a possible association between statins and incident cognitive impairment in older adults, a preponderance of literature indicates neutral or even protective statin-related cognitive effects. Shared decision-making, which is recommended for all patients when considering statin therapy, is particularly important in older patients, and randomized clinical trial data on non-statin lipid-lowering therapy in older patients are sparse.

Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

The risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease increases with advancing age. Elevated LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol levels remain predictive of incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular events among individuals older than 75years. Risk prediction among older individuals is less certain because most current risk calculators lack specificity in those older than 75years and do not adjust for co-morbidities, functional status, frailty, and cognition which significantly impact prognosis in this age group. Data on the benefits and risks of lowering LDL-cholesterol with statins in older patients without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease are also limited since most primary prevention trials have included mostly younger patients. Available data suggest that statin therapy in older primary prevention patients may reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular events and that benefits from lipid-lowering with statins outweigh potential risks such as statin-associated muscle symptoms and incident Type 2 diabetes mellitus. While some evidence suggests the possibility that statins may be associated with incident cognitive impairment in older adults, a preponderance of literature indicates neutral or even protective statin-related cognitive effects. Shared decision-making which is recommended for all patients when considering statin therapy is particularly important in older patients. Randomized clinical trial data evaluating the use of non-statin lipid-lowering therapy in older patients are sparse. Deprescribing of lipid-lowering agents may be appropriate for select patients older than 75years with life-limiting diseases. Finally, a patient-centered approach should be taken when considering primary prevention strategies for older adults.

### Evaluation and treatment of older patients with hypercholesterolemia: a clinical review [^114st4NK]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hypercholesterolemia is common among people older than 80 years. Substantial functional heterogeneity exists among older patients, and decision making for statin use differs in older patients relative to younger ones.

Objective

To discuss the presentation, modifying factors, and treatment of hypercholesterolemia (usually with statins) among persons older than 80 years.

Evidence Review

MEDLINE and other sources were searched from January 1990 to June 2014. Personal libraries and a hand search of reference lists from guidelines and reviews from January 2000 to June 2014 were also used.

Findings

No randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of statin or any other hypocholesterolemic medication included persons older than 80 years at baseline. Findings from 75- to 80-year-old patients enrolled in RCTs and information from observational studies support statin treatment for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and probably in patients with diabetes without ASCVD. Harms from statin drugs are not increased in older patients, so the use of these agents for primary prevention is possible. Because people older than 80 years are biologically heterogeneous with varying life expectancy, may have frailty or comorbid conditions, and may take multiple medications, the decision to treat with statins must be individualized.

Conclusions and Relevance

Ideally, treatment of hypercholesterolemia for patients at risk of ASCVD should start before they turn 80 years old. No RCT evidence exists to guide statin initiation after age 80 years. Decisions to use statins in older individuals are made individually and are not supported by high-quality evidence.

Secondary prevention — ASCVD not at very high-risk: High-intensity statin (Goal: ↓ LDL-C ≥ 50%) (Class I) is recommended, and if high-intensity statin not tolerated, use moderate-intensity statin (Class I). If on maximal statin therapy and LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L), adding ezetimibe may be reasonable (Class IIb). For older adults, initiation of moderate- or high-intensity statin is reasonable (Class IIa), and continuation of high-intensity statin is reasonable (Class IIa); in patients > 75 years of age with ASCVD, potential benefits versus adverse effects of statin therapy should be considered before initiation of statin therapy.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Synopsis — overall ASCVD management approach: Clinical ASCVD encompasses ACS, those with history of MI, stable or unstable angina or coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, TIA or PAD including aortic aneurysm, all of atherosclerotic origin. As a primary recommendation, high-intensity statin therapy is indicated for clinical ASCVD, but if this cannot be used, moderate-intensity statin therapy can be initiated. The first goal is to achieve a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C levels, and if LDL-C levels remain ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) on maximally tolerated statin therapy, adding ezetimibe may be reasonable. In patients > 75 years of age with ASCVD, potential benefits versus adverse effects of statin therapy should be considered before initiation of statin therapy.

### Statins in the elderly: a patient-focused approach [^111WV3E3]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Individuals age > 65 years represent the fastest-growing subpopulation in the United States. Although these individuals with the highest cardiovascular risk profile would be anticipated to be the most aggressively treated, paradoxically, treatment and baseline risk are inversely related. Presumably, the elderly population would benefit from high-intensity statin therapy; however, as per the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, given the scarcity of evidence in patients age > 75, there are only sufficient data from randomized controlled trials to support use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention. Despite evidence demonstrating statins are beneficial in the elderly, the decision to initiate and sustain treatment should be a well-informed and collaborative decision. One must balance the benefits (secondary atherosclerotic cardiovascular prevention, stroke reduction, decreased morbidity and mortality) with the potential risks to the elderly (altered metabolism, comorbidities, polypharmacy and drug-drug interactions, side effects, cognitive limitations, and cost).

The scarcity of explicit evidence on lowering LDL‐C to prevent primary ASCVD in the elderly has led to remarkably heterogeneous recommendations among 5 major guidelines of statin treatment. Although the 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Cholesterol Guidelines suggested that risk assessment and statin use may be considered in adults aged ≥ 75 years with a class IIb recommendation, the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Primary Prevention Guidelines withdrew from approving statin therapy in a similar age group. The 2016 US Preventive Services Task Force also opposed statin use for people aged ≥ 75 years. Contrarily, the recent Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines in 2021 and 2019 European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society Guidelines supported maintaining low cholesterol levels regardless of age. The 2014 UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Guidelines further strongly emphasized the reduction of cholesterol up to age 84 years and still with a class IIa recommendation in people aged ≥ 85 years. This obvious variation of guidance extends to disorganized cholesterol management for the elderly in actual practice.

### Are statins indicated in senior citizens? A review of statin therapy in the elderly [^113vETxB]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The use of statin therapy in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) has demonstrated substantial improvement in morbidity and mortality of the aging population. Despite exhaustive studies demonstrating the benefits of statin therapy linking lower cholesterol levels to decreased vascular events, statin guidelines vary greatly with age, and recommendations are unclear regarding initiation and discontinuation of statin therapy in patients 65 years and older. Data suggest that statins are highly effective at secondary prevention of major cardiovascular events and development of coronary heart disease in patients with a history of vascular disease or risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or smoking. Therefore, patients who meet these criteria, regardless of age, should begin statin therapy. There is also some evidence to suggest that statin therapy may be beneficial in primary prevention of major cardiovascular events, although these data are not as well studied as secondary prevention use of statin therapy, and should therefore be individualized for each patient.

### Statinopause [^115kh8SZ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Statins are the cornerstone of lipid-lowering therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention. The 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines represent a fundamental shift in how statins will be prescribed. The new guidelines recommend statins for nearly all older patients up to age 75 years, including healthy adults with low normal lipid levels and no atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors other than age. Under the 2013 guidelines, age becomes a main determinant for initiating statin therapy for primary prevention among older adults. Specifically, according to the new guidelines, white males aged 63–75, white females aged 71–75, African American males aged 66–75, and African American females aged 70–75 with optimal risk factors would be recommended for statin treatment for primary prevention. Based on the new guidelines, one could term these older adults as having "statin deficiency", a condition warranting statin treatment. We call this putative condition of age-related statin deficiency "statinopause". After careful examination of the trial evidence, we find very little support for the new recommendations for primary prevention. The lack of evidence underscores the need for clinical trials to determine the risks and benefits of statin therapy for primary prevention among older adults.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in older adults and ezetimibe add-on — It is reasonable to consider continuation of high-intensity therapy in patients > 75 years of age with ASCVD if they are tolerating the statin and have a low risk of competing morbidities. It may be reasonable to add ezetimibe to moderate-intensity therapy in patients with ASCVD for whom high-intensity therapy is indicated but cannot be used, provided their LDL-C level remains ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) on moderate-intensity therapy; the same reasoning holds for any patient whose LDL-C level remains ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) on maximally tolerated statin therapy.

Other major guideline documents — older patients: The 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline includes different treatment regimens for individuals > 75 years of age compared to younger persons, recommending moderate intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in those > 75 years versus high intensity in younger individuals, using the Pooled Cohort Risk Equations and provider–patient discussion for primary prevention without a specific intensity recommendation for those > 75 years. The International Atherosclerosis Society recommends for persons > 65 years the use of short-term (10-year) Framingham risk scoring (recalibrated for country) to estimate CHD risk and elevation of the estimated value by 1/3 to estimate total ASCVD risk, suggesting statins for moderately-high or high estimated risk while considering polypharmacy, drug–drug interactions, and cost. The European Atherosclerosis Society/European Society of Cardiology advocate secondary prevention in the same manner as in younger patients (class I, level of evidence B), starting at low dosage and titrating to the same targets (class I, level of evidence C), and recommend primary prevention for those with 1 or more additional risk factors aside from age (class IIb, level of evidence B). The Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommends statins without specific upper age cutoffs for secondary prevention and, for primary prevention, 10-year Framingham scoring for men ages 40–75 years and for women ages 50–75 years.

Cardiovascular events after discontinuation of statin therapy

Some studies have tried to specifically address the value of statins in the elderly population. The PROSPER (Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk) trialevaluated the effect of pravastatin 40 mg on the risk of cardiovascular events in people aged 70–82 years (mean age 75 years). In the primary prevention subgroup of 3239 patients, statin therapy did not significantly reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease and stroke vs. placebo.

Based on data from the JUPITER (Justification for Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) trial, comparing Rosuvastatin 20 mg vs. placebo in patients with no history of cardiovascular disease and high C-reactive protein and low low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, subgroup analysis in the 5695 participants aged 70 years or older (median age 74 years) showed a significant reduction of cardiovascular events (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46–0.82), but not all-cause mortality (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62–1.04).

The meta-analysis of primary prevention by Savarese et al.based on eight trials including 24 674 people over the age of 65 years with a mean age of 73 years concluded that statins vs. placebo significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction by 39.4% (95% CI 15.3–56.6%) and the risk of stroke by 23.8% (95% CI 7.4–37.4%), but statins did not provide any significant benefit on the risk of cardiovascular or all-cause mortality.

The recent meta-analysis by the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration, based on 28 trials, included a subgroup of 6449 primary prevention patients older than 75 years. Within this subgroup, cardiovascular incidence rates of 2.7 and 2.8 per 100 patient-years were found for the patient groups 'statin or more intensive treatment' and 'controls or less intensive treatment', respectively, corresponding to a rate ratio per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol of 0.92 (95% CI 0.73–1.16).

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines recently published its 2018 recommendations on management of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) in people with diabetes. For primary prevention, moderate-intensity statin therapy is recommended for those aged 40–75 years, with a preference for high-intensity statin treatment for older subjects and for those with higher estimated risk or risk-enhancing factors following a patient-clinician discussion. Statin therapy may be reasonable in adults < 40 years or > 75 years of age where there is less evidence for benefit. For people with diabetes and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, high-intensity statin therapy is recommended. The majority of these subjects have very high risk, and an LDL-C goal of < 70 mg/dL is recommended. If this target is not achieved, ezetimibe and/or a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor may be added.

Introduction

The use of statin therapy for secondary prevention has been clearly established in all age groups. However, the role for statin therapy in primary prevention in the elderly remains a subject of debate, with little evidence for or against its benefit.

The available evidence is mainly derived from subgroup and post hoc analyses of the data of randomized trials. The results of these analyses in elderly individuals treated for primary prevention are inconsistent in terms of the effect on cardiovascular morbidity, while most studies reported a non-significant effect of statin therapy on all-cause mortality. Two relevant interventional studies have recently been launched, but their findings are expected only after 2020.

Consequently, the European guidelines on the management of dyslipidaemias and on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice, respectively, provide no recommendation for or against statin use for primary prevention in persons older than 75 years and the 2018 American College of Cardiology–American Heart Association (ACC-AHA) guidelines simply recommend a shared decision-making process between clinicians and these patients that targets individualized decisions, with regular reassessments over time. However, for older adults with a coronary artery calcium (CAC) score of 0, the likelihood of benefits from statin therapy does not outweigh the risks, according to the ACC-AHA guidelines. The three guidelines underline that in older patients lipid-lowering medication should be started at a lower dose than in younger subjects.

A particularly relevant practical question is whether existing statin therapy can be stopped in older people with no history of cardiovascular disease. This issue currently concerns a large proportion of the population over the age of 75 years as well as large numbers of people under the age of 75 years currently taking evidence-based treatment with statins and reaching ages for which only limited evidence of efficacy is available. None of the above mentioned guidelines provide specific recommendations for statin discontinuation for primary prevention in persons older than 75 years, except in older adults with severe age-related management complexities. To the best of our knowledge, no study has evaluated the impact of discontinuing primary prevention with statin therapy in older people.

We therefore conducted a study to assess the effect of statin discontinuation on cardiovascular outcomes in patients who turned 75 in 2012–14, previously adherent to statin therapy for at least 2 years with no history of cardiovascular disease, using the French healthcare databases.

### Primary prevention statins in older adults: personalized care for a heterogeneous population [^115ijWzk]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on the management of cholesterol acknowledge a lack of robust randomized clinical trial data to support routine use of statin therapy for primary prevention in adults older than 75years. Shared decision making is emphasized because potential recommendations should reflect limitations of the current data, as well as heterogeneity of the older adult population, spanning the robust to the most frail. Although the National Institute on Aging recently funded PRagmatic EValuation of EvENTs And Benefits of Lipid-Lowering in OldEr Adults (PREVENTABLE), a trial to study benefits of statins in very old adults, data are not anticipated for 5years. Thus interim guidance is essential. Furthermore, even when PREVENTABLE is completed, individual idiosyncrasies among older adults suggest that decisions for each patient will still need to be personalized, relative to their unique clinical situation. In this article, we present three case studies to highlight dynamics that commonly impact choices regarding statins in older adults. Details underlying shared decision making are also described including the evolving application of coronary artery calcium to inform this practice. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:467–473, 2020.

Initiation of drug therapy — statin intensity and targets: Unless contraindicated, first-line drug therapy for treatment of elevated atherogenic cholesterol levels is a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and a moderate-intensity statin will generally lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 30% to < 50% and a high-intensity statin by ≥ 50%, although individual patient responses should be expected to vary considerably. Some clinicians prefer to start with a high-intensity statin and reduce the dosage if the patient experiences intolerance, while others prefer to start with a moderate-intensity statin and titrate upward if additional lowering of atherogenic cholesterol is desired; if drug therapy is used, the panel consensus view was that at least a 30% reduction in atherogenic cholesterol should be targeted. Some patients have contraindications for, or intolerance to, statin therapy, and for such patients, nonstatin drug therapy may be considered.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

ACC 2022 ECDP — Adults with diabetes without ASCVD and baseline LDL-C < 190 mg/dL on statin therapy for primary prevention: The guideline recommends that all adults aged 40–75 years with diabetes receive at least a moderate-intensity statin, and higher-risk subgroups (including reduced eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m² and ankle brachial index < 0.9) are potential candidates for high-intensity statin therapy. For the small proportion with 10-year predicted ASCVD risk < 7.5% and no additional high-risk features, moderate-intensity statin therapy with anticipated LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) reduction 30%-49% is supported; soluble dietary fiber and phytosterols may also be considered. Because elevated non-HDL-C (non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) is common in diabetes, non-HDL-C thresholds are important to consider. If, despite adherence to lifestyle recommendations and moderate-intensity statin therapy, patients have < 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL), consideration of intensification of therapy is indicated and routine clinical assessment and interventions are warranted. If the response reaches a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C < 130 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue current therapy. If still inadequate after these steps, the patient and clinician may consider increasing the statin dose to a high-intensity statin. If high-intensity statin therapy still results in inadequate percent LDL-C reduction or LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL), the clinician and patient should enter a discussion focused on adding a nonstatin; ezetimibe 10 mg daily may be considered as the initial nonstatin agent for most patients when additional LDL-C lowering is desired.

### Primary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention: optimally active, agile, and accountable [^111tuzpR]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) affects 24 million adults (1 in every 10) in the United States. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a main causal risk factor for ASCVD, such that there is an estimated 22% relative risk reduction of ASCVD events for every 39 mg/dL LDL-C lowering with statin therapy. Statins remain the foundation of ASCVD prevention and likely confer pleiotropic effects beyond lipid-lowering. Nonetheless, challenges remain with respect to the optimal implementation of guideline-directed approaches to statin initiation.

The 2018 Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol provides a Class I recommendation for the initiation of statin therapy for primary prevention in adults aged 40 to 75 years with type 2 diabetes or LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL as well as those with an intermediate risk (7.5–20%), or high risk (≥ 20%) based on the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) risk calculator. Among select adults with a borderline risk (5–7.5%) or all adults with an intermediate risk (7.5%-20%), there is a Class IIa recommendation to measure coronary artery calcium (CAC) to facilitate clinician-patient risk discussions regarding consideration of statin therapy for primary prevention. Measurement of CAC has been shown to help reclassify risk and better identify those most likely to derive net clinical benefit from statin therapy, as the 10-year number needed to treat to prevent 1 ASCVD event is more than 2-fold lower for statin-eligible candidates with incident CAC vs long-term absence of CAC.

Randomized controlled trials — limitations and knowledge gaps: The guideline notes that greater reductions of LDL-C are accompanied by greater reductions in risk of ASCVD and that most RCT data are with statin therapy, with limited add-on nonstatin data, leading to several priority questions including thresholds and indications for PCSK9 inhibitor use and statin intensity comparisons in primary prevention. Key statements include: "They have established that greater reductions of LDL-C are accompanied by greater reductions in risk of ASCVD"; "Most of the data from RCTs have been obtained with statin therapy"; and questions such as "In secondary prevention, does a lower limit for LDL-C attainment exist, beyond which the incremental benefit attained is worth neither the risks nor the cost of additional therapy?", "In secondary prevention, what are the indications for adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy?", "In primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L]) with or without diabetes mellitus, what is the incremental risk reduction imparted by high-intensity statins as compared with moderate-intensity statins?", "In primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L]) with or without diabetes mellitus, what is the incremental risk reduction imparted by moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe as compared with moderate-intensity statins alone?", and "Is statin therapy efficacious and safe in older patients (> 75 years of age)?".

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^117XuUuN]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

NLA dyslipidemia recommendations — atherogenic cholesterol lowering and ASCVD risk: For statin therapy, every 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduced major vascular events by 22% (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.76–0.80; P < .001) after approximately 5 years; reductions in LDL-C of 77.4 and 116.1 mg/dL would be expected to reduce the risk of a major vascular event by 40% and 53%, respectively. Over approximately 5 years, each 1% reduction in LDL-C or non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is associated with an approximately 1% reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) event risk. With high intensity statin therapy, the best average LDL-C reduction (~50%) would be associated with ~50% reduction in CHD events or ~40% reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events assuming a mean untreated LDL-C of 150 mg/dL and a 75 mg/dL reduction. Lifelong genetic evidence suggests that ASCVD risk reduction per 1% atherogenic cholesterol lowering may be greater, with reductions of ~3% per 1% lower LDL-C concentration over decades.

### Starting primary prevention earlier with statins [^113mhgJf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was based on a systematic review of randomized trials with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes and meta-analyses of these trials published through 2011. With evidence of an ASCVD risk reduction benefit greatly outweighing the potential for adverse effects, the guideline recommends statin therapy for primary prevention in those with ≥ 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk and consideration of statin therapy in those with 5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk. Subsequent meta-analyses of the statin trials support these recommendations and have additionally found a reduction in total mortality in lower-risk subjects. Additional evidence from imaging trials and epidemiologic studies suggests that initiation of statin therapy earlier in the course of ASCVD could have the potential to more effectively prevent age-related progression of atherosclerosis. Given the high levels of suboptimal risk factors in adults and the safety and availability of low-cost generic statins, a consideration of all the available evidence strongly supports earlier intervention for the primary prevention of ASCVD. In conclusion, earlier initiation of statin therapy has the potential to have a large long-term impact on the heavy burden of cardiovascular disease in the aging populations.

### Treat-to-target or high-intensity statin treatment in older adults with coronary artery disease: a post hoc analysis of the LODESTAR trial [^114wkEeP]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal statin treatment strategy that is balanced for both efficacy and safety has not been clearly determined in older adults with coronary artery disease (CAD).

Methods

In the post hoc analysis of the LODESTAR (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-targeting statin therapy versus intensity-based statin therapy in patients with coronary artery disease) trial, the impact between a treat-to-target strategy versus a high-intensity statin therapy strategy was compared in older adults (aged 75 years or older). The goal of treat-to-target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level was 50–70 mg/dl. The primary endpoint comprised the three-year composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke or coronary revascularisation.

Results

Among 4,400 patients with CAD enrolled in the LODESTAR trial, 822 (18.7%) were aged 75 years or older. Poor clinical outcomes and risk factors for atherosclerosis were more frequently observed in older adults than in younger population (< 75 years old). Among these older adults with CAD, the prescription rate of high-intensity statin was significantly lower in the treat-to-target strategy group throughout the study period (P < 0.001). The mean LDL-C level for three years was 65 ± 16 mg/dl in the treat-to-target strategy group and 64 ± 18 mg/dl in the high-intensity statin group (P = 0.34). The incidence of primary endpoint occurrence was 10.9% in the treat-to-target strategy group and 12.0% in the high-intensity statin group (hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.61–1.38, P = 0.69).

Conclusions

High-intensity statin therapy is theoretically more necessary in older adults because of worse clinical outcomes and greater number of risk factors for atherosclerosis. However, the primary endpoint occurrence with a treat-to-target strategy with an LDL-C goal of 50–70 mg/dl was comparable to that of high-intensity statin therapy and reduced utilisation of a high-intensity statin. Taking efficacy as well as safety into account, adopting a tailored approach may be considered for this high-risk population.

ACC/AHA primary prevention — risk-based statin therapy and coronary artery calcium (CAC) use in adults: For age 40–75 y with LDL-C 70–190 mg/dL without diabetes mellitus, a 10-year ASCVD risk discussion is initiated and actions align with risk strata: < 5% "Low Risk" emphasizes lifestyle (Class I); 5% - < 7.5% "Borderline Risk" considers moderate-intensity statin if risk enhancers are present (Class IIb); ≥ 7.5% - < 20% "Intermediate Risk" favors initiating moderate-intensity statin to reduce LDL-C by 30% - 49% (Class I); and ≥ 20% "High Risk" initiates statin to reduce LDL-C ≥ 50% (Class I). When risk decision is uncertain, CAC = zero lowers risk and clinicians may consider no statin unless diabetes, family history of premature CHD, or cigarette smoking are present; CAC = 1–99 favors statin (especially after age 55); CAC = 100+ and/or ≥ 75th percentile indicates statin therapy. Additional branches specify LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL warrants high-intensity statin without risk assessment (Class I), diabetes mellitus age 40–75 y warrants moderate-intensity statin (Class I) with risk assessment to consider high-intensity statin (Class IIa), and age > 75 y requires clinical assessment and risk discussion.

### Cardiovascular effect of discontinuing statins for primary prevention at the age of 75 years: a nationwide population-based cohort study in France [^116xxvE6]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The results of this study suggest potential cardiovascular risk reduction associated with continuing statin therapy after the age of 75 years in persons already taking these drugs for primary prevention. However, due to the observational nature of this study, residual confounding cannot be excluded. Future studies, including interventional randomized studies, are needed to confirm these findings and support updating and clarification of guidelines on the use of statins for primary prevention in the elderly.

### Prevention of cardiovascular disease: highlights for the clinician of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines [^113e2uhq]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Prevention of cardiovascular disease, undoubtedly an emphasis of clinical care in 2014, will provide both opportunities and challenges to patients and their healthcare providers. The recently-released ACC/AHA guidelines on assessment of cardiovascular risk, lifestyle management to reduce cardiovascular risk, management of overweight and obesity, and treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk, have introduced new concepts and revised prior conventional strategies. New to risk assessment are the Pooled Cohort Equations, targeting the expanded concept of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and focusing not solely on mortality but as well on major nonfatal events. The lifestyle management focuses on diet and physical activity for lipid and blood pressure control. The cholesterol guideline identifies four high-risk groups with the greatest benefits from statin therapy: preexisting ASCVD, primary LDL-C elevations ≥ 190 mm/dl, those 45–75 years with diabetes and LDL-C 70–189 mm/dl without clinical ASCVD, and those 40–75 years without clinical ASCVD with an LDL-C 70–189 mg/dl with a 7.5% or greater 10-year ASCVD risk. Eliminated are arbitrary LDL-C treatment targets, with individual patient risk status guiding who should take statins and the appropriate intensity of statin drugs. Patient-physician discussions of individual benefits and risks are paramount. Management of high blood pressure remains controversial, with two different expert panels offering varying treatment targets; there is general agreement on a < 140/90 mmHg goal, but substantial disagreement on blood pressure targets for older adults. Clinicians and their patients deserve a well-researched concensus document.

### Association of statin use in older people primary prevention group with risk of cardiovascular events and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^111yBric]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of mortality worldwide. More than 80% of the overall CVD death occurs in older people (aged ≥ 65 years). In 2015, people aged ≥ 65 years represented 8.5% (617.1 million) of the global population (7.3 billion). In 2030, this percentage is projected to reach 12% (1 billion) of the world population. In Europe, it is projected that almost 25% of its population will be aged ≥ 65 years by 2030, higher than any of the other continents. Therefore, efforts at the prevention of CVD in older people are important and will influence global healthcare policies.

The consideration of statins for primary CVD prevention in older people represents a dilemma in clinical practice unlike the secondary prevention, which is well-established and supported by a level (A) evidence, according to the most recent European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) guidelines. Current evidence on the use of statins for primary prevention of CVD in older people (especially those aged > 75 years) is still lacking. Statin therapy for primary prevention in people aged > 75 years (at high risk) was supported by level (B) evidence and considered as a class IIb recommendation in the 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines on dyslipidemias. The 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines advocate statins for primary prevention in older people aged ≤ 75 years (i.e. 65 to 75 years) as a class I recommendation, which is unlike the 2016 guidelines with a class ΙΙa recommendation and level (B) evidence. This change in recommendation class was based on an individual participant level-meta-analysis from 28 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by the "Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration" that reported a significant 39% proportional reduction [rate ratio (RR) 0.61; 99% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.73] in major vascular events for every 1 mmol/L drop in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by statins (or more intensive statin therapy) in participants without vascular disease, aged > 65 and ≤ 70 years. This beneficial effect of statins was statistically insignificant for primary prevention in participants aged > 70 years.

Question 5 — adults older than 75 years without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) assesses expected net benefit of statin therapy as follows: In adults older than 75 years without established ASCVD, validated mortality indexes that include noncardiac conditions and functional status are recommended to help clinicians incorporate the patient's remaining life expectancy into decision making about statin therapy for ASCVD prevention (COR 1, LOE B-NR). In adults older than 75 years without established ASCVD, integrating screening for frailty, dementia, and functional impairment into decisions about initiating statin therapy for primary prevention of ASCVD can be useful (COR IIa, LOE B-NR).

Supporting evidence includes a meta-analysis of "61 prospective studies" where risk "remained statistically significant to 80–89 years", and the Copenhagen General Study of "91,311 participants" (including "10,591 participants were 70–79 years old and 3,188 participants were 80–100 years old") in which "Higher LDL-C was predictive of incident MI and ASCVD independent of age". Adjusted hazard ratios were "highest in the youngest (20–49 year-old) age group (MI HRadj 1.47 (95% CI 1.45–1.87); ASCVD HRadj 1.47 (95% CI 1.32–1.64))" and "lowest in the oldest (80–100 year-old) age group (MI HRadj 1.26 (95% CI 1.08–1.52); ASCVD HRadj 1.16 (95% CI 1.05–1.29))". Based on observational estimates for treatment effect per "every 1 mmol/L (38.67 mg/dL) lowering of LDL-C in each of the 5 years", numbers needed to treat were "42" vs "345" for ASCVD in ages "80–100" vs "50–59", and "80" vs "439" for MI, respectively.

Thresholds for consideration of drug therapy — risk-based initiation: Because of available inexpensive, generic statins with favorable safety and demonstrated efficacy, the NLA Expert Panel consensus view is that risk thresholds for initiating drug treatment should be lowered as compared with the NCEP ATP III but raised as compared with ACC/AHA 2013 recommendations; based on the ACC/AHA 2013 guidelines, most men > 60 years of age and most women > 70 years of age would be eligible for statin therapy, and recommendations involve a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity. Some clinicians may prefer to prescribe drug therapy to patients with lower levels of risk or atherogenic cholesterol, and such an approach may be considered based on clinical judgment and patient preferences in light of primary prevention randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showing risk reduction at projected 10-year ASCVD event rates as low as approximately 5% to 7.5%.

### Efficacy and safety of statin therapy in older people: a meta-analysis of individual participant data from 28 randomised controlled trials [^113b99XE]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Statin therapy has been shown to reduce major vascular events and vascular mortality in a wide range of individuals, but there is uncertainty about its efficacy and safety among older people. We undertook a meta-analysis of data from all large statin trials to compare the effects of statin therapy at different ages.

Methods

In this meta-analysis, randomised trials of statin therapy were eligible if they aimed to recruit at least 1000 participants with a scheduled treatment duration of at least 2 years. We analysed individual participant data from 22 trials (n = 134 537) and detailed summary data from one trial (n = 12 705) of statin therapy versus control, plus individual participant data from five trials of more intensive versus less intensive statin therapy (n = 39 612). We subdivided participants into six age groups (55 years or younger, 56–60 years, 61–65 years, 66–70 years, 71–75 years, and older than 75 years). We estimated effects on major vascular events (ie, major coronary events, strokes, and coronary revascularisations), cause-specific mortality, and cancer incidence as the rate ratio (RR) per 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol. We compared proportional risk reductions in different age subgroups by use of standard χ² tests for heterogeneity when there were two groups, or trend when there were more than two groups.

Findings

14 483 (8%) of 186 854 participants in the 28 trials were older than 75 years at randomisation, and the median follow-up duration was 4.9 years. Overall, statin therapy or a more intensive statin regimen produced a 21% (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.77–0.81) proportional reduction in major vascular events per 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol. We observed a significant reduction in major vascular events in all age groups. Although proportional reductions in major vascular events diminished slightly with age, this trend was not statistically significant (p trend = 0.06). Overall, statin or more intensive therapy yielded a 24% (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.73–0.79) proportional reduction in major coronary events per 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, and with increasing age, we observed a trend towards smaller proportional risk reductions in major coronary events (p trend = 0.009). We observed a 25% (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.73–0.78) proportional reduction in the risk of coronary revascularisation procedures with statin therapy or a more intensive statin regimen per 1.0 mmol/L lower LDL cholesterol, which did not differ significantly across age groups (p trend = 0.6). Similarly, the proportional reductions in stroke of any type (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.80–0.89) did not differ significantly across age groups (p trend = 0.7). After exclusion of four trials which enrolled only patients with heart failure or undergoing renal dialysis (among whom statin therapy has not been shown to be effective), the trend to smaller proportional risk reductions with increasing age persisted for major coronary events (p trend = 0.01), and remained non-significant for major vascular events (p trend = 0.3). The proportional reduction in major vascular events was similar, irrespective of age, among patients with pre-existing vascular disease (p trend = 0.2), but appeared smaller among older than among younger individuals not known to have vascular disease (p trend = 0.05). We found a 12% (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.85–0.91) proportional reduction in vascular mortality per 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, with a trend towards smaller proportional reductions with older age (p trend = 0.004), but this trend did not persist after exclusion of the heart failure or dialysis trials (p trend = 0.2). Statin therapy had no effect at any age on non-vascular mortality, cancer death, or cancer incidence.

Interpretation

Statin therapy produces significant reductions in major vascular events irrespective of age, but there is less direct evidence of benefit among patients older than 75 years who do not already have evidence of occlusive vascular disease. This limitation is now being addressed by further trials.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Limitations and knowledge gaps — randomized controlled trials (RCTs) priorities: The guideline notes that it is based largely on RCT outcomes and that most RCT data are from statin therapy, with limited nonstatin add-on data; more data are needed and several questions remain for additional RCTs, including in secondary prevention whether a lower limit for LDL-C attainment exists beyond which incremental benefit is not worth risks or cost; what indications justify adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy; in patients with ASCVD who have statin-associated side effects whether PCSK9 inhibitors are an effective and safe substitute for high-intensity statins; in primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age with LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L] with or without diabetes mellitus what incremental risk reduction high-intensity statins provide versus moderate-intensity statins; and in primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age with LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L] with or without diabetes mellitus what the value is of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors as an adjunct to maximally tolerated statin therapy.

### Overuse of statins in older adults… [^111yQare]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

He had a coronary stent placed 15 years ago for asymptomatic coronary artery disease that was detected after an exercise stress test. He has visited a cardiologist since the stent placement and is taking 80 mg of atorvastatin per day to reduce his LDL cholesterol to below 80 mg per dL. Clinical Commentary The 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline states that it may be reasonable to initiate or continue moderate- to high-dose statin therapy for secondary prevention and initiate moderate-dose statin therapy for primary prevention in people older than 75 years if they have an LDL cholesterol level of 70 to 189 mg per dL. For primary prevention, this means that 18 million older adults could be eligible for a statin. 2 For people 65 to 75 years of age with one or more risk factors, the U. S.

Preventive Services Task Force recommends that clinicians selectively prescribe statins for those with at least one risk factor and a 7. 5% to 10% risk of a cardiovascular event in 10 years. 2 The ALLHAT evaluated the use of pravastatin for primary prevention in adults older than 65 years who had high cholesterol. 3 The study found no improvement in CAD or mortality in the pravastatin arm despite decreases in LDL cholesterol. There was also a trend toward higher mortality with statins in those older than 75 years. Subgroup analyses of people older than 75 in other studies have shown variable benefits of statins on cardiovascular outcomes and no reductions in mortality.
4. Many older people are prescribed statins for primary prevention despite potential adverse effects and no evidence of effectiveness.

In a study of patients older than 80 years in an integrated health system, 22% of them received a statin, 71% of whom were at low risk of CAD, and most of whom were treated to LDL levels of 90 mg per dL or lower. 5 A national survey showed that the percentage of older people treated with statins for primary prevention increased from 8. 8% in 2000 to 34% in

### CVD risk, patient age factor into statin recommendation… [^114V988p]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

September 12, 2022, 1: 25 p. m. News Staff — People ages 40 to 75 at high risk for cardiovascular disease should initiate statin use to prevent a heart attack or stroke, while those in the same age range at increased risk for CVD should consult a family physician or other primary care clinician to determine whether taking a statin is appropriate, according to an updated recommendation from the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force. The update, which contains three recommendations overall, also says more research is needed to determine whether people 76 or older should start taking a statin for CVD prevention. The AAFP is reviewing the final recommendation statement, final evidence review and evidence summary, which were released Aug. 23, to determine the Academy's stance. The recommendation statement is generally consistent with the task force's 2016 recommendation on the topic.

"Statins effectively and safely prevent first heart attacks and strokes for some people, " task force member John Wong, M. D., said in a USPSTF bulletin. "Whether someone should start taking a statin depends on their age and their risk for having a first heart attack or stroke. " The recommendations apply to adults 40 or older with no history, sign or symptom of CVD who are not already taking statins. They do. Adults ages 40 to 75 were considered at high risk if they had any CVD risk factor and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater, and at increased risk if they had any CVD risk factor and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7. 5% to less than 10%. The task force found that in adults at increased risk but with no history of CVD events, statin therapy significantly reduced the risk of clinical outcomes such as stroke or heart attack by 22% to 33%, while also significantly reducing the risks of all-cause mortality and composite cardiovascular outcomes.

Statin use also was found to reduce the risk for cardiovascular mortality, although this association was not statistically significant. Overall, statin therapy appeared to benefit a wide range of demographic and clinical populations, and was not significantly associated with increased risk of serious adverse events or diabetes. The task force responded to comments on drafts by clarifying language on the use of coronary artery calcium scores to determine statin use and emphasizing the need for more research to improve CVD risk prediction in all racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups.
