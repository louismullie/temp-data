## Question

Mucus plugging on chest xray

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about mucus plugging on chest X-ray, including how to recognize it, what it implies, and how to manage it step-by-step. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the radiographic appearance and the classic "finger-in-glove" sign. Then, I should verify the underlying pathophysiology and why mucus accumulates. Next, I will consider the clinical contexts where mucus plugging is most relevant, including ABPA, asthma, COPD, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis. After that, I need to check the limitations of chest radiography and when to escalate to CT. Then, I will review the clinical implications and prognostic value of mucus plugging. Finally, I should outline a practical management algorithm, including airway clearance, bronchoscopy, and targeted therapies, and close with a concise synthesis that ties imaging to action.

> Let me first confirm the radiographic hallmark. Mucus plugging on chest radiograph classically manifests as branching, tubular opacities that follow the course of bronchi, often described as the "finger-in-glove" sign, which reflects inspissated secretions filling dilated or inflamed airways; this pattern is particularly characteristic of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and can be accompanied by lobar or segmental atelectasis when the airway is completely occluded [^114a5Zes] [^112ppore].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before I jump ahead. Mucus plugging arises from abnormal mucus production and impaired clearance, often driven by type 2 inflammation with goblet cell hyperplasia and mucin overexpression, and can include eosinophil-rich material such as Charcot-Leyden crystals; in diseases like cystic fibrosis, defective CFTR-mediated ion transport further worsens mucus viscosity and retention, while in COPD, neutrophilic inflammation and protease activity contribute to mucus pathology and airway obstruction [^113wHAR9] [^11797sRT] [^116jt5MP] [^112RrHkQ].

> Hold on, I should confirm the clinical contexts where mucus plugging is most relevant. In ABPA, mucoid impaction with bronchiectasis and upper-lobe predominance is typical; in severe asthma, mucus plugs are prevalent and correlate with type 2 inflammation and worse airflow; in COPD, CT-defined mucus plugs are common and associate with symptoms, exacerbations, and mortality; in bronchiectasis, mucus plugging is frequent and linked to disease severity; in cystic fibrosis, mucus plugging is an early and persistent feature that often precedes bronchiectasis and is used in scoring systems to monitor disease [^114a5Zes] [^117WQFLB] [^113ULrbc] [^114UDRDD] [^112dMEjL] [^114rKsXH].

> I need to check the limitations of chest radiography so I don't overstate what CXR can show. CXR can miss or underappreciate mucus plugging, especially in smaller airways, and is far less sensitive than CT; ultra-low-dose CT detects substantially more mucus plugs than CXR and can approach CXR-level radiation with model-based iterative reconstruction, while MRI offers a nonionizing alternative with good sensitivity for mucus but limited availability and cost; thus, if mucus plugging is suspected clinically or if CXR is nondiagnostic, CT should be pursued to confirm and quantify disease [^114CDeyr] [^1171HLFL] [^116GiD7w].

> Next, I should review the clinical implications and prognostic value so I can tie imaging to outcomes. In COPD, mucus plugs in medium-to-large airways independently associate with worse lung function, more frequent exacerbations, and higher all-cause mortality; in asthma, mucus plugs are a persistent phenotype and changes in plug burden correlate with changes in FEV1; in bronchiectasis, serial changes in mucus plugging track with functional decline; in cystic fibrosis, mucus plugging is among the earliest detectable abnormalities and often precedes bronchiectasis, underscoring its prognostic significance [^1119eGjh] [^113m4WhH] [^113iZU6C] [^114rKsXH].

> Let me think about immediate management steps when mucus plugging is suspected. First, I should confirm airway patency and hemodynamics, then initiate aggressive airway clearance with inhaled hypertonic saline, chest physiotherapy, and positive expiratory pressure devices; if there is lobar collapse, respiratory compromise, or failure to improve, I should proceed to bronchoscopy for direct visualization and removal of plugs, ideally early, because delays can worsen outcomes; in refractory cases, consider adjuncts such as DNase in CF or carefully selected mucolytics, and escalate to noninvasive ventilation or intubation if needed [^112ppore] [^114f28uA] [^116YTWy2].

> But wait, what if the mucus plugging reflects a specific disease process that needs targeted therapy. In ABPA, systemic corticosteroids and antifungal therapy are indicated; in severe eosinophilic asthma, biologics targeting type 2 pathways can reduce mucus plugging and improve lung function; in COPD with chronic bronchitic features, optimize inhaled therapy and consider strategies to reduce mucus hypersecretion; in CF, highly effective CFTR modulators reduce mucus plugging and improve outcomes; in bronchiectasis, treat underlying infection and inflammation and consider long-term airway clearance programs [^114a5Zes] [^113NBvRb] [^112e8B5p] [^112dMEjL] [^115KWo3Q].

> I should double-check the role of imaging in follow-up and risk stratification. Serial CT can document the evolution of mucus plugging and related structural changes, informing prognosis and response to therapy; quantitative or semiquantitative scoring systems, while not yet routine in all settings, can standardize assessment and support research and clinical decision-making, particularly in CF and bronchiectasis where mucus and bronchiectasis scores carry substantial weight [^112dMEjL] [^111RwamM] [^115vSUFH].

> Let me reconsider the initial premise to ensure internal consistency. Mucus plugging on chest X-ray is best recognized by the finger-in-glove sign and by associated volume loss when complete obstruction occurs; however, CXR is insensitive, so a normal film does not exclude disease, and CT is the definitive modality for detection, quantification, and etiologic clues; clinically, mucus plugging signals a treatable trait linked to worse symptoms, exacerbations, and mortality across obstructive airway diseases, and management should prioritize airway clearance, timely bronchoscopy when indicated, and disease-specific therapies to address the underlying inflammatory or genetic drivers [^114a5Zes] [^114CDeyr] [^1119eGjh] [^113m4WhH].

Mucus plugging on chest X-ray appears as **branching, tubular opacities** following the bronchial tree, often with a "finger-in-glove" or "V-shaped" pattern, and may cause lobar or segmental atelectasis or consolidation [^114a5Zes]. It is most often due to asthma, ABPA, bronchiectasis, or cystic fibrosis, and is best confirmed by CT when the chest X-ray is inconclusive [^114a5Zes] [^112dMEjL] [^116GiD7w]. Management focuses on **airway clearance**, bronchodilators, and treating the underlying cause; urgent bronchoscopy is indicated for severe obstruction or respiratory compromise [^112ppore] [^114f28uA].

---

## Radiographic appearance

Mucus plugging on chest X-ray typically presents with the following **characteristics**:

- **Branching, tubular opacities**: These opacities follow the course of the bronchi, often resembling a "finger-in-glove" or "V-shaped" pattern [^114a5Zes].

- **Lobar or segmental atelectasis**: Complete obstruction of a bronchus can cause lobar or segmental collapse, appearing as increased opacity with volume loss (e.g. elevated hemidiaphragm, mediastinal shift).

- **Air bronchograms**: Partial obstruction may show air bronchograms, indicating patent bronchi within consolidated areas.

- **Hyperinflation**: Obstruction of a main bronchus can cause compensatory hyperinflation of the contralateral lung.

## Common causes of mucus plugging

Mucus plugging can occur in **various clinical scenarios**, including:

| **Clinical condition** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|
| Asthma | - Bronchospasm <br/> - Thickened mucus <br/> - Eosinophilic inflammation [^117WQFLB] |
| Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) | - Hyperattenuating mucus <br/> - Bronchiectasis <br/> - Atelectasis [^114a5Zes] |
| Bronchiectasis | - Chronic airway inflammation <br/> - Infection <br/> - Mucus stasis [^115RXHsy] |
| Cystic fibrosis | - Thick, tenacious mucus <br/> - Chronic infection <br/> - Bronchiectasis [^112dMEjL] |
| Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) | - Chronic bronchitis <br/> - Mucus hypersecretion <br/> - Airway obstruction [^113ULrbc] |
| Pneumonia | - Inflammatory exudate <br/> - Mucus accumulation [^116YTWy2] |

---

## Clinical significance

Mucus plugging is **clinically significant** because it can cause:

- **Airway obstruction**: Leading to atelectasis, consolidation, and respiratory distress [^112dMEjL].

- **Exacerbations**: Particularly in asthma, COPD, and bronchiectasis, mucus plugging is associated with increased exacerbation frequency and severity [^112DwyNU] [^1176Ledr].

- **Persistent symptoms**: Chronic cough, wheezing, and recurrent infections are common in patients with recurrent mucus plugging [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic approach

The diagnostic approach to mucus plugging includes:

- **Chest X-ray**: Initial screening tool to identify characteristic opacities and associated atelectasis or consolidation.

- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Gold standard for confirming mucus plugging, especially in complex cases or when chest X-ray findings are inconclusive [^notfound].

- **Bronchoscopy**: Indicated for severe obstruction, respiratory compromise, or when mucus plugging is suspected but not confirmed by imaging [^114f28uA].

---

## Management strategies

Management of mucus plugging focuses on **airway clearance** and treating the underlying cause:

- **Airway clearance techniques**: Chest physiotherapy, positive expiratory pressure (PEP) devices, and high-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) are effective in mobilizing and clearing mucus [^112ppore].

- **Pharmacological therapy**: Bronchodilators, mucolytics (e.g. dornase alfa), and anti-inflammatory medications (e.g. corticosteroids) are used based on the underlying condition [^113wHAR9].

- **Bronchoscopy**: Urgent bronchoscopy is indicated for severe obstruction, respiratory compromise, or failure of conservative management [^114f28uA].

- **Treatment of underlying conditions**: Addressing asthma, ABPA, bronchiectasis, or cystic fibrosis is essential to prevent recurrence [^115KWo3Q].

---

## Prognosis and complications

The prognosis of mucus plugging depends on the **underlying condition**, severity of obstruction, and timeliness of intervention. Complications include atelectasis, pneumonia, respiratory failure, and chronic lung disease if left untreated [^116YTWy2] [^115WFMCU] [^1163Bgzd].

Mucus plugging on chest X-ray is identified by branching, tubular opacities and may cause atelectasis or consolidation. It is most often due to asthma, ABPA, bronchiectasis, or cystic fibrosis, and is best confirmed by CT when the chest X-ray is inconclusive. Management centers on **airway clearance**, bronchodilators, and treating the underlying cause; urgent bronchoscopy is indicated for severe obstruction or respiratory compromise [^114a5Zes] [^112dMEjL] [^112ppore] [^114f28uA].

### Imaging to advance bronchiectasis phenotyping [^115RXHsy]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Mucus plugging as evidenced on CT scans may indicate active infection or persistent inflammation. Beyond bronchiectasis, mucus plugging has been associated with poor outcomes across various conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, and primary ciliary dyskinesia, among others, and it has even become an endpoint in therapy evaluations. In the study by Pieters and colleagues, the extent of bronchiectasis and the presence of mucus plugging (found in up to 89% of patients) and parenchymal abnormalities were associated with important clinical outcomes. These findings support the importance of airway clearance therapies in this patient population.

This study boasts several strengths, notably its inclusion of one of the largest cohorts of patients with bronchiectasis, which allows for a thorough examination of the relationships between radiographic abnormalities and clinically relevant outcomes. The European Multi-center Bronchiectasis Audit and Research Collaboration cohort, well characterized and multicentric, provided a robust foundation for the study, which utilized a meticulously validated visual radiographic scoring system. However, there are noteworthy limitations to consider. First, the radiographic abnormalities identified represent only a snapshot lacking information on their stability or progression, particularly given that radiographic scores may change over time. The scoring system requires expert training, takes a long time, and is subject to interobserver variability, which hinders its large-scale application. Although some studies have addressed this limitation using artificial intelligence–based algorithms, these technologies are still in the nascent stages of development and have not yet been incorporated into routine clinical practice. Last, it is worth noting that the median time between scanning and enrollment was 7 months. This challenges the interpretation of certain associations, such as the link between radiographic scores and hospital admission in the year before study entry. This association was found when the time elapsed was under the median value only, indicating that patients who underwent clinical assessment before imaging were primarily affected.

In conclusion, we congratulate Pieters and colleagues on this important work. Their study's findings move us toward more accurate phenotyping of bronchiectasis, supporting the hypothesis that radiographic abnormalities may provide valuable clinical insights. As our knowledge of bronchiectasis expands and with advancements in imaging technologies and scoring systems, precise phenotyping will help clinicians advance diagnosis and tailor treatments more effectively for these patients. We eagerly look forward to longitudinal studies that aim to bridge the gap between imaging technologies and clinical application and, thereby, deepen our understanding of bronchiectasis biology.

### Update on the role of chest imaging in cystic fibrosis [^112dMEjL]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease with multisystem involvement and associated morbidity and mortality that are most directly related to progressive lung disease. The hallmark findings of cystic fibrosis in the lungs are chronic inflammation and infection, leading to progressive loss of pulmonary function and often requiring lung transplant. Predominant lung findings include mucous plugging, bronchiectasis, and air trapping, often with associated atelectasis, consolidation, and emphysema; these findings form the basis of several clinical scoring systems that are used for imaging assessment. Recently, there have been major breakthroughs in the pharmacologic management of cystic fibrosis, including highly effective modulator therapies that directly target the underlying cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator molecular defect, often leading to remarkable improvements in lung function and quality of life with corresponding significant improvements in imaging markers. The authors review current guidelines regarding cystic fibrosis with respect to disease monitoring, identifying complications, and managing advanced lung disease. In addition, they discuss the evolving role of imaging, including current trends, emerging technologies, and proposed updates to imaging guidelines endorsed by international expert committees on cystic fibrosis, which favor increased use of cross-sectional imaging to enable earlier detection of structural changes in early disease and more sensitive detection of acute changes in advanced disease. It is important for radiologists to be familiar with these trends and updates so that they can most effectively assist clinicians in guiding the management of patients with cystic fibrosis in all stages of disease. © RSNA, 2024.

### Imaging to advance bronchiectasis phenotyping [^114UDRDD]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Bronchiectasis is a heterogeneous disease with a wide range of clinical presentations, and its prevalence is on the rise globally, contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality. Over the past decade, there has been an increase in understanding of its pathophysiology, which is largely due to multinational patient registries. Registry studies have shed light on clinical phenotypes and patient risk factors, shaping treatment priorities and facilitating the development of targeted therapies. Despite these advancements, there remains a gap in our understanding of the radiographic abnormalities found in these patients.

Chest computed tomography (CT) remains the benchmark for diagnosing bronchiectasis, offering an invaluable tool to identify patients at risk of poor outcomes. In this issue of the Journal, Pieters and colleagues (pp.) report a quantitative analysis of CT findings from a subset of the European Multi-center Bronchiectasis Audit and Research Collaboration (or, EMBARC) Registry. Drawing from patients across six European countries and eight study sites, the authors rigorously evaluated CT images from 524 participants. Using an annotated grid-scoring method, the authors determined the presence and extent of atelectasis, consolidation, bronchiectasis with and without mucus plugs, airway wall thickening, and parenchymal abnormalities. Composite scores encompassing total bronchiectasis, total mucus plugging, and total CT inflammation characteristics were created. A final score integrating all three categories was used to encapsulate the spectrum of radiographic abnormalities.

As expected, Pieters and colleagues found that patients in their study presented extensive radiographic abnormalities and a broad range of features, including abnormal airway dilation and mucus plugs, highlighting the disease's heterogeneity. Older individuals and those with longer disease duration exhibited more severe scores. The presence of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) and Pseudomonas were significantly associated with higher overall disease burden scores. All composite radiographic scores negatively correlated with lung function and were associated with clinical severity scores. Last, both CT inflammation and total disease scores were associated with hospital admissions.

In clinical practice, clinicians frequently encounter patients with bronchiectasis who have considerable abnormalities on CT but relatively low symptom burdens, whereas in other cases, the reverse scenario occurs. The challenge lies in determining the clinical relevance of radiographically apparent abnormalities. Findings from this study suggest that a thorough evaluation of CT images can help identify risk profiles and pinpoint which abnormalities may carry greater clinical significance. Despite this, only a few studies have systematically evaluated radiographic abnormalities.

### Persistent airway plugs: a call for clinical recognition and novel therapies [^114rXdfK]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In 2018, Dunican and colleagues were the first to describe the radiographic "mucus score" as the summation of bronchopulmonary segments with one or more mucus plugs visualized on computed tomography (CT) lung scans. Since this initial report, the recognition of CT as a noninvasive means to quantify the burden of mucus plugging in vivo has garnered significant clinical interest. Although the term "mucus plug" has generally been accepted to describe the CT observation of complete occlusion of the airway lumen, it is important to recognize nuances of the mucus score. First, the composition of CT-visible intraluminal plugs has not been directly characterized and may contain not only mucus but also inflammatory cells, plasma exudate, extracellular traps, and Charcot–Leyden crystals. Second, peripheral airways are beyond the spatial resolution limit of CT, and therefore, the score is representative of mucus plugs in the larger proximal airways. Third, partial occlusions of the airway lumen are not scored. Finally, the score for each bronchopulmonary segment is binary (0 or 1), with no weight given to the proximal location of plugging (segmental vs. subsegmental), plug size, or the number of airways involved within an individual bronchopulmonary segment. Regardless of these uncertainties and potential limitations, cross-sectional cohort studies from the United States (85 of 146 [58%]), United Kingdom (69 of 116 [60%]), and Canada (18 of 27 [66%]) conclusively agree that mucus plugging assessed by the CT mucus score is surprisingly common in severe asthma. With that preface, in this issue of the Journal, Tang and colleagues (pp.) take advantage of baseline and Year 3 chest CT scans acquired from the SARP-3 (Severe Asthma Research Program-3) study to provide new information regarding the temporal behavior of airway mucus plugs and their relationship with changes in lung function.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of aspergillosis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114a5Zes]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Mucoid impaction — Mucoid impaction is a clinical-radiographic syndrome characterized by inspissated mucus filling of the bronchi; the finger-in-glove sign is the classic chest radiograph finding, and patients can be asymptomatic or present with cough and expectoration of mucous plugs. Mucous plugging that may appear hyperattenuated on computed tomography seems to be a particularly distinctive feature of ABPA. Mucoid impaction associated with bronchiectasis is treated with maneuvers to promote airway clearance and treatment of airway infection, whereas mucoid impaction associated with features of asthma and hypersensitivity to Aspergillus is treated as for ABPA.

### Clinical and pathophysiological roles of lower lobe-dominant mucus plugs on computed tomography in patients with asthma with and without bronchiectasis [^1176Ledr]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a chronic airway disease, characterized by airway inflammation and variable clinical presentations. Despite advancements in medical interventions, including biologics, a substantial number of patients with asthma remain symptomatic, experiencing exacerbations and having impaired lung function. This highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the factors associated with low lung function and exacerbations. Airway mucus plugging was first described in autopsy findings of fatal asthma and subsequently quantified on chest computed tomography (CT). Mucus plugs in the airways impair lung function, increase the risk of exacerbation, and persist in the same bronchial segments over time, serving as an important biomarker of asthma.,

Emerging evidence suggests that the spatial distribution of mucus plugs is worth addressing in the context of asthma pathophysiology. On ultrahigh-resolution computed tomography (U-HRCT), which allows more accurate measurements of wall thickness of airways peripheral to subsegmental airways than conventional HRCT, mucus plugging is associated with wall thickening of these airways, but not segmental and subsegmental airways. Moreover, mucus plugs are more frequently found in the lower lobes than in the upper lobes, and specific lung segments with mucus plugging exhibit greater wall thickening and ventilation defects than those without mucus plugging. Because local ventilation may be more impaired in the lower lungs than in the upper lungs as asthma severity increases, it was hypothesized that lower lobe–dominant mucus plugging could be associated with more severe pathophysiological changes and exacerbations in patients with asthma. However, little is known about the clinical roles of upper-lower lobe distributions of mucus plugging in patients with asthma.

### Mucus plugging on computed tomography and chronic bronchitis in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113ULrbc]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

We divided subjects into those with at least one airway plugged with mucus (MP+) and those without MP (MP−). Additionally, based on prior research in asthma showing that mucus plugging of ≥ 4 segments was associated with worse lung function, we divided subjects into those with an MP score ≥ 4 and compared them to those with an MP score < 4. We compared subject characteristics between groups with either an unpaired t test or Chi-square test. Odds ratios for CB were calculated with MP scores using multivariable logistic regression models. Covariates included demographics, lung function, smoking, and radiologic parameters.

Subject characteristics are presented in Table 1. 658 (31.5%) subjects had mucus plugging on CT scan. 133 (6.4%) subjects had an MP score of ≥ 4. Compared to the MP− group, the MP+ group was more likely to have CB by either the classic definition (cough and phlegm for at least 3 months/year for 2 consecutive years, 29.2 vs. 22.9%) or the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) definition (cough and phlegm for the past 4 weeks almost every day or several days a week, 39.1 vs. 25.4%). In the MP ≥ 4 group, the differences were more significant with 57.7% and 41.4% of the subjects having SGRQ CB and classic CB, respectively, compared to 27.6% and 23.8% of the MP < 4 group. In those with classic CB (n = 519), 36.9% of them had MP compared to 29.7% of those without classic CB (n = 1570, p = 0.002). 10.6% of the classic CB group had an MP score ≥ 4 compared to 5.0% of those without classic CB (p < 0.0001). Similar values were found when comparing those with and without SGRQ CB (38.8 vs. 25.1%, p < 0.0001 for MP+ vs. MP− and 11.4 vs. 3.5%, p < 0.0001 for MP ≥ 4 vs. MP < 4). Dyspnea, health-related quality of life, and lung function were worse in the MP+ group (p < 0.05 for all). Percent emphysema, percent gas trapping, airway wall thickness, exacerbation frequency and severe exacerbation frequency were all significantly higher in the MP+ group (p < 0.05 for all). Except for %emphysema, findings were similarly significant in the MP ≥ 4 group compared to the MP < 4 group.

### Airway mucus plugs on chest computed tomography are associated with exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112DwyNU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale/Objective: Acute exacerbations (AEs) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Whether mucus plugs are associated with prospective exacerbations has not been examined extensively.

Methods

Mucus plugs were visually-identified on baseline chest computed tomography (CT) scans from smokers with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grades 2–4 COPD enrolled in two multicenter cohort studies: Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints (ECLIPSE) and COPDGene. Associations between ordinal mucus plug score categories (0/1–2/ ≥ 3) and prospectively-ascertained AEs, defined as worsening respiratory symptoms requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics (moderate-to-severe) and/or ER/hospitalization (severe), were assessed using multivariable-adjusted zero-inflated Poisson regression; subjects were exacerbation-free at enrollment.

Results

Among 3,250 participants in COPDGene (mean ± SD age 63.7 ± 8.4 years, FEV1 50.6% ± 17.8% predicted, 45.1% female) and 1,716 participants in ECLIPSE (age 63.3 ± 7.1 years, FEV1 48.3% ± 15.8% predicted, 36.2% female), 44.4% and 46.0% had mucus plugs, respectively. The incidence rates of AEs were 61.0 (COPDGene) and 125.7 (ECLIPSE) per 100 person-years. Relative to those without mucus plugs, the presence of 1–2 and ≥ 3 mucus plugs was associated with increased risk (adjusted rate ratio, aRR [95%CI] = 1.07[1.05–1.09] and 1.15[1.1–1.2] in COPDGene; aRR = 1.06[1.02–1.09] and 1.12[1.04–1.2] in ECLIPSE, respectively) for prospective moderate-to-severe AEs. The presence of 1–2 and ≥ 3 mucus plugs was also associated with increased risk for severe AEs during follow-up (aRR = 1.05[1.01–1.08] and 1.09[1.02–1.18] in COPDGene; aRR = 1.17[1.07–1.27] and 1.37[1.15–1.62] in ECLIPSE, respectively).

Conclusion

CT-based mucus plugs are associated with an increased risk for future COPD AEs.

Subject characteristics

Data are expressed as mean ± SD or percent

Odds ratios (OR) for classic CB and SGRQ CB are shown in Table 2. MP+ was associated with an OR of 1.21 and 1.38 for classic CB and SGRQ CB, respectively when adjusting for demographics, lung function, smoking, and CT measures of emphysema and airway wall thickness. Similarly, MP ≥ 4 was associated with an OR of 1.67 and 2.05 for classic CB and SGRQ CB, respectively.

Table 2
Odds ratios (OR) for chronic bronchitis

Data represent OR (95% CI). Covariates: Model 1: age, gender, race. Model 2: age, gender, race, and FEV1%predicted. Model 3: age, gender, race, FEV1% predicted, current smoking and pack year history. Model 4: age, gender, race, FEV1% predicted, current smoking and pack year history, Pi10 and %emphysema

These data also show that more subjects with MP, looking at two different thresholds (MP+ versus — and MP ≥ 4 versus < 4) had CB using two different definitions. Additionally, regardless of the presence or absence of CB, those with MP have worse symptoms, health-related quality of life and lung function compared to those without MP, showing that radiographic assessment of MP provides complementary information to the clinical assessment of CB.

Plugging of the small airways is a central pathologic feature of COPD. In a large study of pathologic specimens, patients with worse lung function were more likely to have small airway mucus luminal occlusion. Radiologically, MP has been linked to severity of airflow obstruction, eosinophilic inflammation, and interleukin-4 blood levels in asthma. In two smaller studies, MP was associated with worse lung function and health-related quality of life in smokers with and without COPD, but neither CB nor eosinophilia. To date, this is the first study finding a significant association between mucus plugging and CB in a large cohort of COPD subjects. While the percent of our MP+ subjects who had CB was similar compared to prior studies, our findings likely differ because of the size of our cohort and differences in subject characteristics (other studies included never smokers and smokers without airflow obstruction).

### Mucus plugging on computed tomography and chronic bronchitis in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^11764ty9]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

The relationship between mucus plugging and emphysema is an interesting one. More mucus plugs have been found in COPD subjects with worse airflow obstruction; additionally, more emphysema is seen in COPD patients with worse airflow obstruction. Previous smaller studies in smokers with and without COPD have found weak but significant correlations between mucus plugging scores and percent emphysema. Our analysis was restricted to those with COPD, and we found statistically different amounts of percent emphysema between those with and without mucus plugs but the difference was not great. This suggests that mucus plugging may play a role in the pathophysiology of airflow obstruction in COPD, independent of emphysema.

We found that using a high threshold for MP scores (≥ 4) was significantly associated with CB, particularly when defined using the SGRQ. This may be related to the SGRQ CB definition identifying "active" symptoms (cough and phlegm in the past 4 weeks), compared to the classic CB definition which is better at identifying chronic symptoms (2 years). However, the higher threshold of MP was only present in 6.4%, suggesting that using any MP as a threshold may be more practical. Regardless of the definition, in this well-characterized cohort of COPD subjects, MP on CT scan was significantly associated with CB. Compared to those without MP, those with MP had worse symptoms, health-related quality of life, and lung function regardless of the presence or absence of CB. The findings suggest that imaging is a useful tool to objectively measure mucus dysfunction, a central pathophysiologic feature of CB. Further study is necessary to identify the consequences of MP on other patient reported outcomes.

### Mucus plugs in medium-sized airways: a novel imaging biomarker for phenotyping chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1154QvAX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Multiple studies have already focused on the phenotyping of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by assessing emphysema and airway disease on chest computed tomography (CT). In 2015, the Fleischner Society proposed to differentiate between emphysema-predominant and airway-predominant imaging subtypes based on the presence of at least 5% pulmonary emphysema. Additionally, it defined five different subtypes of emphysema-predominant phenotypes based on a visual assessment of the severity and pattern of emphysema. More recently, an ancillary study from the COPDGene (Genetic Epidemiology of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) study described 10 nonoverlapping CT imaging subtypes by combining visual and quantitative CT imaging features. Although emphysema can be simply quantified by measuring the percentage of lung voxels below −950 Hounsfield units, the assessment of airway disease is usually more complex. Bronchial airway disease can be estimated either visually or automatically by measuring bronchial wall thickness. For small airway disease quantification, most previous studies focused on density measurements on expiratory images.

### Mucus plugging on computed tomography and chronic bronchitis in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116vNQq6]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

To the Editor,

Chronic bronchitis (CB) is associated with more dyspnea, increased respiratory exacerbations, reduced exercise capacity, and mortality. The hallmark of CB is mucus overproduction and goblet cell hyperplasia. Mucus plugging (MP) on CT scan has been associated with decreased lung function, worse health-related quality of life, and amount of emphysema in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). How it relates to CB in smokers with COPD is unclear. We hypothesized that those with MP are more likely to have CB compared to those without MP.

We analyzed 2089 randomly chosen subjects from the Genetic Epidemiology Study of COPD (COPDGene). Briefly, this cohort was comprised of African American and non-Hispanic White current and former smokers (≥ 10 pack year history) 45–80 years of age with COPD. Measurement of MP has been described previously. A mucus plug was defined as an opacity that completely occludes the lumen, regardless of the airway size, orientation or generation. Major airways such as the trachea, main stem and lobar bronchi were excluded. In a standardized fashion, all airway paths were examined in each out of 18 bronchopulmonary segments of both lungs. An MP score was generated for each CT scan as an aggregation of the number of bronchopulmonary segments with MP (0–18). If a CT scan required more than one reading, the final MP score was an average of the scores from two or three readers.

### Mucus plugs in medium-sized airways: a novel imaging biomarker for phenotyping chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112cz7Lp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The study by Dunican and colleagues is most important as it confirms the importance of mucus plugging in the pathophysiology of COPD. Seminal histopathology studies by Hogg and colleagues have identified anatomical determinants of airflow limitation in patients with COPD, including increased airway wall thickness and mucus plugging in small airways (< 2 mm in internal diameter), and their prognostic value; emphysema extent and characteristics also contributed to airway limitation via loss of elastic recoil. However, small airways are not directly visible on CT scans; although the relationship of CT-defined mucus plugging in medium-sized airways (2–2.5 mm) to pathology-defined mucus plugging in small airways is currently unknown, the study by Dunican and colleagues provides a noninvasive way to examine mucus plugging in living humans and to repeat this analysis over time. An important finding of this study was also that mucus plugging in medium-sized airways often occurs without symptoms of chronic cough and sputum production; this finding is not completely unexpected, as cough receptors are located in large proximal airways, leading to the prediction that plugging in medium and small airways can occur without symptoms. Multiple studies have shown a strong relationship between symptoms of chronic cough and sputum production and rates of exacerbations in patients with COPD. Whether these findings are independent to CT-defined mucus plugging remains to be established. Furthermore, the findings that patients with high mucus scores have higher COPD assessment test scores is somewhat puzzling, as this is most likely not related to symptoms of cough and sputum.

### Clinical and pathophysiological roles of lower lobe-dominant mucus plugs on computed tomography in patients with asthma with and without bronchiectasis [^112Mn7gM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to the mechanical impacts related to the distinct spatial distribution of mucus plugs, their association with airway inflammatory types should be clarified for effective asthma management. Mucus plugging is typically associated with eosinophils and type 2 inflammation in asthmaand chronic obstructive airway diseases. However, a more complex inflammatory process is proposed in approximately 20% of mucus plugging cases. Indeed, in patients with refractory asthma with comorbid bronchiectasis, the association between the whole-lung mucus plug score and type 2 inflammation was influenced by the presence of neutrophils and monocytes, making it less straightforward. Further analysis of the spatial distribution of mucus plugs is needed to understand their association with inflammatory types in asthma.

Taken together, we aimed to examine whether a difference in mucus plug score between lower and upper/middle lobes (Δ mucus plug score) could be associated with lower lung function, the presence of exacerbations, exhaled nitric oxide (F), and other clinical and pathophysiological features by using 2 cohorts, including a cohort of patients with asthma without a clinical diagnosis of bronchiectasis and another cohort of patients with asthma with bronchiectasis.

### Mucus plugs: a treatable trait for preventing COPD exacerbations [^111irSkV]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are burdensome to patients and healthcare systems and a harbinger of more severe disease outcomes. Frequent exacerbations are associated with lung function decline, worsening quality of life, and increased risk of hospitalizations and mortality in patients with COPD. As stated in the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines, "after an acute exacerbation, appropriate measures for prevention of further exacerbations should be initiated". Investigators have long been searching for predictors of future exacerbations, such that at-risk patients can be identified and treatments initiated to prevent future exacerbations.

Important predictors of future exacerbations include a history of prior exacerbations and lower lung function. However, it is often pointed out that these clinical features are not useful predictors for those with pre-COPD or mild COPD who have yet to experience an exacerbation. Other limitations include the fact that history of exacerbations is self-reported and may therefore suffer from recall bias or underreporting. More objective predictors and predictors of exacerbations in patients with earlier forms of COPD are of interest, such as those derived from computed tomography (CT) imaging. For example, CT imaging–derived measures of emphysema, density gradient texture (believed to reflect peribronchovascular emphysema), and airway remodeling have been shown to predict COPD exacerbations.

Emphysema and small airway remodeling and/or loss are well-known pathological features of COPD. However, studies of excised lung tissue also show that luminal occlusion by mucus exudates are critical pathological features. Mucus plugs can create a favorable environment for exacerbations through various mechanisms, such as creating regional hypoxia, which may promote local inflammation and airway dysbiosis. Until recently, there was no CT-based approach available to quantitatively assess mucus plugs. Dunican and colleagues developed a bronchopulmonary scoring system with which radiologists examine and assign a score of 0 or 1 to each bronchopulmonary segment on the basis of whether it has a mucus plug, and these scores are then summed to generate a total score. By using this scoring system, investigators have shown that mucus plugs are prevalent in 41–67% of individuals with COPD, and the presence of mucus plugs on CT is associated with lower lung function, worse quality of life, and higher all-cause mortality. Although there is increasing evidence that mucus plugs play an important role in COPD pathogenesis and progression, the role of mucus plugs on CT as predictors of COPD exacerbations remains unexplored.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^115QZ5HN]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Leveraging incidental lung imaging abnormalities for COPD screening — Airflow obstruction or emphysema are described as markers of an increased risk for lung cancer, and the severity of airflow obstruction and the presence of emphysema are both independent risk factors that may be useful indicators for triaging patients for more careful lung cancer surveillance. In individuals imaged outside of lung cancer screening, CT scans can be used to help identify individuals at increased risk for COPD and prompt consideration for spirometry. Emphysema is a hallmark of COPD and is easily detected on chest imaging by visual inspection by a radiologist or through quantitative lung density, and lung imaging may also reveal air trapping, airway wall thickening and mucus plugging; these abnormalities may not only indicate airflow obstruction but also patients that might have a more rapid decline in lung function and worse quality of life. Because quantitative LDCT analysis is often not available in clinical settings, the presence of emphysema and other airway abnormalities should raise clinical suspicion for COPD and lead to detailed assessment of symptoms and consideration for pulmonary function testing if not previously performed. The use of spirometry in targeted patients undergoing lung cancer screening or when incidental imaging abnormalities consistent with parenchymal or airway manifestations of airways disorders are found is recommended by GOLD.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^11361sfd]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) — airway abnormalities in COPD: CT can show bronchiectasis, visible in roughly 30% of COPD patients, which is associated with increased exacerbation frequency and mortality. CT can also visualize airway mucus plugs and support a mucus plug score; higher scores are associated with poorer lung function, higher CAT score, more frequent exacerbations, and increased mortality, though scoring is not yet routine clinical practice. Measurements of small airways (< 2 mm diameter) must be inferred by comparing inspiratory and expiratory scans to identify non-emphysematous gas trapping, and small airway abnormality may be present without detectable spirometric obstruction and indicate increased risk for lung function decline.

### Mucus plugs: a treatable trait for preventing COPD exacerbations [^112e8B5p]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Perhaps the most exciting takeaway from this study is the potential therapeutic implications. As the authors discuss, medical therapy for COPD relies on bronchodilators and corticosteroids, which likely will not prevent excess mucus secretion or aid in mucus clearance. However, in other lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, mucus clearance is achieved through targeted therapies (e.g. CFTR [cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator] modulators) or mechanical strategies (e.g. positive expiratory pressure mask). Further research is needed to investigate the efficacy of mucus clearance strategies in reducing exacerbations in patients with COPD with CT-identified mucus plugs. Furthermore, an important limitation of this study was the focus on only moderate to severe COPD. It will be important to investigate whether mucus plugs on CT imaging predict exacerbations in patients with mild COPD, or those with pre-COPD, in whom prevention with early treatment may offer the greatest impact on disease progression.

In summary, Wan and colleagues provide important insights on the role of mucus plugs in COPD exacerbations. In addition to highlighting the role mucus plugs may play as a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of COPD exacerbations, their findings also underscore the heterogeneity of COPD and the need for a tailored approached to COPD management on the basis of individual patient characteristics, such as the presence and severity of mucus plugs. How exactly mucus plugs on CT imaging will fit in the bigger picture of COPD management is yet to be determined, but these findings provide compelling evidence that it may soon be time to "pull the plug" on COPD exacerbations.

### Luminal plugging on chest CT scan: association with lung function, quality of life, and COPD clinical phenotypes [^112MwVWk]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Mucous exudates occluding the lumen of small airways are associated with reduced lung function and mortality in subjects with COPD; however, luminal plugs in large airways have not been widely studied. We aimed to examine the associations of chest CT scan-identified luminal plugging with lung function, health-related quality of life, and COPD phenotypes.

Methods

We randomly selected 100 smokers without COPD and 400 smokers with COPD from the COPDGene Study. Luminal plugging was visually identified on inspiratory CT scans at baseline and 5-year follow-up. The relationships of luminal plugging to FEV 1, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score, emphysema on CT scan (defined as the percentage of low attenuation area < 950 Hounsfield units [%LAA-950]), and chronic bronchitis were assessed using linear and logistic multivariable analyses.

Results

Overall, 111 subjects (22%) had luminal plugging. The prevalence of luminal plugging was higher in subjects with COPD than those without COPD (25% vs 10%, respectively; p = 0.001). In subjects with COPD, luminal plugging was significantly associated with FEV 1% predicted (estimate, -6.1; SE, 2.1; p = 0.004) and SGRQ score (estimate, 4.9; SE, 2.4; p = 0.04) in adjusted models. Although luminal plugging was associated with log %LAA-950 (estimate, 0.43; SE, 0.16; p = 0.007), its relationship with chronic bronchitis did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.07). Seventy-three percent of subjects with COPD with luminal plugging at baseline had it 5 years later.

Conclusions

In subjects with COPD, CT-identified luminal plugging is associated with airflow obstruction, worse health-related quality of life, and emphysema phenotype. This imaging feature may supplement the current clinical assessment of chronic mucus hypersecretion in COPD.

### High-attenuation mucus plugs on MDCT in a child with cystic fibrosis: potential cause and differential diagnosis [^112sAsvg]. Pediatric Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

High-attenuation mucus plugging is a rare finding in both adults and children. When it occurs, the field of differential diagnoses is typically quite small and includes acute hemorrhage, aspiration of radiodense material, and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). The last of these three diagnoses is the most difficult to make, although ABPA is more commonly seen in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) or asthma. ABPA is radiographically characterized by recurrent mucus plugging, atelectasis, and central bronchiectasis. Thus far, high-attenuation mucus plugs have only been reported in adults. We report a rare case of a child with CF who had high-attenuation mucus plugs and atelectasis that raised the possibility of ABPA. We discuss the differential diagnoses of this finding and the role of multidetector CT in these children.

### Airway-occluding mucus plugs and mortality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1119eGjh]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Airway mucus plugs are common in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however, the association of airway mucus plugging and mortality in patients with COPD is unknown.

Objective

To determine whether airway mucus plugs identified on chest computed tomography (CT) were associated with increased all-cause mortality.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Observational retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of patients with a diagnosis of COPD in the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD cohort. Participants were non-Hispanic Black or White individuals, aged 45 to 80 years, who smoked at least 10 pack-years. Participants were enrolled at 21 centers across the US between November 2007 and April 2011 and were followed up through August 31, 2022.

Exposures

Mucus plugs that completely occluded airways on chest CT scans, identified in medium- to large-sized airways (ie, approximately2- to 10-mm lumen diameter) and categorized as affecting 0, 1 to 2, or 3 or more lung segments.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, assessed with proportional hazard regression analysis. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race and ethnicity, body mass index, pack-years smoked, current smoking status, forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration, and CT measures of emphysema and airway disease.

Results

Among the 4483 participants with COPD, 4363 were included in the primary analysis (median age, 63 years [IQR, 57–70 years]; 44% were women). A total of 2585 (59.3%), 953 (21.8%), and 825 (18.9%) participants had mucus plugs in 0, 1 to 2, and 3 or more lung segments, respectively. During a median 9.5-year follow-up, 1769 participants (40.6%) died. The mortality rates were 34.0% (95% CI, 32.2%-35.8%), 46.7% (95% CI, 43.5%-49.9%), and 54.1% (95% CI, 50.7%-57.4%) in participants who had mucus plugs in 0, 1 to 2, and 3 or more lung segments, respectively. The presence of mucus plugs in 1 to 2 vs 0 and 3 or more vs 0 lung segments was associated with an adjusted hazard ratio of death of 1.15 (95% CI, 1.02–1.29) and 1.24 (95% CI, 1.10–1.41), respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

In participants with COPD, the presence of mucus plugs that obstructed medium- to large-sized airways was associated with higher all-cause mortality compared with patients without mucus plugging on chest CT scans.

### Silent airway mucus plugs in COPD and clinical implications [^114Rj7UQ]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Airway mucus plugs are frequently identified on CT scans of patients with COPD with a smoking history without mucus-related symptoms (ie, cough, phlegm [silent mucus plugs]).

Research Question

In patients with COPD, what are the risk and protective factors associated with silent airway mucus plugs? Are silent mucus plugs associated with functional, structural, and clinical measures of disease?

Study Design and Methods

We identified mucus plugs on chest CT scans of participants with COPD from the COPDGene study. The mucus plug score was defined as the number of pulmonary segments with mucus plugs, ranging from 0 to 18, and categorized into three groups (0, 1–2, and ≥ 3). We determined risk and protective factors for silent mucus plugs and the associations of silent mucus plugs with measures of disease severity using multivariable linear and logistic regression models.

Results

Of 4,363 participants with COPD, 1,739 had no cough or phlegm. Among the 1,739 participants, 627 (36%) had airway mucus plugs identified on CT scan. Risk factors of silent mucus plugs (compared with symptomatic mucus plugs) were older age (OR, 1.02), female sex (OR, 1.40), and Black race (OR, 1.93) (all P values < .01). Among those without cough or phlegm, silent mucus plugs (vs absence of mucus plugs) were associated with worse 6-min walk distance, worse resting arterial oxygen saturation, worse FEV 1% predicted, greater emphysema, thicker airway walls, and higher odds of severe exacerbation in the past year in adjusted models.

Interpretation

Mucus plugs are common in patients with COPD without mucus-related symptoms. Silent mucus plugs are associated with worse functional, structural, and clinical measures of disease. CT scan-identified mucus plugs can complement the evaluation of patients with COPD.

### Plugs of the air passages: a clinicopathologic review [^113JBXVP]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Although mucus is a normal product of the tracheobronchial tree, some diseases of the respiratory tract are characterized by unusually thick (inspissated) forms of mucus that accumulate within the airways. These are known as mucus plugs. The pathologic composition of these plugs is surprisingly diverse and, in many cases, correlates with distinctive clinical, radiologic, and bronchoscopic findings. The best-known conditions that involve mucus plugs are allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, plastic bronchitis, and asthma. Other lung diseases occasionally associated with plugs within the airways include Aspergillus tracheobronchitis, hyper-IgE syndrome, exogenous lipoid pneumonia, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. In this review, we describe and illustrate the bronchoscopic, pathologic, and imaging findings in respiratory disorders characterized by mucus plugs or plugs composed of other similar materials. Recognition of the characteristic appearance and differential diagnosis of mucus plugs will hopefully facilitate diagnosis and management of these diseases.

### Clinical associations of mucus plugging in moderate to severe asthma [^117WQFLB]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Mucus plugging is recognized as a contributory factor to airway obstruction and symptoms in persistent asthma.

Objective

We aimed to determine phenotypic associations of mucus plugging in patients with moderate to severe asthma in a real-life clinic setting.

Methods

Mucus plugs (MPs) were identified by a thoracic radiologist upon high-resolution computed tomography imaging. A MP score was subsequently calculated and analyzed along with type 2 biomarkers, spirometry, severe exacerbations, and asthma control for 126 patients with moderate to severe asthma before biologic therapy.

Results

Asthma patients with MP had significantly worse FEV 1%, forced expiratory flow at 25% to 75% of FVC percent, and FEV 1 /FVC as well as higher levels of peripheral blood eosinophils, FeNO, total IgE, and Aspergillus fumigatus IgE titers, and had previously experienced more frequent severe exacerbations. FEV 1 /FVC, more than two exacerbations per year, blood eosinophils, total IgE, and A fumigatus IgE titers were associated with MPs after adjusting for confounders.

Conclusions

Poorly controlled asthma patients with MPs exhibited significantly worse airflow obstruction and greater type 2 inflammation associated with more frequent severe exacerbations. Impaired spirometry, more frequent exacerbations, raised blood eosinophils, total IgE, and A fumigatus IgE increased the likelihood of MPs.

### Pathogenesis, imaging and clinical characteristics of CF and non-CF bronchiectasis [^115xsdb8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Imaging characteristics of bronchiectasis

Bronchiectasis is defined as irreversible dilation of bronchi in cylindrical, varicose, or a more cystic morphological appearance. In CF, it is often associated with mucus plugging, bronchial wall thickening, and small airway disease. The radiological evaluation of bronchiectasis is based on definition published in the terms for thoracic imaging of the Fleischner Society: " Morphologic criteria on thin-section CT scans include bronchial dilatation with respect to the accompanying pulmonary artery (signet ring sign), lack of tapering of bronchi, and identification of bronchi within 1 cm of the pleural surface". The so-called signet ring sign is the primary sign for bronchiectasis representing a ring-shaped opacity, whereas the smaller adjacent artery stays for the signet. According to this concept, the extent of bronchial dilation can be quantified using the ratio between bronchi and vessels, an approach challenged by a recent pediatric study. On HRCT, the bronchial tree is only visible up to the 6–8th generation. CT findings like the tree-in-bud sign and centrilobular opacity are linked to small airway disease with dilation and inflammation of the ronchiole or mucus plugging in its periphery (Fig. 2). There are differences in CF bronchiectasis depending on pancreas insufficiency (PI), with PI patients illustrating more severe bronchiectasis. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) patients have similar CT scores as pancreatic-sufficient (PS) CF patients, but in contrast to CF, no correlation between structural change and clinical parameters has been detected in a previous study. However, recent studies in adult PCD patient cohorts indicate that CT findings relate to lung function changes. There are no clear identifiers of pre-bronchiectasis in imaging. However, mucus plugging has been shown to be a common precursor in CF.

### Reply to polverino: clearing the air: innovations in imaging for early detection and management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116oen3V]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Questions were raised regarding the representability of ex vivo measures compared with in vivo computed tomography, especially regarding the inflation and fixation of the lung. Although a certain effect of manipulation cannot be excluded, the main findings derived from the ex vivo CT (i.e. the degree of emphysema) showed strong correlation among the two radiologic observers. In addition, our standardized approach rules out effects of inadequate inspiration, motion artifacts, and confounding rib cage, leading to a better resolution of the lung. The workup is uniform in all cases, so if there would be an impact of inflation and manipulation on our results, this is expected to be uniform across the different groups.

We did not find evidence for an increase in mucus plugging on ex vivo CT, in contrast to a recent study demonstrating a disease severity stage–dependent increase in mucus plugging in COPD. However, a few things are worth considering. This study was based on 4,363 participants and used a scoring system based on 18 lung segments. For most patients, we only had a single lobe available for analysis, and the section of the lung bearing the tumor for which surgery was indicated was removed before analysis. Because of these differences in protocol and n-value, we believe our study was not powered to detect differences regarding mucus plugging. In addition, the radiologists had poor correlations between their assessment of mucus plugging, indicating that more focused studies with dedicated scoring systems are warranted to further investigate mucus plugging in (pre-)COPD, which was outside the scope of the current study. The fact that mucus plugging was present in some of our patients with pre-COPD further corroborates that more detailed studies are needed. It was also speculated that there could be a different nature of the mucus plugs, which definitely sounds like an appealing hypothesis. However, one might also speculate that there is a spatial difference in mucus plugging, in which in the early stages the smaller airways are filled with mucus, and with increasing COPD severity more proximal airways are obstructed with mucus as there are a very limited number of small airways left, making these airways more visible with conventional chest CT scanning.

### Treatment of atelectasis: where is the evidence? [^112ppore]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Lobar atelectasis is a common problem caused by a variety of mechanisms including resorption atelectasis due to airway obstruction, passive atelectasis from hypoventilation, compressive atelectsis from abdominal distension and adhesive atelectasis due to increased surface tension. However, evidence-based studies on the management of lobar atelectasis are lacking. Examination of air-bronchograms on a chest radiograph may be helpful to determine whether proximal or distal airway obstruction is involved. Chest physiotherapy, nebulised DNase and possibly fibreoptic bronchoscopy might be helpful in patients with mucous plugging of the airways. In passive and adhesive atelectasis, positive end-expiratory pressure might be a useful adjunct to treatment.

### Radiography, tomosynthesis, CT and MRI in the evaluation of pulmonary cystic fibrosis: an untangling review of the multitude of scoring systems [^1142AQoE]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

The evolution of radiological scoring systems for pulmonary cystic fibrosis reflects a desire to translate the pathological findings in the images into numbers, in a reproducible and objective way. Clinicians are of course interested in the general disease progression, but also in the progression of a separate component, such as mucus plugging, atelectasis or consolidation since treatment then can be focused on a specific pathology with a specific therapy. Chest radiography is the most widely used imaging modality to track the progression of cystic fibrosis lung disease, since it is easy to perform and the radiation dose and cost are low. Scoring systems for tomosynthesis, CT and MRI are still mainly used for research purposes. The different modalities obviously have different abilities to detect cystic fibrosis changes, but when deciding which modality to choose in the follow-up of patients with cystic fibrosis other aspects are of course also important, such as radiation dose, cost and the possibility to perform the examination on young children without anaesthesia (Fig. 1, Table 1).

Figures from studies using different radiological scoring systems are difficult to compare, due to the different scoring components and scoring areas used by the scoring systems, and also from divergences in weighting and terminology. For example, "bronchial wall thickening" may also be called "bronchial line shadows", "linear markings" or "peribronchial thickening". Chest CT and tomosynthesis obviously have a greater ability to detect early abnormalities that may have similar appearances on radiography, there reflected in radiographic scoring terms such as "nodular cystic lesions", whereas CT and tomosynthesis scoring systems may differentiate these lesions into "mucus plugging" and "bronchiectasis". MRI, on the other hand, is more sensitive to mucus plugging compared with CT, but cannot evaluate air trapping or differentiate between bronchial wall thickening and bronchiectasis (Table 1).

### Pathogenesis, imaging and clinical characteristics of CF and non-CF bronchiectasis [^111RwamM]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical value

Standardized reporting of cross-sectional imaging by scoring systems is suitable for several reasons: (a) to assess and to quantify individual progression of lung damage in comparison or complementary to lung function testing, (b) to use total or partial score values as endpoints for interventional studies, and (c) to establish predictive imaging biomarkers. Most CT scoring systems use a semiquantitative scale for the extent and severity of specific findings either based on lobe, involved bronchopulmonary segments, or using an overlay grid. According to the disease-specific prevalence from the imaging abnormalities, sub-scores for bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening are more heavily weighted (1, 2). Inter-observer and intra-observer agreement of the common CT scores has shown to be good to excellent. Comparable reproducibility has also been found for MRI using CT or MR-specific adapted scoring systems in small numbers of studies. For semiautomatic evaluation of bronchi dimension excellent inter-observer agreement has been found particularly for the bronchial lumen. On the other hand, mucus can obscure or mimic bronchial wall thickening. Apart from reproducibility, the weighting of abnormalities within the scores, and validation are even more challenging and related to the purpose and the use of score (e.g. interventional or clinical study). As aforementioned imaging is more sensitive than FEV1 particularly in mild disease, and, in assessment of disease progression. In this context scoring of bronchiectasis particularly in the lung periphery is important, whereas air trapping, mosaic perfusion, and mucus plugging seem to be more sensitive markers than CT or MRI which detect effects of interventions. The role of bronchiectasis as a robust predictive marker has been shown in several longitudinal observations. The extent of bronchiectasis at baseline can predict the number of respiratory tract exacerbations (RTE), and the change of the subscore in a two year follow up is strongly associated with numbers of RTEs where FEV1 did not provide value. This has been similarly described for a decade long observational study. In an older study, a maximum combined score for bronchiectasis and emphysema on HRCT was indicative of a poorer prognosis. In a recent study of patients with severe lung disease awaiting lung transplantation, the combined score of bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening, mucus, and consolidation was associated with mortality.

### Functional respiratory imaging in relation to classical outcome measures in cystic fibrosis: a cross-sectional study [^1136dTtv]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Besides air trapping, the distribution of pulmonary blood volume correlated with multiple respiratory outcomes. Pulmonary vascular disease as a result of hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction is recognized as a predictor of morbidity and mortality in CF, but investigation of pulmonary hypertension has been primarily limited to those with advanced lung disease. The results of our study suggest a redistribution of blood related to ventilation defects caused by for example mucus plugging. An average increase in pulmonary vascular resistance in patients with more severe lung disease is indicated by a relative shift of blood volume from smaller to larger blood vessels. These results, however, should be interpreted with caution, since the automated segmentation of the pulmonary vasculature was probably biased by the presence of mucus plugs and other opacities. Mucus plugs can present as tubular structures with a similar density compared to blood vessels, which could have led to false positives. This would explain the positive correlation between the total blood volume and the CF-CT score for mucus plugs and parenchymal abnormalities. To what extent the mucus plugs and areas of consolidation biased the vascular parameters should be verified by more in-depth analyses. For that reason, a follow-up study will be conducted combining chest CT with intravenous contrast to objectively quantify any misclassifications and to adapt the algorithms accordingly if needed.

### Persistent airway plugs: a call for clinical recognition and novel therapies [^1165VE5n]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Mucus plugs observed on CT were discovered to be a persistent asthma phenotype. This is supported by the observation that 82% of people with asthma with airway mucus plugs reported on their baseline CT also had mucus plugs on their follow-up scan acquired 3 years later. A less compelling but similar observation was made at the level of the bronchopulmonary segment, where 65% of segments with mucus plugs at baseline were reported to have mucus plugs at follow-up. Without additional time points, it is unknown if the plugs truly persisted in the same location throughout the duration of the study or if they resolved and reoccurred. Regardless, the segmental agreement across two time points implicates the local airway environment in the formation of mucus plugs and perhaps a vicious feedback mechanism.

The urgent need to reduce the burden of airway mucus is underscored by the observation that mucus is an important and perhaps dominant contributor to airflow obstruction, asthma severity, and control. Temporal changes in the mucus plug score were associated with changes in airflow obstruction measured by FEV 1% predicted, FVC% predicted, and FEV 1 /FVC. These global structure–function associations reported by Tang and colleagues are supported by elegant magnetic resonance imaging studies that visualize the functional consequence of an individual mucus plug on distal airflow obstruction. Taken together, there is now compelling evidence supporting a causal role for mucus plugs as a major mechanism of airflow obstruction in asthma.

Methods

Study design and population

This study cross-sectionally analyzed data sets from 2 cohorts including (1) an ongoing single-center cohort that prospectively enrolled patients with asthma without clinical diagnosis of bronchiectasis and underwent U-HRCT scans during exacerbation-free stable period in an outpatient clinic of Kyoto University Hospital in Japan between 2023 and 2024 (Kyoto cohort) and (2) the BEXAS cohort, a nationwide survey that retrospectively enrolled patients with refractory asthma with bronchiectasis between 2015 and 2019. Details of inclusion and exclusion criteria of the bronchiectasis and asthma (BEXAS) cohort are provided in this article's Online Repository at. In this study, to exclude allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis/mycosis (ABPA/ABPM), patients who had results of Aspergillus sensitization tests and had HRCT images suitable for mucus score evaluation were included. In the Kyoto cohort, patients with asthma, diagnosed according to the Global INitiative for Asthma guideline, underwent U-HRCT, postbronchodilator spirometry, self-reported questionnaires including Asthma Control Test (ACT)and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC), and measurements of F, white blood cell differentials, and blood IgE. In both cohorts, patients with concurrent respiratory disease other than chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a history of lung resection, ABPA/ABPM based on Asano's clinical diagnostic criteria, insufficient CT quality such as poor breath-holding during scans, or incidental abnormal CT findings such as interstitial lung abnormalities were excluded.

### The development of bronchiectasis on chest computed tomography in children with cystic fibrosis: can pre-stages be identified? [^1163Bgzd]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Previous literature showed that bronchiectasis is irreversible and therefore we excluded those 5/367 cases from further analysis. An overview of the structural lung damage (CT baseline -CT minus8) in our study period is shown in Fig. 3.

Fig. 3
Structural lung damage over time (n = 362 in 43 patients). Dark grey represents bronchiectasis, light-dark grey (area above dark grey) represents mucus plugging, grey dots represent airway wall thickening, white dots represent atelectasis/consolidation, light grey (on top) represents normal airways. CT baseline is the most recent CT

The kappa for intra-observer agreement was 0.77 and for interobserver agreement 0.48. More detailed information about the intra- and interobserver agreement is displayed in Table 1 in the on-line supplementary material.

Bronchiectasis and pre-stages (Fig. 3)

In 187 of the 362 (51.7%) ROIs bronchiectasis was persistent in all available CTs. For the remaining 175 ROIs in which development of bronchiectasis could be observed, the CT immediately preceding the first CT with bronchiectasis showed normal airways (139/175, 79.4%), mucus plugging (31/175, 17.7%), airway wall thickening (3/175, 1.7%) or atelectasis/consolidation (2/175, 1.1%).

The most commonly identified pre-stage of bronchiectasis was mucus plugging. In 23 ROIs mucus plugging turned into bronchiectasis within one CT (2 years, range 1.7–2.4). In the other eight ROIs mucus plugging persisted for two CTs (4 years, range 3.7–5.9) before progression to bronchiectasis. Mucus plugging never remained longer than three consecutive CTs, without progressing to bronchiectasis.

### Factors associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae-induced lobar pneumonia with mucus plugging and the optimal timing for bronchoalveolar lavage: a retrospective study [^116YTWy2]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The timing of BAL intervention represents another critical predictive factor in our study. ROC analysis revealed a significant association between the timing of BAL intervention and delayed resolution in LPMP patients. Airway mucus plugging caused by MMP infection is a primary contributor to impaired pulmonary ventilation and hypoxemia. This issue is particularly pronounced in patients with LP, where mucus plugs may exacerbate the condition and prolong recovery. Several studies have demonstrated that BAL intervention significantly improves therapeutic outcomes in patients with MMP-associated airway mucus plugging, especially those with prolonged disease courses or severe clinical manifestations. However, the optimal timing for BAL remains a matter of debate. Previous research has shown that BAL within 24 h of intubation benefits clinical outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients with aspiration pneumonia. Nonetheless, no studies have yet explored the optimal timing of BAL in LPMP patients. Our study is the first to identify that early BAL intervention (≤ 6 days) significantly outperforms late intervention (> 6 days) in reducing hospital stay duration and alleviating cough in LPMP patients. These findings provide critical empirical evidence to guide clinical decision-making regarding the optimal timing of BAL intervention. They further underscore the importance of BAL intervention in enhancing airway clearance and expediting recovery. Moreover, one month after intervention, the incidence of atelectasis was significantly lower, and the resolution rate of pulmonary consolidation was higher in the early intervention group. These results align with prior studies. At the 3-month follow-up, the early BAL intervention group continued to exhibit a higher consolidation resolution rate, suggesting that early BAL may accelerate the resolution of pulmonary consolidation, promote faster recovery, and reduce the risk of persistent lung injury. However, while the incidence of atelectasis and necrotizing pneumonia remained lower in the early intervention group, there was no significant difference between the two groups, indicating that early BAL intervention may not completely prevent long-term complications. This could be partly due to the relatively small sample size of our study, and further research is needed to clarify the relationship between BAL intervention and long-term complications. Additionally, in clinical practice, bronchoscopy and anesthesia in children carry inherent risks. The decision to perform early bronchoscopy should be made after careful consideration of multiple factors, including disease severity, clinical indications, and potential benefits versus risks. Therefore, while early BAL intervention may aid in faster recovery, its necessity in each case should be carefully evaluated.

### Do biologic therapies decrease mucus plugging in asthma? [^116AmRck]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma researchers have long recognized that abnormal mucus production and clearance play a role in the pathophysiology of asthma. 1 Mucus plugs are known to be common in patients with severe asthma, and mucus plug scores, for which higher scores indicate more severe plugging, are directly correlated with airflow obstruction and markers of eosinophilic airway inflammation (i.e., higher scores or marker levels are associated with more severe obstruction). Other work has shown that mucus plugs were associated with distal deficits in regional ventilation as delineated by hyperpolarized gas magnetic resonance imaging. 2,3.

### British thoracic society guideline for bronchiectasis in adults [^115KWo3Q]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

Summary of recommendations and good practice points

How should the diagnosis of bronchiectasis be determined?

Recommendations – Imaging

Perform baseline chest X-ray in patients with suspected bronchiectasis (D).
Perform a thin-section CT to confirm a diagnosis of bronchiectasis when clinically suspected (C).
Perform baseline imaging during clinically stable disease as this is optimal for diagnostic and serial comparison purposes (D).

Good practice points

CT imaging protocol

The most appropriate imaging protocol will vary according to scanner technology and patient factors.
When using volumetric CT, dose-reduction techniques including adaptive milliampere and kilovolt and iterative reconstruction should be used where available.
Typical CT imaging parameters for the diagnosis of bronchiectasis are: Slice thickness: ≤ 1 mm. Reconstruction algorithm: high spatial frequency. kVp: 100–140. mAs (or effective mAs): 100–200. Gantry rotation time: < 0.5 s.

CT features of bronchiectasis

Bronchiectasis is defined by bronchial dilatation as suggested by one or more of the following: Bronchoarterial ratio > 1 (internal airway lumen vs adjacent pulmonary artery). Lack of tapering. Airway visibility within 1 cm of costal pleural surface or touching mediastinal pleura.

The following indirect signs are commonly associated with bronchiectasis: Bronchial wall thickening. Mucus impaction. Mosaic perfusion/air trapping on expiratory CT.

General

CT scanning can also aid in identifying an aetiology of bronchiectasis, for example Allergic broncho pulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), Non tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), primary ciliary dyskinesia, alpha one antitrypsin deficiency, Williams-Campbell syndrome and a foreign body.

### Radiography, tomosynthesis, CT and MRI in the evaluation of pulmonary cystic fibrosis: an untangling review of the multitude of scoring systems [^115nNyHC]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The first radiographic scoring system for pulmonary cystic fibrosis was presented in 1958. Since then a multitude of scoring systems for radiography and computed tomography (CT) have been presented, recently also for tomosynthesis and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The aim of the current review was to analyse and compare the plethora of scoring systems for cystic fibrosis, especially regarding which scoring components are considered most important.

Methods

Four scoring systems for chest radiography, one for tomosynthesis, eight for CT and one for MRI were compared regarding components evaluated and their terminology; the areas scored; scoring levels; the weighting of each component in percentage of the total score; and the calculations for the final score.

Results

In most radiological scoring systems the lungs are evaluated for increased volume, bronchial wall thickening, bronchiectasis, mucus plugging, atelectasis and consolidation. In addition, for instance abscesses, bullae, septal thickening, mosaic perfusion, ground glass opacities and air trapping are evaluated in some CT scoring systems. Pleural affection and perfusion defects are scored on MRI.

Conclusions

Bronchiectasis alone, or in combination with mucus plugging, is given the highest weighting in most scoring systems and is thus commonly considered to be the most significant finding when evaluating cystic fibrosis lung disease.

Teaching Points

- Scoring of examinations is used for comparison of outcome in studies.
- Scoring of examinations can also be used for monitoring disease progression.
- Cystic fibrosis can be scored on radiography, tomosynthesis, CT or MRI.
- The typical imaging findings of cystic fibrosis depend on the imaging modality used.
- Bronchiectasis is commonly considered the most significant finding when scoring cystic fibrosis.

### Primary immunodeficiency diseases of adults: a review of pulmonary complication imaging findings [^112a9mA8]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Although early intervention withprophylactic antibiotics and/or IGRT can prevent respiratory infections and pulmonary disease morbidity and mortality, chronic lung disease progresses in many PAD patients. Recurrent infections may instigate a chronic inflammatory response inducing airway hyperreactivity (asthma) and remodeling (bronchial wall-thickening and bronchiectasis), and eventually, irreversible obstruction due to small-airway disease (obliterative bronchiolitis). The most prevalent PAD-associated radiological manifestation is bronchiectasis associated with small airway disease The three morphological bronchiectasis types (cylindrical, varicose, and cystic) reflect increasingly severe bronchial disease and its progression to the more central airway. Bronchiectasis may affect one or more lobes, involving segmental and/or subsegmental bronchi possibly associated with loss of lobe/segment volume (atelectasis) (Fig. 1 a, b). Dilated bronchi may contain retained secretions (mucous-plugging, air-fluid levels). Distal mucoid impaction may manifest as parenchymal centrilobular and tree-in-bud nodularity. The other associated findings include bronchial wall-thickening that may precede bronchiectasis onset, areas of lung hypoattenuation, mosaic perfusion pattern (Fig. 1 c), and expiratory air-trapping reflecting small-airway obstruction. A multicenter study on the European Chest CT Group cohort included CT data from 232 CVID patients, 28 XLA patients, and 22 patients with other PAD, 80% of patients had radiological evidence of some form of bronchial pathology including bronchiectasis (61%), bronchial wall-thickening (44%), atelectasis (32%) and/or mucus-plugging (29%). The prevalence of bronchiectasis and mucus plugging, but not of bronchial wall thickening, were higher in the XLA cohort as compared to the CVID cohort (Fig S3). Patients with less severe forms of PAD, such as IgG subclass deficiency, IgAD, and specific antibody deficiency, may also have an increased risk of bronchiectasis (Fig S4).

### Clinical and pathophysiological roles of lower lobe-dominant mucus plugs on computed tomography in patients with asthma with and without bronchiectasis [^117U8s6p]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the clinical relevance of mucus plugging, the role of spatial distribution of mucus plugs remains unclear in patients with asthma.

Objective

We sought to examine whether greater lower lobe mucus plug dominance is associated with more clinical and pathophysiological impairments in 2 cohorts, including patients with and without bronchiectasis.

Methods

Patients with asthma without and with clinical diagnosis of bronchiectasis underwent chest computed tomography at Kyoto University Hospital (Kyoto cohort) and Japanese multicenters (bronchiectasis and asthma [BEXAS] cohort), respectively. Mucus plugs in airways were visually scored on computed tomography, and the difference in mucus plug score between lower and upper-middle lobes (Δ mucus plug score) was calculated.

Results

Among 176 (Kyoto) and 42 (BEXAS) enrolled patients, 82 and 33 exhibited mucus plug scores greater than or equal to 1, respectively. Higher Δ mucus plug score was associated with lower percentage of the predicted FEV 1 and the presence of exacerbation history in both cohorts. Higher Δ mucus plug score was associated with luminal narrowing of the fifth-generation, but not the third- or fourth-generation, lower lobe airways in the Kyoto cohort, and bronchiolitis score in the BEXAS cohort. In the multivariable model, higher Δ mucus plug score was associated with symptoms and exacerbations, independent of whole-lung mucus plug score in the Kyoto cohort.

Conclusions

Lower lobe–dominant mucus plugs were associated with lower lung function and exacerbations in patients with asthma, irrespective of comorbid bronchiectasis. The spatial distribution of mucus plugs additionally to whole-lung mucus plug score may help to understand clinical roles of mucus plugging in asthma.

### Persistent airway plugs: a call for clinical recognition and novel therapies [^116r1ryZ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Much has been written about mucus accumulation and plugging of the airway lumen as pathologic features of asthma. Sir William Osler (1849–1919) made early clinical descriptions of "gelatinous mucus expectoration by asthmatics" that were subsequently recognized in pathological specimens by Huber and Koessler, Dunnill, and many others. Despite this, the role of intraluminal mucus in the clinical presentation of asthma, and its contribution to airflow obstruction, have not been extensively studied. Further, very little attention has been made by most international guidelines to recognize or treat mucus impaction of the airways in asthma, nor is it considered in daily clinical practice. This has likely been in part owing to our inability to directly measure airway mucus plugging in vivo, with most of our knowledge gained from postmortem pathology.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^116Lu7Ny]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic mucus hypersecretion and chronic bronchitis in COPD are linked to adverse clinical outcomes; radiographic mucus plugging may persist despite a lack of chronic bronchitis (CB) symptoms and is associated with greater airflow obstruction, lower oxygen saturation, poorer exercise tolerance, more exacerbations, worsened quality of life and all-cause mortality. A high index of suspicion for mucus hypersecretion should be maintained in all patients with COPD. In adults less than 50 years of age, CB without airflow obstruction represents an early marker for susceptibility to the long-term risk of COPD and all-cause mortality, and in smokers between 36 to 43 years of age with chronic mucus production there was a significant higher risk of airflow obstruction but following smoking cessation mucus production returned to levels observed amongst never smokers. The longer chronic mucus hypersecretion is present, the greater the concurrent decrease in FEV1, and among current smokers sputum MUC5AC has been associated more specifically with increased exacerbation frequency, increased symptoms and greater lung function decline; large epidemiologic studies also report that after adjustment for height, age and smoking history, men with cough or phlegm and women with cough show accelerated loss of lung function. In the Copenhagen city heart study, chronic mucus hypersecretion was associated with pulmonary infection implicated in 54% of the deaths, and chronic mucus hypersecretion was associated with excessive FEV1 decline and increased COPD hospitalizations; in patients with advanced emphysema chronic bronchitis has been associated with increased hospitalizations and mortality, and in non-obstructive chronic bronchitis increased all-cause and respiratory disease related mortality has been reported.

### Clinical and pathophysiological roles of lower lobe-dominant mucus plugs on computed tomography in patients with asthma with and without bronchiectasis [^115D4eg1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

This study had some limitations. First, the sample sizes of the cohorts, particularly the BEXAS cohort, were relatively small. However, the associations of Δ mucus plug score with lower FEV 1 and exacerbations were detected in the 2 cohorts, suggesting the validity of the results. Second, because of inconsistent CT scanning conditions in the BEXAS cohort, we could not perform quantitative measurement of airway dimensions. Nonetheless, the associations of bronchiolitis score with Δ mucus plug score in the BEXAS cohort are consistent with the associations of WA% and LA/BSA in the fifth, but not third or fourth, generations with Δ mucus plug score in the Kyoto cohort. We believe that the CT findings in the BEXAS cohort are important because of the currently limited data on asthma with bronchiectasis, despite their clinical impact. Because of the significantly different clinical characteristics between the Kyoto and BEXAS cohorts, it is essential to reassess the findings from each cohort using a validation cohort that includes patients with more closely aligned clinical characteristics. Third, whether patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia were included in the BEXAS cohort is unclear because of lack of genotyping data. Lastly, the BEXAS cohort included cases with CT data obtained during the exacerbation period. However, the correlations between the number of exacerbations requiring antibiotics and Δ mucus plug or bronchiolitis score on stable-phase CT suggest that findings on stable-phase CT reflect chronic inflammation/infection rather than acute infection.

Conclusion

Greater lower lobe–dominant mucus plugs were associated with lower percentage of the predicted FEV 1 and exacerbations similarly in patients with asthma with and without bronchiectasis. The different involvement of type 2 inflammation with lower lobe–dominant mucus plugs between asthma with and without bronchiectasis suggest that a more individualized approach to remove mucus plugs should be considered according to the extent of bronchiectasis in patients with asthma. The observed associations of Δ mucus plug score with symptomatic burdens and exacerbations, independent of total mucus plug score, suggest the clinical relevance of CT-based identification of lower lobe–dominant mucus plugging for better management of the disease.

### The triple radiologic asthma phenotype is associated with worse disease control [^116ZTdHU]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Efforts have been made to combine radiographic biomarkers such as bronchiectasis or bronchial wall thickness (BWT) for the purpose of identifying asthma subphenotypes and their clinical implications.

Objective

Our aim was to assess whether a composite triple radiologic phenotype measured by high-resolution computed tomography comprising BWT, mucus plug score (MPS), and mediastinal lymph node (MLN) size might provide a better insight into subphenotypes in persistent asthma.

Methods

A total of 112 patients with moderate-to-severe asthma were included in this retrospective observational study. A binary method was used to classify patients according to median values for the following: a pooled mediastinal lymph node size of 3.6 mm or more; a BWT as a pooled wall area of at least 50% of the total airway area; and a mucus plug score of 1 or higher, with a mucus plug considered positive if complete bronchial obstruction was imaged more than 2 cm from a pleural surface.

Results

Patients with the triple imaging phenotype exhibited significantly worse Asthma Control Questionnaire scores, with their scores exceeding minimal clinical important difference, a higher prevalence of concomitant chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and a greater total IgE level.

Conclusion

We have demonstrated an association between poorer symptom control and the triple radiologic asthma phenotype.

### Tomosynthesis in pulmonary cystic fibrosis with comparison to radiography and computed tomography: a pictorial review [^116qLQ1D]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of this pictorial review is to illustrate chest imaging findings of cystic fibrosis (CF) using tomosynthesis (digital tomography), in comparison to radiography and computed tomography (CT). CF is a chronic systemic disease where imaging has long been used for monitoring chest status. CT exposes the patient to a substantially higher radiation dose than radiography, rendering it unsuitable for the often needed repeated examinations of these patients. Tomosynthesis has recently appeared as an interesting low dose alternative to CT, with an effective dose of approximately 0.08 mSv for children and 0.12 mSv for adults. Tomosynthesis is performed on the same X-ray system as radiography, adding only about 1 min to the normal examination time. Typical pulmonary changes in CF such as mucus plugging, bronchial wall thickening, and bronchiectases are shown in significantly better detail with tomosynthesis than with traditional radiography. In addition, the cost for a tomosynthesis examination is low compared to CT. To reduce the radiation burden of patients with CF it is important to consider low dose alternatives to CT, especially in the paediatric population. Tomosynthesis has a lower radiation dose than CT and gives a superior visualisation of pulmonary CF changes compared to radiography. It is important to further determine the role of tomosynthesis for monitoring disease progression in CF.

### Distribution of early structural lung changes due to cystic fibrosis detected with chest computed tomography [^116NyNMb]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the distribution of early structural lung changes in clinically stable infants and young children with cystic fibrosis using chest computed tomography (CT).

Study Design

This cross-sectional study included 62 children aged 1–6 years with volume-controlled volumetric chest CT scans performed under general anesthesia as part of an early surveillance program. Each lobe was scored for presence and extent of bronchiectasis, mucus plugging, and air trapping using a semiquantitative score. The topographic distribution of structural abnormalities was evaluated by comparing the presence and extent of abnormalities in different lung regions and examining relationships between components.

Results

Although bronchiectasis was most common in the right upper lobe, overall changes in lung structure were not more common or more extensive in the upper lobes. Rather, bronchiectasis was more common in the right lung (right lung 0.95, left lung 0.68, P = 0.003), and mucus plugging (upper 0.41, middle 0.41, lower 0.72, P = 0.028) and air trapping (upper 0.79, middle 0.48, lower 0.96, P < .001) were more common in the lower lobes. The extents of bronchiectasis (P < .001) and air trapping (P = 0.011) were greater in the right lung. Scans with bronchiectasis were also more likely to have coexisting mucus plugging (P = 0.008) and air trapping (P < .001).

Conclusion

Early structural lung disease is heterogeneously distributed in the lung. Quantitative scoring tools for studies using chest CT as an end point, and mechanistic studies that seek to better understand the pathogenesis of early cystic fibrosis lung disease, should take account of this differential topographic expression of disease early in life.

### Mucus plugs in medium-sized airways: a novel imaging biomarker for phenotyping chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115SAuNN]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In this issue of the Journal, Dunican and colleagues (pp.) propose a novel, simple approach to assess airway disease by quantifying mucus plugs responsible for a complete bronchial occlusion on CT images. The evaluated method consists of a bronchopulmonary segment–based scoring system, which was initially developed to study mucus plugs in patients with eosinophilia-related asthma and airflow obstruction. A total of 420 participants from the SPIROMICS (Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD) study were evaluated, including 20 never-smokers and 400 current or ex-smokers with or without airflow limitation. The authors showed that mucus plugs, which occurred in subsegmental medium-sized airways, were highly prevalent in (ex-)smokers, whereas it was relatively rare in nonsmokers. More than two-thirds of patients with COPD had a mucus plug score higher than zero; the mucus plug score was significantly higher in patients with severe and very severe airflow limitation compared with smokers with normal lung function. Importantly, only one-third of smokers with high mucus plugs had symptoms of chronic cough and sputum production, indicating that mucus plugs in medium-sized airways are often asymptomatic. Although mucus plugs and emphysema were both highly prevalent in patients with COPD, they were only weakly correlated, making it possible to explore their relative roles on airflow limitation. In analyses controlling for emphysema, airway wall thickness, and smoking pack-years, both mucus plugs and emphysema were associated with airflow limitation and peripheral oxygen saturation. Interestingly, smokers with mucus plugs had a low post-bronchodilator FEV 1 even when emphysema was absent, and the relationship between mucus plugs and lung function was strongest in smokers with limited emphysema. Compared with smokers with low mucus scores, smokers with high mucus scores had more frequent exacerbations and shorter exercise capacity. A subset of patients had data on sputum cells, and sputum neutrophils (but not sputum eosinophils) were markedly higher in patients with high mucus plug scores compared with those with low scores. Finally, stability of the mucus plugs was examined in a subset of patients by comparing CT scans at baseline and after 1 year: mucus plug scores were rather stable in individual patients, and bronchopulmonary segments with mucus plugs at baseline were usually plugged at 1 year, whereas segments that were free of plugged at baseline generally remained without plugs at 1 year.

### Mucus plugs and emphysema in the pathophysiology of airflow obstruction and hypoxemia in smokers [^116jt5MP]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale: The relative roles of mucus plugs and emphysema in mechanisms of airflow limitation and hypoxemia in smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are uncertain. Objectives: To relate image-based measures of mucus plugs and emphysema to measures of airflow obstruction and oxygenation in patients with COPD. Methods: We analyzed computed tomographic (CT) lung images and lung function in participants in the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study. Radiologists scored mucus plugs on CT lung images, and imaging software automatically quantified emphysema percentage. Unadjusted and adjusted relationships between mucus plug score, emphysema percentage, and lung function were determined using regression. Measurements and Main Results: Among 400 smokers, 229 (57%) had mucus plugs and 207 (52%) had emphysema, and subgroups could be identified with mucus-dominant and emphysema-dominant disease. Only 33% of smokers with high mucus plug scores had mucus symptoms. Mucus plug score and emphysema percentage were independently associated with lower values for FEV 1 and peripheral oxygen saturation (P < 0.001). The relationships between mucus plug score and lung function outcomes were strongest in smokers with limited emphysema (P < 0.001). Compared with smokers with low mucus plug scores, those with high scores had worse COPD Assessment Test scores (17.4 ± 7.7 vs. 14.4 ± 13.3), more frequent annual exacerbations (0.75 ± 1.1 vs. 0.43 ± 0.85), and shorter 6-minute-walk distance (329 ± 115 vs. 392 ± 117 m) (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Symptomatically silent mucus plugs are highly prevalent in smokers and independently associate with lung function outcomes. These data provide rationale for targeting patients with mucus-high/emphysema-low COPD in clinical trials of mucoactive treatments. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01969344).

### Of mucus and microbes: the sticky issue of mucin-microbiome interactions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115RehFy]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Intervention on factors that contribute to lung function decline in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has long been an important goal. A subset of patients will lose lung function at a faster pace, and addressing this disheartening trajectory is critical. The pathobiological differences that drive this trajectory remain unclear, and elucidating the mechanisms and interactions involved should enlighten interventional strategies beyond encouraging smoking cessation.

In addition to the excess production and secretion of mucins, pathologic mucus, reflective of altered biochemical and biophysical properties, is a key feature of obstructive lung diseases, including COPD. Most recognized clinically in patients with symptoms of cough and sputum production, the consequences of pathologic mucus are increasingly clear, even in nonsevere disease. Mucus plugs visualized in chest computed tomography correlate with airflow obstruction independent of emphysema and with all-cause mortality. In tobacco-exposed persons at risk for or with nonsevere COPD, higher total mucin concentrations — of MUC5AC, in particular — are linked to clinical markers of COPD and predictive of lung function decline. However, pathologic mucus alone may not be fully explanatory. Reported symptoms and clinical outcomes can vary greatly among patients, despite evidence of excess mucus, and we still do not fully comprehend what dynamics in the airway milieu buy the unfortunate patient a ticket on the express train of lung function decline.

Tomosynthesis

There is currently only one published scoring system for tomosynthesis, developed by Vult von Steyern et al. (Table 4).

Table 4
An overview of the scoring system for tomosynthesis presented by Vult von Steyern et al. adapted from the original publication

Scored abnormalities and scoring areas

Both lungs are scored for the degree of overinflation on the frontal and lateral radiographs, in comparison with reference images available on the publisher´s web site. Each lung quadrant is scored for bronchial wall thickening, parenchymal lesions (atelectasis or consolidation), number and appearance of bronchiectatic bronchi and large (> 5 mm) or small (< 5 mm) mucus plugs, using all tomosynthesis sections covering the quadrant in question.

Scoring levels

The scoring components overinflation, parenchymal lesions, bronchiectasis and mucus plugging have five scoring levels (0–4). Bronchial wall thickening has three scoring levels (0–2–4). The most severe score is 4 for all scoring components and subcomponents.

Weighting of components

The highest weighting is given bronchiectasis and mucus plugging, with 32% each of the maximum score (Table 7).

Calculations for final score

The maximum score is calculated by summation of the subscores, with a maximum total score of 100.

### Mucus plugs in the airways of asthmatic subjects and smoking status [^112UdtdC]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding the association between airway mucus plugging and airway obstruction, we found a weak but significant correlation between mucus score and FEV 1 and FEV 1 /FVC ratio. Several factors could have weakened the strength of these correlations despite using the same methodology. Firstly, exposure to cigarette smoke may have caused airflow obstruction by mechanisms other than airway mucus plugging, such as small airway inflammation or emphysema. Secondly, the severity of asthma and the use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids may have influenced these correlations. These discrepancies suggest that airway obstruction in severe asthmatics has determining factors other than mucus plugs. Furthermore, the lung subtended by these plugs is relatively small making it improbable that they are directly responsible for the overall degree of obstruction assessed by spirometry. The lack of an association with FVC, and therefore indirectly air trapping, supports the idea that mucus plugs are not causing a substantial lung volume inaccessible to inspired air. However, a relationship between mucus plugs on CT scans and ventilatory defects on MRI imaging has been reported. It is probable that they may contribute to some of the observed ventilation to perfusion mismatching. As suggested for COPD, airway mucus plugs in asthma may be considered as a phenotypic biomarker for disease severity.

Thus, it is important to emphasize that the parameters associated with the presence of these markers are multiple and may vary depending on the clinical context. In non-smoking asthmatics, the association between mucus plugs and eosinophilic inflammation is well established. In contrast, in asthmatic smokers or former smokers, an association with neutrophilic inflammation is suggested. 53% of subjects without eosinophilic inflammation in the sputum contemporary to the CT scan had at least one mucus plug. These results are consistent with a correlation between the mucus score and percentage of neutrophils in sputum in COPD subjects and an inverse correlation between the same score and the percentage of eosinophils in sputum in asthma/COPD overlap subjects. This difference suggests that the mechanisms underlying the presence of mucus plugs in the airways may be different according to the smoking status. However, it is possible that the subjects with mucus plugs had prior eosinophilic inflammation leading to the plug formation since sputum characteristics are not always stable over time.

### Human immunodeficiency virus-associated chronic lung disease in children and adolescents in Zimbabwe: chest radiographic and high-resolution computed tomographic findings [^115Awvka]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

HRCT patterns were quantified visually in 6 lobes (note that the lingula was considered as a separate lobe). The lobar extent/severity of the following HRCT abnormalities were scored semiquantitatively: (1) the extent of bronchiectasis (0, no bronchiectasis; 1, bronchiectasis in 1 or part of 1 bronchopulmonary segment; 2, bronchiectasis in > 1 bronchopulmonary segment; and 3, generalized bronchiectasis); (2) the severity of bronchiectasis (0, no airway dilatation; 0.5, trivial dilatation compared with the transverse diameter of the homologous pulmonary artery; 1, 100%–200% of that diameter; and 2, more than 200%–300% of that diameter); (3) the severity of bronchial wall thickening (0, no discernible wall thickening; 0.5, trivial wall thickening; 1, < 50% of the transverse diameter of the homologous pulmonary artery; 2, 50%–100% of the transverse diameter of the accompanying pulmonary artery); (4) the extent of centrilobular (small airway); (5) large-airway mucus plugging (both similarly scored as follows: 0, no plugging; 1, plugging in 1 or part of 1 bronchopulmonary segment; 2, plugging in > 1 bronchopulmonary segment; and 3, generalized plugging in all bronchopulmonary segments); (6) the severity of lobar volume loss (0, no volume loss; 1, mild volume loss; and 2, marked volume loss). Thus, the maximal expressible score for each of the extent of bronchiectasis, small-airway plugging, and large-airway plugging was 18, and the maximal score for severity of bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening and volume loss was 12.

After semiquantitative evaluation, the overall extent of abnormal lung in each lobe (to the nearest 5%) and the proportional extents of the following HRCT patterns (totaling 100%) were quantified: consolidation, a reticular pattern, ground-glass opacification, decreased attenuation (as a component of the mosaic attenuation pattern), emphysema, and pulmonary air cysts and nodules, with or without cavitation. Discrepant observations for the presence or absence of the radiological patterns and their distribution were resolved by consensus review. The threshold for consensus was a difference in proportional extent of abnormalities of > 20%.

### Phenotypical characteristics of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection in patients with bronchiectasis [^1152gDGL]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

NTM pulmonary disease

In a study of 32 patients with NTM pulmonary disease, the leading presenting complaints were dyspnea (n = 28), chronic cough (n = 26), chronic sputum production (n = 20), weight loss (n = 5), fever (n = 4), and chest pain (n = 5). All patients underwent high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), with the predominant findings being pulmonary cavitary lesions (n = 20), tree-in-bud pattern (n = 26), nodules (n = 28), and mucus plugging (n = 17).

Multivariate analysis

On multivariate analysis, the following variables were most significantly associated with NTM pulmonary infection in the entire bronchiectasis cohort: older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02–1.07, P = 0.001), lower body mass index (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.16–1.07, P < 0.001) and higher number of involved lobes (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.01–1.44, P = 0.04).

### Mucus plugs persist in asthma, and changes in mucus plugs associate with changes in airflow over time [^113m4WhH]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Cross-sectional analysis of mucus plugs in computed tomography (CT) lung scans in the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP)-3 showed a high mucus plug phenotype. Objectives: To determine if mucus plugs are a persistent asthma phenotype and if changes in mucus plugs over time associate with changes in lung function. Methods: In a longitudinal analysis of baseline and Year 3 CT lung scans in SARP-3 participants, radiologists generated mucus plug scores to assess mucus plug persistence over time. Changes in mucus plug score were analyzed in relation to changes in lung function and CT air trapping measures. Measurements and Main Results: In 164 participants, the mean (range) mucus plug score was similar at baseline and Year 3 (3.4 [0–20] vs. 3.8 [0–20]). Participants and bronchopulmonary segments with a baseline plug were more likely to have plugs at Year 3 than those without baseline plugs (risk ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 2.0–4.1; P < 0.001; and risk ratio, 5.0; 95% CI, 4.5–5.6; P < 0.001, respectively). The change in mucus plug score from baseline to Year 3 was significantly negatively correlated with change in FEV 1% predicted (r p = -0.35; P < 0.001) and with changes in CT air trapping measures (all P values < 0.05). Conclusions: Mucus plugs identify a persistent asthma phenotype, and susceptibility to mucus plugs occurs at the subject and the bronchopulmonary segment level. The association between change in mucus plug score and change in airflow over time supports a causal role for mucus plugs in mechanisms of airflow obstruction in asthma.

### Mucus plugs-associated gene expression identifies pathophysiology shared with chronic bronchitis [^1135KMVZ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Mucus plug formation and chronic bronchitis are manifestations of mucus pathology in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Identifying gene expression changes related to mucus pathology could provide insight into its pathogenesis.

Objectives

To investigate gene expression changes in individuals with mucus plugs, identify related biological pathways, and assess whether mucus plug-related gene expression associates with clinical features of other mucus pathologies.

Methods

We studied 290 participants from the Detection of Early Lung Cancer Among Military Personnel 2 study with mainstem bronchial brush bulk RNA-sequencing data (n = 204 discovery, n = 86 validation). We scored mucus plugging based on the number of lung segments with mucus plugs identified on chest computed tomography scans and used correlative analysis to identify differentially expressed genes and examine their association with chronic bronchitis symptoms.

Results

76 participants (37%) in the discovery set had mucus plugs. Differentially expressed genes were broadly epithelial- or immune-related. Epithelial-related genes show decreased expression of genes involved in cilia maintenance and microtubule function and increased expression of genes related to epithelial maintenance and protection. Expression patterns of epithelial-related genes are associated with chronic bronchitis symptoms. Immune-related genes are enriched for innate and adaptive pathways. Expression of immune genes varies by lung function and was more weakly associated with mucus plugs than that of epithelial-related genes. Findings were replicated in an independent validation set.

Conclusion

Several distinct gene expression patterns are linked to the presence of mucus plugs, highlighting biological pathways involved in mucus pathophysiology. Variability in gene expression suggests a spectrum of mucus pathophysiology contributes to mucus plugs and chronic bronchitis symptoms.

### Clinical and pathophysiological roles of lower lobe-dominant mucus plugs on computed tomography in patients with asthma with and without bronchiectasis [^113Byk1S]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Higher WA% and lower LA/BSA in the fifth-generation airways of the RB10 path, but not in the RB1 path or the third- and fourth-generation airways, were associated with Δ mucus plug score, but not total mucus plug score, in the Kyoto cohort. The accurate measurement of the lumen and wall sizes of the fifth-generation airways is an advantage of the use of U-HRCT in this study because conventional CT potentially causes the underestimation of the lumen size and the overestimation of the wall size of the relatively peripheral airways. In a previous conventional CT study, the presence of mucus plugs in the left lower lobe path, but not in other paths, was associated with a lower LA of the third-generation airways in the corresponding path of 33 patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Moreover, mucus plugs in airways, particularly in the seventh-generation airways or more proximal generation airways, are associated with lower FEV 1, and the removal of mucus plugs by biologics increases FEV 1 in patients with asthma. In the BEXAS cohort, we found the association of higher Δ mucus plug score with greater bronchiolitis score. This is consistent with a previous report showing that small airway disease may be critical of the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis. In subanalysis by CT timings, the statistical significance of the association between Δ mucus plug and bronchiolitis scores on stable-phase CT disappeared because of the small sample size, but the strength of the correlation was not substantially affected (ρ = 0.37; p = 0.14). Collectively, the present findings suggest that lower lobe–dominant mucus plugging may be associated with luminal narrowing and wall thickening of relatively peripheral lower lobe airways in patients with asthma.

### Mucus plugs in medium-sized airways: a novel imaging biomarker for phenotyping chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^11797sRT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The score proposed by Dunican and colleagues has the advantage of being simple to implement and reproducible. However, visual quantification remains an obstacle to large-scale studies and clinical use, as it requires time and expertise. Thanks to the development of deep learning applications in thoracic imaging, it is nevertheless hoped that the quantification of mucoid impactions can be automated, notably thanks to the improvement of airway segmentation methods.

Mucus hypersecretion appears as a therapeutic target for multiple chronic airway diseases, including severe asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis (CF), and bronchiectasis. In CF, highly effective CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulators have been developed for restoring ion transport, and these drugs have beneficial effects on lung function and clinical outcomes, presumably by improving mucociliary clearance and reducing mucus plugging in airways. Currently available drugs have limited effects on mucus in COPD, and CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulators have been proposed for targeting mucus hypersecretion in patients with COPD. However, testing for mucoactive drugs has proven challenging in patients with COPD because monitoring airway mucin may require analyses of bronchial biopsies and/or brushing. The study by Dunican and colleagues provides the opportunity to 1) select appropriate patients (those with high mucus scores) for studies assessing the effects of drugs targeting mucus hypersecretion in multiple airway diseases and 2) monitor the effects of these drugs on mucus plugging, using a noninvasive technique. The association between sputum neutrophils and mucus plugging is also interesting, as neutrophil proteases are important contributors to mucus production and secretion. Novel drugs that target neutrophil serine proteases are under evaluation in patients with bronchiectasis, and the present study provides some rationale for evaluating these drugs in patients with COPD.

Overall, the elegant study by Dunican and colleagues demonstrates the effects of mucus plugging on functional impairment in COPD and shows it is independent of that of pulmonary emphysema. The proposed quantification method for mucus plug appears to be a simple, reproducible, and promising new approach for the quantitative assessment of airway disease on CT imaging, complementary to the well-recognized quantification of pulmonary emphysema.

### CF derived scoring systems do not fully describe the range of structural changes seen on CT scans in PCD [^115oBg3e]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Structural lung changes seen on computed tomography (CT) scans in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) are currently described using scoring systems derived from CF populations. This practise assumes lung damage in the two conditions is identical, potentially resulting in a failure to identify PCD-specific changes. Our study addresses this assumption.

Methods

A total of 58 CT scans from 41 PCD patients (age 2–48 years) were examined and the presence and extent of abnormalities common in CF; bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening, atelectasis, mucous plugging, and air trapping noted. Further assessment of the PCD scans by an experienced chest radiologist identified several unique PCD specific changes.

Results

Bronchial wall thickening was the commonest abnormality seen in PCD. All abnormalities were present more often in middle and lower lobes than in upper lobes (P < 0.001). Bronchiectasis, mucus plugging, atelectasis, and air trapping were present more often in PCD than in the historic CF cohorts which formed the basis of two CF scoring systems (P < 0.05). Extensive tree-in-bud pattern of mucus plugging, thickening of interlobar, and interlobular septa, and whole lobe atelectasis were seen significantly more frequently in PCD than CF.

Conclusions

Structural changes identified on CT scans in PCD are not identical to those previously described in CF patients and suggest assessment of PCD structural changes on CT should not use CF derived scoring systems.

### Radiography, tomosynthesis, CT and MRI in the evaluation of pulmonary cystic fibrosis: an untangling review of the multitude of scoring systems [^112cxVzS]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Scored abnormalities

Combined radiographic pathology, such as nodular-cystic lesions and mottled and ring shadows, is resolved into more detail on chest CT and scored separately as mucus plugging and bronchiectasis in the CT scoring systems (Table 4). Bronchial wall thickening is also seen more clearly on CT, corresponding to radiographic scoring terms such as bronchial line shadows and linear markings. Increased lung volume is scored as emphysema or overinflation. Three of the CT scoring systems score air trapping on expiratory images (in the current review this scoring component has been included in the score for increased lung volume). The Nathanson CT scoring system scores only bronchiectasis and mucus plugging. The other chest CT scoring systems all evaluate bronchial wall thickening, bronchiectasis, mucus plugging and parenchymal lesions, with the exception of the Maffessanti system, where mucus plugging is regarded as a transient phenomenon and recorded separately from the total score. Sacculations and abscesses are scored in the Bhalla and the Helbich scoring systems. In the Shah scoring system, air-fluid levels and centrilobular nodules are scored. In the Santamaria and the Brody II systems, ground glass opacities are scored either separately or as a part of the parenchyma score. In the Santamaria scoring system, thickening of intra- and inter-lobular septa as well as acinar nodules or consolidations are scored. The Helbich system scores mosaic perfusion (Table 5).

Table 5
An overview of eight scoring systems for CT in cystic fibrosis, adapted from the original publications. In the Bhalla, Santamaria and Helbich scores, the generations of bronchial divisions involved for bronchiectasis and mucus plugging are scored separately, in this table this entity is divided between the scores for bronchiectasis and mucus plugging. In the Brody II score, air trapping is scored both for extent and appearance (subsegmental or larger). The maximum scores for the Maffessanti and the Robinson scoring systems were calculated from the data in the original publications, since they were not reported there

### Computed tomography in severe asthma assessment: a systematic review [^113NBvRb]. The Journal of Asthma (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Chest computed tomography (CT) is usually performed in patients with severe asthma (SA) to exclude concomitant conditions related to poor clinical control. Despite the growing evidence regarding the utility of CT in the characterization of morphological abnormalities and airway remodeling, its role in SA assessment is still largely unexplored. The aim of our systematic review was to evaluate published data investigating the role of chest CT in patients with SA.

Data Sources

The systematic search was conducted on the Medline database through the Pubmed search engine.

Study Selections

A total of 53 studies has been included.

Results

Quantitative CT (qCT) parameters generally differ between SA patients compared to mild to moderate asthmatic patients or healthy controls and are related to functional decline. CT parameters allow to identify image-based clusters reflecting remodeling patterns and/or air trapping features. The detection of mucus plugs is more frequent in severe eosinophilic asthma, and it is related to marked airway obstruction and ventilation defects. Benralizumab treatment appears to reduce or vanish mucus plugging. Most studies regarding CT and bronchial thermoplasty (BT) detect the usefulness of this investigation in predicting treatment response. Lastly, conflicting results surround the relation between chest CT and SA assessment in children due to also the scarcity of studies focusing on pediatric population.

Conclusions

The role of CT scans in SA is still debated. Most studies focus on the identification of CT-derived disease clusters while studies primarily evaluating the predicting role of CT scan to different biologics are lacking and could represent an interesting research area.

### Airway mucus in older people without chronic respiratory illness [^115xCs5c]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

In the normal, healthy lung, airway mucus coats the inner lining of the tracheobronchial tree and traps debris to facilitate its removal. When mucus is unusually viscous and/or if ciliary clearance is impaired, airway occlusion and obstruction can occur. Chest CT scanning provides an effort-independent and noninvasive way to visualize and quantify airway mucus plugs. In severe asthma, CT scan-visible airway mucus occlusions have been shown to be heterogenous in size and shape, which are classified as short and "stubby" or long and "stringy", and are associated with airflow obstruction, quality of life, disease severity, and ventilation defects. Mucus plugs may also be considered as treatable traits for targeted therapy in patients with severe asthma.

In a study of 22 healthy young adults, CT scan-visible mucus was observed in a single participant, but the prevalence of airway mucus plugs in older people who have no history of chronic lung disease is not well understood. Determining the prevalence of mucus occlusions in healthy individuals is important to frame expectations about mucus occlusions and response to therapy in patients. To address this knowledge gap, we evaluated older volunteers who had no chronic lung disease and determined the prevalence and upper limit of normal (ULN) of CT scan-visible mucus plugs.

### Mucus plugging as a cause of acute lobar overdistension [^115Jvnpf]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2001). Low credibility.

Acute lobar overdistension in children is usually indicative of foreign body aspiration, especially when a history of a choking episode is recalled. An unusual presentation of asthma as recurrent overdistension of the left lung in a toddler is described. The child had undergone two consecutive negative bronchoscopies with a presumptive diagnosis of foreign body aspiration; however, it was only the antiasthmatic treatment that resulted in an excellent outcome.

### Association between airway mucus plugs and risk of moderate-to-severe exacerbations in patients with COPD: results from a Chinese prospective cohort study [^1133gXnK]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Airway mucus plugs are frequently identified on CT scans of patients with COPD and are associated with worse airflow obstruction and higher mortality. However, the association between airway mucus plugs and the risk of acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) has not been extensively studied.

Research Question

Are airway mucus plugs associated with the risk of future moderate-to-severe AECOPD?

Study Design and Methods

In this prospective cohort study, we identified airway mucus plugs on CT scans of patients with COPD. Mucus plugs were scored from 0 to 18 based on the number of pulmonary segments affected and categorized into 3 groups (0, 1–3, and ≥ 4). Patients were followed for 2 years. Negative binomial regression and Cox regression were used to model the association between airway mucus plugs and moderate-to-severe AECOPD, adjusting for potential confounders.

Results

Among the 194 patients with COPD, 22%, 35%, and 43% had mucus plugs in 0, 1 to 3, and ≥ 4 pulmonary segments, respectively. During the following year, 30% of patients experienced at least 1 moderate-to-severe AECOPD, with an incidence of 12%, 25%, and 44% for patients with 0, 1 to 3, and ≥ 4 pulmonary segments with mucus plugs, respectively. In negative binomial regression, each 1-point increase in airway mucus plug score was associated with an 8.3% higher risk of moderate-to-severe exacerbation (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01–1.16; p = 0.028). In multivariate Cox regression, mucus plugs in ≥ 4 vs 0 and ≥ 4 vs 1 to 3 pulmonary segments were associated with hazard ratios of moderate-to-severe exacerbation of 5.02 (95% CI, 1.84–13.75; p = 0.002) and 2.32 (95% CI, 1.25–4.33; p = 0.008), respectively. Consistent results were observed in the subset of patients completing the 2-year follow-up (n = 150).

Interpretation

In patients with COPD, airway mucus plugs are associated with increased future risk of subsequent moderate-to-severe AECOPD.

### Current and future management of non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) in the UK [^113ptUyj]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Radiological

Radiology is a key component in the diagnosis and follow-up of NTM-PD. All patients with suspected NTM-PD should have computerised tomography (CT) imaging of the thorax, as the chest X-ray is often normal or non-specific. Examples of imaging seen with NTM infection are shown in figure 1. Systems for scoring NTM-PD radiology have been developed but are not widely used outside of research studies or specialist centres.

Axial CT image shows a cavity in the apex of the left upper lobe with adjacent satellite nodules. (B) Nodular–bronchiectatic NTM-PD. CT image from a 75-year-old female patient with MAC. Axial CT image at the carina shows bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe (arrow) with additional scattered areas of peripheral bronchiectasis, mucus plugging and centrilobular nodularity in the left upper (arrowhead) and lower lobes. (C) Nodular–bronchiectatic NTM-PD in a patient with variant cystic fibrosis who has grown MAC and M. abscessus. Axial CT image just below the carina shows widespread bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening with centrilobular nodules in the right lower lobe. Peripheral mucus plugging is a more common finding in NTM-PD and air bubbles or lucency is often seen within the mucus (arrow). There is an ancillary finding of air trapping causing lucent areas of lung. (D) Nodular–bronchiectatic NTM-PD in a patient who has MAC. There is more severe bronchiectasis in the middle lobe, which is cystic and varicose in appearance (circle).

### Unilateral lung whiteout in children: four cases and a discussion of management [^115WFMCU]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Unilateral lung whiteout is not a common pediatric chest radiograph finding, but when it is encountered, timely and accurate interpretations of the radiograph are required because life-threatening respiratory failure can be associated. Lung whiteout may result from several conditions, and the differential diagnosis has a broad range. We describe 4 pediatric patients with different etiologies of unilateral lung whiteout: a large pleural effusion, mainstem bronchial plugging with a large cast, a mediastinal tumor, and consolidation. The ultimate causal diagnosis may not be initially obvious, but valuable clues can usually be found in the conventional chest radiograph to assist with appropriate early management. Chest ultrasound provides additional information, and we recommend it as the second examination for such patients.

### The 2024 American Association for Thoracic Surgery expert consensus document: current standards in donor lung procurement and preservation [^116ZqyzB]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Intraoperative bronchoscopy during donor lung evaluation — Intraoperative bronchoscopy should be performed routinely to assess for anatomic abnormalities, clear mucus plugging, and ensure ventilation of all lobar segments. Evidence of minor amounts of aspirated gastrointestinal contents or purulent secretions that do not readily reaccumulate should not be considered an absolute contraindication to organ acceptance and should be interpreted in the context of associated friable airways, positive bronchoalveolar lavage cultures, and pneumonia on imaging. Bronchoscopic examination is a fundamental aspect of donor assessment; relying solely on the donor's initial bronchoscopy is insufficient, and the focus should be on whether purulent secretions reaccumulate after suctioning, particularly in the lower lobes, which may be indicative of a developing or worsening pneumonia.

### Clinical and pathophysiological roles of lower lobe-dominant mucus plugs on computed tomography in patients with asthma with and without bronchiectasis [^112SUTNV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study used 2 cohorts and consistently demonstrated that higher Δ mucus plug score (ie, lower lobe–dominant mucus plug score) was associated with lower percentage of the predicted FEV 1 and the presence of a history of exacerbations requiring systemic steroids in patients with asthma irrespective of comorbid bronchiectasis. Moreover, higher Δ mucus plug score was associated with greater WA% and lower LA/BSA in the fifth, but not third or fourth, generation of lower lobe airways in the Kyoto cohort and bronchiolitis score in the BEXAS cohort. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the association of greater lower lobe dominance of mucus plugging with lower lung function, exacerbations, and relatively peripheral airway disease in patients with asthma. Furthermore, the association between Δ mucus plug score and Fdiffered between the 2 cohorts, with a negative association observed in the BEXAS cohort. These findings indicate that understanding the spatial distribution of mucus plugging and its underlying inflammation is crucial for the management of asthma with or without bronchiectasis.

The total mucus plug score and Δ mucus plug score were greater in patients in the BEXAS group than in those in the Kyoto cohort, suggesting that the coexistence of bronchiectasis could facilitate mucus plugs, especially in the lower lobe airways, in asthma. Nonetheless, lower lobe–dominant mucus plugs were consistently associated with lower percentage of the predicted FEV 1 and the history of exacerbations across both cohorts. In addition, in the Kyoto cohort, symptoms assessed as ACT, dyspnea assessed as mMRC, and exacerbations were significantly associated with higher Δ mucus plug score, even after adjusting for total mucus plug score. In a single-photon emission CT study using technetium-99m labeled ultrafine carbon particles, patients with asthma exhibited a lower lobe–dominant patchy distribution of regions affected by airway closure, which may have been induced by airway inflammation, mucus plugging, and increased smooth muscle tone. Moreover, ventilation was greater in the lower lobes than in the upper lobes. It is possible that luminal occlusion by mucus plugging, particularly in the lower lobes, may decrease lower lobe ventilation, increase the extent of patchy airway closures, impair lung function, and enhance a risk of exacerbation, which further imposes symptomatic burdens in patients with asthma.

### Recent advances in asthma mucus biology and emerging treatment strategies [^113wHAR9]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To describe the recent advances in the pathobiology and treatment of mucus hypersecretion in asthma, a critical factor contributing to airway obstruction, inflammation, and impaired lung function.

Recent Findings

Significant progress has been made in understanding how mucin protein regulation, mucus viscosity, and adhesion are affected by cytokine-driven inflammation, especially interleukin-13, and defects in ion transport mechanisms. Advances in imaging techniques, such as multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and hyperpolarized gas MRI, allow for a more precise assessment of mucus plugging and associated ventilation defects. Emerging therapies, including biologicals targeting type-2 (T2) inflammation, and novel mucolytics aimed at modifying mucus properties and secretion, offer promising effects in reducing mucus in severe asthmatics.

Summary

The growing understanding of mucus biology and the development of advanced imaging and therapeutic strategies could significantly improve the management of mucus-related complications in asthma. By targeting mucus characteristics, these findings support future approaches to reduce airway obstruction, enhance lung function, and improve clinical outcomes in patients with severe asthma. A deeper understanding of the glycobiology of mucus is critical to develop new therapies.

### Radiography, tomosynthesis, CT and MRI in the evaluation of pulmonary cystic fibrosis: an untangling review of the multitude of scoring systems [^1113seRj]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Radiological scoring systems for pulmonary cystic fibrosis have been introduced to allow for a standardised and robust comparison of radiological scoring to clinical scoring and for comparison of outcomes within patient groups in different studies. The evaluation of radiological studies is more objective when using a scoring system than simply describing the abnormal imaging findings.

Typical imaging features of cystic fibrosis are overinflation, bronchial wall thickening, bronchiectasis, mucus plugging, atelectasis and consolidation. In addition, abscesses, cysts, bullae, thickened inter- or intra-lobular septa, mosaic perfusion, ground glass opacities and air-trapping can be evaluated with computed tomography (CT). Radiography is often used to follow the development of pulmonary changes in cystic fibrosis, and to detect complications of the disease. CT is the modality which offers the best combination of high contrast resolution and detailed spatial resolution about the morphological findings in cystic fibrosis, but the role of CT is under investigation. It has up to now mainly been used for research purposes, due to the comparatively high radiation dose. Recently tomosynthesis and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have appeared as alternatives to CT for more detailed evaluation of the pulmonary changes compared with radiography.

The first radiographic scoring system for pulmonary cystic fibrosis was presented by Shwachman and Kulczycki in 1958. Since then a multitude of scoring systems for radiography and CT, and recently also scoring systems for tomosynthesis (digital tomography) and MRI have been presented. The aim of the current review was to analyse and compare the plethora of scoring systems for cystic fibrosis, with focus on the differences of the imaging modalities used and scoring components considered most important.

### Clinical and pathophysiological roles of lower lobe-dominant mucus plugs on computed tomography in patients with asthma with and without bronchiectasis [^114KJsEp]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Besides the importance of spatial distribution, understanding the inflammatory milieu behind mucus formation is crucial for better management of asthma, given its heterogeneous nature. Higher Fwas associated with higher total mucus plug score, but not Δ mucus plug score, in the Kyoto cohort. The positive association between Fand total mucus plug score in patients with asthma alone is consistent with previous reports on this association and the concept that Freflects the level of IL-13 that induces mucin production from airway epithelial cells, but this association may not be restricted to the lower lobes.

In contrast, Fwas negatively associated with Δ mucus plug score in the BEXAS cohort, particularly with Δ mucus plug score obtained during the exacerbation period (Table E2), extending previous findings that lower Fis associated with bronchiectasis aloneor as a comorbid of severe asthma with productive cough. Various mechanisms may account for the lower F: nitric oxide (NO) fails to diffuse across the increased and viscous secretions in the airways or NO is consumed through reactions with reactive oxygen speciesand by denitrifying organisms, including Pseudomonas. In patients with cystic fibrosis, NO synthase expression is decreased and asymmetric dimethyl arginine level, which inhibits NO synthase activity, is increased in the lower airways. The same might occur in patients with bronchiectasis and those with asthma complicated by bronchiectasis, although further analysis is required. Moreover, lower Fwas associated with a history of exacerbations requiring antibiotics, and greater Δ mucus plug score was associated with sputum gram-negative bacteria positivity and greater CT bronchiolitis score. Therefore, the association between Δ mucus plug score and lower Fsuggests that lower lobe–dominant mucus plugs may reflect the presence of chronic bacterial infection and/or colonization in asthma with bronchiectasis. A recent report on the association between sputum microbiome and mucus plugs in stable patients with chronic obstructive airway diseases showed that an increase in the relative abundance of genus Haemophilus was associated with mucus plugging in the milieu of moderate eosinophilic inflammation. We believe that although regulating type 2 inflammation is essential, clinicians should also pay attention to avoid overuse of corticosteroid and to control bacterial colonization in the airways in management of mucus plugs in patients with asthma and comorbid bronchiectasis.

### Mucus plugs in the airways of asthmatic subjects and smoking status [^112RrHkQ]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a frequent and heterogeneous pathology comprising different clinical presentations, inflammatory pathways and endotypes. Recently, the presence of mucus plugs in the airways has been proposed as a phenotypic marker of chronic inflammatory airway diseases such as COPD and asthma. The presence of chronic mucus plugs in asthmatics airways, quantified by visual scoring of CT scan images, has been associated with increased airway obstruction, higher type 2 (T2) inflammation, and more exacerbations. These plugs persist over time and the evolution of their number is correlated with the evolution of respiratory function. Mucus plugs are also associated with inhomogeneous ventilation distribution. In asthmatics with T2 inflammation, there is considerable evidence to suggest a link between eosinophilic inflammation in sputum and the presence of mucus plugs, but the mechanism underlying the persistence of mucus plugs within the same lung segment has not been established. This feature could be explained by increased local T2 inflammation.

Local heightened T2 inflammation may be linked to the presence of Charcot-Leyden protein crystals embedded in mucus plugs. Charcot Leyden crystals have been described in the sputum of asthmatics for more than a century and are attributable to crystallization of the eosinophil protein Galectin-10 (Gal-10), formed during a specific death pathway of eosinophils, namely EETosis. Additionally, the crystals trigger innate and adaptive immune responses within the airways, serving as an adjuvant promoting T2 immunity. In vitro, the crystals can be dissolved by specific antibodies opening up a potential new therapeutic option for T2 asthma. The involvement of Charcot-Leyden crystals in chronic airway mucus plugging has not yet been studied.

Many asthmatics have neutrophilic sputum but few eosinophils. Whether mucus plugs are common in these asthmatics is less well studied. Beyond T2 inflammation, the presence of mucus plugs in the airways of asthmatics and COPD subjects has been associated with local thickening of the walls of the obstructed bronchi. Interestingly, in COPD, the presence of mucus plugs was correlated with the percentage of neutrophils in sputum and not with the eosinophils, suggesting the possibility of non-T2 factors associated with airway mucus plugging.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the association of sputum plug formation with sputum granulocyte characteristics (neutrophilic or eosinophilic), Gal-10 concentrations and the airways architecture in a cohort of well-characterized asthmatic subjects. We included a group of currently smoking asthmatics since the nature of the inflammatory response is more likely to be neutrophilic in these individuals.

### Efficacy of model-based iterative reconstruction in cystic fibrosis assessment using CT [^114CDeyr]. Clinical Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the efficacy of model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) constructed non-enhanced ultra-low dose (ULD) computed tomography (CT) of the chest to evaluate cystic fibrosis (CF) pathology.

Materials and Methods

ULD-CT was compared with chest X-ray and standard adaptive statistical iterative reconstructed (ASIR) non-enhanced low-dose CT (LD-CT). The effective radiation dose was calculated from the recorded dose-length product (DLP) values and compared between the two CT methods. Identification of pathology was compared between ULD-CT and chest X-ray. It was hypothesised that ULD-CT would be superior to chest X-ray in the identification of CF pathology at lower doses than LD-CT.

Results

The mean effective radiation dose of ULD-CT was 0.073 mSv, comparable to one chest X-ray, which was a 94% reduction compared to LD-CT. Compared to chest X-ray, ULD-CT detected on average, 2.3 more regions of bronchiectasis per study and better delineated varicose and cystic forms of bronchiectasis (p ≤ 0.0001). ULD-CT identified four-times more mucous plugging than chest X-ray (p < 0.000001) and twice the amount of consolidation (p = 0.0002).

Conclusion

ULD-CT is superior to chest X-ray in quantifying CF disease and achieves remarkable radiation doses significantly lower than LD-CT, comparable to one chest radiograph. The present results suggest that MBIR-constructed ULD-CT is an effective imaging technique for CF surveillance, with potential applications in other disease settings.

### The development of bronchiectasis on chest computed tomography in children with cystic fibrosis: can pre-stages be identified? [^114rKsXH]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Bronchiectasis is an important component of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease but little is known about its development. We aimed to study the development of bronchiectasis and identify determinants for rapid progression of bronchiectasis on chest CT.

Methods

Forty-three patients with CF with at least four consecutive biennial volumetric CTs were included. Areas with bronchiectasis on the most recent CT were marked as regions of interest (ROIs). These ROIs were generated on all preceding CTs using deformable image registration. Observers indicated whether: bronchiectasis, mucus plugging, airway wall thickening, atelectasis/consolidation or normal airways were present in the ROIs.

Results

We identified 362 ROIs on the most recent CT. In 187 (51.7%) ROIs bronchiectasis was present on all preceding CTs, while 175 ROIs showed development of bronchiectasis. In 139/175 (79.4%) no pre-stages of bronchiectasis were identified. In 36/175 (20.6%) bronchiectatic airways the following pre-stages were identified: mucus plugging (17.7%), airway wall thickening (1.7%) or atelectasis/consolidation (1.1%). Pancreatic insufficiency was more prevalent in the rapid progressors compared to the slow progressors (p = 0.05).

Conclusion

Most bronchiectatic airways developed within 2 years without visible pre-stages, underlining the treacherous nature of CF lung disease. Mucus plugging was the most frequent pre-stage.

Key Points

- Development of bronchiectasis in cystic fibrosis lung disease on CT.

- Most bronchiectatic airways developed within 2 years without pre-stages.

- The most frequently identified pre-stage was mucus plugging.

- This study underlines the treacherous nature of CF lung disease.

### Clinical and pathophysiological roles of lower lobe-dominant mucus plugs on computed tomography in patients with asthma with and without bronchiectasis [^116BZZTa]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Of the 197 patients initially enrolled, 22 were excluded because of ABPA/ABPM, active bacterial pneumonia, history of lung lobectomy, and poor quality CT images, and 176 with asthma without a clinical diagnosis of bronchiectasis were included in the Kyoto cohort. Of the 67 patients in the BEXAS cohort who had Aspergillus sensitization test and CT image results, 25 were excluded because the slice thickness (≥ 2.0 mm) of the CT images was inappropriate for accurate mucus plug evaluation, and 42 with asthma with bronchiectasis but not ABPA/ABPM were included in this study. Among them, 82 and 33 patients in the Kyoto and BEXAS cohorts, respectively, had at least 1 mucus plug on CT and thus were included in subsequent analyses. Their characteristics are provided in Table I. As shown in Fig 1, the rate of mucus plug presence was greater in the BEXAS group than in the Kyoto cohort (78.6% vs 46.6%; p = 0.0002). For patients with mucus plugs, the Δ mucus plug score was greater in the BEXAS cohort than in the Kyoto cohort (median, 2.00 vs 0.50; p = 0.001). The mucus plug score in the whole lung (total mucus plug score) was significantly correlated with the Δ mucus plug score in both the Kyoto and BEXAS cohorts (rs = 0.43 and 0.43, respectively). In the BEXAS study, timings of CT scans were available for 28 patients with mucus plugs: 17 underwent scans during the stable period and 11 during exacerbations. Because total mucus plug, Δ mucus plug, and bronchiolitis scores were comparable between the stable and exacerbation phases (see Table E1 in this article's Online Repository at), data obtained during both phases were analyzed together. Separate analyses for the stable and exacerbation periods are presented in Table E2 (in the Online Repository available at).

### Bronchoscopy assisting-2007 revision&update [^114f28uA]. AARC (2007). Medium credibility.

Bronchoscopy assisting — indications — Indications include the presence of lesions of unknown etiology on the chest radiograph film or the need to evaluate recurrent pneumonia, persistent atelectasis or pulmonary infiltrates; the need to assess patency or mechanical properties of the upper airway; and the need to investigate hemoptysis, persistent unexplained cough, dyspnea, localized wheeze, or stridor, as well as suspicious or positive sputum cytology results. Additional indications include the need to obtain lower respiratory tract secretions, cell washings, and biopsies for cytologic, histologic, and microbiologic evaluation; to determine the location and extent of injury from toxic inhalation or aspiration; to evaluate problems associated with endotracheal or tracheostomy tubes (tracheal damage, airway obstruction, or tube placement); to aid in performing difficult intubations or percutaneous tracheostomies; suspicion that secretions or mucus plugs are responsible for lobar or segmental atelectasis; the need to remove abnormal endobronchial tissue or foreign material by forceps, basket, or laser; the need to retrieve a foreign body (although under most circumstances, rigid bronchoscopy is preferred); therapeutic management of endobronchial toilet in ventilator associated pneumonia; achieving selective intubation of a main stem bronchus; the need to place and/or assess airway stent function; and the need for airway balloon dilatation in treatment of tracheobronchial stenosis.

### Radiography, tomosynthesis, CT and MRI in the evaluation of pulmonary cystic fibrosis: an untangling review of the multitude of scoring systems [^115vSUFH]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

For all scoring systems, a defined total score which should represent the total structural lung damage has been reported in the articles, except for the scoring systems of Maffessanti and Robinson. It has been shown that inter-observer reproducibility is higher for the total score than for the component scores for most CT scoring systems as well as for the tomosynthesis scoring system.

The range of the weightings, expressed as the component score in percentage of the total score, is wide (Table 7, Fig. 2), indicating disagreement between research groups on which abnormalities are the most indicative of changes in disease status. Bronchiectasis and mucus plugging are the most specific pulmonary abnormalities for cystic fibrosis and some authors have even suggested that selective scoring of mucus plugging and bronchiectasis might be as sensitive as more complicated CT scoring systems in observing the course of disease in patients with cystic fibrosis. It is therefore logical to give them a high score compared with other findings, and most scoring systems give bronchiectasis alone, or in combination with mucus plugging, the highest weightings. Bronchiectasis is generally given higher weightings in CT and MRI scoring systems (when combined with scores for abscess and sacculation), as well as in the tomosynthesis scoring system, compared with radiographic scoring systems (Table 7, Fig. 2), probably due to the fact that bronchiectasis is more clearly visualised. The mean scores for mucus plugging (17%) are the same for radiography, CT and MRI scoring systems, even though CT and MRI depict these changes better than radiography, but is higher in the tomosynthesis scoring system (32%), where the sum of the scores for mucus plugging together with bronchiectasis contribute to 64% of the total score.

### Clinical and pathophysiological roles of lower lobe-dominant mucus plugs on computed tomography in patients with asthma with and without bronchiectasis [^113FuV3A]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

CT image analyses

Airway mucus plugs were identified and scored without knowledge of clinical information by visual inspection by 2 pulmonary physicians according to a scoring system based on bronchopulmonary segment anatomy. The mucus plug scores obtained by the 2 inspectors were averaged for the whole lung, upper-middle lobes (right upper and middle lobes and left upper lobe), and lower lobes (right and left lower lobes). Details are presented in the Online Repository. The Δ mucus plug score was calculated by subtracting the score of the upper-middle lobes from the score of the lower lobes. The range of Δ mucus plug scores was from −9 to +9. A higher Δ mucus plug score indicated more dominant mucus plugs in the lower lobes.

In the BEXAS cohort, chest CT data obtained during the exacerbation-free stable period as well as during exacerbations were included. Mucus plugs were assessed across all bronchopulmonary segments, including those with bronchiectasis. Bronchiolitis and degree of bronchodilatation were also scored. Bronchiolitis was defined as the presence of centrilobular nodules or tree-in-bud signs in 1 or more lobes, and its severity was assessed by counting the number of affected lobes, ranging from 0 to 5. The degree of bronchodilatation was assessed using the modified Reiff score.

In the Kyoto cohort, lumen area (LA) and wall area (WA) were measured at all identifiable branches of the third (segmental), fourth (subsegmental), and fifth (sub-subsegmental) generations of the right apical (RB1) and posterior basal (RB10) paths. The WA% was calculated as the percentage of WA to the sum of WA and LA.LA was normalized by body surface area (BSA).

### Pilot study to determine whether reduced-dose photon-counting detector chest computed tomography can reliably display brody II score imaging findings for children with cystic fibrosis at radiation doses that approximate radiographs [^113CcFPE]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The Brody II score uses chest CT to guide therapeutic changes in children with cystic fibrosis; however, patients and providers are often reticent to undergo chest CT given concerns about radiation.

Objective

We sought to determine the ability of a reduced-dose photon-counting detector (PCD) chest CT protocol to reproducibly display pulmonary disease severity using the Brody II score for children with cystic fibrosis (CF) scanned at radiation doses similar to those of a chest radiograph.

Materials and Methods

Pediatric patients with CF underwent non-contrast reduced-dose chest PCD-CT. Volumetric inspiratory and expiratory scans were obtained without sedation or anesthesia. Three pediatric radiologists with Certificates of Added Qualification scored each scan on an ordinal scale and assigned a Brody II score to grade bronchiectasis, peribronchial thickening, parenchymal opacity, air trapping and mucus plugging. We report image-quality metrics using descriptive statistics. To calculate inter-rater agreement for Brody II scoring, we used the Krippendorff alpha and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).

Results

Fifteen children with CF underwent reduced-dose PCD chest CT in both inspiration and expiration (mean age 8.9 years, range, 2.5–17.5 years; 4 girls). Mean volumetric CT dose index (CTDI vol) was 0.07 ± 0.03 mGy per scan. Mean effective dose was 0.12 ± 0.04 mSv for the total examination. All three readers graded spatial resolution and noise as interpretable on lung windows. The average Brody II score was 12.5 (range 4–19), with moderate inter-reader reliability (ICC of 0.61 [95% CI = 0.27, 0.84]). Inter-rater reliability was moderate to substantial for bronchiectasis (0.52), peribronchial thickening (0.55), presence of opacity (0.62) and air trapping (0.70) and poor for mucus plugging (0.09).

Conclusion

Reduced-dose PCD-CT permits diagnostic image quality and reproducible identification of Brody II scoring imaging findings at radiation doses similar to those for chest radiography.

### The development of bronchiectasis on chest computed tomography in children with cystic fibrosis: can pre-stages be identified? [^114uodfh]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

CT analysis

According to the definition of the validated CF-CT scoring system, bronchiectasis is present if the bronchial lumen diameter is larger than the adjacent pulmonary artery outer diameter, or if there is a lack of tapering for at least 2 cm distal to a branching point. Based on literature about the pathophysiology of bronchiectasis and based on the expertise of a panel consisting of a paediatric pulmonologist (HT), a radiologist (PC), a biomedical imaging expert (MB) and a PhD student (LT), five mutually exclusive categories for classifying pre-stages of bronchiectasis were defined. These categories were: (1) bronchiectasis (bronchial lumen diameter is larger than the adjacent pulmonary artery outer diameter, or lack of tapering for at least 2 cm, Fig. 1), (2) mucus plugging (filling of clearly identifiable bronchi, Fig. 1), (3) airway wall thickening (ratio between the bronchial wall thickness and the outer diameter of the adjacent pulmonary artery being more than 33%, Fig. 1), (4) atelectasis or consolidation and (5) normal airways. These categories are well defined as part of the CF-CT scoring system and are further explained in the on-line supplementary material.

Fig. 1
Illustration of scoring categories: bronchiectasis (left), mucus plugging (middle) and airway wall thickening (right)

CTs were de-identified and randomized. One observer (observer 2: DZ) encircled all areas with bronchiectasis (bronchial lumen diameter-pulmonary artery outer diameter ratio > 2 or saccular bronchiectasis) in the most recent volumetric inspiratory CT (CT baseline). Those areas were marked as a region of interest (ROI) using tools in our image analysis platform (®Myrian Onco XL, Intrasense, France). By using deformable image registration, the same areas were automatically identified in the previous CTs (CT minus2-minus8). All preceding ROIs were assessed by two experienced observers with respectively 1 and 2 years of experience (HO and DZ) and assigned to one of the five above-mentioned categories. Category 2–5 reflects a potential pre-stage in the ROI of the bronchiectatic airway observed on the most recent CT.

ROIs were assessed in random order with respect to patients and order of CT scans (CT minus2-minus8). Therefore, the observers had no knowledge of the assigned category of the ROIs in previous or later scans.

### Total unilateral pulmonary collapse secondary to allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: a case series of an unusual cause of complete atelectasis [^115U8NzP]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In this context, the diagnosis of ABPA may be supported by the presence of typical radiologic findings. The most common CT-scan findings are mucoid impactions and bronchiectasis predominantly involving the segmental and subsegmental bronchi of the upper lobes, with centrilobular nodules. In case of total unilateral lung collapse, these imaging findings should be investigated in the contralateral lung. A CT scan was performed in three of our patients. Unfortunately, only one had imaging findings consistent with ABPA in the contralateral lung that could have guided the diagnosis. In the other cases, bronchoscopy was first performed rather than a CT scan because the clinical and biological findings strongly suggested the diagnosis of ABPA, especially in the two patients with a history of ABPA.

The diagnosis of ABPA is always challenging in patients with total lung collapse, in the absence of a preexisting respiratory condition and other characteristic findings on the CT scan. Many criteria have been proposed over the years with different diagnostic algorithms but there is a lack of consensus for standardized criteria. When a patient present with total lung collapse associated with clinical and biological findings consistent with ABPA, we recommend to use the 10-component diagnostic criteria for ABPA/ABPM proposed by Asano et al. Flexible bronchoscopy should be considered when lung collapse is associated with respiratory distress, with the objective of removing obstructive mucus plugs. Besides, the endoscopic aspect of the mucus may be helpful for the diagnosis, and Asano et al. have retained this criterion in their recent criteria for ABPA/ABPM. Interestingly, the use of a cryoprobe may increase the likelihood of successfully removing the plugs, as shown here in one patient.

### Airway disease on chest computed tomography of preschool children with cystic fibrosis is associated with school-age bronchiectasis [^115oGjuw]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by chronic airway inflammation and infection, leading to early structural changes of the airways, such as airway wall thickening and mucus plugging. 1, 2, 3 These changes are thought to lead to the development of bronchiectasis, which is defined as an irreversible widening of the airway. 2

Chest computed tomography (CT) is currently the most sensitive method to detect structural changes of the airways in children. 1, 4 Bronchiectasis on CT in children is diagnosed when the outer diameter of the airway is larger than the adjacent artery and/or when a lack of tapering can be observed. 5, 6, 7 Multiple image analysis systems have been developed to quantify structural lung changes in CT. Using these systems, bronchiectasis was validated as a clinically relevant CT related outcome measures in many studies. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 In addition, bronchiectasis in school‐age children is considered a clinically important outcome measure in CF lung disease. 2, 9, 13 It was shown that the extent of bronchiectasis is associated with more pulmonary exacerbations and lower quality of life in school‐aged children. 8, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17 Furthermore, it has been well established that spirometry parameters have poor sensitivity to detect and monitor bronchiectasis. 18, 19 In today's CF populations that have well‐preserved lung function, bronchiectasis still increases over time in school‐age children as well as in adults, which can occur even when forced expiratory volume 1 (FEV 1) does not show significant changes. 9, 19, 20 However, to date in preschool children, the usefulness of a bronchiectasis score as an outcome measure for CF lung disease is less clear. Even though bronchiectasis is present in 60% to 80% of the children with CF in the school‐age, 21 the extent and severity of bronchiectasis in preschool children are generally lower (29.3%‐61.5%) and therefore not considered a sensitive outcome measure for clinical studies and patient care in this age group. 4, 14, 22 However, diffuse airway abnormalities such as airway wall thickening, and mucus plugging are observed in many preschool children. 23 It is hypothesized that these preschool airway changes reflect diffuse airway disease that eventually will result in bronchiectasis in the school age.

### The risk factors involved in airway mucus plug in children with ADV pneumonia [^116nYf1u]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In summary, for children with ADV pneumonia and a fever course of ≥ 6.5 days, PCT ≥ 0.705 ng/ml, and LDH ≥ 478.5 U/L, it is necessary to be vigilant in case of the formation of airway mucus plugs. However, since this study is a single-center study with a small sample size and a retrospective study, it will have an impact on the statistical results and needs to be explored in depth by multi-center or further expansion of the number of cases. The mechanism of development of ADV bronchial mucus plugs is still unclear. It may be related to the inflammatory and immune responses induced by the ADV infection, but this needs to be further investigated. As airway mucus plug lacks clinical specificity on imaging, it may lead to adverse sequelae if not removed promptly. Therefore, physicians should stay alert regarding the possible development of this condition. For children with ADV pneumonia, who are suspected of developing airway mucus plugs, fibreoptic bronchoscopy and alveolar lavage should be actively performed, in addition to the initiation of the symptomatic and antibiotic/antiviral therapy. Prompt bronchoscopy as an adjuvant therapy to remove respiratory secretions helps in unblocking the airway, reducing long-term complications, and improving the children's prognosis.

### Luminal mucus plugs are spatially associated with airway wall thickening in severe COPD and asthma: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study [^116msv1p]. Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Airway wall thickening and excess airway mucus occur in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but few studies have investigated the relationship between them. Our objective was to determine the association between computed tomography (CT) airway wall thickening in segmental airways proximal to airways with or without mucus plugging in patients with asthma and COPD.

Methods

Mucus plugging was scored using a CT bronchopulmonary segment-based scoring system in asthma and COPD patients. For each of the 19 segmental airways, a mucus plug was defined as complete occlusion of one or more of the daughter branches (sub-segmental airways) by mucus. CT airway measurements were generated for each of the 19 segmental airways: wall-area-percentage (WA%), lumen area (LA), and total airway count (TAC) (VIDA Diagnostics Inc.). Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed for the presence of mucus plugs with corresponding CT measurement and adjusted by covariates; each of the 19 segments was treated as a nested variable.

Results

A total of 33 participants were evaluated. Participants had a mean age of 60 ± 15yrs and there were n = 14 (42%) males. There were 16 (48%) participants with a diagnosis of asthma and 17 (52%) with a COPD diagnosis. The mean FEV 1 was 53 ± 21%pred and FEV 1 /FVC was 54 ± 15%. The mean mucus score in all participants was 15 ± 4 (min = 0, max = 19). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed the presence of airway mucus was significantly associated with increased CT WA% (β = 7.30, p = 0.004) and reduced TAC (β = -0.06, p = 0.045).

Conclusions

There was increased airway wall thickness and reduced airway counts on CT in segments where there was a distal mucus plug compared to segments without mucus plugs in asthma and COPD.

### A comparison of serial computed tomography and functional change in bronchiectasis [^113iZU6C]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

In bronchiectasis the morphological determinants of (marginal) fluctuations in pulmonary function tests are uncertain. The aim of the present study was to evaluate serial computed tomography (CT) changes in relation to pulmonary function trends in patients with bronchiectasis. The relationships between pulmonary function indices and CT scans in 48 adult patients with bronchiectasis were evaluated at baseline and at follow-up, at a median interval of 28 months (range 6–74 months). Two independent observers semiquantitatively scored CT features of bronchial and small airways disease. At initial assessment, the severity of airflow obstruction was linked primarily to the extent of mosaic attenuation. However, serial changes in pulmonary function indices were only associated with serial changes in mucous plugging scores. Alterations in mucous plugging on serial CT were associated with changes in the severity of bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickness. Greater severity of all three morphological abnormalities at baseline CT were predictive of significant declines in forced expiratory volume in one second, with severe bronchial wall thickness being the most adverse prognostic determinant. Variations in mucous plugging on computed tomography correlate with minor fluctuations in pulmonary function tests in bronchiectasis. However, the severity of bronchial wall thickness is the primary determinant of subsequent major functional decline.

P076 An alternative diagnosis for vape induced lung injury — case report

L Veldhuis, J Van Oosten, H Endeman

Erasmus Medical Center, Intensive Care, Rotterdam, Netherlands

Critical Care 2025, 29(S1) :P076

Introduction: A 17-year-old woman, presented to the emergency department with respiratory distress after three days of vaping up to 600 inhalations a day. The evening prior to admission, the patient experienced three episodes of acute breathlessness accompanied by wheezing and coughing, preceded by 4–5 days of headache and cold symptoms.

Methods: Upon admission she exhibited severe dyspnea and tachypnea with a silent chest. Despite receiving mechanical ventilation and the treatment for a potential status asthmaticus her condition continued to deteriorate, requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Chest computed tomography revealed severe subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum as well as severe central and peripheral mucus plugs (Figure). After 17 days of ECMO support and 26 ventilation days she was transferred to the ward without supplemental oxygen.

Results: E-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury (EVALI) is a clinical diagnosis that requires the use of an e-cigarette in the 90 days preceding the appearance of initial symptoms: pulmonary infiltrates on a plain chest radiograph or chest CT, and the absence of any other possible etiology, such as infection [1]. In the absence of pulmonary infiltrates and ground-glass opacities, a diagnosis of EVALI could not be stated. Notably, there was a significant amount of epithelial shedding and numerous mucus plugs present. With the absence of pulmonary edema and no response on asthma treatments, a near fatal asthmatic attack was unlikely [2]. This patient suffered from inhalation injury caused by vaping chemicals and temperatures that can reach 1000 degrees Celsius [3]. This lead to mucus production and epithelial denudation leading to airway obstruction.

Conclusions: This case demonstrates that severe respiratory distress caused by excessive vaping is not always attributable to EVALI. Inhalation injury from vaping is a serious condition.

### Postmortem lung findings in a patient with asthma and coronavirus disease 2019 [^112xwsZa]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Asthma is increasingly recognized as an underlying risk factor for severe respiratory disease in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), particularly in the United States. Here, we report the postmortem lung findings from a 37-year-old man with asthma, who met the clinical criteria for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and died of COVID-19 less than 2 weeks after presentation to the hospital. His lungs showed mucus plugging and other histologic changes attributable to asthma, as well as early diffuse alveolar damage and a fibrinous pneumonia. The presence of diffuse alveolar damage is similar to descriptions of autopsy lung findings from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and the absence of a neutrophil-rich acute bronchopneumonia differs from the histologic changes typical of influenza. The relative contribution of mucus plugging to his hypoxemia is unknown.

### Computed tomography scanning techniques for the evaluation of cystic fibrosis lung disease [^111L68QY]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2007). Low credibility.

Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scanners allow diagnosis and monitoring of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease at substantially lower radiation doses than with prior scanners. Complete spiral chest CT scans are accomplished in less than 10 seconds and scanner advances now allow the acquisition of comprehensive volumetric datasets for three-dimensional reconstruction of the lungs and airways. There are two types of CT scanning protocols currently used to assess CF lung disease: (1) high-resolution CT (HRCT) imaging, in which thin 0.5–1.5-mm slices are obtained every 0.5, 1, or 2 cm from apex to base for inspiratory scans, and limited, spaced HRCT slices obtained for expiratory scans; and (2) complete spiral CT imaging covering the entire lung for inspiratory and expiratory scanning. These scanning protocols allow scoring of CF lung disease and provide CT datasets to quantify airway and air-trapping measurements. CF CT scoring systems typically assess bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening, mucus plugging, and atelectasis/consolidation from inspiratory scans, whereas air trapping is scored from expiratory imaging. Recently, CT algorithms have been developed for both HRCT and complete spiral CT imaging to quantify several airway indices, to determine the volume and density of the lung, and to assess regional and global air trapping. CT scans are currently acquired by either controlled-volume scanning techniques (controlled-ventilation infant CT scanning or spirometer-controlled CT scanning in children and adults) or by voluntary breath holds at full inflation and deflation.

The pulmonary abnormalities associated with cystic fibrosis have different appearances depending on the modality chosen to evaluate them (Fig. 1), and certain abnormalities can only be evaluated with CT or MRI, since CT has a higher contrast resolution than radiography and tomosynthesis and MRI is performed with intravenous contrast, enabling detection of perfusion defects (Table 1).

Fig. 1
A 15-year-old girl with cystic fibrosis examined with the four different imaging modalities within 4 months. A frontal radiograph (a) acquired on the same occasion as the tomosynthesis examination (b). CT (c) performed four months earlier and MRI (d) performed 2 weeks earlier (T1-weighted sequence, with intravenous contrast). Tomosynthesis, CT and MRI sections were selected to represent approximately the same imaging plane, to simplify the comparison between the modalities. Overinflation, bronchial wall thickening, bronchiectasis and mucus plugging were present in both lungs, with the most severe changes in the right upper lobe

A comparison of the four different radiological modalities regarding the ability to depict cystic fibrosis changes of the lungs (yes or no), as well as for cost; need for anaesthesia in young children; detail of information provided by the imaging modality; simplicity of the examination procedure; and radiation dose. The approximate cost for each modality (derived from the price list of Skåne Regional Council, Sweden) was compared with the cost of a frontal and lateral radiograph, which was given the factor 1

### Foreign-body aspiration, asthma and chronic bronchitis… [^113J5G2Q]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Over the subsequent three weeks, despite moderate- to high-dose steroids, frequent bronchodilator treatments and antibiotics, the patient's condition deteriorated to the point that she required admission to the intensive care unit. On admission, a computed tomographic scan of the chest was obtained to search for another etiology of her exacerbated respiratory distress. CT results revealed a soft tissue density in the right lower lobe bronchus. On subsequent fiberoptic bronchoscopy, a mucoid impaction was identified in the right lower lobe bronchus with surrounding erythema and edema. On removal of the plug, the patient's acute and subacute symptoms subsided immediately. The pathology specimen. consisted of green, soft, amorphous material embedded in mucin, measuring 1. 5 ×
0. 5 × 0. 3 cm in aggregate.

The histologic examination revealed strips of plant tissue with prominent thick cell walls that were admixed with bacterial colonies, inflammatory debris, mucin and respiratory epithelial cells. The diagnosis of foreign-body aspiration with secondary mucoid impaction in healthy adults is subtle. Here, despite the localized unilateral position of the impaction, no roentgenographic signs such as volume loss or opacities were evident, and the clinical findings were bilateral. Foreign-body aspiration is commonly considered in children who have persistent or recurrent wheezing and pulmonary infection. This diagnosis is challenging because the presentation and the subsequent course are often atypical. Patients present with nonspecific symptoms such as wheezing, cough with sputum 3 and a normal chest film. As few as 6 to 8 percent of foreign-body aspirations are reported to result in abnormal chest films.

6 Furthermore, one study 1 reported that symptoms of foreign-body aspiration often respond, at least partially, to standard asthma therapy: seven out of 10 patients obtained relief in the uninvolved lung, while two out of 10 patients obtained relief in both lungs following standard asthma therapy. The initial event of this patient's illness was inhalation of plant material that lodged in the right lower lobe bronchus. With time, local inflammation and bronchial secretions resulted in the foreign body becoming adherent and coated with mucus, which desiccated in situ. This inflammatory process continued, and the patient remained symptomatic until the impaction was diagnosed and the foreign-body was removed. This case illustrates that foreign-body aspiration must be considered as one of several possible etiologies in patients presenting with respiratory distress.
