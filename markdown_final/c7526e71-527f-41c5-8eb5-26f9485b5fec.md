## Question

can phentermine and topomax be taken together?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether phentermine and topiramate can be taken together, and if so, what the rationale, indications, dosing, efficacy, safety, monitoring, and comparative considerations are for the fixed-dose combination and for concomitant use in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether an FDA-approved fixed-dose combination exists and what strengths are available. Then, I should verify the labeled indications and appropriate patient selection. Next, I will review efficacy data from pivotal trials and meta-analyses. After that, I need to evaluate safety, contraindications, and REMS requirements. Finally, I will outline dosing and discontinuation rules, monitoring, and contextualize the role of this therapy relative to other anti-obesity options.

> Let me first confirm whether a fixed-dose combination product exists, because if it does, that directly answers the "can they be taken together" question. Qsymia is an FDA-approved, once-daily, extended-release capsule that combines immediate-release phentermine with extended-release topiramate and is available in four strengths: 3.75/23 mg, 7.5/46 mg, 11.25/69 mg, and 15/92 mg of phentermine/topiramate, respectively, which confirms that co-administration is an approved strategy within a single capsule formulation [^111E7p3o] [^111rW4Ly].

> Hold on, I should verify the clinical rationale for combining these two agents rather than simply using one at higher doses. Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine that suppresses appetite via hypothalamic norepinephrine pathways, while topiramate is a sulfamate-substituted monosaccharide with multiple neuropharmacologic actions thought to reduce intake and alter energy balance; the rationale is that lower doses of each, in combination, enhance weight loss while mitigating dose-limiting adverse effects seen with higher-dose monotherapies, which is borne out by dose-ranging and combination studies as well as mechanistic reviews [^113AstCf] [^115JymE8] [^111qbSDP] [^111jEQ5t].

> I need to ensure I'm precise about indications and patient selection, because that dictates who should receive therapy. The fixed-dose phentermine/topiramate ER is indicated for chronic weight management in adults with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² with at least one weight-related comorbidity as an adjunct to reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, with adult usage supported by regulatory labeling and contemporary clinical guidance, including international experience and phase 4 data in diverse populations [^111E7p3o] [^113Tukfe] [^117M2mN2] [^1154jydD]. But wait, what about adolescents? Randomized trials in adolescents have demonstrated BMI reductions with both mid and top doses, yet use in this population remains investigational in many jurisdictions and is not reflected in US labeling, so pediatric use requires careful off-label consideration and specialist oversight if pursued [^115Ypygk] [^115rJPNx].

> Next, I should review efficacy from pivotal trials and meta-analyses to quantify expected benefits. In CONQUER and EQUIP, 56-week treatment with phentermine/topiramate produced dose-dependent weight loss of approximately 7.8–9.8% and 10.9% at higher doses versus 1–2% with placebo, with favorable effects on lipids, glucose, and blood pressure, and larger proportions achieving at least 5% weight loss compared with placebo, which is clinically meaningful for cardiometabolic risk reduction [^111rW4Ly] [^111VyggR]. Let me double-check pooled evidence: systematic reviews and meta-analyses confirm roughly 7–8 kg greater weight loss than placebo at 56–108 weeks, with clear dose-response across labeled strengths, reinforcing reproducibility across trials and durations [^115TzELB] [^111bnF7A]. I should also note disease-specific benefits: subanalyses and related work show substantial risk reduction for incident type 2 diabetes proportional to weight loss and improvements in obstructive sleep apnea metrics at the top dose, suggesting potential ancillary benefits beyond weight loss alone [^114gVao5] [^115Hn6rR].

> I will now examine safety and tolerability, starting with common adverse effects, and I need to be cautious to separate dose-related from idiosyncratic events. The most frequent adverse reactions are paresthesia, dry mouth, constipation, dysgeusia, insomnia, and dizziness, each with clear dose dependence, and cognitive complaints such as difficulties with attention, memory, or word-finding are described in labeling and independent reviews, which often guide dose selection and titration pace to improve tolerability [^111ZrhSU] [^115TzELB] [^115GH7Qh]. Wait, let me verify postmarketing signals as well; post-approval reports for the fixed-dose product include psychiatric events like suicidal ideation and ophthalmic issues such as acute angle-closure glaucoma, which, although rare, demand screening and prompt evaluation if symptoms arise [^113Qc1jr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before addressing serious risks that change how we prescribe and monitor. Teratogenicity due to the topiramate component elevates the risk of oral clefts with first-trimester exposure, making the product contraindicated in pregnancy and necessitating a REMS with monthly pregnancy testing and effective contraception for those who can become pregnant, which is non-negotiable in routine practice [^111E7p3o] [^111CbAri]. I should also confirm neuropsychiatric risk: as with other antiepileptic drugs, topiramate is associated with approximately a twofold increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior compared with placebo, prompting baseline and periodic mood screening and a low threshold to discontinue for new or worsening depression or suicidality [^115axFi7]. Furthermore, the topiramate-related carbonic anhydrase inhibition may reduce serum bicarbonate, so monitoring for metabolic acidosis is prudent, while the phentermine component can increase heart rate by a small mean amount, necessitating vital sign monitoring and individualized cardiovascular risk assessment at baseline and during therapy, particularly in those with existing cardiovascular disease risk [^115GH7Qh] [^113AstCf].

> I should double-check cardiovascular outcomes and event data, since prescribers often ask about MACE. Clinical trial safety cohorts and observational analyses have not shown an increase in major adverse cardiovascular events with phentermine/topiramate compared with placebo, though the number of events is small and confidence intervals are wide, and a dedicated outcomes program has been emphasized to address residual uncertainty, so clinicians should apply caution in higher-risk patients while recognizing the concurrent improvements in blood pressure and cardiometabolic markers with weight loss [^113TYutF] [^1114fqFK] [^116RXxwq].

> Let me consider contraindications and important cautions to avoid preventable harm. In addition to pregnancy, contraindications include glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, and recent monoamine oxidase inhibitor use, with caution advised for combining with other weight-loss drugs, which is generally discouraged in labeling for phentermine and for the fixed-dose combination due to additive safety concerns and limited evidence, even though exploratory trials with lorcaserin plus phentermine showed short-term efficacy without clear serotonergic signal increases but higher discontinuation at BID phentermine dosing [^112dAy8U] [^113Tukfe] [^115qnJpR]. But wait, I need to remember phentermine's label warnings about primary pulmonary hypertension and valvular disease signals historically associated with serotonergic co-therapies; while these were not attributable to phentermine alone mechanistically, prudence dictates cardiovascular screening and avoidance of serotonergic combinations outside trials [^112dAy8U] [^114oF6CT].

> Next, I should review the REMS and ongoing monitoring requirements, because adherence to these is essential for safe prescribing. The REMS mandates certified prescribers and pharmacies, baseline and monthly pregnancy testing for individuals who can become pregnant, and counseling on highly effective contraception during therapy and for at least one month after the last dose, alongside routine assessments of weight, heart rate, blood pressure, mood and suicidality, cognitive symptoms, and serum bicarbonate or electrolytes as clinically indicated, especially with dose escalation or symptoms suggestive of acidosis or ocular events [^111E7p3o] [^113Tukfe] [^115axFi7].

> I need to check dosing, titration, and stopping rules to ensure I'm aligned with the label and best practice. Therapy typically starts with a 3.75/23 mg titration dose for two weeks, followed by 7.5/46 mg as the initial maintenance dose, with reassessment at 12 weeks; if weight loss is less than 3% at 7.5/46 mg, escalation to 15/92 mg can be considered, and if weight loss remains less than 5% after 12 weeks at 15/92 mg, discontinuation is recommended, with tapering at the highest dose to mitigate topiramate-associated seizure risk and phentermine withdrawal symptoms, which operationalizes a responder strategy to balance efficacy and safety [^113Tukfe] [^111aC35Q].

> But wait, what about misuse, dependence, and abrupt discontinuation risks with the phentermine component. Given Schedule IV status and known stimulant misuse potential, prescribers should assess abuse risk, limit to indicated patients, and taper from the 15/92 mg dose rather than stopping abruptly to avoid fatigue or depression from phentermine and seizure risk from topiramate, aligning with controlled-substance stewardship principles in obesity pharmacotherapy [^111aC35Q].

> I will now examine special populations and comorbid conditions where benefits or risks may differ. In obstructive sleep apnea, top-dose phentermine/topiramate improved apnea-hypopnea index beyond placebo over 28 weeks, likely mediated by weight loss, suggesting an adjunctive role when continuous positive airway pressure is insufficient or in parallel with lifestyle therapy, though larger confirmatory studies are warranted [^115Hn6rR]. In post–Roux-en-Y gastric bypass weight regain, retrospective analyses suggest phentermine and topiramate, alone or in combination, may attenuate regain, but standardized prospective protocols are lacking, so careful case-by-case use is reasonable with close follow-up [^116riexf]. Regarding eating disorders, small randomized data suggest reductions in binge-eating frequency and weight with the combination, yet case series describe topiramate-associated emergence or worsening of eating disorder symptoms in adolescents, so screening and vigilant monitoring for disordered eating are important, particularly in younger patients or those with migraine managed with topiramate [^116Kaerx] [^112Dogiq].

> Let me reconsider where this therapy fits relative to alternatives, because comparative effectiveness and outcomes matter. Compared with several oral anti-obesity agents historically available, phentermine/topiramate generally yields larger mean weight loss at approved doses, but it lacks definitive cardiovascular outcome benefit data to date, whereas some injectable GLP-1 receptor agonists achieve ≥ 10% weight loss and have established cardiovascular risk reduction in diabetes populations, so therapy choice should integrate efficacy goals, comorbidities, route preferences, and safety profiles, acknowledging that short-term OSA and metabolic data for phentermine/topiramate are favorable but long-term cardiovascular outcomes remain under evaluation [^115GH7Qh] [^111vwzPo] [^115Hn6rR].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought both components were limited to short-term use, but I should correct that to avoid confusion. Phentermine as monotherapy is labeled for short-term use, whereas the fixed-dose phentermine/topiramate ER product is approved for chronic weight management with defined response thresholds and a REMS program, so I should be explicit that the combination, not phentermine alone, carries the long-term indication in adults who meet criteria [^112dAy8U] [^113Tukfe] [^111E7p3o].

> One more point I should confirm is practical counseling to minimize preventable adverse events. Patients should take the medication in the morning to reduce insomnia risk, avoid abrupt discontinuation at higher doses, recognize and promptly report mood changes, visual symptoms, or signs of metabolic acidosis, and for those who can become pregnant, adhere to monthly testing and reliable contraception throughout therapy and for at least one month after the last dose, which operationalizes the REMS into everyday care and improves safety [^113Tukfe] [^111E7p3o] [^115axFi7].

> The PHEN/TPM combination offers a dose-dependent, oral option with the highest mean. Wait, I left that thought incomplete — let me clarify precisely. The PHEN/TPM combination offers a dose-dependent, oral option with among the highest mean weight loss observed for oral anti-obesity therapies in randomized trials, balanced against well-characterized teratogenic, neuropsychiatric, and hemodynamic risks that can be mitigated through REMS adherence, careful selection, and structured monitoring to maximize net clinical benefit in appropriately selected adults with obesity or overweight and comorbidities [^115TzELB] [^111rW4Ly] [^113Tukfe].

Yes — phentermine and topiramate are co-formulated as Qsymia for chronic weight management in adults with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² with comorbidities [^111E7p3o]. The combination is **FDA-approved** and achieves greater weight loss than either drug alone, with dose-dependent efficacy [^111rW4Ly] [^115TzELB]. Common adverse effects include paresthesia, dry mouth, constipation, insomnia, and anxiety; serious risks include teratogenicity, cardiovascular events, and psychiatric effects [^115TzELB] [^115axFi7]. The combination is **contraindicated in pregnancy**, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, recent MAOI use, and uncontrolled hypertension. Monitor weight, blood pressure, heart rate, mood, and cognition, and **taper gradually to avoid seizures**.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting combination therapy

- **FDA approval**: The combination is approved for chronic weight management in adults with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² with at least one weight-related comorbidity (e.g. hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia).

- **Efficacy**: Clinical trials show greater weight loss with the combination than with either drug alone, with dose-dependent effects [^111rW4Ly] [^111HMxov].

- **Long-term benefits**: Sustained weight loss and improved metabolic parameters (e.g. glucose, lipids, blood pressure) have been demonstrated in long-term studies [^114gVao5] [^111RkQcK].

---

Administration is **once daily in the morning** to reduce insomnia risk; **taper** gradually to avoid seizures, especially at higher doses [^113Tukfe] [^111aC35Q].

---

## Potential benefits of combination therapy

The combination provides **greater weight loss** than monotherapy, with dose-dependent effects [^115TzELB] [^111HMxov], and improves glucose control, lipid profiles, and blood pressure [^111rW4Ly] [^111VyggR]. It also reduces progression to type 2 diabetes in high-risk patients [^114gVao5] [^111RkQcK].

---

## Potential risks and side effects

- **Common side effects**: Paresthesia, dry mouth, constipation, insomnia, anxiety, dizziness, dysgeusia, and cognitive impairment [^111ZrhSU] [^115TzELB].

- **Serious risks**: Teratogenicity (oral clefts), cardiovascular events (hypertension, tachycardia), psychiatric effects (depression, suicidal ideation), and metabolic acidosis [^116FY9Gv] [^116RXxwq].

- **Abuse potential**: Phentermine is a Schedule IV controlled substance with abuse and dependence risk [^111aC35Q].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **pregnancy**, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, recent MAOI use, uncontrolled hypertension, and known hypersensitivity to components; **precautions** include use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, psychiatric disorders, renal or hepatic impairment, or risk factors for metabolic acidosis.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Weight and BMI**: Regularly monitor weight and BMI to assess efficacy.

- **Cardiovascular monitoring**: Monitor blood pressure and heart rate due to cardiovascular risks [^116RXxwq].

- **Psychiatric and cognitive monitoring**: Monitor for mood changes, depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment [^115axFi7].

- **Laboratory monitoring**: Periodic metabolic panels, electrolytes, and renal function tests.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Follow FDA-approved dosing, titration, and monitoring protocols [^113Tukfe]. Use the combination as an adjunct to lifestyle modification in adults with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² with comorbidities; **discontinue if ≥ 5% weight loss is not achieved** after 12 weeks at the maximum dose.

### Qsymia [^111E7p3o]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Qsymia extended-release capsules are comprised of immediate-release phentermine hydrochloride (expressed as the weight of the free base) and extended-release topiramate. Qsymia contains phentermine hydrochloride, a sympathomimetic amine anorectic, and topiramate, a sulfamate-substituted monosaccharide.

- **Phentermine hydrochloride**: The chemical name of phentermine hydrochloride is α,α-dimethylphenethylamine hydrochloride. The molecular formula is C10H15N ∙ HCl, and its molecular weight is 185.7 (hydrochloride salt) or 149.2 (free base). Phentermine hydrochloride is a white, odorless, hygroscopic, crystalline powder that is soluble in water, methanol, and ethanol.

- **Topiramate**: Topiramate is 2,3:4,5-di-O-isopropylidene-β-D-fructopyranose sulfamate. The molecular formula is C12H21NO8S and its molecular weight is 339.4. Topiramate is a white to off-white crystalline powder with a bitter taste. It is freely soluble in methanol and acetone, sparingly soluble in pH 9 to pH 12 aqueous solutions, and slightly soluble in pH 1 to pH 8 aqueous solutions.

Qsymia (phentermine and topiramate extended-release capsules) is for oral administration and available in four dosage strengths:

- 3.75 mg/23 mg (phentermine 3.75 mg and topiramate 23 mg), equivalent to 4.67 mg of phentermine hydrochloride USP.

- 7.5 mg/46 mg (phentermine 7.5 mg and topiramate 46 mg), equivalent to 9.33 mg of phentermine hydrochloride USP.

- 11.25 mg/69 mg (phentermine 11.25 mg and topiramate 69 mg), equivalent to 14.0 mg of phentermine hydrochloride USP.

### Qsymia [^1177qita]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Nonclinical toxicology**:
	- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility**:

		**Phentermine/Topiramate**

		No animal studies have been conducted with the combination of phentermine/topiramate to evaluate carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility. The following data are based on findings in studies performed individually with phentermine or topiramate, Qsymia's two active ingredients.

		**Phentermine**

		Phentermine was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a chromosomal aberration test in Chinese hamster lung (CHL-K1) cells, or an in vivo micronucleus assay. Rats were administered oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day phentermine for 2 years. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity at the highest dose of phentermine (30 mg/kg), which is approximately 11 to 15 times the maximum recommended clinical dose of Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg based on AUC exposure. No animal studies have been conducted with phentermine to determine the potential for impairment of fertility.

		**Topiramate**

		Topiramate did not demonstrate genotoxic potential when tested in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays. Topiramate was not mutagenic in the Ames test or the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay; it did not increase unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes in vitro; and it did not increase chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes in vitro or in rat bone marrow in vivo. An increase in urinary bladder tumors was observed in mice given topiramate (20, 75, and 300 mg/kg) in the diet for 21 months.

### Pharmacotherapy of obesity: An update on the available medications and drugs under investigation [^115Hn6rR]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

We identified three studies evaluating the effect of FDA-approved anti-obesity medications (AOM) on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): one trial on each of phentermine/topiramate, liraglutide, and a pooled analysis of five trials on naltrexone/bupropion.

- **Phentermine/topiramate (Qsymia)**: In one trial, participants with obesity and moderate OSA were randomized to receive the combination treatment of phentermine/topiramate (15/92) (n = 22) or placebo (n = 23) with standardized advice on lifestyle modification for a duration of 28 weeks. The primary outcome was the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) with a score of 5–14 events per hour considered mild, 15–29 moderate, and 30 or more considered severe. The reduction in apnea-hypopnea events was more favorable in patients taking phentermine/topiramate compared to placebo, with a reduction of 31.5 (19.9) events per hour in the intervention group and 16.6 (19.9) events per hour in the placebo group (p = 0.0084).

- **Naltrexone/bupropion (Contrave/Mysimba)**: A pooled analysis of five RCTs on naltrexone/bupropion (n = 2545) compared to placebo (n = 1515) assessed the prevalence of OSA at 24–56 weeks and showed no significant difference between groups.

- **Liraglutide (Saxenda)**: The change in AHI was studied in one trial on patients with moderate to severe OSA (AHI of 15–29 or 30 or more events per hour) taking liraglutide 3.0 mg (n = 180) or placebo (n = 179). After 32 weeks of treatment, there was a significant reduction in AHI in the liraglutide group, with a drop of 12.2 (1.8) events per hour compared to placebo, which had a drop of 6.1 (2.0) events per hour (p = 0.015).

### Prevention of type 2 diabetes in subjects with prediabetes and metabolic syndrome treated with phentermine and topiramate extended release [^114gVao5]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To evaluate, over 108 weeks, the effect of phentermine and topiramate extended release (PHEN/TPM ER) treatment on progression to type 2 diabetes and/or cardiometabolic disease in subjects with prediabetes and/or metabolic syndrome (MetS) at baseline.

- **Research design and methods**: This subanalysis was conducted within a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of overweight/obese subjects (BMI ≥ 27 to ≤ 45 kg/m²) with two or more comorbidities. Subjects were randomized to receive either placebo, PHEN 7.5 mg/TPM ER 46 mg (7.5/46), or PHEN 15 mg/TPM ER 92 mg (15/92), along with lifestyle modifications, for 108 weeks. The study evaluated percent weight loss in the intent-to-treat population using multiple imputation (ITT-MI), the annualized incidence rate of progression to type 2 diabetes, and changes in glycemia, lipid parameters, blood pressure, and waist circumference.

- **Results**: At baseline, 475 subjects met the criteria for prediabetes and/or MetS. After 108 weeks, those in the placebo, 7.5/46, and 15/92 groups experienced mean percent weight losses of 2.5%, 10.9%, and 12.1%, respectively (ITT-MI; P < 0.0001 vs. placebo). This weight loss was associated with reductions of 70.5% and 78.7% in the annualized incidence rate of type 2 diabetes for those receiving 7.5/46 and 15/92, respectively (ITT; P < 0.05), compared to placebo. The prevention of diabetes through PHEN/TPM ER was linked to the degree of weight loss and was accompanied by significant improvements in cardiometabolic parameters. PHEN/TPM ER was well tolerated over the 2-year period by this subgroup.

- **Conclusions**: PHEN/TPM ER plus lifestyle modification significantly reduced the progression to type 2 diabetes and improved cardiometabolic parameters over 108 weeks for subjects with prediabetes and/or MetS.

### Current and emerging medications for overweight or obesity in people with comorbidities [^113Tukfe]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

There are four separate doses available for phentermine/topiramate ER combination therapy, but only two are recommended for long-term treatment: 7.5 mg phentermine/46 mg topiramate ER once daily and 15 mg/92 mg once daily. The remaining two doses, 3.75 mg/23 mg and 11.25 mg/69 mg once daily, are titration doses. When prescribing this drug, a 2-week course of 3.75 mg/23 mg is recommended before the recipient is placed on a 'mid-range' maintenance dose of 7.5 mg/46 mg. It is recommended that the drug is either discontinued or escalated when individuals have not lost 3% of their body weight after 3 months on 7.5 mg/46 mg.

At the mid-dose of 7.5 mg/46 mg, the medication can simply be stopped without titration. At the maximum dose of 15 mg/92 mg, drug discontinuation should be tapered by taking a dose every other day for at least one week before stopping treatment in those who have not lost 5% body weight with the maximum dose. The concept of identifying responders and non-responders and acting accordingly is relatively new in the obesity field. Phentermine/topiramate ER was the first obesity medication for which the FDA incorporated non-responder recommendations into the package insert. The Endocrine Society guidelines also recommend considering alternative weight loss treatments for non-responders or in cases of safety or tolerability issues.

### Qsymia [^111CbAri]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Phentermine/topiramate embryo-fetal development studies have been conducted in rats and rabbits with combination phentermine and topiramate treatment. Phentermine and topiramate co-administered to rats during the period of organogenesis (gestation day (GD) 6 through 17) caused reduced fetal body weights but did not cause fetal malformations at the maximum dose of 3.75 mg/kg phentermine and 25 mg/kg topiramate [approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on area under the curve (AUC) estimates for each active ingredient]. In a similar study in rabbits in which the same doses were administered from GD 6 through 18, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed at approximately 0.1 times (phentermine) and 1 time (topiramate) clinical exposures at the MRHD based on AUC. Significantly lower maternal body weight gain was recorded at these doses in rats and rabbits.

A pre- and post-natal development study was conducted in rats with combination phentermine and topiramate treatment. There were no adverse maternal or offspring effects in rats treated throughout organogenesis and lactation with 1.5 mg/kg/day phentermine and 10 mg/kg/day topiramate (approximately 2- and 3-times clinical exposures at the MRHD, respectively, based on AUC). Treatment with higher doses of 11.25 mg/kg/day phentermine and 75 mg/kg/day topiramate (approximately 5 and 6 times maximum clinical doses based on AUC, respectively) caused reduced maternal body weight gain and offspring toxicity. Offspring effects included lower pup survival after birth and increased limb and tail malformations.

### Current and emerging medications for overweight or obesity in people with comorbidities [^116FY9Gv]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Along with guidelines on how to titrate and when to stop using phentermine/topiramate ER, the FDA also imposes a Risk Evaluation Management Strategy program intended to help ensure that the medication is used properly. This is because of the teratogenic risk associated with topiramate: fetuses exposed to topiramate in the first trimester have an increased risk of oral clefts (cleft lip with or without cleft palate). Phentermine/topiramate ER is contraindicated in pregnancy (category X) and is only available through certified pharmacies, which ensure recipients are aware of the risk and take appropriate precautions.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has raised concerns regarding the long-term safety of phentermine/topiramate ER because of potential adverse cardiovascular, psychiatric, cognitive, and teratogenic effects.

- **Lorcaserin**: In 2012, lorcaserin (brand name Belviq®), a 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin; 5-HT) 2C receptor agonist, was also approved for weight management in the United States. Lorcaserin is used at a dose of 10 mg twice daily and taken independently of meals. In contrast to phentermine/topiramate ER, no dose titration of lorcaserin is required, and no Risk Evaluation Management Strategy program is in place for this medication. There is a recommended time point in clinical management to discontinue the medication if it has not been effective for an individual. If the recipient has not lost ≥ 5% of their weight 3 months after having initiated lorcaserin, they are considered a non-responder and the medication should be stopped, as it is unlikely they will benefit from continued use.

### Controlled-release phentermine/topiramate in severely obese adults: A randomized controlled trial (EQUIP) [^116sPAse]. Obesity (2012). Low credibility.

Three main analyses were performed for the percent weight loss (WL) as a dependent variable. These analyses are outlined in detail, alongside additional sensitivity analyses, in Supplementary Appendixes 1–3 online.

- **Analysis A**: This was the primary analysis pre-specified in the study protocol as an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis following FDA standards. It included data from patients who discontinued the drug but continued with data assessments through the study completion.

- **Analysis B**: This was a pre-specified secondary per protocol-based analysis to assess the experience in patients who completed the full intended treatment course with the study drug or placebo. It included only those patients with available end-point data and who reported taking their medication within 7 days before the final measurement. The analysis used the analysis of covariance model described previously.

- **Analysis C**: Defined by Lachin as an ITT analysis, it included all randomized patients. Multiple imputation was employed to address missing data, as detailed by Elobeid et al.

For analyses with percent weight change as a dichotomous outcome, the above three analyses were used, but the analysis of covariance was replaced by logistic regression with the same covariates.

### Qsymia [^115axFi7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

**Suicidal behavior and ideation**: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including topiramate, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical studies (monotherapy and adjunctive therapy, median treatment duration 12 weeks) of 11 different AEDs across several indications showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted relative risk 1.8, 95% CI 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. The estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in AED-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about the AED effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that…

### Controlled-release phentermine/topiramate in severely obese adults: A randomized controlled trial (EQUIP) [^111HMxov]. Obesity (2012). Low credibility.

Controlled-release phentermine/topiramate (PHEN/TPM CR) is an investigational weight loss therapy combining immediate-release phentermine and controlled-release topiramate, administered as a single daily morning dose. The highest dosage of PHEN/TPM CR includes phentermine 15 mg (expressed as free-base) and topiramate 92 mg. This combination therapy contains lower doses of these components compared to those currently marketed or studied for monotherapy in obesity. Each component has published data regarding dose-related efficacy, tolerability, and adverse events. The efficacy of the combination in weight loss exceeds the maximal response achieved with either individual agent alone at equivalent doses, potentially because each component targets multiple mechanisms influencing energy balance. The development goal of this combination therapy was to identify the dosage of each agent that maximized weight loss efficacy while minimizing tolerability concerns.

### Modern pharmacological treatment of obese patients [^113jKvyv]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Antiobesity drugs approved by the FDA include the selective serotonin receptor agonist Lorcaserin (tradename Belviq®) and the combination drug Phentermine/Topiramate (tradename Qsymia®), which are approved for the treatment of obesity in the United States.

- **Lorcaserin**: This drug reduces appetite by binding to the 5-HT2C receptors, for which it has a 15- to 100-fold greater selectivity over 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors. Its efficacy and safety were demonstrated in the BLOSSOM and BLOOM trials, where patients treated with Lorcaserin lost significantly more body weight compared with placebo (−5.8% versus −2.5%). Commonly reported side effects included headache, upper respiratory tract infections, and nasopharyngitis. Importantly, cardiac valvulopathy rates were similar to those of the placebo group. Significant improvements in lipid and glycemic indicators, quality-of-life measures, and vital signs were observed in the Lorcaserin group compared with placebo.

- **Phentermine/Topiramate (Qsymia®)**: Phentermine belongs to the class of amphetamine-type drugs and facilitates weight loss by activating the sympathetic nervous system, thereby increasing resting energy expenditure and decreasing food intake. Phentermine is contraindicated in patients with cardiac comorbidities, hyperthyroidism, and glaucoma, and in those who have taken monoamine oxidase inhibitors within 14 days. The second drug in Qsymia®, topiramate, is approved for the treatment of epilepsy and migraine prophylaxis. The weight-reducing side effects appear to be triggered by induced taste aversion, thus decreasing caloric intake.

### Cardiovascular safety during and after use of phentermine and topiramate [^116RXxwq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

The present retrospective cohort study was conducted in the Truven Health MarketScan Databases (Commercial and Medicare Supplemental administrative claims). MarketScan was chosen as the data source because it had the largest number of fixed-PHEN/TPM users among the databases evaluated during an earlier feasibility assessment. In addition, it has a suitable breadth of information available about patients and the ability to capture the medication exposures and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes reliably. A prospective study with the number of patients available in the present database would not be feasible because of the large study size and long duration required for CV outcome studies.

The data span the period beginning 1 July 2012, the month Qsymia was approved by the US FDA, through 30 September 2015. Patients were eligible for study entry if they were aged ≥ 18 years, had been enrolled in MarketScan for ≥ 6 months, and met the criteria to be included as a current or former user of PHEN, TPM, PHEN/TPM, and/or fixed-PHEN/TPM. Depending on their medication use, patients could simultaneously contribute time to more than one of these variously defined current-use medication cohorts. For example, patients prescribed fixed-PHEN/TPM contributed to the current-use fixed-PHEN/TPM, PHEN, TPM, and PHEN/TPM medication cohorts simultaneously.

### Current and emerging medications for overweight or obesity in people with comorbidities [^111ZrhSU]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

In people with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² (EQUIP trial), phentermine/topiramate ER was associated with significant improvements in waist circumference, blood pressure, lipid profiles, and fasting serum glucose compared with placebo. Similar improvements accompanied weight loss with phentermine/topiramate ER in the CONQUER trial. In the SEQUEL study, the decreases in blood pressure of 3–5 mmHg did not significantly differ across arms. However, phentermine/topiramate ER reduced concomitant antihypertensive and lipid‐lowering medication use. Phentermine/topiramate ER also impeded progression to T2D over 108 weeks (up to 76% in those without diabetes and 79% in those with prediabetes and/or metabolic syndrome at baseline, respectively, with the maximum dose of 15 mg/92 mg once daily) compared with placebo. In another study of obese adults with severe sleep apnea, phentermine/topiramate ER 15 mg/92 mg produced greater weight loss and improvements in apnea‐hypopnea index and sleep apnea symptoms than placebo.

The most common adverse reactions associated with phentermine/topiramate ER are:

- **Paresthesia**: 19.9% with phentermine/topiramate ER 15 mg/92 mg, 13.7% with 7.5 mg/46 mg, 4.2% with 3.75 mg/23 mg vs 1.9% with placebo over 1 year.
- **Dry mouth**: 19.1%, 13.5%, 6.7% vs 2.8%, respectively.
- **Constipation**: 16.1%, 15.1%, 7.9% vs 6.1%, respectively.
- **Dysgeusia**: 9.4%, 7.4%, 1.3% vs 1.1%, respectively.
- **Insomnia**: 9.4%, 5.8%, 5.0% vs 4.7%, respectively.
- **Dizziness**: 8.6%, 7.2%, 2.9% vs 3.4%, respectively.

The occurrence of these events, along with a number of others, is documented.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial of phentermine-topiramate ER in patients with binge-eating disorder and bulimia nervosa [^116Kaerx]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2020). High credibility.

Open trials suggest that phentermine/topiramate ER (PHEN/TPM-ER), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for obesity, has utility for binge eating. With no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) yet performed, this trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PHEN/TPM-ER in a crossover RCT for patients with binge-eating disorder (BED) or bulimia nervosa (BN).

Participants were randomized to 12 weeks of PHEN/TPM-ER (3.75 mg/23 mg-15 mg/92 mg) or placebo, followed by a 2-week drug washout, and then a 12-week crossover. Demographics, vitals, eating disorder behaviors, mood, and side effects were measured. The primary outcome was objective binge-eating (OBE) days over 4 weeks; secondary outcomes included binge abstinence. Mixed-effect models estimated treatment effects, with fixed effects adjusting for treatment, study period, and diagnosis.

The 22 adults (BED = 18, BN = 4) were female (96%), Caucasian (55%), with an average age of 42.9 years (SD = 10.1) and body mass index of 31.1 kg/m² (SD = 6.2). Baseline OBE days over 4 weeks decreased from 16.2 (SD = 7.8) to 4.2 (SD = 8.4) after PHEN/TPM-ER, compared to 13.2 (SD = 9.1) after placebo (p < 0.0001), with abstinence rates of 63.6% on PHEN/TPM-ER versus 9.1% on placebo (p < 0.0001). Weight changes were -5.8 kg on PHEN/TPM-ER versus +0.4 kg on placebo. The dropout rate was 2 (9%) on PHEN/TPM-ER and 2 (9%) on placebo, with few side effects noted. Vital sign changes with PHEN/TPM-ER were minimal and similar to those on placebo. Responses were not significantly different for BED versus BN.

This first RCT to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PHEN/TPM-ER for BED/BN found this new intervention to be effective and well-tolerated.

### Cardiovascular safety during and after use of phentermine and topiramate [^111VLq3F]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Nearly 40% of adults in the United States are obese, with the prevalence even greater among older adults, increasing over the past 15 years. Obese individuals present higher mortality rates than the general population, with an increased risk of overall, cardiovascular (CV)-related, and diabetes-related mortality. Recently, several medications have received the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval as adjuncts to diet and lifestyle modifications for obesity management. One such medication is a fixed-dose combination of phentermine and extended-release topiramate (Qsymia®, Vivus, Inc.).

Phentermine (PHEN) is a stimulant indicated for short-term weight management, acting as an appetite suppressant via the central nervous system. Topiramate (TPM) is an anticonvulsant indicated for the treatment of migraines and epilepsy, known to decrease appetite; thus, it is sometimes prescribed off-label for weight loss. Typical dosing of PHEN is 15 to 37.5 mg/d, while TPM is dosed at 100 mg/d for migraines or 50 to 400 mg/d for epilepsy. The approved fixed-dose combination (fixed-PHEN/TPM) includes PHEN doses from 3.75 to 15 mg and TPM doses from 23 to 92 mg for daily administration.

### Medications for the treatment of obesity in adolescents [^114EyErk]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The FDA has approved Qsymia for long-term use; however, little is known about its effectiveness for obesity treatment beyond two years. Due to limited long-term evidence on phentermine's effects on cardiovascular risks and topiramate's effects on psychiatric and cognitive dysfunctions, as well as phentermine's potential for abuse, Qsymia has not been approved for use in Europe.

Two studies, one completed and one ongoing, are investigating Qsymia's effects in adolescents with obesity: "A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of VI-0521 in obese adolescents" [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02714062] (completed) and "A phase IV, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design study to determine the safety and efficacy of VI-0521 in obese adolescents" [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03922945] (ongoing).

### Coadministration of lorcaserin and phentermine for weight management: A 12-week, randomized, pilot safety study [^114ApJxK]. Obesity (2017). Low credibility.

Weight loss was observed in different groups over the 12-week period. Mean weight loss ± SD at week 12/EOT in the MITT population was 3.5 ± 3.7 kg/3.3 ± 3.4%, 7.0 ± 6.0 kg/6.7 ± 5.4%, and 7.6 ± 4.7 kg/7.2 ± 4.6% for LOR BID, LOR BID+PHEN QD, and LOR BID+PHEN BID, respectively (see Figure 2A, Table 3). In the Completers population, mean weight loss at week 12 was 4.0 ± 3.8 kg/3.8 ± 3.3%, 7.6 ± 6.1 kg/7.3 ± 5.4%, and 8.9 ± 4.3 kg/8.7 ± 4.1% for LOR BID, LOR BID+PHEN QD, and LOR BID+PHEN BID, respectively (see Figure 2B).

An exploratory analysis of change from baseline in body weight (kg/percent) using mixed model repeated measures indicated statistically significant improvements with combination therapy versus LOR BID in both the MITT and Completers populations. However, weight loss differences between the LOR BID+PHEN QD and LOR BID+PHEN BID groups were not statistically significant.

### Effects of low-dose, controlled-release, phentermine plus topiramate combination on weight and associated comorbidities in overweight and obese adults (CONQUER): A randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^111rW4Ly]. Lancet (2011). High credibility.

Obesity is associated with a reduction in life expectancy and an increase in mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and other causes. We therefore assessed the efficacy and safety of two doses of phentermine plus topiramate controlled-release combination as an adjunct to diet and lifestyle modification for weight loss and metabolic risk reduction in individuals who were overweight and obese, with two or more risk factors.

- **Methods**: In this 56-week phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned overweight or obese adults (aged 18–70 years), with a body-mass index of 27–45 kg/m² and two or more comorbidities (such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes or prediabetes, or abdominal obesity), to placebo, once-daily phentermine 7.5 mg plus topiramate 46.0 mg, or once-daily phentermine 15.0 mg plus topiramate 92.0 mg in a 2:1:2 ratio across 93 centres in the United States. Drugs were administered orally. Patients were randomly assigned by use of a computer-generated algorithm implemented through an interactive voice response system, and were stratified by sex and diabetic status. Investigators, patients, and study sponsors were masked to treatment. The primary endpoints were the percentage change in body weight and the proportion of patients achieving at least 5% weight loss. Analysis was by intention to treat.

- **Findings**: Of 2487 patients, 994 were assigned to placebo, 498 to phentermine 7.5 mg plus topiramate 46.0 mg, and 995 to phentermine 15.0 mg plus topiramate 92.0 mg; 979, 488, and 981 patients, respectively.

### Cardiovascular risk and obesity [^113AstCf]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Low credibility.

The combination of immediate-release phentermine with extended-release topiramate in one pill is an amphetamine analog stimulant designed for the short-term treatment of obesity in adults who are either obese or overweight with at least one obesity-related condition. This treatment is intended as an adjunct to a low-calorie diet and increased physical activity. PHEN/TPM operates through the two mechanisms of action of its components. Phentermine antagonizes alpha-adrenergic receptors, similar to norepinephrine, which triggers the release of norepinephrine into the hypothalamus. This results in an increased blood leptin concentration and appetite suppression. Additionally, topiramate enhances the activity of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), modulates voltage-gated ion channels, and inhibits carbonic anhydrase or AMPA/kainate excitatory glutamate receptors.

Phentermine/topiramate is administered once daily in varying doses: low (3.75/23 mg), intermediate (7.5/46 mg), or high (15/92 mg). PHEN/TPM poses a potential teratogenic risk and cardiovascular risks, including an increased heart rate. Despite these risks, phentermine/topiramate at the highest dose is one of the most effective pharmacotherapies for treating obesity in the US market; however, it is not available for prescription in European or Brazilian markets.

One phase II and two phase III studies have been published regarding the efficacy of the combination phentermine/topiramate. The EQUATE trial, a phase II study, evaluated 776 patients randomized to receive either phentermine monotherapy (7.5 and 15 mg), topiramate monotherapy (46 and 92 mg), or PHEN/TPM in varying doses.

### Cardiovascular effects of phentermine and topiramate: A new drug combination for the treatment of obesity [^115JymE8]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Topiramate is an immediate-release, sulfamate-substituted monosaccharide used to treat epilepsy and prevent migraines. It is suggested that topiramate acts on kainate/alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid glutamate receptors. Moreover, topiramate appears to block voltage-dependent sodium channels, augment γ-aminobutyric acid activity (GABA-A), and inhibit carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes II and IV, although the mechanism of action for topiramate's effects on weight is unknown. Topiramate may decrease food intake through the effects of carbonic anhydrase inhibition on taste or through its effects on GABA transmission, since GABA-A receptor activation and the interaction between GABA and leptin pathways are known to mediate effects on appetite and metabolism. Topiramate may also affect energy expenditure based on preclinical data.

### Controlled-release phentermine/topiramate in severely obese adults: a randomized controlled trial (EQUIP) [^113DfPhf]. Obesity (2012). Low credibility.

Although most pharmaceutical obesity RCTs include body mass indexes (BMIs) ranging from 27 to 40, or 45 at most, this study included patients with class II and III obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m²) without any upper BMI limit. The weight loss magnitude resulting from PHEN/TPM CR administration was estimated to be consistent across this broader BMI spectrum (ranging from 35.0 to 78.7). This finding refutes a common notion that nonsurgical treatments are not efficacious among extremely obese persons. For example, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidelines on obesity treatment state, "Extremely obese persons often do not benefit from the more conservative treatments for weight loss and weight maintenance". Our results show that this is not necessarily true. This finding is germane to the 14% of the US adult population classified as "extremely obese".

### The mitigating effect of phentermine and topiramate on weight regain after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery [^116riexf]. Obesity (2020). Low credibility.

Weight regain (WR) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) starts to occur 2 years after surgery, ultimately affecting at least 25% of patients. A limited number of studies have evaluated the impact of antiobesity medications (AOMs) on this phenomenon.

This study reviewed the electronic medical records of 1,196 patients who underwent RYGB between 2004 and 2015. WR was evaluated by comparing each patient's weight during subsequent postoperative office visits to nadir weight (lowest weight after RYGB, n = 760), taking into consideration the interval during which WR occurred. Patients who were prescribed AOMs and came to follow-up visits were classified as adherent users, whereas those who missed their follow-up visits were considered nonadherent. This study used a linear mixed model, Cox regression, and generalized equation estimator to determine the impact of AOMs on WR trajectory, hazard ratio for time to event, and odds ratio for repeated event occurrence, respectively.

Despite the lack of a unified protocol for using AOMs, the three statistical models converged to show that phentermine and topiramate, used individually or in combination, can significantly reduce WR after RYGB.

Phentermine and topiramate are effective in mitigating WR after RYGB. Further studies are needed to help ascertain optimal use of AOMs after bariatric surgery.

### Cardiovascular effects of phentermine and topiramate: a new drug combination for the treatment of obesity [^111qbSDP]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Topiramate immediate-release is currently approved at doses of 100–400 mg/day (titrated over 6 weeks) as monotherapy for treating seizures in adults and children over age 6. It is also used with other medicines to treat seizures in adults and children aged at least 2 years, or for preventing migraines in adults. Because weight loss was observed in trials for epilepsy, topiramate immediate-release was evaluated for the treatment of obesity, as well as for the treatment of hypertension or T2DM in obese patients.

A 6-month, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 385 obese patients demonstrated weight loss of 2.6% with placebo, and 5.0, 4.8, 6.3, and 6.3% in patients randomized to topiramate immediate-release 64, 96, 192, or 384 mg/day along with lifestyle intervention, respectively. Doses were gradually increased over 12 weeks and tapered at the end of the trial. All topiramate immediate-release doses elicited greater weight loss than placebo.

A long-term study (up to 60 weeks) evaluated the safety and efficacy of topiramate immediate-release for weight maintenance in obese patients who had lost at least 8% body weight after 8 weeks on a low-calorie diet. After 44 weeks of treatment, patients treated with topiramate immediate-release had lost 15.4 and 16.5% of their enrollment body weight at 96 and 192 mg/day doses, respectively (versus 8.9% with placebo), and more patients treated with topiramate immediate-release lost at least 15% body weight than those treated with placebo.

### Coadministration of lorcaserin and phentermine for weight management: A 12-week, randomized, pilot safety study [^113CBbaF]. Obesity (2017). Low credibility.

Subjects (N = 238) were assigned to treatments based on a computer-generated randomization scheme, reviewed and approved by an independent statistician. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive lorcaserin HCl 10 mg twice daily plus placebo twice daily (LOR BID), LOR twice daily plus immediate-release phentermine HCl 15 mg once daily plus placebo once daily (LOR BID+PHEN QD), or LOR twice daily plus PHEN twice daily (LOR BID+PHEN BID). Randomization was stratified by BMI (< 40 or ≥ 40 kg/m²) and performed centrally by an interactive voice/web response system vendor. The sponsor provided study treatments, packaged in a double-blind configuration. Study drugs were supplied in a monthly subject medication kit/carton bearing a two-part detachable label. The interactive voice/web response system assigned the specific, unique kit/carton for each monthly scheduled visit. Patients were instructed to take lorcaserin and phentermine/placebo concurrently, once in the morning and again midafternoon, to reduce potential phentermine-associated insomnia.

Patients underwent screening within two weeks before baseline, with assessments at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12. A telephone safety assessment was conducted three to four weeks after patients received their last study medication dose. All patients received ongoing one-on-one counseling with a trained program counselor at each study visit, including instruction to exercise at moderate intensity for 30 minutes per day and reduce daily caloric intake to 600 kcal below their individual estimated daily energy needs.

### Phentermine/topiramate for the treatment of adolescent obesity [^115Ypygk]. NEJM Evidence (2022). High credibility.

The study "Phentermine/topiramate for obesity in adolescents (top-dose)" was published by Aaron S. Kelly and colleagues in 2022 in the journal NEJM Evidence. This study is related to the following diseases: obesity and childhood obesity. The trial question was: what is the role of top-dose phentermine/topiramate in adolescents with obesity? The study design was multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT). The population consisted of 169 patients, 93 female and 76 male. Inclusion criteria were adolescents with obesity. Key exclusion criteria included treatment with antiobesity medications; history of bariatric surgery or eating disorders; stimulant use; Type 1 diabetes mellitus; congenital heart disease; obesity of a known genetic or endocrine origin.

The interventions were divided as follows: 113 received top-dose phentermine/topiramate (15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate oral capsule once daily) and 56 received a matching placebo oral capsule. The primary outcome showed a significant increase in the reduction in BMI at week 56 (7.11% vs. -3.34%; AD 10.44%, 95% CI 6.99 to 13.89). Additionally, the secondary outcomes demonstrated a significant increase in the reduction of waist circumference (9.27 cm vs. -0.31 cm; AD 9.58 cm, 95% CI…).

### Cardiovascular effects of phentermine and topiramate: A new drug combination for the treatment of obesity [^114oF6CT]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

It should be noted that there were reports of valvular heart disease when phentermine was used in combination with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. Of the 132 spontaneous reports with complete information, 113 (86%) met the cardiac valvulopathy case definition. Of these 113 cases, 2 (2%) used fenfluramine alone, 16 (14%) dexfenfluramine alone, 89 (79%) a combination of fenfluramine and phentermine, and 6 (5%) a combination of all three drugs. There were no cases reported with phentermine monotherapy use. Since none of these cases of cardiac valvulopathy was linked directly with phentermine treatment, the US FDA required the removal of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine from the market, while maintaining its approval of phentermine as a monotherapy. Ultimately, activity on the 5-HT2b receptor on heart valves was implicated as the primary mechanism associated with fenfluramine/dexfenfluramine-related valvulopathy. Phentermine has no affinity for the 5-HT2b receptor and does not increase circulating serotonin. Two case reports have described a temporal association between phentermine monotherapy and valvular heart disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension, but numerous pre-existing and concomitant morbidities in these cases have precluded any definitive conclusion about whether these were linked to treatment.

### Cardiovascular effects of phentermine and topiramate: a new drug combination for the treatment of obesity [^113AZQfe]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Weight loss can reduce the increased cardiovascular risk associated with obesity. Pharmacotherapy is a recognized weight loss treatment option; however, cardiovascular safety issues with some previous weight loss drugs raise concerns for newly approved pharmacotherapies. Phentermine is approved for short-term obesity treatment in conjunction with lifestyle modifications but is commonly used chronically. Topiramate, approved for treating epilepsy and preventing migraines, also induces weight loss. A single-dose combination of low-dose phentermine and topiramate extended-release was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention for the chronic treatment of overweight/obese adults.

This review summarizes and evaluates the cardiovascular risk/benefit profile associated with phentermine and topiramate, individually and in combination. Cardiovascular data associated with long-term use of phentermine and topiramate extended-release indicate that this combination may be a safe and effective option for reducing weight in overweight/obese patients at low-to-intermediate cardiovascular risk.

### Cardiometabolic disease staging predicts effectiveness of weight-loss therapy to prevent type 2 diabetes: Pooled results from Phase III clinical trials assessing phentermine/topiramate extended release [^111RkQcK]. Diabetes Care (2017). High credibility.

To assess the ability of medication-assisted weight loss to prevent diabetes as a function of the baseline weighted Cardiometabolic Disease Staging (CMDS) score, we pooled data from 3,040 overweight and obese participants in three randomized controlled trials: CONQUER, EQUIP, and SEQUEL. These trials assessed the efficacy and safety of phentermine/topiramate extended release (ER) for weight loss. In these double-blind phase III trials, overweight and obese adult patients were treated with a lifestyle intervention and randomly assigned to placebo versus once-daily oral phentermine/topiramate ER.

The weighted CMDS score was calculated using baseline quantitative clinical data, including waist circumference, blood glucose, blood pressure, and blood lipids. Incident diabetes was defined based on serial measures of fasting glucose, 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test glucose, and/or HbA1c.

- **Results**: The absolute decrease in 1-year diabetes incidence rates in subjects treated with medication versus placebo was greatest in those with high-risk CMDS scores at baseline (10.43–6.29%), intermediate in those with moderate CMDS risk (4.67–2.37%), and small in the low-risk category (1.51–0.67%). The number of participants needed to treat to prevent one new case of diabetes over a 56-week period was 24, 43, and 120 in those with baseline CMDS scores of ≥ 60, 30–59, and 0–29, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Numbers needed to treat to prevent one case of type 2 diabetes are markedly lower in patients with high-risk scores. CMDS can be used to quantify the risk of diabetes in overweight and obese individuals.

### Efficacy and safety of phentermine/topiramate in adults with overweight or obesity: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115TzELB]. Obesity (2021). High credibility.

The study objective was to examine the association between phentermine/topiramate therapy and weight loss and adverse events in adults with overweight or obesity through a meta-analysis and systematic review.

- **Methods**: Medical Subject Headings and free-text terms were selected to search for eligible trials in PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Embase up to April 18, 2020. The quality of randomized controlled trials was evaluated using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The meta-analysis was performed using random-effect models.

- **Results**: Phentermine/topiramate therapy resulted in an average weight loss of 7.73 kg (95% CI: 6.60–8.85) compared with placebo. The weight loss was related to the dose of phentermine/topiramate. Compared with placebo, the average weight loss was 3.55 kg (95% CI: 2.22–4.88) for 3.75/23 mg, 7.27 kg (95% CI: 6.40–8.13) for 7.5/46 mg, and 8.25 kg (95% CI: 6.92–9.79) for 15/92 mg. For phentermine/topiramate participants in different weight-loss subgroups, the weight loss for participants with ≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, and ≥ 15% baseline weight loss was 3.18 (95% CI: 2.75–3.67), 5.32 (95% CI: 4.53–6.25), and 5.65 (95% CI: 3.55–9.01), respectively. Compared with placebo, the adverse events associated with the treatment mainly included dysgeusia (odds ratio [OR] = 8.86, 95% CI: 5.65–13.89), paresthesia (OR = 8.51, 95% CI: 6.20–11.67), dry mouth (OR = 6.71, 95% CI: 5.03–8.94), disturbance in attention (OR = 4.48, 95% CI: 2.39–8.41), irritability (OR = 4.10, 95% CI: 2.29–7.33), hypoesthesia (OR = 3.81, 95% CI: 1.32–11.00), and constipation.

### Cardiovascular effects of phentermine and topiramate: A new drug combination for the treatment of obesity [^113TYutF]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Cardiac events in all exposed patients

Within the 1-year safety cohort, 752 (19.8%) patients were considered to have low cardiovascular risk, 2498 (65.6%) had moderate cardiovascular risk, and 14.6% were in a high cardiovascular risk category [modified Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III criteria]. In the 1 and 2-year safety cohorts, the different outcome definitions of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) each had a hazard ratio (PHEN/TPM-ER vs. placebo) below 1.0, ranging from 0.49 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19, 1.25] for US FDA MACE to 0.84 [95% CI 0.26, 2.64] for the traditional MACE composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke) [Table 4].

The traditional MACE composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke) was incident in 12 of the 4323 patients (5/1742 in the placebo group and 7/2581 in the PHEN/TPM-ER group); the wide CI found in the analysis of the traditional MACE composite endpoint indicates that a larger sample is required to sufficiently address this issue. The hazard ratio for the broadest MACE criteria (cardiovascular/neurovascular serious adverse events), which had a total of 43 events (20/1742 in the placebo group and 23/2581 in the PHEN/TPM-ER group), had a 95% CI with an upper bound of 0.98, representing a statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular risk [Table 4]. At this time, there are too few events from clinical trial data to draw firm conclusions about decreases or increases in MACE in patients treated with PHEN/TPM-ER.

### The new weight-loss drugs, lorcaserin and phentermine-topiramate: Slim pickings [^115GH7Qh]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration approved two drugs for long-term weight loss: lorcaserin hydrochloride (Belviq; Eisai Inc.) and phentermine-topiramate (Qysmia; Vivus Inc.). The approvals were based on one-year trials showing that, on top of recommendations to follow a calorie-restricted diet and increase exercise, patients randomized to either drug lost more weight than patients randomized to placebo. Specifically, there was a 3% weight loss [95% CI, 3%-4%] associated with lorcaserin and a 7% weight loss [95% CI, 3%-4%] with phentermine/topiramate.

The drugs have been associated with serious harms. Both drugs' labels include warnings about issues such as memory, attention, or language problems, and depression. For lorcaserin, the label also warns of valvular heart disease and euphoria, and for phentermine-topiramate, it warns of metabolic acidosis, increased heart rate, anxiety, insomnia, and elevated creatinine levels. Neither medication is marketed in Europe due to safety concerns. The manufacturer withdrew its application for lorcaserin in Europe after the European Medicines Agency (EMA) indicated that approval was unlikely, and the EMA rejected phentermine-topiramate.

In the United States, the required postmarketing safety trials are behind schedule. Until there is more convincing evidence about the cardiovascular safety of these drugs, physicians and patients should approach them cautiously. As stated in the prescribing information, patients who do not lose at least 5% of their body weight within 12 weeks of starting either drug should discontinue their use.

### The development or exacerbation of eating disorder symptoms after topiramate initiation [^112Dogiq]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

The Food and Drug Administration recently approved topiramate for migraine prevention in adolescents. Given the well-established appetite-suppressant side effects of topiramate, as well as data suggesting a potential comorbidity between migraine and eating disorders, susceptible young migraine patients may be at a greater risk for the development or worsening of eating disorder symptoms with topiramate therapy. This case series comprises 7 adolescent patients in whom serious eating disorders developed or were exacerbated after the initiation of topiramate therapy. Clinical characteristics of these patients are highlighted. In addition, this case series provides guidelines for providers to use in assessing eating disorders before prescribing topiramate for migraine prevention in adolescents.

### Prevention of type 2 diabetes in subjects with prediabetes and metabolic syndrome treated with phentermine and topiramate extended release [^113faRox]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

The increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes, along with its burden on patient suffering and societal costs, underscores the importance of finding effective strategies for both treatment and prevention. Two clinical constructs for identifying individuals at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes are prediabetes and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Prediabetes is a state of dysglycemia defined by impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance. It is estimated that 79 million Americans aged 20 years or older have prediabetes, with 25% of them progressing to type 2 diabetes within 3 to 5 years.

Type 2 diabetes is associated with abdominal obesity and insulin resistance. Diagnostic criteria were established by the Advanced Treatment Panel III of the National Cholesterol Education Program. MetS is a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and individuals with MetS are at a fivefold increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Because IFG is one of the constituent traits used to identify MetS, there is overlap with criteria for prediabetes, further increasing the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes in individuals who satisfy both sets of criteria. Thus, effective treatment of these at-risk individuals is imperative for the prevention of type 2 diabetes.

Sustained loss of 5% to 10% of body weight in obese and overweight patients has proven effective in preventing progression from prediabetes and MetS to type 2 diabetes. It also ameliorates the cardiometabolic disease process, as shown by an increase in insulin.

### Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of controlled-release phentermine/topiramate in adults with obesity in Korea: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 4 trial (QUEEN's study) [^117M2mN2]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Obesity is a chronic disease associated with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, conditions that increase cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The World Health Organization defines obesity as a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m². However, the Korean Society for the Study of Obesity (KSSO) defines obesity in Korean people as a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² based on a substantial increase in obesity-related diseases. The latest version of the KSSO clinical practice guidelines for obesity recommends that pharmacotherapy should be considered in Korean adults with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² who have failed to lose weight with non-medicinal treatments such as diet, exercise, and behavioral therapies.

A low fixed-dose phentermine plus controlled-release topiramate (PHEN/TPM CR, Qsymia™) therapy combines phentermine, an appetite suppressant for short-term use, with topiramate, a neurotherapeutic medication. Phase 3 clinical trial results have revealed that PHEN/TPM CR is a clinically effective long-term treatment for obesity. In the United States, PHEN/TPM CR was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2012 for obesity treatment in adults with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbidity such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidemia. PHEN/TPM CR has been available in South Korea since 2020 for the same indications, based on phase 3 trial results. However, in South Korea, less than 50% of individuals with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² who have failed to lose weight with non-medicinal treatment have access to PHEN/TPM CR.

### Use of phentermine-topiramate extended release in combination with sleeve gastrectomy in patients with BMI 50 kg/m or more [^116owB1y]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Super obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 50 kg/m²) treatment can be complicated and high risk. The study focused on the pre and postoperative use of phentermine and topiramate (phen/top) combined with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in cases of super obesity. The objective was to determine if this combination increases the odds of achieving a BMI reduction below 50.

### Controlled-release phentermine/topiramate in severely obese adults: a randomized controlled trial (EQUIP) [^111jEQ5t]. Obesity (2012). High credibility.

Obesity, a highly prevalent major public health problem, is associated with increased mortality and morbidity, including an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, physical disabilities, sleep apnea, and reduced quality of life. When achieved by medically recommended procedures, weight loss (WL) is associated with reduced morbidities in obese persons. Beyond surgery, long-term weight reductions much greater than 3–6 kg remain elusive. Hence, generating additional medical treatment options is a priority.

Phentermine hydrochloride is a sympathomimetic amine approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1959 with a dose range of up to 37.5 mg/day for short-term obesity treatment. Phentermine stimulates increased hypothalamic release of norepinephrine with no detectable effect on serotonin. Topiramate, a fructose monosaccharide derivative with sulphamate functionality, was approved for the treatment of epilepsy in 1996 and the prevention of migraine in 2004.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show that topiramate monotherapy produces WL among obese individuals of approximately 6–8 kg at 24 weeks and improvements in lipids, glycemic control, and blood pressure (BP). However, topiramate has been associated with adverse events (AEs) that may limit its use as a single agent at optimal doses for WL. With respect to possible mechanisms for the WL effects of topiramate, animal experiments suggest that topiramate-induced WL results from increased energy expenditure, decreased energetic efficiency, and decreased caloric intake.

### Cardiovascular effects of phentermine and topiramate: a new drug combination for the treatment of obesity [^1114fqFK]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

There is an unmet need for an effective weight-loss pharmacotherapy that can be used long-term for the many patients unable to attain or maintain weight loss through dietary interventions and exercise. Given the increased cardiovascular and metabolic risks in this patient population, obesity pharmacotherapies must present minimal unwanted or adverse cardiovascular risks, which, if present, should be outweighed by their other cardiovascular-related benefits. The rationale behind combining low doses of PHEN/TPM-ER is to minimize side effects while maintaining weight loss efficacy.

However, the treatment is not without side effects. For example, the topiramate extended-release component can induce paraesthesia and taste changes, likely through carbonic anhydrase inhibition. Topiramate cannot be used by pregnant women due to teratogenic risks. The phentermine component can produce adrenergic symptoms, such as dry mouth.

However, it is clinically reassuring that weight loss induced by PHEN/TPM-ER was associated with improved blood pressure through one and two years of treatment. Although small, usually transient, increases in heart rate were observed in some patients, there were concurrent reductions in blood pressure and rate pressure product, suggesting that, when used in conjunction with lifestyle modifications, PHEN/TPM-ER may represent a safe and effective therapy for the management of obesity in the patient populations studied (those with low-to-intermediate cardiovascular risk). The influences of PHEN/TPM-ER treatment on cardiovascular outcomes are currently being tested.

### Controlled-release phentermine/topiramate in severely obese adults: A randomized controlled trial (EQUIP) [^111Yex7Z]. Obesity (2012). High credibility.

- **Methods and procedures**: A double-blind, parallel-group design was used with three arms: placebo (n = 514), PHEN/TPM CR 3.75/23 mg (n = 241), and PHEN/TPM CR 15/92 mg (n = 512). After screening, all eligible patients underwent a blinded 4-week post-randomization titration period and 52 weeks at the randomized dose. All interventions were added to a standardized lifestyle program. The total treatment duration was 56 weeks.

- **Settings and participants**: Subjects were enrolled beginning in November 2007 at 91 US sites, consisting of clinical practices, clinical trial sites, and academic centers. The last subject completed all study visits in May 2009. At every site, institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained. Eligibility criteria included age 18–70 years, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² (no upper limit), triglycerides ≤ 200 mg/dL with treatment of 0–1 lipid-lowering medication, BP ≤ 140/90 mm Hg with treatment of 0–2 antihypertensive medications, and fasting serum glucose level ≤ 110 mg/dL. For detailed entry criteria, see Supplementary Appendix 3 online.

- **Randomization and interventions**: Patients were randomized and stratified by gender via a pseudo-random number generator constrained to a 2:1:2 allocation ratio. This allocation ratio was designed to increase the power of the safety analysis by having more patients receive placebo and by having the highest dose used. All study participants, study physicians, site staff, and sponsor representatives involved in the study conduct were blinded to patient assignment until after the trial was complete.

### Cardiovascular effects of phentermine and topiramate: a new drug combination for the treatment of obesity [^114UXNTs]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

The belief that phentermine increases heart rate and blood pressure may be due to the assumption of amphetamine-like side effects based on similarities in drug pharmacology. However, in the observational study by Hendricks et al, normotensive (14%), prehypertensive (52%), and hypertensive (34%) patients treated long-term with phentermine (mean time on therapy of 92 weeks) demonstrated no significant increase in heart rate, as well as reductions in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure that were similar to those in patients losing weight on a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet alone. Furthermore, clinical studies using short-term (12 weeks) phentermine monotherapy have shown either reductions in heart rate and blood pressure with phentermine treatment, perhaps linked to weight loss, or no significant changes in blood pressure with phentermine treatment. A study of patients taking phentermine for weight loss (n = 269) found no abuse potential or amphetamine-like withdrawal upon abrupt cessation of long-term treatment, even at doses higher than those commonly recommended and following a treatment duration of up to 21 years. Common side effects, as described in the phentermine-prescribing information for short-term (12–14 weeks) use, include dry mouth, insomnia, headache, dizziness, fatigue, tachycardia, and palpitations.

### Lomaira [^112dAy8U]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Patients must be informed that phentermine hydrochloride is a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification, and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity. Coadministration of phentermine with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended [see Indications and Usage and Warnings].

Patients must be instructed on how much phentermine to take, and when and how to take it [see Dosage and Administration]. Advise pregnant women and nursing mothers not to use phentermine [see Precautions].

- **Potential risks**: Patients must be informed about the risks of phentermine use, including the risks discussed in Warnings and Precautions, symptoms of potential adverse reactions, and when to contact a physician or take other action. The risks include, but are not limited to:
	- Development of primary pulmonary hypertension [see Warnings]
	- Development of serious valvular heart disease [see Warnings]
	- Effects on the ability to engage in potentially hazardous tasks [see Warnings]
	- The risk of an increase in blood pressure [see Warnings and Adverse Reactions]
	- The risk of interactions [see Contraindications, Warnings, and Precautions / Drug Interactions]

- **Tolerance and dependence**: Patients must also be informed about the potential for developing tolerance and advised on actions if tolerance is suspected [see Warnings]. Additionally, inform about the risk of dependence and the potential consequences of abuse [see Warnings, Drug Abuse and Dependence, and Overdosage].

Tell patients to keep phentermine in a safe place.

- **Materials and methods**: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 4 trial was conducted at eight sites in South Korea in accordance with the principles of the International Declaration of Helsinki 2013 and the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The study protocol was approved by the relevant institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each study site. Adults (aged 19–70 years) with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² were eligible to participate. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in Supplement 1.

- **Randomization**: Eligible participants were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to once-daily treatment with placebo and once-daily controlled-release combination of phentermine plus topiramate for 56 weeks with standardized counseling for diet and lifestyle modifications. Randomization was performed centrally on the trial's website using a blocked randomization scheme with SAS statistical software (version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA). An independent statistical expert, not affiliated with the study, created the randomization table. Investigators, participants, and study sponsors were masked to treatment assignment. The study drugs were administered as capsules that were identical in size and appearance (Identifier: NCT05378503).

### Anti-obesity therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention: Potential expected roles of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [^111vwzPo]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Low credibility.

Anti-obesity medications such as orlistat, phentermine-topiramate, and naltrexone-bupropion have induced a weight loss of no more than 10%, which is insufficient to prevent the risk of obesity-related cardiovascular diseases (ORCVDs). None of these drugs have demonstrated a clear effect in improving cardiovascular outcomes and reducing mortality risk, partly because they only have an anorexic effect. To compensate for its moderate weight loss effect, anti-obesity drugs used to prevent ORCVDs are also expected to benefit the cardiovascular system through non-anorexic mechanisms.

Additionally, the duration of the weight loss effect is an important issue. With lifestyle modification alone, the weight loss effect is limited to approximately one year, after which weight increases due to endocrine mechanisms involved in body weight regulation. Taken together, the possible requisites of anti-obesity drugs for ORCVDs prevention are the degree of weight loss, the effect of maintaining body weight, and the unique effect of cardiovascular protection.

### Controlled-release phentermine/topiramate in severely obese adults: A randomized controlled trial (EQUIP) [^111VyggR]. Obesity (2012). Low credibility.

A 56-week randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a controlled-release combination of phentermine and topiramate (PHEN/TPM CR) for weight loss (WL) and metabolic improvements. Men and women with class II and III obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m²) were randomized to receive either a placebo, PHEN/TPM CR 3.75/23 mg, or PHEN/TPM CR 15/92 mg, in addition to a reduced-energy diet.

- **Primary end points**: These were the percentage of weight loss and the proportions of patients achieving at least 5% weight loss.
- **Secondary end points**: These included changes in waist circumference (WC), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), fasting glucose, and lipid measures.

In the primary analysis, which included randomized patients with at least one postbaseline weight measurement who took at least one dose of the assigned drug or placebo, patients in the placebo, 3.75/23 mg, and 15/92 mg groups lost 1.6%, 5.1%, and 10.9% of baseline body weight, respectively, at 56 weeks (P < 0.0001).

- **Categorical analysis**: It showed that 17.3% of placebo patients, 44.9% of 3.75/23 mg patients, and 66.7% of 15/92 mg patients lost at least 5% of baseline body weight at 56 weeks (P < 0.0001).
- **Significant changes**: The 15/92 mg group exhibited significantly greater changes relative to placebo for WC, systolic and diastolic BP, fasting glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL).

The most common adverse events were paresthesia, dry mouth, constipation, dysgeusia, and insomnia. The dropout rate from the study was 47.1% for placebo patients, 39.0% for 3.75/23 mg patients, and 33.6% for 15/92 mg patients. PHEN/TPM CR demonstrated dose-dependent effects on weight and metabolic variables in the direct comparisons.

### Qsymia [^111aC35Q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug abuse and dependence**:

- **Controlled substance**: Qsymia contains phentermine, a Schedule IV controlled substance, and topiramate, which is not a controlled substance.

- **Abuse**: Phentermine has a known potential for abuse. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Phentermine is chemically and pharmacologically related to amphetamines. Amphetamines and other stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. Abuse of amphetamines and related drugs (e.g. phentermine) may be associated with impaired control over drug use and severe social dysfunction. There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage of these drugs to many times higher than recommended. Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing Qsymia as part of a weight reduction and long-term maintenance of body weight program.

- **Dependence**: Physical dependence may occur in patients treated with Qsymia. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. The following adverse reactions have been associated with the abrupt discontinuation of the individual components of Qsymia:

	- For topiramate, abrupt discontinuation has been associated with seizures in patients without a history of seizures or epilepsy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

	- For phentermine, abrupt discontinuation following prolonged high-dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and depression.

### Cardiovascular effects of phentermine and topiramate: A new drug combination for the treatment of obesity [^111wSLWN]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

The prevalence of obesity, defined as a BMI of at least 30 kg/m², has increased substantially in many countries. Obesity poses significant cardiovascular health risks, such as an increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, and can cause or exacerbate arterial hypertension. It is an important cause of treatment-resistant arterial hypertension. Over the past decades, cardiovascular mortality has decreased in many countries, likely due to the use of statins, anti-hypertensives, and lifestyle modifications, including diet, exercise, and smoking cessation. However, the rising prevalence of obesity and its related cardiovascular comorbidities could reduce, or even reverse, the impact of this achievement.

Modest weight loss of 5–10% in obese individuals improves cardiovascular risk markers, including blood pressure (BP). Consequently, the recently revised European Society of Hypertension guidelines recommend weight loss for obese hypertensive individuals. The primary approach for managing obesity and associated comorbidities is lifestyle intervention, which includes energy restriction and increased physical activity. However, this approach is of modest efficacy and is associated with poor long-term patient adherence. Additional interventions, such as bariatric surgery or pharmacotherapy, may be needed to achieve adequate sustained weight loss and cardiovascular risk reduction. Bariatric surgery effectively treats many weight-related comorbidities and reduces all-cause mortality and mortality from myocardial infarction, but carries operative risks.

### Phentermine/topiramate for the treatment of adolescent obesity [^115rJPNx]. NEJM Evidence (2022). High credibility.

The study titled "Phentermine/topiramate for obesity in adolescents (mid-dose)" was published by Aaron S. Kelly and colleagues in 2022 in the journal NEJM Evidence. This study is associated with obesity and childhood obesity.

- **Study question**: What is the role of mid-dose phentermine/topiramate in adolescents with obesity?
- **Study design**: The study was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).
- **Population**: It involved 110 patients, consisting of 58 females and 52 males. The inclusion criteria included adolescents diagnosed with obesity. Key exclusion criteria were treatment with anti-obesity medications, history of bariatric surgery or eating disorders, stimulant use, type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), congenital heart disease, and obesity of known genetic or endocrine origin.
- **Interventions**: Participants received either a mid-dose of phentermine/topiramate (54 participants receiving 7.5 mg phentermine and 46 mg topiramate in an oral capsule once daily) or a matching placebo (56 participants).
- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant increase in the reduction of BMI at week 56, with a difference of 4.78% vs. -3.34% and an absolute difference (AD) of 8.11% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.31 to 11.92).
- **Secondary outcomes**: A significant increase in reduction in waist circumference was observed, measuring 7.42 cm vs. -0.31 cm, with an AD of 7.72 cm (95% CI 4.31 to 11.92).

### Cardiovascular effects of phentermine and topiramate: A new drug combination for the treatment of obesity [^11428mhU]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Phentermine is the most widely used weight-loss pharmacotherapy in the United States; phentermine HCl, an immediate-release formulation that undergoes rapid dissolution and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, is currently approved for use at a dose of 15.0–37.5 mg/day (adjusted to the patient's need) for the short-term (up to 12 weeks) treatment of obesity. A phentermine resin that slowly releases active drug into the gastrointestinal system is also approved in the United States for the short-term treatment of obesity. Phentermine, whether phentermine HCl at 37.5 mg/day or phentermine resin at 15–30 mg/day, has been evaluated as a monotherapy in several studies up to 36 weeks, showing reductions in body weight and waist circumference, and improved achievement of at least 5% or 10% weight loss relative to placebo.

Munro et al. in 1968 studied weight loss with phentermine monotherapy (30 mg/day) in a 36-week, double-blind trial of overweight and obese women, finding significant weight loss with both continuous and intermittent regimens of phentermine treatment (12.2 and 13.0 kg, respectively) versus a dummy vehicle (4.8 kg). Although no published studies describing long-term, randomized, controlled weight-loss trial data for phentermine are currently available, Hendricks et al. in 2011 observed that patients (n = 300) treated with phentermine monotherapy, at doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg/day (mean dose 33.6 mg/day), showed significantly greater weight loss for 1 through 104 weeks of treatment (12.7%) compared.

### Coadministration of lorcaserin and phentermine for weight management: A 12-week, randomized, pilot safety study [^111xqDmy]. Obesity (2017). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, phentermine has been the most commonly prescribed weight loss drug and has been shown to be effective in combination with topiramate. Combination therapy can promote additional weight loss compared with monotherapy. Consequently, physicians are likely to be interested in combining phentermine with other anti-obesity agents such as lorcaserin. In this study, combination therapy resulted in significantly greater weight loss than lorcaserin alone in a dose-dependent manner, with a mean change from baseline in body weight of −3.5 kg, −7.0 kg, and −7.6 kg in the MITT/LOCF population for the LOR BID, LOR BID+PHEN QD, and LOR BID+PHEN BID groups, respectively.

We acknowledge several limitations of the study:

- **Sample size**: The sample size is inadequate to assess major SAEs such as cardiovascular events.

- **Duration**: The duration of the study is too short to assess long-term tolerability and safety, which would require chronic treatment of at least a year.

- **Primary end point**: The primary end point was selected to assess a key clinical question regarding tolerability of the combination at two common doses of phentermine. Additionally, the scientific rationale was based on the known pharmacology of each agent and prior clinical experience with lorcaserin and other serotonergic agents.

This pilot study was not statistically powered to identify rare AEs, including serotonin syndrome. P values should be considered exploratory; therefore, nonsignificance could be due to a true lack of differences or to a lack of power to detect differences. As with all early studies to explore combination pharmacotherapy for weight management, further investigations are necessary to draw more definitive conclusions.

### Coadministration of lorcaserin and phentermine for weight management: A 12-week, randomized, pilot safety study [^115qnJpR]. Obesity (2017). Low credibility.

To assess the short-term tolerability of lorcaserin alone or with two dose regimens of phentermine, a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, pilot safety study was conducted involving 238 nondiabetic patients with obesity or overweight with at least one comorbidity. Participants were randomized to receive lorcaserin 10 mg twice daily (BID; LOR BID) alone or with phentermine 15 mg once daily (QD; LOR BID+PHEN QD) or 15 mg twice daily (LOR BID+PHEN BID). Instances of potentially serotonergic adverse events (AEs), mean weight loss (WL), and the achievement of at least 5% weight loss are reported.

- **Results**: A total of 238 participants were randomized, with 235 treated. Potentially serotonergic AEs were reported by 94 participants: 37.2% of the LOR BID group, 42.3% of the LOR BID+PHEN QD group, and 40.5% of the LOR BID+PHEN BID group. Discontinuation due to AEs was approximately twice as common in the LOR BID+PHEN BID group compared to the LOR BID group. Mean weight loss was 3.5 kg (3.3%), 7.0 kg (6.7%), and 7.6 kg (7.2%) for LOR BID, LOR BID+PHEN QD, and LOR BID+PHEN BID, respectively. At least 5% weight loss was achieved by 28.2% of the LOR BID group, 59.0% of the LOR BID+PHEN QD group (P = 0.0002 vs. LOR BID), and 70.9% of the LOR BID+PHEN BID group (P < 0.0001 vs. LOR BID).

- **Conclusions**: Adding phentermine to lorcaserin enhanced short-term weight loss but did not increase the incidence of potentially serotonergic AEs. However, twice-daily phentermine increased discontinuation rates compared to both lorcaserin alone and lorcaserin plus phentermine once daily.

### Cardiovascular effects of phentermine and topiramate: a new drug combination for the treatment of obesity [^116PhzJE]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Previously approved pharmacotherapies for treating obesity, including fenfluramine, which was often used in combination with phentermine, were found to have unacceptable cardiovascular risks that outweighed their potential weight-loss benefits. These cardiovascular risks included, but were not limited to, an increased risk of valvulopathy and pulmonary hypertension, leading to their withdrawal from the market. As a result, the US FDA now requires weight-loss pharmacotherapies to show no excess cardiovascular health risks, similar to treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and frequently mandates the drug's manufacturer to conduct post-marketing safety studies, including long-term cardiovascular outcome trials.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) expects new T2DM agents to produce no excess cardiovascular risk, requiring cardiovascular outcomes studies of at least 18–24 months or sufficiently sized meta-analysis data prior to granting marketing approval. A recent concept paper from the Cardiovascular Working Party of the EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) indicates that the EMA is likely to adopt similar cardiovascular safety requirements for weight-loss pharmacotherapies in the near future.

This review aims to summarize and evaluate the cardiovascular benefit–risk profile associated with phentermine monotherapy, topiramate monotherapy, and their use in combination as PHEN/TPM-ER.
