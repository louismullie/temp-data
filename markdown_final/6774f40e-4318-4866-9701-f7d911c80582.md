## Question

A 12-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a 2-hour history of severe epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. Her father has a history of similar episodes of abdominal pain and developed diabetes mellitus at the age of 30 years. Abdominal examination shows guarding and rigidity. Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows diffuse enlargement of the pancreas; no gallstones are visualized. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?
A. Elevated serum amylase levels
B. Increased β-glucuronidase activity
C. Premature activation of trypsinogen
D. Impaired cellular copper transport

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option best explains the underlying cause of acute pancreatitis in a 12-year-old girl with severe epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, a strong family history of similar abdominal pain and early-onset diabetes, and ultrasound showing diffuse pancreatic enlargement without gallstones. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely clinical diagnosis and whether the presentation fits pediatric acute pancreatitis. Then, I should verify the key etiologies in children and how the family history steers toward hereditary pancreatitis. Next, I will review the pathophysiology of hereditary pancreatitis and identify which option mechanistically matches that biology. Finally, I will double-check the distractors to ensure they are either markers rather than causes or unrelated pathways, and then select the best answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical diagnosis. The triad of severe epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting, together with imaging showing diffuse pancreatic enlargement, strongly supports acute pancreatitis in a child, and the absence of gallstones makes gallstone pancreatitis less likely in this scenario, which aligns with pediatric diagnostic criteria requiring at least two of clinical pain, enzyme elevation, or imaging consistent with pancreatitis [^111CGWUZ].

> Wait, let me verify the etiologic clue in the family history. A first-degree relative with recurrent abdominal pain and early-onset diabetes is highly suggestive of hereditary pancreatitis, which is classically due to PRSS1 mutations and confers an autosomal dominant risk with high penetrance and a propensity for recurrent attacks and exocrine/endocrine failure over time, including diabetes, so I should keep hereditary pancreatitis high on the list here [^111RYiBP].

> I need to check the pathophysiology now. Hereditary pancreatitis caused by PRSS1 mutations leads to premature activation of trypsinogen to trypsin within the pancreatic acinar cells, overwhelming normal inhibitory controls and triggering a cascade of autodigestion and inflammation; this premature trypsin activation is the central mechanistic driver of disease in this setting, distinguishing it from other pediatric causes like gallstones, trauma, metabolic derangements, or autoimmune disease [^115Ly5dK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the options carefully. Option A, elevated serum amylase, is a diagnostic marker of pancreatitis rather than a causal mechanism, so it cannot be the underlying cause even though it would likely be present in this patient; Option B, increased β-glucuronidase activity, relates to bilirubin conjugation and drug metabolism and is not implicated in pancreatitis pathogenesis; Option D, impaired cellular copper transport, pertains to Wilson disease and does not explain pancreatitis in this context; by contrast, Option C, premature activation of trypsinogen, directly matches the PRSS1-driven mechanism of hereditary pancreatitis and is therefore the most likely underlying cause here [^115Ly5dK].

> I should double-check that the imaging and clinical course are consistent with hereditary pancreatitis rather than an obstructive or autoimmune process. Diffuse pancreatic enlargement without ductal or biliary obstruction on ultrasound fits an inflammatory pancreatitis phenotype, and recurrent attacks with eventual endocrine insufficiency are characteristic of PRSS1-associated disease; while ultrasound is first-line in pediatrics, MRI/MRCP would be the modality of choice to further characterize ductal anatomy and parenchyma if needed, but the absence of gallstones already reduces the likelihood of gallstone pancreatitis in this case [^114DZP58] [^113K74Yy].

> But wait, what if this were autoimmune pancreatitis or a metabolic cause like hypertriglyceridemia? Let me reconsider. The family history and age of onset are less typical for autoimmune pancreatitis, and there is no mention of IgG4 elevation or characteristic imaging features; similarly, without reported lipemia or extreme triglycerides, hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis is less likely, and neither autoimmune nor hypertriglyceridemia mechanisms hinge on premature trypsin activation, reinforcing that Option C remains the best mechanistic explanation here [^115iU6bT] [^113MKk7X].

> Final answer: C. Premature activation of trypsinogen, because the clinical picture, family history, and imaging collectively point to hereditary pancreatitis due to PRSS1 mutation, which causes premature trypsin activation and subsequent autodigestive pancreatitis, whereas the other options are either biomarkers or unrelated pathways [^115Ly5dK].

---

The most likely underlying cause is **premature activation of trypsinogen** (Option C), which initiates autodigestion and acute pancreatitis [^115Ly5dK]. This is supported by the patient's severe epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and diffuse pancreatic enlargement on ultrasound, along with a family history suggestive of hereditary pancreatitis [^115Ly5dK]. Elevated amylase/lipase are diagnostic markers, not causes; β-glucuronidase is unrelated; and impaired copper transport causes Wilson disease, not pancreatitis [^1132KTxX].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnostic findings

- **Severe epigastric pain**: Characteristic of acute pancreatitis due to pancreatic inflammation and autodigestion [^111ZhYay].
- **Nausea and vomiting**: Common in acute pancreatitis due to pancreatic inflammation and systemic effects [^1113FuH9].
- **Diffuse enlargement of the pancreas**: Consistent with acute pancreatitis on ultrasound imaging [^117WWM3V].
- **Family history**: Father with similar episodes and early-onset diabetes suggests hereditary pancreatitis, often due to PRSS1 mutations causing premature trypsinogen activation [^115Ly5dK].

---

## Pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis

Acute pancreatitis is **initiated by premature activation of trypsinogen** to trypsin within the pancreatic acinar cells, triggering a cascade of proteolytic enzymes that cause autodigestion and inflammation [^1112m7BX]. This premature activation is central to hereditary pancreatitis, typically due to PRSS1 mutations that render trypsin resistant to degradation, leading to recurrent episodes and chronic disease [^115Ly5dK].

---

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Relevance to patient's condition** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Elevated serum amylase levels | Diagnostic marker, not a cause | Amylase and lipase are elevated in acute pancreatitis but are not the underlying cause [^1132KTxX] |
| B. Increased β-glucuronidase activity | Not related to pancreatitis | β-glucuronidase is involved in bilirubin metabolism, not pancreatic enzyme activation [^notfound] |
| C. Premature activation of trypsinogen | Correct answer | Central mechanism in hereditary pancreatitis, supported by clinical and family history [^111RYiBP] [^115Ly5dK] |
| D. Impaired cellular copper transport | Not related to pancreatitis | Impaired copper transport causes Wilson disease, not pancreatitis [^notfound] |

---

## Conclusion

The most likely underlying cause of the patient's acute pancreatitis is **premature activation of trypsinogen** (Option C), consistent with hereditary pancreatitis suggested by the family history and clinical presentation [^111RYiBP].

### Annular pancreas in a 24-year-old woman with persistent abdominal pain [^115S6n28]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Annular pancreas (AP) is a rare diagnosis in the adult population but can cause significant morbidity if not correctly identified. In adults, the most common symptoms are abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. While these are not specific to AP, they are important clues to this diagnosis in the right clinical context. We present the case of a 24-year-old woman presenting with a 6-year history of progressive abdominal pain and dyspepsia in the context of an extensive negative workup. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) series and MRI revealed partial duodenal obstruction, concerning for AP. While patients with chronic abdominal pain and vague GI complaints may be diagnosed with functional bowel disorders, it is important to appropriately address the possibility of an underlying structural lesion such as AP. This strategy is not only cost-effective but also saves the patient discomfort associated with unnecessary procedures and allows a timely intervention.

### Abdominal pain in a 5-year-old boy [^117Y27Ar]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

A 5-year-old male presented with a 1-day history of vomiting, epigastric pain, loose stools and poor oral intake. The child had intermittent symptoms of abdominal pain and vomiting for the past 2 years and there was a strong family history of chronic hereditary pancreatitis. A random serum amylase was elevated at 2320 IU/l. Abdominal ultrasound scan revealed no abnormalities. On the basis of the family history, positive symptoms and elevated amylase, a diagnosis of hereditary pancreatitis was made. The child received symptomatic management and treatment for his acute illness. He is currently awaiting results from molecular testing.

### Acute pancreatitis in children: updates in epidemiology, diagnosis and management [^1113FuH9]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP), manifesting as acute onset of abdominal pain, vomiting, and nausea, is increasingly being recognized in children secondary to increased awareness, more identifiable etiologies as well as advances in diagnostic capabilities, like imaging. Despite this increased awareness and ability for more frequent diagnoses, the natural history of AP remains poorly understood leading to gaps in approach and management, especially in children. Coupled with poor epidemiologic and management awareness, there remains a lack of understanding of the long term implications of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). Hence, the role of the primary care clinician in the early diagnosis, and management, remains critical and may affect the need for consultation with pediatric sub-specialists like gastroenterologists. This review provides guidelines regarding epidemiology, diagnosis, and management strategies to address some of these gaps.

Case Presentation

The case is described of a 6-year-old boy, examined in the Emergency Department on account of acute abdominal pain, intense nausea and mild fever (37.5°C). The clinical history revealed 6 similar episodes during the previous 13 months, some managed at home and other with brief hospitalization. During the very first episode in which he also presented a white blood count of 22,000 (88% neutrophils), appendicectomy was performed. A review of previous medical charts revealed that amylase had been evaluated only twice in the past and, on both occasions, it was slightly increased (twice the normal value). However, no further investigation had been performed due to rapid recovery and complete disappearance of abdominal pain. When coming to our attention, the boy appeared to be suffering, with knees drawn up to his chest, and with epigastric pain radiating to his back, of post-prandial onset. Furthermore, the child presented moderate abdominal distension, however, all vital signs were within normal limits. Laboratory studies were all within the normal range, with the exception of serum amylase which was 1373 U/L (n.v. 0–95 U/L), lipase 1050 U/L (n.v. 13–60 U/L), C-reactive protein (CRP) 95 mg/L (n.v. 0–10 mg/L), erythrosedimentation rate (ESR) 74 mm/h (n.v. 0–20 mm/h). The child was treated with intravenous (i.v.) fluids plus 20 mg of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) i.v. An abdominal sonogram showed increased pancreatic volume with diffuse oedema, gallbladder was normal. The following day, laboratory tests showed overall decreased values: amylase 650 U/L, lipase 350 U/L, CRP 30 mg/L. Fluids i.v. were administered for 4 days after which amylase, lipase, CRP and ESR returned close to normal values and a liquid light meal was administered with good results. After 7 days of hospitalization, with normal laboratory tests and without abdominal pain, the child was discharged with a hypolipidic diet, 20 mg PPI daily and pancreatic enzyme supplementation (10,000 U × 6/day) per os. both for two more weeks. Taking into consideration all the aetiologic hypotheses, blunt trauma, metabolic, infectious, drug and systemic causes were excluded, by means of accurate anamnestic investigations and clinical observations and by further laboratory evaluations (calcium, glucose and triglycerides were always normal; Mumps, Cytomegalovirus, Coxsackie B, Herpes Simple virus antibodies were negative). In the attempt to exclude any anatomic abnormality, secretin-stimulated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pancreas was programmed as an outpatient. At follow-up visits, the child presented stable body weight, good appearance, with no further episodes of abdominal pain, continuing a strictly controlled of hypolipid diet. The secretin MRI, performed 2 months later, showed an overall increased thickness of the parenchyma of the entire pancreas with aspecific irregular signal intensity in the head region. Following secretin stimulation, the main pancreatic duct appeared to be normal, with a normal papilla in the second part of the duodenum that was normally filled, 10 minutes after the secretin infusion. At the last follow-up visit, ~11 months after the last acute pancreatic attach, the child presented a normal anthropometric profile with normal body weight, and no further episodes of abdominal pain were reported. However, two new short episodes of abdominal pain have been recently reported with a slight increase of only lipase levels (110 U/L; n.v. 13–60) following the last one.

### Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes complicated by an episode of severe hypertriglyceridaemia-induced pancreatitis [^113MKk7X]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 23-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes and non-compliance presented to the emergency department with abdominal epigastric pain and nausea. Laboratory examination revealed a mild ketoacidosis while an abdominal CT scan performed the following day demonstrated a severe acute pancreatitis of the body and tail (Balthazar grade E) despite normal amylase serum levels on admission. The presence of a lactescent serum was the clue to an extremely high triglyceride level (> 10 000 mg/dl) causing the pancreatitis. The hypertriglyceridaemia itself was attributed mainly to the diabetic ketoacidosis. There was no family history of hypertriglyceridaemia. The triad consisting of diabetic ketoacidosis, hypertriglyceridaemia and acute pancreatitis is an unusual presentation of poorly controlled diabetes which can occur in type 1 as well as type 2 diabetic adults and children. Treatment with intravenous insulin and hydration successfully resolved the ketoacidosis and hypertriglyceridaemia and reversed the episode of acute pancreatitis.

### An 18-year-old with acute-on-chronic abdominal pain [^112rYNYr]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

An 18-year-old woman with a complex past medical history presented with 2 days of vomiting and lower abdominal pain. She had been admitted for the majority of the previous 5 months for recurrent pancreatitis and had undergone a cholecystectomy. Additional symptoms included nausea, anorexia, constipation, and a 40-lb weight loss over 4 months. She appeared uncomfortable, and an examination was remarkable for tachycardia, hypertension, and diffuse abdominal tenderness to light palpation. Her initial laboratory test results revealed mildly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 68 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 80 U/L) and a normal lipase. She was admitted for pain control and nutritional support. Over the next few days, the lipase increased to 1707 U/L. Despite optimizing her management for acute pancreatitis, the patient's symptoms persisted. Further history gathering and laboratory testing ultimately revealed her diagnosis. Our expert panel reviews her hospital course and elucidates the management of our eventual diagnosis.

### Acute pancreatitis and severe hypertriglyceridaemia masking unsuspected underlying diabetic ketoacidosis [^111rwnRj]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A healthy 18-year-old girl presented to a local emergency room with 48 h of abdominal pain and vomiting. A radiological and biochemical diagnosis of moderate acute pancreatitis was made. Bloodwork demonstrated prominent hypertriglyceridaemia (HTG) of 19.5 mmol/L (severe HTG: 11.2–22.4), detectable urine ketones and a random blood glucose of 13 mmol/L dropping to 10.5 mmol/L on repeat (normal random < 11). Ketone levels were deemed consistent with fasting ketosis after 48 h of vomiting. There was no known history of diabetes in the patient. Management included aggressive rehydration and pain control, yet the patient rapidly decompensated into shock requiring intensive care unit support. Blood gases revealed severe metabolic acidosis (pH 6.99) and unsuspected underlying diabetic ketoacidosis was diagnosed. The HTG gradually resolved following intravenous fluids and insulin infusion with slower correction of the metabolic acidosis. Importantly, her glycated haemoglobin was 12%, indicating the silent presence of chronic glucose elevations.

### Unexpected cause of recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis in type 1 diabetes: a case report [^113mnbBa]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious life-threatening condition that usually requires admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The development of DKA has been associated with a number of precipitating factors such as inadequate insulin therapy, infection, ischemia, medications, and other medical-surgical conditions. The absence of clear precipitating factors may make DKA diagnosis and treatment challenging and can easily lead to misdiagnosis.

Cannabis use should be considered in patients with type 1 diabetes who have recurrent DKA with an unusual presentation, such as unexpectedly high pH and bicarbonate levels with hyperglycemic ketosis.

Here, we describe a patient with type 1 diabetes who presented with recurrent DKA, abdominal pain, and cyclic vomiting thought to be due to cyclic vomiting syndrome. After an appropriate evaluation, the patient was diagnosed with cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS (. This case provides an opportunity to discuss the diagnosis and treatment of this challenging condition.

As far as we know, this is the first case report on this topic in Saudi Arabia.

Case presentation

A 21-year-old women was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 7 years. She also had anxiety and depression that required expert help. Basal bolus insulin was used to treat her diabetes. She had a history of frequent admissions for DKA 6 times within the last 12 months and a presumptive diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome. All DKA episodes started with sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain that worsened over time, eventually leading to dehydration and ketosis. DKA episodes were managed according to the standard protocol. There was no apparent cause for any of the episodes of DKA, either in her history or in extensive investigations. On the last admission, she presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She reported 7 episodes of bilious vomiting one day prior to admission. The pain was epigastric, 7/10 in intensity, progressive, and nonradiating. The pain was mainly postprandial and accompanied by vomiting, which was resolved with paracetamol. She denied any aggravating factors, but the hot water baths provided some relief.

### Renal tubular acidosis and superior mesenteric artery syndrome [^114H86zh]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

A 12-year-old girl presented with significant vomiting, and generalised muscular weakness. She had normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia and alkaline urine. Vomiting generally leads to metabolic alkalosis but this patient had acidosis which suggested either renal tubular acidosis (RTA) or diarrhoea. Investigations showed distal RTA. There was no family history of similar illness. Abdominal ultrasound showed features of the superior mesenteric artery syndrome, but a barium study showed no duodenal obstruction, making this an unlikely cause of symptoms. Weight loss as a result of the renal condition may have caused loss of mesenteric or retro-duodenal fat and explain the ultrasound appearance.

### Ketoacidosis is not always due to diabetes [^113AqPuz]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic alcoholism is a frequently unrecognised cause of ketoacidosis. Most patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis present with normal or low glucose, but this condition can present with hyperglycaemia. This can lead to misdiagnosis of diabetes ketoacidosis and, therefore, inappropriate treatment with insulin. We describe a 37-year-old Caucasian woman with chronic pancreatitis secondary to excess alcohol consumption, admitted with abdominal pain and vomiting, fulfilling the criteria for diabetes ketoacidosis. She was treated according to diabetes ketoacidosis protocol and experienced a hypoglycaemic attack within an hour of initiation of insulin. On review of her history, she was found to have three similar episodes over the past 12 months. Alcoholic ketoacidosis can present with hyperglycaemia due to relative deficiency of insulin and relative surplus in counter-regulatory stress hormones including glucagon. Awareness of the syndrome with a detailed history helps to differentiate alcohol ketoacidosis from diabetes ketoacidosis and prevent iatrogenic hypoglycaemia.

### Superior mesenteric artery syndrome as a cause for recurrent abdominal pain and vomiting in a 9-year-old girl [^115j44xs]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A 9-year-old girl was admitted under our general surgical team with 2 days of diffuse abdominal pain and vomiting. This was one of multiple admissions for similar symptoms over the past 5 years. She was feverish on admission but haemodynamically stable. On examination, she had a diffusely tender and hypersensitive abdomen, with no guarding or peritonism, and no palpable masses. Of note, the patient was very thin, with almost no body fat. Blood tests were otherwise normal, with a normal abdominal X-ray and abdominal ultrasound. She had undergone three previous abdominal ultrasounds over the past 5 years for similar symptoms, all of which were normal. Following this, CT revealed a diagnosis of superior mesenteric artery syndrome. The patient was transferred to our regional children's hospital for analgaesia, nasogastric decompression and nutritional supplementation. She made a swift improvement with plans for ongoing follow-up by the paediatric team.

### Glycogen storage disease type Ia complicated by gestational hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis: a rare case report [^114Amyum]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

The patient, a 33-year-old gravida 1, para 0 woman at 29⁺³ weeks of gestation, began experiencing mild epigastric and dorsal discomfort in November 2024, which was initially mild and not treated. On the morning of December 10, 2024, she developed a marked exacerbation of persistent epigastric pain, localized beneath the xiphoid process and radiating to the back. The pain was accompanied by nausea and vomiting, with no relief following emesis. Consequently, she presented to the emergency department of a local hospital. Laboratory tests revealed a white blood cell count of 11.59 × 10⁹/L (reference 3.50 to 9.50 × 10⁹/L), serum amylase of 407 U/L (reference 8 to 78 U/L), and triglyceride level of 48.45 mmol/L (reference 0.56 to 1.70 mmol/L). Despite receiving symptomatic treatment, her condition deteriorated rapidly, and she was transferred to our obstetric department at 23:03 on the same day for further management. Her past medical history was notable for a five-year history of polycystic ovary syndrome, characterized by irregular menstrual cycles. She also had a documented history of hyperlipidemia, with self-reported triglyceride levels of approximately 20 mmol/L on several occasions, for which no treatment had been instituted. Family history was significant for hyperlipidemia in her elder brother, while her parents were healthy.

### A 21-year-old man with chronic pancreatitis [^111BSaZo]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Chronic pancreatitis is a disease for which the diagnosis may be difficult to ascertain and the treatments are limited. Using the case of a 21-year-old man who has had recurrent episodes of epigastric pain since age 10 years and was ultimately diagnosed as having idiopathic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic duct stones, we discuss the evaluation and treatment of chronic pancreatitis. Diagnosis is based on thorough history taking, physical examination, and carefully selected imaging studies. Etiologies may be structural or nonstructural; genes predisposing to chronic pancreatitis have been identified. An evidence-based approach to treatment is limited by a paucity of randomized controlled trials. We address the patient's concerns regarding chronic pancreatitis, including what he should expect over the next several years, whether endoscopic or surgical therapies should be considered, and whether there are any cures.

### Identification of ascaris lumbricoides eggs within the pancreas using endoscopic ultrasound [^114FTBTz]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

A 50-year-old woman from Micronesia presented with 7 days of progressive nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. She had no prior history of hepatobiliary or pancreatic diseases, and she denied alcohol use. Vital signs were within normal limits, and the physical examination was notable for epigastric tenderness. Laboratory investigation revealed a white blood cell count of 19.3 × 10 3 cells/μL, lipase of 6,499 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase of 308 U/L, alanine aminotransferase of 314 U/L, alkaline phosphatase of 210 U/L, and total bilirubin of 3.8 mg/dL. Abdominal computed tomography showed diffuse, edematous enlargement of the pancreas, along with edema and stranding of surrounding fat, suggesting severe, diffuse acute interstitial pancreatitis. Pronounced intra- and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation was also noted. During endoscopic ultrasound, white-light evaluation demonstrated an 8-inch roundworm in the antrum of the stomach. It was retrieved in toto and later identified as Ascaris lumbricoides (Figure 1A). Endosonographic images showed expected findings of pancreatitis, with the pancreatic parenchyma diffusely and mildly heterogeneous without lobularity; however, there was also a complex region adjacent to the tail of the pancreas with cystic structures (Figure 1B, arrows). These structures were not consistent with necrosis or fluid collections from pancreatitis, and were most likely to be a collection of Ascaris eggs, as the initial computed tomographic scan did not show pancreatic stones or other solid structures that would otherwise explain the findings. The patient was initiated on treatment with oral albendazole. Repeat endoscopic ultrasound showed disappearance of the cystic structures (Figure 1C), suggesting that treatment with albendazole led to resolution of the infection.

### Incidental diagnosis of a pancreatic adenocarcinoma in a woman affected by gestational diabetes mellitus: case report and literature review [^115FDopj]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2021). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is rarely diagnosed during pregnancy; it usually manifests with symptoms such as epigastric pain, vomiting, weight loss, and jaundice, rarely mimicking the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome. It has been postulated that there exists a correlation between the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus and the occurrence of pancreatic cancer later in life. We conducted an expert literature review of the 31 available documented pancreatic cancer cases that were diagnosed during pregnancy. We also report pancreatic adenocarcinoma incidentally suspected in an asymptomatic woman affected by gestational diabetes mellitus; the woman was undergoing a fetal growth scan.

### IgG4-related pancreatitis: an uncommon cause of hyperglycaemia [^114BD5CQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Hyperglycaemia is one of the most common metabolic disturbances encountered in clinical practice, with an important differential diagnosis. We report a case of a 72-year-old woman referred to diabetes services with rapidly increasing blood glucose and weight loss despite oral hypoglycaemic therapy. She reported mild upper abdominal discomfort and liver function tests were deranged, prompting further investigation. Abdominal imaging demonstrated a diffusely enlarged pancreas and subsequent investigations noted a markedly raised serum IgG4. She was diagnosed with IgG4-related pancreatitis and swiftly responded to steroid therapy. Secondary causes of diabetes should be considered in people with atypical presentation such as weight loss or rapid progression to insulin use. While IgG4-related disease is rare, its varied clinical presentation as a result of its multiorgan involvement requires a high index of suspicion. This case highlights the importance of a detailed diagnostic work-up and describes an unusual clinical presentation of this increasingly recognised multisystem disease.

### What have we learned about acute pancreatitis in children? [^111Ai1mA]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Pediatric pancreatitis has received much attention during the past few years. Numerous reports have identified an increasing trend in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in children and key differences in disease presentation and management between infants and older children. The present review provides a brief, evidence-based focus on the latest progress in the clinical field. It also poses important questions for emerging multicenter registries to answer about the natural history and management of affected children with pancreatitis.

### Recommendations for diagnosis and management of autoimmune pancreatitis in childhood: consensus from INSPPIRE [^111wr16y]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for pediatric pancreatitis, more specifically with respect to patients with autoimmune pancreatitis (diagnostic imaging), INSPPIRE 2018 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining transabdominal ultrasound as first-line imaging in pediatric patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of pancreatitis and/or obstructive jaundice. Obtain MRI/MRCP in case of high suspicion for autoimmune pancreatitis (hypoechoic parenchyma, diffuse or focal enlargement of the pancreas, pancreatic mass lesion with/or without a dilated common bile duct in the absence of choledocholithiasis).

### Rare cause of recurrent acute pancreatitis in teenage man [^114WDPkD]. Egastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The patient, an 18-year-old Chinese male, has a medical history of eight episodes of recurrent acute pancreatitis occurring over the span of 17 months. For each episode of acute pancreatitis, clinical presentations were characterised by acute abdominal pain (Numeric Rating Scale ranging from 6 to 9), low back discomfort, fever (Tmax 38.5°C), nausea, oliguria, abdominal bloating and obstipation. Abdominal pain could be relieved by fetal position. The duration of symptoms ranged from 4 days to 2 weeks. The patient reported a weight loss of 20 kg over 17 months. Additionally, during hospitalisation, the patient exhibited a depressed mood and requested to discontinue treatment.

### Unexpected findings at laparotomy of a 12-year-old girl with obstructive jaundice and choledocholithiasis: a case report [^115htzrE]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Congenital duodenal obstruction (CDO) is a relatively common neonatal anomaly with a reported incidence of 1 in 2500–10 000 live births. Diagnosis can be made prenatally with ultrasound (US) during antenatal care or during the postnatal period commonly as bilious vomiting and feeding intolerance. Patients with a partial stenosis can survive to present in a much-delayed fashion.

Annular pancreas (AP) is a rare congenital disorder that may be clinically asymptomatic, may present as a neonatal intestinal obstruction or as a more complex pathology in adults. The incidence is reported as 1–3 in 20 000. AP may be asymptomaticand discovered incidentally during routine investigations for other conditions or at autopsy. Most of the cases are diagnosed either prenatally or in the first few days of life. If the condition is neither diagnosed prenatally nor presents with complications in early life, it may be undetected until adulthood with varying complications, such as pancreatitis or gastric outlet obstruction, thereby making the diagnosis difficult. AP may coexist with other congenital anomalies. We report a case of obstructive jaundice from choledocholithiasis due to an AP that caused duodenal stenosis and biliary stasis.

A 12-year-old girl who was referred from western Uganda presented with postprandial abdominal pain, food fear, progressive weight loss, jaundice and dark urine for 2 years. She reported often missing school due to abdominal pain. Initial US obtained by her local care providers showed dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic ducts, a distended gall bladder and a stone in the common bile duct (CBD). The patient weighed only 32 kg and appeared wasted with moderate jaundice and scleral icterus during her physical exam. Her abdominal examination was unremarkable. Her initial laboratory workup showed mild anemia, no leukocytosis, significant hyperbilirubinemia with mildly elevated liver enzymes and a negative infectious workup (table 1).

Table 1
Pre-operative laboratory work-up

She had a cardiac echocardiogram that was normal and a repeat abdominal US that again demonstrated dilated CBD to 2 cm, dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic ducts, a distended gall bladder and an obstructing stone in the CBD measuring 2.3×1.5 cm. Basing on these findings, the team elected to proceed with an exploratory laparotomy. Owing to resource limitations, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and intraoperative fluoroscopy were not available options.

Case Report

A five year old boy, 104 cm tall, weighing 14 kg with no family history of diabetes, presented in frank diabetic ketoacidosis. The parents reported history of weight loss, polydipsia, polyuria and polyphagia for two weeks. On persistent questioning, they admitted history of low grade fever and episodic mild abdominal pain for the past one month.

On examination, he had rachitic features, and abdomen was protuberant. No evidence of pallor, fever, icterus, lymphadenopathy, Bitot's spots was noted. Dental age was 5 years. There was mild epigastric tenderness, with no radiation to back, or change on posture. Liver span was 8 cm, and spleen was not palpable.

Ketosis was corrected within 24 hours with 18 units regular aspart insulin, and the patient discharged after 72 hours on a 3-dose regime (regular aspart - regular aspart - premixed aspart) totaling 19 units/day.

He returned after 3 days with moderate ketonuria, but no evidence of acidosis. The parents were adamant that he had followed the prescribed diet pattern and not missed any insulin dose.

Two such episodes recurred within two weeks, each accompanied by severe upper abdominal pain, and treated successfully by IV insulin infusion over 12–24 hours.

On detailed investigation, ultrasonography revealed multiple gall stones. The liver echotexture and size was normal. This finding was confirmed a week later. A stool examination was negative for parasitic ova/cysts. A complete hemogram showed no evidence of hemolysis. Fasting lipid profile, serum amylase and hepatic function tests were normal, except for a raised serum alkaline phosphatase (347 IU/ml [normal range 150–250 IU/ml]). A Widal test was non-reactive, and blood culture was not done.

After initial difficulties for the first 2 weeks, the patient stabilized on 15 units/day of aspart insulin, in 3 divided doses. Frequent abdominal pain prompted a surgical referral for cholecystectomy, with the diagnosis of cholelithiasis, but a pre operative scan (done two weeks after the first scan,) revealed no abnormality. The earlier finding was retrospectively thought to be biliary sludge, as cholelithiasis would not have been self-limiting.

Physical examination revealed that her height and weight were at the 3rd percentile; she was normocephalic. She had no facial dysmorphism and a normal eye exam. She also had hepatomegaly with a span of 10 cm with no splenomegaly. No apparent skeletal deformities were noted.

Initial laboratory tests revealed microcytic hypochromic anemia Hb 9.2 g/dl (10.9–13.8 g/dl), normal blood gas, normal kidney function, normal C-peptide levels, negative diabetes-associated autoantibodies, and uncontrolled glycemic control with an HbA1C of 11%. She had primary hypothyroidism: TSH 9.5 μIU/L (0.27–4.2 μIU/L) and FT4 13 pmol/L (12–22 pmol/L). She was administered 25 mcg of l-thyroxine daily. We investigated common causes of chronic diarrhea, but these causes were excluded. Stool fecal elastase was not tested as it is not available at our hospital. However, given the clinical picture, we highly suspected an exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Regarding hepatic dysfunction, her liver function test revealed a high AST of 166 U/L (normal range, 15–37 U/L), ALT of 107 U/L (normal range, 12–78 U/L), total bilirubin of 3 Umol/L (normal range 0–17 Umol/L), and a normal coagulation profile. Viral infection, autoimmune hepatitis and metabolic problems were all excluded. Abdominal ultrasound revealed diffuse coarse hepatomegaly (10.6 cm) and a small hyperechoic pancreas.

Conclusions — pediatric pancreatitis, both acute and chronic, is increasingly recognized, and imaging plays a role in diagnosis, staging, and follow-up, but pediatric-specific literature informing imaging is sparse. Much of what is known and recommended for pediatric imaging is extrapolated from adult literature, and many recommendations are largely based on expert opinion. Dedicated pediatric studies are clearly needed to define optimal imaging strategies and to address early disease identification and prognostication to enable pediatric-specific evidence-based guidelines.

Abstract.

A 32-year-old medical practitioner presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting, 1 week after the diagnosis of COVID-19. The patient did not report any comorbid conditions, alcohol usage, or gallstone disease. Laboratory and radiological investigations revealed the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. He underwent conservative management and was discharged after 3 days of hospital admission. This case highlights a possible association between COVID-19 and acute pancreatitis, and the need for clinicians to carefully evaluate patients presenting with gastrointestinal complaints during the current pandemic.

A 17-year-old adolescent girl from El Salvador presented to the emergency room (ER) with severe abdominal pain associated with one episode of nausea and vomiting. The pain that started 5 days earlier was sharp in nature and epigastric in location with radiation to back and was relieved by half a tablet of Vicodin. The patient has a history of intermittent epigastric pain for the past 2 years and was treated for Helicobacter pylori for 1 year. In the ER, the serum chemistry demonstrated elevated amylase. Further workup with abdominal ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), and hepatobiliary scintigraphy confirmed a type IV-a choledochal cyst with intra- and extrahepatic dilation of bile ducts. We report an unusual acute abdomen presentation of type IV-a choledochal cyst in a 17-year-old young adult from El Salvador.

### New PRSS1 and common CFTR mutations in a child with acute recurrent pancreatitis, could be considered an "Hereditary" form of pancreatitis? [^112hjxc5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

acute recurrent pancreatitis is a complex multigenic disease, the diagnosis is even more difficult when this disease develops in a child.

Case Presentation

a 6-years old boy, hospitalized with epigastric pain radiating to the back showed high serum levels of serum amylase, lipase, CRP and erythrosedimentation rate. Several similar milder episodes of pain, followed by quick recovery and complete disappearance of symptoms were reported during the previous 13 months. The child was medically treated and after 7 days with normal clinic and laboratory tests was discharged with a hypolipidic diet. All the known aetiologic hypotheses were excluded by anamnestic investigation, clinical observation and biochemical evaluation, whereas, anatomic abnormality were excluded by a secretin stimulated magnetic resonance (MRI). At the last follow-up visit, (11 months later), the child showed a normal body weight and anthropometric profile, without further abdominal pain. Mutation screening for coding regions of PRSS1, SPINK1, CFTR and the new hereditary pancreatitis-associated chymotrypsin C (CTRC) genes showed a novel variation, c.541A > G (p.S181G), in the exon 4 of PRSS1 gene and the classical CF p.F508del mutation in the CFTR. Both mutations were present in his clinically normal mother and absent in the patient's father.

Conclusions

this report extend the spectrum of PRSS1 mutations, however, the absence of family history of pancreatitis leaves the present case without the hallmark of the hereditary origin of pancreatitis. At the present knowledge it can be only stated that the combined genotype CFTR (F508del)/PRSS1 (S181G) is associated to a mild phenotype of acute recurrent pancreatitis in this child without any further conclusion on its pathogenetic role or prediction on the course of the disease.

### Acute pancreatitis in 60 Iranian children: do pediatricians follow the new guidelines in diagnosis and management of acute pancreatitis? [^115GGX3Z]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Considering the increasing prevalence of acute pancreatitis in children, if symptoms, such as vomiting or abdominal pain, occur in a patient with systemic or metabolic diseases, acute pancreatitis should be considered. Medications play an important role in the development of acute pancreatitis. In children using anticonvulsants, immunosuppressant drugs, and chemotherapy, it is important to consider the incidence of this disease. Moreover, in clinical education, the risks of radiation due to unnecessary CT scans for children with acute pancreatitis need to be emphasized. Besides, inappropriate prescription of antibiotics, insufficient fluid therapy, and delayed initiation of oral feeding in these patients should be highlighted in therapeutic and educational programs. Also, healthcare providers should consider COVID-19 as a differential diagnosis when managing patients with gastrointestinal symptoms.

### The value of pancreatic stone protein in predicting acute appendicitis in patients presenting at the emergency department with abdominal pain [^116i84C4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Appendicitis is defined as an inflammation of the vermiform appendix and is a common condition and an urgent surgical illness. It is one of the most common causes of acute abdominal pain and remains a diagnostic challenge. It has variable manifestations and generous overlap with other clinical syndromes. In fact morbidity increases significantly with the diagnostic delay and left untreated, appendicitis has the potential for severe complications, including perforation or sepsis, and may even cause death. Despite diagnostic and therapeutic advancement in medicine, appendicitis still remains a clinical emergency.

No single sign, symptom, or diagnostic test exists which accurately confirms an appendiceal inflammation. The classic history of anorexia and periumbilical pain followed by nausea, right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, and vomiting occurs in only 50% of cases.

Accepted etiologic factors of appendicitis are appendiceal lumen obstruction and infection. The main therapeutic option still remains the surgical removal of the vermiform appendix even though a few studies promote an antibiotic treatment. After admission to the emergency department (ED), patients presenting with abdominal pain caused by a variety of different etiologic factors have to be worked up with the goal of approaching 100% sensitivity for the diagnosis in a time-, cost-, and consultation-efficient manner.

It is reported that appendectomy carries a complication rate of up to 15%, as well as increased associated costs and the discomfort of hospitalisation and surgery. Delay in diagnosis and treatment account for much of the associated mortality and morbidity. Therefore, the goal of the surgeon is to diagnose appendicitis as early as possible.

The overall mortality rate of 0.2–0.8% is attributable to complications of the disease rather than to surgical interventions. The mortality rate in children ranges from 0.1% to 1%; in patients older than 70 years, the rate rises above 20%, primarily because of diagnostic and therapeutic delay.

Appendiceal perforation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality compared with non-perforating appendicitis. The mortality risk of acute but not gangrenous appendicitis is less than 0.1%, but the risk rises to 0.6% in gangrenous appendicitis. The rate of perforation varies from 16% to 40%, with a higher frequency occurring in patients below 50 years (40–57%) and in patients older than 50 years (55–70%), in whom misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis are common. Complications occur in 1–5% of patients with appendicitis. Postoperative wound infections account for almost one third of the associated morbidity.

### New PRSS1 and common CFTR mutations in a child with acute recurrent pancreatitis, could be considered an "Hereditary" form of pancreatitis? [^113kYPsG]. BMC Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

In the present report, the combined genotype F508del/S181G is associated with acute pancreatitis episodes in the 6-year-old proband, but not in his 37-year-old mother, who carries the same genotype, but without any pancreatic symptoms, biochemical or ultrasound pancreatic alterations.

Following the experimental exclusion of gross deletions/insertions in the pancreatitis causative genes in the father, of a case of non paternity, and of the presence of other mutations in pancreatitis relevant genes, it is tempting to suggest that the phenotypic discordance may be due to unknown combination of genetic and/or environmental factors.

Therefore, it could be a potential late onset of pancreatic disease in the proband's mother, or a case of incomplete penetrance of a genotype composed by two mutations (up to 20% of PRSS1 gene carriers may remain symptom-free). In addition, it cannot be excluded that this genotype-phenotype discordance is due to unidentified modifier genes, relevant for the development of pancreatitis. On the other hand, the finding that a hypolipidic diet has been able to prevent any further pancreatic attack, suggests that diet could have a great importance between the proband and his mother phenotype. Similar cases of phenotypic discordance represent an unresolved genetic aspect that will be addressed in the future i.e. why some carriers of PRSS1 mutation remain completely healthy whereas their relatives with the same mutation develop various grade of disease. However, the absence of family history of pancreatitis leaves the present case without the hallmark of the hereditary origin of pancreatitis in the present child. In conclusion, functional studies are mandatory to understand if and/or how PRSS1 mutation S181G could be involved in determining recurrent pancreatitis or if it needs to be combined with other HP causing genes such as CFTR mutations. At the moment, the combined genotype F508del/S181G could be only associated to a mild phenotype of acute recurrent pancreatitis as happened in the present child. Moreover, on the base of the present report we cannot establish whether PRSS1 S181G gene mutation has a pathogenetic role on the child pancreatic disease nor any prediction on the course of the disease.

Case B

A 61-year-old Chinese woman presented with a history of upper right abdominal cramping with vomiting and fever for 10 h. The patient developed the above symptoms after eating greasy food 10 h ago; she vomited her stomach contents and bile repeatedly, but did not experience hematemesis. Fever occurred after the abdominal pain, and the highest body temperature was 38.8 °C. She did not present with chills, jaundice, constipation or diarrhea. Apart from these observations, the patient had a history of intermittent bloating after meals for at least 20 years, and she denied the symptoms of steatorrhea. The patient has had type 2 diabetes for 12 years, and metformin and glimepiride were used to control the DM; her fasting blood sugar level fluctuates from approximately 7–10 mmol/L. She also has congenital scoliosis. Her family medical history was unremarkable.

The patient's body temperature was 38.9 °C, and her BMI was 32 kg/m 2. The physical examination revealed mild abdominal muscle tension, tenderness in the right upper quadrant, and positive Murphy's sign. The hematological examinations showed a high white blood cell count (14.4 × 10⁹ /L) and an elevated neutrophil percentage (87.7%). The blood biochemistry tests showed high blood sugar (12.1 mmol/L), low K + (2.9 mmol/L) and low total cholesterol levels (6.2 mmol/L). The abdominal CT including coronal reconstruction and sagittal reconstruction image showed multiple stones in the gallbladder, and the gallbladder wall was rough and had mild edema (Fig. 2 a). The body and tail of the patient's pancreas were absent; in the area where the tail of the pancreas should be, we only observed blood vessels of the spleen (Fig. 2 b-i). Since the patient had no evidence of bile duct stones, MRCP was not performed in the emergency department.

### Influenza a H1N1 infection complicated with encephalopathy and acute pancreatitis: a case report [^115DFqGe]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute pancreatitis in children is not rare which can occasionally manifest with moderate to severe symptoms. AP had become a common general pediatric condition with an increasing incidence over the past 2 decades. In adult, gallstone disease and alcohol are the 2 leading causes of acute pancreatitis but cases in children have been associated with various etiologies. AP had been associated with several viruses, including mumps virus, measles morbillivirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and coxsackievirus. Several cases of severe influenza A combined with acute pancreatitis have also been reported in the past. It has also been demonstrated in mice that influenza virus can infect the pancreas and cause pancreatic injury. Studies had shown that drugs are also the main cause of acute pancreatitis in children. Moreover, cases of drug-induced acute pancreatitis are more severe than those of non-drug-induced. Other causes of pediatric AP include autoimmune disease, trauma, genetics, and anatomical abnormalities. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires the presence of two out of three criteria: (1) abdominal pain suggestive of pancreatitis, (2) serum amylase and/or lipase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, (3) and/or imaging tests showing characteristic findings. Children with severe influenza A(H1Nl) present with gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, must be promptly tested for blood amylase and urinary amylase, and promptly improve pancreatic ultrasound and pancreatic CT testing, and be alert to the occurrence of AP.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). High credibility.

Acute recurrent pancreatitis (ARP) in children — definition, frequency, risk factors, and imaging approach: ARP is defined as 2 distinct attacks of AP with more than 1 month pain-free interval between attacks, or with normalization of pancreatic enzymes and complete resolution of pain regardless of interval between episodes; it is believed to develop in 15% to 35% of pediatric patients after an initial AP event, and in one study the majority had a second attack within 3 months after the initial episode. Genetic mutations are described as the most common risk factor, with almost 50% carrying CFTR, PRSS1, CTRC or SPINK1 mutations in one series and approximately 1/3 having a pancreatic duct obstructive risk factor such as pancreas divisum; there are no robust data to define an optimal imaging modality or strategy for ARP though most favor MRI because of its ability to optimally assess both parenchyma and duct.

### Annular pancreas concurrent with pancreaticobiliary maljunction presented with symptoms until adult age: case report with comparative data on pediatric cases [^115LiBYv]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Case presentation

The patient, a 26-year-old man, presented to our department with abdominal pain. He was born at 40 weeks' gestational age with a birth weight of 3,010 g. Since his 3 years of age, the patient presented with relatively greater appetite compared with corresponding age cohorts and wiggly epigastric mass which would disappear two hours after meal. He remained free from vomiting and acute abdomen until the first episode of abdominal pain at the age of 23 years. Since then, he underwent totally 3 episodes of acute abdomen, and was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis.

On presentation, physical examination revealed tender epigastrium without palpable mass and jaundice. Laboratory data showed abnormal liver and pancreatic function tests with elevated serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (85 U/L; normal range, 0–40 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (72 U/L; normal range, 0–40 U/L), total bilirubin (32.7 μmol/L; normal range, 0–19.5 μmol/L), amylase (541 U/L; normal range, 25–125 U/L) and lipase (279 U/L; normal range, < 190 U/L). Abdominal sonography revealed a dilated common bile duct. Computerized tomography additionally showed the dilation of proximal duodenum with stenosis at the distal end of descending duodenum. Magnetic resonance imaging and cholangiopancreatography revealed fusiform dilatation of the common bile duct with high confluence of pancreaticobiliary ducts with a common channel measured 24 mm in length (Figure 1 A, B). Endoscopy showed an enlarged pylorus and excessively ectatic duodenal cavity, but endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was not successful due to duodenal stenosis at the descending part (Figure 2). A tentative diagnosis of acute pancreatitis associated with pancreaticobiliary maljunction and annular pancreas was made.

Case presentation

A 30-year-old man referred to our hospital presented with a 3-month history of recurrent onset of persistent mild epigastric pain, which worsen when eating. The patient took a lot of sugary beverages one week before his admission to the hospital. He had no history of diarrhea, dry mouth, polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, and gastrointestinal disease. The family history was noncontributory. His mother died of gynecological cancer at age 50. His father had no history of hyperglycemia or chronic abdominal pain, and the abdominal CT scan showed a normal pancreas. His only younger sister had no special medical history as well. A physical examination revealed that the patient was in good shape (body mass index 22.7 kg/m 2). He was conscious but dehydrated. He had a soft but tender abdomen, and his heart and lung functions were normal. His vital signs were also normal.

Laboratory tests (Table 1) revealed metabolic acidosis with an arterial blood pH of 7.3 and a base excess of − 8.9 mmol/L. The random plasma glucose level was 576 mg/dL, with urinalysis revealing glycosuria and ketonuria. The glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level was 147 mmol/mol, and the serum lactic acid level was within normal range. Levels of carcinoembryonic antigen and cancer antigen 199 were also within normal ranges. The results of liver function, serum amylase, lipase, C-reactive protein, and microalbuminuria tests, as well as the 24-h urine protein level, were within normal ranges. The patient was negative for the glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody, islet cell antibody, and insulin autoantibody. The patient was diagnosed with DKA and received standard treatment for the condition, which included intravenous fluids, insulin therapy, and potassium replacement.

### Current state of imaging of pediatric pancreatitis: expert panel narrative review [^113ebqsR]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2021). Medium credibility.

Pancreatitis is as common in children as it is in adults, though causes and accepted imaging strategies differ in children. In this narrative review we discuss the epidemiology of childhood pancreatitis and key imaging features for pediatric acute, acute recurrent, and chronic pancreatitis. We rely heavily on our collective experience in discussing advantages and disadvantages of different imaging modalities; practical tips for optimization of ultrasound, CT, and MRI with MRCP in children; and image interpretation pearls. Challenges and considerations unique to imaging pediatric pancreatitis are discussed, including timing of imaging, role of secretin-enhanced MRCP, utility of urgent MRI, severity prediction, autoimmune pancreatitis, and best methods for serial imaging. We suggest a methodical approach to pancreatic MRI interpretation in children and have included a sample structured report, and we provide consensus statements according to our experience imaging children with pancreatitis.

Table 2
Characteristics of the selected studies

Patients with ADP may also present with disorders of glucose metabolism, such as insulin-dependent diabetes, high-fasting blood glucose levels, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes. According to the published reports, approximately 50% of patients with ADP also have concomitant hyperglycemia. Although β-cell dysfunction is often indicative of hyperglycemia, there are only two studies reporting a correlation between ADP and DKA. Four cases of ADP, including the present one, had reported C-peptide test results, three of which showed low levels of fasting and postprandial C-peptide associated with β-cell dysfunction, and one case showed detectable C-peptide level of 0.47 nmol/L. Therefore, low insulin levels underlie most of the glucose metabolism disorders, as islets and β-cells are located in the tail of the pancreas. Previous studies have reported variations in the severity of high-fasting blood glucose disorders and insulin-dependent diabetes, indicating that there are many degrees of β-cell dysfunction in patients with ADP.

Other abdominal symptoms including pancreatitis and steatorrhea have also been reported. The reported incidence of pancreatitis was 30%, but it is unclear whether the high frequency of pancreatitis in ADP patient was due to the requirement of imaging procedure for patient with pancreatitis. Steatorrhea in ADP patient was due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Although the prevalence is much less common, most of the cases had concomitant hyperglycemia.

Imaging modalities are essential in the diagnosis of ADP, with ultrasonography as the most commonly used approach for evaluating abdominal pain and other abdominal symptoms. However, interference from the superimposed gas in the stomach and duodenum limits its usefulness in the detection of pancreatic anomalies. Both CT and MRCP are reliable modalities to confirm the absence of the body and tail of the pancreas and to differentiate this condition from other disorders such as periportal lymphadenopathy and anatomic variations. ERCP and MRCP can also be used to confirm the absence of the dorsal duct system. In summary, MRCP is a noninvasive approach with no risk of exposure to radiation, and we recommend it as the first choice for patients with ADP.

As glucose metabolism disorders can vary across different individuals, we advise clinicians to consider the diagnosis of ADP for a patient presenting with a glucose metabolism disorder accompanied by abdominal pain, pancreatitis or steatorrhea.

Informed consent was obtained from this patient for publication of this case history and associated images were provided.

Normal anatomy and variants — imaging selection for congenital pancreatic anomalies is outlined: Normal morphology of the pancreatic parenchyma to exclude entities such as dorsal pancreas agenesis or focal hypoplasia can be performed with transabdominal ultrasonography (TUS), while a more complete evaluation for coexistent syndrome abnormalities may require computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Annular pancreas can be difficult to detect by TUS; in infants it may be suggested by a "double bubble" on abdominal radiographs with duodenal narrowing on upper GI fluoroscopic examination, confirmation is usually obtained at surgery, and less severe forms are often discovered later by upper GI series or CT/MRI.

Case presentation

A 6 year old girl presented at a local hospital with an acute onset of abdominal pain, nausea and bilious vomiting. A history of constipation, recurrent vomiting associated with high fever in the preceding 12 months was elicited. Clinical examination was reported to be normal at the time. Complete blood counts revealed haemoglobin (Hb) 94 g/l, WBC 18.4 × 0 9 /l (Absolute PMN 15.6 × 10 9 /l, Lymph 2.0 × 10 9 /l) and platelets 663 × 10 9 /l. Her ESR was elevated at 54 mm/hr [1–15 mm/hr) and CRP 84 mg/l (< 10 mg/l). Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed diffuse, mesenteric lymphadenopathy. A barium meal with follow through suggested a small bowel obstruction. A laparotomy showed extensive intraperitoneal adhesions, mesenteric lymphadenopathy and a tight jejunal band with obstruction. The adhesions were divided, the obstruction was relieved and the patient's bowel function recovered steadily. Tissue cultures were negative. Histopathological analysis of the peritoneal tissue revealed fibro-fatty tissue with extensive fibrosis throughout, infiltrated by many scattered lymphocytes, plasma cells and occasional neutrophils but no malignant cells. The single lymph node examined revealed dilated sub-capsular sinuses with an expanded para-cortex with mixed histiocytes and occasional immunoblast with no granulomas, Reed Sternberg cells or any evidence of lymphoma. Ziehl-Neelsen stains were negative for tuberculosis organisms as was subsequent culture. The clinical condition improved slowly over the subsequent 2 weeks and she was discharged on oral iron supplements. No evidence of mono-clonality was seen on flow cytometry for immuno-phenotyping of lymph node tissue.

Three months later, she moved interstate and presented to the gastroenterology clinic at our hospital with continued weight loss and an exacerbation of abdominal pain and vomiting of fecal matter. Upper and lower endoscopies were normal. MRI of the abdomen revealed apparent thickening of a loop of proximal jejunum in the left mid abdomen with enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. CT scan revealed evidence of a subtle attenuation in the mesentery with diffuse lymphadenopathy (Figure 1A). The symptoms of obstruction settled with conservative management. At one month follow up, her haemoglobin remained depressed, 87 g/l, WBC 15.0 × 10 9 /l with thrombocytosis. She had lost 7 kgs in weight (from the first presentation), had recurrent abdominal pain and required a second admission for a partial obstruction which resolved with conservative management.

### Acute pancreatitis in children-morbidity and outcomes at 1 year [^116PDo8o]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Recurrent pancreatitis is a problem following the first diagnosis of AP. One third of children developed recurrent episode(s) within 1 year, which is comparable to the 28% reported in Italy, 33% in Canada and 36% in Mexico. However, it is higher than the 10% previously reported in Scotland, likely due to the significant change in the aetiological associations of AP in childhood, and also higher than the 17% reported from the United States.

Idiopathic (43%), hereditary factors (17%), medication (17%) and organic acidaemias (13%) are the the most common associations of acute recurrent pancreatitis, similar to findings in other studies. Some of the idiopathic cases may represent under-investigation for genetic or autoimmune causation. This study found relapse may follow both mild and moderate/severe initial AP episodes. However, the majority (83%) of patients who developed recurrence had mild first episodes. When combining both complications and recurrence, 50% (45/90) of the patients in this study developed either major complication(s) from the first episode and/or recurrent pancreatitis within a year from diagnosis. The high recurrence rate with AP observed in this study and several previous paediatric series suggests AP is not a benign disease, even if classified initially as mild.

Two patients died which indicates that AP has a case fatality of ~2.0% in the UK. This is less than the 5.3% and 6.3% reported in two earlier UK series. Case fatality figures correspond to the 2% reported by a Scottish report being in line with a review suggesting mortality is less than 5% in most cohorts. It is noticeably lower than the 10% reported in adults.

A study limitation was the possibility that diabetes in some cases was the result of a contemporaneous onset of autoimmune type 1 diabetes but data on antibody status was not collected in the survey. Reporting of this follow-up paper was delayed due to the lead researcher being caught up in civil conflict, but we believe the data interpretation is still robust. Patients were reported by paediatricians or paediatric surgeons who are members of BAPS. We believe that the vast majority of cases in those < 15 years will have been managed by these professionals. However, there may be a small proportion of patients who are managed solely by adult surgeons (or paediatric surgeons who are not members of BAPS) and would therefore be missed from reporting. Furthermore, a degree of under-reporting is likely with any voluntary surveillance system.

### Paediatric pancreatitis [^11175dwu]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to describe recent developments in paediatric pancreatitis and to discuss causes and current management.

Recent Findings

Although recent studies have estimated the annual incidence of paediatric acute pancreatitis approaching that of adults, there are no established guidelines about its diagnosis and treatment in children. Genetic and structural/congenital abnormalities are emerging as the primary risk factors for paediatric acute recurrent and chronic pancreatitis. Specifically, chronic pancreatitis is associated with a significant socioeconomic burden in children. Both medical and surgical therapies are proposed for paediatric chronic pancreatitis, but there is little evidence that they are beneficial.

Summary

Acute recurrent and chronic pancreatitis create significant health issues in the paediatric population. Medical and surgical therapies exist to potentially treat these conditions, but the paediatric data are limited and the cohorts are small. A multidisciplinary and multicentre approach is necessary to better determine pancreatic disease processes and treatment options in children.

Timing of imaging — few pediatric data exist, but adult data suggest that imaging within the first 48 hours of an attack of acute pancreatitis (AP) frequently underestimates management and poorly predicts the degree of organ failure; however, if imaging is necessary to make a diagnosis or to manage a patient, it should not be deferred; in suspected or known chronic pancreatitis (CP), imaging when the patient does not have superimposed AP is preferred to prevent obscuration of findings by acute inflammation.

### Perceptions of genetic testing in patients with hereditary chronic pancreatitis and their families: a qualitative triangulation [^115Ly5dK]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hereditary chronic pancreatitis (HCP) is a rare variety of chronic pancreatitis (CP) which is characterized by intermittent acute episodes of pancreatitis and long-term impairment of the exocrine and endocrine pancreatic functions due to loss of parenchymal tissue and formation of fibrosis. The term 'hereditary pancreatitis' is usually reserved for a category of the disease associated with germline mutations in the cationic (PRSS1) trypsinogen gene and distinguished from other varieties, which can also be associated with genetic risk factors but are not inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The latter are sometimes referred to as familial pancreatitis.

The clinical presentation can include recurrent abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, maldigestion, pseudocyst formation, and bile duct and duodenal obstruction. Currently, there is no causative treatment for HCP and therapy focuses, as in other forms of CP, on pain management, therapy for endocrine and exocrine insufficiency, and endoscopic or surgical interventions for complications. The course of the disease varies from asymptomatic to very severe forms.

As a rare genetic disorder, HCP is diagnosed predominantly in individuals of European origin. It was first described as a genetically determined disease in 1952 and later identified to be associated with mutations in the cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1) gene. It required extensive experimental research before it was discovered that the underlying mechanism involves the resistance of the disease-relevant, mutant trypsinogen isoforms against degradation by chymotrypsinogen C. However, despite comprehensive research, many unanswered questions regarding HCP remain and the identification of further mutations and the interplay of genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors are the focus of current studies.

CP, in itself, represents a psychological burden for the patients affected. Suffering from a genetic form of the disease carries an additional dimension for patients and their relatives. Currently, genetic testing by direct DNA sequencing is available for many diseases. It is widely discussed not only in biomedical research but also from sociological, psychological and ethical perspectives. The complexities of dealing with genetic test results, consequences of genetic knowledge, impacts on families, discrimination and stigmatization are the focus of the debates. Regarding families, topics such as prenatal testing, reproductive decisions, sharing of information within the family and attitudes regarding genetic testing have been discussed.

### Recommendations for diagnosis and management of autoimmune pancreatitis in childhood: consensus from INSPPIRE [^1179FsQN]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for pediatric pancreatitis, more specifically with respect to patients with autoimmune pancreatitis (clinical presentation), INSPPIRE 2018 guidelines recommend to recognize that autoimmune pancreatitis is a distinct subtype of pancreatitis in pediatric patients associated with pancreatic parenchymal changes, including lymphoplasmacytic and/or neutrophilic infiltrates and/or parenchymal fibrosis, and prompt clinical response to corticosteroids is a feature of the disease.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition and the society for pediatric radiology joint position paper on noninvasive imaging of pediatric pancreatitis: literature summary and recommendations [^114M1216]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). High credibility.

Imaging of pediatric chronic pancreatitis (CP) is used to establish diagnosis and guide management by identifying characteristic findings and complications, as the dominant role at diagnosis is to detect features that make the diagnosis of CP, and evaluation includes signs of acute inflammation, complications requiring intervention, and suspected masses. Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is an important differential for a pancreatic mass, is highly responsive to steroid therapy, and focal pancreatic enlargement should be differentiated from tumors because management differs. Imaging findings such as pancreatic atrophy help interpret biochemical markers and estimate risk of exocrine and endocrine dysfunction, while pancreatic calcifications — though a major feature in adult-focused criteria — appear less common in pediatrics. Characterization of biliary and pancreatic duct anatomy informs diagnostic and therapeutic decisions, and an irregular narrow main pancreatic duct with marked upstream dilation and smooth tapering of the common bile duct can be suggestive of AIP in the appropriate context. Imaging also plays a critical role in surgical planning, including use of lateral pancreaticojejunostomy for very dilated ducts with or without intraductal stones and consideration of pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic head pathologies.

### Recommendations for diagnosis and management of autoimmune pancreatitis in childhood: consensus from INSPPIRE [^114xFvWY]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for pediatric pancreatitis, more specifically with respect to patients with autoimmune pancreatitis (histopathology), INSPPIRE 2018 guidelines recommend to view acute and/or chronic inflammatory cell infiltration around pancreas acini or periductular and/or presence of IgG4-positive plasma cells with or without pancreas fibrosis as suggestive of pediatric autoimmune pancreatitis. Obtain a tissue diagnosis ideally before initiating treatment. Consider diagnosing pediatric autoimmune pancreatitis based on clinical and imaging findings if barriers to obtaining a histological diagnosis cannot be overcome.

### Trypsinogen mutations in pancreatic disorders [^114RoKHe]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

There are multiple PRSS1 mutations described in hereditary pancreatitis but only a minority of these are clinically relevant. The two most frequent point mutations are in exon 2 (N29I) and exon3 (R122H), found in diverse racial populations. Both mutations result in early onset pancreatitis but the mechanism underlying this phenotype is unclear. The frequency of these mutations in such diverse populations suggests they have spontaneously occurred many times. The origin of the major mutations may be explained by gene conversions, accounting for multiple founders. The implications are discussed in terms of mechanism of action of the mutations and clinical presentation.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). High credibility.

Pediatric pancreatitis — imaging strategy gaps and diagnostic limitations are highlighted as follows: Little information is available regarding the optimal imaging strategy for pediatric pancreatitis, and it is currently not possible to identify minimal change, or early chronic pancreatitis in pediatric patients.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^11542B3n]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for gastroparesis, more specifically with respect to gastric emptying studies, methodology, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to perform a 4-hour study in all cases, as some patients with normal emptying at 2 hours may be reclassified as delayed at 4 hours.

### Evaluation of acute abdominal pain in adults… [^1165DTYU]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Associated symptoms often allow the physician to further focus the differential diagnosis. For bowel obstruction, constipation is the symptom with the highest positive predictive value. For appendicitis, right lower quadrant pain has the highest positive predictive value, although migration from periumbilical to right lower quadrant pain and fever also suggest appendicitis. Some conditions that were historically considered useful in diagnosing abdominal pain have been found to have little predictive value. Symptoms in patients with abdominal pain that are suggestive of surgical or emergent conditions include fever, protracted vomiting, syncope or presyncope, and evidence of gastrointestinal blood loss. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The patient's general appearance and vital signs can help narrow the differential diagnosis. Patients with peritonitis tend to lie very still, whereas those with renal colic seem unable to stay still.

Fever suggests infection; however, its absence does not rule it out, especially in patients who are older or immunocompromised. Tachycardia and orthostatic hypotension suggest hypovolemia. The location of pain guides the remainder of the physical examination. Physicians should pay close attention to the cardiac and lung examinations in patients with upper abdominal pain because they could suggest pneumonia or cardiac ischemia. Older patients with abdominal pain present a particular diagnostic challenge. Disease frequency and severity may be exaggerated in this population. Presentation may differ in older patients, and poor patient recall or a reduction in symptom severity may cause misdiagnosis. There are several diseases that should be considered in all older patients with abdominal pain because of the increased incidence and high risk of morbidity and mortality in these patients.

Occult urinary tract infection, perforated viscus, and ischemic bowel disease are potentially fatal conditions commonly missed or diagnosed late in older patients. If urinary tract infection or nephrolithiasis is suspected, urinalysis is appropriate. Patients with colic, fever, steatorrhea, or a positive Murphy's sign should receive ultrasonography. The evaluation of right lower quadrant pain is guided by the patient's history. Patients with symptoms or signs suggestive of appendicitis should receive CT and urgent surgical consultation. Normal CT findings should trigger additional urine, colon, or pelvic examination.
