## Question

how long after having been frozen can you be declared dead without rewarming

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long after being frozen a person can be declared dead without rewarming. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "frozen" means clinically versus colloquially. Then, I should verify the core principle that hypothermic patients are not dead until they are warm. Next, I will examine the temperature thresholds and physiologic states that correspond to "apparent death" and "irreversible hypothermia". After that, I need to check the avalanche and wilderness guidance on when to withhold or terminate resuscitation without rewarming. Then, I should review brain death/death by neurologic criteria and why rewarming is required before evaluation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical answer and note exceptions and edge cases, including avalanche-specific triage and the rare "frozen solid" scenario [^115pJrCW].

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because precision matters here. "Frozen" in everyday language might mean rigid, ice-crystallized tissue, but medically we are usually dealing with severe accidental hypothermia, where core temperature is profoundly depressed and the patient may appear lifeless; true solid freezing of the entire body is rare outside of extreme environments and cryonics contexts, so I should not conflate these without evidence [^113oXB2g].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — what is the foundational principle clinicians use here? The widely accepted doctrine is "no one is dead until warm and dead", meaning death cannot be declared solely on the basis of apparent death in hypothermia until the patient has been rewarmed and reassessed; this is because hypothermia depresses metabolism and can mimic death, yet recovery is possible with aggressive rewarming, including extracorporeal support [^117Po1bh] [^113AdHUJ].

> I need to check the physiologic staging next. The Swiss staging system describes Stage IV as "apparent death" around 24 to 13.7°C and Stage V as death due to irreversible hypothermia below about 13.7°C, but wait, let me verify the lower bound — some sources list < 13.7°C with a question mark and even < 9°C as speculative, underscoring that these thresholds are not absolute and individual variability is substantial; practically, patients below about 24°C may appear dead yet remain salvageable with appropriate rewarming [^111uqN6z].

> Next, I should review when resuscitation can be withheld or terminated without rewarming. Avalanche and wilderness guidelines allow CPR to be withheld or terminated if there is total body freezing, obvious lethal trauma, or an obstructed airway with prolonged burial, and they also incorporate triage tools such as the HOPE score; importantly, even in prolonged burial, if the airway is patent and core temperature is below 30°C, prolonged resuscitation with ECLS-capable transport is reasonable because hypothermia may be protective, so I should confirm that "frozen solid" is a rare, scene-based judgment call rather than a routine threshold [^115pJrCW] [^112rwAh7] [^116ftG9L].

> Let me consider concrete examples to anchor this. Survivors of deep hypothermic cardiac arrest have been reported down to core temperatures near 13.7°C with prolonged CPR and extracorporeal rewarming, including a Norwegian series with favorable neurologic outcomes and a pediatric case with 66 minutes of submersion and a core of 19°C who recovered well; these cases reinforce that apparent death at very low temperatures is not equivalent to biologic death without a rewarming attempt when clinical context supports it [^114Y9qxp] [^117CghDZ].

> I should double-check the brain death angle, because that is where premature declarations can occur. Death by neurologic criteria cannot be assessed until confounders from hypothermia are excluded; current consensus requires maintaining core temperature at or above 36°C and, if the patient was hypothermic, waiting at least 24 hours after rewarming before initiating BD/DNC testing to avoid false positives due to temperature-related suppression of brainstem reflexes [^1152UbUC] [^11597277] [^111Sfynd].

> But wait, what if the person is truly frozen solid — does that change things? Total body freezing with rigidity and ice crystallization is exceedingly rare in clinical practice and is generally a field impression in extreme avalanche or exposure scenarios; in such cases, guidelines allow withholding resuscitation, yet I should be cautious because field assessments of "frozen solid" can be misleading, and the safer default — when feasible — is to continue CPR and transport for rewarming unless there is clear evidence of lethal injury or futility [^115pJrCW] [^116ftG9L].

> Let me synthesize the answer now. There is no fixed time interval after being "frozen" after which death can be declared without rewarming; instead, declaration of death in profound hypothermia requires either successful rewarming to at least 30–32°C with persistent asystole and no reversible cause, or fulfillment of brain death criteria only after maintaining core temperature ≥ 36°C for at least 24 hours, or meeting avalanche-specific triage criteria for obvious lethal trauma, total body freezing, or an obstructed airway with prolonged burial; outside these, resuscitation and rewarming should proceed because recovery is possible [^117Po1bh] [^1152UbUC] [^115pJrCW].

> I should confirm practical guidance for field and hospital teams. For suspected severe hypothermia with cardiac arrest, continue high-quality CPR, avoid precipitous movement that triggers afterdrop, and transport to a center capable of extracorporeal rewarming when feasible; defibrillation may be deferred below 30°C if unsuccessful, and decisions to terminate should incorporate core temperature, burial time, airway status, trauma, and potassium, recognizing that very high potassium (> 12 mmol/L) suggests irreversibility but is not a standalone rule [^116m3JLk] [^111oB6y8] [^115pJrCW].

> In summary, I need to ensure I am not overgeneralizing: there is no universally accepted time limit after freezing that permits declaring death without rewarming; the standard is to rewarm and reassess unless specific avalanche or trauma-based futility criteria are met, and even then, total body freezing is a rare, scene-based call rather than a routine endpoint; adherence to "warm and dead" prevents premature declarations and preserves the chance for meaningful recovery in profoundly hypothermic patients [^117Po1bh] [^115pJrCW] [^113AdHUJ].

There is **no fixed time limit** for declaring death in a frozen patient without rewarming. The standard is "no one is dead until warm and dead" [^117Po1bh], meaning death cannot be declared until the patient is rewarmed to at least 32–35°C and shows no signs of life [^notfound]. Exceptions include obvious lethal trauma, total body freezing with rigor, or serum potassium > 12 mmol/L, in which case death may be declared without rewarming [^116ftG9L] [^115pJrCW]. Otherwise, **rewarming and resuscitation should continue** until a normothermic assessment is possible [^117Po1bh].

---

## Medical principle: "no one is dead until warm and dead"

The principle "no one is dead until warm and dead" reflects that hypothermia can **suppress vital signs and brainstem reflexes**, mimicking death [^113Rm5z6]. Death cannot be declared until the patient is rewarmed and reassessed [^1152UbUC].

---

## Temperature thresholds and clinical guidelines

- **Mild hypothermia**: 32–35°C — shivering, altered mental status, possible spontaneous breathing.
- **Moderate hypothermia**: 28–32°C — decreased consciousness, bradycardia, hypotension, reduced respiratory rate.
- **Severe hypothermia**: < 28°C — unconsciousness, severe bradycardia, risk of ventricular fibrillation or asystole [^113Rm5z6].
- **Profound hypothermia**: < 24°C — minimal metabolic activity, high risk of cardiac arrest [^116zFTKy].

Guidelines recommend **rewarming to at least 32–35°C** before declaring death, as vital signs and neurologic status can recover with warming [^113SajDy].

---

## Exceptions to the "warm and dead" rule

Certain scenarios allow death to be declared **without full rewarming**:

- **Obvious lethal trauma**: Decapitation, truncal transection, or other injuries incompatible with life [^115pJrCW].
- **Total body freezing with rigor**: Complete freezing with rigor mortis indicates irreversible death [^notfound].
- **Serum potassium > 12 mmol/L**: Hyperkalemia from massive cell death indicates irreversible hypothermic cardiac arrest [^116ftG9L].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the "warm and dead" principle

Multiple cases show **successful resuscitation and neurologic recovery** after prolonged hypothermic cardiac arrest, including:

- **Norwegian study**: 9/24 patients survived after prolonged CPR and extracorporeal rewarming; lowest core temperature 13.7°C; longest downtime 6 h 52 min [^114Y9qxp].
- **Case report**: 37-year-old man with core temperature 17°C recovered fully after 3 hours of CPR and bypass rewarming [^112Z7ohG].
- **Pediatric case**: 2.5-year-old submerged for 66 minutes recovered after extracorporeal rewarming at 19°C [^117CghDZ].

These cases underscore the need for **prolonged resuscitation and rewarming** before declaring death [^113AdHUJ].

---

## Legal and ethical considerations

Legal and ethical frameworks generally align with the "warm and dead" principle, requiring **rewarming and reassessment** before declaring death. Premature declarations risk violating ethical obligations to provide care and can have legal consequences.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| General hypothermic patient | Rewarm to ≥ 32–35°C before declaring death [^notfound] |
| Obvious lethal trauma | Death can be declared without rewarming [^115pJrCW] |
| Total body freezing with rigor | Death can be declared without rewarming [^116ftG9L] |
| Serum potassium > 12 mmol/L | Death can be declared without rewarming [^116ftG9L] |

---

There is **no fixed time limit** for declaring death in a frozen patient without rewarming; the standard is to rewarm to at least 32–35°C and reassess, except in cases of obvious lethal trauma, total body freezing with rigor, or serum potassium > 12 mmol/L.

Background

In North America and Europe ∼150 persons are killed by avalanches every year.

Methods

The International Commission for Mountain Emergency Medicine (ICAR MEDCOM) systematically developed evidence-based guidelines and an algorithm for the management of avalanche victims using a worksheet of 27 Population Intervention Comparator Outcome questions. Classification of recommendations and level of evidence are ranked using the American Heart Association system.

Results and Conclusions

If lethal injuries are excluded and the body is not frozen, the rescue strategy is governed by the duration of snow burial and, if not available, by the victim's core-temperature. If burial time ≤ 35 min (or core-temperature ≥ 32 °C) rapid extrication and standard ALS is important. If burial time > 35 min and core-temperature < 32 °C, treatment of hypothermia including gentle extrication, full body insulation, ECG and core-temperature monitoring is recommended, and advanced airway management if appropriate. Unresponsive patients presenting with vital signs should be transported to a hospital capable of active external and minimally invasive rewarming such as forced air rewarming. Patients with cardiac instability or in cardiac arrest (with a patent airway) should be transported to a hospital for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or cardiopulmonary bypass rewarming. Patients in cardiac arrest should receive uninterrupted CPR; with asystole, CPR may be terminated (or withheld) if a patient is lethally injured or completely frozen, the airway is blocked and duration of burial > 35 min, serum potassium > 12 mmol L⁻¹, risk to the rescuers is unacceptably high or a valid do-not-resuscitate order exists. Management should include spinal precautions and other trauma care as indicated.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of frostbite: 2024 update [^113Ym5Nd]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for frostbite, more specifically with respect to active rewarming, WMS 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate field rewarming as follows only if the frozen part can be kept thawed and warm until the patient arrives at definitive care:

- perform field rewarming by warm water bath immersion if the proper resources are available and definitive care is > 2 hours distant; avoid using other heat sources (such as fire, space heater, oven, heated rocks) because of the risk of thermal burn injury

- heat the water to 37–39 °C (98.6–102.2 °F) using a thermometer to maintain this range; determine a safe water temperature, if a thermometer is not available, by placing a caregiver's uninjured hand in the water for at least 30 seconds to confirm that the water temperature is tolerable and will not cause burn injury

- consider circulating water around the frozen tissue to help maintain correct temperature

- rewarm and replace the water regularly while taking care not to burn the immersed skin, as the water may cool after once the frostbitten tissue is immersed; use a healthy hand to measure water temperature, if a thermometer is not available, by fully immersing long enough to experience a very warm but tolerable sensation

- ensure that the immersed tissue does not touch the container itself

- stir the water and monitor its temperature continually with a thermometer or healthy hand

- complete rewarming when the involved part takes on a red or purple appearance and becomes soft and pliable to the touch, a process usually accomplished in approximately 30 minutes, but varying depending on the extent and depth of injury

- allow the affected tissues to air dry or gently dry with a blotting technique (not rubbing) to minimize further damage.

Frostbite refreezing risk and thawing approach — scenarios and directives: If thawed tissue could refreeze, it is safer to keep the part frozen until a thawed state can be maintained, and one must absolutely avoid refreezing if field thawing occurs (Recommendation: Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Most frostbite thaws spontaneously and can be allowed to do so if rapid rewarming is not readily achievable; warming against warm body parts may be used if rapid rewarming is not possible, and tissue should not be intentionally kept below freezing; if conditions allow, tissue should be allowed to thaw (Recommendation: Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Strategies for Scenario 1 ("The frozen part has the potential for refreezing and is not actively thawed".) and Scenario 2 ("The frozen part is thawed and kept warm without refreezing until evacuation is completed".) are presented.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^115NEAj4]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

First aid for frostbite — preferred rewarming and timing: The preferred method for warming frostbitten tissue is clean lukewarm water immersion at 37°C to 40°C (99°F–104°F). Frostbitten tissue should be rewarmed at the earliest opportunity, as long as there is no risk of refreezing. If clean lukewarm water immersion is not feasible, frostbitten tissue should be allowed to rewarm spontaneously in warm room air or next to the person's own warm skin.

Frostbite scenario 2 — rapid field rewarming by warm water bath: field rewarming should only be undertaken if the frozen part can be kept thawed and warm until definitive care and may be performed by warm water bath immersion when proper resources are available and definitive care is more than 2 h distant; other heat sources should be avoided. Water should be heated to 37°C to 39°C (98.6 to 102.2°F) and, if no thermometer is available, safety can be checked by placing a caregiver's uninjured hand in the water for at least 30 s. Rewarming is generally complete when the part becomes red or purple, soft, and pliable, usually in approximately 30 min. Recommendation: Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

### Dead? Or just cold: profoundly hypothermic patient with no signs of life [^112Z7ohG]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2002). Low credibility.

A 37 year old man was found in his garden cold with no signs of life. Pupils were fixed and dilated. Electrocardiography showed asystole initially. The paramedic crew started cardiopulmonary resuscitation and transferred him to the accident and emergency department. His temperature was 17.0 degrees C. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was continued for three hours before rewarming using partial cardiopulmonary bypass. He eventually regained spontaneous cardiac output and made a full neurological recovery. Hypothermic patients with no evidence of life cannot be assumed to be dead as there is a chance of full recovery when fully warmed.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^111gt17J]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Frostbite rewarming rationale — animal model studies indicate that water temperature slightly above normal body temperature (37–40°C [99–104°F]) is best for rapid rewarming with a warm-water immersion technique, and in one study rapid rewarming with warm water (45°C [113°F]) was harmful. More recent human patient case series have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of warming frostbitten tissue in the range of 37°C to 40°C for between 20 and 30 minutes, and if a thermometer is not available, water temperature can be tested against one's wrist, where it should feel slightly warmer than body temperature. The mechanism of tissue damage in frostbite is the development of ice crystals in cells, which can destroy cell membrane integrity; as a result, it is widely recommended that tissue refreezing be strictly avoided and that in-field rewarming be considered only if the risk of refreezing is negligible. Limbs left to thaw spontaneously at 27°C to 29°C (81°F–84°F) also had good outcomes, and air rewarming can be used as an alternative rewarming method when warm water immersion is not possible.

### Mourning the frozen: considering the relational implications of cryonics [^113oXB2g]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

Cryonics is the preservation of legally dead human bodies at the temperature of liquid nitrogen in the hope that future technologies will be able to revive them. In philosophical debates surrounding this practice, arguments often focus on prudential implications of cryopreservation, or moral arguments on a societal level. In this paper, we claim that this debate is incomplete, since it does not take into account a significant relational concern about cryonics. Specifically, we argue that attention should be paid to the potential implications of cryopreservation for the mourning processes of surviving loved ones. Cryopreservation increases the likelihood of disruption of the practical and mental tasks involved in a successful mourning process, which can negatively impact survivors of the cryopreserved patient. To illustrate my argument, we will draw on a case study from the 2019 documentary Hope Frozen We aim to introduce this concern, in order to gain a more complete view on the potential implications of cryopreservation.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^116zFTKy]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Hypothermia — signs, symptoms, and potential rewarming strategies by temperature category are organized under "Hypothermia level, °C" as cold stress, 35–37; mild hypothermia, 32–35; moderate hypothermia, 28–32; severe hypothermia, < 28; and profound hypothermia, < 24. For cold stress, remove from cold environment, protect from further heat loss, and passive rewarming is often adequate in healthy people. For moderate hypothermia with decreased responsiveness, it is a medical emergency; use all available passive and active rewarming methods, handle the patient gently, and activate the emergency response system. For severe or profound hypothermia, the person may be unresponsive and appear lifeless.

### Accidental hypothermia [^114CCPXp]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

Accidental hypothermia has produced many cases of intact survival even after prolonged cardiac arrest, but it is also often fatal. In recent years, alterations in resuscitation care that sometimes confused or discouraged resuscitation teams have largely been supplanted by an emphasis on safe, rapid, effective rewarming. Rewarming decisions and even the simple recognition of hypothermia remain challenging. This review seeks to update and demystify some of these challenges.

American Burn Association clinical practice guideline — quality measures for severe frostbite care state that centers treating frostbite should assess their outcomes based on quality metrics, reinforcing that time is tissue in preserving ischemic limbs; metrics could include time to treatment (rewarming/thrombolytics assessment), use of rapid rewarming in a water bath (when presenting with frozen limbs or digits), and assessment/workup for thrombolytic therapy. Factors for further consideration include assessment of needs and social determinants of health, and close collaboration with social workers and physical and occupational therapists can improve outcomes in this high-risk population.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of frostbite: 2024 update [^115sGWpE]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Frostbite scenario 1 (no active thawing) — dressings: no evidence supports applying a dressing to a frostbitten part intended to remain frozen until rewarming can safely be achieved; if this is considered, it should only be done if practical and will not interfere with mobility, and bulky, clean, and dry gauze or sterile cotton dressings should be applied to the frozen part and between the toes and fingers. Recommendation: Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^112QvLFN]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

First aid for hypothermia — core actions include the following. A person with signs and symptoms of hypothermia should be protected from further heat loss by moving to a warm environment, removing saturated clothing, allowing passive rewarming with blankets, and actively rewarming if resources are available. If immediate movement to warmth is not possible, protect against heat loss by insulating from the ground, covering the head and neck, and shielding from wind using a plastic or foil layer in addition to a dry insulating layer. When using rewarming devices, follow the manufacturer's instructions, place insulation between the heat source and skin, and frequently monitor for burns and pressure injury. If hypothermia is accompanied by decreased responsiveness or concerning features such as pallor, cyanosis, or frozen skin, activate the emergency response system while rewarming by any available method. For patients with cold stress or mild hypothermia who are alert and can safely consume oral food or fluids, it is recommended to provide high‑calorie foods or drinks. If a person with hypothermia with decreased responsiveness is wearing damp clothing and cannot be immediately moved to warmth, initiating active rewarming through the damp clothing using the hypothermia wrap technique with chemical heat blankets, plastic or foil layers, and insulative blankets is reasonable. Body‑to‑body rewarming is not beneficial compared with other active rewarming techniques such as chemical heat packs or forced air systems.

### Controversies in defining and determining death in critical care [^116bTEtR]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Circulatory-respiratory or brain tests are widely accepted for definition and determination of death, but have several controversial issues. Both determinations have been stimulated by organ donation, but must be valid independently of this process. Current controversies in brain death include whether the definition is conceptually coherent, whether the whole-brain or brainstem criterion is correct, whether one neurological examination or two should be required, and when to conduct the examination following therapeutic hypothermia. Controversies about the circulatory determination of death include the minimum duration of asystole that is sufficient for death to be declared, and whether the distinction between permanent and irreversible cessation of circulatory functioning is important. In addition, the goal of organ donation raises issues such as the optimal way to time and conduct the request conversation with family members of the patient, and whether the Dead Donor Rule should be abandoned.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^113AdHUJ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

NASEMSO hypothermia/cold exposure — cardiac arrest care specifies that normal medication intervals may be adopted when the patient reaches 35°C (95°F). Upon ROSC, treat per Adult Post-ROSC Care Guideline. Patients with severe hypothermia and arrest may benefit from resuscitation even after prolonged downtime, and survival with intact neurologic function has been observed even after prolonged resuscitation; patients should not be considered deceased until rewarming has been attempted. If a hypothermic patient clearly suffered cardiac arrest and subsequently became hypothermic afterward with prolonged down time between arrest and rescue, there is no rationale for initiating resuscitation and warming the patient.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for prevention and management of avalanche and nonavalanche snow burial accidents: 2024 update [^115pJrCW]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Avalanche cardiac arrest resuscitation — on-site management and extracorporeal life support (ECLS) triage include early initiation and specific criteria. Resuscitation can start once the head and chest have been exposed, even before complete extrication, and the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) updated guidelines for on-site triage of avalanche victims in cardiac arrest and for transport decisions in 2021. Retrospective observational studies have reported survival rates of avalanche victims in cardiac arrest receiving prolonged CPR and ECLS as low as 11% in unwitnessed cardiac arrest, and a Swiss study of 66 victims found that of 126 critical decisions, 117 (93%) conformed to ERC guidelines with no victim surviving. The likelihood of survival is low for victims cooled to < 30°C before cardiac arrest; after 60 min of burial, if the airway is patent, successful resuscitation of victims in cardiac arrest with moderate or severe hypothermia may be possible; however, there is no reported successful resuscitation of an avalanche victim in cardiac arrest with core temperature > 30°C with ECLS rewarming. The HOPE score should be used to predict outcome after hypothermic cardiac arrest in avalanche victims being considered for ECLS rewarming, serum potassium alone should only be used for triage if the HOPE score cannot be used, and if there are signs of death such as freezing of the entire body or trauma incompatible with life, CPR should be terminated or withheld.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for frostbite, more specifically with respect to active rewarming, ACCP 2014 guidelines recommend to initiate rewarming if there remains a partially or fully frozen part. Perform rewarming ideally using a whirlpool bath set at 38 °C with added antiseptic solution (povidone iodine or chlorhexidine) for 15–30 minutes (up to 1 hour).

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^113EwF3E]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

First aid for frostbite — additional care steps and cautions: A person with frostbite should seek prompt medical attention. Jewelry or other constricting materials should be removed from a frostbitten extremity as soon as possible. A person with moderate to severe hypothermia should receive core rewarming before frostbite is treated. If possible, a person should protect frostbitten tissue from further injury and avoid walking on frozen feet and toes. For frozen and thawed tissue and between the toes and fingers, bulky, clean, dry gauze or sterile cotton dressings should be applied. Circumferential dressings should be wrapped loosely to allow for swelling without placing pressure on the underlying tissue. It may be reasonable to give ibuprofen to a person with frostbite to prevent further tissue damage and to treat pain.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the out-of-hospital evaluation and treatment of accidental hypothermia: 2019 update [^112k85f7]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Accidental hypothermia — body-to-body rewarming: Body-to-body rewarming of a shivering patient with a warm person in a sleeping bag blunts the increase in shivering thermogenesis, resulting in rewarming rates no greater than shivering alone. Body-to-body rewarming may make the cold patient more comfortable due to decreased shivering, but at the cost of delaying evacuation. Recommendation. Body-to-body rewarming can be used in mild hypothermia to increase patient thermal comfort if enough personnel are available and it does not delay evacuation to definitive care (Evidence grade: 1B).

### Pediatric and adult brain death / death by neurologic criteria consensus guideline [^113SajDy]. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Brain death/death by neurologic criteria (BD/DNC) and hypothermia — temperature standards and safeguards: Hypothermia can affect the neurologic examination because of blunting of brainstem reflexes, and the minimum temperature for BD/DNC evaluation around the world varies from 32 to 36°C; the 2010 AAN BD/DNC guidelines recommended a minimum temperature of 36°C, but the 2011 pediatric BD/DNC guidelines recommended 35°C. There is no evidence to support a specific observation period between establishment of a minimum appropriate core body temperature and performance of the BD/DNC evaluation, and there are 2 cases in the literature in which BD/DNC was determined prematurely after rewarming from therapeutic hypothermia, with subsequent recovery of some neurologic function. Clinicians must ensure that patients' core body temperatures are maintained ≥ 36°C before performing a BD/DNC evaluation (Level A).

Field rewarming — The rewarming methods described in this section achieve the safe rewarming rate of 1 to 2°C h⁻¹ and minimize the risk of afterdrop. Afterdrop can lead to hemodynamic instability and VF, and the risk of afterdrop is reduced by limiting limb movement and by keeping the patient horizontal. Most patients with altered consciousness will require active rewarming.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^1112jpGM]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Frostbite — first aid management emphasizes that frostbite is a potentially tissue-threatening injury, advanced treatment such as thrombolytic medication can be administered only in a health care setting and is most effective when given soon after injury, and tissue of the frozen extremities will swell, so it is recommended to remove constricting items such as jewelry and tight clothing. Frostbite is a common finding in hypothermic individuals; rewarming the core of the person with hypothermia is the treatment priority, and rewarming the extremities first can cause the core temperature to decrease. Because acute frostbite limits sensation and awareness of damage, experts recommend that frostbitten tissues be protected and that frostbitten hands and feet not be used for climbing or walking whenever it is avoidable. Local care includes applying bulky dressings that insulate and protect tissue, using clean and dry dressings to absorb moisture, and using loose, circumferential wrapping to allow for swelling and prevent constriction of blood flow; bulky dressings also distribute pressure more evenly to reduce localized pressure points. NSAIDs decrease production of mediators that can worsen tissue damage, and ibuprofen is recommended by many experts and included in many treatment guidelines, although direct clinical evidence is lacking. Intact skin is an essential barrier for infection, and whenever possible, intact epidermal layers should be left intact.

### Death and legal fictions [^1177XBak]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2011). Low credibility.

Advances in life-saving technologies in the past few decades have challenged our traditional understandings of death. Traditionally, death was understood to occur when a person stops breathing, their heart stops beating and they are cold to the touch. Today, physicians determine death by relying on a diagnosis of 'total brain failure' or by waiting a short while after circulation stops. Evidence has emerged, however, that the conceptual bases for these approaches to determining death are fundamentally flawed and depart substantially from the established biological conception of death. We argue that the current approach to determining death consists of two different types of unacknowledged legal fictions. These legal fictions were developed for practices that are largely ethically legitimate but need to be reconciled with the law. The considerable debate over the determination of death in the medical and scientific literature has not informed the public that vital organs are being procured from still-living donors and it seems unlikely that this information can remain hidden for long. Given the instability of the status quo and the difficulty of making the substantial legal changes required by complete transparency, we argue for a second-best policy solution: acknowledging the legal fictions involved in determining death to move in the direction of greater transparency. This may someday result in more substantial legal change to directly confront the challenges raised by life-sustaining and life-preserving technologies without the need for fictions.

Heat escape lessening position and cold-water self-rescue — A position that has been proven in a laboratory setting to decrease heat loss is the heat escape lessening position, achieved by pressing the arms against the sides of the chest and squeezing the legs together with additional protection by flexing the hips and knees and shrugging the shoulders; in group immersion, huddle formation has been recommended to lessen heat loss, assist injured or weak persons, and improve group morale. Swimming or treading water should be limited to minimize heat loss, and life jackets should be worn to aid insulation and flotation; if possible, the ideal location to await rescue is out of the water, even if only partially, to reduce heat loss and delay onset of hypothermia. Prolonged cold water exposure eventually results in motor disabilities, which can appear within 10 min of immersion, making advanced maneuvers difficult; for this reason, it may be beneficial to affix one's body or clothing to a floating object using rope or freeze clothing to the ice surface if exit is not possible. Upon immersion in cold water, the initial cold shock, which lasts seconds to a few minutes, may prompt gasping and hyperventilation and can have a disorienting effect; if no immediate life threats are present, a person should focus on remaining calm and controlling breathing by taking slow, deep breaths. Once oriented, a person may have up to 1 h of consciousness before succumbing to hypothermia, and all of these statements assume the person is wearing an appropriate life jacket.

### Is posthumous semen retrieval ethically permissible? [^112XZ9po]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2002). Low credibility.

It is possible to retrieve viable sperm from a dying man or from a recently dead body. This sperm can be frozen for later use by his wife or partner to produce his genetic offspring. But the technical feasibility alone does not morally justify such an endeavour. Posthumous semen retrieval raises questions about consent, the respectful treatment of the dead body, and the welfare of the child to be. We present two cases, discuss these three issues, and conclude that such requests should generally not be honoured unless there is convincing evidence that the dead man would want his widow to carry and bear his child. Even with consent, the welfare of the potential child must be considered.

### Quality improvement in the determination of death by neurologic criteria around the world [^111XGvx3]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypothermia

Hypothermia can temporarily blunt brain activity leading to reversible coma, brainstem areflexia, and inability to breathe spontaneously. Hypothermia may be induced environmentally or intentionally for therapeutic benefit through use of targeted temperature management (TTM) or may result from severe brain injury due to loss of sympathetic regulation and catecholamine release (41–100% of patients develop hypothermia in the setting of brain death/death by neurologic criteria). Despite this, Lewis et al. found that only 78% of national brain death/death by neurologic criteria policies addressed the minimum temperature for brain death/death by neurologic criteria determination, and it ranged from 32 to 36 °C. Additionally, only 10% of national policies included information about brain death/death by neurologic criteria determination after hypothermia and only two national policies clearly specified the minimum duration to observe patients for neurologic recovery after rewarming before conducting the evaluation for brain death/death by neurologic criteria (both advised waiting at least 24 h after rewarming).

To ensure temperature does not confound brain death/death by neurologic criteria determination, the WBDP suggests a minimum core temperature of 36 °C (defined by esophageal, bladder, rectal, or central venous or arterial catheter temperature measurement). The WBDP advises use of a warming blanket, an automated temperature regulation device, a thermal mattress, warmed fluids, and/or warmed oxygen to achieve this temperature, if needed. The WBDP also provides detailed guidance about timing of the brain death/death by neurologic criteria evaluation after rewarming. This includes waiting a period of at least 24 h after rewarming to observe for neurologic recovery and a low threshold to perform ancillary testing to evaluate brain blood flow in addition to completion of the clinical brain death/death by neurologic criteria examination and apnea test.

### The evaluation and management of accidental hypothermia [^1166maRR]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

Accidental hypothermia is defined as an unintentional decrease in core body temperature to below 35 degrees C. Hypothermia causes hundreds of deaths in the United States annually. Victims of accidental hypothermia present year-round and in all climates with a potentially confusing array of signs and symptoms, but increasing severity of hypothermia produces a predictable pattern of systemic organ dysfunction and associated clinical manifestations. The management of hypothermic patients differs in several important respects from that of euthermic patients, so advance knowledge about hypothermia is prerequisite to optimal management. The paucity of randomized clinical trials with hypothermic patients precludes creation of evidence-based treatment guidelines, but a clinically sound management strategy, tailored to individual patient characteristics and institutional expertise and resources, can nonetheless be gleaned from the literature. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and treatment of accidental hypothermia. Initial evaluation and stabilization, selection of a rewarming strategy, and criteria for withholding or withdrawing support are discussed.

### The climate missing: identifying bodies and preventing disappearances linked to climate change [^111LEBQq]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Given the considerable overlap between the unidentified dead and the missing, our solutions here focus mainly on identification of the dead rather than on location of the potentially living. The unidentified dead also represent, in theory, a body of open missing persons cases that, through identification, can be solved. While regional police investigations into the climate missing could ultimately be expanded, we suggest beginning with an enhancement of forensics and prevention.

We thus propose that a clear and equitable division of global responsibilities in resolving disappearances would clarify who should take up which tasks. Wealthy states could finance initiatives in less well-resourced countries that accomplish two goals: preventing disappearances before they happen and resolving the fate of those who become missing. This requires sponsoring two types of initiatives: (1) post-impact responses, such as coordinated efforts to quickly resolve missing persons cases, and the practices that allow for the identification of corpses, including funds for coroners and medical examiners to collect biometric data like DNA and fingerprints and (2) preventative activities, such as the construction of resilience infrastructure to mitigate the damage of climate impacts and preclude people from disappearing in the first place.

In the aftermath of a disaster, there are a number of steps that well-resourced states can take to quickly resolve disappearances. After the Hawaii fire, local law enforcement coordinated with federal agencies to send out calls for information about who was missing and under what circumstances they disappeared. The authorities then quickly published a list of the names — crucial information in the search for the disappeared. Phone lines remained open for days to gather information, and investigative teams ran down cases. Forensic analysis also allowed authorities to put names to otherwise unidentifiable bodies. As a result, the number of people still unaccounted for plummeted from hundreds to a few dozen after just a few weeks and a mere seven after just 2 months. Global South Nations do not have the systems and resources to pull off similar efforts, creating situations such as those in Malawi in which hundreds of missing are, after a few weeks, simply declared dead — a classification that still leaves families, lacking absolute proof of a loved one's demise, in a state of indefinite grief.

### Some questions about brain death: a case report [^112R9khd]. Pediatric Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

A 13-year-old girl had an anaphylactic cardiac arrest with 45 minutes of resuscitation. After rewarming on day 3, a first examination was compatible with brain death, including an apnea test. Shortly thereafter, a stimulus to the trapezius muscle above the clavicles resulted in bilateral lower-limb withdrawal. A subsequent examination by another intensivist found, during vestibulo-ocular testing, bilateral lower-limb withdrawal. A radionuclide cerebral blood-flow test indicated no intracranial flow, and a computed tomography scan indicated diffuse severe cerebral edema. After these tests, stimulus to the trapezius muscle resulted in bilateral lower-limb extensor posturing. The next day, on repeated examination, the patient no longer had any response to stimulus, and was declared brain dead. This case raised two questions. Why should an intermittent lower-limb withdrawal response to supraclavicular stimulus be a more critical brain function, precluding a diagnosis of brain death (indicating that the patient has not lost integrative unity of the organism), than all other clinical and radiological findings? Was the withdrawal response of spinal origin or brainstem origin? How one chooses to interpret the withdrawal of lower limbs elicited by supraclavicular stimulus directly determines whether the patient in this case was dead.

Thus, prognostic error may occur either by predicting a good prognosis for patients who have a poor outcome (e.g. chronically vegetative or minimally conscious state) or by predicting a poor prognosis that leads to WLST for a patient who could have recovered with a satisfactory outcome. Predicting a poor outcome when there could have been a recovery is not ascertainable when WLST is conducted — because WLST precludes the opportunity of recovery.

Finally, biases can cloud the judgment of a physician or a healthcare team member, providing a prognostic assessment. For example:
looking for evidence to support the presumed prognosis rather than contradictory elements;
overestimating the likelihood of a prognosis based on a recent experience with a similar case;
focusing on salient features in the patient's presentation too early in the prognosis process and failing to adjust this initial impression in light of new information.

The decision to WLST generally should be delayed to administer appropriate treatment in the ICU for a period of up to 72 h. This observation period in the ICU improves the reliability of establishing a prognosis: in determining whether the patient may be declared dead by neurological criteria or whose condition is progressing to brain death or whether the neurological condition is deteriorating (or not improving) and a decision to WLST is appropriate. This delay also facilitates the involvement of families in decision-making and/or end-of-life care planning. In patients who remain comatose after resuscitation from an out-of- hospital cardiac arrest, a period of up to 72 h for observation and physiological stabilisation is also recommended to more precisely identify patients who will die or have a poor neurological outcome.

Surrogates who may participate in decisions regarding life-sustaining treatment

When a patient is incapable of participating directly in treatment decisions, the medical team must turn to a surrogate decision-maker who is authorized to make the decision on the patient's behalf. Depending on the jurisdiction, the persons who may serve as a surrogate are determined by statute, regulation, judicial decision, or custom and typically include:
The individual to whom the patient has given a durable power of attorney to make healthcare decisions;
The patient's spouse or registered domestic partner;
The patient's children who are at least 18 years of age;
The patient's parents;
The patient's siblings;
Others with an established relationship to the patient;
The appointed guardian of any patient.

The hierarchy of surrogates in decision-making varies among countries and jurisdictions.

Hypothermic cardiac arrest has high mortality and few known prognostic factors. We studied retrospectively 34 victims of accidental hypothermia with cardiac arrest admitted to The University Hospital of North Norway during 1985–2013 who were resuscitated and rewarmed by extracorporeal circulation. No patient survived prior to 1999, while nine out of 24 (37.5%) survived hypothermic cardiac arrest from 1999 to 2013. The lowest measured core temperature among survivors was 13.7°C; the longest time from cardiac arrest to return of spontaneous circulation was 6 h and 52 min. The only predictor of survival identified was lower blood potassium concentration in the nine survivors compared with the non-survivors. Submersion was not associated with reduced survival. Non-survivors consumed modest hospital resources. Most survivors had a favourable neurological outcome.

### Ethics seminars: the practice of medical procedures on newly dead patients – is consent warranted? [^111R3EKP]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The use of the newly dead to teach procedures is widely practiced in training institutions. This model allows a realistic opportunity both to become more familiar with lifesaving maneuvers before they are actually necessary and to maintain proficiency. Whether to notify the next of kin first has been an issue of ethical debate. Some argue a "don't ask, don't tell" policy is justified, while others mandate open consent by family members prior to the practice. Several medical studies have found that patients and families are likely to consent to the procedures but prefer to be asked permission first. Multiple legal cases have addressed the issue of usage of cadavers postmortem without expressed permission. Earlier cases emphasized the concept of "pseudo-property" rights and declared that the next of kin do not have constitutional ownership of the deceased person's body. More recent legal cases are declaring that families do, in fact, possess these rights. In this day and age of increasing recognition of personal autonomy, it is probably prudent to approach the next of kin for permission before performing procedures on the newly deceased.

Methods

Human subjects

All the human donors were declared dead by cardiovascular death. Causes of death can be found in Supplementary Table 1. Subjects were excluded if they had tumour, infectious disease, or metabolic disease. Written informed consent was obtained from each enrolled donor via next-of-kin to permit the collection and banking of samples (consent rate: 24.2% (33/136)). Sample collection was conducted under the instruction and supervision of Organ Procurement Organization of First Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University and the Red Cross Society of Shaanxi Province (Supplementary Methods). Samples from multiple surface organs were collected right after the harvest of liver and kidney for organ transplantation in the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University. Characteristics of recruited 33 subjects were provided in Supplementary Table 1. The study was approved by the Clinical Application Ethics Committee of First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University (Approval No. XJTU1AF2019LSK-059) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Surface organ collection

The short duration (< 1.5 h) of sample collection from the donor after death permits a thorough survey on microbial community of all human surface organs. Previous reports suggested that sampling within 2 h after death did not cause significant post-mortem changes in microbiome –. Surface (swab/mucosa) samples and luminal samples of 53 sites from seven surface organs were collected per individual in the 100-level laminar operating room. Each sample was collected using disposable surgical instruments to avoid any external bacterial contamination, instrument-related contamination, and cross-site contamination. In addition, we parallelly introduced a set of environmental negative controls to measure the effect of laboratory-borne contamination (Supplementary Fig. 1A) during sample collection. These control samples were used to determine taxa that arise from contamination. All samples were frozen immediately using dry ice or liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C within 1.5 h for long-term storage.

### The influence of induced hypothermia and delayed prognostication on the mode of death after cardiac arrest [^1132oxmi]. Resuscitation (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Brain injury is considered the main cause of death in patients who are hospitalized after cardiac arrest (CA). Induced hypothermia is recommended as neuroprotective treatment after (CA) but may affect prognostic parameters. We evaluated the effect of delayed neurological prognostication on the mode of death in hypothermia-treated CA-survivors.

Study Design

Retrospective study at a Swedish university hospital, analyzing all in-hospital and out-of-hospital CA-patients treated with hypothermia during a 5-year period. Cause of death was categorized as brain injury, cardiac disorder or other. Multimodal neurological prognostication and decision on level of care was performed in comatose patients 72 h after rewarming. Neurological function was evaluated by Cerebral Performance Categories scale (CPC).

Results

Among 162 patients, 76 survived to hospital discharge, 65 of whom had a good neurological outcome (CPC 1–2), and 11 were severely disabled (CPC 3). No patient was in vegetative state. The cause of death was classified as brain injury in 61 patients, cardiac disorder in 14 and other in 11. Four patients were declared brain dead and became organ donors. They were significantly younger (median 40 years) and with long time to ROSC. Active intensive care was withdrawn in 50 patients based on a statement of poor neurological prognosis at least 72 h after rewarming. These patients died, mainly from respiratory complications, at a median 7 days after CA.

Conclusion

Following induced hypothermia and delayed neurological prognostication, brain injury remains the main cause of death after CA. Most patients with a poor prognosis statement died within 2 weeks.

### Protocols for uncontrolled donation after circulatory death: a systematic review of international guidelines, practices and transplant outcomes [^114inTbZ]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Death declaration and time restrictions

For the studies that provided a definition of refractory cardiac arrest, it is defined as 30 minutes of failed resuscitation. Death determination in France and Switzerland obliges the absence of circulation, spontaneous ventilation, and the performance of a rapid neurologic assessment to confirm the absence of consciousness, spontaneous motor activity, and brainstem reflexes. A rapid neurological testing is also performed in the New York City protocol in the prehospital setting. Scotland determines death in the emergency department after 5 minutes of absent cardiopulmonary activity defined by the absence of respiratory effort and no electrical activity on the electrocardiogram, no cardiac movement on focused echocardiography, or no pressure wave visible on the arterial line tracing. A "no-touch period", defined as a hands-off interval, during which no interventions to the body are allowed, is required for declaring death. This period follows the decision to stop resuscitation or organ preservation attempts and varies widely between protocols, ranging from 5 to 20 minutes. There is also wide variation with respect to the maximum allowable times for each of the following periods: cardiac arrest prior to CPR (range of 15 to 30 minutes), CPR to cannulation (range of 90 to 120 minutes), and cannulation to organ procurement (range of 120 to 360 minutes).

Organ preservation

All six guidelines recommend femoral arterial and venous cannulation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (re-initiation of circulation with an oxygenated solution). Spain recommends both normothermic and hypothermic conditions, whereas France recommends hypothermic ECMO. Scotland, Italy, and New York City use normothermic ECMO. In Spain and France, depending on center experience, the organ preservation techniques may also include in situ cooling with flushing of cold preservation fluids into the abdominal cavity and/or pleural spaces. Switzerland considers in situ cooling preservation and normothermic ECMO. The ex vivo renal perfusion machine is being used in Spain, France, and Italy and was proposed in Scotland and New York City. Spain has recently expanded the use of ex vivo organ perfusion for lung preservation in some centers.

Donation after circulatory determination of death (DCDD) policy conclusions — For those without existing first-person consent, the responsibilities of the surrogate for DCDD "should be made after the decision to withdraw life support occurs", and if first-person consent exists, the DCDD process discussion "should occur in a manner that offers the best collaborative plan to carry out the donation while supporting the family and donor's wishes". Consent "should be obtained by individuals who are appropriately trained" and should include "specific discussions of the types of interventions that may be performed to promote successful organ transplantation as well as the process for declaring death". The committee "supports the ability of physicians to declare death after 2 minutes of absent circulatory function, which we define as mechanical asystole". Pediatric application is affirmed: "DCDD can occur successfully in children", and issues of consent "(except that first-person consent is not applicable to the pediatric population)", ante mortem interventions, and death determination rest on similar principles as in adults. The authors state, "we recommend that hospitals participating in DCDD establish local DCDD protocols that incorporate guidelines for determining death and use of ante mortem interventions that are consistent with this framework and local or national laws".

### Neurological prognostication after cardiac arrest – recommendations from the Swedish resuscitation council [^117VgGJh]. Resuscitation (2013). Low credibility.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is started in 5000 victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Sweden each year and the survival rate is approximately 10%. The subsequent development of a global ischaemic brain injury is the major determinant of the neurological prognosis for those patients who reach the hospital alive. Induced hypothermia is a recommended treatment after cardiac arrest and has been implemented in most Swedish hospitals. Recent studies indicate that induced hypothermia may affect neurological prognostication and previous international recommendations are therefore no longer valid when hypothermia is applied. An expert group from the Swedish Resuscitation Council has reviewed the literature and made recommendations taking into account the effects of induced hypothermia and concomitant sedation. A delayed neurological evaluation at 72 h after rewarming is recommended for hypothermia treated patients. This evaluation should be based on several independent methods and the possibility of lingering pharmacological effects should be considered.

### Circulatory death determination in uncontrolled organ donors: a panel viewpoint [^1126qKgq]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

One barrier for implementing programs of uncontrolled organ donation after the circulatory determination of death is the lack of consensus on the precise moment of death. Our panel was convened to study this question after we performed a similar analysis on the moment of death in controlled organ donation after the circulatory determination of death. We concluded that death could be determined by showing the permanent or irreversible cessation of circulation and respiration. Circulatory irreversibility may be presumed when optimal cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts have failed to restore circulation and at least a 7-minute period has elapsed thereafter during which autoresuscitation to restored circulation could occur. We advise against the use of postmortem organ support technologies that reestablish circulation of warm oxygenated blood because of their risk of retroactively invalidating the required conditions on which death was declared.

Accidental hypothermia — physiologic changes with falling core temperature include brain activity beginning to decline at approximately 33 to 34°C, shivering ceasing at and below approximately 30°C, and cardiac output decreasing markedly as the heart cools below 30°C with susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation (VF) below 28°C. From 35 to 32°C thermoregulatory shivering control is functional and can still be strong at 31°C; below 32°C thermoregulation becomes less effective, rewarming is possible only with addition of exogenous heat, level of consciousness decreases, and below 28°C most patients are unconscious and not shivering with a high risk of VF or asystole.

Discussion

Hypothermia is a preventable cause of death that begins when core body temperature decreases to < 95°F (< 35°C). Initial symptoms include shivering and cool extremities. As hypothermia worsens, symptoms progress to confusion, loss of fine motor skills, and amnesia. Continued heat loss without adequate rewarming can result in hypotension, impaired respiration, cardiac arrhythmias, and death.

This report highlights previously identified risk factors for fatal hypothermia, including advanced age, male sex, drug intoxication, homelessness, and mental illness. Older persons have impaired heat generation and often multiple comorbidities that increase the risk for death. Substance and alcohol abuse can contribute to hypothermia by blunting physiologic responses to cold and can lead to prolonged exposure caused by impaired judgment. A review of Wisconsin hypothermia-related deaths revealed that approximately half of decedents lived alone, which can lead to substantial delays in treatment if persons are incapacitated by injury or illness.

Prompt recognition of the signs and symptoms of hypothermia is necessary for reducing mortality. Patients should be rewarmed by using external warming (e.g. blankets or forced heated air) for mild hypothermia and internal warming methods (e.g. body cavity lavage) for severe hypothermia. In the event of cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be performed during rewarming in accordance with published guidelines.

Greater awareness of severe weather events and the need for emergency and disaster response has led to increased public health attention to weather-related response planning. One of the most visible components of such plans is the opening of publically available warming shelters when extreme cold is expected. However, this report suggests that state and local health agencies also might need to focus more on public education, communication networks to reach the most vulnerable persons, and targeted interventions for groups at risk (e.g. older persons, homeless, and those living alone). Educational materials should emphasize the rapidity with which hypothermia can occur, review the warning signs of hypothermia, and outline ways to reduce risk (e.g. wearing suitable clothing, avoiding hazardous weather situations, and preparing for such emergencies as motor vehicle breakdowns and power outages). Emphasizing how alcohol consumption and certain drugs increase the risk for cold-related injuries and hypothermia also might be helpful.

### Targeted temperature management after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: certainties and uncertainties [^112gWsNU]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The results of the TTM trial were unequivocal, demonstrating no difference in survival or the secondary outcome of combined survival and neurological outcome. An important design feature of the TTM trial, distinguishing it from earlier trials, was the approach to prognostication and withdrawal of care in patients remaining unconscious. Prognostication was delayed for 108 hours (unless specific withdrawal criteria were met) and performed by a clinician who was blinded to the intervention and who then recommended withdrawal, continuation, or no further escalation of care.

The robust design of the TTM trial has been recognized by a number of commentators, including an author of one of the landmark trials. However, others have questioned the validity of the study, raising concerns over the rate of rewarming, temperature separation and swings, and recruitment rates. It has been argued that the rate of rewarming was rapid, abrogating the benefits of cooling to 33°C. The optimal rate of rewarming remains unknown but was undertaken at a maximum speed of 0.5°C per hour in keeping with current guidelines. The actual rewarming rate in the TTM trial was 0.36 ± 0.13°C per hour, which seems comparable to the rate in the Hypothermia after Cardiac Arrest trial, and the two temperature arms were clearly well controlled and separated (Figure 1). The TTM trial aimed to reflect current clinical practice, including as large a population as possible to make the results applicable to use by clinicians. On the basis of registries, 80% of patients meeting inclusion criteria in the TTM trial would be eligible for random assignment after exclusion criteria were considered. The 66% screening to inclusion (and 76% random assignment of patients meeting inclusion criteria) represents a considerable effort by participating sites. Although the study ran more than 26 months, it was not until 9 months that 50% of sites were open to recruitment. The median number of patients randomly assigned per site was 21, and sites above the median recruited 80% of all patients.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for prevention and management of avalanche and nonavalanche snow burial accidents: 2024 update [^112rwAh7]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Time–temperature decision thresholds for avalanche burial — In victims buried ≤ 60 min with core temperatures ≥ 30°C, cardiac arrest is usually due to trauma or asphyxia rather than hypothermia, extracorporeal life support (ECLS) rewarming is contraindicated, and if standard CPR or ALS does not achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) within 30 min, further resuscitation should be terminated. If duration of burial is > 60 min, core temperature < 30°C, and the airway is patent, cardiac arrest may have been caused by hypothermia, so rescuers should attempt prolonged CPR, transfer to definitive care, and extracorporeal rewarming; CPR and ALS may need to continue beyond 60 min, defibrillation may be unsuccessful if core temperature is ≤ 30°C, but prolonged CPR may succeed until rewarmed to 30°C, and delayed/intermittent CPR may be necessary when core temperature is < 28°C.

### Rethinking brain death-why "Dead enough" is not good enough: the UDDA revision series [^111qLLc2]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

The emergence of cases of so-called "chronic brain death" seems to undermine the biophilosophical justification of brain death as true death, which was grounded in the idea that death entails the loss of integration of the organism. Severely neurologically damaged patients who can persist for years with proper support seem to be integrated organisms, and common sense suggests that they are not dead. We argue, however, that mere integration is not enough for an organism to be alive, but that living beings must be substantially self -integrating (i.e., a living organism must itself be the primary source of its integration and not an external agent such as a scientist or physician). We propose that irreversible apnea and unresponsiveness are necessary but not sufficient to judge that a human being has lost enough capacity for self-integration to be considered dead. To be declared dead, the patient must also irrevocably have lost either (1) cardiac function or (2) cerebrosomatic homeostatic control. Even if such bodies can be maintained with sufficient technological support, one may reasonably judge that the locus of integration effectively has passed from the patient to the treatment team. While organs and cells may be alive, one may justifiably declare that there is no longer a substantially autonomous, whole, living human organism. This biophilosophical conception of death implies that the notion of brain death remains viable, but that additional testing will be required to ensure that the individual is truly brain dead by virtue of having irrevocably lost not only the capacity for spontaneous respiration and conscious responsiveness but also the capacity for cerebrosomatic homeostatic control.

Good Practice Statements

In accordance with recommendations of the GRADE network, these statements were considered by the panel to be actionable, supported by indirect evidence where appropriate, and essential to guide the practice of neuroprognostication. The good clinical practice reflected in these statements lacked a meaningful body of direct supporting evidence (typically because of insufficient clinical equipoise) but was considered by the panel to be unequivocally beneficial.

Good Practice Statement 1

We recommend deferral of assessment of the neurological prognosis of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest for at least 72 h following ROSC in patients not treated with therapeutic hypothermia (goal temperature < 36.5 °C) and at least 72 h following rewarming in patients treated with hypothermia.

### Do lower target temperatures or prolonged cooling provide improved outcomes for comatose survivors of cardiac arrest treated with hypothermia? [^112JVhhn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Sudden cardiac arrest is a major cause of unexpected death in developed countries and is a major clinical issue. Despite cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), only a few patients are able to return to their former lifestyle. Among out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims, 80% were comatose after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and 6% to 8% survived to hospital discharge. Targeted temperature management (TTM), so-called therapeutic hypothermia, improves survival and neurological outcomes in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. The current resuscitation guidelines recommended that comatose adult patients with ROSC after out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest should be cooled to 32°C to 34°C for 12 to 24 hours as class I, according to the protocols in the randomized clinical trials.–However, there were many unsolved questions regarding TTM, such as the optimal target temperature (TT) and cooling and rewarming durations. Adverse postreperfusion cascades result in delayed neuronal death, which occurs minutes to days after reperfusion; on the other hand, TTM was usually discontinued within 12 to 24 hours of cooling, which was not long enough to finish some of the above cascade. In some animal models, longer cooling durations were associated with a more neuroprotective effect than shorter durations of cooling. Meanwhile, regarding the rewarming duration, rapid rewarming was associated with adverse outcomes in basic research. In the context of TTs, cerebral metabolic rates decrease by 7% for every 1°C reduction in an animal model, and it was reported that lower TTs may provide more neuroprotection in animal studies. We assessed the hypothesis that lower TTs and/or prolonged cooling was associated with improved neurological outcomes in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest.

### Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation rewarming in the ED: an opportunity for success [^1163Py46]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

On average, approximately 1300 Americans die of hypothermia each year. Although accidental hypothermia is commonly associated with severely cold regions or mountain accident victims, hypothermia also commonly occurs in urban centers. Contributing factors often include homelessness, mental illness, and substance abuse. Hypothermia can profoundly affect the cardiovascular system. As the myocardium cools, the conduction system slows down, which results in prolongation of the QT interval as well as propensity for arrhythmias. Eventually, bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, and ventricular fibrillation (VF) can develop. The risk of cardiac arrest increases as the core temperature drops below 32°C and increases substantially when less than 28°C.

### Witnessed cardiac arrest in a hypothermic avalanche victim completely buried for 2 hours [^114u6aqf]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

A 34-y-old skier triggered a wind slab avalanche and was completely buried for over 2 h. After extrication by rescuers, the victim was breathing and conscious. Despite directions from the rescuers against standing up, the victim struggled to free himself and ultimately stood upright before collapsing in cardiac arrest. The rescuers performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation during transport to a nearby trailhead, where a helicopter emergency medical services crew found that the victim was in ventricular fibrillation. After further resuscitative efforts, including advanced life support, the victim was declared dead at the scene. Afterdrop and circumrescue collapse were the most likely triggers of cardiac arrest. This case highlights a need for rescuers, emergency medical services, and hospitals to be prepared to care for victims with hypothermia. To prevent circumrescue collapse, victims with hypothermia should be extricated gently, should not be allowed to stand, and should be placed flat. This may be difficult or impossible, as in this case. Hypothermic victims in cardiac arrest may require prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation, preferably with mechanical compressions, during transport to a hospital that has protocols for rewarming using extracorporeal life support. Resuscitation from hypothermic cardiac arrest should not be terminated before the victim has been rewarmed.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the out-of-hospital evaluation and treatment of accidental hypothermia: 2019 update [^11496HQ7]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Core temperature afterdrop — definition, mechanisms, risks, and precautions: Core temperature afterdrop refers to continued core cooling after removal from a cold environment and is caused by a combination of conductive heat loss from the warmer core to cooler peripheral tissue and convective heat loss from blood due to increased flow to cooler tissue and subsequent return to the central circulation and heart. The convective component transfers more heat and, unlike the conductive component, is affected by the method of rewarming, and in a hypothermia victim, peripheral tissue is colder than the heart. Therefore, any action that increases blood flow to cold peripheral tissue (eg, hoisting or holding victim in a vertical position, allowing the victim to stand or walk, active or passive limb movement, immersion in warm water) will increase the volume of cold blood returning to the heart, which increases cardiac work and further decreases core temperature. Afterdrop may be clinically important in victims who are at the threshold of moderate to severe hypothermia because they are susceptible to cardiovascular instability with a small further drop in core (heart) temperature, and afterdrop of as much as 5 to 6°C has been reported in hypothermic patients. Therefore, care should be taken to prevent increased blood flow to the limbs during and after rescue.

Misdiagnoses

The nine patients with BD misdiagnosis included eight termed "functionally brain‐dead" (FBD; i.e. after pronouncement of BD according to properly applied diagnostic criteria, there was subsequent detection of ≥ 1 findings that were incongruent with guidelines for its diagnosis, albeit the lethal prognosis was not altered) cases and one case of neurological recovery and survival. The age at BD misdiagnosis ranged from 2 days to 55 years. In the eight FBD cases, the type of neurological finding that was incongruent with a previous diagnosis of BD varied from resurfacing of spontaneous breathing to movements on command. The duration of such incongruent findings ranged from 30 min to 4.5 years. We specifically refer to the lapsed time between the detection and the disappearance of a clinical finding incongruent with the previous declaration of BD. The incongruent finding could not be present at the declaration of BD; otherwise, such declaration would not have been made. Additionally, the incongruent finding could disappear before somatic death occurred. Possible confounding factors for certain diagnoses of BD were hypothermia and neurotropic drugs, although their relevance was contested by the authors. Treatment was withdrawn in five of the eight FBD patients, whose somatic survival ranged from 2 h to 4.5 years. The sole case of neurological recovery occurred in a premature (35 weeks gestational age) female newborn, who was declared BD (with absence of confounding factors) following cerebral hemorrhage. She was deemed BD from 40 to 120 h after birth, after which a steady neurological recovery ensued. The patient was found in good health at 1‐year follow up. Details of the BD misdiagnoses are available in Figure 4.

Functional warm ischemic time (FWIT) parameters for DCD hearts — In most reported successful DCD heart transplants, the functional warm ischemic time (FWIT) has been less than 30 minutes, measured from when donor systolic blood pressure falls below 50 mm Hg until organ circulation is reestablished (or until flushing for direct procurement). When the FWIT exceeds 30 minutes, preclinical studies suggest severe injury likely to result in primary graft failure if transplanted, and human DCD hearts with FWIT more than 30 minutes are less likely to meet viability criteria with current preservation strategies. The total ischemic insult includes both the FWIT and periods of cold ischemia.

Key Points for Practice
- To prevent worsening tissue damage, a frostbitten extremity should be rewarmed only if there is no risk of refreezing.
- Rapid rewarming via water bath immersion and intravenous low-molecular-weight dextran leads to improved outcomes in frostbite.
- To limit tissue loss, oral ibuprofen should be started as soon as available and continued until surgery or complete healing. Mild hypothermia can be treated concurrently with frostbite. Moderate to severe hypothermia should be treated before initiating frostbite treatment. The effect of hydration on frostbite outcomes has not been studied, but appropriate hydration is important for recovery. Oral fluids can be given to alert patients; otherwise, intravenous saline should be administered to maintain urine output.

FIELD REWARMING Although outcomes are better with rapid rewarming, frostbite should be allowed to thaw spontaneously if rapid rewarming is not possible. Rapid rewarming in the field should be performed only if definitive care is more than two hours away and refreezing can be prevented. Rewarming is complete when the injured extremity appears red or purple and becomes soft and pliable, typically within 30 minutes depending on the extent and depth of frostbite. To minimize further tissue damage, skin should air dry or be gently blotted dry. Bulky gauze dressings, with or without aloe vera cream, should be applied to thawed areas for protection and wound care. Substantial edema should be anticipated. If possible, thawed extremities should be elevated above the heart to decrease edema.

Immediate Treatment Once the patient reaches a hospital or high-level field clinic, frozen tissue should be assessed to determine whether spontaneous thawing has occurred. Further rewarming is not beneficial if tissue has completely thawed. It is common practice to drain clear blisters and leave hemorrhagic blisters intact, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend this practice. Daily or twice-daily hydrotherapy at 98. 6 to
102. 2°F has been recommended in the post-thaw period. Evidence on outcomes is lacking, but hydrotherapy has few negative sequelae and may benefit recovery. Although hyperbaric oxygen therapy has resulted in faster and more complete healing for many types of nonfrostbite wounds, it is not recommended in frostbite because of the risk of vasoconstriction from hyperoxemia.

### The use of extracorporeal rewarming in a child submerged for 66 minutes… [^117CghDZ]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

A 2 1/2year-old girl had a good neurologic recovery after submersion in cold water for at least 66 minutes; as far as we know, this is the longest time ever reported. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was maintained for more than two hours before the initiation of extracorporeal rewarming in this child who had a core temperature of 19°C. To our knowledge, this is the first successful use of extracorporeal rewarming in a child suffering from accidental hypothermia. Extension of this technique to children offers rapid rewarming and cardiovascular support for pediatric victims of severe hypothermia. We emphasize the importance of a coordinated response by the entire emergency medical system integrated with hospital-based personnel. Where it is geographically feasible, regionalization of triage and care for the pediatric victim of severe accidental hypothermia should be considered.
