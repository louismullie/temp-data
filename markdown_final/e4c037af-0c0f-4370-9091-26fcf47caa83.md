## Question

Which pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for 50-year-old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for a 50-year-old adult. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most current ACIP recommendations and whether they have expanded age-based eligibility to include adults aged 50–64 years. Then, I should verify which specific pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are now recommended for this age group. Next, I will review how to choose among PCV options, including any PPSV23 follow-up requirements, and whether shared clinical decision-making applies. Finally, I should consider any special circumstances, like prior pneumococcal vaccination or immunocompromising conditions, before concluding with a concise, actionable recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the age-based recommendation. I initially thought universal pneumococcal conjugate vaccination started at 65, but wait, let me verify the latest ACIP update. On October 23, 2024, ACIP expanded its age-based recommendation to recommend a single dose of PCV for all PCV-naïve adults aged 50 years and older, moving the age threshold down from 65 to 50 years [^111fyNFo] [^111wfDei] [^115HVEHj].

> I need to check which vaccines qualify for this recommendation. The updated adult immunization schedule lists PCV15, PCV20, and PCV21 as acceptable options for adults aged 50 years and older who have never received a PCV or whose PCV history is unknown; the yellow shading on the schedule indicates a routine age-based recommendation for this group, so any of these three conjugate vaccines would meet the new standard [^1132FJsJ] [^111z4pRM].

> Hold on, I should verify how to choose among PCV15, PCV20, and PCV21. If PCV15 is selected, a subsequent dose of PPSV23 is generally indicated about a year later to broaden serotype coverage; if PCV20 or PCV21 is used, no additional pneumococcal vaccine is indicated, which simplifies completion of the series in a single visit [^1132FJsJ] [^111z4pRM]. Let me consider serotype coverage briefly: PCV21 was designed with adult disease burden in mind and covers several serotypes not included in PCV15/PCV20, though regional variation exists, and some communities with high serotype 4 disease may derive relatively greater benefit from PCV20 or PCV15+PPSV23 than from PCV21, which does not include serotype 4; ACIP provides localized guidance in such settings, so shared clinical decision-making about product selection is reasonable when local epidemiology is known [^114boNjL] [^115NsiyU].

> But wait, what if the patient already received a pneumococcal vaccine in the past. I should confirm the catch-up pathway. For adults previously vaccinated only with PPSV23, ACIP advises offering a PCV (PCV15, PCV20, or PCV21) at least one year after the last PPSV23 dose; for those who previously received PCV13 or earlier PCVs, discuss options with the provider, and adults aged 65 years and older have the option to receive PCV20 or PCV21 if they already received both PCV13 and PPSV23, though the new universal PCV recommendation applies to PCV-naïve adults aged 50 years and older [^113XEmco] [^117UWLA6] [^111wfDei].

> I should double-check whether there are special considerations for immunocompromised patients or those with high-risk conditions. The new age-based recommendation is for all PCV-naïve adults aged 50 and older, and prior risk-based recommendations still apply for adults 19–49 years with qualifying conditions; if immunocompromising conditions are present, certain intervals and series details may differ, but the fundamental point here is that for a 50-year-old without prior PCV, the routine recommendation is one dose of PCV now, with product selection guided by availability, patient preference, and local epidemiology, and with the need for PPSV23 only if PCV15 is chosen [^111wfDei] [^111z4pRM].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final, concise recommendation. For a 50-year-old adult who has never received a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, administer a single dose of PCV15, PCV20, or PCV21. If PCV15 is selected, follow with PPSV23 about one year later, whereas PCV20 or PCV21 require no additional pneumococcal vaccine to complete the series, aligning with ACIP's 2024 expansion to routine PCV vaccination beginning at age 50 [^1132FJsJ] [^111wfDei] [^111z4pRM].

---

For a 50-year-old adult who is **PCV-naive**, give a **single dose of PCV20 or PCV21** [^111fyNFo]. If PCV15 is used, **administer PPSV23 8 weeks to 1 year later** [^111z4pRM]. If prior PPSV23 was given, wait at least 1 year before giving any PCV [^113XEmco]. These recommendations apply to all adults aged ≥ 50 years, regardless of risk factors [^1132FJsJ].

---

## Recommended pneumococcal vaccines for adults aged 50 years and older

The **current ACIP recommendations** for adults aged 50 years and older are:

- **PCV20 or PCV21**: A single dose for all PCV-naive adults aged ≥ 50 years [^111fyNFo].
- **PCV15**: A single dose followed by PPSV23 8 weeks to 1 year later [^111z4pRM].
- **Previously vaccinated**: If prior PPSV23 was given, wait ≥ 1 year before any PCV; if prior PCV13, follow previous ACIP guidance [^113XEmco] [^111fyNFo].

---

## Rationale for expanded recommendations

ACIP's expansion to **routine PCV at age ≥ 50 years** is supported by:

- **Disease burden**: Substantial morbidity and mortality in adults aged 50–64 years [^116USpZD].
- **Risk factors**: High prevalence of comorbidities and risk factors in this age group [^116USpZD].
- **Equity**: Potential to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in pneumococcal disease [^114boNjL].
- **Coverage**: Expected to improve vaccination uptake and simplify implementation [^111wfDei].

---

## Vaccine options and their coverage

| **Vaccine** | **Serotypes covered** | **Key features** |
|-|-|-|
| PCV15 | 15 serotypes | Requires PPSV23 follow-up for broader coverage [^111wfDei] |
| PCV20 | 20 serotypes | Single-dose regimen; broad coverage [^112Vd2Qs] |
| PCV21 | 21 serotypes | Single-dose regimen; designed for adult disease burden [^114boNjL] |

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

- **Contraindications**: Severe allergic reaction to any vaccine component or prior dose [^notfound].
- **Precautions**: Moderate or severe acute illness; defer until recovery [^notfound].
- **Immunocompromised**: May require adjusted timing and additional doses [^111z4pRM].

---

## Summary of recommendations

For a 50-year-old adult who is **PCV-naive**, give a **single dose of PCV20 or PCV21** [^111fyNFo]. If PCV15 is used, **administer PPSV23 8 weeks to 1 year later** [^111z4pRM]. If prior PPSV23 was given, wait at least 1 year before any PCV [^113XEmco]. These recommendations apply to all adults aged ≥ 50 years, regardless of risk factors [^1132FJsJ].

Purpose

The goal of this article was to review the key clinical trials that resulted in the recent recommendation from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to vaccinate all adults aged ≥ 65 years with the 13-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in addition to the previously recommended 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23).

Methods

Pertinent articles were identified through searches of EMBASE and MEDLINE by using the terms pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine, and PCV13. Searches were limited to articles published between January 1, 2013, and January 31, 2015, and were limited to clinical trials. Resources from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's ACIP recommendations and cited references were also reviewed.

Findings

Recent clinical trials have focused on the order of administration of PPSV23 and PCV13, comparisons in immunogenicity of PPSV23 and PCV13, and efficacy of PCV13 in adults aged ≥ 65 years. Immunogenicity trials have shown that PCV13 elicits an equal or greater immune response than PPSV23 for most of the serotypes that both vaccines share. The evidence suggests that PCV13 should be administered before PPSV23 when possible. Most recently, clinical data demonstrated the efficacy of PCV13 in adults aged ≥ 65 years.

Implications

Recent randomized clinical trials and disease trends have prompted the ACIP to recommend that all adults aged ≥ 65 years receive a single dose of PCV13. This is in addition to the previous recommended single dose of PPSV23 in the same population. The ACIP and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plan to monitor disease trends and clinical data to determine if this recommendation will need to be changed in the future.

Regarding preventative measures for pneumococcal vaccination in adults, more specifically with respect to schedules, CDC 2019 guidelines recommend to recognize that PPSV23 contains 12 serotypes in common with PCV13 and an additional 11 serotypes for which there are no indirect effects from PCV13 use in children. Recognize that the additional 11 serotypes account for 32–37% of invasive pneumococcal diseases among adults aged ≥ 65 years.

### Adult vaccination [^1175vyQD]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Adult vaccination rates are low in the United States, despite clear benefits for reducing morbidity and mortality. Vaccine science is evolving rapidly, and family physicians must maintain familiarity with the most recent guidelines. The recommended adult immunization schedule is updated annually by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All eligible patients should receive SARS-CoV-2 vaccines according to the current guidelines. Adults without contraindications should also receive an annual influenza vaccine. Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for adults with specific risk factors. All pregnant patients, adults younger than 60 years, and those 60 years and older who have risk factors should receive a hepatitis B vaccine. A 15- or 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is recommended for all patients who are 65 years and older. Patients who receive 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine should receive a dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine one year later. Adults 19 to 64 years of age should receive a pneumococcal vaccination if they have medical risk factors. A single dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine is recommended for adults without presumptive immunity, and additional doses are recommended for patients with HIV and postdelivery for pregnant patients who are not immune to rubella. A tetanus and diphtheria toxoids booster is recommended every 10 years. For pregnant patients and those in close contact with young infants, a tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine should be administered. The human papillomavirus vaccine is recommended for all people through 26 years of age. Herpes zoster vaccine is indicated for all adults 50 years and older.

### Exploring the future adult vaccine landscape-crowded schedules and new dynamics [^115ymrXZ]. NPJ Vaccines (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition to expanded vaccine offerings, we also anticipate growing competition, with four historical leaders in the field (GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Pfizer, and Sanofi) making significant advancements. However, it should be noted that the COVID-19 pandemic has likely reshuffled the adult vaccine landscape, which has become one of the most competitive spaces in pharma. There has been increased pressure from both new entrants with differentiated technology platforms (such as Moderna's mRNA portfolio and Dynavax's adjuvant offering) and low-margin, high-volume global players (such as Serum Institute of India, Bharat Biotech, and Sinovac). Additionally, as best-in-class products likely will not be enough to capture the market, manufacturers are expected to distinguish themselves through differentiated portfolio offerings, rather than individual products.

With the increasing number of adult vaccines entering the market, adult vaccine schedules are expected to undergo substantial expansion over the next decade (Supplementary Fig. 2). The current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) adult vaccine schedule recommends that individuals aged 18 and above receive vaccines for influenza and COVID-19. It is also recommended that adults aged 50 and above get the Zoster vaccine, while those aged 65 and above are recommended pneumococcal vaccines. Moreover, both vaccines are recommended for adults aged 18 and older who have compromised immune systems. Those under 65 are recommended to get vaccinated against hepatitis B. Recently, two new RSV vaccines have been approved and may be considered for adults aged 60 and older through the process of shared clinical decision-making, as per SCDM guidelines. Looking forward to the next 10 years, we foresee most new vaccines being specifically developed for certain high-risk groups, irrespective of their age. For example, C. diff vaccines may be recommended for those aged 65 and above that are admitted to a hospital or long-term care facilities. We anticipate that COVID-19 and RSV vaccines will begin to mirror the pattern seen with the influenza vaccine, possibly evolving into seasonal vaccines –. This suggests that adults may be recommended to receive these vaccines annually, typically within a three-month window, assuming current seasonal vaccination behavior (agnostic of potential recommendation).

### Pivotal phase 3 randomized clinical trial of the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in adults aged ≥ 18 years [^111LBAU4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have significantly reduced pneumococcal disease, but disease from non-PCV serotypes remains. The safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a 20-valent PCV (PCV20) were evaluated.

Methods

This pivotal phase 3, randomized, double-blind study enrolled adults into 3 age groups (≥ 60, 50–59, and 18–49 years) at US and Swedish sites. Participants were randomized to receive 1 PCV20 or 13-valent PCV (PCV13) dose. After 1 month, participants aged ≥ 60 years also received 1 dose of saline or 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). Safety assessments included local reactions, systemic events, adverse events, serious adverse events, and newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions. Opsonophagocytic activity geometric mean titers 1 month after PCV20 were compared with 13 matched serotypes after PCV13 and 7 additional serotypes after PPSV23 in participants aged ≥ 60 years; noninferiority was declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the opsonophagocytic activity geometric mean titer ratio (ratio of PCV20/saline to PCV13/PPSV23 group) was > 0.5. PCV20-elicited immune responses in younger participants were also bridged to those in 60–64-year-olds.

Results

The severity and frequency of prompted local reactions and systemic events were similar after PCV20 or PCV13; no safety concerns were identified. Primary immunogenicity objectives were met, with immune responses after PCV20 noninferior to 13 matched serotypes after PCV13 and to 6 additional PPSV23 serotypes in participants aged ≥ 60 years; serotype 8 missed the statistical noninferiority criterion. PCV20 induced robust responses to all 20 vaccine serotypes across age groups.

Conclusions

PCV20 was safe and well tolerated, with immunogenicity comparable to that of PCV13 or PPSV23. PCV20 is anticipated to expand protection against pneumococcal disease in adults.

### Pneumococcal disease in adults and vaccines to prevent It… [^111ShCxk]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Pneumococcal disease in adults can range from mild to serious, and can sometimes be deadly.
- Two types of vaccines provide protection against pneumococcal disease.
- Talk to a healthcare provider to see if they recommend these or any other vaccines for you. Types of infections Pneumococcal disease is a term used for a wide range of infections caused by bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae. Mild infections Ear and sinus infections are examples of the mild infections these bacteria can cause. Although rare, people can have serious infections or complications from ear and sinus infections. Serious infections The following types of pneumococcal disease can be very serious, even deadly:

- Pneumonia
- Bacteremia
- Meningitis Keep Reading: Symptoms and Complications.

Adults at increased risk Being a certain age or having certain medical conditions can put adults at increased risk for pneumococcal disease. Age Adults 50 years or older are at increased risk for pneumococcal disease. Risk conditions Certain chronic conditions, immunocompromising conditions, and other factors like cigarette smoking can increase someone's risk for pneumococcal disease. Keep Reading: Cause, Spread, and Risk Factors. Vaccination Two types of vaccines used in the United States help prevent pneumococcal disease in adults: conjugate and polysaccharide vaccines. Recommendations CDC recommends pneumococcal conjugate vaccination for previously unvaccinated adults: 50 years or older: All 19 through 49 years old: At increased risk for pneumococcal disease If PCV15 is used, it should be followed by a dose of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.

Previously vaccinated Adults who received an earlier pneumococcal conjugate vaccine should talk with a vaccine provider. The provider can explain options available to complete the recommended pneumococcal vaccine series. Adults 65 years or older have the option to get PCV20 or PCV21, or to not get additional pneumococcal vaccines. They can get PCV20 or PCV21 if they have already received both of the following:

- PCV13 at any age
- PPSV23 at or after the age of 65 years old These adults can talk with a vaccine provider and decide, together, whether to get vaccinated. Risks Pneumococcal vaccines are safe, but side effects can occur.

Adults receiving pneumococcal conjugate and polysaccharide vaccines have reported mild side effects such as:

- Fatigue
- Headache
- Mild fever and chills
- Muscle pain
- Redness, pain, and swelling at the injection site Life-threatening allergic reactions from either type of vaccine are rare. Keep Reading: Pneumococcal Vaccination.

### Pivotal phase 3 randomized clinical trial of the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in adults aged ≥ 18 years [^112pdfWb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Design and Participants

This phase 3, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study was conducted between December 2018 and December 2019 in the United States and Sweden (NCT03760146; Figure 1). The study population comprised ≥ 18-year-olds in 3 cohorts based on age at enrollment (≥ 60, 50–59, and 18–49 years). Additional details are in the Supplementary Appendix and the study protocol, available at ClinicalTrials.gov. Participants were to be generally healthy or with a stable underlying disease. Key exclusion criteria included previous vaccination with any pneumococcal vaccine, diagnosis of a serious unstable chronic disorder or immunocompromising condition, or treatment with immunosuppressive therapies (detailed in Supplementary Appendix).

Figure 1.
Study design. Abbreviations: PCV13, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; PCV20, 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; PPSV23, 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.

Participants aged ≥ 60 years were randomized 1:1 to receive a 0.5-mL dose of PCV20 or PCV13 at the first visit then a 0.5-mL dose of saline or PPSV23, respectively, 1 month later. The 1-month interval between control vaccines, while not a formally recommended schedule, provided a contemporaneous control for all 20 serotypes and was previously used in the phase 2 study. Randomization was stratified by age subgroup; approximately one-third of participants aged ≥ 60 years were planned to be aged ≥ 65 years. Participants aged 18–49 or 50–59 years were randomized 3:1 to receive a 0.5-mL dose of PCV20 or PCV13 (Figure 1). The study was conducted in accordance with local ethical principles and guidelines (see Supplementary Appendix).

### What about vaccine-experienced younger adults? Cost-effectiveness of PCV21 use in vaccine-experienced US adults aged 19–64 years with underlying medical conditions [^114semGP]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Because of the residual pneumococcal disease burden among vaccineexperienced adults aged 19–64 years with underlying medical conditions in the United States (US), the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended revaccination with higher valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV). Following PCV21's 2024 introduction, it was added as an option. This study evaluated the cost‑effectiveness of PCV21 versus the recommended alternatives (PPSV23, PCV15, and PCV20) in this population.

Methods

A published static multi-cohort state-transition Markov model was used to estimate the lifetime incremental clinical and societal economic outcomes of administering a single dose of PCV21 in adults aged 19–64 years who were previously vaccinated 5 years ago with PPSV23 or PCV13, or 2 years ago with PCV15. The estimated total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs (in 2023 USD) were discounted at an annual rate of 3%, as well as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) reported as $/QALY gained. Probabilistic/Deterministic sensitivity analysis (PSA/DSA) and scenario Analysis was conducted.

Results

Among 19–49 year-olds, compared with PPSV23, the ICER of PCV21 in the PCV13- and PCV15-experienced adults was $99,700 and $149,300, respectively. PCV21 was cost-saving versus PCV15 in the PPSV23-experienced and versus PCV20 across all vaccine-experienced population. Among 50–64 year-olds, compared with PPSV23, the ICER of PCV21 was $62,400/QALY in PCV13-experienced and $85,400 in PCV15-experienced. PCV21 was cost-saving compared with PCV15 or with PCV20 across all vaccine-experienced population. The DSA identified that discount rates and vaccine effectiveness were the most influential inputs. The PSA confirmed the results' robustness. The scenario analysis showed only minor changes in ICER when the time since last vaccination extended to 8 years for the PPSV23 or PCV13-experienced younger adults.

Conclusions

The use of PCV21 in US adults aged 19–64 years with underlying medical conditions can be cost-effective, or cost-saving in most cases, across a wide range of scenarios.

Regarding preventative measures for pneumococcal vaccination in adults, more specifically with respect to timing and intervals, CDC 2019 guidelines recommend to administer PCV13, if such a decision is made, before PPSV23. Keep ≥ 1-year intervals between pneumococcal vaccines, regardless of the order in which they were received, in adults without an immunocompromising condition, CSF leak, or cochlear implant.

### The impact of routine vaccinations on Alzheimer's disease risk in persons 65 years and older: a claims-based cohort study using propensity score matching [^111wvuFM]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster is caused by reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus. Estimates of lifetime HZ incidence show that nearly one-third of the world's population will develop HZ. Patients with a history of HZ have an increased risk for developing dementia. The HZ vaccine currently recommended in the US, Shingrix, has been available since 2017 to patients 50 years and older and immunocompromised patients 19 years and older. Shingrix is a recombinant vaccine containing varicella-zoster glycoprotein E antigen and an adjuvant which is given as a two-dose series. It has been demonstrated to be 97% effective at preventing HZ in patients 50 to 69 years old, and 91% effective in patients 70 years and older. From 2008 to 2020, the live-attenuated varicella vaccine, Zostavax, was recommended in the US for the prevention of HZ among those 60 and older. The Zostavax vaccine reduces the risk of HZ by 51%.

Pneumococcal infection is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (i.e. pneumococcus). Patients 65 and older are at higher risk for severe disease. There are two types of pneumococcal vaccines for adults: the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV-23) and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13, PCV15, or PCV20). The PPSV-23 vaccine contains the purified capsular polysaccharide for twenty-three different serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae; whereas the PCV-13 vaccine only contains thirteen serotypes, but also contains a modified diphtheria toxin protein as a conjugant. PPSV-23 was first approved for use in 1983, and until 2021, the CDC recommended that all adults 65 and older receive a dose of PPSV-23. Between 2014–2019, the CDC recommended that adults aged 65 years and older receive a dose of PCV-13 prior to the PPSV-23. Since June 2019, however, PCV-13 is no longer routinely recommended for immunocompetent adults 65 or older. Instead, it is given after "shared clinical decision-making". PCV-13 is 75% effective at preventing invasive serotype-specific pneumococcal disease, while PPSV-23 is 60–70% effective.

### Use of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine among adults aged ≥ 65 years: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^1172EPTF]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

On August 13, 2014, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine use of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13 [Prevnar 13, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc. a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc.]) among adults aged ≥ 65 years. PCV13 should be administered in series with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23 [Pneumovax23, Merck & Co. Inc.]), the vaccine currently recommended for adults aged ≥ 65 years. PCV13 was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late 2011 for use among adults aged ≥ 50 years. In June 2014, the results of a randomized placebo-controlled trial evaluating efficacy of PCV13 for preventing community-acquired pneumonia among approximately 85,000 adults aged ≥ 65 years with no prior pneumococcal vaccination history (CAPiTA trial) became available and were presented to ACIP. The evidence supporting PCV13 vaccination of adults was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and determined to be type 2 (moderate level of evidence); the recommendation was categorized as a Category A recommendation. This report outlines the new recommendations for PCV13 use, provides guidance for use of PCV13 and PPSV23 among adults aged ≥ 65 years, and summarizes the evidence considered by ACIP to make this recommendation.

Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children, adolescents, and adults are developed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP is chartered as a federal advisory committee to provide expert external advice and guidance to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on use of vaccines and related agents for the control of vaccine-preventable diseases in the civilian population of the United States. Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children and adolescents are harmonized to the greatest extent possible with recommendations made by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG). Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in adults are harmonized with recommendations of AAFP, ACOG, and the American College of Physicians (ACP). ACIP recommendations adopted by the CDC Director become agency guidelines on the date published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Additional information regarding ACIP is available at.

Regarding preventative measures for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pneumococcal vaccination, CDC 2019 guidelines recommend to take into account the individual patient's risk for exposure to PCV13 serotypes and the risk for pneumococcal disease for that person as a result of underlying medical conditions when patients and vaccine providers engage in shared clinical decision-making for PCV13 use to determine whether PCV13 is right for the specific individual aged ≥ 65 years.

PCV13 Vaccine in Adults

On December 30, 2011, PCV13 was approved for use among adults aged ≥ 50 years to prevent pneumonia and invasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae serotypes contained in the vaccine. The new use for Prevnar 13 was approved under FDA's accelerated approval pathway, which allows for earlier approval of products that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for serious and life-threatening illnesses. FDA defined "meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments" as protection of adults aged ≥ 50 years from nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia or nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia combined with protection from IPD. On June 20, 2012, ACIP recommended routine use of PCV13 for adults aged ≥ 19 years with immunocompromising conditions, functional or anatomic asplenia, cerebrospinal fluid leak, or cochlear implants. The ACIP decision to recommend PCV13 use among adults aged ≥ 65 years was deferred until data became available on 1) the impact of PCV13 use in children on disease in adults (i.e. indirect effects) and 2) the efficacy of PCV13 against noninvasive pneumococcal pneumonia among adults. In accordance with accelerated approval requirements, a randomized placebo-controlled trial (CAPiTA trial) was conducted in the Netherlands among approximately 85,000 adults aged ≥ 65 years during 2008–2013 to verify and describe further the clinical benefit of PCV13 in the prevention of pneumococcal pneumonia. The results of the CAPiTA trial demonstrated 45.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 21.8%–62.5%) efficacy of PCV13 against vaccine-type pneumococcal pneumonia, 45.0% (CI = 14.2%–65.3%) efficacy against vaccine-type nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, and 75.0% (CI = 41.4%–90.8%) efficacy against vaccine-type IPD among adults aged ≥ 65 years.

### Healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of communicating with people over 50 years of age about vaccination: a qualitative evidence synthesis [^112YDPKs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Infectious diseases are a major cause of illness and death among older adults. Vaccines can prevent infectious diseases, including against seasonal influenza, pneumococcal diseases, herpes zoster and COVID-19. However, the uptake of vaccination among older adults varies across settings and groups. Communication with healthcare workers can play an important role in older people's decisions to vaccinate. To support an informed decision about vaccination, healthcare workers should be able to identify the older person's knowledge gaps, needs and concerns. They should also be able to share and discuss information about the person's disease risk and disease severity; the vaccine's effectiveness and safety; and practical information about how the person can access vaccines. Therefore, healthcare workers need good communication skills and to actively keep up-to-date with the latest evidence. An understanding of their perceptions and experiences of this communication can help us train and support healthcare workers and design good communication strategies.

Objectives

To explore healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of communicating with older adults about vaccination.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and Scopus on 21 March 2020. We also searched Epistemonikos for related reviews, searched grey literature sources, and carried out reference checking and citation searching to identify additional studies. We searched for studies in any language.

Selection Criteria

We included qualitative studies and mixed-methods studies with an identifiable qualitative component. We included studies that explored the perceptions and experiences of healthcare workers and other health system staff towards communication with adults over the age of 50 years or their informal caregivers about vaccination.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data using a data extraction form designed for this review. We assessed methodological limitations using a list of predefined criteria. We extracted and assessed data regarding study authors' motivations for carrying out their study. We used a thematic synthesis approach to analyse and synthesise the evidence. We used the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in each finding. We examined each review finding to identify factors that may influence intervention implementation and we developed implications for practice.

Main Results

We included 11 studies in our review. Most studies explored healthcare workers' views and experiences about vaccination of older adults more broadly but also mentioned communication issues specifically. All studies were from high-income countries. The studies focused on doctors, nurses, pharmacists and others working in hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and nursing homes. These healthcare workers discussed different types of vaccines, including influenza, pneumococcal and herpes zoster vaccines. The review was carried out before COVID-19 vaccines were available. We downgraded our confidence in several of the findings from high confidence to moderate, low or very low confidence. One reason for this was that some findings were based on only small amounts of data. Another reason was that the findings were based on studies from only a few countries, making us unsure about the relevance of these findings to other settings. Healthcare workers reported that older adults asked about vaccination to different extents, ranging from not asking about vaccines at all, to great demand for information (high confidence finding). When the topic of vaccination was discussed, healthcare workers described a lack of information, and presence of misinformation, fears and concerns about vaccines among older adults (moderate confidence). The ways in which healthcare workers discussed vaccines with older adults appeared to be linked to what they saw as the aim of vaccination communication. Healthcare workers differed among themselves in their perceptions of this aim and about their own roles and the roles of older adults in vaccine decisions. Some healthcare workers thought it was important to provide information but emphasised the right and responsibility of older adults to decide for themselves. Others used information to persuade and convince older adults to vaccinate in order to increase 'compliance' and 'improve' vaccination rates, and in some cases to gain financial benefits. Other healthcare workers tailored their approach to what they believed the older adult needed or wanted (moderate confidence). Healthcare workers believed that older adults' decisions could be influenced by several factors, including the nature of the healthcare worker-patient relationship, the healthcare worker's status, and the extent to which healthcare workers led by example (low confidence). Our review also identified factors that are likely to influence how communication between healthcare workers and older adults take place. These included issues tied to healthcare workers' views and experiences regarding the diseases in question and the vaccines; as well as their views and experiences of the organisational and practical implementation of vaccine services.

Authors' Conclusions

There is little research focusing specifically on healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of communication with older adults about vaccination. The studies we identified suggest that healthcare workers differed among themselves in their perceptions about the aim of this communication and about the role of older adults in vaccine decisions. Based on these findings and the other findings in our review, we have developed a set of questions or prompts that may help health system planners or programme managers when planning or implementing strategies for vaccination communication between healthcare workers and older adults.

### Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline for immunizations in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-part 2: inactivated vaccines [^111Pu1WG]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The effectiveness and safety of vaccinations can be altered by immunosuppressive therapies, and perhaps by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) itself. These recommendations developed by the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology and endorsed by the American Gastroenterological Association, aim to provide guidance on immunizations in adult and pediatric patients with IBD. This publication focused on inactivated vaccines.

Methods

Systematic reviews evaluating the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of vaccines in patients with IBD, other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, and the general population were performed. Critical outcomes included mortality, vaccine-preventable diseases, and serious adverse events. Immunogenicity was considered a surrogate outcome for vaccine efficacy. Certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Key questions were developed through an iterative online platform, and voted on by a multidisciplinary group. Recommendations were formulated using the Evidence-to-Decision framework. Strong recommendation means that most patients should receive the recommended course of action, whereas a conditional recommendation means that different choices will be appropriate for different patients.

Results

Consensus was reached on 15 of 20 questions. Recommendations address the following vaccines: Haemophilus influenzae type b, recombinant zoster, hepatitis B, influenza, pneumococcus, meningococcus, tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis, and human papillomavirus. Most of the recommendations for patients with IBD are congruent with the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommendations for the general population, with the following exceptions. In patients with IBD, the panel suggested Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine for patients older than 5 years of age, recombinant zoster vaccine for adults younger than 50 year of age, and hepatitis B vaccine for adults without a risk factor. Consensus was not reached, and recommendations were not made for 5 statements, due largely to lack of evidence, including double-dose hepatitis B vaccine, timing of influenza immunization in patients on biologics, pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines in adult patients without risk factors, and human papillomavirus vaccine in patients aged 27–45 years.

Conclusions

Patients with IBD may be at increased risk of some vaccine-preventable diseases. Therefore, maintaining appropriate vaccination status in these patients is critical to optimize patient outcomes. In general, IBD is not a contraindication to the use of inactivated vaccines, but immunosuppressive therapy may reduce vaccine responses.

### ACG clinical guideline update: preventive care in inflammatory bowel disease [^111RQ2CG]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — pneumonia risk and pneumococcal vaccination: Patients with IBD are at increased risk for pneumonia relative to age-matched patients without IBD (adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR), 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.49–1.60). In all adult patients with IBD aged 50 and older and no prior pneumococcal vaccination, we suggest pneumococcal vaccination with PCV20 or PCV21 (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence). In adult patients with IBD between 19 and 49 years receiving immune-modifying therapy and with no prior pneumococcal vaccination, we suggest pneumococcal vaccination with PCV20 or PCV21 (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). In patients with IBD who have previously received pneumococcal vaccination and are either age 19–64 on immune-modifying therapy, or who are age 65 and older, should follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance for whether to receive additional pneumococcal vaccination with PCV20 or PCV21 (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence). Supporting data include a cohort study of 74,156 patients with IBD and 1,482,363 non-IBD controls showing increased invasive pneumococcal pneumonia, and a Veterans Affairs analysis in which PCV13 vaccination either alone or with PPSV23 was associated with a 5-fold decreased risk in severe pneumococcal disease. In 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed the PCV15 and PCV20 vaccines in adults, and most recently, PCV21 was approved for use in adults age 19 and older; these latest guidelines are relevant to adults ages 19–49 with immune-modifying therapies and to all adults with IBD age 50 and older. To optimize coverage and convenience, all adults with IBD regardless of age and immune suppression status who are naïve to pneumococcal vaccination should receive a single dose of PCV20 or PCV21, without the need for additional vaccines or boosters, and pneumococcal vaccination can be safely administered at the same time as influenza vaccination.

### The role American Thoracic Society healthcare providers have in immunization [^115Knj6C]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Routine immunization schedules include multiple vaccines recommended for adults, including boosters of childhood vaccines and others targeting older adults. In the United States, there are eight different vaccines recommended for adults who meet age requirements, including pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination for those aged 65 years or older and annual influenza vaccination for all adults; others are recommended in the presence of additional risk factors or other indications. The presence of specific adult immunization policies has not resulted in high vaccination uptake. In the United States during the 2019–2020 influenza season, influenza vaccination coverage was 51% among those aged 50–64 years, 70% among those 65 years and older, and 51% among persons 18–64 years with high-risk conditions. In the European Union, reported influenza vaccination coverage among older adults ranged from 13% to 58% and among persons with high-risk conditions from 25% to 57% during the 2016–2017 influenza season.

Economic Analysis

Three economic models (Tulane, Merck, and Pittsburgh models) assessed the cost-effectiveness of using PCV21 in adults who are currently recommended to receive PCV, §§§ adults aged 50–64 years, and adults aged 19–49 years. For each model, the primary health outcome used to assess cost-effectiveness was the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).

Across the three models, base case estimates of using PCV21 instead of PCV20 for adults who are currently recommended to receive a PCV ranged from being cost-saving **** to having a cost of $58,000 per QALY gained. In the Tulane model, replacing PCV20 with PCV21 in adults who currently have a risk-based vaccine indication resulted in fewer QALYs gained when the proportion of serotype 4 disease among all pneumococcal disease cases was ≥ 35%. Base case estimates of using PCV21 in adults aged 50–64 years ranged from $3,000 to $270,000 per QALY gained. Economic models that assessed cost-effectiveness of using PCV21 among adults aged 19–49 years were the least economically favorable among the three groups considered.

Summary of respiratory vaccine recommendations for patients with heart disease — Influenza is annual for persons aged ≥ 6 mo; nasal vaccine not recommended for patients aged > 50 y, and specific vaccines are recommended for those aged ≥ 65 y. Pneumococcal is 1-time vaccination with PCV20 or PCV21 for adults aged ≥ 19 y, while other vaccines require 2 vaccinations. COVID-19 guidance lists initial and 2024–2025 vaccine for persons aged ≥ 6 mo, noting that recommendations for annual vaccination may change as circulating virus biology changes. RSV is 1-time vaccination for adults aged ≥ 60 y. Zoster requires 2 doses of recombinant zoster vaccine 2–6 mo apart for those adults aged ≥ 50 y. Other vaccines are recommended by the CDC for all adults (regardless of heart disease).

### Primary care physicians' struggle with current adult pneumococcal vaccine recommendations [^114jhitb]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

In 2012, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in series with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) for at-risk adults ≥ 19; in 2014, it expanded this recommendation to adults ≥ 65. Primary care physicians' practice, knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding these recommendations are unknown.

Methods

Primary care physicians throughout the U.S. were surveyed by E-mail and post from December 2015 to January 2016.

Results

Response rate was 66% (617 of 935). Over 95% of respondents reported routinely assessing adults' vaccination status and recommending both vaccines. A majority found the current recommendations to be clear (50% "very clear", 38% "somewhat clear"). Twenty percent found the upfront cost of purchasing PCV13, lack of insurance coverage, inadequate reimbursement, and difficulty determining vaccination history to be "major barriers" to giving these vaccines. Knowledge of recommendations varied, with 83% identifying the PCV13 recommendation for adults ≥ 65 and only 21% identifying the recommended interval between PCV13 and PPSV23 in an individual < 65 at increased risk.

Conclusions

Almost all surveyed physicians reported recommending both pneumococcal vaccines, but a disconnect seems to exist between perceived clarity and knowledge of the recommendations. Optimal implementation of these recommendations will require addressing knowledge gaps and reported barriers.

### Intervals between PCV13 and PPSV23 vaccines: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^115Tky3Q]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Two pneumococcal vaccines are currently licensed for use in the United States: the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13 [Prevnar 13, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc.]) and the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23 [Pneumovax 23, Merck and Co, Inc.]). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) currently recommends that a dose of PCV13 be followed by a dose of PPSV23 in all adults aged ≥ 65 years who have not previously received pneumococcal vaccine and in persons aged ≥ 2 years who are at high risk for pneumococcal disease because of underlying medical conditions (Table) (1–4). The recommended intervals between PCV13 and PPSV23 given in series differ by age and risk group and the order in which the two vaccines are given (1–4).

### Age-stratified burden of pneumococcal community acquired pneumonia in hospitalised Canadian adults from 2010 to 2015 [^113S5Pon]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Key messages

To help make informed recommendations for adult immunisation, the Serious Outcomes Surveillance Network of the Canadian Immunisation Research Network performed surveillance prospectively with aims to characterise by age the burden of pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia (pCAP) in hospitalised Canadian adults and the proportion of pCAP that is attributed to 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) serotypes.
Adults aged ≥ 50 years accounted for 74% of pCAP attributed to PCV13 serotypes, compared with 41% in adults aged ≥ 65 years for whom a vaccine recommendation already exists.
These data, along with the clinical burden of pCAP in adults aged 50–64 years, argue the value of immunising adults aged ≥ 50 years.

### Expanded recommendations for use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines among adults aged ≥ 50 years: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2024 [^114boNjL]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Medium credibility.

In June 2024, ACIP recommended PCV21 as an option for adults who are recommended to receive PCV and proposed a review of available evidence to determine whether data supported lowering the age-based recommendation to ≥ 50 years for all recommended PCVs. The approval of PCV21, which was specifically developed to target pneumococcal serotypes that commonly cause disease in adults (Figure), was seen as a unique opportunity to reduce pneumococcal disease incidence and health disparities among U.S. adults. This report summarizes the evidence considered by ACIP regarding the expansion of the age-based recommendation to include adults aged 50–64 years, highlighting considerations of pneumococcal disease incidence and mortality, health disparities, and resource use.

ACG Clinical Guideline Update — vaccinations in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) states: In all adult patients with IBD aged 50 and older and no prior pneumococcal vaccination, we suggest pneumococcal vaccination with PCV20 or PCV21 (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence). In adult patients with IBD between 19 and 49 y receiving immune-modifying therapy who have not received pneumococcal vaccination, we suggest pneumococcal vaccination with PCV20 or PCV21 (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). In patients with IBD who have previously received pneumococcal vaccination and are either age 19–64 on immune-modifying therapy, or who are age 65 and older, should follow CDC guidance for whether to receive additional pneumococcal vaccination with PCV20 or PCV21 (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence). In all adults 50 and older with IBD, we suggest vaccination against herpes zoster with the 2-dose inactivated recombinant herpes zoster vaccine (Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). In adults 19 and above with IBD on immune-modifying therapy or planning to start therapy, we suggest vaccination against herpes zoster with the 2-dose inactive recombinant herpes zoster vaccine (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). In adults with IBD, we suggest vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in accordance with national guidelines (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). We suggest that a live rotavirus vaccine may be offered in children with in-utero exposure to biologic therapy (Conditional recommendation with very low certainty of evidence).

### Cost-effectiveness of vaccination against invasive pneumococcal disease among people 50 through 64 years of age: role of comorbid conditions and race [^116ocefa]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines are increasingly recommending preventive services starting at 50 years of age, and policymakers are considering such a recommendation for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination. The finding that pneumococcal vaccination is cost-saving for people 65 years of age or older raises the question of the vaccination's implications for other older adults, especially black people, whose disease incidence exceeds that of nonblack people, and those with high-risk conditions.

Objective

To assess the implications of vaccinating black and nonblack people 50 through 64 years of age against invasive pneumococcal disease.

Design

Cost-effectiveness analysis.

Data Sources

Published literature for vaccination effectiveness and cost estimates; data on disease incidence and case-fatality rates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Target Population

Hypothetical cohort 50 through 64 years of age with the 1995 U.S. age distribution.

Time Horizon

Lifetime.

Perspective

Societal.

Intervention

Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination compared with no vaccination.

Outcome Measures

Incremental medical costs and health effects, in quality-adjusted life-years per vaccinee.

Results Of Base-Case Analysis

Vaccination saved medical costs and improved health among high-risk black people (27.55 dollars savings per vaccinee) and nonblack people (5.92 dollars savings per vaccinee), excluding survivors' future costs. For low-risk black and nonblack people and the overall general population, vaccination cost 2477 dollars, 8195 dollars, and 3434 dollars, respectively, to gain 1 year of healthy life.

Results Of Sensitivity Analysis

Excluding survivors' future costs, in the general immunocompetent population, cost per quality-adjusted life-year in global worst-case results ranged from 21 513 dollars for black people to 68 871 dollars for nonblack people; in the high-risk population, cost ranged from 11 548 dollars for black people to 39 000 dollars for nonblack people. In the global best case, vaccination was cost-saving for black and nonblack people in the general immunocompetent and high-risk populations, excluding survivors' future costs. The cost-effectiveness range was narrower in probabilistic sensitivity analyses, with 95% probabilistic intervals ranging from cost-saving to 1594 dollars for black people and from cost-saving to 12 273 dollars for nonblack people in the general immunocompetent population. Costs per quality-adjusted life-year for low-risk people with case-fatality rates from 1998 were 2477 dollars for black people and 8195 dollars for nonblack people, excluding survivors' medical costs.

Conclusions

These results support the current recommendation to vaccinate high-risk people and provide useful information for considering extending the recommendation to the general population 50 through 64 years of age. Lack of evidence about the effectiveness of revaccination for people 65 years of age or older, when disease risks are higher, argues for further research to guide vaccination policy.

### Vaccines for women age 50 and older [^114DqWTt]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

In the absence of studies of the protective efficacy after revaccination and insufficient safety studies by age, advisory committees have been reluctant to issue firm directives. To date, routine revaccination is not recommended for immunocompetent persons who were first vaccinated > 65 years of age. However, for persons who were first vaccinated before 65 years of age for reason of increased risk, a single revaccination is recommended. In the absence of data, some practicing physicians, given the overall good safety profile and low cost of PPV, have chosen to revaccinate elderly patients at 5- to 10-year intervals as a prudent response to the increasing rates of pneumococcal disease and deaths with age.

Additional questions about PPV recommendations exist. Should the vaccine indications be broadened to include those who smoke cigarettes, now shown to be a major risk factor for invasive pneumococcal disease, and minority groups who have 2–10 times more invasive pneumococcal disease than that of the general population? Should the age for universal vaccination of adults be lowered to 50 years of age on the basis of the observations that ≈30% of adults 50–64 years of age have risk factors for which PPV is indicated? Approximately 18% of the U.S population is made up of minority groups who have high rates of pneumococcal disease, and approximately one quarter of Americans 50–64 years of age smoke cigarettes. An added advantage to lowering the age of universal PPV vaccination to 50 years of age would be the "harmonization" of the adult pneumococcal vaccination schedule with the recommendations for influenza vaccine, thereby simplifying the system and hopefully improving the poor implementation rates of condition-based recommendations.

Finally, the development of a seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for infants and young children has been a major advance that provides > 90% protection against invasive pneumococcal disease in young children. Since young children are an important reservoir of pneumococcal carriage and spread it to others, vaccinating young children has provided a beneficial herd immunity that results in substantial reductions of pneumococcal disease in other children and adults. Developing a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine suitable for adults has been difficult.

Pneumococcal Vaccines and Administration

One PPSV and three PCVs are licensed and available for use in the United States (Table 1). These vaccines are PPSV23 (Pneumovax23), a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine; PCV13 (Prevnar13), a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; PCV15 (Vaxneuvance), 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; and PCV20 (Prevnar20), a 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. The PPSV and PCV vaccines induce immune responses in different ways. Studies in mice have found that the polysaccharide vaccine induces a T-cell independent immune response and stimulates immediate B-cell responses. As a result, B-cells differentiate to plasma cells that produce antibodies. However, a T-cell independent immune response does not result in creation of serotype-specific memory B-cells. On the other hand, conjugate vaccines induce a T-cell dependent response. The polysaccharide antigen binds to the B-cells, and the peptides from the carrier protein are presented to carrier-peptide–specific helper T-cells. These helper T-cells enhance the immune response by the B-cells, and memory B-cells also are created. All PCVs use CRM197 (genetically detoxified diphtheria toxin) as a carrier protein.

### Epidemiology of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae infections in the United States, 1995–1998: opportunities for prevention in the conjugate vaccine era [^111YxxKX]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Context

Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is recommended for elderly persons and adults with certain chronic illnesses. Additionally, a recently licensed pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine has been recommended for use in young children and could dramatically change the epidemiology of pneumococcal disease.

Objectives

To assess pneumococcal disease burden in the United States, estimate the potential impact of new vaccines, and identify gaps in vaccine recommendations.

Design and Setting

Analysis of data from the Active Bacterial Core Surveillance (ABCs)/Emerging Infections Program Network, an active, population-based system in 9 states.

Patients

A total of 15 860 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease occurring between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1998.

Main Outcome Measures

Age- and race-specific pneumoccocal disease incidence rates per 100 000 persons, case-fatality rates, and vaccine preventability.

Results

In 1998, overall incidence was 23.2 cases per 100 000, corresponding to an estimated 62 840 cases in the United States. Incidence was highest among children younger than 2 years (166.9) and adults aged 65 years or older (59.7). Incidence among blacks was 2.6 times higher than among whites (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4–2.8). Overall, 28.6% of case-patients were at least 65 years old and 85.9% of cases in this age group were due to serotypes included in the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine; 19.3% of case-patients were younger than 2 years and 82.2% of cases in this age group were due to serotypes included in the 7-valent conjugate vaccine. Among patients aged 2 to 64 years, 50.6% had a vaccine indication as defined by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). The case-fatality rate among patients aged 18 to 64 years with an ACIP indication was 12.1% compared with 5.4% for those without an indication (relative risk, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.7–2.9).

Conclusions

Young children, elderly persons, and black persons of all ages are disproportionately affected by invasive pneumococcal disease. Current ACIP recommendations do not address a subset of persons aged 18 to 64 years but do include those at highest risk for death from invasive pneumococcal disease.

### Use of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine among adults aged ≥ 65 years: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^113X8fZC]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

What is currently recommended?

In 2010, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) approved revised recommendations that all persons should be vaccinated with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) at age 65 years. In 2012, ACIP made recommendations for use of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and PPSV23 for adults aged ≥ 19 years with immunocompromising conditions.

Why are the recommendations being modified now?

PCV13 was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in late 2011 for use among adults aged ≥ 50 years. In June 2014, the results of a randomized placebo-controlled trial showing efficacy of PCV13 against community-acquired pneumonia among approximately 85,000 adults aged ≥ 65 years became available and were presented to ACIP. The evidence supporting PCV13 vaccination of adults was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and determined to be type 2 (moderate level of evidence); the recommendation was designated as a Category A recommendation.

For new ACIP recommendations in this report, a systematic literature search that was performed in February 2021 was updated to review available evidence on the immunogenicity and safety of PCV15 and PCV20 among adults. GRADE was only used for evidence on PCV20 use in adults who previously received PCV13. To identify additional literature published during March 2021–March 2022, PubMed Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Epistemonikos, and Cochrane library databases were searched using the previous search terms. Search results were supplemented by a search of ClinicalTrials.gov using the term "20-valent pneumococcal vaccine, adults" and PubMed Medline using the terms "PCV20" or "20-valent pneumococcal vaccine". Unpublished data from trials identified through ClinicalTrials.gov but not yet publicly available were provided by the vaccine manufacturers. Evidence on safety and immunogenicity of PCV20 among adults who previously received a pneumococcal vaccine was assessed using GRADE.

On August 13, 2014, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine use of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13 [Prevnar 13, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc.]) among adults aged ≥ 65 years. PCV13 should be administered in series with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23 [Pneumovax23, Merck & Co, Inc.]), the vaccine currently recommended for adults aged ≥ 65 years. PCV13 was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late 2011 for use among adults aged ≥ 50 years. In June 2014, the results of a randomized placebo-controlled trial evaluating efficacy of PCV13 for preventing community-acquired pneumonia among approximately 85,000 adults aged ≥ 65 years with no prior pneumococcal vaccination history (CAPiTA trial) became available and were presented to ACIP. The evidence supporting PCV13 vaccination of adults was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and determined to be type 2 (moderate level of evidence); the recommendation was categorized as a Category A recommendation. This report outlines the new recommendations for PCV13 use, provides guidance for use of PCV13 and PPSV23 among adults aged ≥ 65 years, and summarizes the evidence considered by ACIP to make this recommendation.

Safety and Immunogenicity Studies

Safety and immunogenicity of Prevnar 13 is supported by 6 clinical studies. Study 66evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of Prevnar 13 in adults 18 through 64 years of age who had not received a previous dose of pneumococcal vaccine. Adults 18 through 59 years of age received a single dose of Prevnar 13, and adults 60 through 64 years of age received a single dose of Prevnar 13 or PPSV23.

Study 7 was randomized and compared the safety and immunogenicity of Prevnar 13 with PPSV23 as a single dose in adults ≥ 70 years vaccinated with PPSV23 (≥ 5 years prior to enrollment).7Study 8 was randomized and evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of Prevnar 13 and PPSV23 in different sequential order in PPSV23 naive adults aged 60 through 64 years8.

One clinical safety study9(Study 9) of Prevnar 13, conducted in PPSV23 previously vaccinated (≥ 3 years prior to enrollment) adults aged ≥ 68 years was a single arm study. Two studies, one in the US10(Study 10) in adults aged 50 through 59 years and the other in Europe11(Study 11) in adults aged ≥ 65 years, evaluated the concomitant administration of Prevnar 13 with inactivated influenza vaccine, trivalent (Fluarix, A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B, Fall 2007/Spring 2008: IIV3) in these two age groups in PPSV23 unvaccinated adults.

### Use of pneumococcal disease epidemiology to set policy and prevent disease during 20 years of the emerging infections program [^115e2dFf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Since the inception of ABCs, numerous publications have drawn heavily on primary analysis of ABCs pneumococcal data, and many others have incorporated secondary analyses of data published in peer-reviewed literature. Some of the most influential outputs have focused on basic descriptive epidemiology. For example, EIP/ABCs data on antimicrobial resistance among pneumococci causing IPD helped shape treatment policy for pneumonia and meningitis. A seminal paper containing data collected during 1995–1998 highlighted the increased risk for disease among children < 2 years of age and adults ≥ 65 years of age, as well as substantial racial disparity (greater risk for black persons vs. white persons) in every age group. In addition, the analysis showed that 59% of disease among adults 18–64 years of age occurred in persons who had an indication for receiving 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23). However, vaccine coverage was and remains unacceptably low. An estimated 48,000 cases (76%) of IPD and 5,300 deaths (87%) occurred annually among persons who were eligible for pneumococcal vaccines at that time. This analysis, which was conducted as pneumococcal conjugate vaccines were undergoing clinical trials, helped to highlight the need to include the conjugate vaccine in the US pediatric vaccine schedule and to improve use of PPV23 among adults.

Having a solid surveillance infrastructure in place has provided major opportunities for EIPs to conduct special studies. One of the earliest with key policy implications was the Preventability Study, which was designed to evaluate the extent to which addition of proposed new Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) indications for PPV23 might increase the proportion of IPD preventable through better immunization coverage. In 2000, the age for universal influenza vaccination was reduced from 65 to 50 years of age. This reduction raised the question of whether PPV23, which is frequently given to adults along with influenza vaccine, should also be administered to adults > 50 years of age. In the Preventability Study, EIP investigators interviewed 1,705 adults who had recovered from IPD to identify all providers from whom they had received care. The EIPs then determined which patients had already received PPV23 and, among those who had not, which patients had at > 1 ACIP indication for PPV23. Ultimately, the existing recommendations were proven to capture most adults with IPD, and the extant data were not sufficient to support reducing the age of universal vaccination with PPV23.

Regarding preventative measures for pneumococcal vaccination in adults, more specifically with respect to schedules, CDC 2022 guidelines recommend to offer 1 dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (either PCV20 or PCV15) in adults aged ≥ 65 years not previously received pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or if previous vaccination history is unknown.

Future Directions

CDC and ACIP will continue to assess safety of PCV15 and PCV20 use in adults, monitor the impact of implementing these new recommendations, and assess postimplementation pneumococcal disease trends. These vaccines were licensed on the basis of safety and immunogenicity data, and correlates of protection have not been established for adults.

Multiple factors might influence future pneumococcal vaccination strategies for adults. Unlike PCV13, the new PCVs (PCV15 and PCV20) were first licensed by FDA for use in adults. PCV15 use in children was approved by FDA and recommended by ACIP in June 2022, and PCV20 use was approved by FDA in April 2023 and recommended by ACIP in June 2023. Similar to observations with PCV13, indirect effects from use of these new PCVs in children might reduce the added benefit of PCV15 or PCV20 vaccination in adults in the future. In addition, new, higher-valency pneumococcal vaccines for adults have completed phase II clinical trials, and these vaccines might become available for use in upcoming years. Furthermore, the long-term impact of COVID-19 on pneumococcal disease burden in the United States is unknown.

Adult pneumococcal vaccine recommendations have become more complicated as more pneumococcal vaccines have become available for use. Pneumococcal vaccine coverage, especially among adults aged < 65 years with underlying conditions that increase the risk for pneumococcal disease, remains suboptimal. Future availability of vaccines that cover broader serotypes might provide an opportunity to simplify the adult pneumococcal vaccine recommendations and increase vaccine coverage or expand the risk-based recommendations to maximize protection against pneumococcal disease. ACIP will review and update recommendations as new data become available.

### Pneumococcal disease prevention among adults: strategies for the use of pneumococcal vaccines [^111pyufi]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Use of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines among children in the U.S. since 2000 has dramatically reduced pneumococcal disease burden among adults. Significant vaccine-preventable morbidity and mortality from pneumococcal infections still remains, especially among older adults. The U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recently recommended the routine use of both pneumococcal conjugate (PCV13) and polysaccharide vaccines (PPSV23) for adults ≥ 65 years. These recommendations were based on the remaining burden of illness among adults and the importance of non-bacteremic pneumonia prevention in light of new evidence confirming the efficacy of PCV13 to prevent pneumococcal pneumonia among older adults. This paper reviews the evidence that led ACIP to make recommendations for PCV13 and PPSV23 use among adults, and highlights potential gaps to be addressed by future studies to inform adult vaccination policy. The changing epidemiology of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumonia should be closely monitored to evaluate the effectiveness and continued utility of the current vaccination strategy, and to identify future directions for pneumococcal disease prevention among older adults.

### Optimal age targeting for pneumococcal vaccination in older adults; a modelling study [^112poLAw]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) risk increases with age for older adults whereas the population size benefiting from pneumococcal vaccines and robustness of immunogenic response to vaccination decline. We estimate how demographics, vaccine efficacy/effectiveness (VE), and waning VE impact on optimal age for a single-dose pneumococcal vaccination. Age- and vaccine-serotype-specific IPD cases from routine surveillance of adults ≥ 55 years old (y), ≥ 4-years after infant-pneumococcal vaccine introduction and before 2020, and VE data from prior studies were used to estimate IPD incidence and waning VE which were then combined in a cohort model of vaccine impact. In Brazil, Malawi, South Africa and England 51, 51, 54 and 39% of adults older than 55y were younger than 65years old, with a smaller share of annual IPD cases reported among < 65years old in England (4,657; 20%) than Brazil (186; 45%), Malawi (4; 63%), or South Africa (134, 48%). Vaccination at 55years in Brazil, Malawi, and South Africa, and at 70years in England had the greatest potential for IPD prevention. Here, we show that in low/middle-income countries, pneumococcal vaccines may prevent a substantial proportion of residual IPD burden if administered earlier in adulthood than is typical in high-income countries.

### Incremental cost-effectiveness of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for adults age 50 years and older in the United States [^117PtxNh]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Recently released results from a randomized controlled trial have shown that 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) is efficacious against vaccine-type nonbacteremic pneumonia in adults.

Objective

We examined the incremental cost-effectiveness of adding PCV13 to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) adult immunization schedule.

Methods

We used a probabilistic model following cohorts of 50-, 60-, or 65-year-olds. We used separate vaccination coverage and disease incidence data for healthy and high-risk adults. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were determined for each potential vaccination strategy.

Results

In the base case scenario, our model indicated that adding PCV13 at age 65 or replacing 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) at age 65 with PCV13 provided more value for money than adding PCV13 at ages 50 or 60. After projections of six additional years of herd protection from the childhood immunization program were incorporated, we found adding PCV13 dominated replacing PPSV23. For a cohort of 65-year-olds in 2013, the cost of adding PCV13 at age 65 to the schedule was $62,065 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, which rose to $272,621 after 6 years of projected herd protection.

Conclusion

The addition of one dose of PCV13 for adults appears to have a cost-effectiveness ratio comparable to other vaccination interventions in the short run, though anticipated herd protection from the childhood immunization program may dramatically increase the cost per QALY after only a few years.

### Changing epidemiology of invasive pneumococcal disease among older adults in the era of pediatric pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [^112adK8U]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

A conjugate vaccine targeting 7 pneumococcal serotypes was licensed for young children in 2000. In contrast to the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine used in adults, the 7-valent conjugate vaccine affects pneumococcal carriage and transmission. Early after its introduction, incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease declined among older adults, a group at high risk for pneumococcal disease.

Objective

To determine among adults aged 50 years or older whether incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease, disease characteristics, or the spectrum of patients acquiring these illnesses have changed over the 4 years since pneumococcal conjugate vaccine licensure.

Design, Setting, and Population

Population-based surveillance of invasive pneumococcal disease in 8 US geographic areas (total population, 18,813,000), 1998–2003.

Main Outcome Measures

Incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease by pneumococcal serotype and other characteristics; frequency among case patients of comorbid conditions and other factors influencing mortality.

Results

Incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease among adults aged 50 years or older declined 28% (95% confidence interval [CI] -31% to -24%), from 40.8 cases/100,000 in 1998–1999 to 29.4 in 2002–2003. Among those aged 65 years or older, the 2002–2003 rate (41.7 cases/100,000) was lower than the Healthy People 2010 goal (42 cases/100,000). Among adults aged 50 years or older, incidence of disease caused by the 7 conjugate vaccine serotypes declined 55% (95% CI, -58% to -51%) from 22.4 to 10.2 cases/100,000. In contrast, disease caused by any of the 16 serotypes only in polysaccharide vaccine did not change, and disease caused by serotypes not in either vaccine increased somewhat, from 6.0 to 6.8 cases/100,000 (13%; 95% CI, 1% to 27%). Between 1998–1999 and 2002–2003, the proportion of case-patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection increased from 1.7% (47/2737) to 5.6% (124/2231) (P < .001), and those with any comorbid condition that is an indication for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination increased from 62.3% (1842/2955) to 72.0% (1721/2390) (P < .001).

Conclusions

Our findings indicate that use of conjugate vaccine in children has substantially benefited older adults. However, persons with certain comorbid conditions may benefit less than healthier persons from the indirect effects of the new vaccine.

### Pneumococcal vaccine for adults aged ≥ 19 years: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices, United States, 2023 [^115hN6YA]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

ACIP's Pneumococcal Vaccines Work Group included voting members of ACIP; representatives of ACIP ex officio and liaison organizations; and scientific consultants with expertise in public health, vaccinology, medical specialties (e.g. family practice, geriatrics, infectious disease, internal medicine, and pediatrics), vaccine research, and assessments of vaccine efficacy and safety. The work group reviewed and discussed topics such as pneumococcal disease epidemiology, pneumococcal vaccine safety, immunogenicity of newly licensed vaccines, efficacy and effectiveness of existing pneumococcal vaccines, pneumococcal vaccine coverage, program feasibility, health equity, and cost-effectiveness. This report updates and replaces previously published ACIP recommendations for pneumococcal vaccine use in adults (,–). The work group organized, evaluated, and discussed information to create the recommendations using the Evidence to Recommendation (EtR) framework and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). Data used for general clarifications to the recommendations were summarized based on findings from expert opinion of the Pneumococcal Vaccines Work Group and literature searches that were completed October 17, 2022, and updated before publication. All studies yielding pertinent information were deemed relevant for inclusion.

In 2010, ACIP adopted the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence after a systematic review of literature. Subsequent ACIP recommendations made using the GRADE approach include the following: routine use of PCV13 and PPSV23 for immunocompromised adults; routine use of PCV13 in adults aged ≥ 65 years; shared clinical decision-making regarding use of PCV13 for adults aged ≥ 65 years who do not have an immunocompromising condition, a CSF leak, or a cochlear implant; use of PCV15 or PCV20 in adults aged 19–64 years with certain underlying medical conditions or other risk factors and all adults aged ≥ 65 years who have not previously received a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or whose vaccination history is unknown; and the use of PCV20 in adults who previously received PCV13. GRADE evidence tables for these recommendations are available.

Epidemiology of Pneumococcal Disease Among Adults Aged ≥ 65 Years

Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) remains a leading infectious cause of serious illness, including bacteremia, meningitis, and pneumonia, among older adults in the United States. Use of a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) since 2000 and PCV13 since 2010 among children in the United States has reduced pneumococcal infections directly and indirectly among children, and indirectly among adults. By 2013, the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by serotypes unique to PCV13 among adults aged ≥ 65 years had declined by approximately 50% compared with 2010, when PCV13 replaced PCV7 in the pediatric immunization schedule. However, in 2013 an estimated 13,500 cases of IPD occurred among adults aged ≥ 65 years. Approximately, 20%–25% of IPD cases and 10% of community-acquired pneumonia cases in adults aged ≥ 65 years are caused by PCV13 serotypes and are potentially preventable with the use of PCV13 in this population.

Introduction

Pneumococcal infections are caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), a gram-positive, facultative anaerobic bacterium. Pneumococcus can colonize the upper respiratory tract, most commonly in young children, and is transmitted to others through contact with respiratory droplets from a person with pneumococcal colonization in the upper respiratory tract. Certain persons with pneumococcal colonization might develop invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). IPD is infection of normally sterile sites, including pneumonia with bacteremia, meningitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and bacteremia without a focus of infection; examples of noninvasive disease include pneumonia without bacteremia, sinusitis, or otitis media. In adults, pneumococcal pneumonia is the most common type of pneumococcal disease, and pneumococcus is the most common bacterial cause of pneumonia that results in hospitalization.

Pneumococci are classified into serotypes depending on their capsular polysaccharide, which is a main virulence factor for pneumococcus. At least 100 pneumococcal serotypes were documented as of 2020. During 2018–2019, approximately 60%–75% of all IPD in adults was caused by the 24 pneumococcal serotypes that were included in the formulations of commercially available polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (PCV) or pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) vaccines (i.e. PCV13, PCV15, PCV20, and PPSV23) (Figure). Current pneumococcal vaccines use the pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides as antigens to generate serotype-specific antibodies, which facilitate serotype-specific clearance of pneumococci through opsonophagocytosis. PPSV23 (Pneumovax23) is a 23-valent vaccine that has been recommended for use since the 1980s for persons aged ≥ 2 years with certain underlying medical conditions and for adults aged ≥ 65 years (Table 1) (Figure). In 2000, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended the use of PCV7 (Prevnar), a 7-valent vaccine that was the first PCV, in all children aged < 2 years. Use of PCV7 in children not only reduced the incidence of pneumococcal disease in those directly recommend for vaccination but also, through indirect effects, in older children and adults who were not recommended for vaccination. In 2010, PCV13 (Prevnar13), a 13-valent PCV, replaced PCV7 (no longer manufactured) and was recommended for routine use in all children aged 2–59 months. In 2012, ACIP recommended PCV13 in addition to PPSV23 for use in adults aged ≥ 19 years with an immunocompromising condition, functional or anatomic asplenia, a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, or a cochlear implant. In 2014, ACIP recommended routine use of PCV13 in series with PPSV23 for all adults aged ≥ 65 years. This recommendation was supported by a large, randomized controlled trial (RCT) among pneumococcal vaccine–naïve, community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 65 years in the Netherlands that demonstrated efficacy of PCV13 against noninvasive pneumococcal pneumonia. In June 2019 ACIP voted to no longer routinely recommend PCV13 for all adults aged ≥ 65 years and, instead, to recommend PCV13 on the basis of shared clinical decision-making for adults aged ≥ 65 years who do not have an immunocompromising condition, a CSF leak, or a cochlear implant. The rationale for this decision was based on additional years of data that found minimal changes in the incidence of pneumococcal disease preventable by PCV13 among adults after the PCV13 recommendation for all adults aged ≥ 65 years was implemented and on the historically low levels of PCV13-type disease attributed to the indirect effects of pediatric PCV13 use. Although anatomic or functional asplenia, chronic renal failure, and nephrotic syndrome might not be considered immunocompromising, these conditions are included under immunocompromising conditions for pneumococcal vaccine recommendations because of the similarities in the vaccine recommendations.

Selection of PCV in Populations with High Proportions of Serotype 4 Pneumococcal Disease

In many U.S. settings, PCV21 is expected to cover more circulating pneumococcal strains than do other recommended PCVs. In certain populations in which ≥ 30% of pneumococcal disease is due to serotype 4, pneumococcal vaccines that include serotype 4 (PCV20 alone or PCV15 and PPSV23 in series) (Figure) are expected to provide broader serotype coverage against locally circulating strains than does PCV21 (Box).

Clinical guidance on selection of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in communities with high percentages of serotype 4 pneumococcal disease — United States, 2024

PCV21 contains eight pneumococcal serotypes that are not included in previously recommended pneumococcal vaccines (i.e. PCV15, PCV20, and PPSV23). However, PCV21 does not contain certain pneumococcal serotypes that are contained in previously recommended pneumococcal vaccines, one of which is pneumococcal serotype 4.
In certain adult populations in the western United States, high percentages (i.e. ≥ 30%) of IPD caused by serotype 4 have occurred. The available IPD serotype data from CDC's Active Bacterial Core surveillance, as well as similar surveillance from Alaska and Navajo Nation, indicate that this serotype is particularly prevalent in Alaska, Colorado, Navajo Nation, New Mexico, and Oregon. Serotype 4 IPD occurs across age groups; however, cases are frequently observed among adults aged < 65 years who have underlying conditions, such as alcoholism, chronic lung disease, cigarette smoking, homelessness, and injection drug use. In such populations in these geographic areas, other recommended pneumococcal vaccines (e.g. PCV20 alone or both PCV15 and PPSV23) are expected to provide broader serotype coverage against locally circulating strains compared with PCV21.
The percentages of serotype 4 IPD cases in other areas of the western United States without IPD surveillance are currently unknown. IPD surveillance from other geographic areas in the United States (e.g. midwestern, eastern, and southern regions) has not detected significant percentages of serotype 4.
This clinical guidance will be reviewed and updated as pneumococcal disease epidemiology evolves.

### Pneumococcal vaccination: current and future issues [^1168wYyk]. The European Respiratory Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae remains a major global health burden meaning the development of effective vaccines is urgently needed. The current 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine has been shown to prevent pneumococcal pneumonia in immunocompetent young adults, but not in elderly persons. However, in prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease, the vaccine is efficacious in the elderly and may also be effective in some groups of immunocompromised patients. The polysaccharide vaccine is, therefore, recommended in all older (≥ 55–65 yrs of age) adults and in young children (> 2 yrs of age) who have a high risk for pneumococcal disease. Revaccination can be safely performed and is recommended 5 yrs after the first dose. In children < 2 yrs of age, the new polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines, including 7–11 serotypes, seem to be effective in the prevention of invasive disease, severe pneumonia and serotype-specific (and vaccine-related types) otitis media. The low serotype coverage, need for repeated doses, and high price, may decrease the usefulness of the new conjugates. However, the included serotypes correspond to those most often associated with penicillin resistance and vaccination is, therefore, a possible tool in limiting the spread of antibiotic-resistant pneumococci.

Introduction

Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a common bacterial cause of respiratory tract infections, bacteremia, and meningitis. Widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) in children reduced the incidence of pneumococcal disease, both among children through direct effects and among older children and adults who have not received PCV through indirect effects (i.e. reduction in disease incidence in the population because of decreased transmission of pneumococcus from children). However, persons with underlying conditions or factors that increase their risk for pneumococcal disease (risk conditions) * and older adults experience higher pneumococcal disease rates. In addition, racial disparities in pneumococcal disease incidence persist, including higher rates among non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) adults.

Before its October meeting, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended receipt of a single dose of PCV for all adults aged ≥ 65 years and those aged 19–64 years with a risk condition who have not received PCV or whose vaccination history is unknown. Options included either 20-valent PCV (PCV20; Prevnar20; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals) or 21-valent PCV (PCV21; CAPVAXIVE; Merck Sharp & Dohme) alone, or 15-valent PCV (PCV15; VAXNEUVANCE; Merck Sharp & Dohme) followed by 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23; Pneumovax23, Merck Sharp & Dohme). Additional recommendations are applicable for use of PCV20 or PCV21 for adults who commenced their pneumococcal vaccination series with 13-valent PCV (PCV13; Prevnar13, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals).

### Age-stratified burden of pneumococcal community acquired pneumonia in hospitalised Canadian adults from 2010 to 2015 [^1129vwC5]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Background

In Canada, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) is recommended in childhood, in individuals at high risk of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and in healthy adults aged ≥ 65 years for protection against vaccine-type IPD and pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia (pCAP). Since vaccine recommendations in Canada include both age-based and risk-based guidance, this study aimed to describe the burden of vaccine-preventable pCAP in hospitalised adults by age.

Methods

Surveillance for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in hospitalised adults was performed prospectively from 2010 to 2015. CAP was radiologically confirmed, and pCAP was identified using blood and sputum culture and urine antigen testing. Patient demographics and outcomes were stratified by age (16–49, 50–64, ≥ 65 and ≥ 50 years).

Results

Of 6666/8802 CAP cases tested, 830 (12.5%) had pCAP, and 418 (6.3%) were attributed to a PCV13 serotype. Of PCV13 pCAP, 41% and 74% were in adults aged ≥ 65and ≥ 50 years, respectively. Compared with non-pCAP controls, pCAP cases aged ≥ 50 years were more likely to be admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) and to require mechanical ventilation. Older adults with pCAP were less likely to be admitted to ICU or required mechanical ventilation, given their higher mortality and goals of care. Of pCAP deaths, 67% and 90% were in the ≥ 65and ≥ 50age cohorts, respectively.

Conclusions

Adults hospitalised with pCAP in the age cohort of 50–64 years contribute significantly to the burden of illness, suggesting that an age-based recommendation for adults aged ≥ 50 years should be considered in order to optimise the impact of pneumococcal vaccination programmes in Canada.

Methods

During July–October 2024, the ACIP Pneumococcal Vaccines Work Group considered PCV use among PCV-naïve adults aged 50–64 years within the Evidence to Recommendations (EtR) framework. † Published and unpublished data on pneumococcal disease incidence and mortality, pneumococcal vaccination coverage, and economic models of age-based PCV use at age ≥ 50 years were reviewed; and findings were summarized by race and ethnicity whenever available. Previous Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) reviews for PCV15, PCV20, and PCV21 were supplemented by an updated search of MEDLINE, (using PubMed) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify additional literature on safety and immunogenicity. Postlicensure safety data on PCV20 from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and an analysis using Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) data were reviewed.

### Pneumococcal vaccination in general internal medicine practice: current practice and future possibilities [^111qtew3]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumococcal vaccine (PPV) is recommended for adults ≥ 65 years and those with chronic illness, but there are potential advantages of universal vaccination of adults age 50–64 years.

Objective

To assess reported (1) recommendations and administration practices of general internists for PPV, (2) barriers to vaccination, and (3) willingness to expand vaccination to all adults ≥ 50 years.

Methods

National survey of general internists representative of the American College of Physicians.

Results

Response rate was 74% (N = 326). Although 99% reported giving PPV, less than 20% used a computerized database to identify eligible patients by age or diagnoses and only 6% recalled patients. Major barriers included acute problems taking precedence over preventive care (39%), difficulty determining vaccination history (30%), not thinking of it/not a priority (20%), and inadequate reimbursement for vaccine (19%). If ACIP expanded recommendations, 60% would definitely and 37% would probably institute this change.

Conclusions

Most general internists reported giving PPV, but delivery was hindered by competing demands, lack of systems to identify patients needing vaccination, and reimbursement issues. Barriers might be decreased by a policy of universal vaccination of adults ≥ 50 years, and the majority of physicians reported they would follow such a recommendation if it were made.

### A phase 3 clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V116 in pneumococcal vaccine-experienced adults 50 years of age or older (STRIDE-6) [^113shJ2L]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumococcal diseases cause considerable morbidity and mortality in adults. V116 is an investigational 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) specifically designed to protect adults from pneumococcal serotypes responsible for the majority of residual pneumococcal diseases. This phase 3 study evaluated safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V116 in pneumococcal vaccine-experienced adults aged ≥ 50 years.

Methods

A total of 717 adults were enrolled to receive a single dose of pneumococcal vaccine as follows: cohort 1 (n = 350) previously received 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) and were randomized 2:1 to receive V116 or PCV15, respectively; cohort 2 (n = 261) previously received PCV13 and were randomized 2:1 to receive V116 or PPSV23, respectively; cohort 3 (n = 106) previously received PPSV23 + PCV13, PCV13 + PPSV23, PCV15 + PPSV23, or PCV15 and all received open-label V116. Immunogenicity was evaluated 30 days postvaccination using opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) geometric mean titers (GMTs) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) for all V116 serotypes. Safety was evaluated as the proportion of participants with adverse events (AEs).

Results

V116 was immunogenic across all 3 cohorts as assessed by serotype-specific OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs postvaccination for all 21 serotypes. V116 elicited comparable immune responses to serotypes shared with PCV15 (cohort 1) or PPSV23 (cohort 2), and higher immune responses to serotypes unique to V116. The proportions of participants with solicited AEs were generally comparable across cohorts.

Conclusions

V116 is well tolerated with a safety profile comparable to currently licensed pneumococcal vaccines and generates IgG and functional immune responses to all V116 serotypes, regardless of prior pneumococcal vaccine received.

Rationale and Evidence

Pneumococcal Disease Incidence in Adults Aged ≥ 19 Years

Pneumococcal pneumonia, accounting for 12%–13% of all hospitalized pneumonia cases, has been estimated to result in approximately 225,000 U.S. adult hospitalizations annually. Among adults aged 50–64 years with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and those hospitalized with pneumococcal pneumonia, approximately 90% had one or more risk condition. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 30,000 IPD § cases occurred annually among U.S. adults. In 2022, adults aged 50–64 years experienced IPD incidence and mortality rates of 13.2 and 1.8 per 100,000 population, respectively. These rates were higher than those in all other age groups except adults aged ≥ 65 years, whose incidence and mortality rates were 17.2 and 2.7 per 100,000 population, respectively. According to CDC's Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) data, during 2018–2022 (before PCV20 was widely used and before PCV21 approval among adults), 56% and 83% of IPD cases were due to pneumococcal serotypes contained in PCV20 and PCV21 in adults aged 50–64 years, respectively.

Racial Disparities in Pneumococcal Disease Incidence and Vaccination Coverage

An estimated 32%–54% of adults aged 50–64 years had at least one risk condition that qualifies for risk-based pneumococcal vaccination. ** However, 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data showed that only 37% of adults aged 50–64 years with a risk-based vaccination recommendation received a pneumococcal vaccine, compared with 70% of adults aged ≥ 65 years with an age-based recommendation; racial disparities in vaccination rates were apparent ††. ABCs data showed that IPD rates among Black adults peaked at a younger age (55–59 years) compared with rates among non-Black adults whose IPD rates increased with increasing age. Although PCV13 use among U.S. children has reduced disparities in PCV13-type IPD incidence in adults, likely because of indirect effects; remaining racial disparities are driven by non-PCV13 serotypes, with non-PCV13 serotype IPD rates among AI/AN and Black adults (25 and 10 per 100,000 population, respectively) exceeding the population average of six per 100,000.

Cost-effectiveness. Economic models assessed cost-effectiveness of the new policy options compared with existing recommendations. Three economic models assessed PCV20 alone for all adults aged ≥ 65 years; cost-effectiveness estimates ranged from cost-saving ***** to $39,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Two economic models assessed use of PCV15 in series with PPSV23 for all adults aged ≥ 65 years; estimates ranged from cost-saving to $282,000 per QALY gained. The CDC model found cost savings in all scenarios for use of either PCV20 alone or PCV15 in series with PPSV23 for all adults aged ≥ 65 years. Cost estimates of policy options for adults aged 19–64 years with certain underlying medical conditions ranged from $11,000 to $292,000 per QALY gained for PCV20 and from $250,000 to $656,000 for PCV15 in series with PPSV23.

Summary. Use of PCV20 alone or PCV15 in series with PPSV23 is expected to reduce pneumococcal disease incidence in adults aged ≥ 65 years and in those aged 19–64 years with certain underlying conditions. Findings from studies suggested that the immunogenicity and safety of PCV20 alone or PCV15 in series with PPSV23 were comparable to PCV13 alone or PCV13 in series with PPSV23. Cost-effectiveness studies demonstrated that use of PCV20 alone or PCV15 in series with PPSV23 for adults at age 65 years was cost-saving. The new policy simplifies adult pneumococcal vaccine recommendations (Table 1) and is expected to improve vaccine coverage among adults and prevent more pneumococcal disease. An amendment to recommend PCV20 for all adults aged ≥ 50 years instead of age ≥ 65 years was considered but rejected (Table 2). A summary of Work Group deliberations on use of either PCV20 alone or PCV15 in series with PPSV23 for all adults aged ≥ 65 years or adults aged 19–64 years with certain underlying conditions is available in the EtR tables.

Adults Who Have Completed Their Recommended Vaccine Series With Both PCV13 and PPSV23

Shared clinical decision-making is recommended regarding administration of PCV20 for any adult aged ≥ 65 years who has completed the recommended vaccine series with both PCV13 and PPSV23 (i.e. PPSV23 was administered at age ≥ 65 years) but has not received PCV15 or PCV20. If a decision to administer PCV20 is made, a single dose of PCV20 is recommended ≥ 5 years after the last pneumococcal vaccine dose. Considerations for shared clinical decision-making might include the patient's risk for pneumococcal disease due to underlying medical conditions, time since last pneumococcal vaccination, or risk for exposure to pneumococcal serotypes contained in PCV20 (Box).

BOX
Considerations for shared clinical decision-making regarding use of 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in adults aged ≥ 65 years who have completed their recommended vaccine series with 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine

20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20) is a safe and immunogenic vaccine for older adults. The risk for 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13)-type disease among adults aged ≥ 65 years is much lower than it was before the pediatric program was implemented as a result of indirect PCV13 effects (by preventing carriage and, thereby, reducing transmission of PCV13-type strains). The effects of PCV20 use in children on adult pneumococcal disease burden are unknown.
For these adults who have already received a dose of both PCV13 and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23), the remaining risk depends on each patient's risk for exposure to serotypes contained in PCV20, presence of underlying medical conditions or risk factors that increase the risk for developing pneumococcal disease or developing severe manifestation from disease, and time since last pneumococcal vaccination.
Incidence of PCV20-type invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumonia increases with increasing age and is higher among persons who have more than one chronic medical condition, * a cerebrospinal fluid leak, a cochlear implant, or an immunocompromising condition. † Although indirect effects from pediatric PCV13 use were documented for these groups of adults with underlying conditions that increase the risk for pneumococcal disease, the residual PCV13-type disease burden remains higher in these groups. § There might be added benefit from PCV20 vaccination for these persons at increased risk for pneumococcal disease, especially if time has elapsed (i.e. ≥ 5 years) since last receipt of pneumococcal vaccine.

Recommendations for Use of PCV

ACIP recommended PCV for all PCV-naïve adults aged ≥ 50 years. Recommendations for PCVs for adults aged 19–49 years with a risk condition and for adults who have previously received PCV13 remain unchanged (Table). The recommendation was supported by several factors, including the potential to improve vaccination coverage and reduce pneumococcal disease incidence and mortality in adults aged 50–64 years, particularly among demographic groups experiencing higher disease rates. Ease of implementing consistent age-based recommendations for all PCVs was also considered. Uncertainties regarding key assumptions guiding the economic models and higher cost per QALY estimates for PCV20 compared with PCV21 were acknowledged.

### Age-stratified burden of pneumococcal community acquired pneumonia in hospitalised Canadian adults from 2010 to 2015 [^111SDpE3]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

First, the economic impact of CAP is primarily driven by hospitalisations and deaths. Adults aged ≥ 65 years represented only 67% of deaths attributed to pCAP, 43% of the ICU admissions and 43% of patients requiring mechanical ventilation (table 1). Adults 50–64 years contributed significantly to the burden of pCAP disease with 30.8% of pCAP hospitalisations, 22.8% of pCAP deaths, 37.0% of pCAP cases requiring ICU admission and 36.6% of those requiring mechanical ventilation. Adults aged 16–49 years represented 10.0% of pCAP deaths, 20.2% of ICU admissions and 20.1% of pCAP cases requiring mechanical ventilation. Second, of the pCAP cases identified (figure 2 and online supplementary table S2) and pCAP cases attributed to PCV13 serotypes (figure 3 and online supplementary table S5), adults aged ≥ 65 years represent less than half (47.1% and 41.4%, respectively). Adults aged 50–64 years represented 30.8% of pCAP and 33.0% of PCV13 pCAP. Adults aged 16–49 years represented 22.0% and 25.6%, respectively. Finally, incidence rates for pCAP and pCAP attributed to PCV13 serotypes were highest in adults aged ≥ 65 years (figures 2 and 3, and online supplementary tables S3, S4 and S6). The incidence rates for adults aged 16–49 years were the lowest, at approximately 10-fold less than adults aged ≥ 65 years for any of the study years. With the low incidence rates in adults aged 16–49 years and their smaller contributions to the burden of illness, a recommendation of pneumococcal vaccines for all immune competent adults seems unjustified. However, the observed high incidence rates and burden of illness in adults aged 50–64 years suggests that expanding the age-based recommendation for pneumococcal vaccination to include adults aged 50–64 years would provide optimal protection. Over 90% adults 50–64 years had at least one comorbidity (table 1) placing them at risk for pneumococcal diseaseand would therefore be recommended to receive PPV23 under current immunisation programmes, yet only 45% of adults hospitalised with CAP in this age group had been vaccinated. Similarly, 27% of hospitalised adults aged 50–64 years were immunocompromised and therefore would be recommended to receive both PCV13 and PPV23 in current Canadian guidelines. Despite this, only 3.5% of adults had received PCV13 (table 1). Shifting from risk-based to age-based immunisation recommendations in adults aged 50–64 years may facilitate improved uptake in both healthy adults and adults with comorbidities, putting them at higher risk for pnuemococcal disease. In Spain, adults aged 60–64 years with medical comorbidities were almost twice as likely to receive influenza vaccine in a region in which the age-based recommendation for influenza vaccination was expanded to include adults aged 60 years and older, compared with other regions of the country in which age-based recommendations began at age 65 years and younger adults were recommended to receive vaccine based on risk due to presence of comorbidities. Similarly, introduction of a universal influenza immunisation programme in the Canadian province of Ontario in 2000 resulted in a more than doubling of the immunisation coverage rate (from 18% in the period of targeted vaccine recommendations to 42% following implementation of a universal programme for all Ontarians older than 6 months). Notably, the largest increases in coverage were observed in adults aged 50–64 years and in people with underlying comorbidities. Overall, expansion of pneumococcal immunisation recommendations in Canada to include adults aged ≥ 50 years would capture 78.0% of pCAP cases, 74.4% of pCAP attributed to PCV13 serotypes, 90% of pCAP deaths, 79.8% of pCAP ICU admissions, 79.9% of pCAP cases requiring mechanical ventilation, and may be associated with improved vaccine coverage rates among high-risk adults.

### Public health and aging: influenza vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥ 50 years and pneumococcal vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥ 65 years – United States, 2002 [^115n37TP]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2003). Low credibility.

Vaccination of persons at risk for complications from influenza and pneumococcal disease is a key public health strategy in preventing morbidity and mortality in the United States. During the 1990–1999 influenza seasons, approximately 36,000 deaths were attributed annually to influenza infection, with approximately 90% of deaths occurring among adults aged ≥ 65 years. In 1998, an estimated 3,400 adults aged ≥ 65 years died as a result of invasive pneumococcal disease. One of the national health objectives for 2010 is to achieve 90% coverage of noninstitutionalized adults aged ≥ 65 years for both influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations (objective no. 14.29). In 2000, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) broadened the universal recommendations for influenza vaccination to include adults aged 50–64 years in addition to adults aged ≥ 65 years. To assess progress toward achieving the 2010 national health objective and implementing the ACIP recommendations, CDC analyzed data from the 2002 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicate that influenza and pneumococcal vaccination levels among adults aged ≥ 65 years and influenza vaccination levels among adults aged 50–64 years varied widely among states/areas and racial/ethnic populations. Innovative approaches are needed to increase vaccination coverage, particularly among certain populations.

### Cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination among patients with CKD in the United States [^116gsL8r]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for adults 65 years and older and those younger than 65 years with clinical indications (eg, diabetes, lung/heart disease, kidney failure, and nephrotic syndrome). Its cost-effectiveness in less severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) is uncharacterized.

Study Design

Cost-effectiveness analysis.

Setting & Population

US adults aged 50 to 64 and 65 to 79 years stratified by CKD risk status: no CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 60mL/min/1.73m 2 and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio < 30mg/g), CKD with moderate risk, CKD with high risk, and kidney failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 15mL/min/1.73m 2) or nephrotic-range albuminuria (urinary albumin-creatinine ratio ≥ 2,000mg/g). Data sources were the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999 to 2004, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study.

Intervention(S)

Vaccination compared to no vaccination.

Outcomes

Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios based on US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).

Model, Perspective, & Timeframe

Markov model, US health sector perspective, and lifetime horizon.

Results

The prevalence of pneumococcal vaccination in NHANES 1999 to 2004 was 56.6% (aged 65–79 years), 28.5% (aged 50–64 years with an indication), and 9.7% (aged 50–64 years without an indication), with similar prevalences across CKD risk status. Pneumococcal vaccination was overall cost-effective (< US $100,000/QALY) for adults aged 65 to 79 years (US $15,000/QALY) and 50 to 64 years (US $38,000/QALY). Among those aged 50 to 64 years, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were lowest for kidney failure or nephrotic-range albuminuria (US $1,000/QALY), followed by CKD with high risk (US $17,000/QALY), CKD with moderate risk (US $25,000/QALY), and no CKD (US $43,000/QALY). Pneumococcal vaccination was cost-effective among adults aged 50 to 64 years with CKD even when assuming the lowest vaccine efficacy or 50% higher vaccine costs.

Limitations

Some model parameters were based on data from the general population. Analysis did not consider costs associated with kidney disease progression.

Conclusions

Uptake of pneumococcal vaccination should be improved in general. Our results also suggest the cost-effectiveness of expanding its indication to younger adults with CKD less severe than kidney failure or nephrotic syndrome.

### Cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination policies and uptake programs in US older populations [^115sJ8ba]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Recently revised vaccination recommendations for US adults, aged 65years and older, include both 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), with PCV13 now recommended for immunocompetent older people based on shared decision making. The public health impact and cost-effectiveness of this recommendation or of pneumococcal vaccine uptake improvement interventions are unclear.

Design

Markov decision analysis.

Setting and Participants

Hypothetical 65-year-old general and black population cohorts.

Intervention

Current pneumococcal vaccination recommendations for US older people, an alternative policy omitting PCV13 in immunocompetent older people, and vaccine uptake improvement programs.

Results

The current pneumococcal vaccination recommendation was the most effective strategy, but afforded slight public health benefits compared to an alternative (PPSV23 for all older people plus PCV13 for the immunocompromised) and cost greater than $750 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained in either population group with a vaccine uptake improvement program (absolute uptake increase = 12.3%; cost = $1.78/eligible patient) in place. The alternative strategy was more economically favorable, but cost greater than $100 000/QALY in either population, with or without an uptake intervention. Results were robust in sensitivity analyses; however, in black older people, the alternative strategy with an uptake program was most likely to be favored in probabilistic sensitivity analyses at a $150 000/QALY gained threshold.

Conclusion

Current pneumococcal vaccination recommendations for US older people are economically unfavorable compared to an alternative strategy omitting PCV13 in the immunocompetent. The alternative recommendation with an uptake improvement program may be economically reasonable in black population analyses and could be worth considering as a population-wide recommendation if mitigating racial disparities is a priority.

### Safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, V116, in healthy adults: phase 1 / 2, randomised, double-blind, active comparator-controlled, multicentre, US-based trial [^111yYTWs]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Background

A pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) specifically focused on serotypes associated with adult residual disease burden is urgently needed. We aimed to assess V116, an investigational 21-valent PCV, that contains pneumococcal polysaccharides (PnPs), which account for 74–94% of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults aged 65 years or older.

Methods

We did a phase 1/2, randomised, double-blind, active comparator-controlled, multicentre, non-inferiority and superiority trial. The phase 1 study was done at two clinical sites in the USA, and the phase 2 study was done in 18 clinical sites in the USA. Eligible participants were healthy adults with or without chronic medical conditions assessed as stable, aged 18–49 years in the phase 1 trial and aged 50 years or older in the phase 2 trial. Participants were excluded if they had a history of invasive pneumococcal disease or other culture-positive pneumococcal disease within the past 3 years, known hypersensitivity to a vaccine component, known or suspected impairment of immunological function, were pregnant or were breastfeeding, or had previously received any pneumococcal vaccine. Participants had to abstain from sexual activity or use protocol approved contraception. All participants were centrally randomly assigned to a vaccine group using an interactive response technology system. Participants and investigators were masked to group assignment. In phase 1, participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive a single dose of V116–1 (2 μg per pneumococcal polysaccharide [PnP] per 0·5 mL) or V116–2 (4 μg per PnP per 1·0 mL) or the 23-valent unconjugated PnP vaccine, PPSV23 (25 μg per PnP per 0·5 mL). In phase 2, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive one dose of V116 (4 μg per PnP per 1·0 mL) or PPSV23 (25 μg per PnP per 0·5 mL), stratified by age. Safety analyses included all randomly assigned participants who received study vaccine; immunogenicity analyses were per protocol. For both phases, the primary safety outcome was the proportion of participants with solicited injection-site adverse events and solicited systemic adverse events up to day 5 after vaccination and the proportion of participants with vaccine-related serious adverse events to 6 months after vaccination. In phase 2, primary immunogenicity outcomes were to test non-inferiority of V116 compared with PPSV23 as measured by serotype-specific opsonophagocytic antibody geometric mean titres (OPA-GMT) ratios for the serotypes common to the two vaccines at 30 days after vaccination (using a 0·33 margin) and to test superiority of V116 compared with PPSV23 as measured by serotype-specific OPA-GMT ratios for the serotypes unique to V116 at 30 days after vaccination (using a 1·0 margin). This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04168190.

Findings

Between Dec 6 and 26, 2019, 92 volunteers were screened and 90 (98%) enrolled for phase 1 (59 [66%] women; 31 [34%] men); 30 participants were assigned to each group and received study vaccine. 30 (100%) participants in the V116–1 group, 29 (97%) in the V116–2 group, and 30 (100%) participants in the PPSV23 group were included in the per-protocol immunogenicity evaluation. From Sept 23, 2020, to Jan 12, 2021, 527 volunteers were screened, and 510 (97%) participants were enrolled in the phase 2 trial. 508 participants (> 99%; 254 [100%] of 254 participants randomly assigned to the V116 group and 254 [99%] of 256 randomly assigned to PPSV23 group) received study vaccine (281 [55%] women; 227 [45%] men). 252 (99%) of 254 of participants in the V116 group and 254 (99%) of 256 participants in the PPSV23 group were included in the primary immunogenicity analyses. There were no vaccine-related serious adverse events or vaccine-related deaths in either study phase. In both phases, the most common solicited injection site adverse event was injection site pain (phase 1 22 [73%] participants in V116–1 group, 23 [77%] participants in V116–2 group, and 17 [57%] participants in the PPSV23 group; phase 2 118 [46%] of 254 participants in the V116 group and 96 [38%] of 254 in the PPSV23 group]. The most common solicited systemic adverse events in phase 1 was fatigue (eight [27%] participants in the V116–1 group, eight [27%] participants in the V116–2 group, and five [17%] participants in PPSV23 group) and myalgia (eight [27%] participants in the V116–1 group, nine (30%) participants in the V116–2 group, and four (13%) participants in the PPSV23 group]. In phase 2, the most frequently reported solicited systemic adverse event was fatigue (49 [19%] participants in V116 group, and 31 [12%] participants in PPSV23 group). In both phases, most of the solicited adverse events in all vaccine groups were mild and of short duration (≤ 3 days). V116 met non-inferiority criteria compared with PPSV23 for the 12 shared serotypes and met superiority criteria compared to PPSV23 for the nine unique serotypes.

Interpretation

V116 was well tolerated with a safety profile generally similar to PPSV23; consistent with licensed pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Functional OPA antibodies were induced to all V116 vaccine serotypes. The vaccine was non-inferior to PPSV23 for the 12 serotypes common to both vaccines and superior to PPSV23 for the nine unique serotypes in V116. Our findings support the development of V116 for prevention of pneumococcal disease in adults.

### Expanded recommendations for use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines among adults aged ≥ 50 years: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2024 [^111fyNFo]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Medium credibility.

Before October 2024, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended use of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) for all adults aged ≥ 65 years, as well as for those aged 19–64 years with risk conditions for pneumococcal disease who have not received a PCV or whose vaccination history is unknown. Options included either 20-valent PCV (PCV20; Prevnar20; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals) or 21-valent PCV (PCV21; CAPVAXIVE; Merck Sharp & Dohme) alone or 15-valent PCV (PCV15; VAXNEUVANCE; Merck Sharp & Dohme) in series with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23; Pneumovax23; Merck Sharp & Dohme). There are additional recommendations for use of PCV20 or PCV21 for adults who started their pneumococcal vaccination series with 13-valent PCV (PCV13; Prevnar13; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals). The ACIP Pneumococcal Vaccines Work Group employed the Evidence to Recommendations framework to guide its deliberations on expanding the age-based PCV recommendation to include adults aged 50–64 years. On October 23, 2024, ACIP recommended a single dose of PCV for all PCV-naïve adults aged ≥ 50 years. Recommendations for PCVs among adults aged 19–49 years with risk conditions and PCV13-vaccinated adults have not changed from previous recommendations. This report summarizes evidence considered for these recommendations and provides updated clinical guidance for use of PCV.

### Preventability of invasive pneumococcal disease and assessment of current polysaccharide vaccine recommendations for adults: United States, 2001–2003 [^117CY3WJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

BACKGROUND. To prevent Streptococcus pneumoniae infection among persons at highest risk for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) is currently recommended for persons ≥ 65 years old and persons 2–64 years old with certain underlying conditions. Policymakers have considered expanding recommendations for PPV to include persons who are 50–64 years old and additional populations at risk for IPD. Our objectives were to determine the proportion of IPD cases that might have been prevented if all persons with vaccine indications had been vaccinated and to evaluate new indications.

Methods

From 2001 to 2003, we performed a case series study of IPD in adults at 6 sites of the Active Bacterial Core surveillance-Emerging Infections Program Network. A case of IPD was defined as isolation of pneumococcus from a normally sterile site from a resident of 1 of the surveillance areas.

Results

Among 1878 case patients, 1558 (83%) had at least 1 current vaccine indication; of these, 968 case patients (62%) were unvaccinated. Adherence to existing vaccine recommendations would have prevented 21% of all cases. The proportions of all cases potentially prevented by each new indication were as follows: lowering the universal age of recommended vaccination to 50 years, 5.0%-7.0%; adding new risk-based indications to include current smoking, 1.5%-2.5%; former smoking, 0.4%-0.7%; black race, 1.0%-1.4%; and asthma, 0.3%-0.4%.

Conclusions

Increasing vaccine coverage rates among persons with a current indication may prevent more cases than expanding existing indications. Of the potential new indications studied, the strategy that may prevent most cases is lowering the recommended age for universal vaccination to 50 years.

### Assessment of vaccine candidates for persons aged 50 and older: a review [^115cMQmq]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The increasing life expectancy in most European countries has resulted in the growth of the population 50 and older. Although this population will continue to increase, it may not age healthily. It is estimated that by 2060, persons aged 65 and older will account for 30.0% of the total population of the EU-27 (the 27 Member States of the European Union), compared to 17.0% in 2008.

As a result of immunosenescence (the gradual deterioration of the immune system), co-morbidity and general frailty, this population is more susceptible than younger persons to infectious diseases, resulting in higher mortality and morbidity rates in older persons than in young adults. Infections may lead to irreversible frailty and, thereby, more dependency on long-term healthcare. Vaccinating persons aged 50 and older against vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) may be one strategy to promote healthy aging.

Apart from possible benefits to individuals in this age group, vaccination may yield social benefits, such as lower overall costs of European healthcare. Most European countries offer influenza vaccine to this population, and some countries also offer pneumococcal vaccine. However, vaccination against other VPDs is not common, despite initiatives to update the programmes.

The aim of this review is to evaluate the vaccines available for persons aged 50 and older and to explore the arguments of programmatic vaccination for herpes zoster, pneumococcal disease, pertussis and hepatitis A. For each of these infectious diseases, we review the current knowledge of these vaccines as specifically applied to this population and describe each of four domains (pathogen, vaccine, disease and cost effectiveness), according to the model of Kimman et al.

Rationale for vaccine choice

Herpes zoster, pneumococcal disease, pertussis and hepatitis A were chosen for this review because a vaccine for each is registered in Europe. Furthermore, a report by the Dutch health council on the future of the national immunization programme focused on the possibility of persons aged 50 and older as a target group for vaccination against herpes zoster, pneumococcal disease and pertussis. Their report considered vaccination for hepatitis A to be universal.

Beyond the Netherlands and Europe, the consensus in the United States is that these four vaccines are important throughout life. Vaccination for herpes zoster is recommended from the age of 60 and for pneumococcal disease from 65 by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Furthermore, a combined vaccine for tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis is recommended every 10 years. For hepatitis A, two doses in a lifetime are recommended when any risk factor is present.

Regarding preventative measures for pneumococcal vaccination in adults, more specifically with respect to schedules, CDC 2019 guidelines recommend to take into account the individual patient's risk for exposure to PCV13 serotypes and the risk for pneumococcal disease for that person as a result of underlying medical conditions when patients and vaccine providers engage in shared clinical decision-making for PCV13 use to determine whether PCV13 is right for the specific individual aged ≥ 65 years.

### Licensure of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for adults aged 50 years and older [^113LsvvJ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2012). Low credibility.

In 2010, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13 [Prevnar 13, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a subsidiary of Pfizer, Inc.]) was licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for children aged 6 weeks through 71 months for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by the 13 pneumococcal serotypes included in the vaccine. PCV13 currently is recommended as a 4-dose series for children starting at age 2 months. On December 30, 2011, FDA approved PCV13 for prevention of pneumonia and invasive disease caused by PCV13 serotypes among adults aged 50 years and older. This report summarizes data on the immunogenicity and safety of PCV13 in adults and outlines key additional evidence requested by ACIP to formulate recommendations for its use.

Regarding preventative measures for pneumococcal vaccination in adults, more specifically with respect to timing and intervals, CDC 2019 guidelines recommend to offer 1 additional dose of PPSV23 at age ≥ 65 years in adults who received ≥ 1 dose of PPSV23 before age 65 years, at least 5 years after the previous PPSV23 dose.

### Pneumococcal vaccine for adults aged ≥ 19 years: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices, United States, 2023 [^111JTn5Z]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

VSD is a collaborative project among CDC, participating sites, and networks across the United States and uses electronic health data from participating sites to monitor and assess the safety of vaccines. VSD contains population-safety studies and can be used to assess hypotheses that arise from reviews of medical literature, reports to VAERS, changes in vaccination schedules, or introduction of new vaccines. For all pneumococcal vaccines, additional review of VAERS was conducted to assess safety data that were reported through August 31, 2022.

The ACIP Pneumococcal Vaccines Work Group met by teleconference regularly (usually once to twice per month). Experts external to the work group were invited to present current research and discuss published and unpublished data. The work group summarized and presented the evidence to ACIP to help formulate recommendations. ACIP votes were held when a new pneumococcal vaccine recommendation was under consideration (e.g. new age indications or dosing regimens for a vaccine), or when additional groups were identified as being at risk for pneumococcal disease. New ACIP recommendations in this report were discussed during the ACIP meeting on October 19, 2022. At that time ACIP members voted to approve a draft of the following adult pneumococcal vaccine recommendations: use of either a single dose of PCV20 or PPSV23 as previously recommended for adults with an immunocompromising condition, a CSF leak, or a cochlear implant who have started their pneumococcal vaccine series with PCV13 but have not received all recommended PPSV23 doses; shared clinical decision-making regarding PCV20 use for adults aged ≥ 65 years who have completed their recommended vaccine series with both PCV13 and PPSV23; and use of either a single dose of PCV20 or PPSV23 as previously recommended for adults who have received PCV13 only. These recommendations were based on pre–COVID-19 pandemic pneumococcal disease burden data because the incidence of pneumococcal disease has been dynamic since the pandemic onset (i.e. a reduction of invasive pneumococcal disease early in the pandemic, with reports of increases after countries relaxed their nonpharmaceutical interventions). In addition, work group and ACIP members reviewed and commented on a draft of updated and new CDC guidance for implementation for adults who have received PPSV23 only, adults who have received PCV7 only, and adults who are HSCT recipients. The guidelines for implementation were presented during the October 19 meeting with supporting data but were not subjected to a vote because the intent was only to provide guidance on how to apply the new ACIP recommendations for specific populations.

### Pneumococcal vaccination in adults: does it really work? [^116JopoW]. Respiratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The universal burden of pneumococcal disease is high. As pneumococcal capsular antigens induce serotype specific antibodies, both the available vaccines (polysaccharide and polysaccharide conjugated) are able to produce serological response. However, there is reasonable skepticism about the effectiveness and efficacy of the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine, especially in the elderly and in immunocompromised adults. Results from numerous studies are conflicting but the more recent data suggest that polysaccharide vaccine raises inadequate protection against non-bacteremic pneumonia, while the benefit against invasive pneumococcal disease in high-risk population is uncertain. On the contrary, conjugate vaccine, -originally indicated only for infants and young children- appears to be highly effective but it does not cover the tremendous diversity of pneumococcal serotypes being able to cause disease in adults. Despite this, there is growing evidence that conjugate vaccines, due to their superior immunogenicity, could also be offered for adult vaccination, but still there are certain issues that warrant further investigation.

Clinical Efficacy and Effectiveness in Adults With Immunocompromising Conditions

One RCT among Ugandan adults living with HIV infection conducted during 1995–1998 observed no protection against IPD due to all serotypes (VE = −48%; 95% CI = −232% to 35%) or VT-IPD (VE = −114%; 95% CI = −431% to 14%). Of note, this study was conducted before highly active antiretroviral therapy was widely available, > 10% of the vaccinated and placebo groups were lost to follow-up, and 28% of remaining participants in each group had died by the end of the study period. Observational studies have demonstrated mixed results regarding PPSV23 VE against IPD among adults with HIV infection. Three indirect cohort studies reported VT-IPD effectiveness by risk groups in the same study. Typically, adults with immunocompromising conditions had lower VE than adults without underlying medical conditions, and VE in older adults (aged ≥ 65 years) often was not significant when ≥ 2 years had passed since PPSV23 vaccination.

Duration of Protection

Data on duration of protection after PPSV23 vaccination are only available through observational studies. In a large, indirect cohort study from England and Wales, VE of PPSV23 against VT-IPD declined significantly with time since vaccination from 48% (95% CI = 32%–60%) among those vaccinated ≤ 2 years ago to 15% (95% CI = −3% to 30%) among those vaccinated ≥ 5 years ago (p < 0.001). In another study from England and Wales, VE of PPSV23 against VT-IPD declined from 41% (95% CI = 23%–54%) among those vaccinated ≤ 2 years ago to 34% (95% CI = 16%–48%) among those vaccinated 2–4 years ago and to 23% (95% CI = 12%–32%) among those vaccinated ≥ 5 years ago. Although this difference in VE by time since vaccination was not statistically significant (p = 0.13), a spline model indicated a decline in VE from approximately 50% to a plateau of 20%–25% after 5 years. Both studies found a declining trend in VE against VT-IPD regardless of age at vaccination. In the three studies on the duration of protection of PPSV23 against CAP, diagnostic criteria for determining pneumococcal CAP varied. Nevertheless, a declining trend in VE against CAP was observed with increasing time since vaccination in all identified studies.

### Cost-effectiveness of adult vaccination strategies using pneumococcal conjugate vaccine compared with pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine [^1132kcgb]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Context

The cost-effectiveness of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) compared with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) among US adults is unclear.

Objective

To estimate the cost-effectiveness of PCV13 vaccination strategies in adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A Markov state-transition model, lifetime time horizon, societal perspective. Simulations were performed in hypothetical cohorts of US 50-year-olds. Vaccination strategies and effectiveness estimates were developed by a Delphi expert panel; indirect (herd immunity) effects resulting from childhood PCV13 vaccination were extrapolated based on observed PCV7 effects. Data sources for model parameters included Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Active Bacterial Core surveillance, National Hospital Discharge Survey and Nationwide Inpatient Sample data, and the National Health Interview Survey.

Main Outcome Measures

Pneumococcal disease cases prevented and incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.

Results

In the base case scenario, administration of PCV13 as a substitute for PPSV23 in current recommendations (ie, vaccination at age 65 years and at younger ages if comorbidities are present) cost $28,900 per QALY gained compared with no vaccination and was more cost-effective than the currently recommended PPSV23 strategy. Routine PCV13 at ages 50 and 65 years cost $45,100 per QALY compared with PCV13 substituted in current recommendations. Adding PPSV23 at age 75 years to PCV13 at ages 50 and 65 years gained 0.00002 QALYs, costing $496,000 per QALY gained. Results were robust in sensitivity analyses and alternative scenarios, except when low PCV13 effectiveness against nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia was assumed or when greater childhood vaccination indirect effects were modeled. In these cases, PPSV23 as currently recommended was favored.

Conclusion

Overall, PCV13 vaccination was favored compared with PPSV23, but the analysis was sensitive to assumptions about PCV13 effectiveness against nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and the magnitude of potential indirect effects from childhood PCV13 on pneumococcal serotype distribution.

Future Research and Monitoring Priorities

CDC will continue to assess the safety, implementation and the impact of shared clinical decision-making regarding administration of PCV13 to adults aged ≥ 65 years; the indirect effect of pediatric PCV13 vaccination on disease burden among older adults; and the emergence of nonvaccine serotypes, to inform policy decisions for higher valency conjugate vaccines currently in development. ACIP will continue to review relevant data as they become available and update pneumococcal vaccination policy as appropriate.

Before administering PCV13 or PPSV23, health care providers should consult the relevant package inserts regarding precautions, warnings, and contraindications. Adverse events occurring after administration of any vaccine should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Reports can be submitted to VAERS online, by facsimile, or by mail. More information about VAERS is available at.

Abstract

Before October 2024, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended use of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) for all adults aged ≥ 65 years, as well as for those aged 19–64 years with risk conditions for pneumococcal disease who have not received a PCV or whose vaccination history is unknown. Options included either 20-valent PCV (PCV20; Prevnar20; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals) or 21-valent PCV (PCV21; CAPVAXIVE; Merck Sharp & Dohme) alone or 15-valent PCV (PCV15; VAXNEUVANCE; Merck Sharp & Dohme) in series with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23; Pneumovax23; Merck Sharp & Dohme). There are additional recommendations for use of PCV20 or PCV21 for adults who started their pneumococcal vaccination series with 13-valent PCV (PCV13; Prevnar13; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals). The ACIP Pneumococcal Vaccines Work Group employed the Evidence to Recommendations framework to guide its deliberations on expanding the age-based PCV recommendation to include adults aged 50–64 years. On October 23, 2024, ACIP recommended a single dose of PCV for all PCV-naïve adults aged ≥ 50 years. Recommendations for PCVs among adults aged 19–49 years with risk conditions and PCV13-vaccinated adults have not changed from previous recommendations. This report summarizes evidence considered for these recommendations and provides updated clinical guidance for use of PCV.

Regarding preventative measures for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pneumococcal vaccination, CDC 2019 guidelines recommend to recognize that PPSV23 contains 12 serotypes in common with PCV13 and an additional 11 serotypes for which there are no indirect effects from PCV13 use in children. Recognize that the additional 11 serotypes account for 32–37% of invasive pneumococcal diseases among adults aged ≥ 65 years.

Intervals Between PCV and PPSV23

Seven immunogenicity studies evaluating the immune response after a sequence of PCV13 or PCV15 followed by PPSV23 administered at intervals of 2, 6, or 12 months or 3–4 years were reviewed. Four were among adults aged ≥ 50 years without immunocompromising conditions. Three included younger adults (aged ≥ 18 years) who are considered to be at increased risk for pneumococcal disease: one among American Indian and non-American Indian adults with chronic medical conditions, one among adults with HIV infection, and one among adults with rheumatoid arthritis receiving biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. In addition to these seven studies, one PCV7 study that compared different intervals between PCV7 and PPSV23 among Alaska Native adults aged 55–70 years was included. Of eight studies, three that compared intervals ranging from 2 to 6 months between administration of PCV and PPSV23 in the same study found no significant difference in immunogenicity measured after PPSV23 receipt, although reactogenicity tended to be higher with shorter intervals. In a study conducted among pneumococcal vaccine–naïve adults aged 60–64 years that compared antibody responses to 1 dose of PCV13 with responses to PCV13 followed by PPSV23 1 year apart, the immune responses after PPSV23 were significantly lower compared with the responses after 1 dose of PCV13 for eight of 12 common serotypes. In another study among pneumococcal vaccine–naïve adults aged ≥ 50 years who received either PCV13 or PCV15 followed by PPSV23 1 year apart, immune responses (measured as GMFR in IgG concentrations and a greater than fourfold rise in OPA titers 1 month after vaccination compared with prevaccination) to PPSV23 were typically comparable to those measured 1 month after 1 dose of PCV for the serotypes contained in the PCVs. In another study that was conducted as an extension of a previous study in pneumococcal vaccine–naïve adults aged 50–64 years, antibody response to 1 dose of PCV13 was compared with responses to PCV13 followed by PPSV23 approximately 3.5 years apart. Immune responses after PPSV23 were significantly higher for seven of 12 common serotypes. These findings suggested that longer intervals between administration of PCV and PPSV23 might improve immunogenicity in immunocompetent adults, although a direct comparison between a 1- versus 4-year interval was not made.

Epidemiology of Pneumococcal Disease in U.S. Adults

In adults, the risk for pneumococcal disease increases with increasing age. Pneumococcal pneumonia is the most common form of pneumococcal disease in adults and is estimated to account for approximately 10% of hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases. According to commercial claims and encounter data, in 2014, an estimated 680 (adults aged 18–49 years) to 9,570 (adults aged ≥ 85 years) all-cause pneumonia cases per 100,000 person-years resulted in health care use; during 2008–2014 the proportion of all-cause pneumonia cases that resulted in hospitalization was higher in older age groups, ranging from 8.5% among adults aged 18–49 years to 38.6% among adults aged ≥ 85 years. When limited to studies that collected data during 2010–2016, a systematic review of the literature on all-cause CAP hospitalization in the United States indicated that the estimated incidence ranges were 126–422 per 100,000 adults aged < 65 years and 847–3,365 per 100,000 adults aged ≥ 65 years. In a multistate surveillance study of hospitalized nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia (NBPP) patients, the estimated incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia was 12 per 100,000 adults aged 18–49 years and 105 per 100,000 adults aged ≥ 65 years in 2017. An assessment of adults hospitalized with clinical and radiographic evidence of pneumonia in Nashville, Tennessee, and Atlanta, Georgia, reported that the incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia hospitalizations ranged from 43 to 53 per 100,000 population.
