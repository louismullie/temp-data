## Question

Signs and symptoms of cardiac amyloidosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the signs and symptoms of cardiac amyloidosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology that drives the clinical phenotype. Then, I should categorize the manifestations by organ system, distinguishing cardiac from extracardiac features. Next, I will differentiate AL from ATTR phenotypes and highlight red flags that should trigger suspicion. After that, I should integrate the natural history and why early recognition matters. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized list of signs and symptoms and note key diagnostic implications, making sure I verify each claim against guidelines and high-quality reviews as I go.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic basis, because the clinical picture flows from it. Cardiac amyloidosis reflects extracellular deposition of misfolded proteins, predominantly immunoglobulin light chains in AL or transthyretin in ATTR, which thicken and stiffen the myocardium, producing a restrictive cardiomyopathy with diastolic dysfunction, conduction system infiltration, and autonomic neuropathy, all of which shape symptoms and signs [^f4e53a11] [^fa5aba57] [^8a562f6f].

> I will now examine the core cardiac manifestations, but wait, let me verify the hierarchy of frequency and severity. Heart failure symptoms predominate, typically exertional dyspnea and orthopnea, reflecting restrictive physiology with preserved ejection fraction early and progression to reduced EF later; fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance are common due to low-output physiology and autonomic dysfunction, and edema, hepatomegaly, and ascites reflect right-sided failure from restrictive filling and elevated venous pressures [^e71edd12] [^f4e53a11] [^b34b97dd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about arrhythmias and conduction disease; I should double-check their prevalence and clinical impact. Atrial fibrillation is frequent and often persistent, while conduction abnormalities include PR prolongation, bundle branch block, and high-grade AV block sometimes requiring pacing; ventricular arrhythmias occur and contribute to sudden death risk, so I need to ensure I flag these as both symptoms and prognostic markers [^415fea87] [^e71edd12] [^f4e53a11].

> Next, I should review extracardiac features that commonly accompany cardiac disease and can provide diagnostic clues. Peripheral neuropathy with sensory loss and autonomic dysfunction, including orthostatic hypotension and gastrointestinal dysmotility, is common, particularly in ATTRv; bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, spinal stenosis, and spontaneous biceps tendon rupture are musculoskeletal red flags for ATTR; macroglossia, periorbital purpura, and acquired factor X deficiency are more suggestive of AL and should heighten suspicion when present [^3e843bf6] [^f1a0f004] [^948ec4b5].

> Let me consider gastrointestinal involvement carefully, because it is often underrecognized. Symptoms such as early satiety, nausea, diarrhea or constipation, weight loss, and malabsorption reflect autonomic neuropathy and direct amyloid infiltration; prevalence is higher in AL and in ATTR with neuropathic variants, whereas ATTRwt tends to have fewer GI manifestations, so I should align the symptom pattern with the suspected subtype [^34028b30] [^f1a0f004].

> I should confirm renal and hematologic features that intersect with cardiac disease. Proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome are common in AL due to glomerular deposition and can coexist with cardiac failure; acquired factor X deficiency in AL contributes to bleeding and bruising, including periorbital purpura, which is a pathognomonic clue when seen with cardiac symptoms [^948ec4b5] [^f1a0f004].

> Now, I need to differentiate AL from ATTR phenotypes, because this shapes both the clinical picture and urgency. AL tends to present at a younger age, progresses rapidly, and carries a grim prognosis once heart failure develops, with median survival often measured in months without disease-directed therapy; ATTRwt typically presents in older adults with a more indolent course but still confers substantial mortality, and ATTRv may include neuropathy and earlier onset depending on the variant; recognizing these trajectories helps calibrate suspicion and timing of therapy [^a161694e] [^0e55437c] [^1167de1a].

> But wait, what if the patient is asymptomatic or has subtle findings; I should review early or preclinical disease. Asymptomatic ATTR cardiac infiltration is increasingly detected and carries a graded risk: higher-grade myocardial uptake on bone scintigraphy correlates with faster progression to heart failure and higher cardiovascular mortality, supporting the concept that early recognition before overt symptoms can change outcomes if disease-modifying therapy is initiated [^9e3dbac6].

> Next, I should review why early recognition matters clinically, and I need to ensure I cite the strongest data. Delays of 1–3 years are common, and in AL with cardiac involvement, median survival drops to roughly 4–12 months once heart failure emerges; conversely, early diagnosis enables plasma cell–directed therapy in AL and TTR stabilizers or silencers in ATTR, which improve survival and reduce hospitalizations, underscoring the cost of missed early windows [^5286343f] [^0c5909df] [^0e55437c].

> Let me synthesize a practical, prioritized list of signs and symptoms, and I should double-check that I am not overgeneralizing. Core cardiac features include exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance, peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, and ascites; arrhythmic and conduction features include palpitations, syncope or presyncope, and pacemaker dependence; extracardiac clues include bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, peripheral or autonomic neuropathy, spinal stenosis, biceps tendon rupture, macroglossia, periorbital purpura, proteinuria, and GI dysmotility; these clusters should trigger targeted testing for AL versus ATTR [^e71edd12] [^3e843bf6] [^f1a0f004].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic implications so clinicians know what to do next. Discordance between low QRS voltage on ECG and increased LV wall thickness on echo is a classic red flag, though absence of low voltage does not exclude disease; echocardiography with strain imaging and cardiac MRI with late gadolinium enhancement and T1/ECV mapping provide structural and tissue-level evidence of infiltration; bone scintigraphy with bone-avid tracers plus exclusion of a monoclonal protein is the noninvasive pathway to diagnose ATTR; and monoclonal gammopathy testing with serum free light chains and immunofixation identifies AL, enabling timely hematologic therapy [^dc0e2eee] [^e687d7b2] [^e04ce371] [^2f990423].

> In summary, cardiac amyloidosis presents with a constellation of heart failure and arrhythmic symptoms driven by restrictive physiology and conduction system infiltration, overlaid with extracardiac clues that differ by AL versus ATTR; recognizing these patterns early, especially in older adults with HFpEF, unexplained LV hypertrophy, or neuropathic symptoms, can avert catastrophic delays and unlock disease-modifying therapies that meaningfully alter prognosis [^f4e53a11] [^0e55437c] [^5286343f].

Cardiac amyloidosis presents with **heart failure symptoms** (dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, fatigue, and edema) [^e71edd12] due to restrictive cardiomyopathy and diastolic dysfunction [^b34b97dd]. Patients often have **low blood pressure**, **orthostatic hypotension**, and **intolerance to ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers** [^3e843bf6]. Arrhythmias are common, including atrial fibrillation, conduction block, and ventricular arrhythmias [^415fea87]. Extracardiac features may include bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, macroglossia, and periorbital purpura [^f1a0f004]. Early recognition is critical because symptoms are nonspecific and delays in diagnosis are common [^0c5909df].

### Misconceptions and facts about cardiac amyloidosis [^30986be2]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis is an important clinical entity associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although the signs and symptoms can be apparent early in the disease course, diagnoses are often made late because of inadequate recognition. A diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis requires careful scrutiny of a patient's symptoms, an electrocardiogram, and imaging studies, including echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging. Further evaluation is required through the measurement of serum and urine light chains and the use of bone scintigraphy imaging to differentiate transthyretin amyloidosis from light-chain cardiac amyloidosis. The available treatments have expanded tremendously in recent years and have improved outcomes in the population with this disorder. Thus, it has become increasingly important to diagnose cardiac amyloidosis and provide timely therapies. This article will clarify the various misconceptions about cardiac amyloidosis and provide a framework for primary care providers to better identify this disease in their practice.

### Noncardiac manifestations of hereditary amyloidosis [^b3943792]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The most common forms of cardiac amyloidosis are progressive, life threatening, and underrecognized. Symptoms affect a variety of organs and overlap with those of more common conditions, complicating and postponing diagnosis. Cardiac disease generally determines mortality, but noncardiac manifestations typically surface before cardiac symptoms, often several years before diagnosis. Familiarity with noncardiac manifestations may lead to early diagnosis, enabling treatment and improving prognosis.

### Addressing common questions encountered in the diagnosis and management of cardiac amyloidosis [^af1c8783]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Advances in cardiac imaging have resulted in greater recognition of cardiac amyloidosis in everyday clinical practice, but the diagnosis continues to be made in patients with late-stage disease, suggesting that more needs to be done to improve awareness of its clinical manifestations and the potential of therapeutic intervention to improve prognosis. Light chain cardiac amyloidosis, in particular, if recognized early and treated with targeted plasma cell therapy, can be managed very effectively. For patients with transthyretin amyloidosis, there are numerous therapies that are currently in late-phase clinical trials. In this review, we address common questions encountered in clinical practice regarding etiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of cardiac amyloidosis, focusing on recent important developments in cardiac imaging and biochemical diagnosis. The aim is to show how a systematic approach to the evaluation of suspected cardiac amyloidosis can impact the prognosis of patients in the modern era.

### Expert consensus recommendations for the suspicion and diagnosis of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis [^57344f14]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiomyopathy is a manifestation of transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), which is an underrecognized systemic disease whereby the transthyretin protein misfolds to form fibrils that deposit in various tissues and organs. ATTR amyloidosis is debilitating and associated with poor life expectancy, especially in those with cardiac dysfunction, but a variety of treatment options have recently become available. Considered a rare disease, ATTR amyloidosis may be more prevalent than thought, particularly in older persons. Diagnosis is often delayed because of a lack of disease awareness and the heterogeneity of symptoms at presentation. Given the recent availability of effective treatments, early recognition and diagnosis are especially critical because treatment is likely more effective earlier in the disease course. The Amyloidosis Research Consortium recently convened a group of experts in ATTR amyloidosis who, through an iterative process, agreed on best practices for suspicion, diagnosis, and characterization of disease. This review describes these consensus recommendations for ATTR associated with cardiomyopathy as a resource to aid cardiologists and others in the recognition and diagnosis of ATTR associated with cardiomyopathy. Included in this review is an overview of red flag signs and symptoms and a recommended diagnostic approach, including testing for monoclonal protein, scintigraphy, or biopsy and, if ATTR associated with cardiomyopathy is identified, TTR genotyping.

### Cardiac amyloidosis for the primary care provider: a practical review to promote earlier recognition of disease [^0c5909df]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis is increasingly recognized as an underdiagnosed cause of heart failure. Diagnostic delays of up to 3 years from symptom onset may occur, and patients may be evaluated by more than 5 specialists prior to receiving the correct diagnosis. Newly available therapies improve clinical outcomes by preventing amyloid fibril deposition and are usually more effective in early stages of disease, making early diagnosis essential. Better awareness among primary care providers of the clinical presentation and modern treatment landscape is essential to improve timely diagnosis and early treatment of this disease. In this review, we provide practical guidance on the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of transthyretin and light chain cardiac amyloidosis to promote earlier disease recognition among primary care providers.

### Cardiac amyloidosis: can advances in diagnostics and treatments improve survival? [^58154a12]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Amyloidosis is a generalised clinical disorder characterised by extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils. Symptomatic cardiac amyloidosis is typically associated with light chain (AL) amyloidosis in the western world. Amyloid deposition in the myocardium causes restrictive cardiomyopathy. Cardiac manifestations affect patient's performance status and limit therapeutic options. We present a case of rapidly progressing cardiac amyloid deposition due to AL amyloidosis presenting with typical features of restrictive cardiomyopathy. We also discuss the advances in non-invasive diagnostic techniques applied in this case and currently available novel treatments. Early diagnosis and better response to novel treatments could potentially improve the overall survival in this group of patients.

### Amyloid transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis with different manifestations, test findings and types [^55d4c6ef]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Amyloid transthyretin amyloidosis usually presents with cardiac amyloidosis manifestations, most commonly with a heart failure syndrome. The history and physical examination offer clues of other cardiac and extracardiac manifestations. Taking a detailed history is essential in elucidating pertinent family and medical history that may increase suspicion for amyloidosis. Further, certain findings on electrocardiogram and imaging should raise suspicion and trigger further workup that can confirm the diagnosis, since treatment is evolving.

### An unusual case of cardiac amyloidosis [^23d006a4]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis can result from any of the systemic amyloidoses. The disease is often characterized by a restrictive cardiomyopathy although the particular signs and symptoms depend in part on the underlying cause. In addition to managing the symptoms of heart failure, treatment options vary depending on the etiology of amyloid deposition. It is therefore critical to identify the cause of cardiac amyloidosis before initiating definitive therapy. We present a patient with presumed immunoglobulin (AL) amyloidosis who had a circulating lambda monoclonal protein, but a bone marrow biopsy with kappa predominant plasma cells. This unusual finding called into question the diagnosis of AL amyloidosis and highlights the importance and difficulty of determining the cause of cardiac amyloid deposition before initiating treatment. We review the different forms of cardiac amyloidosis and propose a diagnostic algorithm to help identify the etiology of cardiac amyloid deposition before beginning therapy.

### AL amyloidosis for cardiologists: awareness, diagnosis, and future prospects: state-of-the-art review [^5286343f]. JACC: CardioOncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a rare, debilitating, often fatal disease. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy are common presenting features, and patients often are referred to cardiologists. Cardiac amyloid infiltration is the leading predictor of death. However, the variable presentation and perceived rarity of the disease frequently lead to delay in suspecting amyloidosis as a cause of heart failure, leading to misdiagnoses and a marked delay in diagnosis, with devastating consequences for the patient. A median time from symptom onset to correct diagnosis of about 2 years is often too long when median survival from diagnosis for patients with AL amyloidosis and cardiomyopathy is 4 months to 2 years. The authors highlight the challenges to diagnosis, identify gaps in the current knowledge, and summarize novel treatments on the horizon to raise awareness about the critical need for early recognition of symptoms and diagnosis of AL amyloidosis aimed at accelerating treatment and improving outcomes for patients.

### Management of cardiac symptoms in amyloidosis [^e71edd12]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) results in symptoms of heart failure, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, conduction disturbances, and profound autonomic dysfunction. These symptoms present unique management challenges as compared with patients without CA, and can be very debilitating. Thus, management of the cardiovascular symptoms of these patients plays a central role in their care. This review presents an overview of the typical cardiovascular manifestations encountered in patients with CA and highlights the key management considerations for each.

### Light-chain cardiac amyloidosis: strategies to promote early diagnosis and cardiac response [^02dd375e]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Delays in diagnosis and treatment likely contribute to the poor life expectancy of patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis despite improved treatments; increased clinical suspicion among cardiologists is needed. Improved survival in patients with less advanced disease highlights that cardiac AL amyloidosis is not a hopeless condition and may be effectively treated. Accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment will ensure patients are not needlessly subjected to standard medications for heart failure that may be ineffective or even harmful. Emerging interventions may specifically target amyloid, potentially improving cardiac function.

Cardiac amyloidosis — diagnostic recommendations with moderate level of consensus state that noncardiac tissue–proven amyloidosis with echocardiographic or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and symptoms and signs of HF can be useful to diagnose cardiac amyloidosis without EMB (Level of Evidence C). In patients suspected of having cardiac amyloidosis, EMB is reasonable to identify amyloid protein in cardiac tissue, especially if there is no noncardiac tissue evidence of amyloidosis (Level of Evidence C). Natriuretic peptide (BNP or N-terminal proBNP) levels can be useful to detect early/preclinical cardiac involvement in amyloidosis and to predict future cardiac involvement and prognosis (Level of Evidence B).

### Cardiac amyloidosis [^f4e53a11]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Amyloidosis is a pathologic and clinical condition resulting from the accumulation of insoluble aggregates of misfolded proteins in tissues. Extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils in the myocardium leads to cardiac amyloidosis, which is often overlooked as a cause of diastolic heart failure. Although cardiac amyloidosis was previously believed to have a poor prognosis, recent advances in diagnosis and treatment have emphasized the importance of early recognition and changed management of this condition. This article provides an overview of cardiac amyloidosis and summarizes current screening, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment options.

### Diagnostic imaging of cardiac amyloidosis [^fa5aba57]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Systemic amyloidosis encompasses a debilitating, under-diagnosed but increasingly recognized group of disorders characterized by the extracellular deposition of misfolded proteins in one or more organs. Cardiac amyloid deposition leads to an infiltrative or restrictive cardiomyopathy and is the major contributor to poor prognosis in patients with systemic amyloidosis. In total, > 30 proteins can form amyloid fibrils, but the two main types of amyloid that can infiltrate the heart are monoclonal immunoglobulin light-chain amyloid and transthyretin amyloid. Cardiac amyloidosis can be acquired in older individuals or inherited from birth. Given the nonspecific symptoms of these disorders, a high index of suspicion is paramount in making the correct diagnosis, which can involve the use of non-invasive imaging methods such as echocardiography, bone scintigraphy and cardiovascular MRI. In the past decade, the use of cardiovascular MRI with tissue characterization and bone scintigraphy to diagnose cardiac amyloidosis has revolutionized our understanding of the disease, leading to changes in patient care. However, a need remains for improved awareness and expertise, and greater clinical suspicion, because the initial clues provided by electrocardiography and echocardiography might not be typical. With specific treatments now available, timely diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis is more important than ever. In this Review, we discuss the current and novel approaches for the diagnostic imaging of cardiac amyloidosis.

### How to image cardiac amyloidosis: a practical approach [^4468a10e]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is one of the most rapidly progressive forms of heart disease, with a median survival from diagnosis, if untreated, ranging from < 6 months for light chain amyloidosis to 3 to 5 years for transthyretin amyloidosis. Early diagnosis and accurate typing of CA are necessary for optimal management of these patients. Emerging novel disease modifying therapies increase the urgency to diagnose CA at an early stage and identify patients who may benefit from these life-saving therapies. The goal of this review is to provide a practical approach to echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, and radionuclide imaging in patients with known or suspected CA.

### Cardiac amyloidosis in older adults with a focus on frailty: JACC: advances expert consensus [^67bd74bf]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Cardiac amyloidosis is common in older adults, and often exists within the context of the known geriatric syndromes. Frailty is a dynamic syndrome that has many overlapping features with the end-organ systems affected by amyloidosis. Importantly, frailty is highly prevalent within the population of patients with amyloidosis, especially those that suffer from ATTM-CM (with or without HF symptoms). Amyloid is now recognized as a treatable condition, with disease modifying therapy available. Frailty itself is also reversible if identified and treated appropriately. Understanding the interplay between frailty, aging, and amyloidosis, therefore, can help our understanding of the pathophysiology of disease, as well as early implementation of frailty assessments and interventions.

### Amyloid heart disease [^b1099cf5]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

The systemic amyloidoses are an uncommon group of disorders characterized by the extracellular deposition of amyloid in one or more organs. Cardiac deposition, leading to an infiltrative/restrictive cardiomyopathy, is a common feature of amyloidosis. It may be the presenting feature of the disease or may be discovered while investigating a patient presenting with non-cardiac amyloidosis. In this article we review the features of cardiac amyloidosis and its varied manifestations. The need for a high index of suspicion and the critical importance of precise biochemical typing of the amyloid deposits is stressed in light of recent advances in therapy which can, when appropriately used, significantly improve prognosis.

### Comprehensive geriatric assessment to Optimize the management of older Patients with transthyretin cardiac Amyloidosis [^85530246]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) predominantly affects older adults with multiple chronic conditions, leading to significant physical, cognitive, and emotional challenges. New disease-modifying drugs are effective in early stages, prompting a shift toward comprehensive assessments, including functional capacity and quality of life. However, these assessments may not fully capture the complexity of older ATTR-CA patients, especially regarding frailty and mood disorders, which can influence symptom reporting. Thus, integrating comprehensive geriatric assessment tools into routine clinical practice may be crucial to detect early signs of frailty or functional impairment that could impact outcomes and mitigate futility and ageism in the decision-making process. This review highlights the importance of evaluating multimorbidity, disability, and frailty in older patients with ATTR-CA to optimize management strategies.

### Cardiac amyloidosis – A review of current literature for the practicing physician [^768c9c5b]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The amyloidoses are a family of diseases in which misfolded precursor proteins aggregate to form amyloid and deposit in body tissues. A very serious yet underrecognized form of this disease is cardiac amyloidosis, in which amyloid deposits into the extracellular space of the myocardium, resulting in thickening and stiffening of ventricular walls with resultant heart failure and conductive dysfunction. This review provides a discussion of the pathogenesis and clinical presentation of cardiac amyloidosis subtypes, as well as an up‐to‐date approach to diagnosis and treatment. Significant progress has been made in recent years regarding diagnosis and treatment of this condition, but prognosis remains heavily reliant on early detection of the disease. Two types of precursor protein are responsible for most cardiac amyloidosis cases: transthyretin amyloid, and immunoglobulin‐derived light chain amyloid. An early diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis can allow for novel treatment modalities to be initiated with the potential to improve prognosis.

### Light-chain cardiac amyloidosis: strategies to promote early diagnosis and cardiac response [^c733a22e]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a systemic disease characterised by the aggregation of misfolded immunoglobulin light chain (LC), predominantly in the heart and kidneys, causing organ failure. If untreated, the median survival of patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis is 6 months from the onset of heart failure. Protracted time to establish a diagnosis, often lasting > 1 year, is a frequent factor in poor treatment outcomes. Cardiologists, to whom patients are often referred, frequently miss the opportunity to diagnose cardiac AL amyloidosis. Nearly all typical cardiac support measures, with the exception of diuretics, are ineffective and may even worsen clinical symptoms, emphasising the need for accurate diagnosis. Patients with severe cardiac involvement face poor outcomes; heart transplantation is rarely an option because of multiorgan involvement, rapid clinical decline and challenges in predicting which patients will respond to treatment of the underlying plasma cell disorder. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment with Ã¢â'¬Ëœsource therapiesÃ¢â'¬â"¢ that limit the production of amyloidogenic LC are associated with better survival and improvement in organ function after a median of 2.4 months following haematological complete response. However, organ recovery is often incomplete because these source therapies do not directly target deposited amyloid. Emerging amyloid-directed therapies may attenuate, and potentially reverse, organ dysfunction by clearing existing amyloid and inhibiting fibril formation of circulating aggregates. Improved recognition of AL amyloidosis by cardiologists allows for earlier treatment and improved outcomes.

The amyloidoses are a family of diseases in which misfolded precursor proteins aggregate to form amyloid and deposit in body tissues.

### Cardiac amyloidosis: where are we today? [^58776e4b]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Systemic amyloidosis is generally considered to be rare, but the heart is frequently involved and is a major determinant of prognosis. New diagnostic imaging methods have recently been developed with the capacity to enhance the accuracy of diagnosis, which will be ever more important with the variety of new treatments on the near horizon. Most cases of cardiac amyloidosis are of either monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain (AL) type, which can occur at any age from young adulthood onwards, or transthyretin (ATTR) type, which can be acquired in elderly individuals or inherited at a younger age. Cardiac involvement is the most serious manifestation of AL amyloidosis, and serum cardiac biomarkers have proved to be of great value in staging disease severity and response to an ever increasing array of chemotherapy agents. Cardiac involvement is the dominant manifestation of nonhereditary ATTR amyloidosis, also known as senile cardiac amyloidosis, the prevalence of which is not known but is probably much greater than currently recognized. A genetic variant in the gene for transthyretin (TTR), which is present in 3–4% of African Americans and probably a similar proportion of black individuals of African descent generally, appears to be associated with increased susceptibility to developing cardiac ATTR amyloidosis in older age. Several novel therapies are in the advanced stages of development for ATTR amyloidosis including TTR protein stabilizers and RNA inhibitors that greatly diminish TTR production. Here, we will review recent developments in the diagnosis and management of cardiac amyloidosis.

Conclusions

Searching for CA in specific settings allows to identify a relatively high number of cases who may be eligible for treatment if the diagnosis is unequivocal (i.e. when there is a combination of evidence of amyloid deposits, structural heart disease, and symptoms of cardiac disease). ATTR‐CA accounts for many cases of CA across the different settings, but AL‐CA is not infrequent and should be searched. Median age at diagnosis falls in the eighth or ninth decades. Many patients diagnosed with CA are women (for example, 36% of cases of CA among patients operated for CTS).

### Cardiac amyloidosis imaging, part 1: amyloidosis etiology and image acquisition [^a168a48d]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2023). Medium credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis is a systemic form of amyloidosis in which protein-based infiltrates are deposited in myocardial extracellular space. The accumulation of amyloid fibrils causes the myocardium to thicken and stiffen, leading to diastolic dysfunction and, eventually, heart failure. Until recently, cardiac amyloidosis was considered rare. However, the recent adoption of noninvasive diagnostic testing, including 99m Tc-pyrophosphate imaging, has revealed a previously undiagnosed sizable disease prevalence. Light-chain amyloidosis (AL) and transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), the 2 primary types, account for 95% of cardiac amyloidosis diagnoses. AL results from plasma cell dyscrasia and has a very poor prognosis. The usual treatment for cardiac AL is chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Cardiac ATTR is more chronic, usually resulting from age-related instability and misfolding of the transthyretin protein. ATTR is treated by managing heart failure and using new pharmacotherapeutic drugs. 99m Tc-pyrophosphate imaging can efficiently and effectively distinguish between ATTR and cardiac AL. Although the exact mechanism of myocardial 99m Tc-pyrophosphate uptake is unknown, it is believed to bind to amyloid plaque microcalcifications. 99m Tc-pyrophosphate imaging has a 97% sensitivity and nearly 100% sensitivity for identifying cardiac ATTR when the AL form of the disease is ruled out through serum free light-chain and serum and urine protein electrophoresis with immunofixation testing. Although there are no published 99m Tc-pyrophosphate cardiac amyloidosis imaging guidelines, the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology, Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, and others have published consensus recommendations to standardize test performance and interpretation. This article, part 1 of a 3-part series in this issue of the Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology, describes amyloidosis etiology and cardiac amyloidosis characteristics, including the types, prevalence, signs and symptoms, and disease course. It further explains the scan acquisition protocol. Part 2 of the series focuses on image/data quantification and technical considerations. Finally, part 3 describes scan interpretation, along with the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac amyloidosis.

Cardiologist identification of patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis

AL amyloidosis may develop in patients with multiple myeloma (10%–15%) or may progress from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) (9%). These disorders are thus important diagnostic considerations; however, AL amyloidosis can be diagnosed in the absence of either disorder. The overall incidence of AL amyloidosis is estimated to be only 8.0–14.4 million persons per year in the USAand suggests that a physician may diagnose only a few cases annually. Nonetheless, based on its prevalence, most cardiologists have encountered patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis. The nature of the patients' cardiac dysfunction may go undiagnosed, however, because symptoms of cardiac AL amyloidosis may mimic those of other restrictive cardiomyopathies, despite their being predominantly caused by AL amyloidosis (see online supplementary table 1).

AL amyloidosis is rarely diagnosed before symptoms appear; the vague, variable signs and symptoms of AL amyloidosis reflect advanced organ manifestation or involvement. Clues to diagnosis include heart failure associated with neuropathy, nephrotic syndrome, hepatomegaly, periorbital bleeding and macroglossia. Cardiac ATTR amyloidosis is also frequently associated with neuropathy, primarily in patients with ATTRm amyloidosis, again highlighting the need for physician awareness in differential diagnosis. For patients with many forms of systemic amyloidosis, diagnosis ≥ 1 year after initial presentation to a physician is, unfortunately, common. It is estimated that one-third of patients may visit five or more physicians before diagnosis. Early detection allows for treatments that can halt cardiac damage, potentially reducing the risk for sudden deathand allowing for spontaneous or therapeutically induced amyloid clearance and improved cardiac function.

The diagnosis of suspected AL amyloidosis, irrespective of organ involvement, involves identification of clonal disease and amyloid typing (figure 2). Serum-free light chain (FLC) should be measured, and serum and urine immunoelectrophoresis should be performed in all patients. If indicated based on initial screening tests, bone marrow biopsy is performed to determine whether plasma cell dyscrasia is present and to determine the percentage and type of λ- or κ-producing plasma cells. Routine use of the immunoglobulin FLC assay in patients with unexplained heart failure may be a relatively efficient, economical and non-invasive means to screen patients with AL amyloidosis. Nonetheless, healthcare providers must recognise that ATTR commonly affects the heart and will not be detected by the serum FLC assay. ATTRwt is an increasingly recognised form of amyloid, particularly in men older than 60 years.

### Redefining cardiac involvement in systemic immunoglobulin AL amyloidosis… [^593e6792]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Cardiac infiltration, present in up to 80% of patients, is the main driver for mortality, 2 with median survival ranging from 2 months to 4 years depending on cardiac disease severity. 3, 4 Serum cardiac biomarkers and echocardiography traditionally used to define the presence of cardiac involvement, 5–7 although prognostically useful, do not directly measure cardiac amyloid infiltration. Among patients fulfilling the criteria for cardiac involvement, CMR with ECV mapping confirmed cardiac amyloid infiltration in most cases but found 27 to 37 patients without cardiac involvement. Conversely, among patients not fulfilling the criteria, CMR with ECV mapping identified cardiac amyloid infiltration in 17 patients to 49 patients.

Figure 1 and eFigure 5 in Supplement 1 show patients' overall survival in the 1-month and 6-month landmark cohorts, stratified by their ECV value and hematological response. This prospective study demonstrates the ability of CMR with ECV mapping in patients with systemic AL amyloidosis to characterize the degree of cardiac involvement, predict long-term outcomes, and inform management strategies. Our study demonstrated the following 3 findings. First, the different approaches currently used to define the presence and severity of cardiac involvement, which included serum biomarkers, echocardiography, and CMR with ECV mapping, produce widely different results. CMR with gadolinium contrast, by isolating the signal from the ECV, provides an accurate measure of myocardial amyloid deposition as a global increase in ECV most likely represents an increase in the amyloid burden.

The ability of ECV mapping to stratify prognosis and independently predict outcomes across various degrees of infiltration, ranging from no amyloid deposits to severe disease, provides a significant advantage in assessing myocardial amyloid load over both cardiac biomarkers and echocardiography.
10. This study found that CMR with ECV mapping has the key advantage of accurately characterizing the presence and extent of cardiac amyloid infiltration compared with both serum cardiac biomarkers and echocardiography. ECV mapping can independently predict overall survival in systemic AL amyloidosis and has the ability to help define hematological response associated with better long-term survival according to the presence and severity of cardiac amyloid infiltration.

Wild-type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTRwt) is now recognized as a common cause of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). In this review, we aim to describe the unique epidemiologic, pathophysiologic, and clinical features associated with ATTwt cardiac amyloidosis. Compared to other etiologies of HFpEF, ATTRwt cardiac amyloidosis affects almost exclusively older adults, demonstrating a characteristic age-dependent penetrance that impacts both the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. In addition, ATTR cardiac amyloidosis demonstrates a unique pathophysiology in contrast to other etiologies of HFpEF, which results in a characteristic phenotype that can raise suspicion for ATTRwt cardiac amyloid in the appropriate demographic. With these distinguishing features in mind, we aim to describe the specific signs, symptoms, and imaging characteristics associated with ATTRwt cardiac amyloidosis, including the role of nuclear scintigraphy that has essentially eliminated the need for biopsy in most patients with suspected disease. Finally, we review the evidence behind the available therapeutic agents, as well as those under investigation, which will change the way we manage older patients with ATTRwt cardiac amyloidosis in the coming years.

Key diagnostic strategies for cardiac amyloidosis — recommendations with strong level of consensus include that in patients suspected of having cardiac and systemic amyloidosis, identification of amyloid protein in specified tissues or affected organs is recommended to diagnose amyloidosis (Level of Evidence C). If TTR amyloid is detected from a biopsy specimen, DNA mutational analysis should be used to differentiate between senile and hereditary amyloidosis (Level of Evidence C). When the diagnosis of amyloidosis has been established, imaging and further laboratory studies or biopsies should be considered to identify the organs involved (Level of Evidence C), and the extent of organ involvement is critical in determining treatment strategies and prognosis. Echocardiography should be performed in patients suspected of having cardiac amyloidosis or patients with systemic amyloidosis and HF (Level of Evidence B).

### Cardiac amyloidosis: an update on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^8aa09735]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The amyloidoses are a group of systemic diseases characterized by organ deposition of misfolded protein fragments of diverse origins. The natural history of the disease, involvement of other organs, and treatment options vary significantly based on the protein of origin. In AL amyloidosis, amyloid protein is derived from immunoglobulin light chains, and most often involves the kidneys and the heart. ATTR amyloidosis is categorized as mutant or wild-type depending on the genetic sequence of the transthyretin (TTR) protein produced by the liver. Wild-type ATTR amyloidosis mainly involves the heart, although the reported occurrence of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, spinal stenosis and biceps tendon rupture in these patients speaks to more generalized protein deposition. Mutant TTR is marked by cardiac and/or peripheral nervous system involvement. Cardiac involvement is associated with symptoms of heart failure, and dictates the clinical course of the disease. Cardiac amyloidosis can be diagnosed noninvasively by echocardiography, cardiac MRI, or nuclear scintigraphy. Endomyocardial biopsy may be needed in the case of equivocal imaging findings or discordant data. Treatment is aimed at relieving congestive symptoms and targeting the underlying amyloidogenic process. This includes anti-plasma cell therapy in AL amyloidosis, and stabilization of the TTR tetramer or inhibition of TTR protein production in ATTR amyloidosis. Cardiac transplantation can be considered in highly selected patients in tandem with therapy aimed at suppressing the amyloidogenic process, and appears associated with durable long-term survival.

Knowledge About Diagnosis of Cardiac Amyloidosis

Overall, the survey indicated a high level of perceived awareness about cardiac amyloidosis, with 82.7% of participants considering themselves to be "somewhat or extremely familiar" with signs and symptoms of cardiac amyloidosis. However, survey respondents did not suspect the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis frequently enough, with 61.4% having suspected this diagnosis less than once a month on average and another 25.0% who had never suspected cardiac amyloidosis in patients they evaluated. Furthermore, when asked about disease processes considered during the evaluation of patients with HF and preserved ejection fraction, amyloidosis, with a mean response of 3.6 ± 1.5, was less likely to be considered by survey participants compared with hypertension (4.4 ± 0.9), diabetes (4.1 ± 1.0), and obesity (3.8 ± 1.2).

Importantly, the survey identified gaps in physicians' knowledge about the role of noninvasive modalities in diagnosing amyloid heart disease. Whereas echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging were believed to be useful for the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis by 82.0% and 91.9% of survey participants, respectively, only 60.5% of physicians considered cardiac scintigraphy with bone-avid radiotracers to be useful, while 33.3% were unsure of the role of this modality in confirming cardiac amyloidosis diagnosis. Moreover, the survey uncovered significant gaps in the perceived importance of laboratory studies to exclude monoclonal protein abnormalities, with 52.9% of participants reporting serum and urine electrophoresis to be extremely useful, whereas serum free light-chain assays and immunofixation studies (serum and urine) were considered useful by 49.4% and 41.9% of survey participants, respectively. Urine free light-chain assay, not routinely obtained for evaluation of plasma cell dyscrasias, was believed to be useful by 42.1% of physicians completing the survey.

### Expert consensus on the monitoring of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^39a528a0]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a life-threatening condition with a heterogeneous clinical presentation. The recent availability of treatment for ATTR-CM has stimulated increased awareness of the disease and patient identification. Stratification of patients with ATTR-CM is critical for optimal management and treatment; however, monitoring disease progression is challenging and currently lacks best-practice guidance. In this report, experts with experience in treating amyloidosis and ATTR-CM developed consensus recommendations for monitoring the course of patients with ATTR-CM and proposed meaningful thresholds and frequency for specific parameters. A set of 11 measurable features across three separate domains were evaluated: (i) clinical and functional endpoints, (ii) biomarkers and laboratory markers, and (iii) imaging and electrocardiographic parameters. Experts recommended that one marker from each of the three domains provides the minimum requirements for assessing disease progression. Assessment of cardiac disease status should be part of a multiparametric evaluation in which progression, stability or improvement of other involved systems in transthyretin amyloidosis should also be considered. Additional data from placebo arms of clinical trials and future studies assessing ATTR-CM will help to elucidate, refine and define these and other measurements.

The number of studies on some settings was low, not allowing a meta‐analytic assessment, while on other settings the degree of heterogeneity was high. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to conclude that screening strategies are most likely to detect CA in men and women in their 70s or 80s displaying (i) heart failure symptoms or conduction disorders, (ii) CTS with indication for surgery, unexplained or out of proportion LV thickening, or severe AS. There is a crucial need to identify the most cost‐effective strategies for CA identification in different settings. Large‐scale surveys considering the clinical and echocardiographic phenotype and the combination of red flags, such as the nationwide ongoing AC‐TIVE study, are crucial to achieve this goal.

### Multimodality imaging in the evaluation and management of cardiac amyloidosis [^8c6824b3]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Systemic amyloidosis is a heterogeneous group of disorders where misfolded proteins deposit in the various organs as nonbranching fibrils with a β-pleated-sheet structure called amyloid. Extensive extracellular deposition of these amyloid fibrils eventually leads to organ dysfunction. Involvement of the heart, termed as cardiac amyloidosis, leads to heart failure if left untreated and carries high morbidity and mortality. Current interest in cardiac amyloidosis is growing rapidly thanks to the recent development of effective targeted treatment options, driving the need for better and earlier detection of the condition, which is largely underdiagnosed and far commoner than recognized. Timely diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis is challenging, but is poised to improve with emergence of newer noninvasive imaging techniques, potentially obviating the need for endomyocardial biopsy in some patients and providing prognostic information. With recent advances in the therapeutic options for cardiac amyloidosis, an area of immense interest is the adoption of imaging as biomarkers for longitudinal assessment of disease progression and treatment response. In this article, we provide an overview of cardiac amyloidosis, discuss the role of imaging modalities in cardiac amyloidosis, and explore future directions for imaging in cardiac amyloidosis.

### Cardiac amyloidosis due to transthyretin protein… [^0e55437c]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance Systemic amyloidosis from transthyretin protein is the most common type of amyloidosis that causes cardiomyopathy. Observations. Transthyretin protein transports thyroxine and retinol and is synthesized predominantly by the liver. When the TTR protein misfolds, it can form amyloid fibrils that deposit in the heart causing heart failure, heart conduction block, or arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation. The biological processes by which amyloid fibrils form are incompletely understood but are associated with aging and, in some patients, affected by inherited variants in the TTR genetic sequence. ATTR amyloidosis results from misfolded TTR protein deposition. ATTR can occur in association with normal TTR genetic sequence or with abnormal TTR genetic sequence. Wild-type ATTR primarily manifests as cardiomyopathy while ATTR due to a genetic variant manifests as cardiomyopathy and/or polyneuropathy.

Approximately 50 000 to 150 000 people in the US have heart failure due to ATTR amyloidosis. Without treatment, heart failure due to ATTR amyloidosis is associated with a median survival of approximately 5 years. The diagnosis can be made using serum free light chain assay and immunofixation electrophoresis to exclude light chain amyloidosis combined with cardiac nuclear scintigraphy to detect radiotracer uptake in a pattern consistent with amyloidosis. Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, torsemide, and bumetanide, are the primary treatment for fluid overload and symptomatic relief of patients with ATTR heart failure. An ATTR-directed therapy that inhibited misfolding of the TTR protein, compared with placebo, reduced mortality from 42. 9% to
29. 5%, reduced hospitalizations from 0. 7/year to
0. 48/year, and was most effective when administered early in disease course.

Conclusions and Relevance ATTR amyloidosis causes cardiomyopathy in up to approximately 150 000 people in the US and tafamidis is the only currently approved therapy. Tafamidis slowed progression of ATTR amyloidosis and improved survival and prevented hospitalization, compared with placebo, in people with ATTR-associated cardiomyopathy.

"Amyloidosis" refers to a group of diseases which are frequently underrecognized and misdiagnosed, resulting in inadequate management and inefficient resource utilization. These diseases differ in etiology, (and to a degree, presentation) but share a common gross and microscopic appearance. 1

Amyloidosis is the consequence of the extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils (aggregates of insoluble low molecular‐weight protein subunits). The deposition of amyloid can occur at a variety of sites, the particulars of which are determined by the etiology of the amyloidosis. 2

Several types of amyloidosis have been described based on the specific protein comprising the deposited fibrils (Table 1). The most pertinent forms of the disease in the setting of cardiac amyloidosis are transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) and immunoglobulin‐derived light chain amyloidosis (AL). It is uncommon for secondary (AA) amyloidosis to affect the heart and this is rarely seen in developed countries where severe chronic inflammatory processes are generally well managed. 3

TABLE 1
Type of amyloidosis characterized by precursor protein, cardiac and extracardiac manifestations

Cardiac amyloidosis most commonly occurs in the setting of systemic amyloidosis with multi‐organ involvement, although isolated cardiac amyloidosis has been described. Cardiac amyloidosis can progress quickly with rapid myocardial wall thickening and progression to congestive cardiac failure. 4

Despite the ongoing development of new treatment modalities, the prognosis of amyloidosis (especially with cardiac involvement) remains poor. This is particularly the case when the diagnosis is missed on first presentation and is only determined once the myocardium has suffered irreparable damage, as the patient is often too unwell to survive treatment. 4 Therefore an understanding of cardiac amyloidosis and a high index of suspicion is essential in the improvement of the prognosis of these patients.

Cardiac amyloidosis — initial evaluation and imaging/ECG indicators emphasize an iterative process and early diagnosis. "An iterative process of diagnosis" is outlined, and clinicians are advised that "diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis requires a high index of suspicion because the diagnosis cannot be established on the basis of routine testing alone"; once suspected, "the goal is to obtain an early and rapid diagnosis as early initiation of therapy can prevent further amyloid deposition and further end-organ damage". The diagnostic process begins with "clinical history/examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and transthoracic echocardiogram", where "Discordance between QRS voltage and wall thickness seen on echocardiogram is a well-recognized feature" and "the lack of low QRS voltage on ECG by commonly applied criteria is only present in about 30% of patients with cardiac amyloidosis, and its absence does not exclude the diagnosis". Echocardiographic clues include "increased left ventricular wall thickness (above the sex-specific upper limit of normal and typically ≥ 1.2 cm) as well as other features such as atrioventricular valve/right ventricle free wall/intraatrial septum thickening, diastolic dysfunction, decreased mitral annular systolic velocity (s'), biatrial enlargement".

Amyloidosis is a clinical disease process characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils within the extracellular space of various organs. Amyloid fibrils are formed when proteins with an unstable tertiary structure misfold into insoluble beta-pleated sheets, resistant to proteolysis, that subsequently aggregate and deposit within the extracellular matrix. Disease occurs when the accumulation of amyloid fibrils disrupts the structure, integrity, and function of the affected organ.

Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) occurs when amyloid fibrils accumulate within the myocardium, causing interruption and distortion of myocardial contractile elements. The overwhelming majority of CA cases result from misfolded light-chain (light-chain amyloidosis [AL]) and transthyretin (transthyretin amyloidosis [ATTR]) proteins, although less common causes such as apolipoprotein AI amyloidosis (AApoAI) and apolipoprotein AIV amyloidosis (AApoAIV) are increasingly being recognized. Despite differences in prevalence, clinical phenotype, prognosis, and treatment strategies across this heterogenous group of diseases, cardiac involvement is consistently the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. –

### Cardiac amyloidosis imaging, part 3: interpretation, diagnosis, and treatment [^ee1a51d1]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2023). Medium credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis was thought to be rare, undiagnosable, and incurable. However, recently it has been discovered to be common, diagnosable, and treatable. This knowledge has led to a resurgence in nuclear imaging with 99m Tc-pyrophosphate-a scan once believed to be extinct-to identify cardiac amyloidosis, particularly in patients with heart failure but preserved ejection fraction. The renewed interest in 99m Tc-pyrophosphate imaging has compelled technologists and physicians to reacquaint themselves with the procedure. Although 99m Tc-pyrophosphate imaging is relatively simple, interpretation and diagnostic accuracy require an in-depth knowledge of amyloidosis etiology, clinical manifestations, disease progression, and treatment. Diagnosing cardiac amyloidosis is complicated because typical signs and symptoms are nonspecific and usually attributed to other cardiac disorders. In addition, physicians must be able to differentiate between monoclonal immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis (AL) and transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR). Several clinical and noninvasive diagnostic imaging (echocardiography and cardiac MRI) red flags have been identified that suggest a patient may have cardiac amyloidosis. The intent of these red flags is to raise physician suspicion of cardiac amyloidosis and guide a series of steps (a diagnostic algorithm) for narrowing down and diagnosing the specific amyloid type. One element in the diagnostic algorithm is to identify monoclonal proteins indicative of AL. Monoclonal proteins are detected by serum or urine immunofixation electrophoresis and serum free light-chain assay. Another element is identifying and grading cardiac amyloid deposition using 99m Tc-pyrophosphate imaging. When monoclonal proteins are present and the 99m Tc-pyrophosphate scan is positive, the patient should be further evaluated for cardiac AL. The absence of monoclonal proteins and a positive 99m Tc-pyrophosphate scan is diagnostic for cardiac ATTR. Patients with cardiac ATTR need to undergo genetic testing to differentiate between wild-type ATTR and variant ATTR. This article is the third in a 3-part series in this issue of the Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology Part 1 reviewed amyloidosis etiology and outlined 99m Tc-pyrophosphate study acquisition. Part 2 described 99m Tc-pyrophosphate image quantification and protocol technical considerations. This article discusses scan interpretation along with cardiac amyloidosis diagnosis and treatment.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published June 26, 2024 The survival of patients with systemic light chain amyloidosis is dependent on the severity of cardiac dysfunction at the time of diagnosis. Patients who receive a diagnosis late in the clinical course of the disorder have a median survival of 3 to 6 months, whereas patients without cardiac involvement can survive for many years. Read the NEJM Review Article here. Clinical Pearls Q: Describe the pathogenesis of AL amyloidosis. A: Amyloidosis comprises a group of diseases triggered by the misfolding of a soluble precursor protein. This misfolding leads to the formation of oligomers, aggregates, and amyloid fibrils characterized by pleated β-sheets, which are deposited extracellularly in various organs and tissues. The result is progressive organ dysfunction, organ failure, and eventual death.

Organ dysfunction is due to the disruption of architecture caused by amyloid deposits, direct cytotoxic effects from protein aggregates or oligomers, or both. AL amyloidosis is associated with a clonal plasma cell dyscrasia and is caused by abnormal or excessive production of amyloidogenic immunoglobulin light chains, which aggregate into oligomers and amyloid fibrils, leading to organ dysfunction. Q: Is systemic AL amyloidosis readily diagnosed. A: Nonspecific symptoms linked to AL amyloidosis often contribute to diagnostic delays. Consideration of AL amyloidosis is crucial in patients with unexplained proteinuria, restrictive cardiomyopathy, peripheral neuropathy with autonomic features, carpal tunnel syndrome in both wrists, or hepatomegaly without imaging abnormalities and in any patient with a monoclonal gammopathy or multiple myeloma with atypical manifestations such as macroglossia or raccoon eyes. A high index of suspicion is essential to prevent delays in diagnosis.

A: The diagnosis of AL amyloidosis requires evidence of amyloid deposits in tissue and evidence of a plasma cell dyscrasia. Tissue amyloid deposits show green birefringence when stained with Congo red dye and viewed with the use of polarized light microscopy. Fine-needle aspiration of abdominal fat is a simple procedure that is positive for amyloid deposits in approximately 70 to 75% of patients with AL amyloidosis.

### Cardiac amyloidosis: a practical approach to diagnosis and management [^13f1d64e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis, the primary determinant of prognosis in systemic amyloidoses, is characterized by infiltration of myocardium by amyloid protein resulting in cardiomyopathy and conduction disturbances. Cardiac involvement is primarily encountered in immunoglobulin (AL) and transthyretin-associated (hereditary/familial and senile) amyloidoses. Although the latter variants could be indolent, untreated AL amyloidosis with clinical cardiac involvement is a rapidly fatal disease. The management decisions of cardiac amyloidosis are based on the underlying cause. Although treatment of senile systemic amyloidosis is largely supportive, the therapeutic approaches for AL amyloidosis include chemotherapy, autologous stem cell transplantation, and, rarely, cardiac transplantation. The familial variant is potentially curable with a liver ± cardiac transplantation. This narrative review outlines a practical approach to these challenging diagnoses in the face of rapidly evolving management strategies.

Discussion — diagnostic evolution and implications in cardiac amyloidosis — As recently as 10 to 15 years ago cardiac amyloidosis was not routinely considered as a diagnosis to explain the etiology of heart failure (HF); the advent of an accurate, noninvasive imaging means to diagnose ATTR cardiac amyloidosis facilitated enhanced recognition of ATTR amyloidosis and its prevalence among patients with HFpEF and AS, and testing for ATTR amyloidosis has identified unrecognized cases of AL amyloidosis. Development of effective therapies to improve survival in patients with both AL and ATTR amyloidosis makes understanding diagnosis and management paramount, and the document emphasizes that the disease is more common than previously thought, has multisystem manifestations requiring appropriate referral to skilled subspecialists, and that although noninvasive diagnosis of ATTR cardiac amyloidosis appears potentially straightforward, diagnostic pitfalls may result in misdiagnosis with catastrophic consequences.

### Clinical phenotype and prognosis of asymptomatic patients with transthyretin cardiac amyloid infiltration [^9e3dbac6]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Patients with transthyretin (ATTR) cardiac amyloid infiltration are increasingly diagnosed at earlier disease stages with no heart failure (HF) symptoms and a wide range of cardiac amyloid infiltration.

Objective

To characterize the clinical phenotype and natural history of asymptomatic patients with ATTR cardiac amyloid infiltration.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study analyzed data of all patients at 12 international centers for amyloidosis from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2023. Inclusion criteria were asymptomatic ATTR cardiac amyloid infiltration, defined as an absence of HF history, HF signs and symptoms, diuretic therapy, and plasma cell dyscrasia with evidence of myocardial uptake on bone scintigraphy. If plasma cell dyscrasia was present, histologic confirmation of ATTR amyloid was required.

Exposure

Asymptomatic ATTR cardiac amyloid infiltration.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcomes were all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. The secondary outcomes were unplanned HF hospitalization, unplanned CV-related hospitalization, and a composite outcome of CV mortality and HF hospitalization.

Results

The study comprised 485 patients with asymptomatic ATTR cardiac amyloid infiltration (mean [SD] age, 74.9 [9.9] years, 85.8% male, 112 [23.1%] with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis), with 369 (76.1%) having grade 2 or 3 and 116 (23.9%) having grade 1 cardiac uptake at baseline. Patients with grade 2 or 3 uptake exhibited significantly more cardiac functional and structural abnormalities vs patients with grade 1 uptake. At 3 years, compared with grade 1 uptake, patients with grade 2 or 3 uptake had greater development of HF (54.3% [95% CI, 47.7%-61.3%] vs 23.1% [95% CI, 14.8%-35.1%]), greater outpatient diuretic initiation and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide progression (35.0% [95% CI, 28.0%-43.2%] vs 12.4% [95% CI, 6.3%-23.7%]), and greater HF hospitalization (8.7% [95% CI, 5.9%-12.9%] vs 0%) and unplanned CV hospitalization (20.0% [95% CI, 15.7%-25.3%] vs 4.3% [95% CI, 1.6%-11.3%]). Over a median follow-up of 37 months (IQR, 20–64 months), the all-cause death rate was similar between patients with grade 1 vs 2 and 3 uptake; however, those with grade 2 or 3 compared with grade 1 uptake had a significantly higher risk of CV mortality (unadjusted hazard ratio, 5.30; 95% CI, 1.92–14.65).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study shows that asymptomatic ATTR cardiac amyloid infiltration encompasses a wide spectrum of disease severity, with patients with grade 2 or 3 cardiac uptake experiencing an increased rate of CV events and CV mortality and patients with grade 1 uptake experiencing a lower CV event rate and predominantly non-CV mortality. These findings support the use of disease-modifying treatments in asymptomatic patients with grade 2 or 3 uptake and highlight the need of large-scale studies to assess their role in grade 1 uptake.

Overview of cardiac amyloidosis — etiology, cardiac involvement, survival, and prevalence are summarized as follows: Most cases arise from amyloid immunoglobulin light chain (AL) or amyloid transthyretin (ATTR), with ATTR further subtyped into wild-type (ATTRwt) or hereditary (ATTRv). Cardiac involvement in systemic AL amyloidosis is common (up to 75%, depending on diagnostic criteria), and in ATTR amyloidosis is described as the dominant clinical feature seen in all cases. AL amyloidosis is rapidly progressive and, if untreated, the median survival is less than 6 months. Systemic AL amyloidosis is rare, affecting approximately 8 to 12 per million person years, with reports as high as 40.5 per million person years in 2015.

AL amyloidosis — organ involvement and distinguishing manifestations from ATTR include that the heart and the kidneys are the 2 most frequently affected organs in systemic AL amyloidosis, leading to restrictive CM and proteinuria respectively; common AL signs include macroglossia/submandibular gland enlargement, periorbital purpura, and coagulopathy from acquired factor X deficiency; in contrast, musculoskeletal manifestations such as biceps tendon rupture and spinal stenosis are most often indicative of ATTR amyloidosis; organ systems affected by both include the heart, GI tract, and nervous system.

### Is It time for population-based screening for transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis? [^7d5a6e7a]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

In this issue of JACC: Advances, Tini et alcompared outcomes in patients diagnosed with cardiac amyloidosis before and after the introduction of the now widely used noninvasive diagnostic algorithm for transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis. This retrospective study of 887 adults with cardiac amyloidosis showed that those diagnosed after 2016 had less severe heart failure symptoms and were less likely to have restrictive filling patterns on echocardiography at the time of diagnosis. There was substantial and significantly reduced hazard of death and heart failure hospitalization in the patients diagnosed after 2016 compared to those diagnosed before 2016. The authors emphasize the impact of noninvasive diagnostic algorithms as well as heightened awareness and a proactive approach to a condition that did not have any disease-modifying therapies prior to 2016.

With effective diagnostic approaches and timely initiation of disease-modifying therapy which have led to improved outcomes, population-based screening has emerged as an important consideration. To date, therapeutic options for TTR cardiac amyloidosis can forestall progression but cannot reverse existing pathology. This underscores the importance of diagnosing TTR cardiac amyloidosis as early as possible — with early diagnosis, there is ample opportunity for patients to derive benefit from currently (and soon to be) approved therapies such as TTR stabilizers and silencers. Given the field's imperative to identify cardiac amyloidosis as early as possible and a broad recognition that TTR cardiac amyloidosis is not as rare as once thought, population-based screening efforts could further improve the health of the population most vulnerable to TTR cardiac amyloidosis — older adults.

### Updates in cardiac amyloidosis: a review [^e7c1f8c1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Systemic amyloidosis is a relatively rare multisystem disease caused by the deposition of misfolded protein in various tissues and organs. It may present to almost any specialty, and diagnosis is frequently delayed. Cardiac involvement is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in primary light chain (AL) amyloidosis and in both wild-type and hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. The heart is also occasionally involved in acquired serum amyloid A type (AA) amyloidosis and other rare hereditary types. Clinical phenotype varies greatly between different types of amyloidosis, and even the cardiac presentation has a great spectrum. The incidence of amyloidosis is uncertain, but it is thought that the most frequently diagnosed AL amyloidosis has an annual incidence of 6 to 10 cases per million population in the United Kingdom and United States. Amyloidosis due to transthyretin deposition (ATTR) can be wild-type transthyretin amyloid deposits, which predominantly accumulate in the heart and are very common at autopsy in the elderly. Although the associated clinical syndrome known as senile systemic amyloidosis is diagnosed rarely in life, there is increasing evidence that this disorder is much underdiagnosed and that with increasing longevity and improved diagnostic methods it may be identified as a substantial public health problem.

This review focuses on recent progress in the field: novel diagnostic and surveillance approaches using imaging (echocardiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance), biomarkers (brain natriuretic peptide [BNP], high-sensitivity troponin), new histological typing techniques, and current and future treatments, including approaches directly targeting the amyloid deposits.

Introduction

Cardiac amyloidosis arises from deposition of misfolded proteins in the heart muscle, which results in a restrictive-type cardiomyopathy, and commonly progresses to heart failure, conduction system disease, and cardiac death. Cardiac amyloidosis is subclassified based on the specific protein involved, with the major subtypes being transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR cardiac amyloidosis), caused by misfolding of the transthyretin protein, and light chain amyloidosis (AL cardiac amyloidosis), caused by accumulation of immunoglobulin light chains. Cardiac amyloidosis was previously believed to be rare, but recent reports have suggested that it is largely underdiagnosed –. The imperative of identifying patients has dramatically increased with the advent of therapies for specific forms of cardiac amyloidosis –.

The clinical manifestations of cardiac amyloidosis — including conduction system disease, vitreous opacity, carpal tunnel syndrome, orthostatic hypotension, polyneuropathy, spinal stenosis, kidney dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, heart failure — are also commonplace in aging, thus making detection challenging. These signs and symptoms are distributed across multiple organs and tissues (and therefore medical disciplines), and the probabilistic weighting of so many different features is forbidding, even in the unlikely event that all of the relevant exam findings, medical history details and diagnostic test results were available to a given practitioner. Furthermore, definitive diagnostic tests for cardiac amyloidosis — which include tissue biopsy and some forms of radionuclide scintigraphy — are costly and have associated risk, and thus are not plausible as screening approaches.

Cardiac amyloidosis nonetheless has predictive features captured by less expensive and more widely available diagnostic modalities such as electrocardiography – (ECG) and echocardiography, but the features themselves are not highly specific and thus often missed. Also, some of the recently highlighted echocardiographic features require providers to master specialized software packages, which are time-consuming to use and therefore tend to be employed in practice only after the disease is suspected. A truly generalizable detection strategy should require no specialized acquisition or processing and should rely on only widely available input data. However, the low existing prevalence of the disease places high demands on model performance to reduce the rate of costly false positives, something that has not been achieved to date.

Here, we show a human-interpretation-free machine learning pipeline that accurately detects cardiac amyloidosis using a combination of ECG and echocardiography across multiple institutions.

### Cardiac amyloidosis: diagnosis and treatment strategies [^f5290abf]. Current Oncology Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis in the United States is most often due to myocardial infiltration by immunoglobulin protein, such as in AL amyloidosis, or by the protein transthyretin, such as in hereditary and senile amyloidosis. Cardiac amyloidosis often portends a poor prognosis especially in patients with systemic AL amyloidosis. Despite better understanding of the pathophysiology of amyloid, many patients are still diagnosed late in the disease course. This review investigates the current understanding and new research on the diagnosis and treatment strategies in patients with cardiac amyloidosis. Myocardial amyloid infiltration distribution occurs in a variety of patterns. Structural and functional changes on echocardiography can suggest presence of amyloid, but CMR and nuclear imaging provide important complementary information on amyloid burden and the amyloid subtype, respectively. While for AL amyloid, treatment success largely depends on early diagnosis, for ATTR amyloid, new investigational agents that reduce production of transthyretin protein may have significant impact on clinical outcomes. Advancements in the non-invasive diagnostic detection and improvements in early disease recognition will undoubtedly facilitate a larger proportion of patients to receive early therapy when it is most effective.

Immunoglobulin Light Chain Amyloidosis and Cardiac Involvement

Immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a rare, multisystemic, and phenotypically heterogenous disorder, affecting cardiac, renal, neurological, and gastrointestinal systems to varying degrees in different patients. AL amyloidosis is caused by a monoclonal plasma cell disorder characterized by misfolding of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains which leads to aggregation and deposition of insoluble amyloid fibrils in target organs. Deposition of amyloid fibrils in target organs and chemotherapeutic regimens to treat the underlying plasma cell dyscrasia significantly and broadly impact health-related quality of life (HRQOL). –

AL amyloidosis is the most common type of systemic amyloidosis seen in specialized centers with an estimated annual incidence between 3 and 12.7 per million person-years and annual prevalence ranging between 20 and 58 per million person-years. The median age at diagnosis is ≈65 years. The impact of AL amyloidosis is often devastating. For the estimated 76% of patients with cardiac involvement, the ability to perform daily activities is impaired both by symptoms related left heart failure (eg, orthostatic hypotension, syncope, progressive shortness of breath and pulmonary edema) as well as symptoms related to right heart failure (eg, hepatic and intestinal vascular engorgement and peripheral edema). Many standard treatments for congestive heart failure (eg, β-blockers, ACE [angiotensin-converting enzyme] inhibitors, ARB [angiotensin receptor blocker], and ARNIs [angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors]) are either contraindicated or poorly tolerated in patients with AL amyloidosis, especially at high doses. Cardiac damage may be irreversible and contribute to ongoing morbidity and mortality despite achieving a complete hematologic response. The median overall survival of patients with advanced cardiac involvement is < 12 months.

The following constitutes key background information on cardiac amyloidosis:

- **Definition**: Cardiac amyloidosis refers to infiltration of the heart muscle by amyloid proteins, resulting in cardiomyopathy.
- **Pathophysiology**: Cardiac amyloidosis is caused by extracellular accumulation of misfolded protein fragments (immunoglobulin light-chain and transthyretin protein) in the heart muscle.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations are related to the development of restrictive cardiomyopathy and include angina, myocardial infarction, and HF. An increased risk of thromboembolic complications is also present.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Unadjusted 5-year mortality rates are estimated at 65% in patients with AL cardiac amyloidosis and 44% in patients with ATTR cardiac amyloidosis.

### Heart failure: don't forget the role of amyloidosis… [^4eb65823]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Heart failure is defined as the inability of the heart to provide sufficient output to meet the needs of the body. It can occur in the course of a myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, hypertension, etc. Its frequency increases with age. It is a major public health problem. Heart failure first appears during exercise, then at rest. Initially, the heart tries to adapt to the loss of its contraction force by accelerating its beats, then it increases in volume. This extra workload for the heart eventually leads to heart failure. Early detection of amyloidosis appears essential for the implementation of appropriate therapies and therefore for an improvement in patient survival. For this it seems important to better specify the frequency of cardiac amyloidosis in heart failure in the French West Indies. The heart supplies the organs with oxygen and nutrient-rich blood.

During exercise, the heart adapts by increasing the rate of contraction and the rate of blood flow. It is a serious disease with a median survival of 2 to 6 years depending on the study and is often under-diagnosed with late detection at the time of a major cardiovascular event, such as a stroke or acute heart failure. Screening is done by imaging. According to a study carried out in the Cardiology Department of the Martinique University Hospital, one out of three left ventricular hypertrophy, diagnosed by echocardiography, is amyloidosis. A study published by Thibaud Damy's team in 2015 already found a 5% prevalence of TTR gene mutation in patients with LVH. The study hypothesise is that cardiac amyloidosis is as common, or more common, in acute heart failure in the French West Indies than elsewhere.

A systematic screening for amyloidosis in all patients with acute heart failure would allow early initiation of appropriate treatment and improve their long-term outcome. Radiation: Patient with no ventricular hypertrophy

Systemic light chain amyloidosis — initial diagnostic workup and imaging: The workup of patients with suspected amyloidosis is geared towards demonstration of the amyloid fibrils in tissue, identification of the protein of origin, and in the setting of light chain amyloidosis demonstration of the monoclonal plasma cell disorder, and subsequent workup is geared towards identifying the organs involved and the severity of organ involvement and assessment of the feasibility and safety of different treatment approaches. The initial diagnostic workup includes a detailed history and physical (H&P) examination, evaluation of orthostatic vital signs, and careful evaluation for the pathognomonic signs of amyloidosis. In the setting of a monoclonal process, imaging with whole-body low-dose CT scan or FDG-PET/CT can detect osteolytic bone lesions. A skeletal survey is acceptable in certain circumstances (ie, limited access to health care resources), but it is significantly less sensitive than whole-body low-dose CT and FDG-PET/CT; if FDG-PET/CT or whole-body low-dose CT has been performed, then a skeletal survey is not needed. Electrocardiogram (ECG) may demonstrate low voltages and rhythm abnormalities, especially in the setting of cardiac amyloidosis.

This report discusses an unusual case of cardiac amyloidosis. We report a patient who presented with unexplained ascites on a background of stable hypertension and mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction, cardiovascular complaints commonly associated with age. Due to the unspecific nature of his cardiovascular symptoms, it took 2years of recurrent, unresolved ascites, numerous investigations, shifting differential diagnoses and significant cardiovascular deterioration before cardiac amyloidosis was recognised, by which the disease was at end stage. This case emphasises the need for more discriminating clinical features in the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis and advocates unexplained, recurrent ascites as a possible candidate.

AL and ATTR cardiac amyloidosis — epidemiology and diagnostic advances: AL amyloidosis is estimated to have an annual incidence of 1 in 75,000 to 100,000 and a prevalence of 1 in 25,000, and approximately 75% of patients with AL have some degree of cardiac involvement. Observational studies indicate that ATTR-CM may be under-recognized in a significant proportion of patients with heart failure (HF). Imaging techniques and monoclonal light chain testing now allow for accurate noninvasive diagnosis of ATTR-CM in the proper clinical context without the need for confirmatory endomyocardial biopsies, and timely diagnosis will allow prompt implementation of therapeutic interventions that may improve survival, physical function, and/or quality of life.

### Cardiac amyloidosis: expanding awareness to optimize diagnosis [^cb8c36da]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

THAOS is the largest global, longitudinal, observational registry of patients with ATTR amyloidosis, initiated in 2007 and comprising 53 centers from 15 countries. The authors examined 1,251 patients with ATTRwt amyloidosis and made several important observations. First, while 17.1% of patients with ATTRwt amyloidosis were under 70 years of age, 23.3% of them had New York Heart Association functional class 3 to 4 symptoms. This suggests that younger patients were not diagnosed until they developed more advanced disease, perhaps due to less awareness of amyloidosis as a potential diagnosis in younger patients.

A second important observation is that while most patients with ATTRwt amyloidosis were men, the proportion of women increased with age from 4.1% in patients under 70 years of age to 14.3% in patients 90 years of age or greater. In fact, the longest median time from symptom onset to diagnosis was in women 70 years of age, with a delay in diagnosis of 5.2 years.

A third important finding was that women with ATTRwt amyloidosis had lower left ventricular wall thickness than men, though not when wall thickness was indexed by height. This observation suggests that a sex-specific wall thickness threshold for diagnosis may be necessary to avoid underdiagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis in women.

While these findings are compelling, the limitations of the current analysis must be addressed. Of the 1,251 patients included in the analysis, only 7 were women under 70 years of age and only 5 were women aged 90 years or older. So while numerical trends may be observed, further studies are needed to confirm these findings, especially as other studies have not demonstrated sex-specific differences in disease presentation, progression, or prognosis.

Nonetheless, there are important lessons for clinicians from this analysis. If woman under the age of 70 presents with heart failure symptoms and increased left ventricular wall thickness on echocardiogram, particularly increased wall thickness indexed to height, clinicians should not discount a diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis. Often, there are other helpful clinical clues suggesting the diagnosis, both cardiac (aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation) and extra cardiac (sensory peripheral neuropathy, orthostatic hypotension, carpal tunnel syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis).

ATTR‐CM is relatively rare, with heterogeneous symptoms that could be mistaken for other common diseases. The latest European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines highlighted the cardiac and extracardiac red flags to help suspect CA. Most participants suspected CA in patients with HF symptoms not responding to standard therapy. On cardiac imaging, left‐ventricular hypertrophy and mild reduction in EF raised CA suspicion. Similarly, 75% of physicians participating in the Swiss study believed that left ventricular hypertrophy with normal blood pressure is the main CA indicator. Similar to our study, absolute low‐voltage electrocardiogram (ECG) was the main ECG finding to suspect CA; however, 88% of the Swiss group believed this versus 59% in our group. However, previous literature indicated that absolute low‐QRS voltages are not a common ECG finding, especially in ATTR‐CM and studies have recently focused more on relative low voltage as it is more frequent in ATTR‐CM compared to absolute low ECG voltage.

Although participants had a fair knowledge of CA symptoms and signs, there is room for more ATTR‐CM red flags awareness. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a common misdiagnosis that needs to be ruled out by signs such as asymmetrically increased septal wall thickness and other diagnostic findings using bone scintigraphy, cardiac MRI, and genetic testing. The perceptions of participants widely varied the CA misdiagnosis rate; however, more than half of participants believed there was a high misdiagnosis rate. This could be due to low disease suspicion index, fragmented information about the disease, clinical presentation of CA that could be variable from 1 patient to another, and lack of experience in CA. A previous study observed that the diagnosis of 42% of ATTRwt was delayed for more than 4 years. An Egyptian study discovered that 1 out of 11 patients with undiagnosed cardiomyopathy had CA when undergoing cardiac biopsy. Hence, early and accurate CA diagnosis is critical. Accordingly, noninvasive diagnostic modalities should be recommended in cardiomyopathy and HF of unknown origin.

### Pathophysiology and treatment of cardiac amyloidosis [^f2f6f48f]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Amyloid cardiomyopathy should be suspected in any patient who presents with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction. In patients with echocardiographic evidence of ventricular thickening and without a clear history of hypertension, infiltrative cardiomyopathy should be considered. If imaging suggests the presence of amyloid deposits, confirmation by biopsy is required, although endomyocardial biopsy is generally not necessary. Assessment of aspirated subcutaneous fat and bone-marrow biopsy samples verifies the diagnosis in 40–80% of patients, dependent on the type of amyloidosis. Mass spectroscopy can be used to determine the protein subunit and classify the disease as immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis or transthyretin-related amyloidosis associated with mutant or wild-type TTR (formerly known as familial amyloid cardiomyopathy and senile cardiac amyloidosis, respectively). In this Review, we discuss the characteristics of cardiac amyloidosis, and present a structured approach to both the assessment of patients and treatment with emerging therapies and organ transplantation.

### Electrophysiological manifestations of cardiac amyloidosis: state-of-the-art review [^415fea87]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Amyloid infiltration into the cardiac conduction system causes a plethora of electrophysiological dysfunction, most commonly atrial fibrillation. There is also increasing recognition of other important sequelae, including AV nodal disease and ventricular arrhythmias. The current evidence base for both electrophysiological interventions and the effect of new disease-modifying therapies on CA-related arrhythmias is sparse. However, in light of the ever-growing prominence of CA, these key clinical questions need to be clarified through high-quality collaborative prospective studies.

Overview of cardiac amyloidosis characterizes it as a cardiomyopathy with restrictive physiology from myocardial accumulation of misfolded protein deposits; most cases arise from amyloid immunoglobulin light chain (AL) or amyloid transthyretin (ATTR), with ATTR further subtyped into wild-type (ATTRwt) or hereditary (ATTRv); cardiac involvement in systemic AL amyloidosis is common (up to 75%, depending on diagnostic criteria), and in ATTR it is the dominant clinical feature seen in all cases; AL amyloidosis is rapidly progressive and, if untreated, the median survival is less than 6 months; ATTRv disease follows a varied clinical course with either cardiomyopathy and/or sensory/autonomic polyneuropathy, and ATTR amyloidosis shows age-dependent penetrance with phenotype developing as age advances.

### Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^f87b12a1]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is an underrecognized cause of heart failure (HF). ATTR-CM can lead to a number of cardiovascular manifestations including HF, rhythm disturbances, and valvular disease that ultimately limit quality of life and prognosis. Due to advances in diagnostic modalities and therapeutic options, the prevalence of ATTR-CM is rising. There are several classes of medications under active investigation, though most therapies are most efficacious if instituted early on in the disease course. As such, early clinical recognition and prompt diagnosis are crucial to improving disease related outcomes. In this review, we highlight clinical manifestations of ATTR-CM as well as contemporary diagnostic and treatment approaches to the disease.
