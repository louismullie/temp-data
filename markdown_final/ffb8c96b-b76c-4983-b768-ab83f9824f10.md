## Question

What is the recommended approach to serial troponin measurements for acute coronary syndrome?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended approach to serial troponin measurements in suspected acute coronary syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about initial biomarker selection and assay type. Then, I should define the timing of serial measurements for high-sensitivity versus conventional assays. Next, I will clarify interpretation using rise-and-fall dynamics with 99th percentile thresholds, incorporate sex-specific cutoffs, and detail rapid rule-out strategies. After that, I need to handle inconclusive results and special populations such as chronic kidney disease, and finally integrate findings with ECG and imaging while emphasizing protocol adherence and system-level implementation.

> Let me first confirm the biomarker and assay choice. In suspected ACS, cardiac troponin should be obtained as soon as possible, preferably using a high-sensitivity assay, because hs-cTn enables earlier and more precise detection of myocardial injury and supports accelerated diagnostic pathways, which is endorsed by the 2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP/NAEMSP/SCAI guidelines and consistent with contemporary implementation data in U.S. hospitals [^111N9BzA] [^115V18sP] [^116r86FX].

> Now, I need to specify the serial sampling strategy. Wait, let me verify the exact timings, because I recall a 0/2-hour option, but I should not jump to conclusions before checking guideline language. The ACC/AHA 2025 guideline recommends repeating hs-cTn at 1 to 2 hours after the initial sample if the first result is nondiagnostic, whereas for conventional assays the repeat interval is 3 to 6 hours; the ESC 2023 guideline endorses a 0/1-hour algorithm with a third sample at 3 hours if the first two are inconclusive, so a 0/2-hour routine is not the primary recommendation in ESC and should be reserved for validated local pathways, which corrects my earlier impulse to default to 0/2 hours [^111Rq9hZ] [^116DXVBR] [^114DjxHW] [^1125VYuT].

> I will now examine how to interpret serial results. Diagnosis of myocardial infarction requires a dynamic rise and/or fall in troponin, with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit and a clinical context consistent with ischemia such as symptoms, ischemic ECG changes, or imaging evidence; isolated elevation without dynamics suggests myocardial injury rather than type 1 MI, so I need to ensure I am integrating deltas with the clinical picture to avoid misclassification [^112fpq23] [^113Yc72b].

> Hold on, I should verify thresholds and equity considerations. Sex-specific 99th percentile cutoffs improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce underdiagnosis in women; commonly used hs-cTnI thresholds are around 16 ng/L for women and 34 ng/L for men, nearly doubling MI detection in women with minimal change in men, so I must use assay- and sex-specific URLs embedded in the pathway to avoid bias [^112iGHky] [^113g3wSn].

> Next, I need to check early rule-out options for low-risk patients. A single hs-cTnI concentration below 5 ng/L at presentation has a negative predictive value around 99.4% to 99.6% for 30-day MI or cardiac death, enabling safe discharge when combined with low-risk clinical features and a nonischemic ECG; however, this threshold is assay-specific, validated for certain hs-cTnI platforms, and is less reliable in very early presenters, so I should confirm time from symptom onset and avoid applying this to conventional assays or in high-risk features [^116HRvQ8] [^113jyGg7] [^115yGzi3].

> But wait, what if the first two hs-cTn results are indeterminate without clear dynamics. I should double-check that the ESC 2023 algorithm advises a third sample at 3 hours when 0/1-hour results are inconclusive, and concurrently reassess pretest probability, ECG evolution, and bedside findings while considering structured scores such as HEART, TIMI, or GRACE as adjuncts rather than replacements for clinical judgment [^114DjxHW] [^113Yc72b] [^113tjjQA].

> I need to ensure I consider alternative diagnoses when troponin is elevated without a clear ischemic syndrome. Pulmonary embolism, myocarditis, sepsis, tachyarrhythmias, hypertensive emergencies, heart failure, renal dysfunction, and other non-ACS conditions can raise troponin, and these should prompt targeted evaluation rather than default ACS therapy if the clinical context is discordant, because nonthrombotic elevations retain prognostic significance but require etiology-specific management rather than antithrombotic strategies [^112W1ABT] [^114FirQC] [^1138BnAf].

> Let me consider special populations, especially patients with chronic kidney disease, where baseline troponin elevation is common. In CKD, specificity for ACS is reduced, so I should emphasize the dynamic change from baseline and the clinical context rather than a single absolute value; evidence supports prognostic value of elevated troponin in CKD, but diagnostic thresholds may require larger deltas and careful correlation with symptoms and ECG to avoid overdiagnosis or under-treatment in this high-risk group [^115c98w9] [^115DMcyC] [^1171CvkG].

> I should confirm integration with the full ACS evaluation. ECG remains essential to rapidly detect STEMI and very-high-risk NSTE-ACS features that mandate immediate or early invasive care, while bedside echocardiography can identify new regional wall motion abnormalities to support the diagnosis when biomarkers are equivocal; the diagnostic and initial risk stratification framework must combine symptoms, vitals, ECG, and hs-cTn trends rather than relying on troponin in isolation [^113fb6dS] [^115q1dE4] [^113Yc72b].

> Next, I should review operationalization and quality assurance. Embedding standardized 0/1-hour or 1–2-hour order sets with automated sex-specific URLs, clear delta criteria, and decision support for indeterminate zones improves safety and efficiency; real-world U.S. data show increasing hs-cTn adoption, and adding structured pathways like the high-sensitivity HEART Pathway can reduce unnecessary admissions without compromising 30-day safety outcomes, which argues for system-wide protocolization and clinician education with audit-and-feedback loops [^116r86FX] [^113tjjQA].

> Let me not overlook prognostic granularity. The magnitude of troponin elevation correlates with risks of cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, heart failure, and death in NSTE-ACS, so beyond dichotomous decision-making, the quantitative level and trajectory should inform disposition and intensity of therapy and follow-up, reinforcing that troponin is both diagnostic and prognostic when interpreted correctly over time [^114gX7pT].

Trend troponin in ACS by obtaining a **baseline high-sensitivity troponin at presentation** [^111N9BzA] and repeating at 1–2 hours for hs-cTn or 3–6 hours for conventional assays [^111Rq9hZ], using the **99th percentile as the diagnostic threshold**. A **dynamic rise/fall** with at least one value above the 99th percentile supports MI [^113Yc72b], while a **stable or minimal change** suggests non-ACS causes [^112W1ABT]. If results are inconclusive, repeat at 3 hours [^114DjxHW]; persistently elevated or rising troponin indicates ongoing injury and higher risk [^114gX7pT], guiding escalation of care [^112LLxUX].

---

## Initial troponin measurement

Obtain a **baseline high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) level immediately upon patient presentation** [^111N9BzA]. Prioritize **hs-cTn assays** for their superior sensitivity and earlier detection of myocardial injury [^113Yc72b] [^116HRvQ8].

---

## Serial troponin measurements

- **High-sensitivity assays**: Repeat hs-cTn measurements at 1–2 hours [^111Rq9hZ] after the initial sample.

- **Conventional assays**: If only conventional assays are available, repeat measurements at 3–6 hours [^116DXVBR] after the initial sample.

- **Inconclusive results**: If initial measurements are inconclusive [^114DjxHW], obtain additional testing at 3 hours [^1125VYuT].

---

## Interpretation of troponin trends

- **Diagnostic threshold**: Use the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) [^113Yc72b] as the diagnostic threshold for myocardial infarction (MI) [^113g3wSn].

- **Dynamic change**: A significant rise or fall in troponin levels [^113Yc72b], with at least one value above the 99th percentile, supports the diagnosis of MI [^112fpq23].

- **Stable elevations**: Persistent, stable elevations [^113Yc72b] without significant change typically indicate chronic myocardial injury [^115DfoBh] rather than acute MI.

---

## Clinical decision-making based on troponin trends

- **Rising troponin**: Indicates ongoing myocardial injury [^111Rq9hZ], necessitating urgent evaluation and potential invasive management [^112LLxUX].

- **Falling troponin**: Suggests resolving injury but still requires careful monitoring and risk assessment [^113Yc72b].

- **Stable elevated troponin**: Often indicates chronic myocardial injury [^1119qax1], requiring further evaluation for underlying chronic conditions.

---

## Prognostic implications of troponin trends

Patients with rising or persistently elevated troponin levels have increased risks of adverse outcomes, including mortality, heart failure, and recurrent MI [^114gX7pT]. Troponin trends support **risk stratification**, helping identify high-risk patients who may benefit from more aggressive therapeutic interventions [^1161gimw].

---

## Special considerations

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) [^115c98w9] often has chronically elevated troponin levels, so interpretation should **focus on dynamic changes** rather than absolute values [^115DMcyC]. Non-ACS conditions can also cause troponin elevations (e.g. myocarditis, pulmonary embolism) [^112W1ABT], making **clinical context essential** for accurate interpretation [^1138BnAf].

## Summary table: troponin trending protocol for ACS

| **Step** | **Action** | **Timing** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Baseline hs-cTn measurement | Immediately upon presentation [^111N9BzA] | Establish initial troponin level |
| 2 | Repeat hs-cTn measurement | 1–2 hours after initial sample [^111Rq9hZ] | Detect rise or fall in troponin |
| 3 | Additional testing if inconclusive | 3 hours after initial sample [^114DjxHW] | Clarify diagnosis |

The objective of this study was to determine if the extent of quantitative troponin elevation predicted mortality as well as in-hospital complications such as cardiac arrest, new heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.

- **Design**: 16,318 patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACS) from the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) were included. The maximum 24-hour troponin value, measured as a multiple of the local laboratory upper limit of normal, was used. The population was divided into five groups based on the degree of troponin elevation, and outcomes were compared. An adjusted analysis was performed using quantitative troponin as a continuous variable with adjustment for known prognostic variables.

- **Results**: For each approximate 10-fold increase in the troponin ratio, there was an associated increase in cardiac arrest, sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) (1.0, 2.4, 3.4, 5.9, and 13.4%; p < 0.001 for linear trend), cardiogenic shock (0.5, 1.4, 2.0, 4.4, and 12.7%; p < 0.001), new heart failure (2.5, 5.1, 7.4, 11.6, and 15.8%; p < 0.001), and mortality (0.8, 2.2, 3.0, 5.3, and 14.0%; p < 0.001). These findings were replicated using the troponin ratio as a continuous variable and adjusting for covariates (cardiac arrest, sustained VT or VF, OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.39 to 1.74; cardiogenic shock, OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.61 to 2.18; and new heart failure, OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.45 to 1.71). The degree of troponin elevation was predictive of early mortality (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.44 to 1.81; p < 0.001 for days 0–14) and longer-term mortality (HR 1.1).

### Do patients with acute coronary syndrome face higher mortality on weekends versus weekdays? A comprehensive analysis of demographic, geographic, and temporal trends in the United States [^116pooSs]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) — encompassing ST-elevation and non–ST-elevation myocardial infarctions (MI) and unstable angina — remains a major public health burden in the United States. Each year, roughly 1.2 million Americans are hospitalized with ACS. Despite decades of guideline-driven therapy, ACS continues to exact enormous clinical and economic tolls; the 2024 American Heart Association (AHA) update estimates direct and indirect annual costs at nearly $400 billion.

Care delivery for ACS has improved markedly with high-sensitivity troponin testing, regional primary-PCI networks, and evidence-based pharmacotherapy, yet inequality in outcomes persists. Women receive reperfusion less often and show higher adjusted mortality than men. Black and Hispanic patients have 35%–45% lower odds of revascularization and worse survival after MI, even in contemporary practice. Rural hospitals likewise report higher mortality, longer treatment delays, and lower use of invasive procedures than urban centers. These disparities reveal that advances in technology and guidelines do not automatically translate into equitable, round-the-clock care.

Another system-level issue gaining fresh attention is the "weekend effect" — the tendency for patients admitted or who pass away on weekends, particularly Saturdays and Sundays, to experience poorer outcomes. Earlier registry studies have found that people admitted with ACS on weekends faced higher in-hospital mortality rates and longer delays in treatment, such as extended door-to-balloon times. Potential causes include reduced weekend staffing and resource availability.

### Implementation of a sensitive troponin I assay and risk of recurrent myocardial infarction and death in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome [^111cqPqe]. JAMA (2011). Low credibility.

Although troponin assays have become increasingly more sensitive, it is unclear whether further reductions in the threshold of detection for plasma troponin concentrations will improve clinical outcomes in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

- **Objective**: To determine whether lowering the diagnostic threshold for myocardial infarction (MI) with a sensitive troponin assay could improve clinical outcomes.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: All consecutive patients admitted with suspected ACS to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, before (n = 1038; February 1-July 31, 2008, during the validation phase) and after (n = 1054; February 1-July 31, 2009, during the implementation phase) lowering the threshold of detection for myocardial necrosis from 0.20 to 0.05 ng/mL with a sensitive troponin I assay were stratified into 3 groups (< 0.05 ng/mL, 0.05–0.19 ng/mL, and ≥ 0.20 ng/mL). During the validation phase, only concentrations above the original diagnostic threshold of 0.20 ng/mL were reported to clinicians.

- **Main outcome measure**: Event-free survival (reMI and death) at 1 year in patients grouped by plasma troponin concentrations.

- **Results**: Plasma troponin concentrations were less than 0.05 ng/mL in 1340 patients (64%), 0.05 to 0.19 ng/mL in 170 patients (8%), and 0.20 ng/mL or more in 582 patients (28%). During the validation phase, 39% of patients with plasma troponin concentrations of 0.05 to 0.19 ng/mL were dead or had reMI at 1 year compared with 7% and 24% of those patients with troponin concentrations of less than 0.05 ng/mL and 0.20 ng/mL or more, respectively.

### High sensitivity cardiac troponin and the under-diagnosis of myocardial infarction in women: Prospective cohort study [^112iGHky]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

To evaluate the diagnosis of myocardial infarction using a high sensitivity troponin I assay and sex-specific diagnostic thresholds in men and women with suspected acute coronary syndrome, a prospective cohort study was conducted at a regional cardiac centre in the United Kingdom.

Consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome were enrolled (n = 1126, 46% women). Two cardiologists independently adjudicated the diagnosis of myocardial infarction using a high sensitivity troponin I assay with sex-specific diagnostic thresholds (men 34 ng/L, women 16 ng/L). This approach was compared with the practice where a contemporary assay (50 ng/L, single threshold) was used to guide care.

- **Main outcome measure**: Diagnosis of myocardial infarction.

The high sensitivity troponin I assay noticeably increased the diagnosis of myocardial infarction in women (from 11% to 22%; P < 0.001) but had a minimal effect in men (from 19% to 21%, P = 0.002). Women were less likely than men to be referred to a cardiologist or undergo coronary revascularization (P < 0.05 for both). At 12 months, women with undisclosed increases in troponin concentration (17–49 ng/L) and those with myocardial infarction (≥ 50 ng/L) had the highest rate of death or reinfarction compared with women without (≤ 16 ng/L) myocardial infarction (25%, 24%, and 4%, respectively; P < 0.001).

In conclusion, although having little effect in men, a high sensitivity troponin assay with sex-specific diagnostic thresholds may double the diagnosis of myocardial infarction in women and identify those at high risk of reinfarction and death.

### Implementation of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays in the United States [^116r86FX]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Few data exist regarding the implementation of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays in the United States since their approval.

- **Objectives**: This study sought to explore trends in hs-cTn assay implementation over time and assess the association of their use with in-hospital cardiac testing and outcomes.

- **Methods**: The study examined trends in implementation of hs-cTn assays among participating hospitals in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry Chest Pain-MI [Myocardial Infarction] Registry from January 1, 2019, through September 30, 2021. Associations among hs-cTn use, use of in-hospital diagnostic imaging, and patient outcomes were assessed using generalized estimating equation models with logistic or gamma distributions.

- **Results**: Among 550 participating hospitals (N = 251,000), implementation of hs-cTn assays increased from 3.3% in the first quarter of 2019 to 32.6% in the third quarter of 2021 (P trend < 0.001). Use of hs-cTn was associated with more echocardiography among persons with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS; 82.4% vs 75.0%; adjusted odds ratio: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.19–1.73) but not among low-risk chest pain individuals. Use of hs-cTn was associated with less invasive coronary angiography among low-risk patients (3.7% vs 4.5%; adjusted odds ratio: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.58–0.92) but similar use for patients with NSTE-ACS. There was no association between hs-cTn use and noninvasive stress testing or coronary computed tomography angiography testing. Among individuals with NSTE-ACS, hs-cTn use was not associated with revasc…

### Resource utilization and outcome among patients with selective versus nonselective troponin testing [^116qnQdb]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

In patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS), troponin testing is effective for diagnosis and prognosis. However, its use has expanded to include patients without suspected ACS. This nonselective troponin testing has unknown consequences for resource utilization and outcomes. Therefore, we examined selective versus nonselective troponin testing with respect to patient characteristics, resource utilization, and outcomes.

- **Methods**: This retrospective 1-year study included all patients with troponin testing at a U.S. emergency department. Testing was classified as selective (ACS) or nonselective (non-ACS) based on admission ICD-9 codes. The troponin upper reference limit (URL) was set at the ≥ 99th percentile.

- **Results**: Among 47,053 patients, troponin was measured in 9109 (19%), of whom 5764 were hospitalized. The admission diagnosis was non-ACS in 4427 (77%) and ACS in 1337 (23%). Non-ACS patients were older, aged 71 ± 17 years compared to 65 ± 16 years for ACS patients, with a longer hospital stay of 77 hours versus 32 hours, and greater 1-year mortality at 22% versus 6.7%. More than 80% of the non-ACS population experienced contemporary troponin testing, which is frequently nonselective. The non-ACS and ACS populations differ significantly regarding clinical characteristics, revascularization rates, and outcomes.

### The meaning of elevated troponin I levels: Not always acute coronary syndromes [^114FirQC]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Troponin elevation can be caused by etiologies other than acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Our hypothesis was that elevated troponins occur more frequently in non-ACS cases, but ACS cases (type 1 ST-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] and type 1 non-STEMI [NSTEMI]) have significantly higher troponin elevations.

- **Methods**: This was a cross-sectional cohort analysis of a random subset of all patients with elevated troponins (defined as ≥ 0.06 ng/mL) over a 1-year period from July 2013 to June 2014. The first positive troponin I and the peak were used in this study. All included patients had medical record reviews to determine whether our cardiologists or hospitalists attributed the elevated troponin to an ACS (NSTEMI or STEMI) or non-ACS cause. Non-ACS causes were categorized as infection, cancer, renal diseases, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, trauma, cardiac arrest, neurologic disease, hypertension, or other. Data were extracted by two investigators on the cause of the elevated troponin. Three sessions to educate data extractors were arranged, and methods of data extraction were discussed. A 5% sample was reevaluated by the other extractor to determine interrater agreement measures.

- **Data analysis**: Parametric data were evaluated using t-tests and analysis of variance. Dichotomous variables were compared using the χ² test. Troponin data were evaluated using nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whitney U tests. A logistic regression model was created with variables selected a priori to evaluate the predictive ability of these variables in differentiating ACS vs. non-ACS causes.

The analysis focused on determining the interrater reliability and the evaluation of various causes for elevated troponin levels, aiming to better differentiate between ACS and non-ACS causes.

### Cardiac troponin at the point of care in acute and chronic coronary syndromes [^112fpq23]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes encompass a spectrum of conditions, including ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and unstable angina. These presentations have a common underlying pathophysiology, with the majority due to coronary atherosclerotic plaque rupture with thrombosis resulting in myocardial ischemia. The mortality of acute coronary syndromes is highest within hours of symptom onset, and the prompt diagnosis can allow timely delivery of life-saving treatments that improve prognosis. The electrocardiogram is essential for differentiating STEMI from NSTEMI, while measuring cardiac troponin is required to rule in or out myocardial infarction in those without ST-segment elevation and to differentiate NSTEMI from unstable angina. For a diagnosis of myocardial infarction, a rise and/or fall of cardiac troponin is required, with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL), in addition to one of the following: symptoms of myocardial ischemia, new ischemic changes on the electrocardiogram, the development of pathological Q-waves, imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality, or identification of atherothrombosis on coronary angiography.

The term "chronic coronary syndrome" is more recent and encompasses a range of clinical presentations due to diseases of the coronary arteries and/or microcirculation resulting in structural or functional abnormalities that lead to transient myocardial ischemia.

### Temporal evolution of serum concentrations of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin during 1 year after acute coronary syndrome admission [^112U5N2x]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, studies on the biological variation of cardiac troponins, measured with contemporary high-sensitivity assays, are scarce, and their sample sizes have usually been small. Particularly in patients with established chronic coronary syndrome (CCS), such as patients following acute coronary syndrome (ACS), little to no information is available. The parameters of variation found in our study are comparable to earlier reports in subjects sampled from the general "healthy" population. For example, Wu et al. reported a long-term individual variation of 14% for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) based on 17 healthy subjects. The coefficient of interindividual or between-subject variation in their report was lower than in our study, which suggests that cardiac troponins show larger variations in patients with CCS than in healthy individuals. This larger between-subject variation in a diseased population compared to a healthy one is also confirmed by a study of Meijers et al, which compared biological variation in 83 patients with heart failure to 28 healthy subjects. They reported a coefficient of interindividual or between-subject variation for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) of 96.6% and 51.2%, respectively. The coefficients of variation (CVs), however, were similar in both populations and comparable to our cohort.

### Patient selection for high sensitivity cardiac troponin testing and diagnosis of myocardial infarction: Prospective cohort study [^114gBg92]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Our study has some limitations that merit discussion. Firstly, we did not perform serial cardiac troponin testing or systematically conduct coronary investigations in our population of unselected patients. As a result, we may have underestimated the prevalence of type 1 myocardial infarction. Despite our careful attempt to classify patients, we accept that some patients may have been misclassified. Reassuringly, the relation between the prevalence of myocardial infarction and the positive predictive value was consistent in our US population, where all patients had up to four serial high sensitivity cardiac troponin tests. This consistency suggests that the lack of serial testing in our unselected patients has not compromised our analysis. In our practice, we advocate for serial testing in all patients with myocardial injury to clarify the mechanism of injury and document whether a rise and/or fall in cardiac troponin levels has occurred to support the diagnosis of myocardial infarction.

Secondly, we acknowledge that although most troponin tests in the emergency department are intended to evaluate patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, guidelines recommend testing for cardiac biomarkers in other acute presentations, including pulmonary embolus and acute heart failure. Although we have shown how high sensitivity cardiac troponin testing without consideration of pre-test probability affects the positive predictive value for type 1 myocardial infarction, we accept that cardiac troponin testing is not used exclusively to evaluate patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome.

### Temporal evolution of serum concentrations of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin during 1 year after acute coronary syndrome admission [^111e9CPg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

We were able to demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining patient‐specific reference values in patients with established chronic coronary syndrome (CCS). This reference value could be retrieved in the majority of our patients following acute coronary syndrome (ACS) based on a limited number of consecutive measurements, whereas these values showed good agreement with samples taken later during follow‐up. It is our opinion that the patient‐specific reference value can help fine‐tune the diagnostic process in specific situations.

These reference values could be useful in fine‐tuning a personalized approach in patients following ACS, particularly in those with asymptomatic elevations detected incidentally (e.g. high-sensitivity cardiac troponin [hs‐cTn] measurements in the perioperative setting) and in those presenting with unclear symptoms. For instance, if a patient presents with atypical complaints and has slightly elevated hs‐cTn concentrations in two consecutive measurements, comparing these concentrations with the patient‐specific reference could help determine if the patient is more likely to have an ACS and needs to go to the catheterization laboratory or can be sent home.

Atypical presentations are not uncommon, and a rise in hs‐cTn concentrations cannot always be identified, particularly if patients present several hours after symptoms start when cardiac troponin levels might already be in the plateau phase. Additionally, when a patient has typical complaints but the hs‐cTn concentrations are still below the population upper reference limit (URL) with a borderline rise between two consecutive measurements, comparing the concentration with their individual reference value could be informative.

### Convalescent troponin and cardiovascular death following acute coronary syndrome [^115XsBQ2]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing is used in the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes; however, its role during convalescence is unknown. We investigated the long-term prognostic significance of serial convalescent high-sensitivity cardiac troponin concentrations following acute coronary syndrome.

In a prospective multicenter observational cohort study of 2,140 patients with acute coronary syndrome, cardiac troponin I concentrations were measured in 1,776 patients at 4 and 12 months following the index event. Patients were stratified into three groups according to the troponin concentration at 4 months using the 99th centile (women > 16 ng/L, men > 34 ng/L) and the median concentration of those within the reference range. The primary outcome was cardiovascular death.

Troponin concentrations at 4 months were measurable in 99.0% (1,759/1,776) of patients (average age 67 ± 12 years, 72% male) and were ≤ 5 ng/L (median) and > 99th centile in 44.8% (795) and 9.3% (166) of patients, respectively. There were 202 (11.4%) cardiovascular deaths following a median of 4.8 years. After adjusting for the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events score, troponin remained an independent predictor of cardiovascular death (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 1.5 per doubling) with the highest risk observed in those with increasing concentrations at 12 months. Patients with 4-month troponin concentrations > 99th centile were at increased risk of cardiovascular death compared with those ≤ 5 ng/L (29.5% (49/166) vs 4.3% (34/795); adjusted HR 4.9, 95% CI 3.8 to 23.7).

Convalescent cardiac troponin concentration is a significant prognostic marker in patients following an acute coronary syndrome.

### Efficacy of myocardial contrast echocardiography in the diagnosis and risk stratification of acute coronary syndrome [^115q1dE4]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). High credibility.

We examined the hypothesis that myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) is superior to conventional electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and troponin I criteria for diagnosing acute coronary syndrome. We prospectively enrolled 114 consecutive patients (60 ± 10 years of age, 73 men) who presented to the emergency room with chest pain on exertion and at rest. **Exclusion criteria**: included patients under 40 years of age, those with the presence of a Q wave or ST-segment elevation, and those with a poor echocardiographic window.

Echocardiography and MCE were performed to assess regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMAs) and myocardial perfusion defects using continuous infusion of perfluorocarbon-exposed sonicated dextrose albumin. Acute coronary syndrome was confirmed in 87 patients. There were no deaths; 46 patients had acute myocardial infarction, and 41 patients required urgent revascularization. **Multiple logistic regression analysis**: revealed that myocardial perfusion defect (odds ratio 87, p < 0.001) was the only independent variable for diagnosing acute coronary syndrome.

- **Independent predictors for acute myocardial infarction**: included myocardial perfusion defect (odds ratio 21, p = 0.001) and troponin I levels (odds ratio 3, p = 0.009). The sensitivity of myocardial perfusion defect for diagnosing acute coronary syndrome was 77%, significantly higher than the sensitivities of ST change, troponin I increase, and RWMA (28%, 34%, and 49%, respectively), with similar specificities ranging from 85% to 96%. In conclusion, MCE is more sensitive than the currently used electrocardiographic and troponin I criteria.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, specifically with respect to diagnosis, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend basing the diagnosis and initial short-term risk stratification of ACS on a combination of clinical history, symptoms, vital signs, other physical findings, ECG, and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin.

### Temporal changes of stable high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T levels and prognosis [^115DfoBh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

In a large cohort of patients presenting with cardiac symptoms in the emergency department but without acute coronary syndrome as a final diagnosis, we found that temporal increases of previously stable high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) concentrations are associated with increases in the risk of death and cardiovascular events. The highest risks were observed in patients with myocardial injury and persistently stable or increasing hs-cTnT, in whom there was an especially pronounced risk of heart failure hospitalization. Novel management strategies for patients with stable hs-cTn concentrations are needed to improve prognosis.

### High-sensitivity troponin in the evaluation of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome: a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised controlled trial [^116meb5x]. Lancet (2018). High credibility.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays permit the use of lower thresholds for diagnosing myocardial infarction; however, whether this improves clinical outcomes is unknown. We aimed to determine whether the introduction of a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) assay with a sex-specific 99th centile diagnostic threshold would reduce subsequent myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome.

In this stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised controlled trial across ten secondary or tertiary care hospitals in Scotland, we evaluated the implementation of an hs-cTnI assay in consecutive patients who had been admitted to the hospitals' emergency departments with suspected acute coronary syndrome. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they presented with suspected acute coronary syndrome and had paired cardiac troponin measurements from the standard care and trial assays. During a validation phase of 6–12 months, results from the hs-cTnI assay were concealed from the attending clinician, and a contemporary cardiac troponin I (cTnI) assay was used to guide care. Hospitals were randomly allocated to early (n = 5 hospitals) or late (n = 5 hospitals) implementation, in which the high-sensitivity assay and sex-specific 99th centile diagnostic threshold were introduced immediately after the 6-month validation phase or deferred for a further 6 months. Patients reclassified by the high-sensitivity assay were defined as those with an increased hs-cTnI concentration in whom cTnI concentrations were below the detection limit.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I at presentation in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome: A cohort study [^116HRvQ8]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

- **Summary**: Suspected acute coronary syndrome is the most common reason for emergency admission to hospitals, placing a significant burden on healthcare resources. Developing strategies to identify low-risk patients suitable for immediate discharge could yield substantial benefits.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective cohort study involving 6,304 consecutively enrolled patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, presenting at four secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Scotland. Plasma troponin concentrations were measured at presentation using a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay. Through derivation and validation cohorts, we evaluated the negative predictive value of various troponin concentrations for the primary outcome of either index myocardial infarction, subsequent myocardial infarction, or cardiac death within 30 days.

- **Findings**: In the derivation cohort, 782 (16%) of 4,870 patients experienced index myocardial infarction, while an additional 32 (1%) re-presented with myocardial infarction and 75 (2%) suffered cardiac deaths within 30 days. Among patients without myocardial infarction at presentation, troponin concentrations were below 5 ng/L in 2,311 (61%) of 3,799 patients, showing a negative predictive value of 99.6% (95% CI 99.3–99.8) for the primary outcome. This negative predictive value remained consistent across groups stratified by age, sex, risk factors, and previous cardiovascular disease. In two independent validation cohorts, troponin concentrations were less than 5 ng/L in 594 (56%) of 1,061 patients, with an overall negative predictive value of 99.4% (98.8–99.9).

### Acute coronary syndrome: biochemical strategies in the troponin era [^116y28cc]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

New biomarkers, such as cardiac troponins, have a major role to play in the cost-effective management of individuals with acute chest pain and suspected coronary syndrome. The laboratory is now poised to assume a vital role in assessing damage and determining prognosis. The redefined biochemical criterion proposed to classify acute coronary syndrome patients presenting with ischemic symptoms as patients with myocardial infarction is heavily predicated on an increased troponin concentration in the blood. In an era of evidence-based medicine, we can no longer overlook the diagnostic and prognostic benefits provided by the measurement of these highly sensitive and specific proteins.

### Safety and effectiveness of the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin HEART pathway in patients with possible acute coronary syndrome [^113tjjQA]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2024). High credibility.

The HEART Pathway (History, Electrocardiogram, Age, Risk factors, Troponin) can be used with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin to risk stratify emergency department patients with possible acute coronary syndrome. However, data on whether a high-sensitivity HEART Pathway (hs-HP) is safe and effective is lacking.

- **Methods**: An interrupted time series study was conducted at five North Carolina sites, involving 26,126 adult emergency department patients being investigated for possible acute coronary syndrome and without ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Patients were accrued into 16-month preimplementation and postimplementation cohorts with a 6-month wash-in phase. During the preimplementation phase (January 2019 to April 2020), the traditional HEART Pathway was used with 0- and 3-hour contemporary troponin measures (Siemens). In the postimplementation period (November 2020 to February 2022), a modified hs-HP was used with 0- and 2-hour high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (Beckman Coulter) measures. The primary safety and effectiveness outcomes were 30-day all-cause death or myocardial infarction and 30-day hospitalizations. These outcomes, along with the early discharge rate (emergency department discharge without stress testing or coronary angiography), were determined from health records and death index data. Outcomes were compared preimplementation versus postimplementation using χ² tests and multivariable logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders.

- **Results**: Preimplementation and postimplementation cohorts included 12,317 and 13,809 patients, respectively, of whom 52.7% were analyzed.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for coronary artery disease, specifically concerning cardiac troponin, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend immediate referral to the emergency department and/or obtaining repeated measurements of blood troponin. Preferably, high-sensitivity or ultrasensitive assays should be used to rule out acute myocardial injury if clinical or ECG assessments suggest acute coronary syndrome rather than chronic coronary syndrome.

### Ischaemia modified albumin in the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes [^115pXU7F]. Resuscitation (2009). Low credibility.

The early diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome remains problematic, despite recent improvements. Traditionally, the diagnosis of acute cardiac ischaemia relies on the combination of chest pain, electrocardiographic changes, and elevation of serum markers. Troponins are currently the "gold standard" test for the detection of myocardial necrosis, but they are unsuitable for early diagnosis, as nearly 50% of patients may present to the emergency department with non-diagnostic concentrations. Ischaemia modified albumin increases within minutes after the onset of ischaemia, remains elevated for 6 to 12 hours, and returns to normal within 24 hours. Thus, it may be a valuable aid for the clinician, enabling early detection of ischaemia before the development of myocardial necrosis. Its high sensitivity comes at the expense of lower specificity because its increase may be due to ischaemia of other tissues such as gastrointestinal or skeletal muscle tissues. This paper focuses on the cardiology aspect of this biomarker, underlying its potential value in the emergency department.

### Temporal changes of stable high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T levels and prognosis [^1119qax1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Use of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays in clinical practice has improved the detection of myocardial injury in patients who present in the emergency department (ED). Stable elevated hs-cTn concentrations, in the absence of other acute medical conditions such as acute coronary syndrome, may be indicative of ongoing chronic myocardial injury. This condition is associated with a high risk of death, cardiovascular events, long hospital stays, and a high rate of readmissions. Persistently elevated hs-cTn concentrations are related to the risk of future cardiovascular events and death in individuals with and without prior cardiovascular disease, with the highest risks observed among individuals with the most pronounced hs-cTn increases. However, the clinical implications of temporal changes in previously stable high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) concentrations are unknown.

Using a large observational cohort of patients seeking ED care, who presented with stable hs-cTnT concentrations, we sought to investigate the risk of death and cardiovascular outcomes associated with temporal changes in previously stable hs-cTnT concentrations. Additionally, we aimed to explore predictors of persistently stable hs-cTnT concentrations without a dynamic pattern over time.

### Implications of lowering threshold of plasma troponin concentration in diagnosis of myocardial infarction: Cohort study [^1149FRBm]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Objective: To assess the relation between troponin concentration, assay precision, and clinical outcomes in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome.

Design: Cohort study.

Setting: Tertiary center in Scotland.

Participants: 2092 consecutive patients admitted with suspected acute coronary syndrome were stratified with a sensitive troponin I assay into three groups (< 0.012, 0.012–0.049, and ≥ 0.050 µg/L) based on the 99th percentile for troponin concentration (0.012 µg/L; coefficient of variation 20.8%) and the diagnostic threshold (0.050 µg/L; 7.2%).

Main outcome measure: One-year survival without events such as remyocardial infarction or death in patients grouped by troponin concentration.

Results: Troponin I concentrations were < 0.012 µg/L in 988 patients (47%), 0.012–0.049 µg/L in 352 patients (17%), and ≥ 0.050 µg/L in 752 patients (36%). Adoption of the 99th percentile would increase the number of people receiving a diagnosis of myocardial infarction from 752 to 1104, a relative increase of 47%. At one year, patients with troponin concentrations of 0.012–0.049 µg/L were more likely to be dead or readmitted with remyocardial infarction than those with troponin concentrations < 0.012 µg/L (13% v 3%, P < 0.001; odds ratio 4.7, 95% confidence interval 2.9 to 7.9). Compared with troponin ≥ 0.050 µg/L, patients with troponin 0.012–0.049 µg/L had a higher risk profile but were less likely to have a diagnosis of, or be investigated and treated for, acute coronary syndrome.

Conclusion: Lowering the diagnostic threshold to the 99th percentile and accepting greater assay imprecision…

### A new definition for myocardial infarction: What difference does it make [^1164Bkdr]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

As a response to changing diagnostic tools of myocardial infarction (MI), new case definitions for acute coronary events were published in 2003 as the American Heart Association Scientific Statement. We assessed the new definition in hospitalized patients in a large population-based MI register study.

- **Methods and results**: We identified all suspected acute coronary syndromes with data either on troponin T or on troponin I and at least one of the enzymatic markers of myocardial injury (n = 6104). The 2003 definition with the use of troponins identified 83% more definite MIs than the WHO MONICA definition using cardiac enzymes. The additional patients were older, had more often diabetes, and received less often thrombolysis and revascularization than those having MI by both definitions. Adjusting for age, sex, study area, and study year, the additional patients with their first MI aged 25–74 had a higher risk of cardiovascular death within 1 year than patients having definite MI by both definitions (hazard ratio 1.6, 95% CI 1.1–2.2).

- **Conclusion**: The changing diagnostic criteria present a considerable challenge for the assessment of long-term trends in MI events in the community as well as for longitudinal studies of the natural history of MI. The 2003 definition, when applied using troponins, identified a sizable new group of MI patients, among persons with suspected acute coronary syndrome, at high risk of an event.

### Prevalence, determinants, and clinical associations of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin in patients attending emergency departments [^115sdYVj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Although cardiac troponin is integral to the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, the approach to testing varies markedly across different healthcare systems. In some centers, cardiac troponin is used as a screening test, irrespective of the clinical presentation. In a representative sample of patients attending emergency departments in the United States, cardiac troponin was measured in 1 in 5 patients. Moreover, in more than half of those who were subsequently hospitalized, one-third of patients did not have any cardiac symptoms.

We recently assessed the variation in patient selection for high-sensitivity troponin testing between emergency departments and its impact on the diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction. Compared to the United Kingdom, cardiac troponin testing was performed more widely in the United States, resulting in a much lower prevalence (4.2% vs 14.5%) and positive predictive value (16.4% vs 59.7%) for type 1 myocardial infarction in those patients tested. These findings highlight the importance of patient selection to optimize the diagnostic utility of cardiac troponin testing for type 1 myocardial infarction.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays have been widely implemented in many countries and have improved the diagnosis of myocardial infarction and risk stratification in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome. However, the high-sensitivity test also increases the detection of elevated cardiac troponin in many cardiac and noncardiac conditions that are unrelated to acute coronary syndrome.

### Convalescent troponin and cardiovascular death following acute coronary syndrome [^1161gimw]. Heart (2019). High credibility.

Our findings have clear potential to improve follow-up and management of patients discharged following acute coronary syndrome. We have shown that a single measurement of cardiac troponin during convalescence from an acute coronary syndrome can identify nearly half of patients as low-risk, with a 0.5% annual incidence of cardiovascular death. Furthermore, 1 in 10 patients have persistent myocardial injury and are identified as very high risk, with annual event rates approaching 10%, for whom careful assessment and more intensive treatment may be warranted. For those at intermediate risk, repeated measurement of cardiac troponin concentrations at 12 months can be used to improve risk estimation and enable prognostic reclassification into either low-risk or high-risk groups.

Convalescent troponin concentrations are not simply a surrogate for the extent of myocardial injury sustained during the index coronary event, as evidenced by the weak correlation between peak troponin during the index hospitalization and the 4-month troponin level. Nor are they merely a reflection of left ventricular function. Instead, they provide greater prognostic information than either of these traditional risk indicators and are additive to all other clinical, biochemical, and echocardiographic risk factors that might typically be available to clinicians when making treatment decisions. Furthermore, within this real-world observational study, we have revealed a substantial treatment gap whereby less than half of patients with troponin concentrations > 99th percentile received appropriate care.

### Temporal evolution of serum concentrations of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin during 1 year after acute coronary syndrome admission [^113kurQx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

Study patients:

For the BIOMArCS main results analysis, a case-cohort approach was applied, including a total of 187 patients, of whom 45 reached the study endpoint of cardiovascular death or repeat ACS. For the analysis, these endpoint cases were excluded, and the set was enriched with 49 patients who had daily sampling during the first 4 days after the index ACS. Hence, the analysis set consisted of 191 endpoint-free patients. These patients contributed a median of 8 (25th–75th percentile; range, 5–10) repeated serum samples per patient (altogether 1507 samples), in which hs-cTnI (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL) and hs-cTnT (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) were determined in a blinded fashion and in one batch. These assays have a lower limit of detection and population upper reference limit (URL; 99th percentile of the distribution in the general population) of 1.2 and 26.6 ng/L for hs-cTnI, and 5 and 14 ng/L for hs-cTnT, respectively. The limit of blank was equal to the lower limit of detection for hs-cTnI and 3.0 ng/L for hs-cTnT. Undetectable concentrations were assigned the concentration of 1.0 ng/L for hs-cTnI and 2.9 ng/L for hs-cTnT.

- **Statistical analysis**: Continuous variables are presented as mean (SD) or median (25th–75th percentile), depending on their distributions. Categorical variables are summarized as numbers and percentages. Differences between hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT were investigated using McNemar's test for paired nominal data or a Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired continuous data.

### Temporal evolution of serum concentrations of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin during 1 year after acute coronary syndrome admission [^11762ckz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Detailed insights into the temporal evolution of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin following acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are currently lacking. This study aimed to describe and compare the post-ACS kinetics of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), and to determine their intra- and interindividual variation in clinically stable patients.

Methods and Results: We determined hs-cTnI (Abbott) and hs-cTnT (Roche) in 1507 repeated blood samples derived from 191 patients with ACS (median, 8 samples per patient) who remained free from adverse cardiac events during 1-year follow-up. Post-ACS kinetics were studied using linear mixed-effect models. Patients providing samples during the 6- to 12-month post-ACS time frame were considered to have chronic coronary syndrome. We assessed the average hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT concentrations and their intra- and interindividual variations. Compared to hs-cTnT, hs-cTnI peaked higher (median 3506 ng/L versus 494 ng/L; P < 0.001) and fell below the biomarker-specific upper reference limit more quickly (16 versus 19 days; P < 0.001). In post-6-month samples, hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT showed a modest correlation (r Spearman = 0.60), whereas the average hs-cTnT concentration was five times more likely to be above the upper reference limit than hs-cTnI. The intraindividual variations of hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT were 14.0% and 18.1%, respectively, while the interindividual variations were 94.1% and 75.9%, respectively.

Conclusions: Hs-cTnI peaked higher after ACS and reduced below the upper reference limit more quickly than hs-cTnT.

### The prognostic value of high sensitivity troponin T 7 weeks after an acute coronary syndrome [^111p2pKN]. Heart (2012). High credibility.

Kaplan–Meier curves illustrate the cumulative incidence of death or acute myocardial infarction (AMI) over a median follow-up of 30 months, stratified by the trends in high sensitivity (hs) troponin T. Each group is defined by the hs troponin T levels at admission and at a 7-week follow-up, with statistical significance determined by the Log-rank test (p < 0.001). HST, high sensitivity troponin T; LVSD, left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

We conducted multivariate analyses, revealing that the 7-week hs-TnT level is a significant and independent predictor of long-term outcomes in post-acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. This finding aligns with previous studies where troponin samples were collected either during acute ACS events or in chronic stable patients. A novel finding in our study is the superior prognostic power of hs-TnT compared to BNP, as demonstrated by both univariate and multivariate analyses. While BNP's role as a prognostic marker in ACS is well-established through previous trials, our research indicates that while serial measures of BNP predict prognosis after ACS independently, hs-TnT demonstrates even greater predictive accuracy than BNP.

### Multi-marker strategy of natriuretic peptide with either conventional or high-sensitivity troponin-T for acute coronary syndrome diagnosis in emergency department patients with chest pain: From the "Rule Out Myocardial Infarction using Computer Assisted Tomography" (ROMICAT) trial [^112JvLiQ]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Compared to troponin alone, a dual-marker strategy with natriuretic peptides may improve acute coronary syndrome (ACS) diagnosis with a single blood draw and provide physiologic information regarding underlying heart disease. We evaluate the value of adding natriuretic peptides (myocyte stress markers) to troponins (myocardial injury markers) for diagnosing ACS in emergency department patients with chest pain.

- **Methods**: In 328 patients (53 ± 12 years, 63% men) with an initially negative conventional troponin and nonischemic electrocardiogram who underwent 64-slice cardiac computed tomography (CT), we measured conventional troponin-T (cTnT), high-sensitivity troponin-T (hsTnT), N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide, and mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide. ACS was defined as myocardial infarction or unstable angina. CT was evaluated for coronary plaque, stenosis, and regional wall motion abnormality.

- **Results**: Patients with ACS (n = 29, 9%) had higher concentrations of each biomarker compared to those without (all P < .01). Adding natriuretic peptides, especially N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide, to both cTnT or hsTnT improved the C-statistics and net reclassification index for ACS, largely driven by correctly reclassifying events. Dual-negative marker results improved sensitivity (cTnT 38% to 83%-86%, hsTnT 59% to 86%-90%; all P < .01) and negative predictive value (cTnT 94% to 97%-98%, hsTnT 96% to 97%-98%) for ACS. Patients with dual-negative markers had the lowest percentage of CT coronary plaque, stenosis, and regional wall motion abnormality.

### Implications of lowering threshold of plasma troponin concentration in diagnosis of myocardial infarction: Cohort study [^116qRCaD]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

To assess the relation between troponin concentration, assay precision, and clinical outcomes in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, a cohort study was conducted at a tertiary center in Scotland. The study involved 2,092 consecutive patients admitted with suspected acute coronary syndrome. These patients were stratified with a sensitive troponin I assay into three groups based on the following troponin concentration levels: < 0.012 µg/L, 0.012–0.049 µg/L, and ≥ 0.050 µg/L. The 99th centile for troponin concentration was determined as 0.012 µg/L with a coefficient of variation of 20.8%, and the diagnostic threshold was set at 0.050 µg/L with a coefficient of variation of 7.2%.

- **Main outcome measure**: One-year survival without events such as myocardial infarction and death in patients grouped by troponin concentration.

- **Results**

Troponin I concentrations were found to be < 0.012 µg/L in 988 patients (47%), 0.012–0.049 µg/L in 352 patients (17%), and ≥ 0.050 µg/L in 752 patients (36%). If the 99th centile were adopted, the number of individuals diagnosed with myocardial infarction would increase from 752 to 1,104, representing a relative increase of 47%. At the one-year mark, patients with troponin concentrations of 0.012–0.049 µg/L showed a higher likelihood of being deceased or readmitted with myocardial infarction compared to those with concentrations < 0.012 µg/L (13% vs. 3%, P < 0.001; odds ratio 4.7, 95% confidence interval 2.9 to 7.9). Patients with troponin levels of 0.012–0.049 µg/L, although having a higher risk profile, were less likely to be diagnosed with, investigated for, or treated for acute coronary syndrome compared to patients with troponin levels ≥ 0.050 µg/L.

The study concluded that lowering the diagnostic threshold to the 99th centile and accepting greater assay imp…

### New features of troponin testing in different clinical settings [^114RtLDP]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponin levels are routinely measured for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction. Cardiac troponin measurements also provide information concerning prognosis and the effect of early intervention in patients with acute coronary syndromes. The recent development of highly sensitive cardiac troponin assays permits detection of very low circulating levels. The use of sensitive troponin assays improves overall diagnostic accuracy in patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes, and these assays provide strong prognostic information in stable coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure. However, increased sensitivity comes with a cost of decreased specificity, and serial testing, as well as clinical context and judgment, is likely to become increasingly important in the interpretation of troponin assay results.

Methods

- **Study design and population**: Initial evaluation was performed as a secondary analysis of the High-Sensitivity Troponin in the Evaluation of Patients with Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome (High-STEACS) randomised controlled trial (NCT01852123), with external validation performed in the Advantageous Predictors of Acute Coronary Syndromes Evaluation (APACE) Study (NCT00470587).

Patients presenting with symptoms of suspected acute coronary syndrome were eligible for inclusion. Patients were excluded if the time from symptom onset to troponin sampling was not known, they had an adjudicated diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction, missing presentation high-sensitivity cardiac troponin measurement, or there was insufficient clinical information to adjudicate the diagnosis.

### Narrative review: Alternative causes for elevated cardiac troponin levels when acute coronary syndromes are excluded [^112W1ABT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the diagnosis of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction are largely based on an elevated troponin level. While this rapid and sensitive blood test is certainly valuable in the appropriate setting, its widespread use in a variety of clinical scenarios may lead to the detection of troponin elevation in the absence of thrombotic acute coronary syndromes.

Many diseases, such as sepsis, hypovolemia, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, myocarditis, myocardial contusion, and renal failure, can be associated with an increase in troponin level. These elevations may arise from various causes other than thrombotic coronary artery occlusion. Given the lack of any supportive data at present, patients with nonthrombotic troponin elevation should not be treated with antithrombotic and antiplatelet agents. Rather, the underlying cause of the troponin elevation should be targeted. However, troponin elevation in the absence of thrombotic acute coronary syndromes still retains prognostic value. Thus, cardiac troponin elevations are common in numerous disease states and do not necessarily indicate the presence of a thrombotic acute coronary syndrome.

While troponin is a sensitive biomarker to "rule out" non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, it is less useful to "rule in" this event because it may lack specificity for acute coronary syndromes.

### Proportional troponin changes and risk for outcomes with intervention strategies in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome across kidney function [^1173umFS]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Low credibility.

This analysis evaluates whether proportional serial cardiac troponin (cTn) change predicts benefit from early versus delayed invasive, or conservative treatment strategies across kidney function in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS).

Patients diagnosed with NSTE-ACS in the Veterans Health Administration between 1999 and 2022 were categorized into terciles (80%) of proportional change in serial cTn. The primary outcome included mortality or rehospitalization for myocardial infarction at 6 and 12 months in survivors of the index admission. Adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for the primary outcome for an early invasive (≤ 24h of the index admission), delayed invasive (> 24h of index admission to 90-days postdischarge), or conservative management.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was more prevalent (45.3%) in the lowest tercile, compared to 42.2% and 43% in the middle and highest terciles, respectively. More than 80% proportional change demonstrated HR (95% CI) of 0.90 (0.83–0.97) and 0.93 (0.88–1.00; p = 0.041) for the primary outcome at 6 and 12 months, respectively, when an early versus delayed invasive strategy was used across CKD stages.

Overall, the invasive strategy was safe and associated with improved outcomes across kidney function in NSTE-ACS. Additionally, more than 80% proportional change in serial troponin levels was observed.

### Convalescent troponin and cardiovascular death following acute coronary syndrome [^114rTzVA]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

In the evaluation of patients following hospitalization with acute coronary syndrome, convalescent high-sensitivity cardiac troponin conveys powerful long-term prognostic information that adds substantially to currently recognized clinical risk predictors and scores. Indeed, even after adjustment for the GRACE score, we identified a fivefold increase in risk of cardiovascular death associated with increasing convalescent troponin concentrations. This gradient of risk was continuous across the range of troponin concentrations and was greatest for cardiac events, including cardiac death and heart failure hospitalization.

Our study has several important strengths. First, the availability of comprehensive outcome data with more than 200 cardiovascular deaths during up to 9 years of follow-up is a major asset and enabled us to define the long-term prognostic significance of convalescent measurement of troponin. Second, the deliberately broad inclusion criteria ensured recruitment of a diverse and representative cohort of real-world patients with acute coronary syndrome. The even distribution of patients across low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups as determined by the GRACE risk score offers strong evidence as to the generalizability of our findings. Third, detailed characterization with repeated clinical, biochemical, and echocardiographic assessments at three time points allowed us to explore patterns of change in convalescent troponin concentrations, and how these correlate with both patient characteristics and long-term outcomes.

### Interpreting troponin in renal disease: A narrative review for emergency clinicians [^115DMcyC]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) can experience several severe complications, including acute coronary syndrome (ACS). While troponin is the biomarker of choice for evaluation of ACS, interpretation of troponin in CKD/ESRD can be challenging.

This narrative review evaluates troponin elevation in patients with CKD/ESRD, identifying pitfalls in the evaluation with troponin, and provides an approach to using troponin in these high-risk patients. Patients with CKD/ESRD are at greater risk for ACS and possess higher levels of circulating troponin; relatedly, these patients often present atypically for ACS.

- **Pitfalls in troponin use**: Several pitfalls must be considered in the use of troponin when evaluating for ACS. While troponin elevation in patients with CKD/ESRD is often considered to be due to underlying renal disease, this elevation has several etiologies, including uremic skeletal myopathy, microinfarctions, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), decreased clearance, and unrecognized congestive heart failure (CHF).

- **Nuanced approach required**: Utilizing troponin assays in this patient population requires a nuanced approach, as the sensitivity and specificity for troponin testing in CKD varies. Concern for ACS with elevated troponin warrants treatment for ACS until proven otherwise, with consideration of atypical presentations along with other causes for patient symptoms that may result in troponin elevation.

Patients with CKD/ESRD presenting with symptoms concerning for ACS are challenging, and the utilization of troponin assays is important in this population.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays for cardiovascular risk stratification in the general population [^1131EceE]. European Heart Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponins (cTns) I and T have long been the most successful cardiac-specific circulating biomarkers in cardiovascular (CV) medicine, having dramatically changed the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, while being independent predictors of outcomes in several cardiac and non-cardiac conditions. The latest-generation high-sensitivity (hs) cTn assays demonstrate both enhanced diagnostic performance and improved analytical performance, with the ability to measure detectable concentrations in a substantial proportion of asymptomatic and presumably healthy populations. Given this unique analytical feature, recent evidence suggests that hs-cTn can be used for the stratification of CV risk in the general population.

High-sensitivity cTn predicts future CV events, is responsive to preventive pharmacological or lifestyle interventions, changes in parallel with risk modifications, and offers incremental risk prediction when added to well-established prognosticators. The implementation of CV risk stratification and prevention strategies incorporating hs-cTn requires further investigation to define the optimal target populations, timing of measurement, and preventive interventions.

### What US cardiology can learn from the 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes [^113fb6dS]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

The spectrum of clinical presentations, electrocardiographic findings, and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin levels in patients with acute coronary syndrome is critical for diagnosis and management.

As noted, the initial assessment for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) includes the electrocardiogram, physical examination, clinical history, vital signs, and high-sensitivity troponin trends. An ST elevation myocardial infarction (MI) is readily apparent from the electrocardiogram. However, patients with non-ST elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS) should be divided into those with very high-risk features and those without such features.

- **Very high-risk features**: Include hemodynamic instability or cardiogenic shock; ongoing chest pain refractory to medical management; acute heart failure presumed secondary to ongoing myocardial ischemia; life-threatening arrhythmias or cardiac arrest after presentation; mechanical complications; or dynamic electrocardiographic changes suggestive of ischemia.

Patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) require immediate angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as appropriate, or thrombolysis if timely PCI is not feasible. This is also the case for NSTE-ACS patients with very high-risk features. For NSTE-ACS patients without very high-risk features, angiography should be considered within the initial 24 hours. The results of angiography determine the need for PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Consideration of long-term medical therapy and lifestyle measures is warranted, with an emphasis on smoking cessation.

### Cardiac troponin I elevation in hospitalized patients without acute coronary syndromes [^1138BnAf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Increase of cardiac troponins occurs in a variety of clinical situations in the absence of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Few data exist regarding the incidence, clinical characteristics, and predictive value of various cardiac diagnostic tests and the outcome of patients with a non-ACS-related troponin increase.

This study involved 883 consecutive hospitalized patients with increased cardiac troponin I levels. The discharge diagnosis was reclassified, and the troponin increase attributed to ACS or another process. Clinical data and results of cardiac diagnostic tests were collected, and patients were followed for a median of 30 months. Of these patients, 311 (35.2%) were classified as having a non-ACS-related troponin increase. An alternative explanation for troponin increase was found in 99% of these patients.

Troponin level had poor accuracy in discriminating patients with and without ACS (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve 0.63). Coronary angiography was frequently unhelpful in excluding a non-ACS-related troponin increase because 77% of patients in the non-ACS group had significant flow-limiting coronary artery disease.

Patients with non-ACS-related troponin increase had significantly higher in-hospital (hazard ratio 2.8, 95% confidence interval 2.0 to 3.8) and long-term (hazard ratio 2.0, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 2.5) mortalities compared with patients with ACS. In conclusion, cardiac troponin level is frequently increased in hospitalized patients in the absence of an ACS and portends poor short- and long-term outcomes.

### Early diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome [^112jFgm9]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation of acute chest pain has been augmented in recent years by advances in the sensitivity and precision of cardiac troponin assays, new biomarkers, improvements in imaging modalities, and the release of new clinical decision algorithms. This progress has enabled physicians to diagnose or rule out acute myocardial infarction earlier after the initial patient presentation, usually in emergency department settings. This can facilitate the prompt initiation of evidence-based treatments, investigation of alternative diagnoses for chest pain, or discharge, and permit better utilization of healthcare resources.

A non-trivial proportion of patients fall into an indeterminate category according to rule-out algorithms, and minimal evidence-based guidance exists for the optimal evaluation, monitoring, and treatment of these patients. The Cardiovascular Round Table of the ESC proposes approaches for the optimal application of early strategies in clinical practice to improve patient care following the review of recent advances in the early diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome.

- **Indeterminate patient categories considered**:
	- Patients with symptoms and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin at the 99th percentile but without dynamic change.
	- Patients with symptoms and high-sensitivity troponin above the 99th percentile and dynamic change but without coronary plaque rupture/erosion.

### Sex-specific thresholds of high-sensitivity troponin in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome [^113g3wSn]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Important disparities exist in the diagnosis, management, and outcomes of acute coronary syndrome between women and men. Women with suspected acute coronary syndrome are less likely to undergo evidence-based investigations and treatment, and outcomes following myocardial infarction are consistently poorer compared with men.

The development of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays has resulted in the identification of important sex differences in the reference range of cardiac troponin, with the 99th centile in men being twice that in women. We have previously demonstrated that the use of a high-sensitivity assay with sex-specific thresholds may double the diagnosis of myocardial infarction in women and identify women at risk for future cardiac events. This raises the question as to whether the use of single diagnostic thresholds has contributed to inequalities in the diagnosis, management, and outcomes of women with acute coronary syndrome.

The recently published fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction recommends the use of sex-specific thresholds for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction. High-STEACS (High-Sensitivity Troponin in the Evaluation of Patients With Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome) was the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate the introduction of a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) assay with sex-specific thresholds into clinical practice. The hs-cTnI assay reclassified 1 in 6 patients with myocardial injury, but this was not associated with a reduction in myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death at one year.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I at presentation in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome: a cohort study [^113jyGg7]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

Suspected acute coronary syndrome is the most common reason for emergency hospital admission and places a significant burden on health-care resources. Strategies to identify low-risk patients suitable for immediate discharge would have major benefits.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 6,304 consecutively enrolled patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome presenting to four secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Scotland. Plasma troponin concentrations were measured at presentation using a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay. In both derivation and validation cohorts, we assessed the negative predictive value of various troponin concentrations for the primary outcome of index myocardial infarction, or subsequent myocardial infarction or cardiac death within 30 days. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT01852123).

- **Findings**: Of the 4,870 patients in the derivation cohort, 782 (16%) experienced an index myocardial infarction. An additional 32 (1%) re-presented with myocardial infarction, and 75 (2%) experienced cardiac deaths within 30 days. Among patients without myocardial infarction at presentation, 2,311 out of 3,799 (61%) had troponin concentrations less than 5 ng/L, with a negative predictive value of 99.6% (95% CI 99.3–99.8) for the primary outcome. The negative predictive value was consistent across groups stratified by age, sex, risk factors, and previous cardiovascular disease. In two independent validation cohorts, troponin concentrations were less than 5 ng/L in 594 out of 1,061 patients (56%), with an overall negative predictive value of 99.4% (98.8–99.7).

### Point-of-care testing with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays: The challenges and opportunities [^114Swbqg]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Methods to improve the safety, accuracy, and efficiency of assessing patients with suspected acute coronary symptoms have been the focus of decades of study, leading to significant changes in clinical practice. Much of the progress relies on the results of laboratory-based high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays, which can detect low concentrations with high precision. Until recently, point-of-care (POC) platforms were unable to perform with similar analytical precision as laboratory-based assays; therefore, recommendations for their use in accelerated assessment strategies for patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome have been limited. As POC assays can provide troponin results within 20 minutes and be used proximate to patient care, improvements in the efficiency of assessing patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome are possible, particularly with new high-sensitivity assays.

### Contemporary point of care cardiac troponin testing in suspected acute coronary syndrome [^112pPb7p]. Heart (2019). High credibility.

Around one million patients present to hospitals with chest pain every year, accounting for approximately 5% of all emergency department attendances in the UK. However, only one in five patients is found to have had a myocardial infarction. Therefore, for several years, there has been a drive to develop diagnostic strategies that allow accurate identification of patients without myocardial infarction at an earlier stage, who may not require admission to the hospital for serial cardiac biomarker testing. Such strategies have the potential to improve patient experience and optimize resource allocation both in the emergency department and in the hospital, especially given the ever-increasing demands.

Cardiac troponin is the biomarker of choice for the detection of myocardial injury, and international guidelines recommend that concentrations be measured using a high-sensitivity assay. While high-sensitivity assays were first introduced in Europe in 2010, they have only recently become available for clinical practice in the United States. The higher precision and lower limits of detection afforded by these tests have facilitated the development of pathways that can rule out myocardial infarction at an earlier stage. The majority of these pathways have demonstrated significant benefits in diagnostic accuracy compared to using the recommended diagnostic threshold (99th percentile) alone. In practical terms, implementing these approaches requires investment in infrastructure to deliver accurate and timely cardiac troponin results on a high-sensitivity platform, which is not always available.

The 2025 ACC/ACEP/AHA/NAEMSP/SCAI guideline addresses diagnostic investigations for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, particularly concerning cardiac troponin. The guidelines recommend obtaining cardiac troponin as soon as possible in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, preferably using a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assay.

### Troponin: An important prognostic marker and risk-stratification tool in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes [^112LLxUX]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, there has been a progressive evolution of cardiac marker testing in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). This evolution has not only resulted in a dramatic shift in how myocardial infarction (MI) is diagnosed, but it has also extended the role of cardiac marker testing into risk stratification and guidance of treatment decisions. By the year 2000, the development of highly sensitive and cardiac-specific troponin assays led to a consensus change in the definition of MI, placing increased emphasis on cardiac marker testing with troponins as the new gold standard.

Furthermore, and perhaps more importantly, the role of troponins as superior markers of subsequent cardiac risk in ACS patients became firmly established. Most recently, the supportive role of these markers in identifying patients with ACS who may derive particular benefit from potent anti-thrombotic and anti-platelet therapy or early invasive treatment strategies has been demonstrated. This paper reviews the evolution of these important roles of troponin testing for risk stratification in ACS.

### Low-level troponin elevations following a reduced troponin I cutoff: Increased resource utilization without improved outcomes [^113jAu4Z]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to evaluate changes in mortality and resource utilization in patients with low-level troponin elevations following a reduction in the cutoff for normal troponin I (TnI) from 0.5 ng/mL to the 99th percentile (0.06 ng/mL).

This was an interrupted time series comparing emergency department (ED) patients with possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and TnI values 0.06–0.5 ng/mL before and after an institutional decrease in the TnI cutoff. The primary outcome was overall mortality at 90 days. Secondary outcomes included rates of rehospitalization, subsequent ACS, and coronary intervention within 90 days, as well as rates of anticoagulation, cardiology consultation, cardiac testing, and coronary intervention during the index visit. Outcomes for the pre-cutoff change group (control) and post-cutoff change group (post) were compared using tests of proportions and odds ratios.

The study included a total of 1058 subjects with 529 in each cohort. No significant differences in 90-day outcomes were observed between groups, including mortality (13.2% post vs. 14.1% control, OR 0.93 [95% CI: 0.65–1.34], p = 0.705). During the index visit, the post-group demonstrated higher rates of cardiology consultation (55.4% vs. 41.2%, OR 1.77 [1.39–2.26], p < 0.0001) and cardiac stress testing (16.4% vs. 10.6%, OR 1.66 [1.16–2.38], p = 0.006), but no significant differences in coronary intervention or short-term mortality were observed.

In conclusion, a reduction in the TnI cutoff to the 99th percentile did not change mortality or rates of coronary intervention.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, specifically concerning cardiac troponin, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining additional testing after 3 hours. This is advised if the first two high-sensitivity cardiac troponin measurements of the 0 hour/1 hour algorithm are inconclusive and no alternative diagnoses explaining the condition have been identified.

### The prognostic value of high sensitivity troponin T 7 weeks after an acute coronary syndrome [^116ERRCm]. Heart (2012). High credibility.

The role of high sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) in the risk stratification of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is now well established and widely practiced in many hospitals. hs-TnT improves early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and aids in identifying patients at higher risk of future adverse events when compared with the conventional troponin assay. This prognostic role for hs-TnT has also been extended to patients with stable chronic coronary artery disease.

In this study, we evaluated the role of hs-TnT during the convalescence phase after an ACS event. This is potentially important as it could further guide medium-term treatment options in this patient cohort. We assessed the prognostic utility of a single hs-TnT level 7 weeks post-ACS. Additionally, we evaluated whether upward and downward trends of hs-TnT between the index admission and 7 weeks post-ACS had any association with prognosis.

We also sought to assess the correlation between a 7-week hs-TnT and various adverse echo parameters, determining whether its prognostic value is independent of echo abnormalities, with a particular focus on the presence or absence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). Lastly, we compared a 7-week hs-TnT with a 7-week B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) regarding which better predicts prognosis after ACS.

### Temporal evolution of serum concentrations of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin during 1 year after acute coronary syndrome admission [^116U5eAw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponins (hs-cTns) are now widely used in clinical practice and are key elements in diagnosing myocardial infarction (MI) in patients presenting with ischemic chest pain. In the setting of suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS), high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) have a comparable good performance and are practically interchangeable. However, hs-cTns are now also measured for purposes other than diagnosing ACS, for example, as part of perioperative care, and studies comparing hs-cTnI concentrations and hs-cTnT concentrations outside the setting of ACS are scarce and mostly performed in the general population.

In this study, we used the BIOMArCS (Biomarker Study to Identify the Acute Risk of a Coronary Syndrome) with high-frequency blood sampling, investigating in detail the evolution of hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT concentrations until 1 year after ACS admission. We aimed to describe the differences in post-ACS kinetics and the differences in hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT concentrations after the biomarker reached stable levels. In addition, we explored the biological variation of cardiac troponins, measured with contemporary high-sensitivity assays.

### Increasingly sensitive assays for cardiac troponins: a review [^114grbem]. JAMA (2013). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponins are the preferred biomarkers for diagnosing myocardial infarction due to their high sensitivity and specificity for myocardial injury. However, acute and chronic conditions distinct from acute coronary syndromes (ACS) often lead to small elevations in troponin levels, with limited data available regarding patient care management in such scenarios.

Recently developed highly sensitive troponin assays are anticipated to significantly increase the detection of troponin levels attributable to non-ACS conditions. Novel algorithms utilizing highly sensitive assays, which incorporate baseline troponin values and monitor changes over 1 to 2 hours, may enable the rapid exclusion of myocardial infarction and help address specificity concerns. These algorithms, however, must be validated within appropriate target populations.

Enhanced detection of very low troponin levels with highly sensitive assays has made several potential new indications for troponin testing feasible, including in the ambulatory setting. In this context, assessing low-level chronic myocardial injury may improve risk stratification for heart failure and cardiac death.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, specifically concerning cardiac troponin, the ACC/ACEP/AHA/NAEMSP/SCAI 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining repeat measurements in patients with suspected ACS. This should occur with an initial nondiagnostic high-sensitivity cardiac troponin or cardiac troponin at 1–2 hours for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin and at 3–6 hours for conventional cardiac troponin after the initial sample collection.

### Role of troponin in patients with chronic kidney disease and suspected acute coronary syndrome: A systematic review [^115c98w9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a high prevalence of elevated serum troponin levels, which makes the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) challenging.

- **Purpose**: To evaluate the utility of troponin in ACS diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis among patients with CKD.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through May 2014.

- **Study selection**: Studies examining elevated versus normal troponin levels in terms of their diagnostic performance in the detection of ACS, effect on ACS management strategies, and prognostic value for mortality or cardiovascular events after ACS among patients with CKD.

- **Data extraction**: Paired reviewers selected articles for inclusion, extracted data, and graded the strength of evidence (SOE).

- **Data synthesis**: Twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria. The sensitivity of troponin T for ACS diagnosis ranged from 71% to 100%, and specificity ranged from 31% to 86% (6 studies; low SOE). The sensitivity and specificity of troponin I ranged from 43% to 94% and from 48% to 100%, respectively (8 studies; low SOE). No studies examined how troponin levels affect management strategies. Twelve studies analyzed prognostic value. Elevated levels of troponin I or troponin T were associated with a higher risk for short-term death and cardiac events (low SOE). A similar trend was observed for long-term mortality with troponin I (low SOE), but less evidence was found for long-term cardiac events for troponin I and long-term outcomes for troponin T (insufficient SOE). Patients with advanced CKD tended to have poorer outcomes.
