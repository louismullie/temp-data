## Question

How should an oral hematoma on the roof of the mouth that won't stop bleeding be managed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage an oral hematoma on the roof of the mouth that won't stop bleeding. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization with a strict ABCDE approach and airway risk, especially with oropharyngeal bleeding. Then, I should verify first-line local hemostatic strategies, including compression and topical tranexamic acid. Next, I'll assess pharmacologic adjuncts and reversal of antithrombotics. After that, I need to check systemic contributors and lab-guided correction of coagulopathy. Then, I should escalate to invasive local measures if bleeding persists, and consider interventional radiology for refractory cases. Finally, I must plan airway surveillance, post-control care, and evaluate underlying etiologies to prevent recurrence.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities: airway protection and hemodynamic stabilization come before everything else, given the risk that palatal or oropharyngeal hematomas can rapidly compromise the airway and deteriorate into a cannot-intubate, cannot-oxygenate scenario, which may necessitate an early surgical airway rather than repeated failed attempts at endotracheal intubation in the setting of expanding hematoma and ongoing bleeding [^112xaikE] [^117FAGZt] [^114AFysp] [^111G5dC4].

> I should confirm the hemodynamic status and bleeding risk factors immediately, including a focused history for antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents, liver disease, inherited bleeding disorders, or recent dental/oral procedures, because these factors increase the severity and frequency of mucosal bleeding and will alter both local and systemic management decisions [^111s4Kyi].

> Next, I will apply first-line local hemostatic measures with firm, sustained direct compression on the bleeding palatal site for at least 10–15 minutes, ideally with gauze soaked in topical tranexamic acid if available, as compression augmented by TXA is highly effective for mucosal bleeding control and reduces short-term rebleeding in epistaxis, with similar principles applicable to the oral cavity and post-extraction mucosae [^113gtwHp] [^116F9puq] [^114ggLUk].

> Wait, let me verify optimal supportive positioning and simple adjuncts while I compress the lesion; keeping the patient upright or with the head elevated is preferred to lower venous pressure and reduce dependent pooling, and cold application externally may further augment vasoconstriction and comfort, consistent with general mucosal bleeding care principles used in epistaxis and outpatient control strategies, but I should avoid dependent or supine positioning if it worsens oropharyngeal pooling of blood and aspiration risk [^114zpvtu] [^111WAqNw].

> I will now examine the role of topical vasoconstrictors as adjuncts, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; while oxymetazoline is guideline-supported for nasal mucosa, direct translation to palatal mucosa is uncertain and may not be as effective or appropriate, so if I initially consider oxymetazoline-soaked pledgets on the palate, I should immediately pause and correct that approach by prioritizing TXA-soaked compression and, if needed, carefully applied local hemostatic agents or infiltrative solutions used in oral surgery settings, recognizing that the evidence base for vasoconstrictors is stronger in nasal epistaxis than on oral mucosa [^112Smkjh] [^114ggLUk].

> Let me think about systemic contributors and targeted pharmacologic reversal now, because persistent bleeding on the palate can be amplified by anticoagulants or platelet dysfunction; for warfarin-associated bleeding, I should confirm early administration of 4-factor PCC with 5–10 mg IV vitamin K as guideline-directed reversal, and for life-threatening bleeding on factor Xa inhibitors such as apixaban or rivaroxaban, consider andexanet alfa if available or 4-factor PCC if not, with anti-Xa levels measured and calibrated to agent when feasible to guide decisions, while for agents without specific antidotes like argatroban or fondaparinux, discontinuation plus local measures and supportive care are the mainstays [^115zE1sn] [^117Sckpn] [^114qUAv5] [^113t85Xc] [^1151NPT9] [^114Ksd9s].

> I should double-check platelet support thresholds and strategies; if there is thrombocytopenia below approximately 50,000/µL or known qualitative platelet dysfunction with uncontrolled mucosal bleeding, platelet transfusion can be indicated, but I must balance this with the risks of alloimmunization, using leukoreduced and HLA-matched platelets when possible and reserving transfusion for bleeding not controlled with local measures or at critical sites [^116F9puq].

> Next, I should review core labs and correct physiologic derangements that worsen coagulopathy; I need a STAT CBC, PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen, and to correct hypothermia, acidosis, and hypocalcemia promptly, because these factors independently impair coagulation and predict higher transfusion needs and mortality in bleeding patients, and early, targeted hemostatic resuscitation is recommended in severe hemorrhage contexts to mitigate trauma-induced coagulopathy physiology, which can share features even in non-traumatic mucosal hemorrhage when blood loss is significant [^1157pzFM] [^113ytPQc].

> If bleeding persists beyond about 15–20 minutes despite optimal compression and TXA, I should escalate to invasive local interventions; let me first confirm whether there is a focal bleeding point amenable to cautery under direct visualization, using silver nitrate if feasible, and if not, consider suture techniques to compress the hematoma cavity or resorbable hemostatic packing such as gelatin sponge or oxidized cellulose shaped to the palatal contour, potentially combined with TXA, as supported by dental and mucosal bleeding literature and hemostatic matrix experience in oral surgery patients [^112Smkjh] [^114ggLUk] [^111im4Vk] [^116F9puq].

> Hold on, I should verify escalation thresholds for interventional radiology; if hemorrhage remains refractory after maximal local therapy or if there is suspicion of arterial injury or pseudoaneurysm from trauma, then I should proceed to urgent angiography and embolization of feeding branches, typically from the internal maxillary artery, because endovascular therapy is effective for intractable oronasal bleeding and is recommended when packing and cautery fail, in alignment with otolaryngology guidance for refractory mucosal hemorrhage [^112hgExK] [^113Z9G2i] [^11325iaR].

> I will now examine airway surveillance and post-control care; continuous pulse oximetry and repeated airway assessments are necessary because edema and hematoma expansion can evolve over 24–48 hours, and I need contingency plans for early surgical airway if deterioration occurs, particularly in anticoagulated patients with lingual or pharyngeal hematomas, as shown in case-based literature and difficult-airway experiences in oropharyngeal hemorrhage [^114AFysp] [^111G5dC4] [^1145dKg3].

> Wait, I notice a contradiction in the original trace about positioning after hemostasis suggesting the supine position to reduce venous effects; let me reconsider and correct that to head elevation or upright posture to limit venous congestion and aspiration risk while maintaining gentle local pressure with a bite block or rolled gauze, adding cold swish if tolerated and scheduling TXA mouth rinse every 6–8 hours as an adjunctive measure for mucosal stability, with rebleeding checks over the next 24–48 hours informed by short-term outcomes seen with TXA in epistaxis cohorts and oral mucosal care practices [^113gtwHp] [^114zpvtu] [^116F9puq].

> I should confirm analgesia and co-medication choices; NSAIDs should be avoided due to reversible platelet inhibition and bleeding risk, favoring acetaminophen or short-course opioids if needed, and if extensive packing or devitalized tissue is present, I need to consider infection risk and discuss antibiotics pragmatically, acknowledging that posterior nasal packing data highlight infectious complications and monitoring needs, which can inform similar vigilance when packing the oral cavity [^112TSeGs] [^111WAqNw].

> But wait, what if the "palatal hematoma" is part of a specific mucosal blistering disorder rather than a traumatic bleed alone; I need to ensure I investigate the underlying cause, including anticoagulant effects, liver disease, VWD or other inherited bleeding disorders, and less common oral entities like angina bullosa hemorrhagica that present with sudden, blood-filled palatal bullae and spontaneous resolution, because identifying etiology guides prevention and follow-up, and documentation of bleeding risk factors is explicitly recommended in mucosal bleeding guidelines [^111s4Kyi] [^113yv2Tj] [^114vdQTn] [^116BJFUE].

> Finally, I should double-check discharge planning and follow-up; patients need clear instructions on local pressure techniques, TXA rinse use if prescribed, avoidance of traumatic foods and NSAIDs, signs of rebleeding that warrant immediate return, and prompt ENT or oral surgery follow-up for reassessment, which aligns with patient education principles after mucosal packing or cautery and with the general emphasis on structured aftercare to reduce recurrence and complications [^1127WPDc] [^112Smkjh].

> In summary, let me verify that the key steps are coherently sequenced: secure the airway early when threatened, apply direct compression with TXA as first-line local therapy, reverse anticoagulation based on the agent with PCC and vitamin K for VKAs and andexanet or PCC for factor Xa inhibitors, correct systemic coagulopathy drivers, escalate to cautery, suturing, and resorbable hemostatic packing if needed, and proceed to angiographic embolization for refractory arterial bleeding, with vigilant airway surveillance and prevention strategies to address underlying causes and prevent recurrence, all consistent with the cited guidelines and evidence base [^112xaikE] [^113gtwHp] [^115zE1sn] [^117Sckpn] [^112Smkjh] [^113Z9G2i].

---

Persistent bleeding from a palatal hematoma is a **medical emergency** [^117FAGZt] due to the risk of airway compromise and significant blood loss. Immediate priorities are to **secure the airway** [^112xaikE] and **apply direct pressure** [^116fbWz4] with a hemostatic agent (e.g. oxidized cellulose, tranexamic acid-soaked gauze) [^116F9puq]. If bleeding persists, **escalate to electrocautery** or surgical ligation [^113Z9G2i]; for refractory cases, consider transarterial embolization [^112hgExK]. Concurrently, **reverse anticoagulation** with PCC and vitamin K for warfarin [^115zE1sn], andexanet alfa for factor Xa inhibitors [^117Sckpn], or idarucizumab for dabigatran; correct coagulopathy with platelets, fibrinogen, and tranexamic acid as indicated [^1157pzFM]. Monitor closely for rebleeding and airway compromise [^117GDDBX], and **admit to a high-acuity setting** for ongoing management.

---

## Immediate clinical assessment and stabilization

### Airway management

Because palatal hematomas can rapidly expand and obstruct the airway, the **risk of airway compromise** is high [^111G5dC4]; securing the airway is the first priority [^112xaikE]. Airway strategies include **supraglottic devices** or **endotracheal intubation** [^112xaikE]; if these fail or are not feasible, perform a **surgical airway** (tracheostomy or cricothyrotomy) [^114AFysp].

---

### Hemodynamic stabilization

Establish large-bore **IV access** for fluid resuscitation and blood product administration [^1157pzFM], and continuously monitor **vital signs**, including oxygen saturation and mental status.

---

## Local hemostatic measures

### Direct pressure and topical agents

Apply firm, sustained **direct pressure** [^116fbWz4] using gauze or a hemostatic agent (e.g. oxidized cellulose, gelatin sponge, tranexamic acid-soaked gauze) [^111im4Vk]. Consider **topical vasoconstrictors**, such as epinephrine-soaked gauze, to reduce bleeding [^112Smkjh].

---

### Surgical interventions

- **Electrocautery**: Use electrocautery or bipolar diathermy for persistent bleeding after local measures [^112Smkjh].

- **Surgical ligation**: Ligate identified bleeding vessels (e.g. greater palatine artery) if accessible [^113Z9G2i].

- **Transarterial embolization**: For refractory bleeding, consider embolization of the feeding vessel [^112hgExK].

---

## Systemic factors contributing to persistent bleeding

### Coagulopathies and anticoagulant medications

Evaluate for **coagulopathies** — inherited (e.g. hemophilia, von Willebrand disease) or acquired (e.g. liver disease, DIC) [^117GDDBX] — and recognize that **anticoagulants** (warfarin, direct oral anticoagulants [DOACs], and antiplatelet agents) can significantly increase bleeding risk.

---

### Management of anticoagulant-related bleeding

- **Warfarin reversal**: Administer prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and intravenous vitamin K (5–10 mg) [^115zE1sn].

- **DOAC reversal**: Use andexanet alfa for factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban) and idarucizumab for dabigatran [^117Sckpn].

- **Antiplatelet agents**: Consider platelet transfusion if bleeding is severe and platelet dysfunction is suspected [^116F9puq].

---

## Indications for escalation to surgical intervention

- **Failure of conservative measures**: Persistent bleeding despite direct pressure, topical agents, and local hemostatic measures [^113Z9G2i].

- **Identifiable bleeding vessel**: Visible or accessible vessel amenable to ligation or cauterization [^111WAqNw].

- **Refractory bleeding**: Continued bleeding despite reversal of anticoagulation and correction of coagulopathy [^112hgExK].

- **Airway compromise**: Rapidly expanding hematoma threatening airway patency [^117FAGZt].

---

## Post-procedural monitoring and follow-up care

### Monitoring for rebleeding and complications

Provide **close observation** for rebleeding, hematoma expansion, and airway compromise [^117GDDBX]. Repeat coagulation studies (PT, aPTT, INR, platelet count) to ensure stability [^1157pzFM], and obtain CT angiography or MRI if recurrent bleeding or vascular anomalies are suspected [^111SzBs1].

---

### Patient education and follow-up

Emphasize **recognizing signs of rebleeding**, hematoma expansion, and airway compromise. Arrange follow-up to monitor healing and address underlying systemic factors, and counsel on avoiding trauma, maintaining oral hygiene, and adhering to medication adjustments [^1127WPDc].

---

Persistent bleeding from a palatal hematoma requires a structured approach: **secure the airway** [^112xaikE], apply local hemostatic measures, reverse anticoagulation, and escalate to surgery or embolization as needed [^113Z9G2i]. Close monitoring and follow-up are essential to prevent recurrence and complications [^117GDDBX].

### Treatment of inherited thrombocytopenias [^116F9puq]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

Localized measures are often effective for mucocutaneous hemorrhages. For example, nasal packing and/or endoscopic cauterization may successfully stop epistaxis, while suturing can halt bleeding from accidental or surgical wounds, such as post-tooth extraction bleeding. Additionally, compression and the application of gelatin sponges or gauzes soaked in tranexamic acid are methods that can stop bleeding from superficial wounds. For gum bleeding, a mouthwash with tranexamic acid may be beneficial.

Platelet transfusions are the most effective intervention for halting bleeding in individuals with inherited thrombocytopenias (IT). However, they carry risks, including acute reactions, transmission of infectious agents, transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GvHD), and alloimmunization, which can lead to refractoriness to subsequent transfusions. The development of antibodies against donor HLA antigens poses a substantial threat for IT patients who may remain thrombocytopenic permanently, potentially jeopardizing future platelet support and their lives. Consequently, platelet transfusions should be restricted to situations where bleeding cannot be controlled with localized measures, involves life-threatening hemorrhages, or occurs at critical sites.

To reduce the risk of alloimmunization when platelet transfusion is necessary, two strategies are effective: using leukoreduced platelet concentrates and HLA-matched donors.

### Transarterial embolization for traumatic intractable oronasal hemorrhage [^112hgExK]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Severe craniofacial injury may cause intractable oronasal bleeding, a rare but life-threatening surgical emergency that may occur in the Emergency Department (ED). Uncontrolled massive bleeding is the major cause of mortality. This kind of trauma is usually associated with the transfer of high kinetic energy, such as a motor vehicle collision.

- **Objective**: We report an unusual case of intractable oronasal bleeding diagnosed by angiography.

- **Case report**: A 43-year-old man was brought to the ED after being in a high-energy motor vehicle collision. He had suffered severe craniofacial trauma, including intracranial hemorrhage and intractable oronasal bleeding; he later developed a large pseudoaneurysm arising from the right internal maxillary artery. In the ED, the patient successfully underwent endovascular treatment (EVT) using angiography with transarterial embolization (TAE) therapy to control the bleeding.

- **Conclusion**: EVT by TAE for intractable oronasal bleeding was an effective treatment in this life-threatening situation.

### Treatment of inherited thrombocytopenias [^112TSeGs]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

Treatments to prevent bleeding in individuals with inherited thrombocytopenias (IT) mainly address hemostatic challenges, as most patients experience mild, moderate, or even absent spontaneous bleeding.

Simple and cost-effective general measures can significantly reduce the risk of bleeding in daily life. Preventing hemostatic challenges is an essential recommendation for patients with IT. Many drugs inhibit platelet function, increasing the risk of bleeding. Patients should avoid aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, as well as other common medications, such as certain antibiotics and antidepressants, which may also affect platelet function. It is crucial for patients to consult their physician prior to taking any medication to evaluate the risk-to-benefit ratio of each treatment.

For women with heavy menstruation, oral contraceptives can be effective in preventing or controlling menorrhagia. If iron deficiency anemia develops, it should be treated with iron supplements to enhance quality of life and prevent bleeding, as anemia might facilitate bleeding. In vitro studies indicate that red blood cells can push platelets towards the vessel wall, enhancing their hemostatic effect.

Dental interventions pose frequent hemostatic challenges; therefore, maintaining good oral hygiene and regular dental visits are essential to prevent these invasive procedures. Additionally, adhering to cancer screening programs is important for early detection and prevention of complications.

### Systemic thrombolysis in ischemic stroke after recent oral surgery and management of oral cavity bleeding [^114gL7M5]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke carries a long list of contraindications. One of these is recent surgery, but the extent of complications after minor surgeries such as dental extraction or oral surgical procedures is unclear. Here, we report the management of two cases with accidental bleeding from the oral cavity during systemic thrombolysis in ischemic stroke because of recent unreported oral surgery. Bleeding at the operation site occurred early and was stopped by the prompt discontinuation of the recombinant tissue plasminogen activator infusion and local compressive therapy. Patients and relatives may not be aware that surgical procedures within the oral cavity are regarded as minor surgery and should be explicitly asked during the evaluation of ischemic stroke within the period for thrombolysis.

### Radiological diagnosis and management of epistaxis [^111WAqNw]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

The management of epistaxis should begin with general measures, including calming the patient, possibly with sedatives if necessary, applying a cold compress to the nape of the neck, decreasing blood pressure if the patient is hypertensive, performing fluid resuscitation, and correcting any underlying coagulopathy.

- **Bleeding control methods**: Local measures include various methods such as applying haemostatic agents locally, infiltrating the bleeding area with vasoconstrictive agents, and performing cautery.

- **Anterior nasal packing**: This is achieved by positioning strips of ointment-saturated gauze to exert satisfactory pressure on the bleeding mucosa.

- **Posterior nasal packing**: If anterior packing is insufficient to stop the haemorrhage or if the bleeding originates posteriorly, posterior nasal packing is an option. This requires general anaesthesia. A balloon catheter is inflated in the nasopharynx to stop the posterior flow of blood, and the anterior part of the nasal cavity is packed. The catheter emerging from the nose is fixed in place. Patients should be monitored because posterior nasal packing can lead to nasal trauma, vasovagal reactions, and infection. Traditional gauze packing or balloon devices may remain in the nasal cavity for up to 48 hours to prevent complications. The success rate of posterior packing is reported to be between 48% and 83%.

- **Subsequent therapy**: This can include either surgical endonasal coagulation or ligation. An endoscopic approach has been used for direct electrocauterisation of the active bleeding site.

### Bleeding complications in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck [^111ye2ei]. Head & Neck (2021). Low credibility.

Each year, approximately 700,000 new cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are diagnosed in adults globally, with 380,000 deaths, including more than 10,000 in the United States alone. HNSCC is a heterogeneous disease and can arise in multiple anatomical locations within the head and neck area, including the lip and oral cavity, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, oropharynx, larynx, and nasopharynx.

Hemorrhage is a frequent problem for patients with recurrent and/or metastatic (R/M) HNSCC and can occur as either acute catastrophic events, episodic major bleeds, or ongoing low-volume oozing. In addition to spontaneous tumor bleeding, chemotherapy and local tumor irradiation have been reported as causes of hemorrhage in R/M HNSCC. The chances of bleeding in recurrent disease can be high considering tissue sequelae following previous chemoradiotherapy (CRT), and prior chemotherapy, in particular, can contribute to hemorrhage secondary to chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia.

Free radicals can trigger thrombosis, obliterate the adventitial vasa vasorum, and cause adventitial fibrosis, premature atherosclerosis, and weakening of the carotid arterial wall. This can result in carotid artery rupture (carotid blowout syndrome [CBS]), which requires prompt diagnosis and intervention to avert a fatal outcome. Furthermore, high fractional and total radiotherapy doses may influence the risk of vascular mucosal damage, especially in the repeat irradiation setting.

### Criteria for low von Willebrand factor diagnosis and risk score to predict future bleeding [^113yv2Tj]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Surgical procedures were defined as medical interventions that invade the body by cutting or puncturing the skin and/or by inserting instruments into the body, such as surgery, dental procedures, or invasive examinations. Because there is a large variability in the bleeding risk of such interventions, we have classified the bleeding risk of each intervention based on previous literature.

- **Major postsurgical bleeding**: Defined as bleeding requiring resurgery or blood transfusion.
- **Minor postsurgical bleeding**: Defined as bleeding requiring additional tranexamic acid (TXA), desmopressin, or VWF concentrates, or bleeding for which patients had to stay longer at the hospital or had to visit the outpatient department or emergency room of the Erasmus University Medical Center.

Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) was defined as blood loss ≥ 500 mL within 24 hours postpartum or bleeding for which curettage, additional TXA, desmopressin, or VWF concentrate was necessary. Severe PPH was defined as blood loss ≥ 1000 mL within 24 hours postpartum. Secondary PPH was defined as blood loss occurring between 24 hours and 6 weeks postpartum. Peripartum blood loss was estimated by the obstetrician‐gynecologist who supervised the delivery, as is routinely done in the Netherlands.

- **Trauma**: Defined as an event for which patients contacted the outpatient department or emergency room of the Erasmus University Medical Center.
- **Spontaneous or traumatic bleeding during follow‐up**: Defined as bleeding for which patients contacted the outpatient department or ER.

Last, bleeding definitions and classifications were consistently applied across our study.

### Management of the oral and maxillofacial surgery patient with thrombocytopenia [^116WTjJd]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Patients with disorders of coagulation and bleeding can be among the most challenging surgical patients to manage. Intraoperative or postoperative bleeding can contribute to life-threatening complications in even the most "benign" surgical procedures. An adequate number and function of platelets play a critical role in the coagulation pathway. A thorough understanding of platelet physiology and platelet disorders is therefore essential in the management of the thrombocytopathic oral and maxillofacial surgery patient. A careful preoperative evaluation will help the surgeon treat these patients and help prevent potentially catastrophic intraoperative or postoperative bleeding.

### Bleeding complications in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck [^113u1sBm]. Head & Neck (2021). Low credibility.

- **Therapies for HNSCC and risk of hemorrhage**: EGFR is overexpressed in the majority of HNSCC cases and is a well‐recognized therapeutic target. Clinical trials have examined the efficacy and safety of targeted anti‐EGFR agents such as cetuximab. However, based on available data, it remains unclear whether a causal association exists between the use of cetuximab‐based treatment regimens and occurrence of hemorrhage.

In a multinational randomized trial of high‐dose radiotherapy plus cetuximab versus high‐dose radiotherapy alone (424 patients with stage III or IV nonmetastatic, measurable HNSCC of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx), no hemorrhagic adverse events (AEs) were reported in either treatment arm. In an open‐label, uncontrolled multicenter phase II study of single‐agent cetuximab in patients with R/M HNSCC who experienced disease progression on platinum‐based therapy, the most common cetuximab‐related AEs were skin reactions. There was one treatment‐related death due to an uncommon infusion‐related reaction, but there were no reports of hemorrhage. Similarly, hemorrhage was not described among 117 evaluable patients in a randomized trial comparing cisplatin–cetuximab with cisplatin–placebo. However, the study reported grade 3 and 4 AEs only; it is unknown whether grade 1 or 2 hemorrhage events occurred.

In specific circumstances for bleeding in patients on antithrombotics, particularly regarding supratherapeutic INR without bleeding, BSH 2013 guidelines recommend administering 1–5 mg of oral vitamin K in asymptomatic patients with an INR > 8.0. A follow-up INR should be obtained the following day to determine if an additional dose of vitamin K is required.

### Juleber [^117WcdKk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In cases of breakthrough bleeding, as with all instances of irregular bleeding from the vagina, it is important to consider nonfunctional causes. When there is undiagnosed, persistent, or abnormal bleeding from the vagina, adequate diagnostic measures are recommended to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may resolve the problem. Changing to an oral contraceptive with a higher estrogen content, though potentially useful in minimizing menstrual irregularity, should be considered only if necessary since it may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease.

- **Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period**:
	1. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period, and oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.
	2. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.

### Unusual cause of recalcitrant epistaxis [^112v1d6k]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Nosebleeds are among the most familiar presentations to the emergency department and otorhinolaryngologic outpatient services. Bleeding from nasal septal branches of the anterior ethmoid artery (AEA) is common and can be effectively controlled endoscopically. However, bleeding from a pseudoaneurysm involving the nasal septal branches of the AEA is extremely rare and can be troublesome to control using endoscopic methods. We report an adult patient presenting with profuse nasal bleeding post-road traffic accident due to the formation of an AEA septal branch pseudoaneurysm. The patient required repeated nasal packing, and the diagnosis was revealed using digital subtraction angiography. Since profuse active bleeding precluded endoscopic visualization, an external approach had to be adopted to ligate the AEA to control the bleeding. We discuss the management options and nuances for this rare cause of troublesome nasal bleeding.

### Christmas disease: Diagnosis and management of a haemorrhagic diathesis following dentofacial trauma [^112fcgMk]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Haemorrhagic diathesis has been a significant concern for health professionals, including dentists. It is not infrequent for a dentist to become the first to diagnose a bleeding disorder during dental treatment. Haemophilia is an X-linked disorder with a frequency of about 1:10,000 births. Haemophilia B is much less common than haemophilia A, affecting only 1:300,000 males born alive. The clinical features of haemophilia B are very similar to those of haemophilia A, with a prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time.

This case report describes the dental management of a patient with an uncommon haematological disorder, namely, factor IX deficiency, which remained undiagnosed until the patient experienced dentofacial trauma with unexpected severe haemorrhage. Preventive dentistry remains vital for young haemophiliacs. Surgical dental procedures may be performed for haemophiliacs, but they must be judiciously coordinated by dental and medical health professionals.

### Evaluating effectiveness of nasal compression with tranexamic acid compared with simple nasal compression and Merocel packing: A randomized controlled trial [^113gtwHp]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

The primary objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of three treatment protocols to stop anterior epistaxis: classic compression, nasal packing, and local application of tranexamic acid. It also aims to determine the frequency of rebleeding after each of these protocols.

- **Methods**: This single-center, prospective, randomized controlled study was conducted with patients who had spontaneous anterior epistaxis. The study compared the effect of three treatment options: tranexamic acid with compression but without nasal packing, nasal packing (Merocel), and simple nasal external compression, on the primary outcome of stopping anterior epistaxis bleeding within 15 minutes.

- **Results**: Among the 135 patients enrolled, the median age was 60 years (interquartile range 25% to 75%: 48 to 72 years) and 70 patients (51.9%) were women. The success rate in the compression with tranexamic acid group was 91.1% (41 of 45 patients); in the nasal packing group, 93.3% (42 of 45 patients); and in the compression with saline solution group, 71.1% (32 of 45 patients). There was an overall statistically significant difference among the three treatment groups but no significant difference in pairwise comparison between the compression with tranexamic acid and nasal packing groups. In regard to no rebleeding within 24 hours, the study found rates of 86.7% in the tranexamic acid group, 74% in the nasal packing group, and 60% in the compression with saline solution group.

- **Conclusion**: Applying external compression after administering tranexamic acid through the nostrils by atomizer.

### Perioperative considerations in management of the severely bleeding coagulopathic patient [^1157pzFM]. Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

In the last decade, guidelines for perioperative bleeding report specific management algorithms and particularly emphasize the use of viscoelastic testing and the potential of targeted hemostatic resuscitation with coagulation factor concentrates. Strategies involved in the management of bleeding include controlled (e.g. cardiac or orthopedic surgery) and uncontrolled (e.g. trauma, postpartum hemorrhage) scenarios.

While hypothermia is sometimes used as a neuroprotective mechanism under controlled circumstances, inadvertent hypothermia is associated with dysregulation of coagulation enzymes, platelet dysfunction, fibrinolysis, endothelial injury, and worse outcomes. Recent guidelines recommend early application of measures to reduce heat loss to achieve and maintain normothermia (Grade 1C) to optimize coagulation. Additionally, metabolic acidosis and hypocalcemia often present in uncontrolled hemorrhage and are each associated with increased coagulopathy, transfusion requirements, and mortality. Hypocalcemia has been found in approximately 50% of severely injured patients and the majority of massive transfusion recipients.

### Local delivery of the hemostatic agent tranexamic acid in chronically anticoagulated patients [^111im4Vk]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

In oral surgery, the management of patients on anticoagulant therapy remains a challenge due to the risks of uncontrolled bleeding and the potential for undesired thromboembolic complications if therapy is discontinued. The use of local hemostatic agents may provide a viable alternative to address these issues. This study aimed to evaluate the use of newly developed swelling matrices loaded with tranexamic acid to prevent post-extractive bleeding in patients without altering their oral anticoagulant therapy. These matrices, composed of cellulose, are designed to conform to the three-dimensional post-extractive alveolar cavity, thereby providing mechanical support for hemostasis. The potential of this new therapeutic approach in reducing hospitalization, minimizing the risk of infections, and decreasing the incidence of hemorrhagic complications was demonstrated.

### Hemostatic resuscitation is neither hemostatic nor resuscitative in trauma hemorrhage [^1134geWk]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Trauma hemorrhage continues to carry a high mortality rate despite changes in modern practice. Traditional approaches to the massively bleeding patient have been shown to result in persistent coagulopathy, bleeding, and poor outcomes. Hemostatic (or damage control) resuscitation developed from the discovery of acute traumatic coagulopathy and increased recognition of the negative consequences of dilutional coagulopathy. These strategies concentrate on early delivery of coagulation therapy combined with permissive hypotension. The efficacy of hemostatic resuscitation in correcting coagulopathy and restoring tissue perfusion during acute hemorrhage has not been studied.

- **Methods**: This is a prospective cohort study of ROTEM and lactate measurements taken from trauma patients recruited to the multicenter Activation of Coagulation and Inflammation in Trauma (ACIT) study. A blood sample is taken on arrival and during the acute bleeding phase after administration of every 4 U of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), up to 12 U. The quantity of blood products administered within each interval is recorded.

- **Results**: Of the 106 study patients receiving at least 4 U of PRBC, 27 received 8 U to 11 U of PRBC, and 31 received more than 12 U of PRBC. Average admission lactate was 6.2 mEq/L. Patients with high lactate (≥ 5 mEq/L) on admission did not clear lactate until hemorrhage control was achieved, and no further PRBC units were required. On admission, 43% of the patients were coagulopathic (clot amplitude at 5 minutes ≤ 35 mm). This increased to 49% by PRBC 4; 62% by PRBC 8.

### Maxillofacial and neck trauma: a damage control approach [^113ytPQc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Hemostatic resuscitation generally considers post-traumatic coagulopathy to result from three main factors: 1) loss of procoagulant factors due to consumption and bleeding, 2) hemodilution caused by fluid resuscitation, and 3) coagulatory dysfunction arising from acidosis and hypothermia. However, an early form of coagulopathy referred to as "acute traumatic coagulopathy" is predominantly found in patients experiencing hypoperfusion. This condition is characterized by the up-regulation of endothelial thrombomodulin, which forms complexes with thrombin to promote anticoagulation, alongside hyperfibrinolysis induced by endothelial dysfunction. This form of coagulopathy is present in the most severely injured patients and is typically linked with poor outcomes.

Based on the above, hemostatic resuscitation could be considered the utilization of blood and blood products in the early treatment phases of traumatic coagulopathy. Adequate detection and treatment of post-traumatic coagulopathy require early and repeated monitoring of prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen levels, and platelet count. Moreover, the utilization of recently introduced viscoelastic testing, such as thrombelastography, may be useful for better characterization of an existing coagulopathy and management of hemostatic therapy. An ideal test (rapid, highly sensitive, etc) does not yet exist. For this reason, in the very early acute phases of trauma management, the decision to initiate clotting factor replacement is based primarily on clinical considerations.

### Pediatric epistaxis-effectiveness of conservative management [^1128Rk4r]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Low credibility.

Epistaxis is an emergency medical condition that sometimes requires admission to the emergency department. Pediatric epistaxis differs from epistaxis in the older population in terms of etiology, severity, and management. This study aimed to identify the distinctive features of pediatric epistaxis and determine the appropriate management.

This retrospective study analyzed 231 medical records of children under 18 years old with epistaxis, out of a total of 1171 cases in the general population, who presented to our medical center's emergency department between 2013 and 2018.

Among the 231 admissions, 10 children (4.3%) presented more than once. The majority of cases were male patients (64.5%), with an average age of 9.4 years. Two children were treated with aspirin due to cardiac valve disease. Anterior bleeding was detected in 101 cases (43.7%), while posterior origin was observed in 8 cases (3.5%). In 122 cases (52.8%), there was no active bleeding observed. Nose injury was the cause of epistaxis in 24 cases (10.4%), and 16 admissions (6.9%) followed nasal surgical interventions. Nineteen children (8%) had abnormal coagulation tests, and 7 patients (3%) received blood transfusions. Chemical cauterization was performed in 89 cases (39.3%), and anterior packing was needed in only 9 cases (3.9%). Nine children required hospitalization (3.9%), and 2 needed surgical intervention to control bleeding. Compared with the adult population, there were significantly fewer cases of active bleeding, re-epistaxis, anterior packing, or need for hospitalization.

### Recurrent hemorrhagic bullae of the oral mucosa [^116BJFUE]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following is not in the proposed diagnostic criteria for this condition?
A. Exclusively oral or oropharyngeal localization
B. Spontaneous resolution without scarring
C. Negative DIF
D. Family history of similar symptoms
E. Normal platelet count and coagulation studies

- **Answers**:
	- A. Exclusively oral or oropharyngeal localization – Incorrect. Diagnostic criteria for ABH were proposed by Ordioni et al. in 2019 (listed below). According to their proposal, meeting 6 of the 9 criteria, including criteria 1 (clinically visible hemorrhagic bullae with a history of bleeding) and criteria 2 (exclusively oral or oropharyngeal localization), is sufficient for a diagnosis of ABH. In this case, the patient met all 9 criteria and had a very classical presentation of ABH, including well-defined, blood-filled blisters in the oral cavity, which rapidly expanded before spontaneously rupturing and healing.

- **Diagnostic criteria for ABH proposed by Ordioni et al**:
	1. Clinically visible hemorrhagic bullae with a history of bleeding
	2. Exclusively oral or oropharyngeal localization
	3. Palate localization
	4. Triggering event or promoting factors (e.g. trauma, mastication)
	5. ReLesions
	6. Spontaneous resolution without scarring within a few days
	7. Lesions are either painless or associated with a tingling or burning sensation
	8. Normal platelet count and coagulation studies
	9. Negative direct immunofluorescence

B. Spontaneous resolution without scarring – Incorrect. Spontaneous resolution is part of the diagnostic criteria.

### Standardization of terminology, definitions, and outcome criteria for bleeding in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: International consensus report [^112J7ZQA]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

The aspirational goal of treatment for any disease is lasting cure. While a cure for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) may be possible in the future thanks to ongoing advances in cellular and genetic therapies, currently available therapeutics and those in development focus on minimizing and/or preventing bleeding. The evaluation of these specific goals in clinical studies and recommendations for proper clinical trial endpoints can be found in Sections 5 and 8.

- **Primary treatment goal**: The expert panel agreed that the primary goal of treatment of HHT‐associated bleeding is the reduction of duration, frequency, and/or intensity of epistaxis as well as the reduction of gastrointestinal blood loss (in those with gastrointestinal bleeding).

- **Secondary treatment goals**: The expert panel agreed that secondary goals of treatment of HHT‐associated bleeding — many of which are direct consequences of reducing epistaxis and gastrointestinal bleeding — include, in no particular order:
	1. Reduction of other sources of HHT‐associated bleeding (e.g. visceral and central nervous system AVM‐associated bleeding, and skin and oral cavity bleeding).
	2. Reduction of iron deficiency anemia, non‐anemic iron deficiency, and requirements for hematologic support, such as intravenous iron infusions and red cell transfusions.
	3. Improvement of health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) and reduction of psychosocial morbidity.
	4. Reduction of healthcare utilization, including emergency visits, hospital admissions, infusion center visits, and hemostatic surgeries.
	5. Reduction of mortality.

### Oropharyngeal hemorrhage and difficult airway management: A decision not to intubate [^1145dKg3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Bleeding in the upper airways is an important cause of airway-related death. A higher incidence of airway management failure and complications after intubation attempts in the emergency department (ED) has been suggested. Airway management of patients with active oropharyngeal hemorrhage may be challenging, leading the clinician to modify the approach.

- **Case report**: A 57-year-old woman presented to the ED with oropharyngeal hemorrhage after an extensive invasive dental procedure. She was on long-term warfarin therapy due to aortic and mitral valve replacement, which she suspended 5 days prior and restarted the day after the procedure. Besides the active bleeding, swelling, and hematoma of the face, the patient had other signs of a "difficult airway", raising serious questions about when and how to manage the airway. Several strategies to address the airway were considered, the main point being an early versus later intubation. As the patient remained clinically stable, she was conservatively managed with local hemostasis and coagulopathy reversal. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, where she remained stable and was successfully discharged after restarting on warfarin.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?**: When faced with an oropharyngeal hemorrhage, emergency physicians may be compelled to secure and protect the airway. This could be achieved by planning several strategies. Nevertheless, in selected patients, and considering the circumstances, not addressing the airway is a reasonable and justifiable alternative.

### Maxillofacial and neck trauma: A damage control approach [^117FAGZt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Severe maxillofacial and neck trauma exposes patients to life-threatening complications such as airway compromise and hemorrhagic shock. These conditions require rapid actions in diagnosis and management, as well as a strong interplay between surgeons and anesthesiologists. Effective airway management often makes the difference between life and death in severe maxillofacial and neck trauma and takes initial precedence over all other clinical considerations.

- **Damage control strategies**: Focus on physiological and biochemical stabilization prior to the comprehensive anatomical and functional repair of all injuries. Damage control surgery (DCS) can be defined as the rapid initial control of hemorrhage and contamination, temporary wound closure, resuscitation to normal physiology in the intensive care unit (ICU), and subsequent re-exploration and definitive repair following restoration of normal physiology.

- **Damage control resuscitation (DCR)**: Consists mainly of hypotensive (permissive hypotension) and hemostatic (minimal use of crystalloid fluids and utilization of blood and blood products) resuscitation. Both strategies should be administered simultaneously in all of these patients.

### Perioperative considerations in management of the severely bleeding coagulopathic patient [^117GDDBX]. Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

- **Trauma-induced mortality**: Uncontrolled posttraumatic bleeding has been reported to cause 25% of all injury-related deaths and 40 to 80% of potentially preventable early traumatic deaths, with later mortality typically due to a hypercoagulable state and multiorgan failure. Trauma-induced coagulopathy describes a multifactorial coagulopathy arising from the interaction of hemorrhagic shock, tissue injury, and time from injury. It may manifest as hypocoagulability and evolve variably to contribute, along with metabolic acidosis and hypothermia, as a component of traumatic hemorrhage, forming the lethal triad.

- **Coagulopathy timeframes**: Early trauma-induced coagulopathy (less than 6 hours) is observed in massively hemorrhaging patients with shock due to poor hemostatic control and clot formation, compared to late trauma-induced coagulopathy (more than 24 hours), which is a hypercoagulable state leading to thromboses, acute lung injury, and multiorgan failure.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for developing or worsening trauma-induced coagulopathy include situational and patient-related factors such as older age, use of oral anticoagulants, severe tissue injury, penetrating trauma, traumatic brain injury, systemic shock and hypoperfusion, metabolic acidosis, long prehospital times, hypothermia, and dilutional crystalloid resuscitation fluids.

- **DIC distinction**: Notably, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is related to but distinct from trauma-induced coagulopathy. DIC reveals systemic, unbridled clotting often promoted by the expression of tissue factor on several cell surfaces, whereas in the early period of trauma-induced coagulopathy, tissue factor facilitates clot formation.

### Epistaxis: Outpatient management [^114zpvtu]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Epistaxis is a common emergency encountered by primary care physicians. Up to 60% of the general population experience epistaxis, and 6% seek medical attention for it. More than 90% of cases arise from the anterior nasal circulation, and most treatments can be easily performed in the outpatient setting. Evaluation of a patient presenting with epistaxis should begin with assessment of vital signs, mental status, and airway patency. When examining the nose, a nasal speculum and a good light source, such as a headlamp, can be useful. Compressive therapy is the first step to controlling anterior epistaxis. Oxymetazoline nasal spray or application of cotton soaked in oxymetazoline or epinephrine 1:1,000 may be useful adjuncts to compressive therapy. Directive nasal cautery, most commonly using silver nitrate, can be used to control localized continued bleeding or prominent vessels that are the suspected bleeding source. Finally, topical therapy and nasal packing can be used if other methods are unsuccessful. Compared with anterior epistaxis, posterior epistaxis is more likely to require hospitalization and twice as likely to need nasal packing. Posterior nasal packing is often associated with pain and a risk of aspiration if it is dislodged. After stabilization, patients with posterior packing often require referral to otolaryngology or the emergency department for definitive treatments.

### Interventions for treating post-extraction bleeding [^114ggLUk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Post-extraction bleeding (PEB) is a recognized, frequently encountered complication in dental practice, defined as bleeding that continues beyond 8 to 12 hours after dental extraction. The incidence of post-extraction bleeding varies from 0% to 26%. If not managed, complications can range from soft tissue hematomas to severe blood loss. Local causes of bleeding include soft tissue and bone bleeding, while systemic causes include platelet problems, coagulation disorders, excessive fibrinolysis, and inherited or acquired problems (medication induced). A wide array of techniques is suggested for the treatment of post-extraction bleeding, including interventions aimed at both local and systemic causes.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of interventions for treating different types of post-extraction bleeding.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following electronic databases: The Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 22 March 2016), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 2), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 22 March 2016), and CINAHL via EBSCO (1937 to 22 March 2016). Due to the ongoing Cochrane project to search EMBASE and add retrieved clinical trials to CENTRAL, we searched only the last 11 months of EMBASE via OVID (1 May 2015 to 22 March 2016). We placed no further restrictions on the language or date of publication. We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov), and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials.

### Airway obstruction in a man with warfarin-induced sublingual and pharyngeal haematomas [^114AFysp]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Existing guidelines emphasize a stepwise approach to difficult airway management. However, in cases of pharyngeal obstruction caused by a haematoma, it is advisable to proceed directly to a surgical airway.

- **Learning points**: Lingual, sublingual, and pharyngeal haematomas can complicate warfarin therapy. A multidisciplinary team of anesthetists, the ear, nose, and throat specialist, and emergency physicians should assess and make a predetermined decision on the best means of securing the airway in patients with airway haematoma. A surgical airway should be considered early in patients with an upper airway obstruction.

### Radiological diagnosis and management of epistaxis [^111SzBs1]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Haemorrhage from the nose is formally referred to as "epistaxis". Haemostasis within the nose can be compromised by mucosal abnormalities, vessel pathology, or coagulation disorders. The aetiology of epistaxis is divided into local and systemic factors. Local factors include trauma, local inflammatory reactions, foreign bodies, postsurgical anatomical deformities, intranasal tumours, chemical inhalants, nasal-prong oxygen administration, and continuous positive airway pressure therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea. Systemic causes of epistaxis include vascular disorders, especially hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT); blood dyscrasias; hematologic malignancies; and drugs affecting the normal clotting mechanism.

Epistaxis arising from the anterior septal area (anterior epistaxis) is more common in children and young adults. It is the most common type of epistaxis and is more often venous in origin. This condition is usually responsive to treatment because it is readily accessible for nasal packing if bleeding does not resolve spontaneously; therefore, endovascular therapy is usually not indicated for anterior epistaxis.

Approximately 5% of epistaxis episodes arise from the posterior and superior portions of the nasal cavity, and the majority of posterior epistaxis episodes arise from the arteries of the septum. Posterior epistaxis is more common in older patients than in children. The most common factors associated with posterior epistaxis include hypertension and the use of acetylsalicylic acid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

### Demographic differences in emergency room epistaxis treatment patterns and outcomes [^116toELg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Epistaxis is one of the most common otolaryngologic complaints in the United States, with up to 60% of the US population experiencing at least one episode in their lifetime. However, only about 6% seek medical treatment, with even fewer requiring admission to the hospital. Treatment for epistaxis is highly variable and usually influenced by the etiology and patient comorbidities. Clinical guidelines have been created to standardize care in an attempt to optimize patient outcomes while minimizing unnecessary treatments. Traditionally, epistaxis is initially treated conservatively with nasal pressure and a nasal decongestant spray.

Subsequent stepwise escalation of treatment consists of nasal packing, cautery, and ultimately surgery or embolization. Recommendations have been delineated based on the anatomic origin of the bleed. Anterior epistaxis is managed by applying pressure to the nostrils, silver nitrate cauterization, or anterior nasal packing, while posterior bleeds generally require nasal packing or endoscopic surgical procedures. Cauterization has been shown to be the most effective at controlling anterior bleeds with an 80% success rate, while posterior bleeds are best controlled with endoscopic surgery, achieving a 97% success rate.

Disparities exist in the demographics of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) for epistaxis. These patients tend to be male, older, non-Caucasian, and have a lower socioeconomic status. A study of the pediatric population revealed that children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds comprised a higher proportion of…

### Maxillofacial and neck trauma: A damage control approach [^114iQrVp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Severe maxillofacial and neck trauma exposes patients to life-threatening complications such as airway compromise and hemorrhagic shock. These conditions require rapid recognition and management, as well as a strong interplay between surgeons, anesthesiologists, and other relevant medical personnel. Hemorrhage is one of the leading causes of death following trauma. After the initial insult, the combined occurrence of coagulopathy, hypothermia, and acidosis ("the lethal triad") further contributes to the poor prognosis of severely exsanguinating trauma patients.

Over the last years, new strategies termed DCS (Damage Control Surgery) and DCR (Damage Control Resuscitation) have gained popularity in the management of injured patients. Damage control strategies focus on physiological and biochemical stabilization prior to the comprehensive anatomical and functional repair of all injuries. DCS can be defined as the rapid initial control of hemorrhage and contamination, temporary wound closure, resuscitation to normal physiology in the ICU, and subsequent re-exploration and definitive repair following the restoration of normal physiology.

DCR, defined as nonsurgical strategies utilized to prevent or reverse the effects and outcomes of the "lethal triad", consists mainly of hypotensive (permissive hypotension) and hemostatic (minimal use of crystalloid fluids and utilization of blood and blood products) resuscitation. DCR and DCS should be administered simultaneously with close collaboration between all medical personnel involved in the patient's treatment.

### Treatment of bleeding upper aerodigestive tract tumor-a novel approach with antifibrinolytic agent: Case series and literature review [^117Azzz3]. The Laryngoscope (2013). Low credibility.

Symptomatic bleeding among patients with advanced upper aerodigestive tract tumor presents a significant challenge. Given the limited options for topical treatment, embolization is often required to control the hemorrhage. Recent cases have reported novel and successful treatment of patients with recalcitrant tracheo-bronchial bleeds using tranexamic acid. Consequently, we describe our initial experience with four consecutive cases of patients with bleeding from advanced aerodigestive tract tumors, successfully treated with oral tranexamic acid.

- **Study design**: A case series.

- **Methods**: Four consecutive patients with acute bleeding from upper aerodigestive tract tumors were treated with oral tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid was administered both topically and systemically (1 gm PO QID) for cases involving oropharyngeal and supraglottic tumors, whereas systemic-only therapy was provided to patients with nasal and nasopharyngeal tumors.

- **Results**: None of the patients experienced further bleeding following the commencement of tranexamic acid treatment, and no adverse effects were noted. These cases are the first reported instances of symptomatic upper aerodigestive hemorrhage being controlled with tranexamic acid. It is increasingly being employed for life-threatening bleeding following trauma and major surgery. The optimum dose of tranexamic acid remains undetermined; however, in vivo studies suggest concentrations of 10 μg/mL to 16 μg/mL are optimal for anti-fibrinolytic effect, which is achievable with a 1 gm QID oral administration.

### A critical review of the literature and an evidence-based approach for life-threatening hemorrhage in maxillofacial surgery [^11325iaR]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Life-threatening facial hemorrhage in maxillofacial surgery (MFS) has an approximate incidence of 1% in both trauma patients and elective surgeries. The treatment of acute life-threatening hemorrhage in MFS aims to prevent hypovolemic shock or airway obstruction. This forms the cornerstone of emergency care and highlights the need for further analysis given the multitude of treatment options proposed. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken to formulate an evidence-based approach to the treatment of life-threatening hemorrhage in MFS.

- **Materials and methods**: A comprehensive search of journal articles was performed using PubMed and Ovid databases. Keywords and phrases utilized included "life threatening facial hemorrhage", "life threatening facial bleeding", "external carotid artery ligation", and "external carotid artery embolization". Our search yielded 1,441 articles. To focus exclusively on hemorrhage from traumatic and operative events, articles that cited hematological disorders as the underlying cause of bleeding were excluded. Forty articles met the full inclusion criteria and form the basis of this systematic review. The articles were rated based on the level of evidence, resulting in 1 Level II, 21 Level III, 12 Level IV, and 6 Level V papers.

- **Result**: Seven Level III evidence-based studies noted a high association between midface injuries, particularly Lefort III fractures, and massive oronasal hemorrhage. One Level II study, 8 Level III studies, and 3 Level IV studies concluded that the internal maxillary artery was most frequently involved in.

### Maxillofacial and neck trauma: A damage control approach [^111E1Ghj]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Vascular injury is noted in 20% of cases of penetrating neck trauma, with exsanguinating hemorrhage being the primary cause of death in such cases. Life-threatening facial hemorrhage in maxillofacial surgery has an approximate incidence of 1% in trauma patients. Conservative measures, such as anterior and posterior nasal packing, are recommended as the first attempt to control traumatic midface hemorrhage. Temporary reduction of facial fractures is also effective in controlling massive facial hemorrhage.

Zone II neck injuries with hard signs of vascular injury require immediate surgical exploration. Vascular injuries in Zone II mandate a high index of suspicion for tracheal and esophageal injuries. Suspected proximal (Zone I) carotid injuries require partial sternotomy for proximal control. Injuries to the common or internal carotid arteries may be repaired using lateral arteriography, patch angioplasty, end-to-end anastomosis, or bypass. If the patient is in extremis, the common or internal carotid vessels may be ligated. This approach leads to dismal outcomes, with stroke rates exceeding 20% and mortality approaching 50%. An alternative to ligation would be the placement of a temporary shunt between the two ends.

In the case of distal internal carotid (Zone III) injury, ligation is appropriate if the distal end can also be ligated. If the distal end is within the skull base, a size 3 Fogarty embolectomy catheter can be used to occlude the distal end, allowing it to thrombose. Embolization of the bleeding vessel was also recommended as the most reliable method.

### Enskyce [^114cUvjW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Additional instructions for all dosing regimens**: Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In cases of breakthrough bleeding, nonfunctional causes should be considered, as with all instances of irregular vaginal bleeding. For undiagnosed persistent or abnormal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are necessary to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology is excluded, time or switching to a different formulation may resolve the issue. However, changing to an oral contraceptive with a higher estrogen content should only be done if necessary, as it may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease.

- **Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period**: If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period, and oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.

### Treatment of bleeding in patients with liver disease [^113X1GSC]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

A 60‐year‐old woman with decompensated cirrhosis related to chronic hepatitis C infection is under evaluation for liver transplantation. She has extensive dental caries and, prior to transplantation, needs multiple tooth extractions. She has no history of excessive spontaneous or surgical bleeding and tolerated dental work prior to the onset of her cirrhosis without complications. She has CTP C cirrhosis, MELD 24, with ascites and intermittent hepatic encephalopathy. Her PT is 23 seconds, INR is 1.9, and platelet count is 41,000/µl. Following multidisciplinary discussion, the dental extractions are performed without hemostatic support. There is no intra-operative excess bleeding; however, she returns the following day with persistent oozing from an open socket.

Dental decay is a potential source of infection post liver transplantation. Formal dental evaluation (and extractions where necessary) are therefore recommended as part of the liver transplantation work-up. The prevalence of periodontal disease in this group is reported to be as high as 75%.

Procedural bleeding risk can be classified as high or low based on the estimated incidence of major bleeding and its potential consequences. By definition, a low bleeding risk procedure carries a major bleeding risk of 1.5% and/or where bleeding, in its event, would be difficult to control (e.g. non-compressible site) and/or of significant consequence (e.g. intracranial bleeding).

### Ojemda [^111o5N8V]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hemorrhage**: Hemorrhage, including major hemorrhage defined as symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, can occur with OJEMDA. In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], hemorrhagic events occurred in 37% of patients, including epistaxis in 26% and intratumoral hemorrhage in 9%. Serious events of bleeding occurred in 5% of patients, including Grade 5 tumor hemorrhage in 1 patient (0.6%). OJEMDA was permanently discontinued for hemorrhage in 2% of patients. Advise patients and caregivers of the risk of hemorrhage during treatment with OJEMDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hemorrhage and evaluate as clinically indicated. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon improvement, or permanently discontinue based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

- **Skin toxicity including photosensitivity**: OJEMDA can cause rash, including maculopapular rash and photosensitivity. In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], rash occurred in 67% of patients treated with OJEMDA, including Grade 3 rash in 12%. Rash resulted in dose interruption in 15% of patients and dose reduction in 7% of patients. OJEMDA was permanently discontinued due to rash in 1% of patients. In the pooled safety population, dermatitis acneiform occurred in 26% of patients treated with OJEMDA, including Grade 3 dermatitis acneiform in 0.6% of patients. Dose reduction was required in 2% of patients due to dermatitis acneiform. Monitor for new or worsening skin reactions. Consider dermatologic consultation and initiate supportive care as clinically indicated.

### Complications with use of the Epistat in the arrest of midfacial haemorrhage [^112UiR2e]. Injury (2003). Low credibility.

Control of midfacial haemorrhage can be difficult, especially in the multiply injured patient, either at the scene of injury or in the Accident and Emergency Department. The use of Epistats has proven invaluable in this setting. Potential problems exist with their use, and this is illustrated with examples, together with strategies for overcoming them.

- **Method of safe use**: Insert the Epistat, aiming for a fingertip placed at the soft palate. Inflate the posterior cuff, then withdraw the Epistat slightly to position the posterior cuff within the nasal choanae. Finally, inflate the anterior (intranasal) cuff.

### An alternative to a postnasal pack for the arrest of perioperative hemorrhage following curettage adenoidectomy [^115mhJRj]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Controlling bleeding with standard postnasal packing following curettage adenoidectomy is only occasionally warranted. Children find the packing experience unpleasant, and removal of the packing usually requires general anesthesia. We describe a simple technique for packing the nasopharynx with bilateral nasal tampons via an anterior approach. The tampons are much easier to insert than standard packing, they are well tolerated while in place, and they can be easily removed with perhaps only some light sedation rather than general anesthesia.

### Interventions for treating post-extraction bleeding [^114poSzs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Post-extraction bleeding (PEB) is a recognized, frequently encountered complication in dental practice, defined as bleeding that continues beyond 8 to 12 hours after dental extraction. The incidence of post-extraction bleeding varies from 0% to 26%. If post-extraction bleeding is not managed, complications can range from soft tissue hematomas to severe blood loss. Local causes of bleeding include soft tissue and bone bleeding, while systemic causes include platelet problems, coagulation disorders or excessive fibrinolysis, and inherited or acquired problems (medication induced). A wide array of techniques has been suggested for the treatment of post-extraction bleeding, addressing both local and systemic causes. This document is an update of a review published in June 2016.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of interventions for treating different types of post-extraction bleeding.

- **Search methods**: Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched various databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (up to 24 January 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2017, Issue 12), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 24 January 2018), Embase Ovid (1 May 2015 to 24 January 2018), and CINAHL EBSCO (1937 to 24 January 2018). The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. We also searched the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews.

### Women and bleeding disorders: Diagnostic challenges [^114vdQTn]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2020). Low credibility.

Women with bleeding disorders suffer from multiple bleeding symptoms, including easy bruising, epistaxis, bleeding from minor wounds and the oral cavity, and bleeding after dental work or surgery. However, women with bleeding disorders especially suffer from gynecologic and obstetrical bleeding. These symptoms often are not recognized as abnormal, and many women are left undiagnosed and without access to appropriate medical care.

Additional challenges to diagnosing women with bleeding disorders include lack of access to appropriate laboratory testing and issues around disease classification and nomenclature. Efforts have been undertaken to address these challenges, including the development and validation of bleeding assessment tools and strategies to clarify diagnostic thresholds and algorithms for von Willebrand disease (VWD) and platelet function disorders. Efforts to improve communication with the nomenclature used for hemophilia carriers are also underway.

### Diagnostic dilemma: our experience with necrotising sialometaplasia [^115EY6N7]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

A man in his 40s presented to our outpatient department with a painful ulcer in the oral cavity for one week. After an intraoral examination, a single hard palate ulcer, which was non-tender on palpation, was noted. Baseline blood investigations such as haemogram and serological evaluation were within normal limits. Under local anaesthesia, an excisional biopsy was performed. The histopathological examination revealed a reactive necrotising inflammatory process involving minor salivary glands with no cytological atypia. Weekly follow-up was performed, and at the end of four weeks, complete healing of the lesion occurred without any further intervention.

### Maxillofacial and neck trauma: A damage control approach [^115YrNaU]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Severe maxillofacial and neck trauma exposes patients to life-threatening complications such as airway compromise and hemorrhagic shock. These conditions require rapid actions, including diagnosis and management, and a strong interplay between surgeons and anesthesiologists. Effective airway management often determines life or death outcomes in severe maxillofacial and neck trauma and takes precedence over all other clinical considerations.

- **Damage control strategies**: Focus on physiological and biochemical stabilization before the comprehensive anatomical and functional repair of all injuries. Damage control surgery (DCS) is defined as the rapid initial control of hemorrhage and contamination, temporary wound closure, resuscitation to normal physiology in the intensive care unit (ICU), and subsequent re-exploration and definitive repair following restoration of normal physiology.

- **Damage control resuscitation (DCR)**: Consists mainly of hypotensive (permissive hypotension) and hemostatic resuscitation, which involves the minimal use of crystalloid fluids and the utilization of blood and blood products. Both strategies should be administered simultaneously to all of these patients.

### Maxillofacial trauma patient: coping with the difficult airway [^111bneLL]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Immediate management of maxillofacial injuries is required mainly when there is an impending or existing upper airway compromise and/or profuse hemorrhage occurs. Hutchinson et al. addressed six specific situations associated with maxillofacial trauma, which may adversely affect the airway:

1. Posteroinferior displacement of a fractured maxilla parallel to the inclined plane of the skull base may block the nasopharyngeal airway.

2. A bilateral fracture of the anterior mandible may cause the fractured symphysis to slide posteriorly along with the tongue, which is attached to it via its anterior insertion. In the supine patient, the base of the tongue may drop back, thus blocking the oropharynx.

3. Fractured or exfoliated teeth, bone fragments, vomitus, and blood, as well as foreign bodies such as dentures, debris, and shrapnel, may block the airway anywhere along the upper aerodigestive tract.

4. Hemorrhage, either from distinct vessels in open wounds or severe nasal bleeding from the complex blood supply of the nose, may also contribute to airway obstruction.

These situations should be addressed immediately using various manual and/or instrumental techniques, in accordance with the "A" step in the ABC treatment protocol suggested by the ATLS. Endotracheal intubation should be considered if it was not performed earlier.

5. Soft tissue swelling and edema resulting from trauma to the head and neck may cause delayed airway compromise.

6. Trauma to the larynx and trachea may cause swelling and displacement of structures, such as the epiglottis and arytenoid cartilage.

### Life-threatening bleeding in a facial fracture [^112dMWsG]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Life-threatening bleeding in facial fractures is considered rare, and most reports do not provide a precise treatment guideline. Although various methods have been suggested, their efficacy is unpredictable and may lead to irreversible shock. To prevent irreversible shock, early detection and effective treatment are mandatory.

A case is reported of a patient who presented with a complex midface fracture after falling on June 23, 1999. Life-threatening oronasal bleeding developed one hour after arriving at the emergency room. Initial nasal packing failed to stop the nasal bleeding. After resuscitation, the patient's vital signs stabilized, but bleeding persisted. Angiography showed diffuse extravasation of contrast medium over the territory of the right internal maxillary artery. Embolization was performed successfully to stop the bleeding.

The authors review the literature regarding the incidence, diagnosis, and treatment of life-threatening facial fractures. In the literature, the lack of a precise definition leads to varied results from different treatments. The authors have formulated a succinct treatment guideline, favoring angiographic embolization as the first choice of treatment when tight nasal and/or oral packing fails.

### Epistaxis: Diagnosis and treatment [^112LyZRD]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Oral and maxillofacial surgeons are often called upon to evaluate and treat various emergencies, including acute epistaxis. Although epistaxis is relatively benign, it can lead to serious and life-threatening situations. It is estimated that up to 60% of the population experiences at least one episode of epistaxis in their lifetime. Of this group, 6% seek medical care, and 1.6 in 10,000 require hospitalization.

With a decreasing number of otorhinolaryngologists available on hospital call schedules, it is critical for oral and maxillofacial surgeons to be familiar with the anatomy, diagnosis, and treatment of acute epistaxis and its associated medical concerns. Considerations involving the mechanism of injury, coagulopathies, and potential treatment options need to be assessed quickly and accurately to ensure the most appropriate treatment and positive outcome for the patient.

The management of epistaxis in an emergency setting often requires the expertise of an oral and maxillofacial surgeon. By reviewing the anatomy, understanding potential complications arising from associated medical conditions, and exploring treatment options, patients can be assessed accurately and treated appropriately.

### Japanese clinical practice guidelines for vascular anomalies 2017 [^115EVkAC]. The Journal of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Symptoms**: A wide variety of symptoms have been reported depending on the site of the mass, including tongue discomfort, bleeding, pain, and difficulty in oral feeding. Roy et al. reported that bleeding from the tongue surface, pain, and eating difficulty were alleviated by cauterization.

- **Functions**: In most patients who exhibited functional impairment, the lesions were so extended that they were no longer indications for one-time surgical resection. Large masses located at sites such as the tongue base cause respiratory disturbances, swallowing disorders, and difficulty in speech. According to the report by Azizkhan et al, oral intake of normally cooked food became possible in 14, and normal vocalization became possible in eight, of the 21 patients with tongue base lesions. In addition, five of the 17 patients who needed tracheotomy were weaned.

- **Cosmetic improvements**: Objective evaluation of cosmetic effects is also difficult. Azizkhan et al. reported that, of the 20 patients, excluding one with severe deformity who died, deformity of structures around the tongue, such as the mandible and maxilla, was mild in six, moderate in five, and severe in nine. There have been a few reports that cosmetic improvements were also observed in patients who showed a reduction of the tongue size by surgical resection, but objective evaluation is insufficient.

- **Complications**: Although the properties of the lesions are unclear in some papers, facial nerve paralysis, vagus nerve paralysis, infection, hematoma, seroma, salivary leakage, ruptured suture, and skin failure have been reported.
