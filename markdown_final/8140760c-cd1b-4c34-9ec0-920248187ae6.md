## Question

What kinds of diets worsen h pylori infections

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what kinds of diets or dietary patterns worsen Helicobacter pylori infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "worsening" means clinically and biologically for H. pylori. Then, I should evaluate the strongest mechanistic evidence, especially high-salt exposure and CagA regulation. Next, I will assess dietary factors that impair eradication outcomes. After that, I should consider epidemiologic links between certain foods and disease severity or carcinogenesis, and behaviors that facilitate transmission. Finally, I will synthesize a hierarchy of risk and translate this into practical guidance consistent with current H. pylori management guidelines, while verifying the quality and limitations of the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm what constitutes "worsening" of H. pylori infection in a clinically meaningful way. I need to ensure I cover increased bacterial virulence and colonization, aggravated mucosal injury and gastritis, acceleration toward atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, or cancer, reduced antibiotic eradication efficacy, and higher transmission risk within households or communities, since these domains reflect both patient-level pathophysiology and public health impact.

> Wait, let me verify the most robust mechanistic signal in the dietary literature: high dietary salt. In vivo gerbil studies show that a high-salt diet combined with cagA-positive H. pylori drove 100% gastric adenocarcinoma, versus 58% on regular salt, alongside more severe inflammation, higher gastric pH, and upregulated mucosal IL-1β, indicating both enhanced bacterial virulence and a more permissive gastric environment for carcinogenesis [^112p4ixu]. In vitro and in vivo, salt upregulates H. pylori cagA transcription and increases CagA delivery and IL-8 induction in epithelial cells, mechanistically linking salt to pro-inflammatory signaling and oncoprotein activity [^1148tY6R] [^115Srw7k]. Hold on, I should also verify whether salt exposure selects for adaptive bacterial variants; indeed, selection for a fur R88H variant that enhances oxidative stress resistance under high salt has been demonstrated, with enrichment in strains from patients with premalignant lesions, supporting diet-driven pathogen adaptation in carcinogenic microenvironments [^113kvKVt] [^114ZSq6u].

> I need to check whether these salt findings translate to people. Although human randomized data are lacking, convergent reviews indicate high salt disrupts the gastric mucosal barrier, facilitates H. pylori colonization, and synergizes with other carcinogens, which plausibly worsens the infection's clinical trajectory toward cancer, especially in cagA-positive contexts and with hypochlorhydria that can emerge in corpus-predominant gastritis or atrophy [^111wej2x] [^1169oqgP].

> Next, I should review dietary factors that impair eradication therapy. A Japanese cohort undergoing standard triple therapy found higher dietary cholesterol and egg intake were associated with treatment failure, and, paradoxically, higher omega-3 fatty acid intake was also linked to lower eradication success, suggesting diet-lipid–bacterial membrane or host immune interactions might modulate antibiotic efficacy, although causality and mechanism need confirmation [^113sCiRe]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; this is observational and regimen-specific, but given guidelines emphasize minimizing factors that contribute to failure because success rates drop with each attempt, it is reasonable to consider moderating these exposures during therapy while prioritizing optimized, region-appropriate regimens and adherence counseling [^114HuxWv].

> I will now examine broader dietary patterns associated with more severe disease phenotypes or carcinogenesis in the setting of H. pylori. Processed and red meats and other processed foods that yield N-nitroso compounds can damage gastric epithelium and appear to synergize with H. pylori to induce neoplasia in primates, whereas either exposure alone did not induce comparable precancerous lesions over time, which argues for a diet–pathogen interaction model of gastric carcinogenesis [^115QkNFt]. Reviews consistently implicate high dietary fat, alcohol, and cholesterol as risk enhancers for gastric carcinogenesis, aligning with the concept that pro-inflammatory and mucosa-injuring diets potentiate H. pylori–driven injury and malignant transformation, although effect sizes and confounding vary across populations [^111HPWJn].

> But wait, what about refined grains and other staples. I should double-check epidemiologic links to infection prevalence and severity. A recent analysis found refined grain intake was associated with higher H. pylori infection prevalence, possibly reflecting diet–host metabolic–immune interactions, though the cross-sectional design limits causal inference, and confounding by socioeconomic and hygiene factors is likely, so I need to be cautious in attributing direct pathogenic effects here [^111HPWJn]. Interestingly, the same work suggested higher fruit intake correlated with positivity, which contradicts many protective-diet narratives; however, raw produce can act as a transmission vehicle when contaminated, which reframes this as a hygiene and food safety issue rather than inherent dietary harm from fruits per se [^1159hSwZ].

> Next, I should review dietary behaviors that facilitate transmission, because while they don't exacerbate bacterial virulence directly, they increase acquisition and household clustering, which worsens population burden. Large-scale family-based data show strong intrafamilial transmission, with behavioral modifiers such as using serving utensils lowering infection rates, and practices like feeding chewed food or shared dishes increasing risk, underscoring that communal eating habits can materially affect spread dynamics even after accounting for socioeconomic context [^111prBvN].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I began sketching a "Hierarchy of evidence strength: Diet… " but that was incomplete. Let me reconsider and prioritize clearly. The most coherent mechanistic and translational signal is high salt, with multi-tier evidence from gene regulation to carcinogenesis in vivo, so salt reduction is a high-priority recommendation in H. pylori–infected individuals, especially those with cagA-positive strains or corpus-predominant gastritis where atrophy risk is high [^112p4ixu] [^1148tY6R] [^115Srw7k] [^1158xZLx]. Processed meats and nitrosamine exposure likely act synergistically with H. pylori to promote neoplasia and should be minimized, with supportive animal and epidemiological data, albeit with the usual confounding caveats [^115QkNFt] [^111HPWJn]. Diet-lipid effects on eradication success, including cholesterol, eggs, and omega-3s, warrant a pragmatic, time-limited moderation during therapy given the potential to impair cure, recognizing the evidence is observational and regimen-specific and should not distract from optimizing antibiotics and adherence [^113sCiRe] [^114HuxWv]. Transmission-modifying behaviors like dedicated serving utensils and safe handling of raw produce are sensible preventive measures in households with infection [^111prBvN] [^1159hSwZ].

> I should confirm practical clinical guidance that aligns with standards of care. Eradication therapy is the intervention with proven benefit on symptoms and long-term cancer prevention, so diet is an adjunct, not a substitute; test-and-treat should be followed by effective first-line regimens such as bismuth quadruple or concomitant therapy tailored to local resistance, with attention to adherence and retreatment strategy if needed, while recognizing that adjunctive probiotics are not currently recommended to boost efficacy due to insufficient evidence [^111BpyUH] [^1162qAAE] [^116ZZLBX]. I need to ensure that for cancer prevention, particularly in high-risk regions or patients with atrophic gastritis, eradication reduces incident gastric cancer at the population level, with guideline endorsements to treat H. pylori in patients at risk and to reduce progression in atrophic gastritis, which frames dietary risk modification as a complementary strategy to the primary objective of cure [^113b8PRA] [^111yg7V4] [^111X1Qkt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about every nutrient. I almost said omega-3 intake improves eradication given its anti-inflammatory profile, but the Japanese data actually associated higher omega-3 with eradication failure, so until mechanistic clarity emerges, it is reasonable to avoid high-dose supplemental omega-3s during the antibiotic week and early follow-up while focusing on pharmacologic optimization and salt and processed-meat reduction, then resume heart-healthy patterns thereafter if clinically indicated for cardiovascular reasons, balancing risks and benefits in shared decision-making [^113sCiRe] [^114HuxWv].

> Putting this together, my prioritized, pragmatic advice is: reduce dietary salt substantially; minimize processed and red meats and nitrosamine-rich processed foods; limit alcohol and very high-fat dietary patterns that irritate the mucosa; consider moderating high-cholesterol and egg intake during the eradication window; practice strict food hygiene with raw produce and use serving utensils in shared meals to lower transmission risk, all while ensuring evidence-based eradication therapy and follow-up testing for cure, because eradication is what most clearly changes prognosis and cancer risk over time [^111HPWJn] [^113sCiRe] [^111prBvN] [^111BpyUH] [^113b8PRA].

> Finally, I should acknowledge limitations. Much of the diet–H. pylori literature is observational, region-specific, or based on animal and in vitro models, with potential confounding by socioeconomic status, sanitation, and concurrent medications, so individualization is essential and diet should complement, not replace, guideline-based eradication and risk stratification by gastritis phenotype and atrophy burden, with ongoing need for higher-quality trials to refine diet recommendations in this context [^111HPWJn] [^1158xZLx] [^114HuxWv].

Diets high in **salt and processed meats** [^112p4ixu] [^111HPWJn] worsen H. pylori infections by increasing bacterial virulence [^1148tY6R], gastric inflammation, and cancer risk. High-salt intake upregulates **cagA expression** [^1148tY6R] [^115Srw7k] and promotes gastric inflammation and carcinogenesis [^112p4ixu]. Processed meats and nitrite-rich foods increase N-nitroso compounds [^111HPWJn], compounding mucosal injury and cancer risk [^115QkNFt].

High-fat, high-cholesterol, and refined carbohydrate diets [^111HPWJn] exacerbate inflammation [^1147gi93], impair immunity, and reduce eradication success [^113sCiRe]. Alcohol and smoking [^116WieX5] further increase **mucosal damage** and cancer risk [^111HPWJn]. These dietary patterns collectively worsen H. pylori–related disease and hinder eradication.

## High-salt diets

High-salt diets are strongly associated with more severe **H. pylori infection** [^112p4ixu] and related complications. High salt intake exacerbates gastric inflammation, increases bacterial virulence [^1148tY6R], and raises gastric cancer risk [^111HPWJn].

- **Increased bacterial virulence**: High salt intake upregulates the expression of H. pylori virulence genes, particularly cagA [^1148tY6R] [^115Srw7k], which is associated with increased inflammation and carcinogenesis [^112p4ixu].

- **Gastric inflammation and carcinogenesis**: Animal studies have demonstrated that high-salt diets significantly increase gastric inflammation [^112p4ixu], parietal cell loss, and the incidence of gastric adenocarcinoma in H. pylori-infected models.

- **Genetic adaptation**: High-salt environments select for H. pylori strains with enhanced resistance to oxidative stress and increased virulence, further exacerbating infection severity [^114ZSq6u] [^1164X4Ui].

---

## Processed meats and nitrite-rich foods

Processed meats and nitrite-rich foods significantly worsen **H. pylori infections** by increasing the formation of carcinogenic **N-nitroso compounds** [^111HPWJn], which damage the gastric mucosa and elevate cancer risk [^115QkNFt]. These diets are associated with an **increased cancer risk** [^112tjUJQ], particularly in the presence of H. pylori infection [^111HPWJn].

---

## High-fat and high-cholesterol diets

Diets rich in **saturated fats** and cholesterol exacerbate H. pylori infections by promoting **inflammation and immune impairment** [^1147gi93] and reducing eradication effectiveness. High-fat intake increases gastric inflammation and facilitates H. pylori colonization and persistence, while high dietary cholesterol is linked to **reduced eradication success**, correlating with lower success rates of H. pylori eradication therapy [^113sCiRe].

---

## Refined carbohydrates and sugars

Diets high in **refined carbohydrates and sugars** [^111wej2x] worsen H. pylori infections by promoting **bacterial growth**, increasing inflammation [^1147gi93], and impairing immune function. Readily available carbohydrates provide energy for H. pylori, while high sugar intake increases gastric inflammation and leads to **inflammation and immune impairment**, exacerbating infection severity.

---

## Alcohol and smoking

Alcohol consumption and smoking [^116WieX5] significantly worsen **H. pylori infections** by increasing **gastric mucosal damage**, inflammation, and cancer risk [^111HPWJn]. These lifestyle factors are associated with an **increased cancer risk**, particularly in the presence of H. pylori infection [^111HPWJn].

### High dietary salt intake exacerbates Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric carcinogenesis [^112p4ixu]. Infection and Immunity (2013). Low credibility.

Persistent colonization of the human stomach with *Helicobacter pylori* is a risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma, and *H. pylori*-induced carcinogenesis is dependent on the actions of a bacterial oncoprotein known as CagA. Epidemiological studies have shown that high dietary salt intake is also a risk factor for gastric cancer. To investigate the effects of a high-salt diet, we infected Mongolian gerbils with a wild-type (WT) *cagA(+)* *H. pylori* strain or an isogenic *cagA* mutant strain and maintained the animals on a regular diet or a high-salt diet.

At 4 months post-infection, gastric adenocarcinoma was detected in 100% of the WT-infected/high-salt-diet animals, 58% of WT-infected/regular-diet animals, and none of the animals infected with the *cagA* mutant strain (P < 0.0001). Among animals infected with the WT strain, those fed a high-salt diet had more severe gastric inflammation, higher gastric pH, increased parietal cell loss, increased gastric expression of interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and decreased gastric expression of hepcidin and hydrogen potassium ATPase (H, K-ATPase) compared to those on a regular diet.

Previous studies have detected upregulation of CagA synthesis in response to increased salt concentrations in the bacterial culture medium, and concordant with the in vitro results, we detected increased *cagA* transcription in vivo in animals fed a high-salt diet compared to those on a regular diet. Animals infected with the *cagA* mutant strain had low levels of gastric inflammation and did not develop hypochlorhydria. These results indicate that a high-salt diet potentiates gastric carcinogenesis in the presence of *H. pylori*.

### Diet and carcinogenesis of gastric cancer [^111HPWJn]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Several recent studies have corroborated a strong association between diet and gastric cancer risk; investigators have also identified dietary factors that protect against gastric cancer. This review summarizes the literature on this topic and guides future research directions.

- **Recent findings**: High-salt intake disrupts the gastric mucosal defense barrier, promoting Helicobacter pylori colonization and penetration of other carcinogenic compounds. Processed foods, processed meats, red meat, alcohol, foods with high dietary fat, and dietary cholesterol increase the risk of gastric carcinogenesis. On the other hand, increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and a low-salt diet may offer a protective effect.

- **Summary**: Despite decreases in gastric cancer incidence because of increased identification and treatment of H. pylori, gastric cancer remains one of the most common cancers worldwide with a high mortality rate. This disturbing statistic highlights the importance of reducing and eliminating other risk factors for gastric cancer. There is a strong body of evidence that alcohol, processed foods, high salt intake, high fat intake, and foods with animal products (meats, eggs, and dairy) increase the risk of gastric cancer. A diet that is high in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and is low in salt may reduce the risk of gastric cancer.

### Higher dietary cholesterol and ω-3 fatty acid intakes are associated with a lower success rate of eradication therapy in Japan [^113sCiRe]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection is a known risk factor for duodenal ulcers, gastritis, and gastric cancer. The eradication of H. pylori is successful in treating these disorders; however, the success rate of eradication therapy is declining. There may be an interaction with nutrient intake to account for this decline.

- **Objective**: We investigated the influence of food and nutrient intake on H. pylori eradication therapy.
- **Design**: In this study, 4,014 subjects underwent endoscopy, were tested for serum antibodies to H. pylori (2,046 positive; 51.0%), and had their food intake assessed with the use of a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Of the positive subjects, endoscopies showed that 389 (19.0%) had gastritis and/or duodenal ulcers and were also positive for a ¹³C-urea breath test (UBT). These 389 subjects received one-week H. pylori eradication therapy with lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin and a second UBT eight weeks after treatment. Complete demographic characteristics, serum lipid, insulin, glycated hemoglobin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and creatinine concentrations as well as complete FFQs were available for 352 subjects.
- **Results**: The success rate of eradication therapy was 60.4% (235 of 389). Factors associated with the failure of eradication therapy included increased age (P = 0.02), higher CRP concentrations (P < 0.01), higher dietary cholesterol (P < 0.01) or egg intake (P < 0.01), and higher ω-3 (n-3) fatty acid intake.

### Regulation of Helicobacter pylori cagA expression in response to salt [^1148tY6R]. Cancer Research (2007). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection and a high dietary salt intake are risk factors for the development of gastric adenocarcinoma. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that high salt concentrations might alter gene expression in H. pylori. Transcriptional profiling experiments indicated that the expression of multiple H. pylori genes, including cagA, was regulated in response to the concentrations of sodium chloride present in the bacterial culture medium. Increased expression of cagA in response to high salt conditions was confirmed by the use of transcriptional reporter strains and by immunoblotting. H. pylori CagA is translocated into gastric epithelial cells via a type IV secretion pathway, and on entry into target cells, CagA undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and causes multiple cellular alterations. Coculture of gastric epithelial cells with H. pylori grown under high salt conditions resulted in increased tyrosine-phosphorylated CagA and increased secretion of interleukin-8 by the epithelial cells compared with coculture of the cells with H. pylori grown under low salt conditions. Up-regulation of H. pylori cagA expression in response to high salt concentrations may be a factor that contributes to the development of gastric adenocarcinoma.

### Effect of lifestyle, smoking, and diet on development of intestinal metaplasia in H. pylori-positive subjects [^116WieX5]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of environmental and sociodemographic factors and the effect of smoking, alcohol, and dietary habits on the risk of gastric intestinal metaplasia (IM) in Helicobacter pylori-infected subjects.

The investigation was based on 2598 consecutive volunteer blood donors tested for the presence of antibodies against H. pylori from March 1995 to March 1997. Endoscopy with multiple biopsies was offered to all H. pylori-positive, symptomatic subjects. The presence or absence of IM was diagnosed by gastric biopsies. A serologically H. pylori-positive subject with gastric IM was defined as a case, whereas serologically H. pylori-positive subjects without IM were used as controls. All patients answered a detailed questionnaire collecting sociodemographic characteristics and smoking, alcohol drinking, and dietary habits. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% CIs were estimated by unconditional logistic regression, including terms for age and sex, to assess the association between the data collected and IM.

Three hundred forty-four subjects with serological H. pylori infection and upper-GI symptoms underwent GI endoscopy, during which biopsies were taken for histological diagnosis. Histology revealed metaplasia in 74 subjects (21.5%). Incomplete IM was found in 37.8% of these cases. No significant associations were found between IM and anthropometric or sociodemographic factors. There was a significant association between age and IM (χ² for trend, 6.67; p value, 0.009). Smokers of over 20 cigarettes per day had a significant impact on the development of IM.

### Large-scale, national, family-based epidemiological study on infection in China: The time to change practice for related disease prevention [^117R7Aif]. Gut (2023). High credibility.

Previously scattered small studies have investigated the relationship between household member H. pylori infection and various lifestyle risks. To assess H. pylori intrafamilial transmission in the general population and the role of the family's social background, one study in northern Italy in 1999 examined 416 families (3289 residents). The results indicated that family social status was independently related to infection in children, with blue-collar or farming families showing an increased infection risk compared to children of white-collar workers. Another study conducted on 2752 household members in northern California in 2006 found that exposure to an H. pylori-infected person with gastroenteritis, particularly vomiting, markedly increased the risk for new infection.

A community-based study in 2017 in Vietnam on 219 households (918 individuals) also showed that high monthly income, not regularly being fed chewed food, and being breastfed were protective factors against H. pylori infection. Risk factors for infection in children were not regularly handwashing after defecation, an H. pylori-infected mother and grandfather, the father's occupation, mother's education, and household size. One 2022 family-based H. pylori infection survey on 282 families (772 individuals) also reported that the household infection rate was 87.23% in central China. The work is in line with these studies and provides important evidence indicating that the clustering of infections within the same family was due to increased infection, not simply by chance.

### Influences of diet and the gut microbiome on epigenetic modulation in cancer and other diseases [^116w4KDz]. Clinical Epigenetics (2015). Low credibility.

Gastric cancers are often caused by infection with *Helicobacter pylori*, which induces chronic gastritis and peptic ulcers. Virulent strains harbor the cytotoxin-associated gene pathogenicity island (CagPAI) that encodes components of the type IV secretion system (T4SS). Cag A oncoproteins are transported across the host cell membrane via the T4SS. Studies have shown that *H. pylori* CagPAI dependently induces dephosphorylation of histone H3S10, H3 threonine 3, and deacetylation of H3K23 in gastric epithelial cells but does not affect nine other distinct histone modifications. Microbial pathogens often manipulate host cell mechanisms through histone modifications; hence, targeting these epigenetic modifications may be an important therapeutic strategy to stop the infection. Dietary phytochemicals with HDAC- or HAT-inhibiting properties may play a pivotal role in altering these histone modifications.

### Pan-genomic analyses identify key pathogenic loci modified by carcinogenic host microenvironments [^113kvKVt]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is recognized as the strongest risk factor for gastric cancer; however, the majority of individuals infected with this bacterium do not develop the disease. The pathological outcomes arise from complex interactions involving bacterial, host, and environmental constituents. Two dietary factors associated with gastric cancer risk include iron deficiency and high salt intake. We hypothesized that prolonged adaptation of H. pylori to in vivo carcinogenic microenvironments results in genetic modifications critical for disease progression.

Whole genome sequencing was conducted on genetically related H. pylori strains that differ in virulence. Additionally, targeted H. pylori sequencing followed prolonged exposure of bacteria to in vitro carcinogenic conditions.

A total of 180 unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified when these collective genomes were compared with a reference H. pylori genome. Significantly, common SNPs were found in isolates harvested from iron-depleted and high salt carcinogenic microenvironments, including an SNP within fur (FurR88H). To investigate the direct impact of low iron and/or high salt, H. pylori was continuously cultured in vitro under these conditions to assess fur genetic variation. It was observed that exposure to low iron or high salt selected for the FurR88H variant after only five days. Extending these findings, fur was sequenced in 339 clinical H. pylori strains. Among the isolates examined, 17% (40/232) from patients with premalignant lesions harbored the FurR88H variant, compared with only 6% (6/107) from patients with no lesions.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: Expert review [^114HuxWv]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is recognized as one of the most common chronic bacterial infections worldwide, infecting approximately half of the global population. H. pylori is a World Health Organization (WHO)-designated carcinogen and the strongest known risk factor for noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma, the most prevalent form of gastric cancer. It is also causally linked to peptic ulcer disease. Even though only 1–3% of infected individuals will develop malignant complications, H. pylori accounts for 15% of the total cancer burden globally, with up to 89% of all gastric cancer attributable to H. pylori infection. Accordingly, all major gastroenterological societies recommend that H. pylori be eradicated in individuals who test positive.

Downstream consequences of failed treatment include clinical complications related to persistent H. pylori infection and repeated exposure to antibiotics and high-dose acid suppression, generation of antibiotic resistance in H. pylori and other organisms, as well as the associated direct and indirect costs to the healthcare system. Because the likelihood of successful eradication decreases with each subsequent therapeutic attempt, every effort should be made to address factors that might contribute to eradication failure.

Several guidelines exist to help providers choose regimens to eradicate H. pylori on the first attempt; they also include advice on management after initial treatments fail. However, these guidelines are backed by limited high-quality evidence. In general, they rely heavily on trials conducted.

### Diet synergistically affects helicobacter pylori-induced gastric carcinogenesis in nonhuman primates [^115QkNFt]. Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

- **Aims**: Gastric cancer results from a combination of Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection, exposure to dietary carcinogens, and predisposing genetic make-up. Because the role of these factors in gastric carcinogenesis cannot be determined readily in human beings, the present study examined the role of an oral carcinogen and H pylori infection in rhesus monkeys.

- **Methods**: Gastroscopies were performed in 23 monkeys assigned to four groups: controls, nitrosating carcinogen ethyl-nitro-nitrosoguanidine administration alone, inoculation of a virulent H pylori strain alone (H), and ethyl-nitro-nitrosoguanidine in combination with H pylori (EH). Follow-up gastroscopies and biopsies were performed at 3-month intervals for 5 years for pathologic and molecular studies.

- **Results**: Postinoculation, H and EH groups showed persistent infection and antral gastritis. Starting at 2 and 5 years, respectively, gastric intestinal metaplasia and intraepithelial neoplasia developed in three EH monkeys but in no other groups. Transcriptional analysis of biopsy specimens at 5 years revealed group-specific expression profiles, with striking changes in EH monkeys, plus a neoplasia-specific expression profile characterized by changes in multiple cancer-associated genes. Importantly, this neoplastic profile was evident in nonneoplastic mucosa, suggesting that the identified genes may represent markers preceding cancer.

- **Conclusions**: Gastric intraglandular neoplasia is induced in primates when H pylori infection is associated with consumption of a carcinogen similar to the nitrosamines found in.

### Helicobacter pylori infection and related gastrointestinal diseases [^111VEfUC]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of digestive tract disorders, such as chronic active gastritis, peptic ulceration, gastric cancer, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Disease outcome is dependent on many factors, including bacterial genotype, host physiology and genetics, and environmental factors such as diet. Researchers continue to explore the complexities of H. pylori infection, seeking to explain why some individuals have asymptomatic infection, whereas others experience clinical disease.

The importance of treating H. pylori infection in patients with gastrointestinal problems has been confirmed in recent years, with clinical trials showing that cure of infection can prevent duodenal ulcer and, to a lesser extent, gastric ulcer recurrence; cure early stage mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma; and reduce the chances of developing gastric cancer in high-risk individuals.

### Best treatment approach: Should a national consensus be the best consensus [^114F7fTP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

A significant number of national and international consensuses have been published in the literature during recent years concerning the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). These guidelines are aimed toward achieving an extremely high cure rate (≥ 90%), which seems to be unachievable in real-world settings, especially in areas with high clarithromycin resistance, such as southern Europe. Times change quickly and, as with other infectious diseases, we are moving inevitably from a trial-and-error therapeutic approach to a susceptibility-based one. Empirical first-line treatments should be based on what works best in each geographical and/or national area and must take into account the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in each region.

We have reviewed the basic conclusive suggestions from the existing guidelines and consensuses worldwide concerning the best anti-H. pylori treatment approach in relation to antibiotic resistance. According to this global plethora of recommendations, it is worth remembering that the determinants of a successful H. pylori eradication could be divided into host-related factors (e.g. previous antibiotic exposure, patient's adherence to a multi-drug regimen, and/or genetic factors) and H. pylori-related factors, with antibiotic sensitivity appearing to be the most important and consistent predictor of success, both in clinical trials and in population-based studies of H. pylori eradication. Thus, it is of major importance for a country's clinical practitioners to know the local pattern of resistance.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^111BbbVZ]. Gut (2022). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy

Given that 5% of dyspepsia in the community is attributable to H. pylori, and up to 80% of individuals with dyspepsia have functional dyspepsia (FD), eradicating the bacterium in patients diagnosed with FD who are found to be H. pylori-positive is logical. Updating the prior meta-analysis of H. pylori eradication therapy for infected patients with FD, with 10 new trials recruiting 2,896 patients, demonstrated a significant benefit over a control of antisecretory therapy or prokinetics, with or without placebo antibiotics, or a placebo alone in terms of symptom cure or improvement. The risk ratio (RR) of symptoms not being cured or improving in 29 trials, containing 6,781 patients, was 0.87 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.92), with significant heterogeneity between studies (I² = 64%).

The effect was even larger in individuals whose infection was eradicated successfully, compared with those receiving control therapy, in 16 trials containing 2,809 patients (0.74; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.85). When only those trials that reported symptom cure were included in the analysis, most of which assessed this at 12 months, there was still a significant benefit of H. pylori eradication therapy (RR of symptoms not being cured = 0.91; 95% CI 0.88 to 0.94), with low heterogeneity between studies (I² = 7%).

Total numbers of adverse events were only reported by eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs), containing 1,937 patients, but were significantly more common with eradication therapy. Individual adverse events were not reported in sufficient detail by the trials.

### Dietary habits and infection: Is there an association [^111wej2x]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

The prevalence of H. pylori infections was 44.2%. Males and obese individuals are more likely to be infected with H. pylori. The findings of this study indicated that dietary habits influence the presence of H. pylori infection. Consumption of refined grains increases the chance of infection, which may reinforce the role of H. pylori in metabolic diseases. Interestingly, fruit consumption also had a positive association with the presence of bacteria, probably because of its role as a vehicle for transmission of this pathogen. Further research is required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the associations identified in this study.

The categorization of H. pylori gastritis according to gastritis subsites, together with the assessment of gastritis severity, allows prediction of an individual's risk of developing severe gastroduodenal complications and, in particular, gastric cancer. Depending on the gastric subsites involved, gastric function and, in particular, gastric acid secretion may be profoundly affected. This can result in gastric acid hypersecretion, hyposecretion, or even achlorhydria.

Subsite characterization of gastritis is critically important for identifying patients who remain at high risk after H. pylori eradication. These patients are candidates for regular endoscopic and histological follow-up. Patients with severe atrophic gastritis (with or without intestinal metaplasia) in the corpus or with severe corpus-predominant gastritis are at the highest risk for progression to gastric cancer of the intestinal type and diffuse-type gastric cancer. In diffuse-type gastric cancer, the prevalence of antral atrophic gastritis is almost identical to that seen in the intestinal type but is slightly less common with corpus atrophic gastritis than with intestinal type gastric cancer.

- **Is it necessary to categorise gastritis according to histology (severity) and/or endoscopy?** It is advisable to categorize gastritis according to histology because the risk of developing gastric cancer in H. pylori gastritis varies according to the extent and severity of inflammation and atrophy.

- **Grade of recommendation**: Strong
- **Evidence level**: High
- **Consensus level**: 100%

### Associations of atrophic gastritis and proton-pump inhibitor drug use with vitamin B-12 status, and the impact of fortified foods, in older adults [^116Mw1mY]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Low credibility.

Vitamin B-12 deficiency is a global problem associated with several adverse health outcomes. Poor dietary intake is considered a major cause of deficiency in low- and middle-income countries, typically in regions where vegan diets or limited animal foods are consumed. Gastrointestinal infections and infestations, along with host–microbiota interactions, can also be contributory factors. The deficient vitamin B-12 status commonly found in older adults in high-income countries is rarely attributable to low dietary intakes, which are typically found to exceed recommendations. Rather, it results from malabsorption due to hypochlorhydria. As shown in the study, older adults with atrophic gastritis or taking proton-pump inhibitor drugs can benefit from consuming fortified foods. The crystalline vitamin B-12 form added in the fortification process — unlike protein-bound vitamin B-12 in natural food sources — does not require gastric acid for its absorption.

Furthermore, reported vitamin B-12 supplement use in older adults is much lower in Europe (< 11%) than in the United States (36%), potentially placing older European adults at greater risk of vitamin B-12 deficiency. In order to protect older adults from a potentially higher risk of cognitive dysfunction, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease associated with low vitamin B-12 status, further research investigating the efficacy of interventions to improve vitamin B-12 status is required. Also, in future studies, two or more vitamin B-12 biomarkers should be used, and ideally, the combined vitamin B-12 indicator calculated, to ensure comprehensive assessment.

### Non-antibiotic therapies for Helicobacter pylori infection [^111Ywfqj]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Despite years of experience with Helicobacter pylori treatment, the ideal regimen for treating the infection has not been found. The most effective eradication treatment is the combination of a proton pump inhibitor with antibiotics, but 10–20% of patients fail to achieve eradication of the infection. Antibiotic resistance is a major factor affecting the outcome of treatment. Non-antibiotic therapies, including phytomedicines, probiotics, and antioxidants, have been increasingly investigated as potential alternatives for the treatment of H. pylori. In this article, we review the non-antibiotic therapies for H. pylori infection.

### Helicobacter pylori: Gastric cancer and beyond [^112tjUJQ]. Nature Reviews Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is the dominant species of the human gastric microbiome, and its colonization causes a persistent inflammatory response. H. pylori-induced gastritis is the strongest singular risk factor for cancers of the stomach; however, only a small proportion of infected individuals develop malignancy. Carcinogenic risk is modified by strain-specific bacterial components, host responses, and/or specific host-microbe interactions. The delineation of bacterial and host mediators that augment gastric cancer risk has profound ramifications for both physicians and biomedical researchers. Such findings will not only focus prevention approaches that target H. pylori-infected human populations at an increased risk for stomach cancer but will also provide mechanistic insights into inflammatory carcinomas that develop beyond the gastric niche.

### Implications of the paradigm shift in management of infections [^112oTtHN]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infections are etiologically related to peptic ulcer, atrophic gastritis, and gastric cancer. Since H. pylori's discovery in the 1980s, antimicrobial therapy for H. pylori infections has primarily been empiric, with potentially effective therapies being identified by trial and error; cure rates were generally low (Figures 1 and 2). It soon became apparent that finding an ideal therapy was going to be difficult, as resistance to the commonly used antibiotics developed rapidly and exerted a detrimental effect on cure rates. Antibiotic regimens approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) often had relatively low cure rates, as the focus was on healing of peptic ulcers rather than on cure of the infection. Although H. pylori was declared a carcinogen by the World Health Organization in 1994, the clinical focus remained on peptic ulcer, which, at that time, was a major health problem; in the United States, gastric cancer was becoming increasingly rare. The concept that cure of the infection would also prevent development of atrophic gastritis, long recognized as a precursor lesion for gastric cancer, was not immediately recognized.

### Dietary habits and infection: Is there an association [^1159hSwZ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Moderate fruit consumption was positively associated with H. pylori infection. This result contrasts with studies demonstrating that fruit consumption has a protective effect against this bacterium. However, it is worth considering that the consumption of raw fruits and vegetables, often irrigated by water contaminated by feces, has been associated with H. pylori transmission. Bacteria can form a biofilm, which favors the persistence of microorganisms in the environment for long periods. Moreover, the cells in biofilms are highly resistant to elimination by sanitizing agents. Thus, raw vegetables can potentially serve as vehicles for the transmission of this pathogen.

Food can also be contaminated with H. pylori due to poor hygiene practices during processing. Food handling can contribute to contamination via hands, nails, and oral and nasal secretions. Previous studies have shown that some types of raw ready-to-eat foods, such as fruit salad, can be sources of resistant and virulent H. pylori strains.

Some limitations of this study should be considered when interpreting these results. The sample comprised individuals who sought health care; these patients are probably more likely to have been diagnosed with H. pylori and thus changed their eating habits. Due to the nature of the self-reported questionnaire, there is information and memory bias, and the amount of food intake may not be accurate. Another limiting factor was the lack of information regarding the previous treatment of the infection. Finally, the cross-sectional design precludes inference of causality.

### Long-term use of proton-pump inhibitors and risk of gastric cancer: A review of the current evidence [^11157Qx5]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

The acid suppression caused by proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) can lead to both luminal and mucosal non-Helicobacter pylori bacterial overgrowth in the stomach, potentially exacerbating chronic inflammation. It has been shown that non-H. pylori bacterial overgrowth is a risk factor for atrophic gastritis (antrum: RR 5.07; 95% CI 1.05–24.40; corpus: RR 6.38; 95% CI 0.78–53.89). The simultaneous infection with H. pylori and non-H. pylori bacteria has a synergistic effect on inducing a higher level of serum cytokines — such as interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-8 — and increasing the risk of atrophic gastritis.

Moreover, there is an increase in the number of bacteria, including non-gastric microorganisms mainly from oral flora, that possess nitrate reductase. This enzyme can produce N-nitroso compounds from food nitrates, known gastric carcinogens. Interestingly, it has been shown that gastric microbiota alteration is distinct in atrophic gastritis. Proton-pump inhibitor users showed similarly high gastric microbial diversity as healthy subjects. A relatively high gastric microbial diversity, dominated by Streptococcus, was observed in autoimmune gastritis, while a decreased microbial abundance and diversity was induced by H. pylori infection.

### Carcinogenesis of Helicobacter pylori [^1145UEN1]. Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Helicobacter infection is the leading cause of gastric cancer worldwide. Infection with this ubiquitous bacterium incites a chronic active immune response that persists for the life of the host, in the absence of antibiotic-induced eradication. It is the combination of bacterial factors, environmental insults, and the host immune response that drives the initiation and progression of mucosal atrophy, metaplasia, and dysplasia toward gastric cancer. Although it may seem intuitively obvious that removing the offending organism would negate the cancer risk, this approach is neither feasible (half of the world harbors this infection) nor straightforward. Most patients are infected in childhood and present with various degrees of mucosal damage before any therapy.

This review outlines the histologic progression of human Helicobacter infection from the early stages of inflammation through the development of metaplasia, dysplasia, and, finally, cancer. The effects of dietary and bacterial eradication therapy on disease progression and lesion reversibility are reviewed within the context of population studies and compared between study designs and populations tested. Eradication studies in the mouse model of infection prevent the formation of gastric cancer and allow regression of established lesions, providing a useful model to study interaction between the bacterium, environment, and host without the difficulties inherent in human population studies. Recent advances in identifying the bone marrow-derived stem cell as the cell of origin of Helicobacter-induced gastric cancer are also discussed.

### Proton-pump inhibitors should be strictly prescribed in clinic [^112YPmwi]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

As gastric cancer is one of the most prevalent gastrointestinal malignancies, it imposes a significant burden worldwide. Various factors including Helicobacter pylori (HP) infections, smoking, high-salt diets, and intake of nitroso compounds have been associated with stomach carcinogenesis. To improve the gastric mucosa's microenvironment, proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used in clinical settings. However, recent studies have shown that PPI overuse is linked to an increased risk of gastric cancer. Conversely, no significant relationships have been found in other studies.

A recent study entitled "Association between proton-pump inhibitors and the risk of gastric cancer: a systematic review with meta-analysis" by Segna et al. provided relatively high-grade evidence regarding this controversial relationship. As the largest study, Segna et al. included 1,662,881 subjects across 13 studies, comprising five retrospective cohort and eight case-control studies for meta-analysis. The research found that the risk of gastric cancer doubled among PPI users compared to controls.

To accurately analyze PPI effectiveness on gastric cancer, Segna et al. performed various subgroup analyses. They first conducted a subgroup analysis based on tumor location, discovering that PPI use was associated with an increased risk of non-cardia cancer rather than cardia cancer. Although substantial heterogeneity is present within both subgroups, the relationship remains significant.

### Prevention of gastric cancer: When is treatment of Helicobacter pylori warranted [^111FaYK4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic gastritis induced by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the strongest known risk factor for adenocarcinoma of the distal stomach, yet the effects of bacterial eradication on carcinogenesis remain unclear. H. pylori isolates possess substantial genotypic diversity, which engenders differential host inflammatory responses that influence clinical outcomes. Strains of H. pylori that possess the cag pathogenicity island and secrete a functional cytotoxin induce more severe gastric injury and further augment the risk for developing distal gastric cancer.

Carcinogenesis is also influenced by host genetic diversity, particularly involving immune response genes such as interleukin-1ß and tumor necrosis factor-α. Human trials and animal studies have indicated that eradication of H. pylori prior to the development of atrophic gastritis offers the best chance for prevention of gastric cancer.

However, although the timing of intervention influences the magnitude of suppression of premalignant and neoplastic lesions, bacterial eradication, even in longstanding infections, is of clear benefit to the host. It is important to gain insight into the pathogenesis of H. pylori-induced gastritis and adenocarcinoma not only to develop more effective treatments for gastric cancer but also because it might serve as a paradigm for the role of chronic inflammation in the genesis of other malignancies that arise within the gastrointestinal tract.

### Ulcer and gastritis [^115NJa9U]. Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

The literature on peptic ulcer and gastritis in 2000 again focused on the topics of Helicobacter pylori, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and gastric cancer. New diagnostic tests for H. pylori infection have been evaluated, and rescue therapies for failed H. pylori eradication have been tested. The causal relationship between H. pylori infection and nonulcer dyspepsia, gastric cancer, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and NSAID-related ulcers remained heated topics of debate.

- **Clinical trials and meta-analyses**: In 2000, landmark clinical trials and meta-analyses were published addressing these issues.

- **Endoscopy's role**: The role of endoscopy in managing nonulcer dyspepsia was better defined.

- **H. pylori eradication in NSAID users**: The role of H. pylori eradication in NSAID/aspirin users was reexamined in high-risk patients.

- **COX-2 inhibitors**: Clinical benefit was finally confirmed for specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2).

The millennium year turned out to be a very important one in the advancement of knowledge in this field.

### Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with an increased rate of diabetes [^116M2aXu]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular diseases and diabetes disproportionately affect individuals of low socioeconomic status and minority race in the U.S. Behavioral risk factors, such as poor diet, smoking, and physical inactivity, are well-known contributors to the disparity but only partially explain the gap in health outcomes. Other contributing factors may include chronic infections that are more prevalent among minorities and individuals of low socioeconomic status. Studies suggest that pathogen burden, including infectious agents such as cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Helicobacter pylori, may impact cardiovascular conditions and metabolic syndrome, potentially mediated by elevations in inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6.

Inflammation and activated innate immunity have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes through insulin resistance. For example, elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines may lead to phosphorylation of serine residues on the insulin receptor substrate, which prevents its interaction with insulin receptors and inhibits insulin action. Lipopolysaccharides from pathogens in the gut, such as H. pylori, have also been linked to the activation of Toll-like receptors, resulting in energy harvesting, fat accumulation, stimulation of the innate immune system, and consequent insulin resistance. However, epidemiological studies investigating the impact of pathogen burden on diabetes have been limited. A previous study found an increased risk of diabetes in people with a high pathogen burden.

### Helicobacter pylori adaptation in vivo in response to a high-salt diet [^114ZSq6u]. Infection and Immunity (2015). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori exhibits a high level of intraspecies genetic diversity. In this study, we investigated whether the diversification of H. pylori is influenced by the composition of the diet. Specifically, we investigated the effect of a high-salt diet (a known risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma) on H. pylori diversification within a host. We analyzed H. pylori strains isolated from Mongolian gerbils fed either a high-salt diet or a regular diet for four months using proteomic and whole-genome sequencing methods. Compared to the input strain and output strains from animals fed a regular diet, the output strains from animals fed a high-salt diet produced higher levels of proteins involved in iron acquisition and oxidative-stress resistance. Several of these changes were attributable to a nonsynonymous mutation in fur (fur-R88H). Further experiments indicated that this mutation conferred increased resistance to high-salt conditions and oxidative stress. We propose a model in which a high-salt diet leads to high levels of gastric inflammation and associated oxidative stress in H. pylori-infected animals and that these conditions, along with the high intraluminal concentrations of sodium chloride, lead to selection of H. pylori strains that are most fit for growth in this environment.

### Helicobacter pylori eradication for the prevention of gastric neoplasia [^113b8PRA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Gastric cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Individuals infected with Helicobacter pylori have a higher likelihood of developing gastric cancer than those who are not infected. Eradication of H. pylori in healthy asymptomatic individuals in the general population may reduce the incidence of gastric cancer, but the magnitude of this effect is unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of eradication of H. pylori in healthy asymptomatic individuals in the general population in reducing the incidence of gastric cancer.

- **Search methods**: We identified trials by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to February 2020), and EMBASE (1974 to February 2020). We handsearched reference lists from trials selected by electronic searches to identify further relevant trials. Additionally, we reviewed published abstracts from conference proceedings from the United European Gastroenterology Week (published in Gut) and Digestive Disease Week (published in Gastroenterology) between 2001 and 2019. We also contacted members of the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Review Group and experts in the field to obtain details of ongoing clinical trials and any relevant unpublished materials.

- **Selection criteria**: We analyzed randomized controlled trials comparing at least one week of H. pylori therapy with placebo or no treatment in preventing subsequent development of gastric cancer in otherwise healthy and asymptomatic H. pylori-positive adults. Trials had to

### Accessible homeostatic gastric organoids reveal secondary cell type-specific host-pathogen interactions in Helicobacter pylori infections [^116UZzgW]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Despite the high prevalence of gastric diseases like gastric cancer and peptic ulcer disease attributed to Helicobacter pylori infections, there remains a limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Existing in vitro models are either two-dimensional systems lacking the structural complexity of the gastric architecture, or complex three-dimensional systems that pose challenges for experimental access.

In this study, we introduce a patterned homeostatic human gastric organoid-on-a-chip system with bilateral access, capable of modeling H. pylori niche establishment and persistent colonization of the gastric epithelium. We demonstrate that in physiological apical acidic conditions, our organ-on-a-chip can generate pit cells of higher maturity compared to traditionally grown organoids. Upon infection with H. pylori for up to 6 days, these mature pit cells exhibit a distinctive response from other cell types, which was previously uncharacterized.

Beyond its application in studying H. pylori infection, the increased structural and functional relevance of our model offers broader significance as a versatile platform for advancing our understanding of gastric epithelial cell interactions, gastric mucosal immunity, and host-pathogen interactions.

### Dietary habits and infection: Is there an association [^1172oXzq]? Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Brazil, particularly in the Midwest region, has a high prevalence of H. pylori infection. Since the presence of this infection can be influenced by diet, it is important to identify foods that act as protective factors as well as those that may promote infection. However, data on the association between dietary habits and H. pylori infection in this region are limited. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the association between eating habits and H. pylori infection in patients admitted to a reference hospital in the Brazilian Midwest.

### Pan-genomic analyses identify key pathogenic loci modified by carcinogenic host microenvironments [^1164X4Ui]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is the strongest risk factor for gastric cancer; however, the majority of infected individuals do not develop disease. Pathological outcomes are mediated by complex interactions among bacterial, host, and environmental constituents. Two dietary factors linked with gastric cancer risk are iron deficiency and high salt. We hypothesized that prolonged adaptation of H. pylori to in vivo carcinogenic microenvironments results in genetic modification important for disease.

- **Design**: Whole genome sequencing of genetically related H. pylori strains that differ in virulence and targeted H. pylori sequencing following prolonged exposure of bacteria to in vitro carcinogenic conditions were performed.

- **Results**: A total of 180 unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified among the collective genomes when compared with a reference H. pylori genome. Importantly, common SNPs were identified in isolates harvested from iron-depleted and high salt carcinogenic microenvironments, including an SNP within fur (FurR88H). To investigate the direct role of low iron and/or high salt, H. pylori was continuously cultured in vitro under low iron or high salt conditions to assess fur genetic variation. Exposure to low iron or high salt selected for the FurR88H variant after only 5 days. To extend these results, fur was sequenced in 339 clinical H. pylori strains. Among the isolates examined, 17% (40/232) of strains isolated from patients with premalignant lesions harbored the FurR88H variant, compared with only 6% (6/107) of strains from patients without premalignant lesions.

### Large-scale, national, family-based epidemiological study on infection in China: The time to change practice for related disease prevention [^111prBvN]. Gut (2023). Low credibility.

Geographical location is important for diverse H. pylori infection status due to various lifestyles among different countries. In accordance with already known risk factors from previous studies, this survey reveals risk factors that have not been well recognized, with some unique to China or Asian countries. One such factor is that using serving chopsticks and spoons is associated with a lower infection rate. Sharing food with the same utensils or dishes is a traditional habit preserved in China and many Asian countries for centuries. This practice was considered a risk factor for H. pylori infection because the saliva culture of H. pylori-infected patients has confirmed the existence of oral H. pylori, and H. pylori DNA can be detected on chopsticks. Another family habit is chewing food before feeding it to children, a practice that was common previously but is now rare in childcare. This is also supported by a population-based study in China in 2015, which showed that individually served meals represented an independent protective factor for H. pylori infection.

H. pylori infection rates vary greatly depending on different geographical locations in China. The north and northwest regions are high-prevalence areas for both H. pylori infection and gastric cancer incidence, which correlates well with socioeconomic status, living conditions, and lifestyle habits. For example, in Qinghai and Gansu, the two developing pasturing northwest regions, there is a higher H. pylori infection rate and gastric cancer incidence.

### Stomach cancer risk in gastric cancer relatives: Interaction between Helicobacter pylori infection and family history of gastric cancer for the risk of stomach cancer [^112dw1ud]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

To identify the risk of gastric cancer in first-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients, this study aims to determine if there is an interaction between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and family history of gastric cancer in gastric carcinogenesis.

- **Background**: It is unclear to what degree a family history of gastric cancer is associated with stomach cancer risk in Korea.

- **Study**: From May 2003 to July 2008, 428 gastric cancer patients and 368 controls were included in the analyses. Logistic regression models, which included age, sex, family history of gastric cancer, residency during childhood, smoking, monthly income, spicy food diet, and H. pylori status, were evaluated to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of developing gastric cancer.

- **Results**: The adjusted OR for gastric cancer increased 3-fold for subjects reporting first-degree relatives with gastric cancer [OR 2.85, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.83–4.46]. The association was strong in the 40 to 59 years age group (OR 4.00, 95% CI: 2.06–7.76) and became weaker in subjects older than 60 years of age (OR 1.81, 95% CI: 0.95–3.46). Compared with uninfected subjects without a family history, subjects with both a family history and H. pylori infection had a 5-fold increased risk (OR 5.32, 95% CI: 2.76–10.25).

- **Conclusions**: After adjusting for environmental factors and H. pylori infection, a family history of gastric cancer remained independently associated with gastric cancer. The interaction between H. pylori infection and family history of gastric cancer might be a rationale for H. pylori eradication in gastric cancer prevention.

### Innate immune activation and modulatory factors of Helicobacter pylori towards phagocytic and nonphagocytic cells [^117UhvUK]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is an intriguing obligate host-associated human pathogen with a specific host interaction biology, which has been shaped by thousands of years of host-pathogen coevolution. Molecular mechanisms of interaction of H. pylori with the local immune cells in the human system are less well defined than epithelial cell interactions, although various myeloid cells, including neutrophils and other phagocytes, are locally present or attracted to the sites of infection and interact with H. pylori. We have recently addressed the question of novel bacterial innate immune stimuli, including bacterial cell envelope metabolites, that can activate and modulate cell responses via the H. pylori Cag type IV secretion system.

This review article gives an overview of what is currently known about the interaction modes and mechanisms of H. pylori with diverse human cell types, with a focus on bacterial metabolites and cells of the myeloid lineage including phagocytic and antigen-presenting cells.

### Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy to prevent gastric cancer in healthy asymptomatic infected individuals: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111yg7V4]. BMJ (2014). High credibility.

The characteristics of eligible and included studies, such as demographic data of participants, methods used to ascertain gastric cancer incidence, and Helicobacter pylori eradication rates, which were reported using a true intention-to-treat analysis with all drop-outs assumed to have failed eradication therapy, are detailed. Three of the trials, reported in five separate publications, utilized a factorial design with some participants also randomized to receive vitamins, antioxidants, or celecoxib (see appendix 2 of the supplementary data). The majority of trials were conducted in Japan or China, with only one study being conducted outside this region, among a population at high risk of gastric cancer in Colombia. The longest duration of follow-up in the studies we identified was 14.7 years, and the shortest duration was ≥ 4 years.

Three trials were at low risk of bias, one trial was at unclear risk, and two trials were at high risk of bias. Of the two trials at high risk of bias, one was due to the absence of a placebo comparator for the active eradication therapy, rendering this part of the trial unblinded; the other was due to inconsistencies in data reporting at two points of follow-up, with 10 gastric cancers reported at five years, compared with nine at 10 years. In the case of this latter trial, data from the 10-year follow-up was used in our primary analysis, but the five-year data was substituted in a sensitivity analysis.

### Approach to anaemia in gastrointestinal disease: A position paper by the ESPGHAN gastroenterology committee [^112B13wS]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Low credibility.

Gastritis caused by H. pylori infections affects more than half of the world population. The severity and phenotype of gastric pathology depend on a complex interplay between various factors of the bacteria itself, the host, and the environment. Although it is well documented that persistent H. pylori infection in the gastric mucosa in children can lead to iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), the pathogenesis and specific risk factors remain poorly understood. Most children with H. pylori-associated anaemia do not show evidence of overt blood loss due to gastrointestinal haemorrhagic lesions. Unlike adults, in H. pylori-infected children, gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia are rarely found, suggesting that impaired gastric acid secretion may not be a primary or direct cause of H. pylori-associated IDA. Therefore, some other possible mechanisms have been proposed. These include competition for iron availability, the role of hepcidin, the role of outer membrane proteins (some encoding genes are involved in iron-uptake mechanisms), the VacA and sabA gene, concomitant diseases such as coeliac disease, parasitic infection, and poor iron intake.

H. pylori-negative chronic gastritis, apart from H. pylori gastritis, includes other forms such as eosinophilic gastritis and autoimmune atrophic gastritis, which may present with anaemia. Clinical presentation of eosinophilic gastritis is variable, with abdominal pain as the most common symptom, followed by vomiting and other symptoms, including anaemia, melaena, food aversions, failure to thrive, oedema, and ascites.

### The relationship between inflammatory bowel disease and across East Asian, European and Mediterranean countries: a meta-analysis [^111MjEPp]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Regional and subtype disparities in the protective effect of H. pylori on IBD remain circumstantial and have yet to be formally tested in a meta-analytic framework. Such a study is imperative, since significant effects of region and/or subtype may shed light on IBD's etiology, which is currently unclear. This meta-analysis aims to bridge this important research gap by simultaneously incorporating subtype and region in an all-encompassing meta-regression model.

We studied three specific geographic regions, namely East Asia, Europe (non-Mediterranean), and the Mediterranean. The selection of these particular regions was guided by existing studies that recognized differences in potential risk factors, IBD characteristics, or features unique to these populations, such as the Mediterranean diet. The publication of a sizeable and approximately balanced number of primary studies from East Asian, European, and Mediterranean countries is desirable from a statistical power standpoint and provided further motivation for our study.

Our meta-analysis aimed to address the following research questions:

- **Does the association between IBD and H. pylori vary by IBD subtype**: We explored whether different subtypes of IBD showed varying levels of association with H. pylori presence.

- **Does the association between IBD and H. pylori vary by region**: We examined if the geographic location influenced the relationship between IBD and H. pylori.

- **Is there an interaction effect of IBD subtype and region on the association between IBD and H. pylori**: This question focused on identifying any combined effects of region and IBD subtype on the association with H. pylori.

### American College of Gastroenterology guideline on the management of Helicobacter pylori infection [^1163U1jf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) remains a prevalent, worldwide, chronic infection. Though the prevalence of this infection appears to be decreasing in many parts of the world, H. pylori remains an important factor linked to the development of peptic ulcer disease, gastric malignancy, and dyspeptic symptoms. Whether to test for H. pylori in patients with functional dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with iron deficiency anemia, or who are at greater risk of developing gastric cancer remains controversial.

H. pylori can be diagnosed by endoscopic or non-endoscopic methods. A variety of factors including the need for endoscopy, pretest probability of infection, local availability, and an understanding of the performance characteristics and cost of the individual tests influences choice of evaluation in a given patient. Testing to prove eradication should be performed in patients who receive treatment of H. pylori for peptic ulcer disease, individuals with persistent dyspeptic symptoms despite the test-and-treat strategy, those with H. pylori-associated MALT lymphoma, and individuals who have undergone resection of early gastric cancer.

Recent studies suggest that eradication rates achieved by first-line treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), clarithromycin, and amoxicillin have decreased to 70–85%, in part due to increasing clarithromycin resistance. Eradication rates may also be lower with 7 versus 14-day regimens. Bismuth-containing quadruple regimens for 7–14 days are another first-line treatment option.

### Analysis of Helicobacter pylori cagA promoter elements required for salt-induced upregulation of CagA expression [^115Srw7k]. Infection and Immunity (2012). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection and consumption of a high-salt diet are each associated with an increased risk for the development of gastric cancer. To investigate potential synergism between these factors, we used a global proteomic approach to analyze H. pylori strains cultured in media containing varying salt concentrations. Among the differentially expressed proteins identified, CagA exhibited the greatest increase in expression in response to high salt concentrations.

Analysis of 36 H. pylori strains isolated from patients in two regions of Colombia with differing incidences of gastric cancer revealed marked differences among strains in salt-responsive CagA expression. Sequence analysis of the cagA promoter region in these strains revealed a DNA motif (TAATGA) that was present in either one or two copies. Salt-induced upregulation of CagA expression was detected more commonly in strains containing two copies of the TAATGA motif than in strains containing one copy. Mutagenesis experiments confirmed that two copies of the TAATGA motif are required for salt-induced upregulation of CagA expression.

In summary, there is considerable heterogeneity among H. pylori strains in salt-regulated CagA expression, and these differences are attributable to variation in a specific DNA motif upstream of the cagA transcriptional start site.

### Genome-wide analysis of chromosomal import patterns after natural transformation of Helicobacter pylori [^116LwBP2]. Nature Communications (2016). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is one of the most successful bacterial pathogens, infecting the stomachs of more than half of all humans. H. pylori infection causes chronic active gastritis, which can progress to severe diseases, including gastroduodenal ulcers and gastric cancer. The species displays exceptional genetic diversity and variability, partly due to a very high mutation rate that results from a lack of genes encoding a classical methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system (mutHLS1) and from the translesion-synthesis properties of its DNA polymerase I. An exceptionally high recombination rate is an additional hallmark of H. pylori and leads to the exchange of large proportions of its genome during mixed infections with different strains within one stomach. Recombination has been shown to be the dominant driving force of genetic diversification of H. pylori, introducing up to 109 times more substitutions than mutation.

H. pylori is naturally competent for DNA uptake. Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is imported into the periplasm via the ComB transport system and is thought to be followed by the conversion of dsDNA to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and subsequent transfer into the cytoplasm. Within the cytoplasm, ssDNA interacts with DprA and RecA prior to recombination into the recipient's genome. In vitro, mean import lengths depend on donor–recipient combinations and range from 1.3 to 3.8 kb, whereas shorter imports were calculated from comparative sequence analyses of sequential patient isolates (estimated mean lengths: ∼400 bp).

### Dietary habits and infection: Is there an association [^114KwRTc]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

In this study, the prevalence of H. pylori infection was 44.2%. This value is considered high when compared with data from developed countries such as Switzerland and Australia, which have prevalence rates of 18.9% and 24.6%, respectively. A recent meta-analysis reported a prevalence of 69.26% in adults in Latin America and the Caribbean. In Brazil, the prevalence is heterogeneous in different regions, with proportions of 31.7%, 61.1%, and 91% in the Southeast, Midwest, and North regions, respectively. The prevalence of infection depends on different factors, and it is necessary to consider that these values may have been influenced by the living conditions of the population, different diagnostic methods, genetic characteristics of patients and bacteria, and lifestyle habits, among others.

Male individuals were more likely to be infected with H. pylori. Some studies have found no relationship between sex and infection. However, the results of this study corroborate a robust meta-analysis that showed a male predominance in the prevalence of H. pylori in adult populations from all continents. Differences in sex in the prevalence of H. pylori infection among adults may be explained by distinct exposure to environmental factors such as smoking, which has been associated in the literature with an increased risk of H. pylori infection. It has also been hypothesized that physiological differences, especially sex hormones, may affect immunity and inflammatory responses to H. pylori differently in males and females.

### Helicobacter pylori infection [^111izjHY]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Low credibility.

The principal effect of Helicobacter pylori infection is lifelong chronic gastritis, affecting up to 20% of younger adults and 50% to 80% of adults born in resource-rich countries before 1950.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of H. pylori eradication treatment in people with confirmed duodenal ulcers, confirmed gastric ulcers, confirmed gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), confirmed non-ulcer dyspepsia, uninvestigated dyspepsia, localized B-cell lymphoma of the stomach, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-related peptic ulcers? What are the effects of H. pylori eradication treatment for preventing NSAID-related peptic ulcers in people with or without previous ulcers or dyspepsia? What are the effects of H. pylori eradication treatment on the risk of developing gastric cancer? Do H. pylori eradication treatments differ in their effects? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2007. We included harm alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 58 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current evidence regarding H. pylori eradication treatments and their implications for clinical practice.

### The rise and rise of eosinophilic gut diseases including eosinophilic esophagitis is probably not explained by the disappearance of Helicobacter pylori, so who or what's to blame [^111mdbvA]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

A dramatic increase in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and atopic disease, alongside a dramatic decline in Helicobacter pylori infection, has been observed in recent decades. Previously, it was speculated that the immune response to H. pylori might protect against allergic diseases, including EoE. However, this study by Molina-Infante et al. shows no clear relationship and suggests that any correlation is not causal. It is likely that a combination of factors, such as a changing microbiome, increasing hygiene, and alterations in early life — such as antibiotic exposure, changing diet, and other lifestyle factors — drive the increase in atopic diseases, including food allergies and EoE.

### Associations of atrophic gastritis and proton-pump inhibitor drug use with vitamin B-12 status, and the impact of fortified foods, in older adults [^113kEM2r]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Low credibility.

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are gastric acid suppression drugs commonly used to treat conditions caused or exacerbated by an overproduction of stomach acid, such as simple heartburn, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. By inducing hypochlorhydria, there is concern that these drugs, widely prescribed to older adults and also available over the counter, could contribute to food-bound vitamin B-12 malabsorption with long-term use and ultimately lead to vitamin B-12 deficiency in an already vulnerable group. The evidence at the time of writing is inconsistent, with some studies showing no association of PPIs with vitamin B-12 and others reporting an increased risk of vitamin B-12 deficiency with long-term PPI use.

A limited number of previous studies have examined vitamin B-12 status in relation to atrophic gastritis (AG) or PPI drug use, typically using a single biomarker. Given the limitations of each of the direct [total vitamin B-12 and holotranscobalamin (holoTC)] and functional [homocysteine and methylmalonic acid (MMA)] biomarkers, there is general agreement that the use of a sole vitamin B-12 biomarker should be avoided, and at least two biomarkers should be used to diagnose deficiency. Furthermore, to our knowledge, the potential of vitamin B-12–fortified foods to protect against vitamin B-12 depletion caused by hypochlorhydria has not been considered. The aim, therefore, was to investigate associations of AG and PPI use with vitamin B-12 status and the potential protective role of fortified foods in older adults. We hypothesized that vitamin B-12–fortified foods would alleviate any adverse association.

### The relationship between inflammatory bowel disease and across East Asian, European and Mediterranean countries: a meta-analysis [^113XkxXc]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Regional variation in the protective effect of H. pylori on IBD might also be ascribed to environmental and socioeconomic factors, such as the role of diet. The Western diet is thought to be particularly conducive to IBD, owing to the low intake of fiber and high intake of refined carbohydrate and processed meat. Indeed, as IBD incidence continues to rise in Asia, many studies have suggested that this could be the result of Asian populations adopting the Western diet.

The Mediterranean diet, plant-based diet, and semi-vegetarian diet have been shown by some studies to help alleviate symptoms of IBD and keep IBD patients in remission. It is noteworthy that the Mediterranean diet has also been reported to reduce inflammation and improve microbiota in IBD patients. Interestingly, our meta-analysis found that the protective effect of H. pylori against IBD in Mediterranean populations is less than in both East Asian and European counterparts, though only the former difference was statistically significant.

Although this might suggest that the protective effect of diet is questionable, our meta-analysis did not explicitly incorporate dietary information, and any putative effects of diet might be confounded in such a broad-scale analysis. Nevertheless, this does raise the need for further research into the role of diet on the incidence of IBD. Although numerous studies have been conducted on recommended diets for the prevention of IBD, there is still no consensus as to which is optimal. Robust clinical trials have been limited by challenges such as defining the diet intervention.

### Cure of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with reflux oesophagitis treated with long term omeprazole reverses gastritis without exacerbation of reflux disease: results of a randomised controlled trial [^114D727b]. Gut (2004). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori gastritis may progress to glandular atrophy and intestinal metaplasia, conditions that predispose individuals to gastric cancer. Profound suppression of gastric acid is associated with increased severity of H. pylori gastritis. This prospective randomised study aimed to investigate whether H. pylori eradication can influence gastritis and its sequelae during long-term omeprazole therapy for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).

A total of 231 H. pylori positive GORD patients who had been treated for 12 months or more with omeprazole maintenance therapy (OM) were randomised to either continuation of OM (OM only; n = 120) or OM plus a one-week course of omeprazole, amoxycillin, and clarithromycin (OM triple; n = 111). Endoscopy with standardised biopsy sampling as well as symptom evaluation were performed at baseline and after one and two years. Gastritis was assessed according to the Sydney classification system for activity, inflammation, atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and H. pylori density.

- **Results**: Corpus gastritis activity at entry was moderate or severe in 50% and 55% of the OM only and OM triple groups, respectively. In the OM triple group, H. pylori was eradicated in 90 (88%) patients, and activity and inflammation decreased substantially in both the antrum and corpus (p < 0.001, baseline vs. two years). Atrophic gastritis also improved in the corpus (p < 0.001) but not in the antrum. In the 83 OM only patients with continuing infection, there was no change in antral and corpus gastritis activity or atrophy, but inflammation increased (p < 0.01).

### Extracellular and intracellular pattern recognition receptors cooperate in the recognition of Helicobacter pylori [^111bXGuh]. Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infects half of the world's population, thereby causing significant human morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms by which professional antigen-presenting cells recognize the microbe are poorly understood.

- **Methods**: Using dendritic cells (DCs) from TRIF, MyD88, TLR 2/4/7/9(-/-), and multiple double/triple/quadruple mutant mice, we characterized receptors and pathways mediating innate immune recognition of H pylori.

- **Results**: We identified a MyD88-dependent component of the DC activation program, which was induced by surface TLRs, with TLR2 and to a minor extent TLR4 being the exclusive surface receptors recognizing H pylori. A second MyD88-dependent component could be blocked in TLR2/4(-/-) DCs by inhibitors of endosomal acidification and depended on intracellular TLRs. We identified TLR9-mediated recognition of H pylori DNA as a principal H pylori-induced intracellular TLR pathway and further showed that H pylori RNA induces proinflammatory cytokines in a TLR-dependent manner. Microarray analysis showed complementary, redundant, and synergistic interactions between TLRs and additionally revealed gene expression patterns specific for individual TLRs, including a TLR2-dependent anti-inflammatory signature. A third component of the DC activation program was primarily composed of type I interferon-stimulated genes. This response was MyD88 and TRIF independent but was inducible by RIG-I-dependent recognition of H pylori RNA.

- **Conclusions**: These results provide novel comprehensive insights into the mechanisms of H pylori recognition.

### Helicobacter pylori [^1143Tt1Z]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is an important human pathogen responsible for most peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, and gastric malignancies. H. pylori has several unique features: it is highly adapted for gastric colonization, yet it produces clinical consequences in a small minority. Its genome is known, and it is the only bacterium strongly associated with cancer. H. pylori is therefore of great interest to clinicians and researchers from many often disparate disciplines. This review highlights recent advances in this rapidly changing field from various areas.

- **Recent findings**: The major contentious clinical issues relate to the synergistic gastrotoxic interactions of H. pylori with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and a possible association of H. pylori with atherosclerotic events. Accumulating evidence implicates genetic variation in the inflammatory response to H. pylori in the etiology of the increased risk of gastric cancer following H. pylori infection. Studies of pathogenesis have been aided by increasingly sophisticated murine models. The effects in gastric epithelial cells of two major virulence factors (genes within the cag pathogenicity island and the vacuolating cytotoxin, VacA) of H. pylori illustrate the complex network of cellular reactions activated by H. pylori. The metabolism of H. pylori is dependent on the availability of hydrogen.

- **Summary**: Basic science research into H. pylori continues to elucidate the mechanisms by which H. pylori infection causes disease. These findings have implications for the design of novel therapies and for improving treatment strategies.

### Helicobacter pylori eradication for the prevention of gastric neoplasia [^112H92xP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Gastric cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Individuals infected with Helicobacter pylori have a higher likelihood of developing gastric cancer than individuals who are not infected. Eradication of H. pylori in healthy asymptomatic individuals in the general population may reduce the incidence of gastric cancer, but the magnitude of this effect is unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of eradication of H. pylori in healthy asymptomatic individuals in the general population in reducing the incidence of gastric cancer.

- **Search methods**: We identified trials by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2013, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to December 2013), and EMBASE (1974 to December 2013). We handsearched reference lists from trials selected by electronic searching to identify further relevant trials. Additionally, we handsearched published abstracts from conference proceedings from the United European Gastroenterology Week (published in Gut) and Digestive Disease Week (published in Gastroenterology) between 2001 and 2013. We contacted members of the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Review Group and experts in the field, asking them to provide details of outstanding clinical trials and any relevant unpublished materials.

- **Selection criteria**: We analysed randomised controlled trials comparing at least one week of H. pylori therapy with placebo or no treatment in preventing subsequent development of gastric cancer in otherwise healthy and asymptomatic H. pylori-positive adults.

### And gastric acid: an intimate and reciprocal relationship [^1169oqgP]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is the main cause of gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric cancer. There are still unanswered questions related to the interaction between Hp and humans, such as what determines susceptibility for initial infection and the mechanisms for its carcinogenic effect. The initial infection seems to require temporary gastric hypoacidity. For Hp to survive in the gastric mucous layer, some acidity is necessary. Hp itself is probably not directly carcinogenic. Only when inducing oxyntic mucosal inflammation and atrophy with hypoacidity does Hp predispose individuals to gastric cancer. Gastrin most likely plays a central role in the Hp pathogenesis of duodenal ulcers and gastric cancer.
