## Question

Antiemetics appropriate for use with cirrhosis or liver failure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antiemetics are appropriate for use in cirrhosis or liver failure, including dosing, safety, and alternatives. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity of hepatic impairment. Then, I should verify first-line pharmacologic choices and their dose limits. Next, I will examine second-line agents and their cautions. After that, I need to check agents to avoid or use only with extreme caution. Finally, I will integrate nonpharmacologic strategies and monitoring considerations, and close with a practical, prioritized recommendation summary.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why antiemetic selection is different in cirrhosis. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis have altered pharmacokinetics, increased susceptibility to QT prolongation, constipation and encephalopathy, and polypharmacy that can worsen hepatic encephalopathy, so I need to ensure choices minimize these risks while still controlling nausea and vomiting [^2efdf7bf] [^d383f474].

> I will now examine first-line therapy. Ondansetron is consistently recommended as first-line in decompensated cirrhosis, but I should double-check the dose cap in severe hepatic impairment. The AASLD guidance advises a maximum of 8 mg/day in cirrhosis, and the FDA label specifies not exceeding 8 mg/day in severe hepatic impairment, which aligns with the same threshold, so I should confirm that daily totals remain at or below 8 mg and monitor for constipation and QT prolongation [^2efdf7bf] [^cc48e156] [^2104a738].

> Wait, let me verify alternatives within the 5-HT3 class. Granisetron and palonosetron are reasonable alternatives when ondansetron is unavailable or not tolerated, and importantly, their FDA labeling indicates no dose adjustment is required in chronic liver disease, which makes them attractive options in cirrhosis; I should still monitor for QT effects and drug interactions, but the lack of a hepatic dose change is clinically useful [^537881f9] [^aa9cab31] [^19d09caa].

> Next, I should review metoclopramide. A small RCT in cirrhosis with minimal encephalopathy showed benefit but also extrapyramidal effects, and AASLD recommends a 50% dose reduction in hepatic impairment; the FDA notes minimal hepatic metabolism and emphasizes renal clearance, so in patients with renal dysfunction I need to halve the dose again, keeping total daily doses conservative and limiting duration to avoid tardive dyskinesia [^2efdf7bf] [^2efdf7bf] [^f80bc270].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dopamine antagonists. Haloperidol and prochlorperazine can be considered for refractory cases, but I should confirm the cautions: haloperidol carries risks of QT prolongation, extrapyramidal symptoms, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and AASLD advises reduced dosing with ECG monitoring; prochlorperazine should be avoided in jaundice due to case reports of cholestatic injury, so I need to check bilirubin and liver enzyme patterns before choosing it [^2efdf7bf] [^d383f474].

> I need to ensure I flag agents that require extra caution or are best avoided. Cannabinoids may help nausea but have conflicting hepatotoxicity signals and can worsen encephalopathy; if considered at all, they should be used with caution, preferably as edibles rather than smoked, and only after discussing risks and local policy constraints [^83cf9081]. Aprepitant is labeled for use with caution in severe hepatic disease and has warnings about encephalopathy, so I should reserve it for select cases with careful monitoring rather than routine use in cirrhosis [^9cc2231b] [^ba14492e] [^251d023a].

> Let me consider nonpharmacologic strategies because they reduce medication burden. Ginger, guided imagery, relaxation, and acupuncture can be adjuncts; I should confirm platelet thresholds before acupuncture in thrombocytopenia and coordinate with palliative care for behavioral approaches, which AASLD and UK guidance endorse as part of comprehensive symptom management in decompensated cirrhosis [^2efdf7bf] [^e38f27c5].

> I should double-check precipitating causes of nausea before committing to long-term antiemetics. Electrolyte disturbances, adrenal insufficiency, medication effects, and reflux disease are common and treatable drivers in cirrhosis; addressing these can obviate the need for ongoing antiemetics and should be prioritized in the initial workup [^2efdf7bf] [^12ccc693].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety. For ondansetron and other QT-prolonging agents, I need to check baseline and periodic ECGs when risk factors exist, monitor for constipation and encephalopathy, and avoid combining multiple serotonergic or dopaminergic agents that increase adverse effects; in patients with renal impairment, I must further reduce metoclopramide dosing and extend intervals to mitigate accumulation [^d383f474] [^e01fae56].

> But wait, what if the patient is in acute liver failure rather than decompensated cirrhosis. In ALF, supportive care is emphasized and antiemetics are dosed per package insert with close monitoring; there is no high-credibility ALF-specific antiemetic guidance beyond general supportive principles, so I should keep regimens simple, avoid hepatotoxic combinations, and escalate care as indicated [^dba205d6].

> Let me synthesize a practical hierarchy. First-line is ondansetron up to 8 mg/day with attention to constipation and QT risk; alternatives include granisetron or palonosetron without hepatic dose adjustment; second-line is metoclopramide at reduced dose with renal function guiding further reductions; reserve haloperidol or prochlorperazine for refractory cases with ECG and hepatic injury screening; consider cannabinoids or aprepitant only in exceptional circumstances with informed consent and monitoring; and layer nonpharmacologic measures throughout [^2efdf7bf] [^cc48e156] [^537881f9] [^19d09caa] [^e01fae56].

> Finally, I should confirm that my plan aligns with guideline strength. AASLD's palliative care guidance for decompensated cirrhosis provides directive statements on ondansetron as first-line and metoclopramide with dose reduction, which gives these recommendations high applicability and credibility for this population, while FDA labeling supports the specific dose ceilings and hepatic cautions I have incorporated [^2efdf7bf] [^cc48e156] [^2104a738].

In cirrhosis or liver failure, **ondansetron is first-line** [^2efdf7bf] at ≤ 8 mg/day [^cc48e156] due to efficacy and a favorable safety profile, with monitoring for constipation and QT prolongation [^d383f474]. Metoclopramide is an alternative [^2efdf7bf] at 50% dose reduction [^e01fae56] and limited to short-term use because of extrapyramidal effects; avoid in renal impairment. Haloperidol or olanzapine can be used cautiously for refractory cases with ECG monitoring [^2efdf7bf]. Avoid prochlorperazine in jaundice [^2efdf7bf] and use cannabinoids only with caution given limited cirrhosis-specific data [^83cf9081]. Always address reversible causes and monitor for adverse effects, especially QT prolongation and CNS effects [^2efdf7bf].

## Pharmacokinetic considerations in cirrhosis

Cirrhosis alters drug metabolism and clearance, increasing toxicity risk; therefore, **dose adjustments and careful monitoring are essential** [^5e11da64].

- **Reduced hepatic metabolism**: Decreased CYP activity increases drug exposure.
- **Altered volume of distribution**: Increased risk of drug accumulation.
- **Renal impairment**: Common in cirrhosis, affecting excretion and necessitating dose adjustments [^notfound].

| Cannabinoids | Limited evidence | Use cautiously; limited data [^83cf9081] | - Psychosis <br/> - Encephalopathy [^83cf9081] |

---

## Antiemetics to avoid or use with caution

- **Prochlorperazine**: Avoid in jaundice due to cholestatic injury risk [^2efdf7bf].
- **Cannabinoids**: Limited cirrhosis-specific data; use cautiously [^83cf9081].
- **Aprepitant**: Use with caution in severe hepatic impairment [^9cc2231b] [^ba14492e].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting recommendations

- **Ondansetron**: Effective and safe at ≤ 8 mg/day in severe hepatic impairment [^cc48e156] [^2efdf7bf].
- **Metoclopramide**: Effective but limited by extrapyramidal effects; use short-term with dose reduction [^2efdf7bf] [^e01fae56].
- **Haloperidol/olanzapine**: Options for refractory cases with careful monitoring [^2efdf7bf].

---

## Potential adverse effects and monitoring strategies

- **QT prolongation**: Monitor ECG with ondansetron, haloperidol, and olanzapine [^d383f474].
- **Extrapyramidal symptoms**: Monitor with metoclopramide and haloperidol [^d383f474].
- **CNS effects**: Monitor sedation and confusion, especially in hepatic encephalopathy [^d383f474].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological measures can reduce medication burden and should be considered alongside drug therapy [^2efdf7bf]. Options include **dietary modifications** (small, frequent meals; avoid triggers), **behavioral therapies** (relaxation, guided imagery, acupuncture), and **addressing reversible causes** (treat reflux, electrolyte disturbances, infections) [^2efdf7bf].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line**: Ondansetron ≤ 8 mg/day with monitoring [^cc48e156] [^2efdf7bf].
- **Alternative**: Metoclopramide at 50% dose, short-term only [^2efdf7bf] [^e01fae56].
- **Refractory**: Haloperidol or olanzapine with ECG monitoring [^2efdf7bf].
- **Avoid**: Prochlorperazine in jaundice; use cannabinoids cautiously [^2efdf7bf] [^83cf9081].

---

Ondansetron is **first-line** for nausea in cirrhosis or liver failure, with metoclopramide as an alternative at reduced dose; haloperidol or olanzapine are options for refractory cases. Always monitor for adverse effects and address reversible causes.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^2efdf7bf]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

AASLD — nausea and vomiting management in cirrhosis outlines nonpharmacological and pharmacological options. Nonpharmacological approaches can include behavioral avoidance, removal of triggering medications, treatment of underlying physiological causes, use of ginger, guided imagery or relaxation techniques, and acupuncture. First-line pharmacotherapy for nausea and vomiting in patients with cirrhosis may include a trial of a histamine H2 antagonist or proton pump inhibitor in patients with suspected reflux-associated nausea. Ondansetron can be used in patients with liver impairment at a dose of up to 8 mg/d, with monitoring for constipation and QT prolongation. In a small RCT in cirrhosis with mild encephalopathy, metoclopramide (up to 60 mg daily) versus placebo was studied over a period of 2 weeks; although metoclopramide reduced nausea and heartburn, extrapyramidal side effects limit long-term use and a 50% dose reduction is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. Other options include olanzapine, haloperidol, or prochlorperazine, but prochlorperazine should be avoided in jaundice given case reports of cholestatic liver injury.

AASLD — cannabinoids for nausea and vomiting in decompensated cirrhosis (DC) emphasizes limited evidence and cautions. Cannabinoids are another potential treatment for nausea and vomiting, and one meta-analysis found cannabinoids were associated with a reduction of nausea and vomiting of > 50%, although data in cirrhosis are limited. Adverse effects in the general population include dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, fatigue, somnolence, euphoria, vomiting, disorientation, drowsiness, confusion, loss of balance, and hallucination. Observational studies report both associations with accelerated hepatic fibrosis, encephalopathy, and ascites in chronic liver disease due to HCV and fatty liver disease, and other studies including two meta-analyses did not find a significant association between cannabis and hepatic fibrosis. Trials have generally excluded patients with cirrhosis; thus, cannabinoids should be used with caution and with attention to institutional protocols for its use, and edible formulations are favored over inhaled because of the potential infectious and respiratory effects of smoking.

Idiosyncratic DILI — supportive and symptomatic interventions: For pain control, APAP analgesics are suggested for mild to moderate pain with 2 g maximum per day in divided doses. For nausea, antiemetics for moderate nausea/vomiting are dosed per package insert. For pruritus, ursodeoxycholic acid can be given at 10–15 mg/kg in divided doses with prospective efficacy data lacking; likely safe. Hospitalization is appropriate for dehydrated, coagulopathic, encephalopathic patients, with transfer to a transplant center if acute liver failure (ALF) develops.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug harms in cirrhosis — "NSAIDs are among the most commonly inappropriately used medications in patients with cirrhosis", yet "Multiple studies demonstrate the deleterious impact of NSAIDs in patients with cirrhosis attributable to risk of renal injury, bleeding, and ascites". In one trial, "23 patients with cirrhosis" receiving "five doses of 500 mg of naproxen (vs. placebo or celecoxib)" had adverse physiologic effects, and consequently "systemic NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis". Patients should also be informed that other products "may include APAP, which counts toward the daily limit".

Table 6 — Palliative symptom management in decompensated cirrhosis outlines options for dyspnea, muscle cramps, pruritus, and nausea/vomiting. For dyspnea, nonpharmacotherapies include managing reversible causes, bedside fans, supplemental oxygen therapy, mindfulness-based practices, paracentesis, thoracentesis, and placement of drains in hospice settings; pharmacotherapies note that opioids can be used cautiously in select cases at the end of life with an example starting dose of i.v. hydromorphone 0.2 mg every 3 h as needed, and anxiolytics can be considered for dyspnea‑associated anxiety. For muscle cramps, taurine (2–3 g daily), vitamin E (300 mg three times a day), and baclofen (5–10 mg three times a day) are listed. For pruritus, cholestyramine (4 g/d, titrated to 16 g/d if needed) and sertraline (25 mg/d, titrated to 75–100 mg if needed) are options; RIF and naltrexone may improve pruritus but have limited use in palliative treatment of patients with DC, and antihistamines may help pruritus‑associated sleep disturbance given their sedating properties. For nausea and vomiting, antacids (if contributing reflux) are included; ondansetron, up to 8 mg/d is preferred; metoclopramide up to 60 mg/d is noted, with alternatives such as prochlorperazine or haloperidol depending on goals of care; acupuncture is mentioned with caution if platelets < 50,000.

Opioid selection and safety in cirrhosis — when opioids are required, "prophylactic medications should be considered proactively to prevent constipation and encephalopathy (e.g., lactulose)", and "codeine, morphine, and tramadol should generally be avoided in patients with cirrhosis". "Tramadol is often inappropriately selected for first-line use in patients with cirrhosis because of the perception that it is not an opioid", yet it "has variable pharmacokinetics across persons with cirrhosis… and has notably unpredictable side effects, including hypoglycemia". For transdermal fentanyl, "The patch comes in set doses with the lowest option of a 12-μg/h patch, which may be too high for patients with cirrhosis", and "cachexia is a relative contraindication to transdermal fentanyl", while "methadone should only be used in consultation with a specialist". "First-line opioids for patients with cirrhosis generally include low-dose hydromorphone (e.g., 1 mg p.o. or 0.4 mg i.v.) or oxycodone (e.g., 2.5 mg p.o.) with extended dosing intervals". Initiation should follow best practices: "Prescribing clinicians should adhere to best practices for risk assessment, setting patient expectations, and monitoring when starting opioids", "first-line treatment should be a 7-day supply of low-dose, short-acting opioids", and "Patients require close follow-up", with risk factors assessed such as "past opioid use disorder" and "concurrent benzodiazepine use" or other prescriptions in "prescription drug monitoring program data".

### Metoclopramide hydrochloride (metoclopramide) [^e01fae56]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

USE IN PATIENTS WITH RENAL OR HEPATIC IMPAIRMENT

Since metoclopramide is excreted principally through the kidneys, in those patients whose creatinine clearance is below 40 mL/min, therapy should be initiated at approximately one-half the recommended dosage. Depending upon clinical efficacy and safety considerations, the dosage may be increased or decreased as appropriate.

See section for information regarding dialysis. OVERDOSAGE

Metoclopramide undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism, except for simple conjugation. Its safe use has been described in patients with advanced liver disease whose renal function was normal.

Low credibility. 7 Therapy should be directed toward improving mental status via bowel cleansing with lactulose orally or with enemas. One randomized trial demonstrated that diets with normal protein content can be followed safely during episodic hepatic encephalopathy caused by cirrhosis, and that protein restriction has no beneficial effect during such episodes. 11In patients who are refractory to lactulose alone, neomycin can be added.
8. These guidelines also suggest that the most effective pharmacotherapy is propranolol at a dosage of 40 mg twice daily, increasing to 80 mg twice daily if necessary. 9If propranolol is contraindicated or not tolerated, isosorbide mononitrate at a dosage of 20 mg twice daily is the treatment of choice. 9Studies conducted since these guidelines have titrated the dosage of propranolol based on a reduction of the pulse rate by 25 percent. 15, 16.

9 This treatment option should be performed in medical centers with particular expertise. TIPS has been shown to reduce portal hypertension and can be effective in converting patients with diuretic-resistant ascites to diuretic-sensitive ascites, as well as reducing gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with refractory variceal hemorrhage. Evidence regarding whether or not TIPS improves survival is conflicting. 3 Compared with large-volume paracentesis plus albumin, TIPS improves survival without liver transplantation in patients with refractory or recidivant ascites.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and potentially nephrotoxic medications should be avoided. One controlled trial demonstrated a substantial improvement in renal plasma f low, glomerular filtration rate, and urinary sodium excretion in patients with type 1 hepatorenal syndrome after 20 days of treatment with oral midodrine and parenteral octreotide compared with the use of nonpressor dose dopamine.

### Evidence and consensus recommendations for the pharmacological management of pain in India [^69afe5b8]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Liver failure

Deciding analgesic therapy for patients with hepatic impairment can be a challenge, since most analgesics undergo hepatic metabolism. Cirrhosis is the most prevalent manifestation of liver disease, and it may be caused due to excessive alcohol intake, hepatitis infection or drug-induced toxicity. Since liver is the main site of metabolism for paracetamol, NSAIDs and opioids such as morphine, its dysfunction may lead to increased blood levels of these drugs, particularly those that are primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. On the contrary, changes in CYP enzymes may result in decreased efficacy of codeine and tramadol, which undergo biotransformation to active metabolites. Thus, a thorough understanding of the pharmacokinetic profile of analgesics may help in deciding the appropriate pharmacotherapy for patients with liver dysfunction. For instance, although paracetamol undergoes metabolic conversion to a hepatotoxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, clinically significant toxicity is observed only at large doses, and small doses of this drug may appear to be safe in such patients. Dose adjustment should be considered while administering NSAIDs and opioids to patients with hepatic impairment.

Disease-specific treatment recommendations are presented in the Supplementary materials section.

In patients with cirrhosis and chronic liver disease, acute-on-chronic liver failure is emerging as a major cause of mortality. These guidelines indicate the preferred approach to the management of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology. The scientific evidence for these guidelines was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process. In instances where the evidence was not appropriate for Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation, but there was consensus of significant clinical merit, key concept statements were developed using expert consensus. These guidelines are meant to be broadly applicable and should be viewed as the preferred, but not only, approach to clinical scenarios.

Purpose

When one considers the significant role of the liver in medication absorption and metabolism, clinicians must appreciate the important ramifications for medication dosing and monitoring in patients with cirrhosis. For many medications, dose adjustments may be necessary to minimize toxicities or avoid adverse effects from drug accumulation. Clinicians could be well served if they can understand in some detail how pharmacokinetic properties are altered in cirrhosis.

Methods

A PubMed search of the English medical literature starting with 1980 using keywords cirrhosis, pain management, and analgesics was performed, and additional papers were found using references from the first round of papers.

Findings

Patients with cirrhosis often have significant reductions in first-pass metabolism, altered volumes of distribution, and marked reductions in both renal and hepatic elimination of drugs. These factors may contribute to much higher levels of drug exposure compared to the general population. In terms of drug dosing, FDA labeling is often ambiguous and even incongruous with observed pharmacokinetic changes.

Implications

This article may provide guidance for clinicians to optimize pain management in people living with cirrhosis.

Key Message

Current FDA labeling for dosing analgesic drugs in patients with cirrhosis is either vague or not consistent with findings from newer pharmacokinetic research. With this review, we hope to provide insight and guidance to clinicians on how to dose-adjust medications commonly utilized in pain management in these patients.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^6bf39e2f]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD Practice Guidance — anticoagulation and hemostasis in cirrhosis/ACLF reports that a nonblinded, single-center randomized controlled trial found prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin decreased venous thromboembolism risk with relative risk, 0.05; p = 0.048 without increasing mortality or bleeding, and an observational comparison of pharmacologic versus mechanical prophylaxis reported no difference in mortality or bleeding. Although concerns about anticoagulation and gastrointestinal bleeding exist, outcomes after upper GI bleeding were associated with the degree of multiorgan failure and comorbidity but not receipt of anticoagulation itself. Guidance statements specify that INR should not be used to gauge bleeding risk among patients with cirrhosis/ACLF, that global tests of hemostasis better capture general hemostatic status but have not been clinically validated, and that in ACLF with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50), decisions regarding safety of systemic anticoagulation should be made on a case-by-case basis.

### AGA clinical practice update on pregnancy-related gastrointestinal and liver disease: expert review [^a297f0fa]. Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update is to review the available published evidence and expert advice regarding the clinical management of patients with pregnancy-related gastrointestinal and liver disease.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the Clinical Practice Updates Committee and external peer review through the standard procedures of Gastroenterology. This article provides practical advice for the management of pregnant patients with gastrointestinal and liver disease based on the best available published evidence. The Best Practice Advice statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Because formal systematic reviews were not performed, these Best Practice Advice statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: To optimize gastrointestinal and liver disease before pregnancy, preconception and contraceptive care counseling by a multidisciplinary team should be encouraged for reproductive-aged persons who desire to become pregnant. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Procedures, medications, and other interventions to optimize maternal health should not be withheld solely because a patient is pregnant and should be individualized after an assessment of the risks and benefits. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Coordination of birth for a pregnant patient with complex inflammatory bowel disease, advanced cirrhosis, or a liver transplant should be managed by a multidisciplinary team, preferably in a tertiary care center. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Early treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may reduce progression to hyperemesis gravidarum. In addition to standard diet and lifestyle measures, stepwise treatment consists of symptom control with vitamin B6 and doxylamine, hydration, and adequate nutrition; ondansetron, metoclopramide, promethazine, and intravenous glucocorticoids may be required in moderate to severe cases. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Constipation in pregnant persons may result from hormonal, medication-related, and physiological changes. Treatment options include dietary fiber, lactulose, and polyethylene glycol-based laxatives. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Elective endoscopic procedures should be deferred until the postpartum period, whereas nonemergent but necessary procedures should ideally be performed in the second trimester. Pregnant patients with cirrhosis should undergo evaluation for, and treatment of, esophageal varices; upper endoscopy is suggested in the second trimester (if not performed within 1 year before conception) to guide consideration of nonselective β-blocker therapy or endoscopic variceal ligation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: In patients with inflammatory bowel disease, clinical remission before conception, during pregnancy, and in the postpartum period is essential for improving outcomes of pregnancy. Biologic agents should be continued throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period; use of methotrexate, thalidomide, and ozanimod must be stopped at least 6 months before conception. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography during pregnancy may be performed for urgent indications, such as choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, and some cases of gallstone pancreatitis. Ideally, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography should be performed during the second trimester, but if deferring the procedure may be detrimental to the health of the patient and fetus, a multidisciplinary team should be convened to decide on the advisability of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Cholecystectomy is safe during pregnancy; a laparoscopic approach is the standard of care regardless of trimester, but ideally in the second trimester. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: The diagnosis of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is based on a serum bile acid level > 10 μmol/L in the setting of pruritus, typically during the second or third trimester. Treatment should be offered with oral ursodeoxycholic acid in a total daily dose of 10–15 mg/kg. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Management of liver diseases unique to pregnancy, such as pre-eclampsia; hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets syndrome; and acute fatty liver of pregnancy requires planning for delivery and timely evaluation for possible liver transplantation. Daily aspirin prophylaxis for patients at risk for pre-eclampsia or hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets syndrome is advised beginning at week 12 of gestation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: In patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, serum hepatitis B virus DNA and liver biochemical test levels should be ordered. Patients not on treatment but with a serum hepatitis B virus DNA level > 200,000 IU/mL during the third trimester of pregnancy should be considered for treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: In patients on immunosuppressive therapy for chronic liver diseases or after liver transplantation, therapy should be continued at the lowest effective dose during pregnancy. Mycophenolate mofetil should not be administered during pregnancy.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^6abb20ac]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Liver failure and death has been reported in cancer patients receiving concurrent medications, including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear.

### 5-HT (3)-receptor antagonists for the treatment of nausea and vomiting: a reappraisal of their side-effect profile [^9acde85e]. The Oncologist (2002). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting can cause considerable distress and discomfort to patients undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery. Several classes of antiemetic agents exist to combat these side effects, though the 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonists have become the first-line treatment choice for many cancer patients and are considered the "gold standard" in antiemetic therapy. Compared with the older generation antiemetic drugs, 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonists are effective, well tolerated, and associated with few side effects. However, emerging differences among these agents suggest that the incidence and/or intensity of adverse events should not be regarded as a class effect. The side-effect profile of any supportive care therapy is particularly important in certain subgroups of patients, including pediatric patients and the elderly, as well as those suffering comorbid conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and renal or hepatic impairment. Indeed, dolasetron is associated with cardiovascular effects, and thus, should be used with extreme caution in patients who suffer from or may develop prolongation of cardiac conduction intervals. Ondansetron, on the other hand, is associated with a greater incidence of central nervous system side effects than either dolasetron or ondansetron, and pharmacokinetic parameters are affected in patients with hepatic impairment, thereby requiring dose adjustments. Clinicians are encouraged to evaluate patients on an individual basis when choosing which 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonist to prescribe.

CHALLENGES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC PAIN

Cirrhosis presents unique challenges in pain management. First, consensus is lacking for the management of pain, and pharmacologic options are limited. There are recommendations to limit the use of acetaminophen (≤ 2 g per day) and avoid nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)/opioids. If opioids are to be considered, expert opinion recommends weak opioids such as tramadol or hydromorphone for nociceptive pain and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or gabapentin for neuropathic pain. Efficacy data, however, are limited.

Second, virtually any pharmacologic intervention can be difficult and dangerous for patients with cirrhosis. For example, NSAIDs are used by 10%–30% of patients with cirrhosis, increasing the risk of ascites, kidney injury, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Even short‐term use of NSAIDs can be deleterious, as just five doses of 500 mg of naproxen has been correlated with decreased kidney function, decreased response to furosemide, and inhibited platelet aggregation and thromboxane B 2 production in patients with cirrhosis. Prescription rates for gabapentin have also increased severalfold. Both opioids and gabapentinoids are associated with unique harms in cirrhosis, including worse health‐related quality of life (HRQOL)and increased risk of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a frequent complication of cirrhosis that markedly increases mortality. The mechanisms for the harms of psychoactive medications are multifold. First, cirrhosis pushes toxins from the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. ammonia) that would be normally detoxified by the liver into the bloodstream. These toxins impact brain and muscle function, leading to depression, sleep disturbance, impaired physical function, and poor HRQOL. These toxins lead to a dominant inhibitory tone in the brain that is exacerbated by drugs like gabapentin and benzodiazepines. Second, because opioids prolong intestinal transit time, a key determinant of toxin translocation from the gut, increased toxin load results. Despite the fact that opioids are not thought to be efficacious in chronic noncancer painand are associated with significant side effects, as many as half of patients with cirrhosis are prescribed opioids. Opioid prescription occurs more frequently in cirrhosis than in other chronic diseasesand is associated with a higher risk of opioid‐related toxicity and overdose in patients with liver disease. Furthermore, opioids are often prescribed with benzodiazepines, compounding the risk of adverse events, including fallsand potential overdose deaths. Thus, it is imperative to select pain management modalities to improve pain control while avoiding serious complications (Figure 1). To do so, we need to better understand and characterize the mechanistic drivers of pain in cirrhosis.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^d0b1b0bb]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The most common adverse reactions reported in 4 trials in adults for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (primarily cyclophosphamide-based regimens) are shown in Table 3.

Table 3: Most Common Adverse Reactions in Adultsa for the Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated With Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy [Primarily Cyclophosphamide-based Regimens]

a Reported in greater than or equal to 5% of patients treated with ondansetron and at a rate that exceeded placebo.

Less Common Adverse Reactions

Central Nervous System: Extrapyramidal reactions (less than 1% of patients).

Hepatic: Aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alanine transaminase (ALT) values exceeded twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of 723 patients receiving ondansetron and cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in U.S. clinical trials. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes is unclear.

Liver failure and death has been reported in cancer patients receiving concurrent medications, including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear.

Norepinephrine and other vasoconstrictors — comparative effectiveness and practical use: studies comparing norepinephrine with terlipressin for the treatment of HRS1 showed noninferiority of norepinephrine in reversing HRS1, and this was confirmed by meta-analysis. A recent non-ICU study used low-dose norepinephrine (starting dose: 5 μg/min, maximum dose: 10 μg/min) with cardiac monitoring to reach an MAP > 10 mm hg above baseline value and achieved a complete response in six out of 20 patients with a partial response in three additional patients. Another oral vasoconstrictor, midodrine (dosed 7.5–15 mg orally three times daily) combined with octreotide is inferior to a continuous infusion of terlipressin as a treatment for HRS1 but can be safely used in a monitored setting.

### Metoclopramide hydrochloride [^f80bc270]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The initial route of administration should be determined by the severity of the presenting symptoms. If only the earliest manifestations of diabetic gastric stasis are present, oral administration of metoclopramide may be initiated. However, if severe symptoms are present, therapy should begin with metoclopramide injection (consult labeling of the injection prior to initiating parenteral administration).

Administration of metoclopramide injection up to 10 days may be required before symptoms subside at which time oral administration may be instituted. Since diabetic gastric stasis is frequently recurrent, metoclopramide therapy should be reinstituted at the earliest manifestation.

USE IN PATIENTS WITH RENAL OR HEPATIC IMPAIRMENT

Since metoclopramide is excreted principally through the kidneys, in those patients whose creatinine clearance is below 40 mL/min, therapy should be initiated at approximately one half the recommended dosage. Depending upon clinical efficacy and safety considerations, the dosage may be increased or decreased as appropriate.

See OVERDOSAGE section for information regarding dialysis.

Metoclopramide undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism, except for simple conjugation. Its safe use has been described in patients with advanced liver disease whose renal function was normal.

Short-acting, orally administered opioids — codeine (alone or in combination with APAP or ASA) — initial oral dosing in opioid-naïve adults is 15 to 30 mg every 4 to 6 hr, and for combination products the Maximum APAP dose: 4000 mg/d (2000 mg/d in chronic alcoholics or in hepatic impairment). Pharmacokinetics are Analgesic Onset (min): 15 to 30, Peak (min): 30 to 60, Duration (hr): 4 to 6, and t½ (hr): ~3. In special populations: Elderly or debilitated: Use with caution; Hepatic dysfunction: Conversion to active metabolite (morphine) may be reduced in patients with cirrhosis; avoid use in patients with liver disease; and Renal dysfunction: Use lower dosage or an alternative analgesic. Other considerations note that Codeine may be less effective in patients with decreased CYP-2D6 activity (due to poor CYP-2D6 metabolism or CYP-2D6 inhibiting drugs) because of decreased conversion to the active metabolite, morphine, and that CYP-2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers can have extensive conversion to morphine with increase in opioid-mediated effects.

Symptoms and problems addressed by PC

Patients with DC often have general symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue and breathlessness frequently overlooked due to a focus on more liver specific symptoms such as itch, ascites and encephalopathy. Addressing symptoms has a clear impact on quality of life. In addition, there are often broader psychosocial issues to address such as emotional support, dealing with carer burden and financial aspects.

There is often uncertainty about the safety of medication prescribing in patients with DC, but this should not lead to inadequate management of patients' symptoms. See table 3 for a summary of how to manage common symptoms in patients with DC. The British Association for the Study of the Liver (BASL) has further guidance on anticipatory prescribing at the end of life.

Table 3
Managing symptoms in advanced liver disease

Patients who may be suitable for PC should be discussed in a multidisciplinary meeting with representatives from PC, hepatology/gastroenterology (including specialist nurses) and other Allied Health Practitioners (AHPs) such as dieticians and alcohol care teams. Outcomes should be clearly communicated to the community team. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss advance care plans, emergency healthcare plans and resuscitation status, and should be added to the PC register. Consider signposting patients and families to additional practical support such as social prescribers, accessible through primary care.

Multidisciplinary care

Patients with DC have high rates of hospital admissions, long lengths of stay, high complication rates and significant healthcare costs. Liver specialist nurse led clinics can play an important role in admission avoidance and facilitating early discharge. Early postdischarge clinics (within 2 weeks of patient discharge) and urgent nurse-led liver clinics can facilitate diuretic titration, early detection of HE, symptom management and offer support to patients and carers. If admission is required, they can ensure early specialist input, which is crucial in improving outcomes for patients admitted with decompensation.

Nurse-led day case paracentesis services significantly reduce emergency admission rates, lower costs and improve outcomes and patient experience. There should be clear referral pathways in place via the gastroenterology/hepatology team to ensure patients are appropriate for the service. Patients should be given information on when and who to contact when symptoms (such as encephalopathy) deteriorate, or their ascites accumulates.

The aim should be to develop a service with an integrated MDT including dieticians, physiotherapists, pharmacists, PC nurse specialists and alcohol care teams to support a holistic approach to outpatient management of advanced liver disease.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Atovaquone absorption may be reduced in patients with diarrhea or vomiting. If used in patients who are vomiting, parasitemia should be closely monitored and the use of an antiemetic considered. In patients with severe or persistent diarrhea or vomiting, alternative antimalarial therapy may be required. (5.1)
In mixed P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infection, P. vivax relapse occurred commonly when patients were treated with MALARONE alone. (5.2)
In the event of recrudescent P. falciparum infections after treatment or prophylaxis failure, patients should be treated with a different blood schizonticide. (5.2)
Elevated liver laboratory tests and cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation have been reported with prophylactic use. (5.3)
MALARONE has not been evaluated for the treatment of cerebral malaria or other severe manifestations of complicated malaria. Patients with severe malaria are not candidates for oral therapy. (5.4)

5.1 Vomiting and Diarrhea

Absorption of atovaquone may be reduced in patients with diarrhea or vomiting. If MALARONE is used in patients who are vomiting, parasitemia should be closely monitored and the use of an antiemetic considered. [See Dosage and Administration (2).] Vomiting occurred in up to 19% of pediatric patients given treatment doses of MALARONE. In the controlled clinical trials, 15.3% of adults received an antiemetic when they received atovaquone/proguanil and 98.3% of these patients were successfully treated. In patients with severe or persistent diarrhea or vomiting, alternative antimalarial therapy may be required.

5.2 Relapse of Infection

In mixed P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections, P. vivax parasite relapse occurred commonly when patients were treated with MALARONE alone.

In the event of recrudescent P. falciparum infections after treatment with MALARONE or failure of chemoprophylaxis with MALARONE, patients should be treated with a different blood schizonticide.

5.3 Hepatotoxicity

Elevated liver laboratory tests and cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation have been reported with prophylactic use of MALARONE.

5.4 Severe or Complicated Malaria

MALARONE has not been evaluated for the treatment of cerebral malaria or other severe manifestations of complicated malaria, including hyperparasitemia, pulmonary edema, or renal failure. Patients with severe malaria are not candidates for oral therapy.

### Early acetaminophen administration and mortality outcomes in critically ill patients with cirrhosis: a retrospective analysis from the MIMIC-IV database [^26919e4f]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The incidence of cirrhosis and mortality rates have continued to rise globally. Patients with cirrhosis frequently require hospitalization and ICU admission due to complications like decompensation and extrahepatic organ failure, which contribute to high short-term mortality and substantial healthcare cost. Acetaminophen is commonly used in the ICU for its analgesic and antipyretic effects. Controlled clinical trials have shown that short-term use of low-dose APAP is safe for patients with compensated cirrhosis. Additionally, a large systematic review found that APAP-induced hepatotoxicity predominantly results from accidental overdose, suggesting that standard APAP dosing may be feasible in cirrhotic patients. However, due to safety concerns, conducting clinical trials to definitively assess whether early APAP use is beneficial or harmful in cirrhotic patients remains unlikely. Therefore, we utilized real-world data to explore the relationship between early APAP use and clinical outcomes in patients with cirrhosis.

It is well-established that APAP undergoes first-pass metabolism in the liver. This process can result in the depletion of glutathione (GSH), mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and activation of apoptotic pathways, ultimately exacerbating liver tissue damage. The potential hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen, which may lead to primitive biliary cholangitis and liver failure, underscores its harmful effects in critically ill cirrhotic patients. Impaired liver function in cirrhosis reduces APAP detoxification, increasing its toxicity risk. Early APAP use was identified as an independent risk factor for mortality in critically ill cirrhotic patients, underscoring the need for cautious use after ICU admission. Markers such as lactate and SIRS may help predict 28-day mortality when used alongside APAP status. Impaired bacterial clearance in cirrhotic patients heightened their susceptibility to SIRS, which exacerbates liver function deterioration and consequently leads to higher mortality. Moreover, multiple large-scale trials have identified promising therapeutic strategies for temperature management in critically ill patients, and our results suggested that temperature management might be a promising target.

### Tolvaptan versus other interventions for hyponatraemia in people with cirrhosis [^586dbc0a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

We will obtain the risk of bias judgements for each domain using the algorithm in the RoB 2 Excel tool (available at www.riskofbias.info), namely 'low' risk of bias, 'high' risk of bias, or 'some concerns'. We will support our answers to the signalling questions and our risk of bias judgements by providing justifications. The overall risk of bias for the outcome result will be the least favourable assessment across the five bias domains. Both the proposed domain‐level and overall risk of bias judgements may be overridden by the review authors, with justification, and we will document this appropriately.

Measures of treatment effect

We will follow the guidance outlined in Chapter 6 and Chapter 10 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

Whenever possible, we will analyse dichotomous outcomes, such as all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, and non‐serious adverse events, with risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

When survival data (i.e. time‐to‐event) are available, but mortality data are not, and they cannot be obtained from the survival data, we will use hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs.

When trials report the number of adverse events (serious or those considered non‐serious) in the experimental and control groups of the trials, we will calculate the rate ratio based on the total number of events in the two groups using a formula in Excel as described in Chapter 6 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. In RevMan, we will define the analysis with contrast‐level type of data, the inverse variance statistical method, and the rate ratio effect measure with 95% CI. Then, we will add the natural logarithm (ln) of the rate ratio obtained from the formula, along with the corresponding standard error (SE), into RevMan for the analysis. We will present a table with each type of adverse event separately.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^af0d92fc]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD practice guidance — purpose and scope states that there are approximately 800,000 hospitalizations a year for cirrhosis complications in the United States, and 7%–8% of these patients require intensive care at an estimated cost of $2 billion but without standardized intensive care protocols. Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a term often applied to patients with chronic liver disease with or without cirrhosis with hepatic and extrahepatic organ failures, most of whom require intensive care, and the document provides guidance and a data-supported approach for the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of patients with cirrhosis and ACLF as well as cirrhosis and critical illness; it differs from the AASLD Guidelines in that it was developed by consensus of an expert panel with oversight provided by the AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee because there are an insufficient number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) available to support meaningful systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The introduction describes traditional stages of cirrhosis as a compensated phase with no complications and a decompensated phase that manifests with complications of portal hypertension, notes that there is a more rapid phase, and states that in cirrhosis precipitating events leading to hepatic and extrahepatic organ failures (e.g., neurologic, respiratory, circulatory, renal) may be liver related or non–liver related (e.g., surgery), and often the precipitant is not identified.
