## Question

Antibiotic Treatment of an uncomplicated foot ulcer in a patient with diabetes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about antibiotic treatment of an uncomplicated diabetic foot ulcer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "uncomplicated" in this context. Then, I should verify whether antibiotics are indicated at all for an uninfected ulcer. Next, I will review how to diagnose infection clinically and when to obtain cultures. After that, I need to consider empiric antibiotic choices if infection is present, including spectrum, route, and duration. Finally, I should confirm follow-up, reassessment triggers, and the role of adjunctive measures like off-loading and debridement, and I will double-check any conflicting statements about duration before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misapply guidance. By "uncomplicated", I should mean a diabetic foot ulcer without clinical infection, ischemia, exposed bone, or systemic toxicity; in other words, a neuropathic ulcer with intact protective sensation, no spreading cellulitis, no purulence, and no systemic signs, which aligns with the IWGDF/IDSA framework for classifying infection severity and distinguishing uninfected from infected ulcers [^112VzzR1] [^1152jYcX].

> Wait, let me verify the core principle before discussing antibiotics. I need to ensure I'm not conflating colonization with infection. The IWGDF/IDSA best practice statements are explicit: do not treat clinically uninfected foot ulcers with systemic or local antibiotics to prevent infection or promote healing, because antibiotics do not improve healing in uninfected ulcers and risk collateral damage and resistance [^11569Y16] [^1165nJXy] [^113CkSYW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm how infection is diagnosed. Infection is a clinical diagnosis based on local signs such as erythema, warmth, swelling/induration, tenderness, or purulence, and systemic features like fever or leukocytosis; in patients with neuropathy, signs may be blunted, so I need to examine carefully and consider serum inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR, or PCT) if the exam is equivocal, while remembering that superficial swabs are discouraged due to contaminants and that deep tissue sampling is preferred when infection is suspected [^1152jYcX] [^112XXrgA] [^113FymoF].

> I should double-check the role of cultures. If infection is present, obtain a post-debridement tissue specimen by curettage or biopsy for culture and susceptibility to guide definitive therapy; in mild, acute, previously untreated cases, empiric therapy without culture may be reasonable, but I need to ensure I narrow therapy once results return to support stewardship [^113FymoF] [^1113RHL3].

> Now, if infection is confirmed, I will examine empiric therapy choices. For a mild soft-tissue diabetic foot infection without recent antibiotics in a temperate region, target aerobic gram-positive pathogens only: beta-hemolytic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus, adding MRSA coverage if risk factors exist or local prevalence is high; avoid empiric gram-negative or anaerobic coverage unless the clinical picture suggests otherwise, and reserve broader regimens for moderate to severe infections or specific risk contexts [^117KPuJz] [^111bZUfh] [^111DaZp7].

> Let me think about route and duration, and I should verify conflicting statements. Most mild infections can be treated with highly bioavailable oral agents; IV therapy is reserved for severe infections or when oral therapy is not feasible. Standard duration for soft-tissue infection is 1–2 weeks, with extension to 3–4 weeks if the infection is extensive, resolving slowly, or if there is severe PAD; I initially recalled a suggestion of 2–3 weeks for moderate infections, but wait, I should correct that — current IWGDF/IDSA guidance emphasizes 1–2 weeks for soft-tissue DFI and allows extension only when clinically justified, not a routine 2–3 weeks for moderate disease [^115MRB6P] [^116Nf3FQ] [^116W5KuF] [^112yXhgL].

> Next, I should review definitive therapy and follow-up. Tailor antibiotics to culture and susceptibility results and the clinical response; reassess within 48–72 hours to ensure improvement, and if there is no response after 4 weeks of apparently appropriate therapy, re-evaluate the diagnosis, consider imaging for occult abscess or osteomyelitis, and reconsider alternative diagnoses or source control issues [^115gaEyS] [^116Cx7Yh].

> But wait, what if osteomyelitis is suspected? I need to check the diagnostic approach. Use probe-to-bone, plain radiographs, and inflammatory markers as initial tests; if suspicion remains high, obtain MRI and consider bone biopsy for culture and histology, because soft-tissue cultures poorly predict bone pathogens; if osteomyelitis is confirmed, treatment duration is substantially longer — about 3 weeks after minor amputation with negative margins versus 6 weeks without bone resection — and decisions about surgery versus antibiotics alone should be individualized based on anatomy, perfusion, and response [^1149UEae] [^116ssncR] [^112oKzwF].

> I will now examine adjunctive care that supports healing regardless of antibiotics. Off-loading pressure, thorough debridement of callus and necrotic tissue, moist wound dressings, and glycemic control are essential; avoid cytotoxic antiseptics like hydrogen peroxide or povidone iodine for routine cleansing, and reserve topical antimicrobials for selected scenarios, as evidence for routine topical antibiotics is limited and not recommended for uninfected ulcers [^113dKeTT] [^1119We4k] [^1135MiKH].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. For an uncomplicated, clinically uninfected diabetic foot ulcer, antibiotics are not indicated; prioritize wound care, off-loading, and glycemic control. If infection is present, confirm clinically, obtain appropriate cultures when indicated, start narrow empiric therapy targeting gram-positive organisms for mild disease, treat for 1–2 weeks (extend only if justified), and adjust to culture results and clinical response with close follow-up and a low threshold to reassess if the course is atypical or prolonged [^11569Y16] [^116Nf3FQ] [^115gaEyS].

---

Do not use antibiotics for an **uninfected diabetic foot ulcer** [^11569Y16]; they do not improve healing or prevent infection and should be avoided [^1165nJXy]. Antibiotics are only indicated when there are **clinical signs of infection** (erythema, warmth, swelling, tenderness, or purulence) [^1152jYcX]. If infection is present, treat for 1–2 weeks [^116Nf3FQ] with an agent targeting gram-positive cocci (including MRSA if risk factors exist) [^117KPuJz], and adjust based on cultures and clinical response [^115gaEyS]. Prolonged or prophylactic antibiotic use increases resistance and adverse effects without benefit [^11185wua].

---

## Indications for antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are **not indicated for uninfected diabetic foot ulcers** [^11569Y16]. They should only be used when there is clinical evidence of infection, such as:

- Erythema
- Warmth
- Swelling
- Tenderness
- Purulence
- Systemic signs (fever, chills, malaise) [^112VzzR1]

The diagnosis of infection is **primarily clinical** [^1152jYcX], supported by laboratory and imaging studies when necessary [^1126Tfnr].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

When infection is confirmed, **antibiotic selection should be guided by**:

- Severity of infection
- Likely pathogens
- Local resistance patterns
- Patient-specific factors (allergies, renal function, comorbidities) [^115KYpaY]

For mild infections, **empiric therapy should target aerobic gram-positive cocci** (Staphylococcus aureus, including MRSA if indicated, and beta-hemolytic streptococci) [^117KPuJz]. Common oral options include:

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** |
|-|-|
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | First-line for mild infections |
| Cephalexin | Alternative for mild infections |
| Clindamycin | Penicillin allergy |
| Doxycycline | MRSA coverage |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | MRSA coverage |

---

For moderate to severe infections, **broad-spectrum intravenous therapy** is recommended initially, with subsequent narrowing based on culture results [^113C1iip]. Common regimens include:

- Piperacillin-tazobactam
- Ceftriaxone plus metronidazole
- Vancomycin plus a fluoroquinolone (e.g. levofloxacin)

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The **recommended duration** of antibiotic therapy depends on the severity and extent of infection:

- **Mild infections**: 1–2 weeks [^116Nf3FQ]
- **Moderate infections**: 2–3 weeks (extend if slow response)
- **Severe infections or osteomyelitis**: 4–6 weeks or longer, often requiring surgical intervention [^111Fcscx]

Therapy should be **continued until clinical resolution of infection**, not necessarily until complete wound healing [^112FLzKd].

---

## Risks and consequences of unnecessary antibiotic use

Unnecessary antibiotic use in uninfected diabetic foot ulcers carries **significant risks**, including:

- Increased antibiotic resistance [^11185wua]
- Adverse drug reactions (e.g. allergic reactions, gastrointestinal disturbances)
- Increased healthcare costs
- Delayed wound healing due to disruption of normal wound microbiota

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

Studies have consistently shown that antibiotics do not improve healing or prevent infection in **uninfected diabetic foot ulcers** [^notfound]. Their use should be reserved for cases with confirmed infection, where they are effective in reducing bacterial load, controlling infection, and promoting wound healing [^112brUtv].

---

## Adjunctive therapies and wound care

In addition to antibiotics when indicated, **comprehensive wound care is essential** [^1126Tfnr]:

- Regular debridement of necrotic tissue
- Offloading pressure from the ulcer
- Moist wound dressings
- Glycemic control
- Regular monitoring and reassessment

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from the **International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF)** and the **Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)** strongly recommend against the use of antibiotics in uninfected diabetic foot ulcers [^11569Y16]. They emphasize accurate diagnosis of infection, appropriate antibiotic selection, and adherence to recommended durations to minimize resistance and adverse effects [^116jzxmM].

---

Antibiotics are **not indicated for uninfected diabetic foot ulcers** [^11569Y16]. They should only be used when there is clinical evidence of infection, with therapy tailored to the severity, likely pathogens, and patient-specific factors. Unnecessary antibiotic use confers no benefit and increases the risk of resistance and adverse effects [^11185wua].

### Empirical therapy for diabetic foot infections: are there clinical clues to guide antibiotic selection? [^113MVkuR]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Initial antibiotic therapy for diabetic foot infections is usually empirical. Several principles may help to avoid selecting either an unnecessarily broad or inappropriately narrow regimen. First, clinically severe infections require broad-spectrum therapy, while less severe infections may not. Second, aerobic Gram-positive cocci, particularly Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) for patients at high-risk) should always be covered. Third, therapy should also be targeted at aerobic Gram-negative pathogens if the infection is chronic or has failed to respond to previous antibiotic therapy. Fourth, anti-anaerobe agents should be considered for necrotic or gangrenous infections on an ischaemic limb. Parenteral therapy is needed for severe infections, but oral therapy is adequate for most mild or moderate infections.

### Anti-infective therapy for foot ulcers in patients with diabetes [^1168xhEk]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2005). Low credibility.

Foot infection is a huge economic and social burden for patients with diabetes. The etiology is multifactorial, necessitating a multidisciplinary team for successful treatment and prevention. Infection usually is a consequence rather than the cause of foot ulcers in patients with diabetes. Infection is a clinical diagnosis and can be categorized as mild cellulitis, moderate to severe cellulitis, and osteomyelitis. No single imaging technique is 100% sensitive or specific for the diagnosis of osteomyelitis. Infected foot ulcers require appropriate tissue and bone cultures to guide antibiotic therapy whereas uninfected ulcers, which may be colonized with bacteria, do not require antibiotics. Gram-positive organisms account for a substantial proportion of infections with increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in recent years. Osteomyelitis in patients with diabetes requires aggressive surgical intervention in addition to antibiotics. Duration of treatment varies from 2 to 6 weeks based on the severity of infection, along with surgical debridement. Prevention of foot ulcer and infection requires patient education, detection of neuropathy, glycemic control, and proper foot care with foot hygiene and appropriate footwear. The patient is an important member of the team and should be taught the importance of self examination and early reporting of foot problems.

Diabetes-related osteomyelitis of the foot (DFO) antibiotic duration — Recommendation 16 states: Consider a duration of up to 3 weeks of antibiotic therapy after minor amputation for diabetes-related osteomyelitis of the foot and positive bone margin culture and 6 weeks for diabetes-related foot osteomyelitis without bone resection or amputation (Conditional; Low). The rationale adds that we suggest administrating antibiotic agents at their upper recommended dosage range and usually for a total duration substantially longer than for soft-tissue infection, and that long-term suppressive antibiotic therapy is generally warranted only for individuals with retained orthopaedic hardware or extensive necrotic bone not amenable to complete debridement. Supporting data note two randomized controlled studies suggesting total duration for non-surgically treated DFO need not be as long as previously proposed, that duration after surgical debridement is likely shorter than for non-surgical treatment, and that in a pilot trial patients receiving either a 3- or 6-week course had similar outcomes and antibiotic-related adverse events.

### IDSA releases guidelines on the diagnosis and… [^113k5wzy]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

If hospitalization is not required, the wound should be debrided and probed. Specimens for culture should be obtained, and a wound-care regimen prescribed. Empiric parenteral antimicrobial therapy should be initiated. The patient should be reevaluated in three to five days — sooner if worsening. Finally, any necessary consultations should be made. The accompanying figure illustrates the approach to treating a foot wound in a patient with diabetes. Diagnosis and Treatment Infection should be diagnosed clinically based on the presence of pus or at least two of the following: redness, warmth, swelling or induration, and pain or tenderness. Aerobic gram-positive cocci are the predominant pathogens in diabetic foot infections. Patients who have chronic wounds or who have recently received antibiotics also may be infected with gram-negative rods. Thus, diabetic foot infections usually are treated with antibiotics.

Antibiotic Therapy Although antibiotics are necessary to treat most infected wounds, they often are insufficient without appropriate care, which includes proper cleaning of wounds, debridement of callus and necrotic tissue, and off-loading of pressure. The antibiotic should be chosen on the basis of the severity of the infection and its likely causes. Clinically uninfected ulcers should not be treated with antibiotics. For outpatients with mild to moderate cases of diabetic foot infections, antibiotics shown to be effective in clinical studies include ofloxacin, piperacillin-tazo-bactam, levofloxacin, clindamycin, pexiganan, and linezolid. Virtually all severe and some moderate infections require parenteral therapy, at least initially. Highly bioavailable oral antibiotics can be used in most mild and in many moderate infections, including some cases of osteomyelitis. Topical therapy may be used for some mild superficial infections.

Treatment should last one to two weeks for mild infection, with another week or two added as needed; two to four weeks for moderate to severe infection; and at least four to six weeks for patients with osteomyelitis. Prevention Patients can minimize foot infections by optimizing glycemic control, wearing appropriate footwear, avoiding foot trauma, performing daily self-examination of the feet, and reporting any changes to health care professionals. Physicians should reinforce these measures by questioning patients with diabetes about foot care and regularly examining their feet and shoes.

### Diabetes-related foot infections: diagnosis and treatment… [^1151p9EP]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Diabetes-related foot infections form in approximately 40% of foot ulcers in patients with diabetes mellitus. 1 Infections can rapidly progress to cellulitis, abscess formation, osteomyelitis, and necrotizing fasciitis. In 2016, diabetes-related foot infections contributed to more than 130, 000 lower-extremity amputations in the United States. 2 The five-year mortality rate following amputation is approximately 50%, exceeding the mortality rate of many cancers.
3. Microbiology The most commonly isolated organisms from diabetes-related foot infections are the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Enterococcus species. Wounds infected by methicillin-resistant S. aureus occur in approximately 15% of cases and are more serious considering the virulence of MRSA and the limited number of treatment options.

6 Routine superficial wound cultures should be avoided because of the high rate of contaminants; however, deep tissue cultures obtained using aseptic procedures help guide treatment. 6, 12 A negative MRSA nares culture reduces the likelihood that a diabetes-related foot infection is caused by MRSA. Studies have shown correlations with negative predictive values between 73% and 90%. 13, 14. Studies of adjunctive treatments for healing diabetes-related foot ulcers have mixed results. Of these alternative treatments, hyperbaric oxygen therapy has the best data, with evidence showing that it lowers the risk of major amputations and improves wound healing; however, evidence does not support reductions in minor amputations or mortality.

37 Maggot debridement therapy has good data, with evidence for shortening ulcer healing time and reducing the rate of amputations. 38 Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors have not been shown to help resolve an infection or foot ulcer significantly, but they may decrease the risk of surgical interventions and amputations. 39 Promising evidence exists for topical oxygen therapy and laser therapy for improving diabetes-related foot ulcer healing; however, more evidence is needed on patient-oriented outcomes before widespread adoption of either intervention. 40, 41.

### Treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections in the diabetic patient [^114Ju69m]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Diabetic neuropathy can lead to the development of ulcers on the lower extremities. Prompt treatment lowers the likelihood of infection and reduces the probability that an established infection will lead to amputation. Antibiotics are selected on the basis of the suspected organism and the level of infection. Unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis is discouraged because it increases the likelihood that bacterial resistance to the antibiotic agent will develop. Culture samples must be taken by curettage of biopsy rather than by swabbing to assure detection of pathogens.

### Management of osteomyelitis of the foot in diabetes mellitus [^113J6J5s]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2010). Medium credibility.

Although osteomyelitis occurs in approximately 10–20% of patients with diabetes-related foot ulcers, no widely accepted guideline is available for its treatment. In particular, little consensus exists on the place of surgery. A number of experts claim that early surgical excision of all infected or necrotic bone is essential. Others suggest that surgery should not be performed routinely, but instead only in patients who do not respond to antibiotic treatment or in case of particular clinical indications. Unfortunately, no studies have directly compared the two approaches. Over 500 cases of conservative (that is, nonsurgical) management with resolution rates of 60–80% have been described previously. Most patients in these series, however, received prolonged courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which increase the risk of diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile or the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms. By contrast, relatively few series of primarily surgical management have been published, with widely differing outcomes, and some of them also reported high recurrence rates. Further research is required to establish the relative importance of each approach, but the available data clearly indicate that a combined assessment and treatment by surgeons and physicians together is essential for many patients.

### Diabetic foot ulcer microbiome: one small step for molecular microbiology… One giant leap for understanding diabetic foot ulcers? [^115meRB7]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Foot infections in individuals with diabetes are a major cause of morbidity, constituting the most common reason for both diabetes-related hospitalization and lower extremity amputations. Optimal treatment of these diabetic foot infections requires recognizing which foot ulcers are infected and prescribing pathogen-appropriate antibiotic therapy. Most experts concur that diagnosing infection should be based on the presence of primary or secondary clinical signs and symptoms of inflammation, but the frequent presence of peripheral neuropathy or peripheral arterial disease may confound the diagnosis. Thus, some favor using bacterial density in wound cultures to help diagnose infection. This concept is based on the belief that a high wound "bioburden" leads to "critical colonization", an intermediary state on the way to overt infection that may be responsible for delayed wound healing and that may respond to antimicrobial therapy. Certainly, treatment of clinically overt diabetic foot infection requires appropriate systemic antibiotic therapy, which is best guided by identifying the causative pathogens.

### Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of foot infection in persons with diabetes (IWGDF 2019 update) [^115KJ172]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has published evidence-based guidelines on the prevention and management of diabetic foot disease since 1999. This guideline is on the diagnosis and treatment of foot infection in persons with diabetes and updates the 2015 IWGDF infection guideline. On the basis of patient, intervention, comparison, outcomes (PICOs) developed by the infection committee, in conjunction with internal and external reviewers and consultants, and on systematic reviews the committee conducted on the diagnosis of infection (new) and treatment of infection (updated from 2015), we offer 27 recommendations. These cover various aspects of diagnosing soft tissue and bone infection, including the classification scheme for diagnosing infection and its severity. Of note, we have updated this scheme for the first time since we developed it 15years ago. We also review the microbiology of diabetic foot infections, including how to collect samples and to process them to identify causative pathogens. Finally, we discuss the approach to treating diabetic foot infections, including selecting appropriate empiric and definitive antimicrobial therapy for soft tissue and for bone infections, when and how to approach surgical treatment, and which adjunctive treatments we think are or are not useful for the infectious aspects of diabetic foot problems. For this version of the guideline, we also updated four tables and one figure from the 2016 guideline. We think that following the principles of diagnosing and treating diabetic foot infections outlined in this guideline can help clinicians to provide better care for these patients.

### Diagnosis and treatment of diabetic foot infections [^1126Tfnr]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 1. Foot infections in patients with diabetes cause substantial morbidity and frequent visits to health care professionals and may lead to amputation of a lower extremity. 2. Diabetic foot infections require attention to local (foot) and systemic (metabolic) issues and coordinated management, preferably by a multidisciplinary foot-care team (A-II). The team managing these infections should include, or have ready access to, an infectious diseases specialist or a medical microbiologist (B-II). 3. The major predisposing factor to these infections is foot ulceration, which is usually related to peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral vascular disease and various immunological disturbances play a secondary role. 4. Aerobic Gram-positive cocci (especially Staphylococcus aureus) are the predominant pathogens in diabetic foot infections. Patients who have chronic wounds or who have recently received antibiotic therapy may also be infected with Gram-negative rods, and those with foot ischemia or gangrene may have obligate anaerobic pathogens. 5. Wound infections must be diagnosed clinically on the basis of local (and occasionally systemic) signs and symptoms of inflammation. Laboratory (including microbiological) investigations are of limited use for diagnosing infection, except in cases of osteomyelitis (B-II). 6. Send appropriately obtained specimens for culture before starting empirical antibiotic therapy in all cases of infection, except perhaps those that are mild and previously untreated (B-III). Tissue specimens obtained by biopsy, ulcer curettage, or aspiration are preferable to wound swab specimens (A-I). 7. Imaging studies may help diagnose or better define deep, soft-tissue purulent collections and are usually needed to detect pathological findings in bone. Plain radiography may be adequate in many cases, but MRI (in preference to isotope scanning) is more sensitive and specific, especially for detection of soft-tissue lesions (A-I). 8. Infections should be categorized by their severity on the basis of readily assessable clinical and laboratory features (B-II). Most important among these are the specific tissues involved, the adequacy of arterial perfusion, and the presence of systemic toxicity or metabolic instability. Categorization helps determine the degree of risk to the patient and the limb and, thus, the urgency and venue of management. 9. Available evidence does not support treating clinically uninfected ulcers with antibiotic therapy (D-III). Antibiotic therapy is necessary for virtually all infected wounds, but it is often insufficient without appropriate wound care. 10. Select an empirical antibiotic regimen on the basis of the severity of the infection and the likely etiologic agent(s) (B-II). Therapy aimed solely at aerobic Gram-positive cocci may be sufficient for mild-to-moderate infections in patients who have not recently received antibiotic therapy (A-II). Broad-spectrum empirical therapy is not routinely required but is indicated for severe infections, pending culture results and antibiotic susceptibility data (B-III). Take into consideration any recent antibiotic therapy and local antibiotic susceptibility data, especially the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or other resistant organisms. Definitive therapy should be based on both the culture results and susceptibility data and the clinical response to the empirical regimen (C-III). 11. There is only limited evidence with which to make informed choices among the various topical, oral, and parenteral antibiotic agents. Virtually all severe and some moderate infections require parenteral therapy, at least initially (C-III). Highly bioavailable oral antibiotics can be used in most mild and in many moderate infections, including some cases of osteomyelitis (A-II). Topical therapy may be used for some mild superficial infections (B-I). 12. Continue antibiotic therapy until there is evidence that the infection has resolved but not necessarily until a wound has healed. Suggestions for the duration of antibiotic therapy are as follows: for mild infections, 12 weeks usually suffices, but some require an additional 12 weeks; for moderate and severe infections, usually 24 weeks is sufficient, depending on the structures involved, the adequacy of debridement, the type of soft-tissue wound cover, and wound vascularity (A-II); and for osteomyelitis, generally at least 46 weeks is required, but a shorter duration is sufficient if the entire infected bone is removed, and probably a longer duration is needed if infected bone remains (B-II). 13. If an infection in a clinically stable patient fails to respond to 1 antibiotic courses, consider discontinuing all antimicrobials and, after a few days, obtaining optimal culture specimens (C-III). 14. Seek surgical consultation and, when needed, intervention for infections accompanied by a deep abscess, extensive bone or joint involvement, crepitus, substantial necrosis or gangrene, or necrotizing fasciitis (A-II). Evaluating the limb's arterial supply and revascularizing when indicated are particularly important. Surgeons with experience and interest in the field should be recruited by the foot-care team, if possible. 15. Providing optimal wound care, in addition to appropriate antibiotic treatment of the infection, is crucial for healing (A-I). This includes proper wound cleansing, debridement of any callus and necrotic tissue, and, especially, off-loading of pressure. There is insufficient evidence to recommend use of a specific wound dressing or any type of wound healing agents or products for infected foot wounds. 16. Patients with infected wounds require early and careful follow-up observation to ensure that the selected medical and surgical treatment regimens have been appropriate and effective (B-III). 17. Studies have not adequately defined the role of most adjunctive therapies for diabetic foot infections, but systematic reviews suggest that granulocyte colony-stimulating factors and systemic hyperbaric oxygen therapy may help prevent amputations (B-I). These treatments may be useful for severe infections or for those that have not adequately responded to therapy, despite correcting for all amenable local and systemic adverse factors. 18. Spread of infection to bone (osteitis or osteomyelitis) may be difficult to distinguish from noninfectious osteoarthropathy. Clinical examination and imaging tests may suffice, but bone biopsy is valuable for establishing the diagnosis of osteomyelitis, for defining the pathogenic organism(s), and for determining the antibiotic susceptibilities of such organisms (B-II). 19. Although this field has matured, further research is much needed. The committee especially recommends that adequately powered prospective studies be undertaken to elucidate and validate systems for classifying infection, diagnosing osteomyelitis, defining optimal antibiotic regimens in various situations, and clarifying the role of surgery in treating osteomyelitis (A-III).

Diabetes-related foot infection (DFI) adjuncts — The guideline states: "We suggest not using the following treatments to address DFIs: (a) adjunctive G-CSF treatment or (b) topical antiseptics, silver preparations, honey, bacteriophage therapy, or negative-pressure wound therapy (with or without instillation)". Rationale indicates that "G-CSF to a diabetes-related foot treatment does not significantly affect the likelihood of resolution of infection, healing of the wound, or the duration of systemic antibiotic therapy", although "It does seem to be associated with a reduced likelihood of lower extremity surgical interventions (including amputation) and a reduced duration of hospital stay, although the profile of patients who might benefit is unclear, especially in relation to the costs and potential adverse effects". For topical agents, "the available evidence does not support any beneficial effect for most of them", and "Silver compounds do not offer benefits in ulcer healing (as described in the IWGDF wound healing guidelines) and there is no evidence to support their effectiveness in the treatment of the infectious aspects of a DFU".

When to refer?

Refer immediately patients with a life threatening or limb threatening problem such as foot ulceration with fever or any signs of sepsis; ulceration with limb ischaemia; gangrene, or a suspected deep seated soft tissue or bone infection usually indicated by either a grossly swollen foot with shiny skin and patches of discoloration or a gritty feel to the bone during a probe to bone test in an open wound. Refer to a specialised diabetic foot centre or to general surgery for wound care, offloading, revascularisation if needed, and rehabilitation.

Explain to patients the need to seek specialist care to limit complications. Provide detailed and clear communication before patients are referred so that multidisciplinary care can be facilitated at the earliest opportunity.

Before referral, wash the ulcer with clean water or saline and apply a sterile inert dressing such as a saline soaked gauze to control exudates and maintain a warm, moist environment for healing. Avoid microbicidal agents such as hydrogen peroxide, povidone iodine, or chlorhexidine to clean or dress the ulcer as these are cytotoxic. Costly antimicrobial dressings are not recommended. Adjust dressings, footwear, and ambulation to avoid weight bearing on an ulcerated foot. Early and aggressive treatment to control infection is important, especially in the presence of an ulcer. Start antibiotic treatment according to antibiotic policy based on local resistance patterns. Before starting antibiotics, take a piece of soft tissue from the base of the ulcer for culture and sensitivity, or take a deep swab for culture. Refer urgently, within one or two days, patients with a history of rest pain, uncomplicated ulcer, or acute Charcot foot. For patients with rest pain or intermittent claudication, offer referral to vascular intervention services for further investigations such as Duplex ultrasonography, and consideration for revascularisation.

The management and referral pathways between primary care, specialty diabetic foot centres, and multidisciplinary foot care services need to be integrated (see infographic).

### IWGDF / IDSA guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes-related foot infections (IWGDF / IDSA 2023) [^114Sk8Wd]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has published evidence-based guidelines on the management and prevention of diabetes-related foot diseases since 1999. The present guideline is an update of the 2019 IWGDF guideline on the diagnosis and management of foot infections in persons with diabetes mellitus. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was used for the development of this guideline. This was structured around identifying clinically relevant questions in the P(A)ICO format, determining patient-important outcomes, systematically reviewing the evidence, assessing the certainty of the evidence, and finally moving from evidence to the recommendation. This guideline was developed for healthcare professionals involved in diabetes-related foot care to inform clinical care around patient-important outcomes. Two systematic reviews from 2019 were updated to inform this guideline, and a total of 149 studies (62 new) meeting inclusion criteria were identified from the updated search and incorporated in this guideline. Updated recommendations are derived from these systematic reviews, and best practice statements made where evidence was not available. Evidence was weighed in light of benefits and harms to arrive at a recommendation. The certainty of the evidence for some recommendations was modified in this update with a more refined application of the GRADE framework centred around patient important outcomes. This is highlighted in the rationale section of this update. A note is also made where the newly identified evidence did not alter the strength or certainty of evidence for previous recommendations. The recommendations presented here continue to cover various aspects of diagnosing soft tissue and bone infections, including the classification scheme for diagnosing infection and its severity. Guidance on how to collect microbiological samples, and how to process them to identify causative pathogens, is also outlined. Finally, we present the approach to treating foot infections in persons with diabetes, including selecting appropriate empiric and definitive antimicrobial therapy for soft tissue and bone infections; when and how to approach surgical treatment; and which adjunctive treatments may or may not affect the infectious outcomes of diabetes-related foot problems. We believe that following these recommendations will help healthcare professionals provide better care for persons with diabetes and foot infections, prevent the number of foot and limb amputations, and reduce the patient and healthcare burden of diabetes-related foot disease.

### Diagnosis and treatment of diabetes-related foot infections… [^111k1wPS]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS FOR PRACTICE
- In patients with a suspected diabetic foot infection limited to the soft tissue, culture of a soft tissue sample should be considered instead of wound swab due to higher accuracy.
- To diagnose osteomyelitis in a patient with diabetes, a combination of probe-to-bone testing, plain radiography, and ESR, CRP, or procalcitonin levels should be considered as initial tests.
- In patients with a diabetic foot infection and suspected osteomyelitis, a bone biopsy should be considered due to poor correlation of soft tissue and bone culture results.
- Urgent surgical consultation is recommended in cases of severe or moderate diabetic foot infection complicated by extensive gangrene, necrotizing infection, deep abscess, compartment syndrome, or severe lower limb ischemia. From the AFP Editors Diabetic foot infections are the most frequent complication of diabetes that leads to hospitalization. They are also the most common cause of lower extremity amputation.

Less than one-half of infected diabetic foot ulcers heal within 1 year, and 10% of those that heal recur. The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot and Infectious Diseases Society of America have published guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of these infections. SubscribeFrom $180

### Diabetes-related foot infections: diagnosis and treatment [^1128w9RX]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Diabetes-related foot infections occur in approximately 40% of diabetes-related foot ulcers and cause significant morbidity. Clinicians should consider patient risk factors (e.g., presence of foot ulcers greater than 2 cm, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, poor vascular perfusion, comorbid illness) when evaluating for a foot infection or osteomyelitis. Indicators of infection include erythema, induration, tenderness, warmth, and drainage. Superficial wound cultures should be avoided because of the high rate of contaminants. Deep cultures obtained through aseptic procedures (e.g., incision and drainage, debridement, bone culture) help guide treatment. Plain radiography is used for initial imaging if osteomyelitis is suspected; however, magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography may help if radiography is inconclusive, the extent of infection is unknown, or if the infection orientation needs to be determined to help in surgical planning. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae are the most commonly isolated pathogens, although polymicrobial infections are common. Antibiotic therapy should cover commonly isolated organisms and reflect local resistance patterns, patient preference, and the severity of the foot infection. Mild and some moderate infections may be treated with oral antibiotics. Severe infections require intravenous antibiotics. Treatment duration is typically one to two weeks and is longer for slowly resolving infections or osteomyelitis. Severe or persistent infections may require surgery and specialized team-based wound care. Although widely recommended, there is little evidence on the effectiveness of primary prevention strategies. Systematic assessment, counseling, and comorbidity management are hallmarks of effective secondary prevention for diabetes-related foot infections.

### Diabetic foot infections: questions for an infectious disease consultant [^112F65Cp]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot infection can lead to limb amputation in approximately 17% of affected patients. Given the complex pathophysiology associated with diabetic foot infection, the goal of limb preservation is best achieved with a multidisciplinary approach and a team of providers including infectious disease consultants. However, these infections often affect populations living in nonmetropolitan areas, where access to an infectious disease physician may be limited. It may fall on the surgeons and primary care providers to not only diagnose infections early, including osteomyelitis, but also facilitate prompt, appropriate antibiotic management. The decision to treat with antibiotics alone versus surgery, choice of antibiotic, route of administration, and duration of treatment are complicated concepts that require a patient-specific approach. In addition, use of oral antibiotics and long-acting lipoglycopeptides has gained prominence and offers an alternate solution to the tedious, resource-intense process of outpatient intravenous antibiotic treatment. The goal of this article is to outline and address diagnostic and management questions that would be posed to an infectious disease consultant. The responses would include a literature review of current management concepts and highlights from the 2023 Infectious Disease Society of America and International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot guidelines.

Diabetes-related foot infection (DFI) microbiology sampling — Recommendation 5 states: In a person with suspected soft tissue DFI, consider a sample for culture to determine the causative microorganisms, preferably by aseptically collecting a tissue specimen (by curettage or biopsy) from the wound. (Conditional; Moderate). In most cases, obtaining a debrided, uncontaminated specimen for culture provides useful information on pathogens and susceptibility; in an acute, non-severe DFI without recent antibiotics or other risk factors for unusual or antibiotic-resistant pathogens, selecting empiric therapy without culture may be reasonable. In other situations, despite superficial swabs being easier, we advise collecting a soft tissue specimen based on evidence that tissue specimens have higher sensitivity and specificity than superficial swabs, and although tissue sampling may require more training and poses slight risks, the benefits clearly outweigh this minimal risk. Repeating cultures may be useful when a patient is not responding to appropriate therapy, but may isolate resistant contaminants; accuracy depends on thorough communication along the sample pathway, and clinicians should provide key clinical details while laboratories provide comprehensive reporting. Performing a Gram-stained smear of DFI material could be an easy, inexpensive way to visualise likely pathogen classes to help direct empiric therapy, with a conditional recommendation and moderate certainty of evidence.

### Moderate to severe soft tissue diabetic foot infections: a randomized, controlled, pilot trial of post-debridement antibiotic treatment for 10 versus 20 days [^117CGQ5R]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Virtually all infections of the foot in persons with diabetes involve the soft tissues. These soft tissue diabetic foot infections (ST-DFI) usually begin with superficial invasion of an ulcer or wound, but may progress contiguously to cellulitis, phlegmon, abscess, fasciitis, or osteomyelitis. – The recommended duration of antibiotic therapy for ST-DFIs, which is considerably shorter than for diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO), is largely based on clinical experience. While there are some data concerning the duration of antibiotic therapy of non-amputated DFO, few studies have investigated the optimal duration for ST-DFI not accompanied by DFO. Many experts in the field recommend administering systemic antibiotic therapy for 1 to 3 weeks, with appropriate tissue debridement as needed. – The most recent recommendations of the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot; state 1–2 weeks is adequate for most ST-DFIs. The recommendations of the 2012 guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) are for 2–3 for moderate to severe ST-DFI (point 24 of recommendations), but urge decisions be based on the individual clinical response of therapy. Various reviews report antibiotic regimens for ST-DFI of relatively short (7–14 days)or relatively long durations (14–28 days). The results of our own retrospective study of 463 ST-DFIs did not define an optimal duration antibiotic therapy for ST-DFIs, but suggested that our current practice (median of 18 days for ST-DFI) might be too long. In that retrospective study, we failed to determine any minimal threshold for systemic antibiotics in ST-DFIs. The median duration of antimicrobial administration of 18 days statistically yielded to be too long regarding remission, because treatment durations as short as 7–10 days seemed to be enough, whenever the clinical evolution was favorable. Another study of patients with various types of cellulitis found that clinical remission rates were similar for those treated with 7 days of systemic antibiotic therapy compared to those who received longer treatment durations.

### Diabetic foot infections: state-of-the-art [^1131PbzH]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Foot infections are frequent and potentially devastating complications of diabetes. Unchecked, infection can progress contiguously to involve the deeper soft tissues and ultimately the bone. Foot ulcers in people with diabetes are most often the consequence of one or more of the following: peripheral sensory neuropathy, motor neuropathy and gait disorders, peripheral arterial insufficiency or immunological impairments. Infection develops in over half of foot ulcers and is the factor that most often leads to lower extremity amputation. These amputations are associated with substantial morbidity, reduced quality of life and major financial costs. Most infections can be successfully treated with optimal wound care, antibiotic therapy and surgical procedures. Employing evidence-based guidelines, multidisciplinary teams and institution-specific clinical pathways provides the best approach to guide clinicians through this multifaceted problem. All clinicians regularly seeing people with diabetes should have an understanding of how to prevent, diagnose and treat foot infections, which requires familiarity with the pathophysiology of the problem and the literature supporting currently recommended care.

### Executive summary: 2012 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of diabetic foot infections [^112VzzR1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Foot infections are a common and serious problem in persons with diabetes. Diabetic foot infections (DFIs) typically begin in a wound, most often a neuropathic ulceration. While all wounds are colonized with microorganisms, the presence of infection is defined by ≥ 2 classic findings of inflammation or purulence. Infections are then classified into mild (superficial and limited in size and depth), moderate (deeper or more extensive), or severe (accompanied by systemic signs or metabolic perturbations). This classification system, along with a vascular assessment, helps determine which patients should be hospitalized, which may require special imaging procedures or surgical interventions, and which will require amputation. Most DFIs are polymicrobial, with aerobic gram-positive cocci (GPC), and especially staphylococci, the most common causative organisms. Aerobic gram-negative bacilli are frequently copathogens in infections that are chronic or follow antibiotic treatment, and obligate anaerobes may be copathogens in ischemic or necrotic wounds. Wounds without evidence of soft tissue or bone infection do not require antibiotic therapy. For infected wounds, obtain a post-debridement specimen (preferably of tissue) for aerobic and anaerobic culture. Empiric antibiotic therapy can be narrowly targeted at GPC in many acutely infected patients, but those at risk for infection with antibiotic-resistant organisms or with chronic, previously treated, or severe infections usually require broader spectrum regimens. Imaging is helpful in most DFIs; plain radiographs may be sufficient, but magnetic resonance imaging is far more sensitive and specific. Osteomyelitis occurs in many diabetic patients with a foot wound and can be difficult to diagnose (optimally defined by bone culture and histology) and treat (often requiring surgical debridement or resection, and/or prolonged antibiotic therapy). Most DFIs require some surgical intervention, ranging from minor (debridement) to major (resection, amputation). Wounds must also be properly dressed and off-loaded of pressure, and patients need regular follow-up. An ischemic foot may require revascularization, and some nonresponding patients may benefit from selected adjunctive measures. Employing multidisciplinary foot teams improves outcomes. Clinicians and healthcare organizations should attempt to monitor, and thereby improve, their outcomes and processes in caring for DFIs.

### Moderate to severe soft tissue diabetic foot infections: a randomized, controlled, pilot trial of post-debridement antibiotic treatment for 10 versus 20 days [^115R93Xq]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Determining the most appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy for ST-DFIs is important, to avoid adverse outcomes both of under-treating these serious infections and overtreating them in in violation of antibiotic stewardship principle. Thus, we need properly conducted randomized-controlled trials (RCT) to investigate this issue. Unfortunately, RCTs in this population are difficult to perform, due to various conceptual and practical problems. These include the confounding issues related to the: presence of limb ischemia; need for wound debridement; virulence of the pathogens; and, patient compliance. – Furthermore, it is unclear if antibiotic can be discontinued when clinical signs or symptoms used to diagnose infection improve, or should be continued until they completely resolve. Moreover, recurrences of ST-DFI frequently appear with newly diagnosed bone involvement (DFO) or related to worsening ischemia. Our experience in performing antimicrobial RCTs in the DFI population, and our reviews on the antibiotic optimization in DFOs, make clear to us the need for a pilot RCT of a fixed duration of antibiotic therapy for ST-DFI. Of note, this RCT targets the therapy of ST-DFI. In contrast, it does not address the therapy of ischemia and/or the healing of diabetic foot ulcers, for which a broad literature is available.

Diabetic foot infection — local wound care and antimicrobial therapy are emphasized as follows: patients with clinical infection and a prior history of MRSA should be considered to have the same pathogen until proven otherwise and treated accordingly. Antimicrobial therapy alone is not sufficient for treating infections associated with foot ulcers, and while there is little data on topical treatment, such therapy at present can only be considered adjunctive to systemic antimicrobial therapy. The wound should be assessed and cleansed thoroughly, using proper debridement as indicated, and the patient should be reassessed within 48 to 72 hours; if no improvement is noted, hospitalization with intravenous antibiotics should be considered. Management should also include close monitoring of the patient's hyperglycemia and general health status, and patient compliance as well as a reduction in the pressure of the infected limb must be considered early on in the treatment of any diabetic foot infection.

### Diabetic foot infections: the role of microbiology and antibiotic treatment [^115LYjZe]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for the development of foot infections. Among the risk factors that contribute to the development of diabetic foot infections are local neuropathy, vascular changes and depressed local host defenses. The microbiology of these infections is often complex and can be polymicrobial. Treatment of these infections depends on the severity and extent of infection. Treatment should involve a multi-disciplinary team approach involving surgeons and infectious disease specialists. The current recommendations for treatment are primarily based on expert opinion and consensus rather than clinical trials. No single agent or combination of agents has been shown to be superior to others. The aim of this review is to provide valid options of therapy, especially with regard to newer agents that are currently available for treatment of both soft tissue infections and osteomyelitis.

Diabetic foot infection (DFI) is among the most common diabetic complications requiring hospitalization. Prompt emergency department diagnosis and evidence-based management can prevent eventual amputation and associated disability and mortality. Underlying neuropathy, arterial occlusion, immune dysfunction, and hyperglycemia-associated dehydration and ketoacidosis can all contribute to severity and conspire to make DFI diagnosis and management difficult. Serious complications include osteomyelitis, necrotizing infection, and sepsis. Practice guidelines are designed to assist frontline providers with correct diagnosis, categorization, and treatment decisions. Management generally includes a careful lower extremity examination and plain x-ray, obtaining appropriate tissue cultures, and evidence-based antibiotic selection tailored to severity.

Non-limb-threatening diabetic foot infections — treatment of diabetic foot infections is guided by the severity of the infection, and non-limb-threatening infections involve superficial ulcerations without significant ischemia and they do not involve bone or joint. Typically, cellulitis does not extend 2 cm beyond the ulcer margins and there is an absence of systemic symptoms (e.g. fever, chills, nausea, vomiting). These less severe infections that frequently complicate diabetic foot ulcers may be initially treated in an outpatient setting.

Foot infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetics. Evaluation of diabetic foot infections often requires clinical, radiologic, laboratory, and microbiologic assessment. Osteomyelitis has a profound impact on the prognosis and management of these infections, and diagnosis can be difficult; the gold standard remains bone biopsy. Despite a panoply of studies, the optimal management of diabetic foot infections remains poorly understood. Antibiotics, surgery, rehabilitation and/or off-loading, and glycemic control remain the cornerstones of treatment; alternative therapies remain largely unproven.

Diabetic foot infection pathogens and stewardship — management notes emphasize that in case of mild infections the most likely causative organisms are gram‑positive pathogens (beta‑haemolytic streptococci and S. aureus), Pseudomonas species are less commonly isolated in studies from North America and Europe but more prevalent in studies from (sub)tropical climates, and for these mild infections there is time to adjust antibiotic therapy based on cultures, with therapy adjusted to target cultured bacteria if the infection does not resolve. Given the complexity and often polymicrobial nature of DFI, definitive treatment "should especially be based on principles of antibiotic stewardship", including source control with surgery if possible, starting empiric therapy with the narrowest spectrum, shortest duration, fewest adverse effects, safest and least expensive route, and switching to targeted (preferably oral) therapy based on cultured pathogens. To avoid colonisers and unjustified broad‑spectrum prescribing, sample quality is stressed, and "clinicians should consider consulting the infectious diseases/microbiology expert" for difficult cases such as those due to unusual or highly resistant pathogens. Evidence synthesis indicates that "no antibiotic class or agent has been found to be superior" for DFIs except for two studies (tigecycline significantly worse than ertapenem; ertapenem slightly lower clinical cure rate than piperacillin‑tazobactam), and "two recent retrospective studies, and one systematic review of RCTs", confirmed the absence of evidence to recommend any specific antibiotic choice regarding efficacy and final cure.

### Interventions in the management of infection in the foot in diabetes: a systematic review [^112iGgzH]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

The expert panel on diabetic foot infection (DFI) of the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot conducted a systematic review seeking all published reports relating to any type of treatment for infection of the foot in persons with diabetes published as of 30 June 2014. This review, conducted with both PubMed and EMBASE, was used to update an earlier one undertaken on 30 June 2010 using the same search string. Eligible publications included those that had outcome measures reported for both a treated and a control population that were managed either at the same time, or as part of a before-and-after case design. We did not include studies that contained only information related to definition or diagnosis, but not treatment, of DFI. The current search identified just seven new articles meeting our criteria that were published since the 33 identified with the previous search, making a total of 40 articles from the world literature. The identified articles included 37 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and three cohort studies with concurrent controls, and included studies on the use of surgical procedures, topical antiseptics, negative pressure wound therapy and hyperbaric oxygen. Among the studies were 15 RCTs that compared outcomes of treatment with new antibiotic preparations compared with a conventional therapy in the management of skin and soft tissue infection. In addition, 10 RCTs and 1 cohort study compared different treatments for osteomyelitis in the diabetic foot. Results of comparisons of different antibiotic regimens generally demonstrated that newly introduced antibiotic regimens appeared to be as effective as conventional therapy (and also more cost-effective in one study), but one study failed to demonstrate non-inferiority of a new antibiotic compared with that of a standard agent. Overall, the available literature was both limited in both the number of studies and the quality of their design. Thus, our systematic review revealed little evidence upon which to make recommendations for treatment of DFIs. There is a great need for further well-designed trials that will provide robust data upon which to make decisions about the most appropriate treatment of both skin and soft tissue infection and osteomyelitis in diabetic patients.

### New developments in diagnosing and treating diabetic foot infections [^115kBcgL]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Foot infections are common in persons with diabetes and are often the proximate cause of lower extremity amputation. There have been many publications in the past few years dealing with the appropriate ways to diagnose and treat diabetic foot infections. This review presents information gathered from a comprehensive, ongoing surveillance of the literature (published and abstracts) over the past 4 years. Prospective studies have now defined the epidemiology of diabetic foot infections, as well as methods to score and classify the wounds. Several recently published guidelines can assist clinicians in managing these infections. The etiologic agents of infection have been well-defined, and the prevalence of multi-drug-resistance pathogens is growing. Molecular methods offer great promise for quicker and more sensitive diagnosis of infection. New antimicrobial agents, both systemic and topical, as well as novel local treatments, have been shown to be effective in various studies. Improved methods of deploying older agents have added to the variety of treatment approaches now available. Several adjunctive treatments may benefit some patients but their role is as yet unclear. While there is much yet to learn about the most cost-effective ways to diagnose and treat diabetic foot infections the main effort is now to disseminate the available information and facilitate employing the evidence-based guideline recommendations.

3.3 Implementation of Other Stewardship Measures in Resource‐Poor Settings

The appropriate use of antibiotics for people living with diabetes, especially those with DFIs, calls for an antibiotic stewardship with personal commitment. Besides the administration of narrow‐spectrum agents, one of the main cornerstones is less antibiotic use. The reduction in this use may occur in many ways, whereas the presence of concomitant surgery and/or of iterative professional wound care certainly helps to achieve this goal. After surgery, most mild‐to‐moderate soft tissue infections can be treated for 1–2 weeks, and residual osteomyelitis, after resection of the bulk of bone infection, could be treated for 3–6 weeks. Oral therapy can be applied from the start for chronic and moderate infections, especially if there has been surgery or debridement of all infected tissues. Antibiotic stewardship also can occur on a larger scope. For developing countries, especially the financing problems may become an important limitation factor (and, in turn, the financials outcomes of these programmes may dominate over the clinical outcomes). Ensuring development and access to regional or international guidelines must be encouraged. The last Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice recommendations for the identification and treatment of DFI aim to reduce antibiotic resistance and the corresponding costs and adverse effects associated with antibiotic use. Similarly, the World Health Organization 2019 has produced the AWaRe classification of antibiotics. The AWaRe classification, which is an acronym for 'Access group, Watch group and Restrict group' of antibiotics was first introduced in 2017 for the Essential Medicine List (EML)‐listed antibiotics. The EML List is available in every country. However, the EML of developing countries are limited to 20–30 antibiotic choices.

2 Methods

For this narrative review, we performed a literature search in English and French languages regarding antibiotic stewardship in the management of DFI, both in developing countries and resource‐rich settings. We only included published scientific medical literature and emphasised on the usefulness of the Gram staining for the preemptive therapeutic use (not only for the diagnostic approach) community‐acquired DFIs. As there was sparse information published, we completed the review with our own experience and opinions.

### Principles and practice of antibiotic stewardship in the management of diabetic foot infections [^11185wua]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Systemic antibiotic therapy in persons with a diabetic foot infection (DFI) is frequent, increasing the risk of promoting resistance to common pathogens. Applying principles of antibiotic stewardship may help avoid this problem.

Recent Findings

We performed a systematic review of the literature, especially seeking recently published studies, for data on the role and value of antibiotic stewardship (especially reducing the spectrum and duration of antibiotic therapy) in community and hospital populations of persons with a DFI.

Summary

We found very few publications specifically concerning antibiotic stewardship in persons with a DFI. The case-mix of these patients is substantial and infection plays only one part among several chronic problems. As with other types of infections, attempting to prevent infections and avoiding or reducing the spectrum and duration of antibiotic therapy are perhaps the best ways to reduce antibiotic prescribing in the DFI population. The field is complex and necessitates knowledge over the current scientific literature and clinical experience. On a larger scale, clinical pathways, guidelines, and recommendations are additionally supportive.

### Topical antimicrobial agents for treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes [^1135MiKH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

People with diabetes are at high risk for developing foot ulcers, which often become infected. These wounds, especially when infected, cause substantial morbidity. Wound treatments should aim to alleviate symptoms, promote healing, and avoid adverse outcomes, especially lower extremity amputation. Topical antimicrobial therapy has been used on diabetic foot ulcers, either as a treatment for clinically infected wounds, or to prevent infection in clinically uninfected wounds.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of treatment with topical antimicrobial agents on: the resolution of signs and symptoms of infection; the healing of infected diabetic foot ulcers; and preventing infection and improving healing in clinically uninfected diabetic foot ulcers.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations), Ovid Embase, and EBSCO CINAHL Plus in August 2016. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and checked reference lists to identify additional studies. We used no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication, or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials conducted in any setting (inpatient or outpatient) that evaluated topical treatment with any type of solid or liquid (e.g., cream, gel, ointment) antimicrobial agent, including antiseptics, antibiotics, and antimicrobial dressings, in people with diabetes mellitus who were diagnosed with an ulcer or open wound of the foot, whether clinically infected or uninfected.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and data extraction. Initial disagreements were resolved by discussion, or by including a third review author when necessary.

Main Results

We found 22 trials that met our inclusion criteria with a total of over 2310 participants (one study did not report number of participants). The included studies mostly had small numbers of participants (from 4 to 317) and relatively short follow-up periods (4 to 24 weeks). At baseline, six trials included only people with ulcers that were clinically infected; one trial included people with both infected and uninfected ulcers; two trials included people with non-infected ulcers; and the remaining 13 studies did not report infection status. Included studies employed various topical antimicrobial treatments, including antimicrobial dressings (e.g. silver, iodides), super-oxidised aqueous solutions, zinc hyaluronate, silver sulphadiazine, tretinoin, pexiganan cream, and chloramine. We performed the following five comparisons based on the included studies: Antimicrobial dressings compared with non-antimicrobial dressings: Pooled data from five trials with a total of 945 participants suggest (based on the average treatment effect from a random-effects model) that more wounds may heal when treated with an antimicrobial dressing than with a non-antimicrobial dressing: risk ratio (RR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12 to 1.45. These results correspond to an additional 119 healing events in the antimicrobial-dressing arm per 1000 participants (95% CI 51 to 191 more). We consider this low-certainty evidence (downgraded twice due to risk of bias). The evidence on adverse events or other outcomes was uncertain (very low-certainty evidence, frequently downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision). Antimicrobial topical treatments (non dressings) compared with non-antimicrobial topical treatments (non dressings): There were four trials with a total of 132 participants in this comparison that contributed variously to the estimates of outcome data. Evidence was generally of low or very low certainty, and the 95% CIs spanned benefit and harm: proportion of wounds healed RR 2.82 (95% CI 0.56 to 14.23; 112 participants; 3 trials; very low-certainty evidence); achieving resolution of infection RR 1.16 (95% CI 0.54 to 2.51; 40 participants; 1 trial; low-certainty evidence); undergoing surgical resection RR 1.67 (95% CI 0.47 to 5.90; 40 participants; 1 trial; low-certainty evidence); and sustaining an adverse event (no events in either arm; 81 participants; 2 trials; very low-certainty evidence). Comparison of different topical antimicrobial treatments: We included eight studies with a total of 250 participants, but all of the comparisons were different and no data could be appropriately pooled. Reported outcome data were limited and we are uncertain about the relative effects of antimicrobial topical agents for each of our review outcomes for this comparison, that is wound healing, resolution of infection, surgical resection, and adverse events (all very low-certainty evidence). Topical antimicrobials compared with systemic antibiotics: We included four studies with a total of 937 participants. These studies reported no wound-healing data, and the evidence was uncertain for the relative effects on resolution of infection in infected ulcers and surgical resection (very low certainty). On average, there is probably little difference in the risk of adverse events between the compared topical antimicrobial and systemic antibiotics treatments: RR 0.91 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.06; moderate-certainty evidence - downgraded once for inconsistency). Topical antimicrobial agents compared with growth factor: We included one study with 40 participants. The only review-relevant outcome reported was number of ulcers healed, and these data were uncertain (very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The randomised controlled trial data on the effectiveness and safety of topical antimicrobial treatments for diabetic foot ulcers is limited by the availability of relatively few, mostly small, and often poorly designed trials. Based on our systematic review and analysis of the literature, we suggest that: 1) use of an antimicrobial dressing instead of a non-antimicrobial dressing may increase the number of diabetic foot ulcers healed over a medium-term follow-up period (low-certainty evidence); and 2) there is probably little difference in the risk of adverse events related to treatment between systemic antibiotics and topical antimicrobial treatments based on the available studies (moderate-certainty evidence). For each of the other outcomes we examined there were either no reported data or the available data left us uncertain as to whether or not there were any differences between the compared treatments. Given the high, and increasing, frequency of diabetic foot wounds, we encourage investigators to undertake properly designed randomised controlled trials in this area to evaluate the effects of topical antimicrobial treatments for both the prevention and the treatment of infection in these wounds and ultimately the effects on wound healing.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^1113RHL3]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot infections — empiric initiation, culture guidance, and monitoring: Reliable specimens for cultures may be obtained through curettage of the infected ulcer, and oral antibiotic therapy is usually sufficient as initial therapy. Antimicrobial treatment should be started as soon as possible with an agent providing adequate gram positive coverage, recognizing that gram negative organisms might also be involved. Although the incidence of MRSA infections has increased, methicillin-sensitive S aureus (MSSA) remains the most likely pathogen in community-acquired diabetic foot infections; therefore, initial antibiotic coverage must be tailored to cover MSSA unless culture/sensitivity or pathogen history indicates specific coverage, and antibiotics should be adjusted according to culture results and the patient's response to treatment. While many useful oral agents such as cephalexin, clindamycin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and levofloxacin are available for mild to moderate infections, relatively few have been studied or have demonstrated superiority and IDSA guidelines contain no specific recommendations. All antibiotic treatments should be monitored for development of resistance, and most cases of cellulitis respond within 3 to 5 days of initiation of appropriate antibiotics; if cellulitis is slow to respond, worsens, or recurs following several days of treatment, the ulceration should be reassessed and possibly reevaluated. Bacteria frequently develop resistance, especially with prolonged therapy, which is not uncommon with the quinolones.

### Expert opinion on the management of infections in the diabetic foot [^112Gwk8h]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

This update of the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot incorporates some information from a related review of diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) and a systematic review of the management of infection of the diabetic foot. The pathophysiology of these infections is now well understood, and there is a validated system for classifying the severity of infections based on their clinical findings. Diagnosing osteomyelitis remains difficult, but several recent publications have clarified the role of clinical, laboratory and imaging tests. Magnetic resonance imaging has emerged as the most accurate means of diagnosing bone infection, but bone biopsy for culture and histopathology remains the criterion standard. Determining the organisms responsible for a diabetic foot infection via culture of appropriately collected tissue specimens enables clinicians to make optimal antibiotic choices based on culture and sensitivity results. In addition to culture-directed antibiotic therapy, most infections require some surgical intervention, ranging from minor debridement to major resection, amputation or revascularization. Clinicians must also provide proper wound care to ensure healing of the wound. Various adjunctive therapies may benefit some patients, but the data supporting them are weak. If properly treated, most diabetic foot infections can be cured. Providers practising in developing countries, and their patients, face especially challenging situations.

### Systemic antibiotics for treating diabetic foot infections [^112brUtv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Foot infection is the most common cause of non-traumatic amputation in people with diabetes. Most diabetic foot infections (DFIs) require systemic antibiotic therapy and the initial choice is usually empirical. Although there are many antibiotics available, uncertainty exists about which is the best for treating DFIs.

Objectives

To determine the effects and safety of systemic antibiotics in the treatment of DFIs compared with other systemic antibiotics, topical foot care or placebo.

Search Methods

In April 2015 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE, and EBSCO CINAHL. We also searched in the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE; The Cochrane Library), the Health Technology Assessment database (HTA; The Cochrane Library), the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS-EED; The Cochrane Library), unpublished literature in OpenSIGLE and ProQuest Dissertations and on-going trials registers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of systemic antibiotics (oral or parenteral) in people with a DFI. Primary outcomes were clinical resolution of the infection, time to its resolution, complications and adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data. Risk ratios (RR) were estimated for dichotomous data and, when sufficient numbers of comparable trials were available, trials were pooled in a meta-analysis.

Main Results

We included 20 trials with 3791 participants. Studies were heterogenous in study design, population, antibiotic regimens, and outcomes. We grouped the sixteen different antibiotic agents studied into six categories: 1) anti-pseudomonal penicillins (three trials); 2) broad-spectrum penicillins (one trial); 3) cephalosporins (two trials); 4) carbapenems (four trials); 5) fluoroquinolones (six trials); 6) other antibiotics (four trials). Only 9 of the 20 trials protected against detection bias with blinded outcome assessment. Only one-third of the trials provided enough information to enable a judgement about whether the randomisation sequence was adequately concealed. Eighteen out of 20 trials received funding from pharmaceutical industry-sponsors. The included studies reported the following findings for clinical resolution of infection: there is evidence from one large trial at low risk of bias that patients receiving ertapenem with or without vancomycin are more likely to have resolution of their foot infection than those receiving tigecycline (RR 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 0.99; 955 participants). It is unclear if there is a difference in rates of clinical resolution of infection between: 1) two alternative anti-pseudomonal penicillins (one trial); 2) an anti-pseudomonal penicillin and a broad-spectrum penicillin (one trial) or a carbapenem (one trial); 3) a broad-spectrum penicillin and a second-generation cephalosporin (one trial); 4) cephalosporins and other beta-lactam antibiotics (two trials); 5) carbapenems and anti-pseudomonal penicillins or broad-spectrum penicillins (four trials); 6) fluoroquinolones and anti-pseudomonal penicillins (four trials) or broad-spectrum penicillins (two trials); 7) daptomycin and vancomycin (one trial); 8) linezolid and a combination of aminopenicillins and beta-lactamase inhibitors (one trial); and 9) clindamycin and cephalexin (one trial). Carbapenems combined with anti-pseudomonal agents produced fewer adverse effects than anti-pseudomonal penicillins (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.84; 1 trial). An additional trial did not find significant differences in the rate of adverse events between a carbapenem alone and an anti-pseudomonal penicillin, but the rate of diarrhoea was lower for participants treated with a carbapenem (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.93; 1 trial). Daptomycin produced fewer adverse effects than vancomycin or other semi-synthetic penicillins (RR 0.61, 95%CI 0.39 to 0.94; 1 trial). Linezolid produced more adverse effects than ampicillin-sulbactam (RR 2.66; 95% CI 1.49 to 4.73; 1 trial), as did tigecycline compared to ertapenem with or without vancomycin (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.60; 1 trial). There was no evidence of a difference in safety for the other comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence for the relative effects of different systemic antibiotics for the treatment of foot infections in diabetes is very heterogeneous and generally at unclear or high risk of bias. Consequently it is not clear if any one systemic antibiotic treatment is better than others in resolving infection or in terms of safety. One non-inferiority trial suggested that ertapenem with or without vancomycin is more effective in achieving clinical resolution of infection than tigecycline. Otherwise the relative effects of different antibiotics are unclear. The quality of the evidence is low due to limitations in the design of the included trials and important differences between them in terms of the diversity of antibiotics assessed, duration of treatments, and time points at which outcomes were assessed. Any further studies in this area should have a blinded assessment of outcomes, use standardised criteria to classify severity of infection, define clear outcome measures, and establish the duration of treatment.

Diabetes-related foot infection (DFI) antibiotic selection and dosing — For soft tissue infection, the guideline recommends choosing systemic regimens shown effective in randomized trials and notes that antibiotic dosing for skin and soft tissue infection is usually standard, but therapy for diabetes-related osteomyelitis of the foot (DFO) may require higher doses. We suggest considering beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins – with or without beta-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins, carbapenems), metronidazole (in combination with other antibiotic(s)), clindamycin, linezolid, tetracyclines, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, daptomycin, fluoroquinolones, or vancomycin, but not tigecycline. Data about new combinations of beta-lactams plus beta-lactamase inhibitors and new lipopeptides such as dalbavancin or oritavancin are insufficient to make any recommendation on their use in DFIs, and this new-antibiotic recommendation is conditional, based on moderate evidence.

### Interventions in the management of infection in the foot in diabetes: a systematic review [^111vJ5qQ]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

The optimal approaches to managing diabetic foot infections remain a challenge for clinicians. Despite an exponential rise in publications investigating different treatment strategies, the various agents studied generally produce comparable results, and high-quality data are scarce. In this systematic review, we searched the medical literature using the PubMed and Embase databases for published studies on the treatment of diabetic foot infections as of June 2018. This systematic review is an update of previous reviews, the first of which was undertaken in 2010 and the most recent in 2014, by the infection committee of the International Working Group of the Diabetic Foot. We defined the context of literature by formulating clinical questions of interest, then developing structured clinical questions (PICOs) to address these. We only included data from controlled studies of an intervention to prevent or cure a diabetic foot infection. Two independent reviewers selected articles for inclusion and then assessed their relevant outcomes and the methodological quality. Our literature search identified a total of 15327 articles, of which we selected 48 for full-text review; we added five more studies discovered by means other than the systematic literature search. Among these selected articles were 11 high-quality studies published in the last 4years and two Cochrane systematic reviews. Overall, the outcomes in patients treated with the different antibiotic regimens for both skin and soft tissue infection and osteomyelitis of the diabetic foot were broadly equivalent across studies, except that treatment with tigecycline was inferior to ertapenem (± vancomycin). Similar outcomes were also reported in studies comparing primarily surgical and predominantly antibiotic treatment strategies in selected patients with diabetic foot osteomyelitis. There is insufficient high-quality evidence to assess the effect of various adjunctive therapies, such as negative pressure wound therapy, topical ointments or hyperbaric oxygen, on infection related outcomes of the diabetic foot. In general, the quality of more recent trial designs are better in past years, but there is still a great need for further well-designed trials to produce higher quality evidence to underpin our recommendations.

### Antibiotic stewardship in the management of infected diabetic foot ulcer disease in less developed countries [^116JkcwK]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Approximately 25% of adult patients with diabetics will develop a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) during lifetime. Across the world, probably 40%–60% of all lower limb amputations are related to diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is a major risk for up to one‐quarter of community‐acquired, or healthcare‐associated, orthopaedic infections: even in resource‐rich settings. Diabetic foot problems might be more prevalent in persons with very limited access to professional health care, less medical and diabetes‐related education, malnutrition, lack of glycaemia control or limited financial resources. At a certain level, the prevention, education and the approach to diabetic foot problems need a strong political backup, which is far beyond the preventive interaction between the physician/surgeon and their patient.

In this article, we evaluate easily accessible tools and bedside methods for an efficient and resource‐saving (antibiotic) management of infections (diabetic foot infection [DFI]) in less developed setting, with an emphasis on Africa and issues of antibiotic over use, which is often due to a lack of diagnostic cultures. In contrast, we do not address the individual management of DFI in resource‐rich countries with performant insurance services and accessorily to innovative technologies, well‐equipped hospitals or a specialised health care.

### Diabetic foot infections: current treatment and delaying the 'post-antibiotic era' [^113UTJvi]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment for diabetic foot infections requires properly diagnosing infection, obtaining an appropriate specimen for culture, assessing for any needed surgical procedures and selecting an empiric antibiotic regimen. Therapy will often need to be modified based on results of culture and sensitivity testing. Because of excessive and inappropriate use of antibiotics for treating diabetic foot infections, resistance to the usually employed bacteria has been increasing to alarming levels.

Review

This article reviews recommendations from evidence-based guidelines, informed by results of systematic reviews, on treating diabetic foot infections. Data from the pre-antibiotic era reported rates of mortality of about 9% and of high-level leg amputations of about 70%. Outcomes have greatly improved with appropriate antibiotic therapy. While there are now many oral and parenteral antibiotic agents that have demonstrated efficacy in treating diabetic foot infections, the rate of infection with multidrug-resistant pathogens is growing. This problem requires a multi-focal approach, including providing education to both clinicians and patients, developing robust antimicrobial stewardship programmes and using new diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. Recently, new methods have been developed to find novel antibiotic agents and to resurrect old treatments, like bacteriophages, for treating these difficult infections.

Conclusion

Medical and political leaders have recognized the serious global threat posed by the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. By a multipronged approach that includes exerting administrative pressure on clinicians to do the right thing, investing in new technologies and encouraging the profitable development of new antimicrobials, we may be able to stave off the coming 'post-antibiotic era'.

### Admission avoidance using intramuscular antibiotics for the treatment of borderline foot infections in people with diabetes in a tertiary care foot clinic [^112MTj22]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We have introduced a new standardised initial empirical antibiotic policy that has modified the IDSA guideline. We found that by collaborating within the multidisciplinary diabetes foot clinic team we rationalised the prescribing of antimicrobials at no additional drug cost. This rationalisation has meant that the cost of treatment has stayed relatively unchanged. At the same time we have also simplified the regimes in an attempt to improve patient compliance. Our intramuscular regimen saved over £60,000 in just 23 patients over a period of 22 months. We believe that this is a cost effective strategy for admission avoidance.
