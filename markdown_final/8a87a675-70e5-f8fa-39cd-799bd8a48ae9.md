## Question

2018 Atlanta criteria for acute pancreatitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the 2018 Atlanta criteria for acute pancreatitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether there really is a 2018 version of the Atlanta criteria or if the user means the 2012 revised Atlanta classification. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria and how they are applied. Next, I will review the severity classification, including organ failure definitions and the two-phase model. After that, I should examine the imaging nomenclature for collections and when imaging is indicated. Finally, I will consider prognostic tools, special populations, and how to reconcile any discrepancies between sources, anchoring to high-credibility guidelines and the original consensus document.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I need to ensure we are not propagating a misnomer. There is no 2018 Atlanta classification; the most recent consensus is the 2012 revised Atlanta classification, which was adopted broadly in 2013 and remains the current standard in contemporary guidelines, so the user likely means the 2012 revised Atlanta criteria rather than a 2018 update [^aa9b4831] [^24e09476].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic criteria and make sure I state them precisely. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires at least two of the following three: characteristic abdominal pain, serum amylase or lipase at least three times the upper limit of normal, or characteristic imaging findings; I initially thought imaging was mandatory, but wait, let me verify — imaging is not required to make the diagnosis and is reserved for uncertain cases or lack of clinical improvement, so I should correct that assumption and emphasize that imaging is supportive rather than obligatory for diagnosis [^24e09476] [^1edb62d5].

> I will now examine the severity classification, since this is the core of the revised system. The revised Atlanta classification stratifies severity into three categories: mild, moderately severe, and severe, based on the presence and duration of organ failure and the presence of local or systemic complications; persistent organ failure beyond 48 hours defines severe disease, whereas transient organ failure resolving within 48 hours or local/systemic complications without persistent organ failure define moderately severe disease, and absence of both organ failure and complications defines mild disease [^aa9b4831] [^a73cce4c].

> Hold on, I should verify the organ failure definitions so I do not overgeneralize. Organ failure is typically operationalized using a modified Marshall scoring system across cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal systems, with persistent failure defined as organ dysfunction lasting more than 48 hours; this aligns with the consensus and contemporary guideline tables that list shock, pulmonary insufficiency, renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding thresholds, noting that GI bleeding was later de-emphasized in some pediatric contexts while remaining part of the adult Marshall-based schema [^a73cce4c] [^d276be88].

> Let me consider the two-phase model, because timing influences both classification and imaging. The early phase spans the first week after onset and is dominated by systemic inflammatory response and organ failure risk, whereas the late phase follows the first week and is characterized by local complications such as pseudocysts and walled-off necrosis; this phase-based framework guides when and how to image and intervene, and I should confirm that this biphasic construct is explicitly part of the revised classification, which it is [^aa9b4831] [^42977497].

> Next, I should review the imaging nomenclature for collections, since this is a major update. In interstitial edematous pancreatitis, collections are either acute peripancreatic fluid collections within 4 weeks or pseudocysts after 4 weeks; in necrotizing pancreatitis, collections are either acute necrotic collections within 4 weeks or walled-off necrosis after 4 weeks, and importantly, the terms pseudocyst and abscess are not used for necrotizing disease, which helps standardize reporting and management decisions [^c14f4b09] [^60159117].

> I need to check when imaging is actually indicated, because unnecessary CT early on can mislead. Routine early CT at admission to assess severity is not recommended; CT or MRI is reserved for diagnostic uncertainty, atypical presentations, or failure to improve clinically after 48–72 hours, with contrast-enhanced CT particularly useful after this window to delineate necrosis and complications; ultrasound remains first-line to assess biliary etiology, and MRI is a reasonable alternative when radiation avoidance is desired or in pediatrics [^fa554469] [^bbeff242] [^4fffb8c9].

> Let me think about prognostication, because clinicians often ask which score to use. The revised Atlanta classification itself is a severity framework rather than a prognostic score; for early risk stratification, BISAP is simple, validated, and widely used, while APACHE II and CRP thresholds such as 150 mg/L at 48–72 hours can add prognostic value, though no single score perfectly predicts severe disease, so I should caution against overreliance on any one metric [^b4c97bce] [^72c63485] [^e3556468].

> But wait, what about special populations and edge cases. In pediatrics, the diagnostic criteria are the same, but the INSPIRE criteria are often used for pediatric-specific nuances, and MRI is preferred to avoid radiation; in older adults or those with atypical presentations, I should double-check for biliary obstruction, malignancy, and metabolic causes, and remember that early organ failure carries higher mortality, which reinforces the need for close monitoring in the first 48–72 hours [^71e9b43f] [^4fffb8c9] [^350d03e7].

> I should confirm how to reconcile any discrepancies between sources. If a document cites a 2018 Atlanta criteria, it is likely a typographical error or local adaptation; the authoritative standard remains the 2012 revised Atlanta classification as reflected in high-credibility guidelines, so I would default to those definitions and explicitly note the discrepancy to avoid confusion [^aa9b4831] [^24e09476].

> In summary, the 2012 revised Atlanta classification provides a unified diagnostic and severity framework: diagnose AP with two of three — characteristic pain, enzymes at least three times normal, or imaging — then classify severity by the presence and duration of organ failure and complications; reserve cross-sectional imaging for diagnostic uncertainty or lack of improvement; and use standardized collection nomenclature to guide timing and type of intervention, all within a two-phase disease model that aligns management with pathophysiology and outcomes [^aa9b4831] [^24e09476] [^c14f4b09].

The 2018 Atlanta criteria for acute pancreatitis are the **2012 revised Atlanta classification** [^aa9b4831], which defines acute pancreatitis by **≥ 2 of 3**: characteristic abdominal pain, serum lipase or amylase ≥ 3× ULN, or characteristic imaging findings [^24e09476]. Severity is classified as **mild, moderately severe, or severe** based on the presence and duration of organ failure and local or systemic complications [^a73cce4c]. Mild disease has no organ failure or complications; moderately severe has transient organ failure (< 48 h) or local/systemic complications without persistent organ failure; severe has persistent organ failure (> 48 h) [^aa9b4831]. Imaging is not required for diagnosis but is essential for assessing complications and guiding management, particularly after 48–72 hours [^bbeff242] [^fa554469]. This classification standardizes diagnosis, severity stratification, and reporting worldwide [^c14f4b09].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

The 2018 Atlanta criteria require **≥ 2 of the following 3** for diagnosis:

| **Criterion** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Clinical | Characteristic abdominal pain (acute onset, severe epigastric pain radiating to the back) [^1edb62d5] |
| Biochemical | Serum lipase or amylase ≥ 3× ULN [^b690cbde] |
| Imaging | Characteristic findings on contrast-enhanced CT, MRI, or transabdominal ultrasound [^883ea752] |

---

Imaging is **not mandatory** for diagnosis but is indicated when the diagnosis is uncertain or the patient fails to improve clinically within 48–72 hours [^fa554469].

---

## Classification of severity

The 2018 Atlanta criteria classify severity into **three categories** based on organ failure and complications:

| **Severity** | **Definition** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild | No organ failure or local/systemic complications | Self-limited, resolves within a week [^aa9b4831] |
| Moderately severe | Transient organ failure (< 48 h) or local/systemic complications without persistent organ failure | May require prolonged hospitalization, but low mortality [^09c81bde] |
| Severe | Persistent organ failure (> 48 h) | High mortality, often requires ICU care [^00e9b3d9] |

---

Organ failure is defined by the **modified Marshall scoring system**, assessing cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal systems [^a73cce4c].

---

## Role of imaging

Imaging is **critical** for assessing severity, complications, and guiding interventions:

- **Early phase (≤ 48–72 h)**: Ultrasound for biliary etiology; contrast-enhanced CT or MRI if diagnosis is uncertain or patient deteriorates [^bbeff242].
- **Late phase (> 48–72 h)**: Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI to assess necrosis, collections, and guide interventions [^bbeff242].

---

## Clinical implications

The 2018 Atlanta criteria provide a **standardized framework** for:

- **Diagnosis**: Uniform diagnostic criteria across centers [^aa9b4831].
- **Severity stratification**: Guides level of care, monitoring, and interventions [^24dea4c9].
- **Research**: Enables consistent reporting and comparison of outcomes [^c14f4b09].

---

## Limitations and controversies

Despite widespread adoption, the 2018 Atlanta criteria have **limitations**:

- **Subjectivity**: Some definitions, such as "local complications", remain subjective [^notfound].
- **Predictive accuracy**: Early severity prediction remains challenging, with no single score reliably predicting severe disease [^e3556468].
- **Alternative classifications**: The determinant-based classification (DBC) adds a "critical" category for infected necrosis with persistent organ failure, highlighting heterogeneity in severe disease [^0d48acf2].

---

The 2018 Atlanta criteria are the **2012 revised Atlanta classification**, providing a standardized approach to diagnosing and classifying acute pancreatitis severity. They remain the global standard, guiding clinical decision-making and research despite ongoing debates and evolving alternatives [^aa9b4831].

Background and Objective

The Atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis enabled standardised reporting of research and aided communication between clinicians. Deficiencies identified and improved understanding of the disease make a revision necessary.

Methods

A web-based consultation was undertaken in 2007 to ensure wide participation of pancreatologists. After an initial meeting, the Working Group sent a draft document to 11 national and international pancreatic associations. This working draft was forwarded to all members. Revisions were made in response to comments, and the web-based consultation was repeated three times. The final consensus was reviewed, and only statements based on published evidence were retained.

Results

The revised classification of acute pancreatitis identified two phases of the disease: early and late. Severity is classified as mild, moderate or severe. Mild acute pancreatitis, the most common form, has no organ failure, local or systemic complications and usually resolves in the first week. Moderately severe acute pancreatitis is defined by the presence of transient organ failure, local complications or exacerbation of co-morbid disease. Severe acute pancreatitis is defined by persistent organ failure, that is, organ failure > 48 h. Local complications are peripancreatic fluid collections, pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis (sterile or infected), pseudocyst and walled-off necrosis (sterile or infected). We present a standardised template for reporting CT images.

Conclusions

This international, web-based consensus provides clear definitions to classify acute pancreatitis using easily identified clinical and radiologic criteria. The wide consultation among pancreatologists to reach this consensus should encourage widespread adoption.

### Imaging of acute pancreatitis: update of the revised Atlanta classification [^901aafe2]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammatory process of the pancreatic gland with increasing incidence worldwide. Usually the clinical presentation and course are mild, with an uneventful recovery. In 10% to 20% of patients, however, local and systemic complications develop, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. In 1992, the Atlanta symposium provided definitions for acute pancreatitis and its severity. Insights into the pathophysiology of the disease, improved diagnostic imaging, and implementation of minimally invasive techniques have led to classification updates. This article reviews the cross-sectional imaging features of acute pancreatitis and presents proposed definitions of the revised Atlanta classification.

The clinical calculator "Revised Atlanta classification for acute pancreatitis" for acute pancreatitis.

The Revised Atlanta Classification for Acute Pancreatitis is a clinical scoring system used to classify the severity of acute pancreatitis. This classification system is applicable to patients who present with symptoms suggestive of acute pancreatitis, such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and elevated levels of pancreatic enzymes in the blood.

The Revised Atlanta Classification provides a standardized approach to stratify patients into different severity levels based on clinical and imaging findings. It categorizes acute pancreatitis into two phases: early (first week) and late (after the first week), and further classifies the disease into mild, moderately severe, and severe. This classification helps in predicting the clinical course, management, and prognosis of the disease.

The clinical utility of this calculator lies in its ability to guide clinicians in making decisions about the appropriate level of care, potential need for interventions, and to predict patient outcomes. It also aids in communication between healthcare providers and in research settings.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the Revised Atlanta Classification. However, it should be noted that it is not designed to diagnose acute pancreatitis, but rather to classify the severity of the disease in patients in whom a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis has already been established based on clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings.

The Revised Atlanta Classification for acute pancreatitis assesses the severity of the condition based on user input regarding local or systemic complications and organ failure. The process involves evaluating two main inputs and determining the severity of acute pancreatitis (AP) by categorizing it as mild, moderate, or severe.

Inputs required are:

1. **Local or systemic complications (such as pancreatic necrosis) with options**:
- Absent
- Present

2. **Organ failure with options**:
- Absent
- Transient (resolving in ≤ 48 hours)
- Persistent (> 48 hours; single or multiple)

The inputs are evaluated using a logic-based computation to result in one of the three categories of acute pancreatitis:

- **Mild AP**: Characterized by the absence of both local or systemic complications and organ failure. This is determined if local or systemic complications are absent and organ failure is absent (A and C).

- **Moderate AP**: Defined by the presence of local or systemic complications with no organ failure or transient organ failure, or when complications are absent but organ failure is transient. This is assessed when local or systemic complications are present, and organ failure is absent or transient (B and (C or D)); or when complications are absent and organ failure is transient (A and D).

- **Severe AP**: Identified by the presence of persistent organ failure, irrespective of local or systemic complications. This is recognized when organ failure is persistent (E).

In computation:

- If localOrSystemicComplications is absent and organFailure is absent, the result is Mild AP.
- If localOrSystemicComplications is present and organFailure is absent or transient, or if localOrSystemicComplications is absent and organFailure is transient, the result is Moderate AP.
- If organFailure is persistent, the result is Severe AP.

If all decision conditions are unmet, the output prompts the user to make a selection for all inputs as a result, signaling a missing or incorrect input configuration.

The system systematically evaluates the combination of inputs to place the condition in the appropriate category, thus informing about the severity level of acute pancreatitis. Here is the summary in a table format for clarity:

| **Local or systemic complications** | **Organ failure** | **Result** |
|-|-|-|
| Absent | Absent | Mild AP |
| Present | Absent or Transient | Moderate AP|
| Absent | Transient | Moderate AP|
| Any | Persistent | Severe AP |

### The Atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis revisited [^631d9453]. The British Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

In a complex disease such as acute pancreatitis, correct terminology and clear definitions are important. The clinically based Atlanta Classification was formulated in 1992, but in recent years it has been increasingly criticized. No formal evaluation of the use of the Atlanta definitions in the literature has ever been performed.

Methods

A Medline literature search sought studies published after 1993. Guidelines, review articles and their cross-references were reviewed to assess whether the Atlanta or alternative definitions were used.

Results

A total of 447 articles was assessed, including 12 guidelines and 82 reviews. Alternative definitions of predicted severity of acute pancreatitis, actual severity and organ failure were used in more than half of the studies. There was a large variation in the interpretation of the Atlanta definitions of local complications, especially relating to the content of peripancreatic collections.

Conclusion

The Atlanta definitions for acute pancreatitis are often used inappropriately, and alternative definitions are frequently applied. Such lack of consensus illustrates the need for a revision of the Atlanta Classification.

### Acute pancreatitis: international classification and nomenclature [^f40494d5]. Clinical Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The incidence of acute pancreatitis (AP) is increasing and it is associated with a major healthcare concern. New insights in the pathophysiology, better imaging techniques, and novel treatment options for complicated AP prompted the update of the 1992 Atlanta Classification. Updated nomenclature for pancreatic collections based on imaging criteria is proposed. Adoption of the newly Revised Classification of Acute Pancreatitis 2012 by radiologists should help standardise reports and facilitate accurate conveyance of relevant findings to referring physicians involved in the care of patients with AP. This review will clarify the nomenclature of pancreatic collections in the setting of AP.

### The revised Atlanta classification for acute pancreatitis: a CT imaging guide for radiologists [^2658112f]. Emergency Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis and description of the various findings in acute pancreatitis is important for treatment. The original Atlanta classification for acute pancreatitis sought to create a uniform system for classifying the severity of acute pancreatitis as well as common language to describe the various events that can occur in acute pancreatitis. The goal was to allow accurate communication between physicians using standardized language so correct treatment options could be used. Since that time, advances in the understanding of acute pancreatitis as well as improvements in both interventions and imaging have led to criticisms of the system and its abandonment by physicians. A 2007 revision of the Atlanta classifications sought to address many of these issues. This article will explain the changes to the Atlanta classification system and provide pictorial examples of the findings in acute pancreatitis as described by the Atlanta classification system.

### Managing complicated pancreatitis with more knowledge and a bigger toolbox! [^e3d31337]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Classification of severity of acute pancreatitis

The Atlanta classification of AP was revised in 2012. The working group identified two phases of the disease: early and late, and classified severity as mild, moderate, or severe. Mild AP, the most common form, is characterized by the absence of organ failure, local or systemic complications, and usually resolves within a week. Moderately severe AP is defined by the presence of transient organ failure (lasting < 48 hours) or local complications. Severe AP (SAP) is defined by persistent organ failure lasting > 48 hours. SAP is a systemic disease with two distinct phases. The first phase is sterile systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) that may lead to early primary multiple organ failure and even death within the first 72 hours. The second phase is late secondary organ failure, driven by infection of necrotic tissue or fluid collections. Petrov et al reported that mortality rates for SAP can be as high as 43%. The natural history of AP ranges from complete recovery after a single episode to prolonged hospitalization, requiring multiple invasive interventions, to rapidly progressing multiple organ failure and sepsis leading to death. In some cases, it can progress to a chronic, debilitating condition that persists for decades. The unpredictable clinical course of AP presents challenges, as 80% of patients with mild pancreatitis typically require only a short hospital stay without the need for advanced resources. The remaining 20% with moderately severe to severe pancreatitis require early aggressive treatment, admission to the surgical intensive care unit, or referral to a tertiary center with a multidisciplinary team of specialists. This decision depends on the resources and capabilities of the hospital initially evaluating the patient, but it must also rely on the ability to accurately predict, at the time of admission, which patients with AP will progress. Accurate early predictions are crucial for initiating effective management. Patients with severe AP require intensive care unit monitoring and support for circulatory, pulmonary, renal, and hepatobiliary function to reduce the risk of organ failure sequelae. Those trained in the 1980s recall using Ranson's criteria to prognosticate AP. Since then, numerous prognostic models have been developed, incorporating patient-related risk factors, laboratory parameters, computed tomography (CT) imaging findings, and complex scoring systems to predict mortality, severity of illness, and organ failure. As with many areas of medicine where multiple options are still being studied, no single approach has emerged as definitively superior to others in large-scale comparisons. While there is no 'gold standard' prognostic score for predicting SAP, the Bedside Index of Severity of Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) score is one of the more accurate. Due to its simplicity and the fact that it does not require data from 48 hours after admission, BISAP is particularly applicable in everyday clinical practice. Zhu et al recently published a meta-analysis that comprehensively assessed and compared the performance of Ranson's criteria and BISAP in predicting the severity and prognosis of AP, and found that both were comparable. Several biomarkers have also been studied in recent years. Measurement of serum cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, angiopoietin-2, and resistin have been reported as an accurate method for predicting SAP. Villasante et al recently published their work using machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict severe pancreatitis at a very early stage of the disease without laboratory data or imaging.

Results

Diagnosis

Questions:
Which are the criteria to establish the diagnosis of severe acute pancreatitis?
What is the appropriate imaging work-up in case of suspected severe acute pancreatitis? What is the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan, ultrasound (US), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and other ancillary tests?
Which laboratory parameters should be considered in the diagnostic process?
How do different etiologies affect the diagnostic workup?
Which scores are indicated for risk assessment?
What is the timing and the suitable test for early follow-up imaging?

Statements (severity grading)

Severe acute pancreatitis is associated with persistent organ failure (cardiovascular, respiratory, and/or renal), and high mortality. Both new classification systems, Revised Atlanta Classification and Determinant-based Classification of Acute Pancreatitis Severity, are similar in establishing the diagnosis and severity of acute pancreatitis (1C).
Patients who have persistent organ failure with infected necrosis have the highest risk of death (1C).
Patients with organ failures should be admitted to an intensive care unit whenever possible (1C).

Discussion

Acute pancreatitis (AP) represents a disease characterized by acute inflammation of the pancreas and histologically acinar cell destruction. The diagnosis of AP requires at least the presence of two of the three following criteria: (i) abdominal pain consistent with the disease, (ii) biochemical evidence of pancreatitis (serum amylase and/or lipase greater than three times the upper limit of normal), and (iii) characteristic findings from abdominal imaging.

Most patients (80–85%) will develop a mild disease course (self-limited, mortality < 1–3%), but around 20% will have a moderate or severe episode of AP, with a mortality rate from 13 to 35%. Thus, it is important to diagnose (or better predict) an episode of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), and to identify the patients with high risk of developing complications.

### Treatment options for acute pancreatitis [^cb887008]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

This Review covers the latest developments in the treatment of acute pancreatitis. The Atlanta Classification of acute pancreatitis has been revised, proposing several new terms and abandoning some of the old and confusing terminology. The 2012 Revised Atlanta Classification and the determinant-based classification aim to universally define the different local and systemic complications and predict outcome. The most important differences between these classifications are discussed. Several promising treatment options for the early management of acute pancreatitis have been tested, including the use of enteral nutrition and antibiotics as well as novel therapies such as haemofiltration and protease inhibitors. The results are summarized and the quality of evidence is discussed. Finally, new developments in the management of patients with infected pancreatic necrosis are addressed, including the use of the 'step-up approach' and results of minimally invasive necrosectomy.

### Global survey of controversies in classifying the severity of acute pancreatitis [^1bc487d7]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The need to accurately classify the severity of patients with acute pancreatitis is widely acknowledged but some questions pertinent to this remain debatable. The aim of this study was to benchmark opinions of pancreatologists worldwide with regard to the issues related to classifying the severity of acute pancreatitis.

Methods

An online survey was conducted using an independent commercial service. The corresponding authors of all articles pertinent to clinical aspects of acute pancreatitis published over the last 5 years were invited to participate.

Results

A total of 528 invitations were sent and 240 (45%) responses from 49 countries, representing all the inhabited continents, were received. The Atlanta approach to classifying the severity of acute pancreatitis was considered adequate for modern clinical practice and clinical research by 40 (17%) of the respondents. The determinants-based approach to classifying the severity of acute pancreatitis was considered adequate for modern clinical practice and clinical research by 188 (78%) and 191 (80%) of the respondents, respectively. The definitions of local and systemic determinants of severity were also clarified.

Conclusion

Classifying the severity of acute pancreatitis on the basis of Atlanta approach was considered inadequate by the overwhelming majority of respondents. An international consensus on the new classification of severity of acute pancreatitis has to take into account the results of this survey.

### Acute pancreatitis: revised Atlanta classification and the role of cross-sectional imaging [^763f1c19]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The 2012 revision of the Atlanta Classification emphasizes accurate characterization of collections that complicate acute pancreatitis: acute peripancreatic fluid collections, pseudocysts, acute necrotic collections, and walled-off necroses. As a result, the role of imaging in the management of acute pancreatitis has substantially increased.

Conclusion

This article reviews the imaging findings associated with acute pancreatitis and its complications on cross-sectional imaging and discusses the role of imaging in light of this revision.

### Revised Atlanta classification for acute pancreatitis: a pictorial essay [^c14f4b09]. Radiographics (2016). Low credibility.

The 2012 revised Atlanta classification is an update of the original 1992 Atlanta classification, a standardized clinical and radiologic nomenclature for acute pancreatitis and associated complications based on research advances made over the past 2 decades. Acute pancreatitis is now divided into two distinct subtypes, necrotizing pancreatitis and interstitial edematous pancreatitis (IEP), based on the presence or absence of necrosis, respectively. The revised classification system also updates confusing and sometimes inaccurate terminology that was previously used to describe pancreatic and peripancreatic collections. As such, use of the terms acute pseudocyst and pancreatic abscess is now discouraged. Instead, four distinct collection subtypes are identified on the basis of the presence of pancreatic necrosis and time elapsed since the onset of pancreatitis. Acute peripancreatic fluid collections (APFCs) and pseudocysts occur in IEP and contain fluid only. Acute necrotic collections (ANCs) and walled-off necrosis (WON) occur only in patients with necrotizing pancreatitis and contain variable amounts of fluid and necrotic debris. APFCs and ANCs occur within 4 weeks of disease onset. After this time, APFCs or ANCs may either resolve or persist, developing a mature wall to become a pseudocyst or a WON, respectively. Any collection subtype may become infected and manifest as internal gas, though this occurs most commonly in necrotic collections. In this review, the authors present a practical image-rich guide to the revised Atlanta classification system, with the goal of fostering implementation of the revised system into radiology practice, thereby facilitating accurate communication among clinicians and reinforcing the radiologist's role as a key member of a multidisciplinary team in treating patients with acute pancreatitis.

### Acute pancreatitis: rapid evidence review [^4abb455c]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is the most common gastrointestinal-related reason for hospitalization in the United States. It is diagnosed based on the revised Atlanta classification, with the presence of at least two of three criteria (upper abdominal pain, serum amylase or lipase level greater than three times the upper limit of normal, or characteristic findings on imaging studies). Although computed tomography and other imaging studies can be useful to assess severity or if the diagnosis is uncertain, imaging is not required to diagnose acute pancreatitis. Based on limited studies, several scoring systems have comparable effectiveness for predicting disease severity. The presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome on day 1 of hospital admission is highly sensitive in predicting severe disease. Treatment of acute pancreatitis involves goal-directed fluid resuscitation, analgesics, and oral feedings as tolerated on admission. If oral feedings are not tolerated, nasogastric or nasojejunal feedings are preferred over parenteral nutrition. Cholecystectomy is recommended during the initial admission for patients with mild acute biliary pancreatitis. Medical management is usually sufficient for necrotizing pancreatitis; however, if surgical intervention is needed, a minimally invasive approach is advised over direct endoscopic or open surgical debridement (necrosectomy) because of lower complication rates.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is divided into two types: interstitial edematous and necrotizing. AP severity is classified clinically into mild, moderately severe, and severe, depending on the presence and persistence of organ failure and local or systemic complications. The revised Atlanta classification divides the clinical course of AP into an early (first week) and late phase (after first week) and the clinical phase determines the role of imaging. Imaging has a limited role in the early phase. In the early phase with typical presentations of AP, ultrasound is usually the only appropriate modality and is used for the detection of gallstones. CT and MRI are appropriate in the early phase in equivocal presentations. In the late phase (or at least 48–72 hours after presentation), CT and MRI play a primary role in the imaging of patients with AP for evaluation of etiology, complications, extent of disease, intervention, and follow-up; CT is particularly useful in patients with suspected acute hemorrhage. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Acute pancreatitis: diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment [^724508d2]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Mild acute pancreatitis has a low mortality rate, but patients with severe acute pancreatitis are more likely to develop complications and have a much higher death rate. Although serum amylase and lipase levels remain the most widely used diagnostic assays for acute pancreatitis, other biomarkers and inflammatory mediators such as trypsinogens are being investigated for clinical use. Ranson's criteria, the Imrie scoring system, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scale, and the Computed Tomography Severity Index are systems for classifying severity of this disease; the Atlanta classification is widely used to compare these systems and standardize clinical trials. New developments in imaging modalities such as endoscopic ultrasonography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography increase the options available to physicians for determining the cause of pancreatitis and assessing for complications. Enteral nutrition is preferred to parental nutrition for improving patient outcomes. Clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the role, selection, and timing of antibiotics in patients with infected necrosis.

### Evaluation of four scoring systems in prognostication of acute pancreatitis for elderly patients [^c86a04e5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic criteria

The diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis is determined in accordance with the 2012 revision of the Atlanta classification. The patient should have at least two of the following three diagnostic features:
Consistent abdominal pain with acute pancreatitis.
Serum amylase and/or lipase levels that are at least 3 times higher than the upper limit of the normal range.
Findings of acute pancreatitis on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

According to revised Atlanta classification, the absence of organ failure and local or systemic complications is characterized as mild acute pancreatitis (MAP). The presence of local or systemic complications or transient (less than 48 h) organ failure is characterized as moderately severe acute pancreatitis (MSAP). Persistent (longer than 48 h) organ failure (may be single or multiple organ failure) is characterized as severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).

Organ failure included one or more of the following
Shock/cardiovascular failure: Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg or basal systolic arterial pressure reduced more than 40 mmHg, accompanied with signs of tissue hypoperfusion (lactate larger than 3 mmol/L); saturation of central venous oxygen (SvcO2) less than 70%.
Pulmonary insufficiency: Arterial PO2 less than 60 mmHg in room air or mechanical ventilation required.
Acute renal failure: Serum creatinine level > 2 mg/dl after hemodialysis or rehydration indicating a score no less than 2 according to modified Marshall scoring system.

After the first week of the disease, CECT showing non-enhancement of pancreatic parenchyma was defined as pancreatic necrosis.

Treatment

According to "Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute pancreatitis in China (2013)", the following treatments were given to patients diagnosed with AP:

Nil per oral, early fluid resuscitation (in the first 24 h, the fluid resuscitation dose should be 5–10 ml·kg − 1 ·h − 1), nutritional support (for hemodynamic stability, with enteral nutrition started within 24–48 h if possible), pain control, application of proton pump inhibitor, antibiotic, and somatostatin or its analogues. Organ functional support was given to patients with organ dysfunction (i.e. mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy, or treatment with vasoactive drugs).

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^2b481343]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Almost simultaneously in 2012, two new classifications systems of AP were published: Determinant-Based Classification of Acute Pancreatitis Severity (DBC) and the Revised Atlanta Classification 2012 (RAC). The novel DBC was based on a global web-based survey and a dedicated international symposium with contributors from different disciplines: E-mail invitations were delivered to 528 pancreatologists from 55 countries, and 240 pancreatologists from 49 countries participated in the survey. During the 2011 World Congress of the International Association of Pancreatology (Kochi, India), around 100 participants discussed the proposed classification and tried to agree on the definitions.

The RAC was generated by an iterative, web-based consultation process incorporating responses from the members of 11 national and international pancreatic societies. Revisions were made in response to comments, and the web-based consultation was repeated three times. The final consensus was reviewed, and only statements based on published evidence were retained. The RAC is a broader overview than DBC: in addition to severity classification, it provides a clear definition of diagnosing AP, highlights the onset of pain as an important reference point, and defines individual local complications as well as interstitial and necrotizing pancreatitis. The RAC has three categories: mild, moderately severe, and severe, according to organ failure and local or systemic complications. The DBC added a fourth category: critical, based on two main determinants of mortality: (peri)pancreatic necrosis and organ failure (Table 2).

### Imaging of acute pancreatitis and its complications [^d89bb4b8]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with acute pancreatitis may present with mild or severe disease, the latter comprising a minority of cases but accounting for most of the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is the mainstay of imaging patients with acute pancreatitis and is widely used in both the community and academic settings. A variety of retroperitoneal morphologic changes are readily depicted, and the correct assessment of these abnormalities is imperative for management. The purpose of this review is to describe the imaging evaluation of patients with acute pancreatitis by using the 1992 Atlanta Symposium classification and definitions to describe local complications depicted on contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Correlation with the proposed revision of Atlanta Symposium definitions set forth by the Acute Pancreatitis Working Group will be discussed.

Acute pancreatitis — diagnostic criteria and etiologies specify that diagnosis of AP requires at least 2 features, including characteristic abdominal pain; biochemical evidence with amylase or lipase elevated > 3 times the upper limit of normal; and/or radiographic evidence on cross-sectional imaging. The most common causes remain gallstones and alcohol, which together comprise 80% of cases, and most cases of AP (around 80%) are mild with only interstitial changes without local or systemic complications. Necrotizing pancreatitis is characterized by pancreatic and/or peripancreatic necrosis and is typically seen in patients with moderately severe or severe AP.

Introduction

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a heterogenous condition that has the potential to be life threatening. In 2017, AP resulted in 2770 deaths at a rate of 0.9 per 100 000 in the USA. According to the revised Atlanta Criteria of 2012, AP is classified as mild, moderately severe, and severe. At its worst, AP evolves into infected necrotizing pancreatitis with organ failure which can have a mortality rate of 35%. The most common causes of pancreatitis are gallstone disease and excessive alcohol consumption, however a variety of factors are likely at play with regard to which persons will manifest AP. Because infected necrotizing pancreatitis is an arduous condition to treat, substantial effort is being made to analyze the effectiveness of various treatment strategies with the goal of improving survival and minimizing anatomic and physiological sequelae.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^812a8550]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition of the pancreas most commonly caused by bile stones or excessive use of alcohol. In most patients, the disease takes a mild course, where moderate fluid resuscitation, management of pain and nausea, and early oral feeding result in rapid clinical improvement.

The severe form comprising about 20–30% of the patients is a life-threatening disease with hospital mortality rates of about 15%. The most commonly used classification system for acute pancreatitis is the 2012 revision of the Atlanta classification and definitions based on international consensus. This classification identifies two phases (early and late). Severity is classified as mild, moderate, or severe. The mild form (interstitial edematous pancreatitis) has no organ failure, local or system complications, and usually resolves in the first week. If there is transient (less than 48 h) organ failure, local complications or exacerbation of co-morbid disease, it is classified as moderate. Patients with persistent (more than 48 h) organ failure have the severe form of the disease.

Infection of the pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis occurs in about 20–40% of patients with severe acute pancreatitis, and is associated with worsening organ dysfunctions. In a systematic review and meta-analysis totaling 6970 patients, the mortality rate in patients with infected necrosis and organ failure was 35.2% while concomitant sterile necrosis and organ failure was associated with a mortality of 19.8%. If the patients had infected necrosis without organ failure, the mortality was 1.4%.

According to the updated Atlanta classification 2012, the peripancreatic collections associated with necrosis are acute necrotic collection (ANC) and walled-off necrosis (WON). ANC is a collection seen during the first 4 weeks and containing variable amount of fluid and necrotic tissue involving the pancreatic parenchyma and/or peripancreatic tissues. WON is a mature, encapsulated collection of pancreatic and/or peripancreatic necrosis with a well-defined, enhancing inflammatory wall. The maturation takes usually 4 weeks or more after the onset of acute pancreatitis.

Acute pancreatitis classification (revised Atlanta criteria) — fluid collection entities and definitions are organized by pancreatitis type: interstitial edematous pancreatitis includes Acute (peri)pancreatic fluid collection defined as homogenous fluid adjacent to pancreas without a recognizable wall and Pancreatic pseudocyst defined as an encapsulated, well-defined, usually extrapancreatic fluid collection with minimal solids, while necrotizing pancreatitis includes Acute necrotic collection defined as intra and/or extra pancreatic necrotic collection without a well-defined wall and Walled off necrosis defined as intra and/or extra pancreatic necrotic collection with a well-defined wall.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^4c1dab35]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

During almost 20 years, the 1992 Atlanta Classification has been used, but some of the definitions and the classifications have been confusing. In a revision of 447 articles, Bollen et al. found that alternative definitions of the 1992 Atlanta Classification were used in more than half of the studies, and that definitions are often used erroneously.

Important insights on the management of AP, better understanding of the pathophysiology of organ failure and necrotizing pancreatitis, improved diagnostic imaging, minimally invasive techniques, and studies showing that patients in the severe group of the 1992 Atlanta Classification comprise subgroups with very different outcomes, were indications that a more accurate classification is warranted.

In a review in 2004, Johnson et al. reported that persistent organ failure (POF) for more than 48 h in the first week is strongly associated with the risk of death or local complications. They used a previous database of 290 patients with predicted SAP recruited from 78 hospitals through 18 centers in the UK, and also cited that resolution of organ failure within 48 h suggests a good prognosis.

A retrospective study of 759 patients with AP performed by the University of Edinburgh found that 25.4% of the patients with persistent systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) died, compared with 8% with transient SIRS and 0.7% without SIRS.

These and other studies showed that organ failure is central to the definition of SAP. If organ failure persists for more than 48 h, the patient is at high risk of death (one out of three) and a "severe" category can be established. Also, it is important to remind that a period of illness with a marked inflammatory response (SIRS) preceded the organ failure, and if SIRS is present, the patient is at risk of progression to organ failure, and every attempt should be made to restore normality as soon as possible.

### Determinant-based classification of acute pancreatitis severity: an international multidisciplinary consultation [^0d48acf2]. Annals of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop a new international classification of acute pancreatitis severity on the basis of a sound conceptual framework, comprehensive review of published evidence, and worldwide consultation.

Background

The Atlanta definitions of acute pancreatitis severity are ingrained in the lexicon of pancreatologists but suboptimal because these definitions are based on empiric description of occurrences that are merely associated with severity.

Methods

A personal invitation to contribute to the development of a new international classification of acute pancreatitis severity was sent to all surgeons, gastroenterologists, internists, intensivists, and radiologists who are currently active in clinical research on acute pancreatitis. The invitation was not limited to members of certain associations or residents of certain countries. A global Web-based survey was conducted and a dedicated international symposium was organized to bring contributors from different disciplines together and discuss the concept and definitions.

Result

The new international classification is based on the actual local and systemic determinants of severity, rather than description of events that are correlated with severity. The local determinant relates to whether there is (peri)pancreatic necrosis or not, and if present, whether it is sterile or infected. The systemic determinant relates to whether there is organ failure or not, and if present, whether it is transient or persistent. The presence of one determinant can modify the effect of another such that the presence of both infected (peri)pancreatic necrosis and persistent organ failure have a greater effect on severity than either determinant alone. The derivation of a classification based on the above principles results in 4 categories of severity-mild, moderate, severe, and critical.

Conclusions

This classification is the result of a consultative process amongst pancreatologists from 49 countries spanning North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Oceania, and Africa. It provides a set of concise up-to-date definitions of all the main entities pertinent to classifying the severity of acute pancreatitis in clinical practice and research. This ensures that the determinant-based classification can be used in a uniform manner throughout the world.

Conclusions

These guidelines present evidence-based international consensus statements on the management of severe acute pancreatitis from collaboration of a panel of experts. It contains 55 statements on diagnosis, management in the ICU, surgical and operative management, open abdomen, and antibiotic treatment. For some of the statements such as severity grading, imaging, use of prophylactic antibiotics and most aspect of the management in the ICU, the evidence is strong. For others, such as laboratory diagnostics and surgical strategies, for example, the evidence is quite weak requiring further studies. With accumulating knowledge, the statements need to be regularly updated.

What is new in the assessment of severity?

The original Ranson criteria from 1974, last modified in 2012, have been followed by several new and in part much more complex scoring systems; however, these have only increased diagnostic performance modestly (AUC from 0.57 to 0.74). Recent findings suggest that the presence of under- or overweight, development or persistence of organ failure, and assessment of biomarkers, such as cytokine levels might help to further improve identification of high-risk patients (Fig. 1).

### Atlanta, revised Atlanta, and determinant-based classification – application in a cohort of Portuguese patients with acute pancreatitis [^49e395a9]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute pancreatitis (AP) represents a complex and potentially fatal disease with a highly variable clinical course. Three classification systems for assessing the severity in AP have been validated for clinical use.

Aims

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the performance of the Atlanta and Determinant-based classifications in predicting severe clinical outcomes in patients with AP.

Methods

In this retrospective study we reviewed the treatment and follow-up records of 525 patients with AP admitted to our unit between the years of 2003 and 2014. Outcomes included mortality, admission to the ICU, need for interventional procedures or nutritional support, and duration of hospital and ICU stay.

Results

The prevalence of organ failure and persistent organ failure in our cohort was 23.0 and 10.7%, respectively, and the mortality rate was 5.9%. Higher grades of severity were associated with worse outcomes in all classification systems. The revised Atlanta and Determinant-based classifications performed similarly in predicting outcomes, and both proved to be superior to the former classic Atlanta classification.

Conclusion

Recent classifications proved to be more accurate in predicting important clinical outcomes in patients with AP.

### Acute pancreatitis [^8805c09c]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is most commonly caused by gallstones or chronic alcohol use, and accounts for more than 200,000 hospital admissions annually. Using the Atlanta criteria, acute pancreatitis is diagnosed when a patient presents with two of three findings, including abdominal pain suggestive of pancreatitis, serum amylase and/or lipase levels at least three times the normal level, and characteristic findings on imaging. It is important to distinguish mild from severe disease because severe pancreatitis has a mortality rate of up to 30%. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is considered the diagnostic standard for radiologic evaluation of acute pancreatitis because of its success in predicting disease severity and prognosis. The BALI and computed tomography severity index scores also can aid in determining disease severity and predicting the likelihood of complications. Treatment begins with pain control, hydration, and bowel rest. In the first 48 to 72 hours of treatment, monitoring is required to prevent morbidity and mortality associated with worsening pancreatitis. When prolonged bowel rest is indicated, enteral nutrition is associated with lower rates of complications, including death, multiorgan failure, local complications, and systemic infections, than parenteral nutrition. In severe cases involving greater than 30% necrosis, antibiotic prophylaxis with imipenem/cilastatin decreases the risk of pancreatic infection. In gallstone-associated pancreatitis, early cholecystectomy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with sphincterotomy can decrease length of hospital stay and complication rates. A multidisciplinary approach to care is essential in cases involving pancreatic necrosis.

### Updated imaging nomenclature for acute pancreatitis [^883ea752]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Key points. 1. CT is used to confirm the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis when the diagnosis is in doubt and to differentiate acute interstitial pancreatitis from necrotizing pancreatitis, which is a key element of the updated Atlanta nomenclature. The acute interstitial variety accounts for 90–95% of cases, with acute necrotizing pancreatitis accounting for the remaining cases. 2. Necrosis due to acute pancreatitis is best assessed on IV contrast-enhanced CT performed 40 seconds after injection. Peripancreatic necrosis is a subtype of necrotizing pancreatitis in which tissue death occurs in peripancreatic tissues. This is seen in isolation in 20% of patients with necrotizing pancreatitis. 3. Simple fluid collections associated with acute interstitial pancreatitis are subdivided chronologically. A collection observed within approximately 4 weeks of acute pancreatitis onset is termed an "acute peripancreatic fluid collection (APFC)". A collection older than 4 weeks should have a thin wall and is termed a "pseudocyst". Both APFCs and pseudocysts can be infected or sterile. 4. Fluid collections associated with necrotizing pancreatitis are labeled on the basis of age and the presence of a capsule. Within 4 weeks of acute pancreatitis onset, a fluid collection associated with necrotizing pancreatitis is termed an "acute necrotic collection (ANC)" whereas an older collection is termed an area of "walled-off necrosis (WON)" if it has a perceptible wall on CT. The term "pseudocyst" is not used in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis collections. Although an ANC and a (WON can be infected or sterile, infection is far more likely compared with acute interstitial pancreatitis collections. 5. The severity of acute pancreatitis is graded on the basis of the presence of acute complications or organ failure. Mild acute pancreatitis has neither acute complications nor organ failure. Moderate-severity acute pancreatitis is associated with acute complications or organ failure lasting fewer than 48 hours. Severe acute pancreatitis is characterized by single- or multiorgan failure persisting for greater than 48 hours.

### Moderately severe and severe acute pancreatitis: a systematic review of the outcomes in the USA and European union-5 [^7a8ab940]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute pancreatitis (AP) involves acute inflammation of the pancreas and, sometimes, adjacent tissues. The occurrence of the condition has been increasing during the last 40 years, with incidence rates ranging from 20 to 80 per 100 000 per annum and varying across countries. The proportion of Japan's population, for example, diagnosed in 2011 was estimated at 49.4 per 100 000, representing a 1.8-fold increase over the previous decade. A lower incidence estimate of AP hospital admissions has been reported in Europe. In Scotland, the incidence of AP hospital admissions was estimated at 33.1 per 100 000 per year between 2009 and 2012. This, coupled with the rising global epidemiological burden of AP, helps to account for why the condition is a major consumer of healthcare resources and a significant driver of costs. AP accounted for 275 000 hospital admissions and US$2.6 billion in direct treatment costs in 2009 in the USA, where it is one of the leading gastrointestinal diseases.

AP can rapidly progress into moderately severe AP (MSAP) or severe AP (SAP), and there is a lack of standard care of treatment for AP or SAP. Therefore, early clinical recognition of AP is crucial to managing disease progression — evidence shows that after the initial 48–72 hours, the progression of disease may be fully established, leading to multisystem organ failure (OF). Historically, however, inconsistencies in defining and categorising the severity of AP have presented a challenge in this regard and have complicated the delivery of appropriate care to patients with this potentially life-threatening condition. Against this background, the revised Atlanta classification (RAC) of AP was proposed in 2012to address confusion and related variation in classifying AP severity. The RAC defined and classified populations into the following three groups, with persistent OF being the main determinant of severity: mild AP (when no OF or local or systemic complications are present); MSAP (when OF is present and resolves within 48 hours and/or local or systemic complications are present but without persistent OF) and SAP (when OF persists over 48 hours). This classification considers a biphasic natural course of AP, specifically, an early phase in which the presence or absence of persistent OF is determined, and a late phase in which local or systemic complications are investigated.

### Incidence of recurrent and chronic pancreatitis after acute pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^aa3fc000]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

In our systematic review and meta-analysis, we followed the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 Statement. We registered our meta-analysis protocol on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO registration number CRD42021283252), and we fully adhered to it.

Search strategy

We systematically searched three major medical databases: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), and EMBASE on 19 December 2023, restricting our search to articles published after 1992, with the following search key: acute AND (chronic OR recurrent) AND pancreatitis.

Eligibility criteria

To identify all eligible studies, we used the condition–context–population (CoCoPop) framework. We included all the studies reporting on (1) patients diagnosed with AP according to the Atlanta Classification(in the presence of two of the following three criteria: abdominal pain consistent with the disease, serum amylase, or lipase more than three times the upper limit of normal, and characteristic findings on abdominal imaging); (2) the proportion of RAP or CP in patients after first or multiple episodes of AP. Our primary outcomes were the IRs of RAP and CP after the first AP and the IR of CP after RAP. Our secondary outcomes were the cumulative incidences, and the proportion of RAP and CP after the first AP and the proportion of CP after RAP. We used articles where consecutive patients with the first AP episode were included to calculate RAP. We used two types of articles to calculate CP, but we analyzed them separately: (1) articles with consecutive patients with first AP; (2) articles with consecutive patients with RAP. The use of 'AP' in the manuscript refers to patients with a first episode of AP in every case. There were no restrictions regarding minimum follow-up duration; the minimum study population were 10. We excluded conference abstracts, case reports, review articles, in vitro, and animal studies.

### Recurrent acute pancreatitis: international state-of-the-science conference with recommendations [^724ec015]. Pancreas (2018). Low credibility.

Recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) is a clinically significant problem globally. The etiology remains unclear in approximately 10% to 15% of patients despite a thorough workup. Data on natural history and efficacy of treatments are limited. We aimed to establish criteria for diagnosis, evaluate the causative factors, and arrive at a consensus on the appropriate workup and management of patients with RAP. The organizing committee was formed, and a set of questions was developed based on the current evidence, controversies, and topics that needed further research. After a vetting process, these topics were assigned to a group of experts from around the world with special interest in RAP. Data were presented as part of a workshop on RAP organized as a part of the annual meeting of the America Pancreatic Association. Pretest and Posttest questions were administered, and the responses were tabulated by the current Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. The consensus guidelines were established in the format of a diagnostic algorithm. Several deficiencies were identified with respect to data on etiology, treatment efficacies, and areas that need immediate research.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^1edb62d5]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) — diagnostic criteria and early CT use: Diagnosis is most often established by identification of 2 of the 3 criteria — abdominal pain consistent with the disease, serum amylase and/or lipase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, and/or characteristic findings from abdominal imaging. Patients with AP typically present with epigastric or left upper quadrant pain that is usually constant with radiation to the back, chest, or flanks, whereas pain described as dull, colicky, or located in the lower abdominal region is not consistent with AP and suggests an alternative etiology. Abdominal imaging is often helpful to determine the diagnosis of AP in patients with atypical presentations. Due to limitations on sensitivity and negative predictive value, serum amylase alone cannot be used reliably for the diagnosis of AP, and serum lipase is preferred. Regarding early imaging, "We suggest that early at/admission routine computed tomography (CT) not be performed for the purpose of determining severity in AP and should be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear or who fail to improve clinically within the first 48–72 hours after hospital admission and intravenous hydration".

### Acute pancreatitis imaging in MDCT: state of the art of usual and unusual local complications. 2012 Atlanta classification revisited [^dbe84e6a]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease in which most common etiologies are biliary lithiasis and alcoholism. Acute pancreatitis can be classified into 2 groups according to its morphologic features: interstitial edematous pancreatitis and necrotizing acute pancreatitis. The prognosis of this group of diseases and its complications varies significantly and contrast-enhanced computed tomography is the imaging study of choice for the diagnosis and detection of complications. In this review, we aim to summarize the changes introduced in the revised Atlanta classification and describe other usual and unusual local complications of acute pancreatitis that are not analyzed in that classification. We will also describe early detection signs and provide an accurate interpretation of complications on contrast-enhanced computed tomography that will lead to prompt management decisions which can reduce the morbidity and mortality of these patients.

### Is serum albumin a pivotal biomarker in anticipating acute pancreatitis outcomes? [^7eb110ff]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Design of the study and population

This is a retrospective study conducted over a 5-year period, from January 2018 to December 2023, at the Mohammed VI University Hospital in Oujda, Morocco. The research question was defined prior to the commencement of the study, focusing on the significance of serum albumin levels within 24 h of hospital admission in patients diagnosed with AP.

Diagnosis and classification of AP

The diagnostic align with the 2012 revision of the Atlanta classification, requiring the presence of two or more of the following three criteria:

Abdominal pain consistent with AP.
Imaging findings from contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or abdominal ultrasonography characteristic of AP.
Serum amylase and/or lipase elevation ≥ three times the upper limit of normal.

Exclusion criteria comprised the following

Patients younger than 16 years old.
Unavailable laboratory measurements or medical records.
Conditions with an underlying pathology that could affect serum albumin levels, including but not limited to malabsorption syndromes, chronic pancreatitis, liver cirrhosis, chronic renal disease, albuminuria, nephrotic syndrome, severe malnutrition, and inflammatory bowel disease. At our center, routine checks for albuminuria are conducted as part of the comprehensive evaluation for patients with acute pancreatitis.

Cutoff for hypoalbuminemia

A cutoff value of 30 g/L for albumin levels was employed for grouping, and this threshold aligns with values used in prior studies.

Scoring systems employed to evaluate severity (Table 1):

### Necrotizing pancreatitis: diagnosis, imaging, and intervention [^a1e268e5]. Radiographics (2014). Low credibility.

Acute necrotizing pancreatitis is a severe form of acute pancreatitis characterized by necrosis in and around the pancreas and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Although acute interstitial edematous pancreatitis is diagnosed primarily on the basis of signs, symptoms, and laboratory test findings, the diagnosis and severity assessment of acute necrotizing pancreatitis are based in large part on imaging findings. On the basis of the revised Atlanta classification system of 2012, necrotizing pancreatitis is subdivided anatomically into parenchymal, peripancreatic, and combined subtypes, and temporally into clinical early (within 1 week of onset) and late (> 1 week after onset) phases. Associated collections are categorized as "acute necrotic" or "walled off" and can be sterile or infected. Imaging, primarily computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, plays an essential role in the diagnosis of necrotizing pancreatitis and the identification of complications, including infection, bowel and biliary obstruction, hemorrhage, pseudoaneurysm formation, and venous thrombosis. Imaging is also used to help triage patients and guide both temporizing and definitive management. A "step-up" method for the management of necrotizing pancreatitis that makes use of imaging-guided percutaneous catheter drainage of fluid collections prior to endoscopic or surgical necrosectomy has been shown to improve clinical outcomes. The authors present an algorithmic approach to the care of patients with necrotizing pancreatitis and review the use of imaging and interventional techniques in the diagnosis and management of this pathologic condition.

### Recurrence of idiopathic acute pancreatitis after cholecystectomy: systematic review and meta-analysis [^f2984c35]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

This review was written in accordance with PRISMA 11 and MOOSE guidelines 12, and was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42017055275).

Definitions

Data were analysed based on the definitions of IAP as outlined in the original articles, and according to current guidelines 13, which define IAP as acute pancreatitis in which no aetiology can be determined by standard diagnostic evaluation, consisting of a detailed history, laboratory serum tests (liver enzymes, calcium and triglycerides) and imaging (transabdominal ultrasonography on admission and repeated after discharge).

Three types of IAP were defined for the purposes of this study. First, 'original' IAP was defined in accordance with definitions used in the original articles. Second, 'presumed' IAP was defined by diagnosis of IAP after the standard evaluation. Third, 'true' IAP was defined as an acute pancreatitis episode that remained unexplained after both standard diagnostic work‐up and additional diagnostic tests such as EUS and MRCP (Fig. 1).

Figure 1
Diagnostic process and definitions

Outcome measures

The primary outcome was recurrence rate of acute pancreatitis, calculated as the proportion of patients experiencing one or multiple episodes of recurrent acute pancreatitis after an index episode of 'original', 'presumed' or 'true' IAP.

Secondary outcomes were complications of cholecystectomy, severity of recurrences as defined by the revised Atlanta classification 14, and occurrence of biliary events before cholecystectomy.

Search strategy

Guided by an experienced librarian, the PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases were searched systematically for relevant articles published between inception and 1 September 2018 (Appendix S1, supporting information). Search terms included 'pancreatitis', 'idiopathic' and 'cholecystectomy'. Studies of adult humans in English were considered. Duplicates were removed and the search results were recorded using the Covidence systematic review software (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia).

### Macrophage migration inhibitory factor is an early marker of severe acute pancreatitis based on the revised Atlanta classification [^09c81bde]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common digestive disease with the potential to cause significant morbidity and mortality. The incidence of AP ranges from 5 to 30 cases per 100,000, and admissions have increased by at least 15% over the past 10 years. AP can be categorized into mild acute pancreatitis (MAP), moderately severe acute pancreatitis (MSAP), and severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) according to the revised Atlanta classification (RAC). The majority of cases (> 80%) is MAP, which is characterized by only interstitial changes of the pancreas without local or systemic complications, and the mortality is quite low. MSAP is characterized by local complications or transient organ failure (< 48 h), with a mortality of less than 5%. However, SAP is characterized with persistent failures of one or more organ system (respiratory, cardiovascular, or renal), and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, early identification of those who would progress to the severe category could allow the physicians to monitor more closely and put more medical resources.

Definition of severity in acute pancreatitis

Subsequently, Bansal et al. in a cohort of 248 patients found that RAC and DBC are similar in ICU admission, need of percutaneous drainage, need for surgery, and in-hospital mortality. The critical category in DBC identified the most severe disease. Nawaz et al. enrolled prospectively 256 patients, and assigned a severity category for all three classifications: RAC, DBC, and Atlanta 1992. They found that RAC and DBC severity categories accurately reflected clinical outcomes and were superior to Atlanta 1992 (evaluating mortality, ICU admission, ICU length of stay).

Two years later, a retrospective study of 395 patients in China, with an overall 8.9% in-hospital mortality, found similar results. The authors found that all three classification systems (RAC, BDC, and Atlanta 1992) accurately classify the severity of AP. However, the RAC and the DBC performed better than the Atlanta 1992, and they were comparable in predicting long-term clinical prognosis, major complications, and clinical interventions.

Choi et al. studying 553 patients with AP admitted to a single center during the 7-year period, validated the RAC correlating well with clinical outcome, despite not considering infected necrosis. However, patients in the severe group and with infected necrosis (classified as critical in DBC) should be considered separately from those without it (the mortality rate increased fourfold: up to 32%). Another study analyzed 543 episodes of AP from 459 patients in a prospective cohort of patients. They found that the different categories of severity for each classification system were associated with statistically significant and clinically relevant differences in length of hospital stay, need for admission to the intensive care unit, nutritional support, invasive treatment, and in-hospital mortality. In addition, the direct comparison between categories of both classifications (after unifying the severe and critical category of the DBC) yielded no significant differences.

In general, patients with organ failure (accurately defined utilizing one of the established criteria or scoring systems) need an urgent transfer to an ICU. Accordingly, it may be unnecessary to transfer patients with transient organ failure to either a tertiary medical center or an ICU. Nevertheless, to confirm persistent organ failure, it needs to be documented for over 48 h.

### Magnetic resonance imaging glossary of findings of pediatric pancreatitis and the revised Atlanta classification [^b3c6bdca]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

While still uncommon, the incidence of acute pancreatitis in children has been increasing over the last two decades. The Atlanta classification for acute pancreatitis, developed for adults, stratifies cases of acute pancreatitis based on imaging and clinical criteria. This classification scheme allows for standardized use of terminology to facilitate treatment and prognostication. Although US and CT should be used in critical or unstable patients, MRI is an ideal imaging modality in pediatric patients with acute pancreatitis because of its ability to characterize tissue without ionizing radiation. We review MRI examples specific to Atlanta classification terminology in pediatric patients. Chronic pancreatitis has also been increasingly diagnosed in children, and imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis and management of this insidious disease. MRI with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is the optimal modality for assessing the pancreas in a child with known or suspected chronic pancreatitis because it provides tissue characterization and high-contrast imaging of the pancreatic duct without the use of invasive instrumentation or ionizing radiation. We also review and demonstrate accepted MRI findings of chronic pancreatitis.

Methods

Patients

Patients with AP from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2019 who underwent treatment at the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University were included in this retrospective study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) definitively diagnosed AP; 2) aged between 18 and 70 years; 3) onset time of no more than 72 h; 4) Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score ≥ 8 or C-reactive protein level (CRP) ≥ 150 mg/L; and 4) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) performed at the request of the patient. Exclusion criteria were: 1) pregnancy or lactation; 2) acute attack of chronic pancreatitis; 3) severe heart, lung, liver, kidney, and mental diseases that may impair AP treatment effect; 4) inability to cooperate during ERCP, NYHA cardiac function > III, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), creatinine (Cr) clearance rate of chronic kidney disease < 40 mL/min, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients who required long-term oxygen therapy, and patients with chronic liver disease with Child-Pugh liver function grade C, coagulation dysfunction or long-term oral anticoagulants, or the agonal phase; 5) patients with immune disorders or immunosuppression; 6) patients who cannot tolerate PD stenting for various reasons, such as hypersensitivity to contrast media, severe fundal oesophageal varices, upper digestive tract obstruction, ulcer, or bleeding; 7) malignant tumours of the biliary and pancreatic systems affecting the therapeutic effect; 8) refusal by the patient or family member; and 9) patients with other diseases requiring simultaneous surgical treatment. Ultimately, 131 patients (88 males and 43 females) who met the above criteria were classified into two groups according to whether they underwent PD stenting or not. The criteria for diagnosing and classifying AP were based on the 2012 Atlanta criteria.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis" for acute pancreatitis and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.

The diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis serve as a clinical tool for the identification and confirmation of this condition in patients presenting with relevant symptoms. The primary purpose of these criteria is to facilitate accurate diagnosis, thereby enabling timely and appropriate treatment.

The diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis are based on three primary components: abdominal pain, elevated levels of lipase or amylase, and characteristic findings on imaging studies such as CT or MRI. The abdominal pain associated with acute pancreatitis is typically acute in onset, persistent, severe, and located in the epigastric region, often radiating to the back. The second component involves a significant increase in the levels of pancreatic enzymes, specifically lipase or amylase, to more than three times the upper limit of normal. The third component involves the identification of characteristic findings indicative of acute pancreatitis on CT or MRI scans.

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is confirmed if two of the three criteria are met. These combinations can be either the presence of abdominal pain and elevated enzyme levels, elevated enzyme levels and characteristic imaging findings, or abdominal pain and characteristic imaging findings. If these combinations are not met, the diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis are not fulfilled. This approach ensures a high degree of diagnostic accuracy while allowing for some variability in clinical presentation.

This tool helps determine if the diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis are met. It guides users through selecting relevant clinical features and automatically evaluates these selections.

Here's how the process unfolds:

Diagnosis hinges on three critical indicators:

- Abdominal pain is described as acute, persistent, severe, and primarily in the epigastric region, typically extending to the back.
- Levels of the enzymes lipase or amylase are three times higher than the normal maximum.
- Imaging via CT or MRI shows findings characteristic of pancreatitis.

Using these criteria, the calculator assesses whether the combination of any two of these factors is present:

- If the abdominal pain and elevated enzyme levels are reported, or
- If elevated enzyme levels and characteristic imaging findings are observed, or
- If abdominal pain and characteristic imaging findings are noted.

The diagnostic conclusion is simple:

- If any two out of the three key indicators coincide, the tool concludes that the diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis are met.
- If fewer than two criteria are present, the criteria are not satisfied.

This straightforward evaluation ensures users can easily understand if the combination of clinical symptoms aligns with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

Inclusion criteria

After removing duplicate records from the different databases, two independent reviewers (XWL and CHW) selected the included studies based on the following PICOS criteria: (1) Participants: Adults with AP. The diagnosis of AP should be based on two of the following criteria developed by the Atlanta international symposium and revised Atlanta classification: a.) Abdominal pain consistent with AP (e.g. acute onset of persistent, severe, epigastric pain often radiating to the back); b.) Serum lipase or amylase activity at least three times greater than the upper limit of normal; or c.) Classic image findings from computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or abdominal ultrasonography. We defined the severity of AP based on the Atlanta international symposium and revised Atlanta classification. For example, mild AP is defined by the absence of organ failure and local or systemic complications, and moderately severe AP is defined by the presence of transient organ failure or local or systemic complications. We classified mild and moderately severe AP into the non-severe AP group, because severe AP, characterized by persistent organ failure, may pose a higher mortality risk; (2) Interventions: aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation, defined as a.) Fluid administration (predominantly normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution) at a rate greater than 10 ml/kg/hour as the initial management; b.) Fluid bolus 20 ml/kg for 2 h, then 2–3 ml/kg/hour in the first 24 h; c.) Isotonic crystalloid > 500 ml/hour for the first 12–24 h. If the RCTs did not report the fluid infusion rate in the study protocols, the crystalloid fluid administration should be greater than 4000 mL in the first 24 h; (3) Comparisons: non-aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation, defined as a.) Fluid administration at a rate lower than 10 ml/kg/hour; b.) Fluid bolus 10 ml/kg for 2 h; then, 1.5 ml/kg/hour in the first 24 h or c.) Isotonic crystalloid < 500 ml/hour for the first 12–24 h. If the RCTs did not report the fluid infusion rate in the study protocols, the crystalloid fluid administration should be less than 4000 mL in the first 24 h; (4) Primary outcome: all-cause mortality. Other secondary outcomes, such as the rate of clinical improvement (based on the objective parameters, including systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) subsides and time period therefore, decrease in hematocrit (Hct), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine from baseline, and subjective measurements, including decrease in epigastric pain degree, assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) and tolerance of oral nutrition within 48 h) in non-severe AP and the changes of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores and Multiple Organ Dysfunction (MOD) scores for severe AP, fluid-related complications, such as abdominal compartment syndrome, pulmonary/peripheral edema and any sign of volume overload (e.g. rapid weight gain, incident ascites or jugular vein engorgement), as defined by previous guidelines, sepsis, acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, pancreatic necrosis, SIRS subsiding within 48 h, SIRS persisting > 48 h, persistent organ failure (any organ failure > 48 h), defined by the revised Atlanta classification and total hospitalization days were also evaluated if they were reported in the included studies. Specifically, decrease in epigastric pain may be related to better prognosis of AP and better subjective perception of quality of life for patients. In addition, we included APACHE II score changes as the clinical prognosis parameter, based on the suggestions of the ACG guidelines, and the prediction performance of poor outcome in severe AP has been validated. We also evaluated the Hct and BUN changes within 48 h, because these parameters have been considered as surrogate markers for successful hydration for AP; (5) Designs: RCTs. In cases of disagreement over study selection, the senior author (SCS) made the final decision.

### Drug-induced acute pancreatitis in adults: an update [^de7fc497]. Pancreas (2019). Medium credibility.

Drug-induced acute pancreatitis (DIAP) is a rare entity that is often challenging for clinicians. The aim of our study was to provide updated DIAP classes considering the updated definition of acute pancreatitis (AP) and in light of new medications and new case reports. A MEDLINE search (1950–2018) of the English language literature was performed looking for all adult (≥ 17 years old) human case reports with medication/drug induced as the cause of AP. The included case reports were required to provide the name of the drug, and diagnosis of AP must have been strictly established based on the revised Atlanta Classification criteria. A total of 183 medications were found to be implicated in 577 DIAP cases. A total of 78 cases were excluded because of minimal details or lack of definite diagnosis of AP. Drug-induced AP is rare, and most drugs cause mild DIAP. Only 2 drugs are well described in the literature to explain causation rather than association (azathioprine and didanosine). Larger case-control studies and a formal standardized DIAP reporting system are essential to study the true potential of the DIAP-implicated drugs described in this review.

### Validation of the revised Atlanta criteria in determining the severity of acute pancreatitis [^d5ce75c8]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background/Aim

Determining the severity of acute pancreatitis (AP) is crucial for patient management. The aim of our study was to assess the accuracy and limitations of the Revised Atlanta Criteria (RAC) in determining the severity of AP.

Materials and Methods

The study was retrospectively conducted on AP patients admitted to the Gastroenterology Department of Sakarya University Faculty of Medicine. The severity, morphology and local complications of AP were evaluated according to the RAC. Laboratory parameters, clinical scores predicting disease severity and Computer Tomography Severity Index scores were assessed.

Results

The study group included 113 patients. Ninety-eight (86.7%) had interstitial edematous, and 15 (13.3%) had necrotizing pancreatitis. AP pancreatitis was mild in 69 (61.1%), moderate in 33 (29.2%), and severe in 11 (9.7%). Compared to the moderate group, patients in the severe group had a higher hematocrit, creatinine, SIRS and BISAP scores at admission and more length of hospital stay, more ICU requirements, and higher mortality rates (P < 0.05). Eleven patients had single or multiple persistent organ failure (POF). The mortality rate of patients who developed early POF (n = 6) was higher compared to the group of patients who developed late POF (n = 2) (83.3% and 40%, respectively).

Conclusion

Severity assessment using the RAC in patients with AP is consistent with laboratory parameters and scoring systems predicting severity. Severe pancreatitis cases who develop early POF may be classified separately.

### Prevalence and predictors of severity as defined by Atlanta criteria among patients presenting with acute pancreatitis [^350a18b5]. Pancreas (2003). Low credibility.

Introduction

Effective triage of patients with acute pancreatitis is dependent on the ability to accurately predict a severe course. Predictors (e.g. APACHE II score of > 8) have been tested against wide-ranging definitions of severity (prevalence, 15%-40%). To ensure uniformity in defining a severe course of acute pancreatitis, the Atlanta symposium of 1992 adopted all-encompassing criteria (local complications, systemic complications, need for surgery, or death).

Aims

To assess the prevalence of each Atlanta criteria for severe acute pancreatitis and to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the APACHE II score as a predictor of these criteria for severe acute pancreatitis.

Methodology

We reviewed records of patients admitted to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (Cincinnati, OH, U.S. A.) between 1994 and 1998 with acute pancreatitis. Exclusion criteria included referral from an outside hospital, immunocompromised state, and chronic pancreatitis.

Results

Seventy-four consecutive patients met our inclusion criteria. Ten patients (13.5%) had a severe course. Seven patients developed only local complications. Three patients had systemic complications. Pancreatic surgical intervention was required in four patients. No deaths occurred. An APACHE II score of > 8 exhibited 50% sensitivity and 69% specificity (positive predictive value, 20%; negative predictive value, 89%). All patients with systemic complications and two of seven patients with only local complications had an APACHE II score of > 8.

Conclusions

The prevalence of severity among our nonreferred patients with acute pancreatitis was less than previously reported. The APACHE II scoring system exhibited reasonable sensitivity in predicting systemic complications and/or the need for surgery, with a low positive predictive value. This most certainly is a function of the low pretest probability of severe pancreatitis. Future studies attempting to identify predictive systems that triage patients in a more cost-effective manner should restrict their analysis to Atlanta criteria other than local complications.

### Toward an update of the Atlanta classification on acute pancreatitis: review of new and abandoned terms [^a2e66b3b]. Pancreas (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

The 1992 Atlanta classification is a clinically based classification system that defines the severity and complications of acute pancreatitis. The purpose of this review was to assess whether the terms abandoned by the Atlanta classification are really discarded in the literature. The second objective was to review what new terms have appeared in the literature since the Atlanta symposium.

Methods

We followed a Medline search strategy in review and guideline articles after the publication of the Atlanta classification. This search included the abandoned terms: "phlegmon", "infected pseudocyst", "hemorrhagic pancreatitis", and "persistent pancreatitis".

Results

A total of 239 publications were reviewed, including 10 guideline articles and 42 reviews. The abandoned terms "hemorrhagic pancreatitis" and "persistent pancreatitis" are hardly encountered, in contrast, both "infected pseudocyst" and "phlegmon" are frequently used, and several authors question their abandonment. New terminology in acute pancreatitis consists of "organized pancreatic necrosis", "necroma", "extrapancreatic necrosis", and "central gland necrosis".

Conclusions

This review demonstrates that the Atlanta classification is still not universally accepted. Several abandoned terms are frequently used, and new terms have emerged that describe manifestations in acute pancreatitis that were not specifically addressed during the Atlanta symposium.

### Federated learning for early severity prediction in acute pancreatitis: a multi-center study [^9ce547b2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common gastrointestinal disease that can easily lead to severe systemic complications. Its clinical manifestations mainly include abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Clinical diagnosis relies on serum amylase, lipase, and abdominal CT. As of 2019, the global incidence rate of AP was 3.48 per 10,000. According to the Atlanta classification, AP can be divided into mild acute pancreatitis (MAP), moderately severe acute pancreatitis (MSAP), and severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). This classification depends on the extent of local damage within and around the pancreas and systemic damage to distant organs. MAP is characterized by pancreatic hyperemia and edema at the tissue level. The course of the disease is often self - limiting, and it accounts for the majority of AP patients, generally with a good prognosis. Approximately 20% of patients will develop into moderately severe or severe cases, with a significantly higher incidence of local and systemic complications and mortality rates. At the same time, the condition of patients with AP often progresses rapidly, making early misdiagnosis common. Therefore, early, accurate, and timely assessment is crucial for AP patients, which is the key to reducing mortality.

Previous studies have confirmed that certain serological indicators are of significance in evaluating the severity of AP, but there are still some limitations. For example, although there is a correlation between hematocrit (HCT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and the severity of AP, their accuracy in independently diagnosing SAP is poor. C - reactive protein (CRP) is an acute - phase reaction indicator under the condition of inflammation and/or infection in the body, which is simple and easy to measure. However, a continuous increase or a value greater than 150 mg/L after 72 h of onset is required to achieve high accuracy in diagnosing pancreatic necrosis Currently, the commonly used scoring systems in clinical practice include Ranson score, CT severity index (CTSI) score, bedside index for severity in acute pancreatitis (BISAP) score, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score. One or more of these prediction methods can be combined to plan the initial care and intervention levels required for patient management during the disease process. However, the limitation lies in the large number of involved items, resulting in poor clinical operability Therefore, we hope to construct a simpler, more accurate, specific, and efficient model to predict the severity of AP at an early stage, providing a basis for formulating reasonable clinical plans.

### Concordance of the balthazar grade and the revised Atlanta classification: proposing a modified balthazar grade to predict the severity of acute pancreatitis in pediatric population [^2b716b1a]. Pancreas (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to compare the concordance of the Balthazar grade and the revised Atlanta classification and then establish a modified radiological scoring system that would predict 3 degrees of severity of acute pancreatitis (AP) based on the latest Atlanta classification.

Methods

A retrospective study enrolling pediatric inpatients with AP who had completed computed tomography was conducted between January 2006 and March 2018. The concordance of the 2 radiological scoring systems was assessed with κ statistic.

Results

The Balthazar grade was unable to accurately predict the severity of AP compared with the revised Atlanta classification. However, a modified Balthazar grading system defining patents with Balthazar grades A to C as mild, grade D as moderately, and grade E as severe presented perfect agreement with the revised Atlanta classification across the enrolled population (κ, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.73–0.97). The concordance of the modified Balthazar score and the revised Atlanta classification remained a perfect degree of agreement across repeated tests in 90 random samples (κ, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–0.85).

Conclusions

The modified Balthazar grade demonstrated perfect agreement with the latest Atlanta classification for AP severity scoring. As such, the modified Balthazar grade can be used to predict 3 degrees of severity of AP.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^9b4deae2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Although most patients with acute pancreatitis have the mild form of the disease, about 20–30% develops a severe form, often associated with single or multiple organ dysfunction requiring intensive care. Identifying the severe form early is one of the major challenges in managing severe acute pancreatitis. Infection of the pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis occurs in about 20–40% of patients with severe acute pancreatitis, and is associated with worsening organ dysfunctions. While most patients with sterile necrosis can be managed nonoperatively, patients with infected necrosis usually require an intervention that can be percutaneous, endoscopic, or open surgical. These guidelines present evidence-based international consensus statements on the management of severe acute pancreatitis from collaboration of a panel of experts meeting during the World Congress of Emergency Surgery in June 27–30, 2018 in Bertinoro, Italy. The main topics of these guidelines fall under the following topics: Diagnosis, Antibiotic treatment, Management in the Intensive Care Unit, Surgical and operative management, and Open abdomen.

### New prognostic markers for outcome of acute pancreatitis: overview of reporting in 184 studies [^4a20457a]. Pancreas (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to assess the reporting of studies on new prognostic markers of outcome in acute pancreatitis.

Methods

We used MEDLINE searches complemented with perusal of review articles' references to identify eligible English-language studies. We included studies evaluating nonroutine markers for acute pancreatitis. Eligible outcomes included Atlanta criteria, Japanese criteria for severity, multiple/single organ failure, complications, interventional treatment, hospitalization length, and death. We generated a 47-item checklist on Acute Pancreatitis Prognosis by adapting a previously constructed reporting guidance instrument for prognostic tumor markers (REMARK [Reporting Recommendations for Tumor Marker Prognostic Studies]). The checklist addresses the reporting of essential information in prognostic studies.

Results

The 184 identified eligible studies reported on 196 different prognostic markers. One hundred forty-four studies (78.3%) found at least 1 prognostic marker to be nominally statistically significant. Significant improvements over time were seen in the reporting for 17 items, but major deficiencies were noted even in 2004–2009 studies. Particularly, 12 items were reported in less than 10% of studies overall and even within the most recent studies.

Conclusions

Despite some improvements over time, the reporting of important aspects of prognostic studies in acute pancreatitis remains suboptimal. The proposed REMARK-based checklist may help improve the quality and reporting of research in this field.

### The modified pancreatitis activity scoring system shows distinct trajectories in acute pancreatitis: an international study [^a0ae9d00]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

The aims of this study were to: (1) assess the performance of the Pancreatitis Activity Scoring System (PASS) in a large intercontinental cohort of patients with acute pancreatitis (AP); and (2) investigate whether a modified PASS (mPASS) yields a similar predictive accuracy and produces distinct early trajectories between severity subgroups.

Methods

Data was prospectively collected through the Acute Pancreatitis Patient Registry to Examine Novel Therapies In Clinical Experience (APPRENTICE) consortium (2015–2018) involving 22 centers from 4 continents. AP severity was categorized per the revised Atlanta classification. PASS trajectories were compared between the three severity groups using the generalized estimating equations model. Four mPASS models were generated by modifying the morphine equivalent dose (MED), and their trajectories were compared.

Results

A total of 1393 subjects were enrolled (median age, 49 years; 51% males). The study cohort included 950 mild (68.2%), 315 (22.6%) moderately severe, and 128 (9.2%) severe AP. Mild cases had the lowest PASS at each study time point (all P < .001). A subset of patients with outlier admission PASS values was identified. In the outlier group, 70% of the PASS variation was attributed to the MED, and 66% of these patients were from the United States centers. Among the 4 modified models, the mPASS-1 (excluding MED from PASS) demonstrated high performance in predicting severe AP with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 (vs area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.83 in conventional PASS) and produced distinct trajectories with distinct slopes between severity subgroups (all P < .001).

Conclusion

We propose a modified model by removing the MED component, which is easier to calculate, predicts accurately severe AP, and maintains significantly distinct early trajectories.

### A systematic review of the predictive factors for the recurrence of acute pancreatitis [^0dd934dc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is defined as an acute inflammatory process of the pancreas, with variable involvement of other regional tissues or remote organ systems. It can be considered the most common pancreatic disease with an incidence of 34 cases per 100.000 individuals worldwide with an amount of 2.8 million new cases per year. Higher occurrences are found in nations such as Japan, USA or Taiwan. Recent studies report an incidence of 40 cases per 100,000 in Europe, with an overall increasing trend.

AP can reach a mortality rate of 2% in Western countries, and up to 7.5% in Asia.

According to the Revised Atlanta Classification (RAC), a diagnosis of AP can be made by recognizing at least two of the following three characteristics: abdominal pain compatible with AP; serum lipase activity at least three times greater than the upper limit of the norm; characteristic findings of AP on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or transabdominal ultrasonography (US).

The etiology of AP is most commonly alcoholic (AAP) or biliary (BAP), with a different distribution that can based on the geographical region or age group of the affected population.

According to the RAC, AP can be classified into three categories by disease severity: mild AP, defined by the lack of organ failure and with typically short, self-resolving course; moderately severe AP, defined by transient organ failure (present for less than 48 h) and/or local complications; severe AP, defined by persistent organ failure (present for more than 48 h) often with local and systemic complications.

For many years, RAP (recurrent AP) has been defined as "two or more separate attacks of AP officially diagnosed and with complete resolution, occurring at a distance of at least 3 months from each other". However, in recent years RAP was identified with a clearer definition where it is described as "a syndrome of multiple distinct acute inflammatory responses originating within the pancreas in individuals with genetic, environmental, traumatic, morphologic, metabolic, biologic, and/or other risk factors who experienced 2 or more episodes of documented AP, separated by at least 3 months".

### Worldwide variations in demographics, management, and outcomes of acute pancreatitis [^ca2ba7a9]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Few studies have compared regional differences in acute pancreatitis. We analyzed data from an international registry of patients with acute pancreatitis to evaluate geographic variations in patient characteristics, management, and outcomes.

Methods

We collected data from the APPRENTICE registry of patients with acute pancreatitis, which obtains information from patients in Europe (6 centers), India (3 centers), Latin America (5 centers), and North America (8 centers) using standardized questionnaires. Our final analysis included 1612 patients with acute pancreatitis (median age, 49 years; 53% male, 62% white) enrolled from August 2015 through January 2018.

Results

Biliary (45%) and alcoholic acute pancreatitis (21%) were the most common etiologies. Based on the revised Atlanta classification, 65% of patients developed mild disease, 23% moderate, and 12% severe. The mean age of patients in Europe (58 years) was older than mean age for all 4 regions (46 years) and a higher proportion of patients in Europe had comorbid conditions (73% vs 50% overall). The predominant etiology of acute pancreatitis in Latin America was biliary (78%), whereas alcohol-associated pancreatitis accounted for the highest proportion of acute pancreatitis cases in India (45%). Pain was managed with opioid analgesics in 93% of patients in North America versus 27% of patients in the other 3 regions. Cholecystectomies were performed at the time of hospital admission for most patients in Latin America (60% vs 15% overall). A higher proportion of European patients with severe acute pancreatitis died during the original hospital stay (44%) compared with the other 3 regions (15%).

Conclusions

We found significant variation in demographics, etiologies, management practices, and outcomes of acute pancreatitis worldwide. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT03075618.

### Consensus guidelines on severe acute pancreatitis [^6523582f]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2015). Low credibility.

This Position Paper contains clinically oriented guidelines by the Italian Association for the Study of the Pancreas (AISP) for the diagnosis and treatment of severe acute pancreatitis. The statements were formulated by three working groups of experts who searched and analysed the most recent literature; a consensus process was then performed using a modified Delphi procedure. The statements provide recommendations on the most appropriate definition of the complications of severe acute pancreatitis, the diagnostic approach and the timing of conservative as well as interventional endoscopic, radiological and surgical treatments.

### The Atlanta classification, revised Atlanta classification, and determinant-based classification of acute pancreatitis: which is best at stratifying outcomes? [^d580cd21]. Pancreas (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine which classification is more accurate in stratifying severity.

Methods

The study used a retrospective analysis of a prospective acute pancreatitis database (June 2005-December 2007). Acute pancreatitis severity was stratified according to the Atlanta classification (AC) 1992, the revised Atlanta classification (RAC) 2012, and the determinant-based classification (DBC) 2012. Receiver operating characteristic analysis (area under the curve) compared the accuracy of each classification. Logistic regression identified predictors of mortality.

Results

338 patients were analyzed: 13% had persistent organ failure (POF) (> 48 hours), of whom 37% had multisystem POF, and 11% had pancreatic necrosis, of whom 19% had infected necrosis. Mortality was 4.1%. For predicting mortality (area under the curve), the RAC (0.91) and DBC (0.92) were comparable (P = 0.404); both outperformed the AC (0.81) (P < 0.001). For intensive care unit admission, the RAC (0.85) and DBC (0.85) were comparable (P = 0.949); both outperformed the AC (0.79) (P < 0.05). There were 2 patients in the critical category of the DBC. Multisystem POF was an independent predictor of mortality (odds ratio, 75.0; 95% confidence interval, 13.7–410.6; P < 0.001), whereas single-system POF, sterile necrosis, and infected necrosis were not.

Conclusion

The RAC and DBC were generally comparable in stratifying severity. The paucity of patients in the critical category in the DBC limits its utility. Neither classification accounts for the impact of multisystem POF, which was the strongest predictor of mortality.

### Timing of CHolecystectomy in severe PAncreatitis (CHISPA): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^097d9c27]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2024). High credibility.

Background

Acute pancreatitis is an important cause of morbidity with growing incidence rates. Pancreatitis severity is classified according to Atlanta's revised criteria into mild, moderately severe, or severe. The etiology for acute pancreatitis is mostly of biliary origin and as a result performing cholecystectomy is part of the treatment to avoid recurrent episodes.

In mild acute pancreatitis, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is recommended during the same hospital admission (also referred to as early cholecystectomy) due to evidence that reports it as a safe procedure associated with a reduction in complications relating to biliary disease. Modern guidelines for the management of mild acute pancreatitis recommend early cholecystectomy with a Grade 1A recommendation.

However, in the approximately 20% of cases classified as moderately severe and severe acute pancreatitis there is not a clear current recommendation on timing of cholecystectomy. The WSES guidelines (World Journal of Emergency Surgery) recommend delayed cholecystectomy on patients diagnosed with pancreatitis with peripancreatic collections until they are resolved or when the patient is clinically and hemodynamically stable and inflammation subsides, with a Grade 2C recommendation (very weak recommendation; other alternatives may be equally reasonable). This recommendation was included based on a study that compared early versus delayed cholecystectomy on patients with moderately severe or severe pancreatitis and peripancreatic collections, finding a higher rate of complications in the early cholecystectomy group. A recently published retrospective study on which surgical outcomes for laparoscopic cholecystectomy after pancreatitis were compared evidenced that performing cholecystectomy is a safe procedure regardless of the severity of pancreatitis.

There is not any current evidence that dictates clear recommendations on an ideal timing for performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients diagnosed with severe pancreatitis. The aim of this study is to establish whether there is a difference in surgical outcomes between patients diagnosed with severe pancreatitis on which cholecystectomy was performed during the same hospital admission versus patients on which interval cholecystectomy was performed (4 weeks after recovery of pancreatitis).

### Acute abdominal pain in a 15-year-old male patient [^52d93a3d]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Final Diagnosis

The patient presented with 2 of the 3 criteria from the revised Atlanta classification, including acute onset epigastric pain and elevated lipase, which led to a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) without a clear etiology. Given that the patient was previously well, the negative workup for common causes of AP, and the progressive history of cannabis use coinciding with the onset of symptoms, the likely cause for the patient's symptoms was ingestion of cannabis. He was diagnosed with cannabis-induced acute pancreatitis (CIAP) with secondary upper gastrointestinal bleed resulting from a Mallory-Weiss tear.

### Artificial intelligence prediction for the severity of acute pancreatitis… [^596ae25e]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Artificial Intelligence Prediction for the Severity of Acute PancreatitisClinicalTrials. gov ID
- Accurately estimation of the severity of the disease by machine learning method
- Severity is described as mild, moderate, and severe acute pancreatitis according to the revised Atlanta criteria.
- Invasive procedure requirement
- Need for EUS or ERCP during hospital stay for evaluation of the reasons such as distal choledochal obstruction by stone, pseudocyst or necrosis developments. The incidence of acute pancreatitis is increasing nowadays. The diagnosis of AP is defined according to Atlanta criteria with the presence of two of the following 3 findings; a) characteristic abdominal pain b) amylase and lipase values ≥ 3 times c) AP diagnosis in ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, or computerized tomography imaging.

Scoring systems with clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings are used to evaluate the severity of the disease. Advanced age, obesity, cigarette and alcohol usage, blood urea nitrogen ≥ 20 mg/dl, increased creatinine, C reactive protein level > 120mg/dl, decreased or increased Hct levels, ≥ 8 Balthazar score on abdominal CT implies serious AP.

### Surgical intervention strategies of necrotizing pancreatitis with abdominal compartment syndrome [^576cfa20]. Pancreas (2022). Medium credibility.

The Atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis (AP) was proposed in 1992 and has been widely adopted. Through this classification, clinicians are allowed to have a unified standard for clinical research and communication. Because of the increased awareness of the pathophysiology and prognosis of necrotizing pancreatitis (NP) as well as the advancement of diagnostic imaging, corrections of the Atlanta classification have been made to further accurately assess the severity and objectively describe the manifestations of local pancreatic complications. The revised Atlanta classification of AP was pronounced on August 29, 2012. Accordingly, AP can be classified into 3 categories by disease severity: mild, moderate, and severe (Fig. 1). Generally, it is a medical disease and patients can usually recover after conservative treatment. If it proceeds into severe AP, there may be some peripancreatic fluid collection and necrosis development. Severe AP is commonly defined by progression of pancreatic symptoms/signs and accompanied by organ failure lasting more than 48 hours, which needs intensive care for organ support. When more than 30% of the pancreas is affected by necrosis, we call it NP, which accounts for 5% to 10% of severe AP cases and is associated with a mortality rate as high as 25% in the intensive care unit (ICU).

### Acute pancreatitis [^6863b2ea]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute pancreatitis:

- **Definition**: Acute pancreatitis is a disease characterized by acute inflammation of the pancreas.
- **Pathophysiology**: Acute pancreatitis is most frequently due to gallstones (40%) and alcohol (30%). Other minor causes include ERCP (5–10%), surgical complications (5–10%), drugs (< 5%), hypertriglyceridemia (2–5%), trauma (< 1%), infection (< 1%) and autoimmunity (< 1%).
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of acute pancreatitis ranges from 13 to 45 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: In patients with acute pancreatitis, localized tissue damage causes activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to a systemic inflammatory response that can progress to multiple organ failure and early mortality. The compensatory release of anti-inflammatory mediators plays a role in causing increased susceptibility to septic complications, such as infected pancreatic necrosis, and contributes to late mortality.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Mortality associated with acute pancreatitis is approximately 1–5%, and the recurrence rate is approximately 20%.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition and the society for pediatric radiology joint position paper on noninvasive imaging of pediatric pancreatitis: literature summary and recommendations [^4fffb8c9]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). High credibility.

Imaging findings of acute pancreatitis — patterns and modality nuances: Two forms of acute pancreatitis (AP) are distinguishable by imaging: interstitial edematous and necrotizing pancreatitis, with the former more common. In the very early stages of AP, ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) may show no abnormal findings, whereas this does not seem to apply to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which has higher soft tissue contrast resolution. In necrotizing pancreatitis, findings depend on the stage: early there is decreased or absent vascularity/perfusion of the gland with hypoenhancement following contrast administration; as necrosis evolves, the gland and peripancreatic tissues may be replaced by necrotic collections that by ultrasound and MRI will contain debris, may deceptively appear simpler by CT, and superinfection may present with air in the collection(s). Fluid collections associated with AP have specific definitions updated in the 2012 Revised Atlanta Classification.

### Performance of the revised Atlanta and determinant-based classifications for severity in acute pancreatitis [^962e1937]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Severity classification systems aim to stratify patients with acute pancreatitis reliably into coherent risk groups. Recently, the Atlanta 1992 classification has been revised (Atlanta 2012) and a novel determinant-based classification (DBC) system developed. This study assessed the ability of the three systems to stratify disease severity among patients with acute pancreatitis.

Methods

This was an observational cohort study of patients with acute pancreatitis identified from an institutional database. Cohort characteristics, investigations, interventions and outcomes were identified. Systems were compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and Spearman's correlation coefficients.

Results

The in-hospital mortality rate was 6.6 per cent (15 of 228 patients). All of the outcomes considered correlated significantly with the three systems, with the exception of the need for surgery in Atlanta 1992. Atlanta 2012 and the DBC had higher area under the curve (AUC) values than Atlanta 1992 for all outcomes. The revised Atlanta and DBC systems both performed similarly with regard to ICU admission (AUC 0.927 and 0.917 respectively; both P < 0.001), need for percutaneous drainage (AUC 0.879 and 0.891; both P < 0.001), need for surgery (AUC 0.827 and 0.845; P = 0.006 and P = 0.004 respectively) and in-hospital mortality (0.955 and 0.931; both P < 0.001). However, the critical category in the DBC system identified patients with the most severe disease; seven of eight patients in this group died in hospital, compared with 15 of 34 with severe pancreatitis according to Atlanta 2012.

Conclusion

The Atlanta 2012 and DBC perform equally well for classification of disease severity in acute pancreatitis. The addition of a critical category in the DBC identifies patients with the most severe disease.

### Prospective validation of 4-category classification of acute pancreatitis severity [^320a083f]. Pancreas (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Atlanta classification divides patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) into mild and severe disease. A 4-category severity classification has been proposed based on the presence or absence of local and systemic determinants, giving rise to mild, moderate, severe, or critical AP. The aim of this study was to validate this new 4-category system of severity classification by examining markers of severity and outcome.

Methods

Data from 151 consecutive patients with AP from January 2009 to December 2010 [mean age (SD), 41.1 (3.5) years; 101 men] were collected. Management was standardized. Patients were classified as mild [no necrosis or organ failure (OF)], moderate (sterile necrosis or transient OF), severe [infected necrosis (IN) or persistent OF], or critical (IN and persistent OF) AP. Data were compared between groups for severity and outcome.

Results

There were 21 (13.9%) patients with mild, 63 (41.7%) moderate, 59 (39.1%) severe, and 8 (5.3%) critical AP. There was a significant difference between these categories for length of hospital stay, computed tomographic severity index scores, occurrence of bloodstream infections, incidence of IN, requirements for percutaneous catheter drain, numbers of operations, and mortality.

Conclusions

This prospective case series clinically validated the 4-category classification of AP severity.

### Identification of robust associations between admission microbiome profiles and complications of acute pancreatitis [^e642d276]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Study design, population and clinical data collection

The POEMA (Prospective Multicenter Microbiota Study for Monitoring and Evaluation of Severe Acute Pancreatitis) Study was a prospective, observational multicentre cohort study (NL-OMON29684) conducted in 20 Dutch hospitals. The present manuscript presents the main, prespecified analysis of the POEMA Study. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient or the patient's legal representative. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Between October 2019 and January 2022, all consecutive patients that were hospitalised with a first episode of acute pancreatitis were eligible for inclusion. Acute pancreatitis was diagnosed according to the revised Atlanta Criteria. Exclusion criteria were: an age younger than 18 years, pregnancy, disease onset more than 72 hours, a history of (recurrent) acute or chronic pancreatitis (according to the M-ANNHEIM criteria) and antibiotic use within the last 2 months. Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records and a patient questionnaire, and entered into an Electronic Data Capture database (Castor EDC). The questionnaire, collected at inclusion, included self-reported medical and lifestyle information, such as alcohol use, smoking, antibiotic treatment within 6 months prior to admission and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use (see online supplemental Methods). The follow-up of clinical data was at least 90 days following the initial admission. The revised Atlanta classification was used for severity stratification. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist and all definitions used are provided in the online supplemental methods.

### Comparison between revised Atlanta classification and determinant-based classification for acute pancreatitis in intensive care medicine. why Do not use a modified determinant-based classification? [^ad92af2c]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the classification performance of the Revised Atlanta Classification, the Determinant-Based Classification, and a new modified Determinant-Based Classification according to observed mortality and morbidity.

Design

A prospective multicenter observational study conducted in 1-year period.

Setting

Forty-six international ICUs (Epidemiology of Acute Pancreatitis in Intensive Care Medicine study).

Patients

Admitted to an ICU with acute pancreatitis and at least one organ failure.

Interventions

Modified Determinant-Based Classification included four categories: In group 1, patients with transient organ failure and without local complications; in group 2, patients with transient organ failure and local complications; in group 3, patients with persistent organ failure and without local complications; and in group 4, patients with persistent organ failure and local complications.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 374 patients were included (mortality rate of 28.9%). When modified Determinant-Based Classification was applied, patients in group 1 presented low mortality (2.26%) and morbidity (5.38%), patients in group 2 presented low mortality (6.67%) and high morbidity (60.71%), patients in group 3 presented high mortality (41.46%) and low morbidity (8.33%), and patients in group 4 presented high mortality (59.09%) and morbidity (88.89%). The area under the receiver operator characteristics curve of modified Determinant-Based Classification for mortality was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77–0.85), with significant differences in comparison to Revised Atlanta Classification (0.77; 95% CI, 0.73–0.81; p < 0.01), and Determinant-Based Classification (0.77; 95% CI, 0.72–0.81; p < 0.01). For morbidity, the area under the curve of modified Determinant-Based Classification was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.73–0.86), with significant differences in comparison to Revised Atlanta Classification (0.63, 95% CI, 0.57–0.70; p < 0.01), but not in comparison to Determinant-Based Classification (0.81, 95% CI, 0.74–0.88; nonsignificant).

Conclusion

Modified Determinant-Based Classification identified four groups with different clinical presentation in patients with acute pancreatitis in ICU, with better discriminatory power in comparison to Determinant-Based Classification and Revised Atlanta Classification.
