## Question

Is a hemoglobin of 10.4 too low for surgery?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL is too low for surgery and what to do about it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how this hemoglobin maps to anemia definitions and severity. Then, I should verify guideline thresholds for screening and optimization before elective surgery. Next, I will examine data on perioperative risks at this hemoglobin level. After that, I need to consider surgical urgency and bleeding risk. I will then review patient-specific modifiers and optimization strategies, including iron and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Finally, I should confirm transfusion thresholds and synthesize a clear recommendation for elective versus urgent surgery scenarios.

> Let me first confirm the classification: 10.4 g/dL equals 104 g/L, and by commonly used WHO criteria adopted in perioperative guidance, anemia is Hb < 13.0 g/dL in men and < 12.0 g/dL in nonpregnant women, with 8–10.9 g/dL typically considered moderate anemia for adults, so 10.4 g/dL sits in the moderate range regardless of sex, which already signals elevated perioperative risk that should not be ignored [^114m5jSj].

> Next, I should review guideline-based thresholds for preoperative screening and optimization; the British Society for Haematology (2024) recommends treating Hb < 130 g/L as the level at which patients are likely to benefit from systematic evaluation for iron and other nutritional deficiencies and patient blood management measures before major surgery, the Association of Anaesthetists (2025) recommends obtaining preoperative hemoglobin for all patients before major elective surgery, and the ESC 2022 guidelines explicitly recommend detecting and treating anemia in advance of non-cardiac surgery to reduce transfusion and adverse events [^111Na2Zi] [^1171AMNv] [^115F5YRX].

> Hold on, I should verify timing and targets; NATA guidance recommends checking hemoglobin about 28 days preoperatively to allow time for diagnosis and treatment, and suggests targeting a preoperative hemoglobin within the normal WHO range rather than accepting values in the 10–11 g/dL band, which reinforces that 10.4 g/dL is well below optimization targets for elective cases [^114m5jSj].

> I will now examine risk at this hemoglobin level; observational data across procedures show dose–response increases in major complications as preoperative hemoglobin drops, for example in lumbar fusion, women with Hb < 10.9 g/dL had a 3.4-fold higher 90-day major complication risk and higher sepsis, AKI, and PE rates, and in a large mixed-surgery cohort of women, Hb < 12.0 g/dL was associated with markedly higher transfusion and infectious complications compared with Hb ≥ 13.0 g/dL, which aligns with the risk signal at 10.4 g/dL [^114ncwZw] [^1169p9uM].

> Let me consider cardiac and mortality risk; in elderly hip fracture cohorts, preoperative Hb < 10 g/dL independently predicted higher major adverse cardiac events and longer hospital stays, and in cardiac surgery populations, preoperative anemia, especially below ~10 g/dL, has been repeatedly linked to 2–5× higher mortality and morbidity even after adjustment, indicating that 10.4 g/dL sits near a threshold where cardiopulmonary reserve becomes clinically consequential in higher-risk patients [^114GFwrU] [^1113mpe4] [^115G5SUG] [^112KHCko].

> But wait, surgical context matters; for elective, moderate-to-major blood loss procedures, guidelines favor deferring to optimize hemoglobin and treat the cause of anemia, whereas in urgent or emergency surgery, proceeding with enhanced PBM, tranexamic acid, cell salvage, and restrictive transfusion thresholds is appropriate, and here I should double-check a potential confusion: BSH notes consideration of referral for unexplained anemia severity bands of Hb < 120 g/L in males and < 100 g/L in females, which at first glance seems inverted relative to WHO anemia definitions, but this is a referral severity criterion rather than the diagnostic threshold, so it does not change the conclusion that 10.4 g/dL warrants investigation and optimization before elective surgery [^114m5jSj] [^115Gjpto] [^115B3gQo].

> I need to check bleeding risk implications; in high blood-loss operations such as major orthopedic, cardiac, or colorectal surgery, preoperative anemia substantially increases transfusion and complication rates, with orthopedic literature showing allogeneic transfusion rates frequently exceeding 25–60% when anemia is present, and intraoperative surveys highlight that many patients who get transfused start surgery already anemic, suggesting a missed optimization opportunity at the preadmission stage [^1121eGRE] [^115wCz24].

> Let me think about patient-specific modifiers; older age, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and inflammatory states magnify the physiologic impact of a hemoglobin around 10 g/dL, increasing risks of myocardial ischemia, AKI, infection, and prolonged recovery, so this hemoglobin level should trigger a more conservative plan in such patients, consistent with ESC recommendations for comprehensive risk stratification and with consensus statements identifying low preoperative hemoglobin as a key driver of postoperative anemia and transfusion needs [^115F5YRX] [^111Egb6N].

> Next, I should review how to optimize; initial work-up should confirm the etiology with CBC indices and iron studies, reflex anemia panels can streamline diagnosing iron deficiency, and if surgery is within 2–4 weeks or oral iron is not tolerated, intravenous iron is preferred per BSH and PBM principles, with the aim of moving hemoglobin into the normal range before elective procedures whenever feasible [^117JS1c1] [^115UUWx6] [^114zFjPX] [^115qzz8p].

> Hold on, let me verify the evidence base for IV iron; while pragmatic studies in colorectal cancer have not always demonstrated reduced transfusion rates and have shown heterogeneous effects on preoperative hemoglobin, broader perioperative PBM frameworks still support IV iron as part of multimodal optimization, and modern safety data with newer formulations show a low rate of serious hypersensitivity when administered in an appropriate setting, which supports using IV iron when indicated despite mixed efficacy signals on hard outcomes in some cohorts [^112yDr3D] [^1158A4VU] [^112KHCko] [^112fptXx].

> I should confirm the role of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents; a Cochrane review indicates that rHuEPO plus iron can raise preoperative hemoglobin and reduce allogeneic transfusion exposure in anemic adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery, so ESAs are reasonable in select patients when iron repletion alone is insufficient or time-constrained, balancing thrombotic risk and indication-specific considerations [^117PBVBw].

> Let me double-check transfusion thresholds; modern randomized trials and meta-analyses support restrictive transfusion strategies in the 7–8 g/dL range for most stable perioperative adults, with condition-specific exceptions, and in hip fracture care a threshold around 8 g/dL is endorsed for asymptomatic postoperative patients, so 10.4 g/dL is above typical transfusion triggers and should not prompt transfusion by default, yet it clearly flags preoperative anemia that carries independent risk and warrants correction before elective surgery [^116AitPg] [^112H74YU] [^116VDxpq] [^116JJmiX].

> Synthesizing this, I need to ensure the recommendation is explicit: at 10.4 g/dL, this is moderate anemia and is too low for elective moderate-to-major surgery; the appropriate course is to diagnose and treat the cause, preferentially with IV iron when iron deficiency is present and time is short, consider ESAs in select cases, and delay elective procedures until hemoglobin is optimized toward ≥ 12 g/dL in women and ≥ 13 g/dL in men per WHO-aligned targets, whereas in urgent or emergency settings you may proceed with enhanced PBM and restrictive transfusion thresholds while aggressively managing iron deficiency and comorbid risk [^114iYEvD] [^111Na2Zi] [^115F5YRX].

No — hemoglobin 10.4 g/dL is **not too low to proceed with surgery**; however, it is below the normal range and associated with **increased perioperative risk** [^115JrzUh]. The decision to proceed should be **individualized** based on the patient's comorbidities, expected blood loss, and procedural urgency [^115F5YRX]. For elective major surgery, guidelines recommend **identifying and treating anemia** when Hb is < 13 g/dL [^111jFZne], with IV iron preferred if iron deficiency is present. For urgent or high-risk cases, a **restrictive transfusion threshold of 7–8 g/dL** is generally safe [^112H74YU] [^116AitPg], but higher thresholds (8–10 g/dL) may be appropriate for patients with cardiovascular disease or anticipated significant blood loss. Preoperative anemia management should include identifying the cause [^111jFZne], correcting deficiencies [^112KHCko], and **optimizing hemoglobin** to reduce transfusion needs and complications [^111Na2Zi].

---

## Clinical significance of hemoglobin 10.4 g/dL

Hemoglobin 10.4 g/dL is below normal and indicates **mild anemia**, which is associated with increased perioperative risk [^115JrzUh], including higher transfusion rates [^115wCz24], longer hospital stays [^111kjogn], and increased morbidity and mortality. Clinical impact depends on **patient factors, surgical risk, and anticipated blood loss** [^115F5YRX].

---

## Guidelines and recommendations

### General surgical patients

For general surgical patients, a **screening threshold** of Hb < 13 g/dL should prompt evaluation for iron and nutrient deficiencies and patient blood management (PBM) measures [^111jFZne] [^1171AMNv]. A **restrictive transfusion threshold** (Hb 7–8 g/dL) is generally safe for stable patients without significant comorbidities [^112H74YU] [^116AitPg].

---

### Cardiac surgery patients

In cardiac surgery patients, preoperative anemia confers **higher risk** [^116sVFaz], with increased transfusion, kidney injury, stroke, infection, and mortality [^115G5SUG]. A **restrictive transfusion threshold** (Hb 7.5–8 g/dL) is generally safe [^116JJmiX], though higher thresholds (8–10 g/dL) may be used for significant cardiovascular disease or anticipated blood loss.

---

### Orthopedic surgery patients

Among orthopedic surgery patients, preoperative anemia is linked to **increased risk**, including higher rates of transfusion, infection, and complications [^1121eGRE] [^114m5jSj]. A **restrictive transfusion threshold** (Hb 7–8 g/dL) is generally safe, though higher thresholds (8–10 g/dL) may be used for significant comorbidities or anticipated blood loss.

---

## Risks associated with hemoglobin 10.4 g/dL

Preoperative anemia at this level is associated with:

- **Increased transfusion risk**: Higher likelihood of perioperative transfusion [^115wCz24] [^111jFZne].
- **Increased morbidity and mortality**: Higher rates of complications and mortality [^115JrzUh] [^111JdWeK].
- **Longer hospital stay**: Increased length of stay and healthcare costs [^111kjogn] [^111Na2Zi].

---

## Management strategies

### Preoperative optimization

- **Identify and treat anemia**: Determine the cause and correct deficiencies (iron, B12, folate) [^111Na2Zi] [^1171AMNv].
- **IV iron**: Preferred for iron deficiency anemia, especially when surgery is imminent [^111jFZne] [^115qzz8p].
- **Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents**: Consider for severe anemia or when rapid correction is needed [^117PBVBw] [^111jFZne].

---

### Intraoperative and postoperative management

Intraoperative and postoperative management should **minimize blood loss** by using cell salvage, antifibrinolytics, and meticulous hemostasis [^112KHCko]. A **restrictive transfusion** strategy with individualized assessment is recommended [^116AitPg] [^111jFZne].

---

## Patient-specific factors

The decision to proceed with surgery at **Hb 10.4 g/dL** should consider:

- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular disease, renal impairment, and other chronic conditions [^115F5YRX].
- **Surgical risk**: Expected blood loss and procedure complexity [^1171AMNv].
- **Urgency**: Elective vs. urgent or emergent surgery [^112KHCko].

---

## Summary table: hemoglobin thresholds and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended hemoglobin threshold** | **Management recommendations** |
|-|-|-|
| General surgery | < 13 g/dL | - Screen for anemia <br/> - Treat deficiencies <br/> - PBM measures |
| Cardiac surgery | - 7.5–8 g/dL (restrictive) <br/> - 8–10 g/dL (liberal) | Individualized transfusion strategy |
| Orthopedic surgery | - 7–8 g/dL (restrictive) <br/> - 8–10 g/dL (liberal) | Individualized transfusion strategy |

---

Hemoglobin 10.4 g/dL is below normal and increases perioperative risk but is **not an absolute contraindication to surgery** [^115JrzUh] [^115F5YRX]. Management should be **individualized**, with **preoperative optimization** and a **restrictive transfusion strategy** to reduce complications and improve outcomes [^116AitPg] [^112KHCko].

### Transfusion threshold of hemoglobin 80 g/L is comparable to 100 g/L in terms of bleeding in cardiac surgery: A prospective randomized study [^113ZzqHC]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is common after cardiac surgery and, according to some suggestive evidence, may be associated with increased bleeding, other morbidity, and mortality. However, transfusion of red blood cells (RBC) may cause adverse effects and increase cost. The authors hypothesized that the restrictive hemoglobin threshold (Hb of 80 g/L) may aggravate bleeding more than the higher Hb threshold (Hb 100 g/L).

The study was a prospective randomized trial conducted at the University Hospital of Helsinki, Finland. Eighty patients with written informed consent, scheduled for elective open-heart surgery, were randomized into two groups. Two study groups had RBC transfusion thresholds of either Hb 80 g/L or 100 g/L. These triggers were followed for a 24-hour period postoperatively, and medical follow-up was carried out for 7 days after surgery.

Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) and conventional laboratory tests were performed to evaluate coagulation. There was no significant difference in bleeding or ROTEM parameters between the groups. The complication rate and Hb concentration after the 7-day follow-up were not different between the groups. However, the group with a threshold of 100 g/L had received twice the amount of RBC transfusions.

In conclusion, the Hb threshold of 80 g/L for RBC transfusion in cardiac surgery is comparable to 100 g/L in terms of bleeding and possibly short-term complications.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^112H74YU]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Red blood cell transfusion: transfusion thresholds for whom and when? Allogeneic red cell transfusion is associated with a significant increase in peri‐operative morbidity and mortality. In addition, there is a worldwide shortage of blood, with substantial associated costs to the manufacturer and health systems. Moreover, red cell transfusion risks infectious, immunological, haemolytic, non‐haemolytic adverse reactions, cardiac and pulmonary complications. Despite successful implementation of PBM programmes, red cell transfusion is still widely used as a default treatment for the majority of patients with acute postoperative anaemia.

Historically, the standard for red cell transfusion was a liberal transfusion threshold, namely haemoglobin level < 100 g/l (or haematocrit < 30%). This arbitrary transfusion threshold has been gradually lowered towards haemoglobin 70–80 g/l, as derived from a number of RCTs evaluating the effect on patient outcomes of restrictive vs. more liberal red cell transfusion strategies in a variety of clinical settings. When subjected to pooled analysis in several systematic reviews and meta‐analyses, data from these RCTs show that, in terms of morbidity and mortality, a restrictive red cell transfusion strategy is equivalent to or more beneficial than a liberal strategy.

In addition, evidence‐based guidelines have translated the results of RCTs and meta‐analyses into clinical practice.

### Patient blood management for neonates and children undergoing cardiac surgery: 2019 NATA guidelines [^112x6z39]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2019). Low credibility.

Pediatric cardiac surgery is associated with a substantial risk of bleeding, frequently necessitating the administration of allogeneic blood products. Efforts to optimize preoperative hemoglobin, limit blood sampling, improve hemostasis, reduce bleeding, correct coagulopathy, and incorporate blood-sparing techniques (including restrictive transfusion practices) are key elements of patient blood management (PBM) programs. These practices should be applied to the pediatric cardiac surgical population as well as across other disciplines.

Many guidelines for the implementation of PBM in adults undergoing cardiac surgery are available; however, evidence regarding the implementation of PBM in children is limited to systematic reviews, and specific guidelines for the pediatric cardiac population are lacking. The objective of the task force from the Network for the Advancement of Patient Blood Management, Haemostasis and Thrombosis (NATA, www.nataonline.com) is to provide evidence-based recommendations regarding anemia management and blood transfusion practices in the perioperative care of neonates and children undergoing cardiac surgery. Additionally, the task force aims to highlight potential areas where further research is urgently required.

### The effect of varying preoperative hemoglobin levels on the risk of major complications and surgical site infections after single level lumbar fusion [^114ncwZw]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global research & reviews (2024). Low credibility.

The study analyzed varying preoperative hemoglobin levels to assess their impact on the risk of major complications and surgical site infections after single-level lumbar fusion. With respect to the highest hemoglobin stratum (12.5 to 17 g/dL), two female strata had a significantly increased risk of 90-day major complications: 11.0 to 12.4 g/dL [RR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.22–1.89; P < 0.001] and < 10.9 g/dL [RR, 3.40; 95% CI, 2.37–4.88; P < 0.001]. Furthermore, one female stratum had a significantly increased risk of 2-year surgical site infections for < 10.9 g/dL [RR, 3.67; 95% CI, 2.09–6.42; P < 0.001].

- **Analysis of major complications**: When the matched 90-day major complications were broken down into individual complications, the < 10.9-g/dL hemoglobin strata had an increased risk of sepsis [RR, 4.30; 95% CI, 2.18–8.49; P < 0.001], acute kidney injury [RR, 4.38; 95% CI, 2.57–7.45; P < 0.001], and pulmonary embolism [RR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.54–4.14; P < 0.001]. Meanwhile, the 11.0–12.4-g/dL hemoglobin strata showed an increased risk of both acute kidney injury [RR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.27–2.42; P < 0.001] and pulmonary embolism [RR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.10–3.15; P = 0.019].

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^114RZhk9]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

All patients who have undergone major surgery (defined as blood loss > 500 mL or lasting > 2 hours) and who had pre-operative anaemia or moderate-to-severe blood loss during surgery must be screened for anaemia after surgery. During recovery from uncomplicated major surgery, haemoglobin concentrations should be monitored, either by standard laboratory or point-of-care testing, on a regular daily basis. This monitoring should continue at least until the third postoperative day to detect anaemia (haemoglobin < 130 g.l −1 for men, < 120 g.l −1 for women).

Postoperatively, iron deficiency should be defined by ferritin concentration < 100 μg.l −1, ferritin < 100–300 μg.l −1 and transferrin saturation < 20%, or reticulocyte haemoglobin content < 28 pg. High blood loss during surgery may also indicate the need for iron replacement in anaemic patients. In the postoperative period, when the administration of iron is necessary, early intravenous (i.v.) iron therapy is recommended after considering contraindications. Where possible, it should be administered using a single high-dose preparation for the repletion of iron stores.

For non-cancer patients with severe postoperative anaemia and inflammation-induced blunted erythropoiesis, or for those declining blood transfusion, we suggest considering additional treatment with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent. If patient blood management measures did not prevent the development of severe postoperative anaemia, the adoption of a restrictive transfusion threshold (haemoglobin level: 70–80 g.l −1, depending on patient comorbidities) is recommended.

### Detection, evaluation, and management of preoperative anaemia in the elective orthopaedic surgical patient: NATA guidelines [^114m5jSj]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Previously undiagnosed anaemia is common in elective orthopaedic surgical patients and is associated with an increased likelihood of blood transfusion, as well as elevated perioperative morbidity and mortality. A standardized approach for the detection, evaluation, and management of anaemia in this context has been identified as an unmet medical need.

A multidisciplinary panel of physicians was convened by the Network for Advancement of Transfusion Alternatives (NATA) with the aim of developing practice guidelines for the detection, evaluation, and management of preoperative anaemia in elective orthopaedic surgery. A systematic literature review and critical evaluation of the evidence was performed, and recommendations were formulated according to the method proposed by the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group.

- **Detection and evaluation**: We recommend that elective orthopaedic surgical patients have a haemoglobin (Hb) level determination 28 days before the scheduled surgical procedure if possible (Grade 1C). Further laboratory testing to evaluate anaemia for nutritional deficiencies, chronic renal insufficiency, and/or chronic inflammatory disease is also recommended (Grade 1C).

- **Management**: We suggest that the patient's target Hb before elective surgery be within the normal range, according to the World Health Organization criteria (Grade 2C). Nutritional deficiencies should be treated (Grade 1C). We also suggest that erythropoiesis-stimulating agents be used for anaemic patients in whom nutritional deficiencies have been ruled out, corrected, or both (Grade 2A).

### Preoperative intravenous iron treatment in colorectal cancer: Experience from clinical practice [^112yDr3D]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2022). High credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality in abdominal surgery. In clinical trials, preoperative intravenous (i.v.) iron treatment increases the preoperative hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, but the effect on transfusion rates is not consistent. This study reports on the experience with preoperative i.v. iron treatment in surgical colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in clinical practice.

- **Methods**: A registry-based cohort study was conducted. Surgical colorectal cancer patients with iron deficiency anemia were divided into two groups: those who preoperatively received i.v. iron treatment and those who did not. Primary outcomes were preoperative changes in Hb and the difference in perioperative red blood cell transfusion (RBCT) rates. Postoperative complications and mortality rates were analyzed, and a descriptive analysis of what triggered blood transfusions was performed.

- **Results**: A total of 170 patients were included. Of these, 122 received preoperative i.v. iron treatment and 48 did not. The perioperative transfusion rate was 45% (55/122) in the treatment group and 40% (19/48) in the control group (non-significant difference). The preoperative changes in Hb levels were not different between the two groups. Transfusion practice appeared more liberal and was preceded by higher Hb levels, guided by the national transfusion guideline. I.v. iron-treated patients had a higher rate of postoperative complications. No differences were found in length of stay (LOS) or postoperative mortality.

- **Conclusions**: Preoperative i.v. iron treatment did not significantly influence transfusion rates or improve preoperative Hb levels. However, patients who received i.v. iron treatment experienced higher rates of postoperative complications without differences in LOS or mortality.

### Identification and management of preoperative anaemia in adults: A British Society for Haematology guideline update [^115Gjpto]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). High credibility.

In regards to preventative measures for red blood cell transfusion, particularly in the context of correcting preoperative anemia, the BSH 2024 guidelines recommend considering the referral of patients with unexplained anemia without iron deficiency. This should be done according to the severity of anemia, defined as hemoglobin levels less than 120 g/L for males and less than 100 g/L for females, or other locally agreed criteria. It is important to recognize that the risk of a serious underlying cause or haemoglobinopathy is proportional to the severity of the anemia.

### Preoperative anemia treatment with intravenous iron in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery: A systematic review [^1121eGRE]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). Low credibility.

Preoperative anemia is common among patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery and can affect up to 20% of patients. Based on the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, iron deficiency anemia (IDA) causes at least 20% of anemia cases in adults over the age of 65. Thus, optimizing patients' iron stores preoperatively could resolve many anemia cases.

Preoperative anemia is associated with increased blood transfusions, health care costs, morbidity, and mortality. This is particularly important in major orthopedic surgery due to the potential for substantial perioperative blood loss, leading to high rates of allogeneic blood transfusion (ABT) in total hip replacements (25%-60%), total knee replacements (25%-50%), and hip fracture repairs (30%-70%).

- **Association with complications**: Blood transfusions have been associated with increased infection rates, longer hospital stays, and higher mortality. One study demonstrated a dose-dependent correlation between units of blood given intraoperatively and the incidence of complications after major surgery.

- **Potential for improvement**: It is expected that ABT and the incidence of side effects could be reduced through the perioperative correction of IDA.

Iron deficiency anemia can be treated with either oral or intravenous (IV) iron replenishment. Oral iron is inexpensive, but patient compliance is often poor due to gastrointestinal side effects, and intestinal absorption may be limited. Intravenous iron raises hemoglobin (Hb) faster than oral iron, is more cost-effective, and is well tolerated.

### Preoperative hemoglobin < 10 g/dL predicts an increase in major adverse cardiac events in patients with hip fracture over 80 years: A retrospective cohort study [^114GFwrU]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2023). High credibility.

The study investigated the relationship between preoperative hemoglobin levels and major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) in patients over 80 years of age undergoing hip fracture surgery. During hospitalization after surgery, sixty-seven MACEs and twenty-six deaths were identified. After adjusting for potential confounders, including age, sex, ASA classification, diagnosis, anesthesia methods, surgery types, and comorbidities, the analysis demonstrated that a preoperative hemoglobin level greater than 10 g/dL was associated with a decreased occurrence of complications.

Univariable logistic analysis revealed that the rate of MACEs in patients with lower hemoglobin levels had an odds ratio (OR) of 2.049 [95% CI (1.56, 2.69), P < 0.001]. Furthermore, the log-rank analysis indicated an increased hospital length of stay in the cohort with preoperative hemoglobin levels below 10 g/dL.

### Association of anaesthetists guidelines: The use of blood components and their alternatives [^116LqmPn]. Anaesthesia (2025). High credibility.

The Association of Anaesthetists (AoA) guidelines for 2025 provide recommendations on perioperative care for managing perioperative bleeding. These guidelines emphasize the management of preoperative anemia and the assessment and timing of surgery. A key recommendation is to minimize iatrogenic anemia by managing blood sampling appropriately.

### Preoperative anemia increases mortality and postoperative morbidity after cardiac surgery [^115G5SUG]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Finally, the best known risk stratification tools do not consider low hemoglobin level a potential predictor of adverse outcomes. These controversies have raised the question of whether preoperative anemia is a marker of other concomitant comorbidities such as advanced age, diabetes, and renal dysfunction, or a risk factor "per se". According to Ranucci et al, anemia is often excluded from the risk model because of the low prevalence of anemic patients in the examined populations and the strong correlation (multicollineratity) between low hemoglobin levels and other comorbidities. In our sample, one-quarter of patients were anemic, and we demonstrated that anemia was still an independent predictor of mortality and morbidity after adjusting for baseline characteristics and propensity score.

The association between preoperative anemia and adverse outcomes in patients after cardiac surgery may have several explanations. First, anemic patients are at risk for inadequate tissue oxygenation delivery during the peri-operative period, which may lead to impaired tissue oxygenation and organ dysfunction. Second, anemia is the most important predictor of hemodilution during cardiopulmonary bypass. It has been shown that low hematocrit levels are independently associated with mortality, stroke, and acute renal failure.

Finally, anemia is the strongest predictor of blood transfusions. It has been shown that blood cell transfusions in patients having cardiac surgery are strongly associated with increased mortality and morbidity. These results might be related to the functional and structural changes incurred during surgery.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^116KV1rN]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

How should patients be treated postoperatively?

Pharmacological optimization of postoperative hemoglobin and erythropoiesis should allow for the correction of iron deficiency and rapid recovery from postoperative anemia, which may lead to improved postoperative outcomes and enhanced quality of life. It may also result in a reduction of patient exposure to red cell transfusion and its related risks and complications, thus contributing further to improved surgical outcomes and patient safety.

- **Iron therapy: Oral vs. i.v. iron**:
	- The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK (NICE) recommends offering oral iron after surgery to patients with iron deficiency anemia. However, in the postoperative period, oral iron is often not tolerated or absorbed and has several limitations, including frequent gastrointestinal side effects and poor treatment adherence. Additionally, the inflammatory response induced by surgery stimulates hepcidin synthesis and release, which in turn inhibits intestinal iron absorption, making oral iron therapy largely ineffective. Various randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) in orthopedic and cardiac surgery patients have demonstrated that oral iron therapy was not better than placebo in correcting postoperative anemia and reducing transfusion requirements.

On the other hand, NICE recommends considering i.v. iron post-surgery for patients who have iron deficiency anemia and cannot tolerate or absorb oral iron, or are unable to adhere to oral iron treatment, as well as for those…

### Preoperative anemia treatment with intravenous iron in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery: A systematic review [^1158A4VU]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). Low credibility.

The 2018 Frankfurt Conference consensus statement strongly recommends the early detection and management of anemia before major elective surgeries, emphasizing the use of iron supplementation for patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA). These guidelines also suggest that clinicians consider adding short-acting erythropoietins to treatment regimens for anemic patients scheduled for major orthopedic surgery while recommending against the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. The British Society for Haematology further recommends the administration of intravenous (IV) iron when IDA is diagnosed close to the day of the surgery. However, prior systematic reviews of preoperative IV iron administration have found inadequate evidence for the intervention due to a limited number of randomized controlled trials and low power in the studies performed.

Therefore, we performed a systematic review to evaluate the evidence supporting IV iron administration as a preoperative treatment for anemia in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery. We focused primarily on improvements in the allogeneic blood transfusion (ABT) rate and secondarily examined evidence for improvements in morbidity, mortality, length of stay (LOS), and overall cost-effectiveness of the intervention. These results may be of interest to clinicians and hospital administrators evaluating the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of IV iron administration prior to major orthopedic surgery.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^1169JWhX]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Measurement of haemoglobin concentration is a routine procedure in postoperative care. The duration of testing for postoperative anaemia depends on the peri-operative bleeding risk associated with the surgical intervention and patient-dependent factors. In most cases of uncomplicated recovery from surgery, a nadir in haemoglobin concentration can be observed within the first 3–4 days after surgery. However, in patients with major complications following major surgery, prolonged hospitalisation and exposure to low haemoglobin levels increase the duration of monitoring required.

- **Point-of-care assessment**: Usually, blood gas analysis, capillary sampling (e.g. HemoCue, HemoCue AB, Ängelholm, Sweden), or near-infrared spectroscopy (e.g. Radical‐67, Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA) are performed as a point-of-care assessment, whereas the full blood count is tested in the central laboratory. The use of non-invasive continuous haemoglobin monitoring devices instead of phlebotomy may reduce blood loss, pain, and discomfort for the patient. However, concerns about precision limit routine clinical use. Although the debate focuses on the accuracy of a single check, the reliability of non-invasive haemoglobin monitoring devices for dynamic changes over time may permit detection of occult bleeding and response to therapy.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^112GLSj1]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

This consensus statement differs from other available statements and guidelines by focusing on the management of postoperative anaemia. While several professional associations have recommended systematic approaches for managing pre-operative anaemia, most guidelines suggest using a restrictive transfusion threshold for acute postoperative anaemia. However, recommendations for the pharmacological management of anaemia are scarce or even absent.

We aimed to update and utilise these recommendations to create a practical working document, based on scientific evidence and the clinical experience of an expert panel, to feasibly introduce these postoperative anaemia guidelines into clinical practice. Our goal was to provide pragmatic, clear, and easy-to-follow clinical guidance for diagnosing and treating postoperative anaemia and iron deficiency, improving patient recovery, reducing the need for blood transfusion, and enhancing functional outcomes in a cost-effective manner. Our recommendations target non-actively bleeding adult patients, where all principles of patient blood management (PBM) have been implemented pre- and intra-operatively for the prevention of postoperative iron deficiency and anaemia.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^113jWegH]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

The concept of 'patient blood management' (PBM) is defined as "the timely application of evidence-based medical and surgical concepts designed to manage anaemia, optimise haemostasis, and minimise blood loss in order to improve patient outcomes after surgery". Patient blood management has been shown to reduce transfusion, healthcare costs, and morbidity and mortality. Treatment of pre-operative anaemia and isolated iron deficiency are crucial measures for PBM. However, detection and early treatment of pre-operative anaemia and iron deficiency present a logistical challenge. As a result, some patients may undergo surgery without the chance to address their anaemia.

There has also been increased emphasis on accelerated discharge after surgery and the use of restrictive transfusion thresholds to improve outcomes and reduce transfusion requirements. This may have led to overlooking potential opportunities to optimise anaemic patients and improve their functional recovery. Therefore, focusing on the early detection and treatment of postoperative iron deficiency and anaemia is a novel and complementary measure within the concept of PBM. This allows the attending physician to target patients who lost significant red cell mass during surgery and may require specific attention postoperatively or following discharge.

### Surgical decision making around paediatric preoperative anaemia in low-income and middle-income countries [^115Txtew]. The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health (2019). Low credibility.

The prevalence of anaemia is high among children in low-income and middle-income countries. Anaemia is an important factor to consider preoperatively, as low haemoglobin concentrations can negatively affect surgical outcomes and lead to surgeries being cancelled or postponed. This can have adverse health implications and stretch already limited resources in these countries. Additionally, blood transfusions to correct anaemia expose children to safety issues. Therefore, in areas where anaemia is prevalent and resources are scarce, establishing a contextually appropriate and relatively safe minimum haemoglobin concentration for proceeding to surgery could substantially improve patient management and the efficiency of the health system. In this review, we consider why paediatric anaemia is a major public health issue in low-income and middle-income countries. We also examine the value of preoperative testing for anaemia and the methods of optimising haemoglobin concentrations in the context of paediatric surgeries in resource-limited settings.

### Impact of haemoglobin concentration on cardiovascular outcome after vascular surgery: a retrospective observational cohort study [^1117voxv]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Although low preoperative haemoglobin (Hb) concentration is a well-known risk factor for adverse outcomes, little is known about decreases in Hb and postoperative Hb concentrations.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of both pre- and postoperative Hb concentrations (divided into low, intermediate, and high tertiles), as well as Hb decrease, defined as preoperative minus postoperative Hb (g dl(-1)), on postoperative cardiovascular events in vascular surgery patients.

- **Design**: A retrospective observational cohort study.

- **Setting**: Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2011.

- **Patients**: One thousand four hundred and eighty-four patients underwent elective open or endovascular abdominal aortic repair (aneurysm or stenosis), lower extremity arterial repair, or carotid surgery. Patients for whom pre- or postoperative Hb concentrations were not available were excluded.

- **Main outcome measures**: The study endpoint was 30-day postoperative cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmias, stroke, asymptomatic troponin-T release, and cardiovascular death.

- **Results**: In 1,041 patients, both pre and postoperative Hb concentrations were available. Thirty-day cardiovascular events occurred in 221 (21%) patients. Multivariable logistic regression analyses, adjusting for age, sex, Revised Cardiac Risk Index (high-risk surgery, coronary heart disease, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency), hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.

### Adjusting current hemoglobin thresholds: A way to improve outcome in women undergoing major surgery [^1169p9uM]. Journal of Women's Health (2024). Low credibility.

In the perioperative setting, a suboptimal total hemoglobin (Hb) mass puts women and men at an unreasonable disadvantage. Anemia is an independent risk factor for transfusion, postoperative complications, and mortality. The Hb cut-off value for women was set at < 12.0 g/dL by the World Health Organization (WHO) and has been rigorously debated for decades. The aim of this study was to elucidate the risk for postoperative complications in female patients with Hb levels < 12.0, 12.0–12.9, and ≥ 13.0 g/dL.

- **Material and methods**: Single-center retrospective analysis of female patients undergoing major surgery.

- **Results**: In total, 6,516 patients ≥ 18 years of age had major surgery between 2018 and 2019, and 2,446 female patients were included in the analysis. The mean age was 67.4 ± 16.6, 66.4 ± 15.6, and 64.5 ± 15.5 years in female patients with preoperative Hb levels < 12.0, 12.0–12.9, and ≥ 13.0 g/dL, respectively. The transfusion rate of red blood cells (RBCs) was significantly higher in female patients with Hb < 12.0 g/dL (53%) and with Hb 12.0–12.9 g/dL (31%) compared to female patients ≥ 13.0 g/dL (22%). Rates of pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and sepsis were significantly higher in patients with Hb < 12.0 and 12.0–12.9 g/dL compared to patients with Hb ≥ 13.0 g/dL. The total length of hospital stay was significantly longer in female patients with Hb < 12.0 g/dL than in patients with Hb 12.0–12.9 g/dL and Hb ≥ 13.0 g/dL (10 days vs. 8 days).

Taken together, our data show that Hb values below 12.9 g/dL are associated with an increased probability of RBC transfusions and an increased risk of postoperative complications.

### Erythropoietin plus iron versus control treatment including placebo or iron for preoperative anaemic adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery [^117PBVBw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Approximately 30% of adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery suffer from preoperative anaemia. Preoperative anaemia is a risk factor for mortality and adverse outcomes in different surgical specialties and is frequently the reason for blood transfusion. The most common causes are renal, chronic diseases, and iron deficiency. International guidelines recommend that the cause of anaemia guide preoperative anaemia treatment. Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) with iron supplementation has frequently been used to increase preoperative haemoglobin concentrations in patients in order to avoid the need for perioperative allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy of preoperative rHuEPO therapy (subcutaneous or parenteral) with iron (enteral or parenteral) in reducing the need for allogeneic RBC transfusions in preoperatively anaemic adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid Embase, ISI Web of Science: SCI-EXPANDED and CPCI-S, and clinical trial registries WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov on 29 August 2019.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared preoperative rHuEPO + iron therapy to control treatment (placebo, no treatment, or standard of care with or without iron) for preoperatively anaemic adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery. We used the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of anaemia: haemoglobin concentration (g/dL) less than 13 g/dL for males, and 12 g/dL for non-pregnant females.

### Effect of relative decrease in blood hemoglobin concentrations on postoperative morbidity in patients who undergo major gastrointestinal surgery [^111JdWeK]. JAMA Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Delta hemoglobin (ΔHb), defined as the difference between the preoperative hemoglobin (Hb) level and the nadir Hb level during a patient's hospitalization, may be associated with adverse outcomes even if the absolute level of Hb remains greater than the transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the association between ΔHb and morbidity in patients who undergo major gastrointestinal surgery as an independent factor or combined with the nadir Hb concentration.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data on patients who underwent pancreatic, hepatic, or colorectal resection from January 1, 2010, through April 30, 2014, at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Data regarding the ΔHb concentration following surgery, nadir Hb level, and overall perioperative blood use were obtained and analyzed. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models were used to identify the preoperative factors associated with ΔHb and the effect of ΔHb on perioperative morbidity. The study and data analysis took place from January 22 through February 20, 2015.

- **Interventions**: Major gastrointestinal surgery and packed red blood cell transfusion.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Overall morbidity and ischemic-specific complications.

- **Results**: Of the 4669 patients who underwent major gastrointestinal surgery, the median ΔHb level after surgery was 40%. Patients with multiple comorbidities (American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status score of 3–4: odds ratio [OR], 1.96; 95% CI, 1.30–2.97; P < 0.001; ≥ 3 coexisting medical conditions) were included.

### Preoperative hemoglobin level as a predictor of mortality after aortic valve replacement [^112ZJ98V]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

The predictive value of preoperative hemoglobin (HB) level on the outcome of patients undergoing valve surgery is not well established. This study evaluated the predictive value of preoperative HB level on survival after aortic valve replacement (AVR).

- **Design**: This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data.

- **Setting**: A single-center study performed in an educational hospital.

- **Participants**: All consecutive patients (n = 1,808) who underwent AVR between January 1998 and December 2010.

- **Interventions and measurements**: Patients were classified into four groups according to the preoperative HB level: very low (HB < 12 g/dL)low, normal, and high normal.

- **Main results**: The 30-day mortality rate was 26.1% in the very-low-HB group, 23.7% in the low-HB group, 17.1% in the normal-HB group, and 12.6% in the high-normal-HB group (p < 0.0001). The multivariate logistic regression model did not identify low HB as an independent predictor for early mortality. Cox regression multivariate analysis revealed both HB level, as a continuous variable…

### Intraoperative transfusion practices in Europe [^115wCz24]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Across Europe, the vast majority of elective surgical patients receiving one or more units of RBC intraoperatively are anaemic at the commencement of surgery (Hb 10.6 g dl−1), and correction of anaemia before surgery deserves further study. Although the transfusion trigger (Hb 8.1 g dl−1) is probably appropriate intraoperatively, post-transfusion Hb values were uniformly high (Hb 9.8 g dl−1), suggesting an opportunity to use a single unit transfusion stratagem. Physiological transfusion triggers seem to be the most important catalyst for transfusion intraoperatively. However, the physiological triggers mainly used, such as hypotension and tachycardia, might have a low discriminative power for tissue hypoperfusion and often occur at Hb values that are considered safe for tissue oxygenation in most patients.

### Does preoperative hemoglobin independently predict short-term outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^115U9vjp]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The role of preoperative hemoglobin in predicting short-term coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery outcomes has not been well established. This study investigated the association between preoperative hemoglobin levels with 30-day operative mortality and perioperative complications.

- **Methods**: For the period from 1997 to 2005, the Department of Veterans Affairs Continuous Improvement in Cardiac Surgery Program database was used to extract 36,658 CABG-only deidentified records for patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. Univariate and multivariate statistical models were used to predict both mortality and morbidity outcomes for varying levels of hemoglobin.

- **Results**: Unadjusted odds of 30-day operative mortality for patients with preoperative hemoglobin level less than 10 g/dL were 2.37 times higher than for patients with hemoglobin levels of 10 g/dL or greater (95% confidence interval: 1.84 to 3.05; p < 0.0001). The multivariable effect upon 30-day operative mortality decreased considerably (odds ratio = 1.29, 95% confidence interval: 0.99 to 1.68; p = 0.064).

- **Conclusions**: As several risk factors may occur concurrently with low hemoglobin, preoperative hemoglobin level less than 10 g/dL was not a strong independent predictor of 30-day operative mortality or perioperative morbidity in multivariate models for on-pump CABG-only patients. Hemoglobin and serum creatinine were correlated, with creatinine exhibiting the stronger association with mortality. These findings suggest that moderate or severe anemia may be intertwined with other risk factors, such as serum creatinine.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^111Egb6N]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Low pre‐operative haemoglobin, female sex, and smaller body surface area have been identified as risk factors for the development of postoperative anaemia and increased transfusion needs. Additionally, in the general population, the prevalence of anaemia increases with age; older persons are more likely to undergo major surgery and present with comorbidities, thus increasing the risk of postoperative anaemia and reducing its tolerability.

The end of the surgical procedure does not always signify the end of blood loss. Ongoing postoperative blood loss can continue through drains, into traumatised tissue, or due to repeated phlebotomy during prolonged postoperative hospitalisation. As such, peri‐operative blood loss may result in acute or late postoperative anaemia, especially in patients with the aforementioned risk factors. To avoid the detrimental effects of acute anaemia, packed red blood cells are usually transfused as a default measure. However, the use of restrictive transfusion thresholds, as emphasised in the third pillar of PBM, also contributes to a higher prevalence of moderate‐to‐severe anaemia on discharge from hospital (haemoglobin concentration < 100 g.l −1), unless proactive measures are implemented.

Anaemia in the postoperative period, as well as in critical illness, may be aggravated by reduced erythropoietin production and secretion due to inflammatory mediators, blunted bone marrow response to erythropoietin, and decreased iron availability.

### Critical preoperative hemoglobin value to predict anemia-related complications after cardiac surgery [^112X8Rq7]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Low credibility.

Preoperative anemia is frequent in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and is associated with increased postoperative complications. The purpose of this observational study was to estimate the critical preoperative hemoglobin threshold associated with the occurrence of complications after cardiac surgery.

- **Design**: A retrospective observational cohort study.

- **Setting**: A tertiary-care medical center from January 2019 to April 2020.

- **Participants**: A total of 1,004 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery were included.

- **Interventions**: None (observational study).

- **Measurements and main results**: The primary study endpoint was to define the hemoglobin threshold that predicted the occurrence of postoperative major complications after elective cardiac surgery. Postoperative complications were a composite criterion, including transient ischemic attack or stroke, myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, mediastinitis, or mesenteric ischemia.

	- A discrimination threshold was determined using receiver operating characteristic curves. The discrimination threshold for hemoglobin concentration with the best sensitivity/specificity ratio for the occurrence of postoperative complications was 13 g/dL for male patients and 11.8 g/dL for female patients. The incidence of postoperative complications was 17.2% in the total population. Independent risks were preoperative hemoglobin concentration, red blood cell transfusion, European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II, and the type of surgery.

### Return on investment of preoperative anemia management programs in cardiac surgery: An advisory from the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists Clinical Practice Improvement Committee with endorsement by the Society for the Advancement of Patient Blood Management [^114UTbS7]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Low credibility.

Despite multiple recent guidelines recommending the diagnosis and treatment of anemia before elective cardiac surgery, few institutions have formal programs or methods in place to accomplish this. A major limitation is the perceived financial shortfall and the leadership buy-in required to undertake such an initiative. The purpose of this advisory from the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists (SCA) Clinical Practice Improvement Committee, with endorsement by the Society for the Advancement of Patient Blood Management (SABM), is to provide an overview of preoperative anemia management programs with an emphasis on the associated financial implications.

### Liberal or restrictive transfusion after cardiac surgery [^116JJmiX]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Whether a restrictive threshold for hemoglobin level in red-cell transfusions, as compared with a liberal threshold, reduces postoperative morbidity and health care costs after cardiac surgery is uncertain.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicenter, parallel-group trial in which patients older than 16 years of age who were undergoing nonemergency cardiac surgery were recruited from 17 centers in the United Kingdom. Patients with a postoperative hemoglobin level of less than 9 g per deciliter were randomly assigned to a restrictive transfusion threshold (hemoglobin level < 7.5 g per deciliter) or a liberal transfusion threshold (hemoglobin level < 9 g per deciliter). The primary outcome was a serious infection (sepsis or wound infection) or an ischemic event (permanent stroke [confirmation on brain imaging and deficit in motor, sensory, or coordination functions], myocardial infarction, infarction of the gut, or acute kidney injury) within 3 months after randomization. Health care costs, excluding the index surgery, were estimated from the day of surgery to 3 months after surgery.

- **Results**: A total of 2007 patients underwent randomization; 4 participants withdrew, leaving 1000 in the restrictive-threshold group and 1003 in the liberal-threshold group. Transfusion rates after randomization were 53.4% and 92.2% in the two groups, respectively. The primary outcome occurred in 35.1% of the patients in the restrictive-threshold group and 33.0% of the patients in the liberal-threshold group (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.34; P = 0.30).

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^117CfN5G]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

When and how to measure postoperative iron deficiency?

Although the underlying causes of postoperative anaemia are multifactorial, iron deficiency is often present. Pre‐operative iron deficiency can be diagnosed based on low ferritin concentrations. However, diagnosing postoperative iron deficiency is more challenging, as ferritin levels may be elevated due to the acute phase inflammatory response following surgery. Therefore, patients undergoing major surgery with a high risk of developing moderate‐to‐severe postoperative anaemia should have their haemoglobin and iron status checked on the day of surgery if not already assessed pre-operatively. This also applies to patients with ongoing bleeding and anaemia, such as those with colorectal cancer, who were treated during the pre‐operative period.

As ferritin levels will not be elevated by inflammation immediately after surgery, a postoperative ferritin concentration of less than 100 μg/l within 24 hours after surgery indicates insufficient iron stores to support erythropoiesis, potentially leading to significant drops in postoperative haemoglobin. Further markers of postoperative iron deficiency include transferrin saturation below 20% with ferritin concentrations between 100–300 μg/l, or reticulocyte haemoglobin content below 28 pg. These values and parameters may signal the need for intervention in anaemic patients.

### Preoperative anemia-screening clinics [^115qzz8p]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Low credibility.

Preoperative anemia is associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality, as well as an increased risk of perioperative transfusion. It serves as an important and modifiable risk factor for surgical patients. Specifically, for high-blood-loss surgery, preoperative anemia is defined as hemoglobin levels less than 13 g/dL for both male and female patients. This condition is prevalent, affecting 25% to 40% of patients in large observational studies.

The most frequent treatable cause of preoperative anemia is iron-deficiency anemia, which should be the primary focus of initial laboratory tests to confirm diagnosis. Management involves iron supplementation, with intravenous (IV) iron therapy used when oral iron is ineffective or not tolerated, particularly in cases of severe anemia and when surgery is imminent (less than 4 weeks away). In certain situations, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents might be considered, especially for patients with multiple alloantibodies or religious objections to transfusions.

The establishment of preoperative anemia-screening clinics is essential to facilitate effective diagnosis and management. The primary goals in managing preoperative anemia are to treat the condition, minimize the need for transfusions, and improve patient outcomes.

### Association between preoperative hemoglobin with length of hospital stay among non-cardiac and non-obstetric surgery patients: a secondary analysis of a retrospective cohort study [^111kjogn]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

This retrospective cohort study investigated the effect of preoperative hemoglobin (HB) level on the length of hospital stay (LOS) in non-cardiac and non-obstetric patients. By adjusting for potential risk factors related to LOS, we showed that patients with prolonged hospitalization had a low preoperative HB level and a high prevalence of moderate-to-severe anemia, aligning with previous results. These findings suggest that more attention should be given to this group of patients to detect anemia-related symptoms promptly and provide iron supplements, vitamin B12, and blood transfusion treatment when necessary.

In addition, we found that the incidence of preoperative anemia was 61.7% in non-cardiac and non-obstetric patients, with mild and moderate-to-severe anemia incidences of 21.9% and 39.9%, respectively. These results conflict with previous studies indicating that the incidence of anemia in patients without cardiac surgery was 28.7–30.44%. Such a discrepancy could be explained by different patient characteristics and the criteria for defining anemia in different studies. Indeed, some researchers employed hemoglobin levels to define anemia, while others used hematocrit values.

Clinically, a lack of hematopoietic raw materials, including iron, folic acid, vitamin B12, and chronic diseases such as chronic infection, tumors, and chronic renal insufficiency, may lead to preoperative anemia. Additionally, some patients may experience unexplained anemia due to multiple complex mechanisms. If such a symptom is not treated promptly and efficiently, the procedure…

### Preoperative anemia and transfusion in cardiac surgery: a single-centre retrospective study [^114Y7JBe]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Anemia is common in patients undergoing surgery, especially in cardiac surgery. The prevalence of preoperative anemia among patients undergoing cardiac surgery is highly variable, depending on the definition of anemia used across studies as well as center-specific patient populations. Using the World Health Organization (WHO) definition, the general consensus for preoperative anemia prevalence is around 20–30% and increases with age and the presence of comorbidities. The most common causes of preoperative anemia in cardiac surgery patients are hospital-acquired anemia, iron-deficiency anemia, and anemia of chronic disease. The risk of anemia is exacerbated in cardiac surgery patients due to acute hemodilution associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), perioperative phlebotomy, and surgical blood loss. Preoperative anemia is associated with higher morbidity and mortality, longer intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays, and increased health care costs.

Preoperative anemia also increases perioperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion rates in cardiac surgery patients. Allogeneic blood transfusions are a scarce and costly resource that carry significant risks including transfusion reactions, transfusion-related immunomodulation, infectious complications, and other systemic adverse effects. Similar to preoperative anemia, blood transfusion in cardiac surgery is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, lengths of hospital stay, and health care costs.

### An effective and efficient testing protocol for diagnosing iron-deficiency anemia preoperatively [^114zFjPX]. Anesthesiology (2020). Low credibility.

Iron-deficiency anemia is a common perioperative condition and increases perioperative morbidity and mortality. Timely diagnosis and treatment are important. This retrospective cohort study tested the hypothesis that a newly developed preprocedure evaluation protocol diagnoses more patients with iron-deficiency anemia than the traditional practice of obtaining a complete blood count followed by iron studies.

- **Methods**: The preprocedure anemia evaluation is an order for a complete blood count and reflex anemia testing, which can be completed with a single patient visit. A hemoglobin concentration of 12g/dl or less with serum ferritin concentration less than 30ng/ml or transferrin saturation less than 20% defined iron-deficiency anemia. Northwestern Medicine's database was queried for preoperative clinic patients, age 16 to 89 years, before (2015 to 2016) and after (2017 to 2018) protocol implementation. The proportion of patients diagnosed with iron-deficiency anemia before and after the preprocedure anemia evaluation implementation was compared.

- **Results**: Before implementing the protocol, 8,816 patients were screened with a traditional complete blood count, and subsequent iron studies at the providers' discretion diagnosed 107 (1.2%) patients with iron-deficiency anemia. Some patients were still screened with a complete blood count after implementing the protocol; 154 of 4,629 (3.3%) patients screened with a complete blood count and 738 of 2,828 (26.1%) patients screened with the preprocedure anemia evaluation were diagnosed with iron-deficiency anemia.

### Should transfusion trigger thresholds differ for critical care versus perioperative patients? A meta-analysis of randomized trials [^116AitPg]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). High credibility.

The systematic search retrieved 6,055 citations (PRISMA Flowchart, Supplemental Digital Content 2; legend, Supplemental Digital Content 11). Ultimately, 27 RCTs including 10,797 patients met the inclusion criteria. Twelve trials included primarily critically ill patients, and 15 included primarily surgical (perioperative) patients. For the restrictive transfusion strategy, the trigger threshold was typically defined as a hemoglobin concentration of 7–8 g/dL, and for the liberal transfusion strategy, the trigger was typically between hemoglobin 9 and 10 g/dL. Excluded studies are detailed in the online appendix (Supplemental Digital Content 3; legend, Supplemental Digital Content 11).

- **Baseline characteristics of included studies**: Seventeen studies were deemed at moderate risk of bias, and the remaining 10 were at high risk of bias (Risk of Bias Assessment, Supplemental Digital Content 4; legend, Supplemental Digital Content 11).

- **Mortality at 30 days**: In critical care patients, the restrictive transfusion strategy resulted in significantly reduced 30-day mortality compared with a liberal transfusion strategy (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70–0.97; NNTB = 33; p = 0.019). In contrast, in surgical patients, the restrictive transfusion strategy led to the opposite direction of effect for 30-day mortality (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.94–1.82; p = 0.12), though not reaching conventional levels of significance. More importantly, the test for interaction across the critical care and perioperative groups did not reach statistical significance, highlighting the need for further investigation into the context-specific implications of transfusion strategies.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^112fptXx]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

What are the true risks and contraindications of i.v. iron?

Many clinicians and health authorities still consider that i.v. iron is strongly associated with major side effects such as anaphylaxis, infection, or oxidative stress. However, these side effects appear not to be significant with the newer i.v. iron preparations such as ferric carboxymaltose, iron isomaltoside, and low molecular weight iron dextran.

After an extensive review of the data, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that "all i.v. iron medicines have a small risk of causing allergic reactions which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly". However, the reported incidence of potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions (< 1:250,000 administrations) is vastly overestimated. The pathophysiological mechanism is poorly understood, although a substantial proportion is thought to be mediated by complement activation, resulting in complement activation-related pseudo allergy (CARPA). Minor infusion reactions due to 'labile' iron may occur, but are usually self-limiting without intervention and should not be misinterpreted as acute hypersensitivity events.

The CHMP's review also concluded that "the benefits of these medicines are greater than their risks, provided that adequate measures are taken to minimise the risk of allergic reactions". To this end, i.v. iron preparations should only be given in an environment where resuscitation facilities are available, so that patients who develop an allergic re…

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^116BGimw]. Anaesthesia (2018). High credibility.

Despite numerous guidelines on the management of anaemia in surgical patients, there is no pragmatic guidance for the diagnosis and management of anaemia and iron deficiency in the postoperative period. A number of experienced researchers and clinicians took part in a two-day expert workshop and developed the following consensus statement. After presenting our own research data and local policies and procedures, relevant literature was reviewed and discussed. We developed a series of best-practice and evidence-based statements to advise on patient care with respect to anaemia and iron deficiency in the postoperative period.

- **Diagnostic approach**: A diagnostic approach to iron deficiency and anaemia in surgical patients was established.
- **Patient identification**: Identification of patients appropriate for treatment was outlined.
- **Practical management**: Advice on practical management and follow-up that is easy to implement was provided.

Available data allow the fulfilment of the requirements of Pillar 1 of Patient Blood Management. We urge national and international research funding bodies to take note of these recommendations, particularly in terms of funding large-scale prospective, randomised clinical trials that can most effectively address the important clinical questions and this clearly unmet medical need.

### Detection, evaluation, and management of preoperative anaemia in the elective orthopaedic surgical patient: NATA guidelines [^112sZiqD]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

We propose an algorithm for the detection, evaluation, and management of preoperative anaemia based on the above recommendations.

- **Algorithm details**: If anaemia is detected on a screening sample, evaluation is necessary and begins with an assessment of iron status. If serum ferritin, transferrin saturation levels, or both indicate absolute iron deficiency, referral to a gastroenterologist to rule out a gastrointestinal malignancy as a source of chronic blood loss may be indicated. If serum ferritin, transferrin saturation values, or both rule out absolute iron deficiency, serum creatinine and GFR determination may indicate CKD and the need for referral to a nephrologist. When serum ferritin, transferrin saturation values, or both are inconclusive, further evaluation to rule out absolute iron deficiency or inflammation/chronic disease is necessary. A therapeutic trial of iron would confirm absolute iron deficiency. No response to iron therapy would indicate the anaemia of chronic disease, suggesting that ESA therapy be initiated.

These recommendations are intended to provide guidance for preoperative evaluation in the elective surgical patient. Limiting preadmission testing to a few days before the scheduled operative procedure precludes the opportunity to evaluate and manage the patient with unexplained anaemia. The recommended time frame of testing is 4 weeks prior to surgery.

### Identification and management of preoperative anaemia in adults: A British Society for Haematology guideline update [^115B3gQo]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for perioperative bleeding, specifically in relation to the management of preoperative anemia, assessment, and timing of surgery, the BSH 2024 guidelines recommend considering the referral of patients with unexplained anemia without iron deficiency. This should be done according to the severity of anemia, defined as hemoglobin levels less than 120 g/L for males and less than 100 g/L for females, or based on locally agreed criteria. It is important to recognize that the risk of a serious cause or hemoglobinopathy is proportional to the severity of anemia.

### Threshold heterogeneity of perioperative hemoglobin drop for acute kidney injury after noncardiac surgery: a propensity score weighting analysis [^117SNxZN]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

Perioperative hemoglobin drop in noncardiac surgery is related to postoperative kidney injury. Preoperative hemoglobin level is a critical risk factor for postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI). There is no recognized tolerance threshold for postoperative hemoglobin reduction among different preoperative hemoglobin levels. These parameters are essential for the prevention of perioperative renal injury.

We assume that hemoglobin drop within 7 days after the operation will affect perioperative AKI and that patients with different preoperative hemoglobin statuses have different tolerance thresholds. Based on this hypothesis, this retrospective observational study aimed to identify the hemoglobin drop threshold of patients with different preoperative hemoglobin levels. Moreover, the study sought to understand the relationship between hemoglobin reduction and blood creatinine level within 7 days after surgery.

### Detection, evaluation, and management of preoperative anaemia in the elective orthopaedic surgical patient: NATA guidelines [^114iYEvD]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

- **Detection of anaemia**:
	- **Recommendation 1**: We recommend that elective surgical patients have an Hb level determination as close to 28 days before the scheduled surgical procedure as possible (Grade 1C). The Circular of Information for Blood and Blood Products has recommended that iron, vitamin B12, folic acid, and erythropoietin be used instead of blood transfusion, 'if the clinical condition of the patient permits sufficient time for those agents to promote erythropoiesis… '. The key phrase relevant to this recommendation is 'sufficient time to promote erythropoiesis'. Detection of anaemia as close to 28 days before surgery is recommended for sufficient time for evaluation and management.

- **Recommendation 2**: We suggest that the patient's target Hb before elective surgery be within the normal range (female ≥ 12 g dl−1, male ≥ 13 g dl−1), according to the WHO criteria (Grade 2C). This recommendation is a suggestion, indicating a lack of panel consensus and evidence on whether elective surgical procedures should be cancelled, representing best practices. For patients who are identified to be anaemic, delaying elective scheduled surgery for definitive evaluation of newly detected anaemia and associated clinical conditions (nutritional deficiency, chronic renal disease, etc) will benefit patients and reduce harm, including the likelihood of exposure to blood transfusions.

### Pre-operative haematological assessment in patients scheduled for major surgery [^113eVAAm]. Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Peri-operative anaemia, blood loss, and allogeneic blood transfusion are associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality, as well as prolonged hospital stay. A multidisciplinary, multimodal, individualised strategy, collectively termed 'patient blood management', may reduce or eliminate allogeneic blood transfusion and improve outcomes. This approach has three objectives: the detection and treatment of peri-operative anaemia, the reduction of peri-operative bleeding and coagulopathy, and harnessing and optimising the physiological tolerance of anaemia. This review focuses on the pre-operative evaluation of erythropoiesis, coagulation status, and platelet function. Where possible, evidence is graded systematically, and recommended therapies follow recently published consensus guidance.

### Identification and management of preoperative anaemia in adults: A British Society for Haematology guideline update [^115UUWx6]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). High credibility.

In the context of iron deficiency anemia, especially concerning patients undergoing surgery, the BSH 2024 guidelines recommend treating hemoglobin levels below 130 g/L as the threshold. At this level, patients are likely to benefit from screening for iron and/or other nutrient deficiencies and implementing enhanced patient blood management measures.

### Preoperative haemoglobin concentration and mortality rate after coronary artery bypass surgery [^115JrzUh]. Lancet (2002). Low credibility.

We conducted an observational study involving 2,059 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery to assess the effect of haemoglobin concentration on in-hospital mortality. We noted that individuals with a preoperative haemoglobin concentration of 100 g/L or less had a five-fold higher in-hospital mortality rate after surgery than those with a higher haemoglobin concentration, despite having had blood transfusions or the pump primed with blood preoperatively as a routine precaution. Our findings suggest that a low haemoglobin concentration is a marker of disease severity or comorbidity that has a major effect on survival rate.

### Perioperative patient blood management to improve outcomes [^112KHCko]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is common in elective surgery and is an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Historically, the management of anemia has focused on the use of allogeneic blood transfusion, but this approach is not without risk as it has also been independently associated with morbidity and mortality. Additionally, there are concerns about costs and relative shortages of this resource. In recognition of these challenges, patient blood management (PBM) emphasizes the patient's own blood as a resource to be conserved and managed appropriately as a standard of care.

- **The three pillars of PBM**: PBM consists of the optimization of red blood cell mass, reduction of blood loss and bleeding, and optimization of the patient's physiological tolerance toward anemia. By integrating these pillars into multimodal care bundles and strategies incorporated into perioperative pathways, care processes and patient outcomes can be improved.

Preoperative anemia is most commonly caused by functional iron deficiency and should be addressed with oral iron, intravenous iron, and/or recombinant erythropoietin. An individualized assessment of the thrombotic risk associated with discontinuing anticoagulant and antiplatelet medication should be balanced against the risk of perioperative bleeding. Neuraxial anesthetic techniques should be considered, and minimally invasive surgery should be undertaken when appropriate. If significant blood loss is anticipated, cell salvage should be employed. Pharmacological treatments such as tranexamic acid and fibrin sealants have been shown to reduce blood loss. Additionally, point-of-care tests can guide the perioperative management of anemia.

### Preoperative hemoglobin < 10 g/dL predicts an increase in major adverse cardiac events in patients with hip fracture over 80 years: A retrospective cohort study [^115TZXdy]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2023). Low credibility.

The continuous variables are presented as the mean (SD), and the proportion is presented for categorical variables. The enrolled patients were divided into four cohorts as indicated by the transfusion guidelines for comparison of baseline characteristics. For analysis of variance, the chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, or Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test were applied as appropriate. To explore the association between the level of preoperative hemoglobin and all endpoints of elderly patients over 80 years undergoing hip fracture surgery, restricted cubic spline curves (RCSs) were used based on Cox proportional hazards models with four knots at the 5th, 35th, 65th, and 95th percentiles. The analyses were adjusted for age, sex, preoperative days, and comorbidities. Primary and secondary outcomes were analyzed using both unadjusted regressions and adjusted multivariable regression, with a preoperative hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL as the reference group based on the RCS curve. For sensitivity analyses, the subgroup of patients aged from 80 years to 89 years were tested for all endpoints. A two-tailed P value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were processed using SPSS 26.0 and R version 4.0.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^112mxa3u]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

When should postoperative anaemia be treated? There are limited supporting data regarding appropriate timing for management of anaemia after surgery, including red cell transfusion. Treatment choice depends on severity and type of anaemia, type of surgery, patient comorbidities, and the presence of any surgical complications.

Iron supplementation should be considered in patients with iron deficiency or significant reduction in postoperative haemoglobin, starting early in the postoperative recovery phase where there are no major complications. It is important to note that there are no studies identifying the best time to start postoperative iron supplementation.

For non-cancer patients with severe postoperative anaemia and inflammation-induced blunted erythropoiesis or those declining blood transfusion, additional treatment with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (e.g. recombinant human erythropoietin [rHuEPO]) may be considered. However, it is acknowledged that for patients without a previous indication, this is an off-label use of rHuEPO, and recommendations vary across countries.

Red cell transfusion should be restricted to patients with severe anaemia (haemoglobin < 70–80 g.l−1) and clinical signs and symptoms. Red cell transfusion should be considered in patients with active bleeding and in those severely anaemic once bleeding has been stopped. However, more research is required on specific transfusion thresholds in specific high-risk patients.

### Risks associated with preoperative anemia and perioperative blood transfusion in open surgery for intracranial aneurysms [^1157c82E]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2015). Low credibility.

Preoperative anemia may be treated with a blood transfusion. Both conditions are associated with adverse outcomes in various surgical procedures, but this has not been clearly elucidated in surgery for cerebral aneurysms. In this study, the authors assessed the association of preoperative anemia and perioperative blood transfusion, separately, on 30-day morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing open surgery for ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms.

- **Methods**: The authors identified 668 cases (including 400 unruptured and 268 ruptured intracranial aneurysms) of open surgery for treatment of intracranial aneurysms in the 2006–2012 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, a validated and reproducible prospective clinical database. Anemia was defined as a hematocrit level less than 39% in males and less than 36% in females. Perioperative transfusion was defined as at least 1 unit of packed or whole red blood cells given at any point between the start of surgery to 72 hours postoperatively. The authors separately compared surgical outcomes between patients with (n = 198) versus without (n = 470) anemia, and those who underwent (n = 78) versus those who did not receive (n = 521) a transfusion, using a 1:1 match on propensity score.

- **Results**: In the matched cohorts, all observed covariates were comparable between anemic (n = 147) versus nonanemic (n = 147) and between transfused (n = 67) versus nontransfused patients (n = 67). Anemia was independently associated with prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS; odds ratio [OR] 2.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4–4.5).

### Identification and management of preoperative anaemia in adults: A British Society for Haematology guideline update [^113amRvu]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). High credibility.

The British Society for Haematology (BSH) 2024 guidelines emphasize the importance of assessing and timing surgery in patients with iron deficiency anemia, particularly those undergoing surgery. It is recommended to consider referring patients with unexplained anemia, which is not due to iron deficiency, based on the severity of the anemia. This is specifically defined as hemoglobin levels below 120 g/L for males and below 100 g/L for females, or according to locally agreed criteria. The guidelines recognize that the risk of a serious cause or hemoglobinopathy is proportional to the severity of the anemia.

### Perioperative quality initiative and enhanced recovery after surgery-cardiac society consensus statement on the management of preoperative anemia and iron deficiency in adult cardiac surgery patients [^116sVFaz]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Low credibility.

Preoperative anemia is common in patients presenting for cardiac surgery, with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 4, and has been associated with worse outcomes, including an increased risk of blood transfusion, kidney injury, stroke, infection, and death. Iron deficiency, a major cause of anemia, has also been shown to be associated with worse outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, even in the absence of anemia.

Although recent guidelines have supported diagnosing and treating anemia and iron deficiency before elective surgery, details on when and how to screen and treat remain unclear. The Eighth Perioperative Quality Initiative (POQI 8) consensus conference, in conjunction with the Enhanced Recovery after Surgery-Cardiac Surgery Society, brought together an international, multidisciplinary team of experts to review and evaluate the literature on screening, diagnosing, and managing preoperative anemia and iron deficiency in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The aim was to provide evidence-based recommendations in accordance with Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria for evaluating biomedical literature.
