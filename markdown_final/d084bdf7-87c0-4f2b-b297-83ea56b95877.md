## Question

guidelines for fibroscan for fatty liver

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for guidelines on when and how to use FibroScan (vibration-controlled transient elastography, VCTE) for fatty liver disease (NAFLD/MASLD), including indications, interpretation cutoffs, modifiers, special populations, and longitudinal follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about FibroScan's placement in the care pathway relative to simple blood scores. Then, I should verify the evidence-based cutoffs for ruling in and ruling out advanced fibrosis and how to handle the indeterminate zone. Next, I will consider test modifiers and when to prefer MRE. After that, I should review condition-specific thresholds beyond MASLD. Finally, I will outline monitoring intervals and special populations, and close with a unified algorithmic summary that aligns with major guidelines.

> Let me first confirm where FibroScan fits in the pathway, because I need to ensure we don't overuse a specialist test in primary care. The consistent approach is a two-step strategy: start with a simple, inexpensive blood-based score such as FIB-4, and if FIB-4 is at least 1.3 or indeterminate, proceed to VCTE/MRE/ELF as second-line to further stratify fibrosis risk, which improves cost-effectiveness and reduces unnecessary specialty referrals [^111EWoPD] [^116ochts] [^114WCTNs].

> I should confirm who needs FibroScan after step one, and not jump to conclusions. Indications include an indeterminate or high FIB-4 and high-risk groups such as those with T2DM, metabolic syndrome or obesity, persistent aminotransferase elevation over 6 months, or steatosis on imaging, with case-finding endorsed by endocrine and hepatology societies; in these groups, second-line VCTE clarifies fibrosis burden before deciding on referral or biopsy [^115ZNXX8] [^112wYGNz] [^114xw7u8] [^1173p2jy].

> Next, I need to interpret FibroScan using evidence-based cutoffs, and I should double-check the rule-out versus rule-in performance. For NAFLD/MASLD, a dual-cutoff strategy is supported: below 8.0 kPa, advanced fibrosis is effectively ruled out with high sensitivity and NPV; above 12.0 kPa, advanced fibrosis is ruled in with high specificity; between 8.0 and 12.0 kPa is a gray zone often requiring biopsy, alternative NITs such as MRE/ELF, or close follow-up, acknowledging TE has better NPV than PPV in this setting [^113snANe].

> Wait, I remember older lower thresholds being quoted, so let me verify and reconcile. Earlier UK guidance sometimes used lower operational thresholds for referral, for example FibroScan around 7.8 kPa in an indeterminate context, but more recent consensus for NAFLD supports the 8 and 12 kPa cutoffs to balance sensitivity and specificity; in practice, some clinicians consider biopsy discussion around 8.0–8.5 kPa when diagnostic uncertainty is high or treatment decisions hinge on staging, so I should state both the updated standard and the pragmatic nuance [^117CHg7V] [^113snANe].

> Now, I need to ensure I account for factors that can falsely elevate or degrade accuracy, and I should verify probe and timing considerations. Obesity may require an XL probe, acute inflammation and cholestasis can raise LSM, active alcohol use should prompt repeat assessment after at least four weeks of abstinence if AST is greater than about 70 U/L or bilirubin is elevated, recent meals can increase LSM so a short fast helps, and in situations where ultrasound-based elastography accuracy is compromised or cross-sectional imaging is needed, MRE is preferred given better performance in obese patients and reduced operator dependency [^113QFrqt] [^113SitcU] [^111g7uQY].

> Hold on, I should verify disease-specific thresholds beyond MASLD because clinicians often ask about ALD, cholestatic diseases, and viral hepatitis. For alcohol-related liver disease, values in the 12–15 kPa range are commonly used to rule in advanced fibrosis and predict liver-related events in compensated disease; for primary biliary cholangitis, 8 kPa and 15 kPa stratify low and high risk; in chronic HCV, around 12.5 kPa detects cirrhosis, while after SVR a cutoff near 9.5 kPa can help rule out advanced fibrosis; for chronic HBV, a threshold near 11.0 kPa is suggested to detect cirrhosis; in PSC, in the absence of obstruction, around 8 kPa may indicate advanced parenchymal damage, though validation is limited, so context is crucial [^113xQUus] [^114UXPa7] [^112Q613s] [^111igV8E] [^115JVJqn] [^113t8esz] [^1177ZbwH].

> Let me think about longitudinal use and follow-up intervals, and I should confirm we are not overpromising serial LSM as a stand-alone progression tool. Low-risk patients by FIB-4 and LSM can be reassessed every one to three years in primary care, with tighter surveillance if risk factors worsen; while a rising LSM may signal progression, guidance emphasizes interpreting longitudinal increases or decreases within clinical context and with awareness of modifiers, and cautions against using imaging-based NITs alone to declare regression or progression without supportive evidence [^113DtiLm] [^114Maziq] [^113biJp8] [^1179MW9P]. But wait, what if I consider a more specific numerical change such as a greater than 20% rise in kPa as a trigger; I should be careful here, because formal guidelines favor individualized interpretation rather than a fixed percentage rule, so I will frame any threshold as a signal that warrants specialist review rather than a definitive diagnosis of progression [^113biJp8] [^1179MW9P].

> Next, I should review special populations, and I need to check whether the standard adult algorithm holds. In lean NAFLD, the same two-step paradigm applies, but clinicians should maintain a broader differential and confirm fibrosis stage with a second NIT when initial tests are indeterminate; in type 1 diabetes, targeted screening with FIB-4 is reasonable only if other risk factors such as obesity or elevated ALT are present; in children, different thresholds and approaches are required, so pediatric-specific guidelines should be followed rather than extrapolating adult cutoffs [^115nZtHj] [^111Rtjcv] [^111mAGMj] [^112uqQgQ].

> I will now synthesize the practical algorithm and key caveats, and I should double-check alignment with major societies. Start with FIB-4 in at-risk adults; if at least 1.3 or indeterminate, obtain VCTE and apply the NAFLD dual-cutoff strategy: below 8 kPa reassures against advanced fibrosis allowing management in primary care with metabolic risk reduction, 8–12 kPa prompts alternative NITs or biopsy based on uncertainty and treatment stakes, and above 12 kPa supports advanced fibrosis and specialist referral for staging, surveillance, and potential pharmacotherapy; always interpret LSM with awareness of modifiers and use MRE when VCTE accuracy is compromised, recognizing that TE excels as a rule-out test with high NPV while PPV is modest and shared decision-making is needed in the gray zone [^111EWoPD] [^112GE5SM] [^113snANe].

---

FibroScan is recommended for **risk stratification** in fatty liver disease [^115ZNXX8], especially in patients with T2DM [^114xw7u8], obesity [^1173p2jy], or metabolic syndrome. Use a **two-step approach**, starting with FIB-4 [^116ochts], then performing FibroScan if FIB-4 is indeterminate or high [^111EWoPD]. For NAFLD, LSM < 8 kPa rules out **advanced fibrosis**, 8–12 kPa is indeterminate, and > 12 kPa suggests advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis [^113snANe]. Repeat FibroScan every 1–3 years based on risk and clinical changes [^113DtiLm] [^notfound]. Interpret results in context, as obesity, inflammation, and alcohol can affect accuracy; use MRE or biopsy if results are inconclusive or discordant [^111g7uQY] [^113DtiLm].

---

## Indications for fibroscan in fatty liver disease

FibroScan is indicated for **risk stratification** in fatty liver disease, especially in patients with metabolic risk factors:

- **T2DM**: Even with normal liver enzymes [^111EWoPD] [^112wYGNz].
- **Obesity/metabolic syndrome**: Especially with abnormal LFTs or imaging steatosis [^115ZNXX8] [^1173p2jy].
- **Abnormal LFTs**: Persistent elevation > 6 months [^111GjRGP] [^114xw7u8].
- **High-risk groups**: T1DM with obesity/metabolic syndrome, elevated aminotransferases, or imaging steatosis [^111vGuZy] [^111mAGMj].

---

## Recommended clinical pathway for fibrosis assessment

A **two-step approach** is recommended for fibrosis assessment in fatty liver disease [^116ochts]. Step 1 uses **FIB-4** or the NAFLD fibrosis score to stratify risk [^111EWoPD]. Step 2 entails performing **FibroScan** when FIB-4 is indeterminate or high to clarify fibrosis stage [^113DtiLm]. This pathway improves accuracy and reduces unnecessary referrals [^114WCTNs].

---

## Fibroscan cutoff values for fibrosis staging

FibroScan uses **LSM** to stage fibrosis in NAFLD:

| **Fibrosis stage** | **LSM (kPa)** | **Clinical interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| F0–F1 | < 8 | No/mild fibrosis |
| F2 | 8–10 | Significant fibrosis |
| F3 | 10–12 | Advanced fibrosis |
| F4 | > 12 | Cirrhosis |

---

A **dual-cutoff strategy** is recommended: use < 8 kPa to rule out advanced fibrosis and > 12 kPa to rule in advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis [^113snANe].

---

## Frequency of fibroscan monitoring

FibroScan monitoring should be **individualized** by risk and clinical context: reassess low-risk patients every 2–3 years, intermediate-risk patients every 1–2 years, and high-risk patients annually or as clinically indicated [^113DtiLm]. Repeat testing is recommended with significant clinical changes or new risk factors [^114zBqfj].

---

## Limitations and contraindications

Key **limitations and contraindications** include:

- **Obesity**: May reduce accuracy; consider XL probe or MRE [^111g7uQY] [^113SitcU].
- **Inflammation**: Elevated ALT can overestimate stiffness.
- **Alcohol**: Recent intake can affect results [^113QFrqt].
- **Ascites**: Contraindicated due to unreliable measurements.
- **Pregnancy**: Generally avoided due to limited data.

---

## Integration with other noninvasive tests

FibroScan should be **combined with other noninvasive tests** for comprehensive assessment: use FIB-4 or APRI for initial risk stratification [^112wYGNz]. If FIB-4 is indeterminate, the ELF test is an appropriate second-line option [^113DtiLm] [^1126AcTQ], and consider MRE when FibroScan accuracy is compromised [^111g7uQY] [^113SitcU].

---

## Clinical decision-making based on fibroscan results

FibroScan results **guide clinical decisions**:

- **LSM < 8 kPa**: Low risk; manage in primary care with lifestyle and cardiovascular risk reduction [^113snANe].
- **LSM 8–12 kPa**: Indeterminate; refer to hepatology for further evaluation [^1144DwWB].
- **LSM > 12 kPa**: High risk; refer for specialist management, surveillance, and possible biopsy [^115Sxiis].

---

## Follow-up and management strategies

Follow-up and management **depend on fibrosis stage**: manage low-risk patients with lifestyle modification, weight loss, cardiovascular risk reduction, and periodic monitoring [^114Maziq]; refer intermediate-risk patients for further testing and targeted interventions; and for high-risk patients, provide specialist management, surveillance for complications, and consider pharmacotherapy or clinical trial enrollment [^111vEgcd].

---

FibroScan is a **noninvasive tool** for assessing fibrosis in fatty liver disease, and a two-step approach with FIB-4 followed by FibroScan is recommended [^116ochts]. Results should be interpreted in context [^113biJp8], and management should be individualized based on fibrosis stage and risk factors.

Transient elastography (TE) is more effective at ruling out than ruling in advanced fibrosis. For instance, at a cutoff value of 8 kPa, TE demonstrates a negative predictive value (NPV) and sensitivities greater than 90% but suboptimal positive predictive value (PPV) and specificities (less than 70%), leading to false-positive results in 30% to 40% of cases. The high NPV of TE is particularly important in aiding primary care providers (PCPs) to identify patients who do not require specialty referral.

- **Negative predictive value with TE**: The NPV is superior to the PPV for TE.

A dual cutoff strategy, with a lower cutoff maximizing sensitivity and a higher cutoff maximizing specificity, has been refined recently for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In a large individual-patient meta-analysis based on real-world data involving 5,648 patients with chronic liver disease, an 8 kPa cutoff provided 93% sensitivity to rule out advanced fibrosis, while a 12 kPa cutoff offered 88% specificity for confirming advanced fibrosis in patients with NAFLD (n = 1073). However, this approach results in a significant number of unclassified patients (25% to 30%) falling between the two cutoffs, necessitating a liver biopsy. In actual practice, the commonly used inflection point for considering a liver biopsy by the panelists is 8.0 to 8.5 kPa; however, decisions should be individualized based on factors such as diagnostic uncertainty (e.g. the need to exclude alternative liver diseases) or consideration of pharmacological treatment, including potential enrollment in clinical trials.

Non-invasive liver fibrosis assessment:

Patients with NAFLD should undergo sequential use of a simple non-invasive test (e.g. FIB-4) and specialist non-invasive tests (e.g. ELF, transient elastography, or ARFI) to assess the severity of fibrosis. Ideally, an initial fibrosis assessment should have been undertaken in primary care, and patients with suspected advanced fibrosis referred into secondary care, as they have the greatest risk of hepatic morbidity.

In secondary care, fibrosis stage should be confirmed, or second-line testing conducted with more specialist tests in individuals where simple non-invasive tests are indeterminate. The performance of biomarkers may be influenced by the prevalence of the target condition in the population being assessed, so clinicians should consider the likely disease prevalence in their practice setting and adopt suitable test thresholds to achieve the desired performance.

In general, use of simple non-invasive tests excludes the majority of cases with mild fibrosis. Addition of a second-line test (e.g. ELF, transient elastography, or ARFI) further reduces the number of cases with an indeterminate score, allowing liver biopsy to be reserved for use in a minority of patients where it adds additional useful information. Such two-stage care pathways are currently considered to provide the most robust means for the risk-stratification of patients with NAFLD.

Ongoing regular non-invasive fibrosis reassessment should be considered every 1–3 years to monitor response to treatment or for fibrosis progression.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for liver cirrhosis, specifically in the evaluation of fibrosis, the AASLD 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining either ultrasound-based elastography or magnetic resonance elastography to stage fibrosis in adult patients with chronic liver disease. Magnetic resonance elastography should be considered depending on local availability and expertise, particularly when concomitant cross-sectional imaging is required or if the accuracy of ultrasound-based elastography might be compromised.

The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Identification of people with NAFLD is crucial. The use of defined pathways for investigating suspected liver disease has been shown to increase the diagnosis of significant liver disease and reduce unnecessary referrals, thus services should have an agreed local clinical pathway for investigating suspected liver disease that includes an assessment for liver fibrosis using available non-invasive liver fibrosis tests. Key aspects to consider when developing pathways are described below.

NAFLD is considered the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, which is defined as any three of the following: impaired fasting glucose or T2DM, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL, increased waist circumference, or high blood pressure. NAFLD is highly prevalent in individuals with T2DM or metabolic syndrome, and the presence of these risk factors is associated with more progressive liver disease in NAFLD. Therefore, it is recommended to consider the possibility of liver fibrosis due to NAFLD in individuals with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) or metabolic syndrome.

Proactive assessment for the presence of liver fibrosis in patients at risk can allow for earlier identification of significant liver disease. The 'Scarred Liver Project', which offered community fibrosis testing to individuals with diabetes or obesity alongside those with hazardous alcohol consumption, identified 3,688 patients at risk from a cohort of 25,018. Overall, 20% of at-risk individuals who attended a follow-up clinic had evidence of significant liver disease.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, particularly concerning the noninvasive assessment of fibrosis, the EASL/EASD/EASO 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining noninvasive assessments, including blood biomarker-based scores and elastography. These assessments help predict the risk of overall and liver-related events and mortality in adult patients with MASLD.

---

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^1126AcTQ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Of note, recent guidance by NICE on NAFLD proposed single testing with serum ELF measurements without recourse to algorithms or other diagnostic modalities, based on cost-effectiveness analyses. This recommendation was noted and carefully considered during the drafting of this guideline. On balance, however, it was felt that the evidence for diagnostic tests, and their use in combination in NAFLD, was still evolving. Thus, this guidance took a broader view, setting out a pathway structure with a range of options. This view is endorsed by the EASL-ALEH guidelines for the non-invasive assessment of liver disease.

- **Recommendation 7**: Adults with NAFLD should undergo risk stratification to determine their extent of liver fibrosis.
	- First-line testing should use either FIB-4 or NAFLD Fibrosis Score (see Table 3). Calculation facilities for FIB-4 and NFS should be incorporated in all primary care computer systems (level 5, grade D).
	- Second-line testing requires a quantitative assessment of fibrosis with tests such as serum ELF measurements or Fibroscan/ARFI elastography (level 2b, grade B).

We recommend that hepatologists at a local level champion this idea and discuss it with commissioners of health to deal with the burden of liver disease in their area.

- **ARLD**:
	- Alcohol-related cirrhosis is the most common cause of liver-related mortality in Western populations. The majority of patients with this condition are heavy daily drinkers, with a median alcohol consumption of around 120 units/week. Notably, 25% of the population drink more than this amount.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^115ZNXX8]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

In screening and diagnosis for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, specifically concerning indications for screening in adult patients, the AASLD 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining screening for advanced fibrosis in patients at high risk. These high-risk groups include individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), medically complicated obesity, a family history of cirrhosis, or those who consume more than a mild amount of alcohol.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group [^111GjRGP]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

An increasing body of evidence has demonstrated advancing liver fibrosis as the key predictor of liver-related events and mortality in patients with NAFLD. Patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis (equivalent to Brunt fibrosis stage 3 or 4) are at increased risk of complications of chronic liver disease, decompensation, liver transplantation, and death in the short- to medium-term.

Since liver blood tests and ultrasound poorly discriminate fibrosis stage, primary care pathways for patients with NAFLD should assess for the presence of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis using validated non-invasive fibrosis tests. Accordingly, we suggest that the finding of liver steatosis on ultrasound, or unexplained abnormal liver blood tests, should prompt risk assessment for liver fibrosis. Use validated widely available non-invasive tests with high negative predictive value to risk assess for significant liver fibrosis in the community. Refer patients stratified as high risk for advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis to a hepatologist. For patients stratified as indeterminate risk, offer further discriminatory tests (such as transient elastography or ELF test) or refer for further evaluation.

Indirect biomarkers of liver fibrosis such as FIB-4 and NAFLD Fibrosis scores have been shown to have prognostic value for long-term outcomes and are validated against liver biopsy with good negative predictive value to rule out advanced liver fibrosis in NAFLD.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group [^114zBqfj]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Recommendations should be made on triggers for re-referral back to secondary care liver services for those discharged to primary care (Recommendation 33, Table 1) because a baseline assessment cannot adequately exclude the future possibility of fibrosis progression and liver-related outcomes. Patients might accumulate further risk factors and metabolic comorbidities over time. There is also the possibility of a false negative baseline fibrosis assessment leading to inappropriate patient discharge to primary care. Therefore, systems should be in place for the re-evaluation of fibrosis in patients with NAFLD discharged to primary care. The method of fibrosis assessment should be based on local availability and expertise, and some patients may require specific follow-up recommendations. For example, it would be inappropriate to use the FIB-4 score to follow-up a patient with non-liver related thrombocytopenia, as this could lead to a false positive result. Moreover, it may be appropriate to suggest no further fibrosis assessments in patients with significant comorbidities or frailty where management of liver disease would not alter their long-term outcomes.

Other potential triggers for re-referral might include a significant increase in serum liver enzyme values and/or laboratory indicators of advanced chronic liver disease, such as decreasing albumin, increased prothrombin time, and increased bilirubin. Furthermore, the development of T2DM should prompt a fibrosis reassessment because this has been shown to impact liver health significantly.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113ySWPf]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

For patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or liver disease of unknown etiology, the next step is to determine the likelihood of liver fibrosis. Initial assessment includes the calculation of a FIB-4 or NAFLD fibrosis score. Values less than 1.3 and less than or equal to 1.455, respectively, indicate a low risk of advanced fibrosis. Higher cut-off points of less than 2.0 and less than 0.12 should be used for patients over 65 years of age.

- **Second-line tests**: Consider serum markers such as enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) and imaging modalities such as acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography or FibroScan. For children, consult the text for modification of recommendations.

- **Device-specific considerations**: Cut-off points for ARFI vary according to the manufacturer and should be tailored to the device used.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group [^117YVd4r]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Exemplar pathways exist as recently reviewed. The Camden and Islington NAFLD pathway stratified fibrosis in over 1,450 patients with NAFLD over two years using FIB-4 in all patients and the ELF test in FIB-4 indeterminate cases. Patients identified as high-risk for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were reassessed in secondary care, resulting in a 5-fold increase in detection of advanced fibrosis, a 3-fold increase in the detection of cirrhosis, and an 81% reduction in referrals of patients with mild disease in comparison to the absence of any defined care pathway.

A number of cost-effectiveness studies have demonstrated the benefit of such risk stratification strategies. The use of serum markers and elastography, either alone or in combination, has been shown to be clinically effective and cost-saving compared to standard care.

Patients stratified as high risk for advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, whose liver disease is not outweighed by comorbidities or performance status, should be referred to a hepatologist or gastroenterologist with an interest in liver disease for further evaluation of their condition.

For patients stratified as indeterminate risk for advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis using simple non-invasive tests (NIT), the result is neither sensitive nor specific enough to confidently rule in or rule out advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. A second-tier liver fibrosis test, such as a direct collagen biomarker (e.g. ELF) or elastography (e.g. transient elastography), should be offered. Although the optimum pathway has not yet been determined, liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography is recommended for further assessment.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117CHg7V]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

In the approach to common conditions, particularly NAFLD:

NAFLD is diagnosed by the presence of an echobright liver on ultrasound, in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption. For adults with NAFLD, it is recommended that a first-line, non-invasive assessment, such as Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) or NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS), be undertaken to identify patients with advanced fibrosis. Patients with a low FIB-4 (< 1.3 for those under 65 years or 1.3–3.25 for those over 65 years), or low NFS (−1.455 to -0.675), can be managed in primary care. Presently, the mainstay of treatment for NAFLD is to reduce calorie intake and increase physical activity with the aim of inducing gradual and long-term weight loss.

Those patients with indeterminate FIB-4 (1.3–3.25) or NFS scores (−1.455 to 0.675) should undergo further testing with a second-line test, such as serum enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) or Fibroscan/acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography. The decision to use Fibroscan or ARFI should be based on local expertise and availability of respective devices. Consider referral to a specialist clinic for patients with serum ELF measurements > 9.5 or Fibroscan > 7.8 kPa. Cut-off points for ARFI vary according to the manufacturer and thus should be tailored to the device used.

Finally, those patients with elevated FIB-4 (> 3.25) or NFS (> 0.675) should be considered for referral to a specialist clinic irrespective of second-line tests. Non-invasive markers of fibrosis should be used to guide the management of patients with NAFLD effectively.

### Fibroscan (vibration-controlled transient elastography): Where does it stand in the United States practice [^114AZpCk]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

With widespread screening and increasingly effective treatments for patients with viral hepatitis, as well as the increasing prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the population presenting to the care of gastroenterologists and hepatologists is certain to increase. Assessment of advanced liver disease is traditionally invasive and expensive. Vibration-controlled transient elastography, commonly delivered by the Fibroscan device, is an option recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the noninvasive assessment of liver disease at the point of care. Herein, we review the promise and pitfalls of vibration-controlled transient elastography with the aim of providing clinicians with a framework to interpret its results and apply this technology to the changing needs of our patients.

### AASLD practice guideline on imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis [^112Ad9TX]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for liver cirrhosis, particularly in the evaluation of fibrosis and hepatitis B, the AASLD 2025 guidelines recommend considering the use of liver stiffness measurement obtained before initiating antiviral therapy. This measurement is considered the most accurate longitudinal noninvasive liver disease assessment parameter for prognostication. This recommendation is based on the limited amount of evidence associating liver stiffness measurement with clinical outcomes once viral suppression or eradication is achieved in patients with treated HBV infection.

### Update on the role of elastography in liver disease [^112ScMf2]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of liver fibrosis and the assessment of its severity are important to provide appropriate management and to determine the prognosis or the need for surveillance. Currently, for fibrosis staging, liver stiffness measurement (LSM) with shear wave elastography (SWE) techniques is considered a reliable substitute for liver biopsy in several clinical scenarios. Nonetheless, it should be emphasized that stiffness value is a biomarker of diffuse liver disease that must be interpreted considering anamnesis, clinical, and laboratory data.

In patients with diffuse liver disease, it is more clinically relevant to determine the likelihood of advanced disease rather than to obtain an exact stage of liver fibrosis using a histologic classification. In this regard, a 'rule of five' for LSMs with vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) and a 'rule of four' for LSMs with acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI)-based techniques have been proposed.

For patients with advanced chronic liver disease (CLD), the risk of liver decompensation increases with increasing liver stiffness value. SWE has been proposed as a tool to predict the risk of death or complications in patients with CLD. LSM by VCTE combined with platelet count is a validated non-invasive method for varices screening, achieving very good results in terms of sparing invasive procedures. ARFI-based techniques also show some promising results in this setting. LSM, alone or combined in scores or algorithms with other parameters, is used to evaluate the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence.

### AGA clinical practice update: Diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in lean individuals: Expert review [^111Rtjcv]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is well recognized as a leading etiology for chronic liver disease, affecting over 25% of the US and global populations. Up to 1 in 4 individuals with NAFLD have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to complications of liver cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although NAFLD is observed predominantly in persons with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus, an estimated 7%-20% of individuals with NAFLD have lean body habitus.

Limited guidance is available to clinicians on appropriate clinical evaluation in lean individuals with NAFLD, such as for inherited/genetic disorders, lipodystrophy, drug-induced NAFLD, and inflammatory disorders. Emerging data now provides more robust evidence to define the epidemiology, natural history, prognosis, and mortality of lean individuals with NAFLD. Multiple studies have found that NAFLD among lean individuals is associated with increased cardiovascular, liver, and all-cause mortality relative to those without NAFLD. This American Gastroenterological Association Clinical Practice Update provides Best Practice Advice to assist clinicians in evidence-based approaches to the diagnosis, staging, and management of NAFLD in lean individuals.

The expert review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD special interest group [^111vEgcd]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) who are at risk for the development of liver-related complications, including those with cirrhosis and significant-advanced fibrosis, should be managed in a secondary care setting, similar to those with other etiologies. Regular surveillance of patients with cirrhosis using 6-monthly ultrasounds is one of the quality standards laid down by NICE. This allows for early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and prompt treatment, which can improve survival. Additionally, regular monitoring enables early detection and treatment of liver-related complications such as ascites, varices, and hepatic encephalopathy. It also facilitates appropriate referrals for liver transplantation once clinical thresholds are met. The management process should be individualized, particularly for those with significant comorbidities and poor performance status, who may be counseled against active monitoring.

Individuals with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) exhibiting significant (F2), advanced fibrosis (F3), or cirrhosis (F4) are at risk of progression to end-stage liver disease and potential complications in the medium to long term. Therefore, secondary care follow-up may be appropriate for these individuals, including consideration for specific treatment for NASH or investigational drugs. Accordingly, it is suggested that people with NAFLD at significantly increased risk of disease progression and potential liver-related complications continue to be managed in a secondary care setting. Such patients include those with cirrhosis or significant-advanced fibrosis.

### Fibroscan versus simple noninvasive screening tools in predicting fibrosis in high-risk nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients from Western India [^117FKe4F]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to determine the efficacy of Fibroscan versus noninvasive markers, i.e. nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) fibrosis score (NFS); aspartate-aminotransferase (AST)/platelet ratio (APRI); and AST/alanine-aminotransferase (AAR) as screening tools in NAFLD patients with a high risk of liver fibrosis.

- **Methods**: This single-center study was carried out in patients attending the outpatient department for dyspepsia and diagnosed with fatty liver via ultrasound. A liver biopsy was advised for diabetics, those with metabolic syndrome, a body mass index > 30 kg/m², raised transaminases, and hypothyroidism. Fibroscan, APRI, AAR, and NFS were calculated. Area under the curve (AUROC), negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated for each diagnostic test.

- **Results**: Of the 1500 patients screened, 110 with the described risk factors underwent liver biopsy (stage 3/4 fibrosis = 38). Diabetes predicted severe fibrosis (stage 3/4). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and AUROC for Fibroscan at value 12 kPa were 0.9, 0.8, 0.70, 0.93, and 0.91, respectively, for predicting stage 3/4 fibrosis. With increased severity of liver fibrosis, there was a stepwise increase in Fibroscan values (P = 0.000038, Kruskal-Wallis test). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for AAR and NFS at cutoffs of 1.5 and 0.676 were 0.8, 1.0, 1.0, and 0.92, and 0.8, 1.0, 1.0, and 0.92, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: Fibroscan, NFS, and AAR are simple noninvasive markers of fibrosis that can be utilized as screening tools in patients with a high risk for fibrosis to determine the need for further intervention.

### Noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: Present and future [^111TukCw]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in the United States, and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. It currently affects approximately 30% of adults and 10% of children in the United States. NAFLD represents a wide spectrum of conditions ranging from simple fatty liver, which in general follows a benign nonprogressive clinical course, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is a more serious form of NAFLD that may progress to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease.

At present, a liver biopsy remains the only reliable way to diagnose NASH and establish the presence of fibrosis. Noninvasive clinically available tests lack accuracy and reliability. In light of the dramatic increase in the prevalence of NAFLD in conjunction with the significant research effort in developing novel therapies for patients with NASH, noninvasive, simple, reproducible, and reliable biomarkers are greatly needed. They will not only help in the diagnosis of NASH but also be useful for assessment of treatment response and prognosis, and remain a research priority in the NAFLD field.

### Practice patterns in NAFLD and NASH: Real life differs from published guidelines [^114PMC6X]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Management guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, American College of Gastroenterology, and American Gastroenterology Association published in 2012 for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) recommend weight loss, vitamin E, and pioglitazone as effective therapies for the treatment of biopsy-confirmed NASH. However, little is known about how physicians in the US diagnose NASH or whether published guidelines are being followed.

- **Methods**: We assessed diagnostic and treatment patterns of the management of NAFLD and NASH among academic gastroenterologists and hepatologists in the US using a standardized survey developed to collect information regarding respondents' practice environments, diagnostic techniques, and medication usage in patients with NAFLD/NASH.

- **Results**: We invited 482 gastroenterologists and hepatologists, predominantly from academic centers, of whom 163 completed the survey. Only 24% of providers routinely perform liver biopsies, predominantly among patients with elevated serum aminotransferases. Vitamin E is prescribed regularly by 70%, while only 14% routinely prescribe pioglitazone. Despite recommendations to the contrary, approximately 25% prescribe pioglitazone or vitamin E without biopsy confirmation of NASH. Metformin is used as frequently as pioglitazone despite its proven lack of efficacy in NASH. Overall, 40–73% adhere to published guidelines, depending on the specific question. There was no significant difference seen in adherence to guidelines between gastroenterologists and hepatologists.

### AGA clinical practice update on the role of noninvasive biomarkers in the evaluation and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: Expert review [^112xzfAq]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Clinical Practice Update Expert Review is to provide clinicians with guidance on the use of noninvasive tests (NITs) in the evaluation and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD affects nearly 30% of the global population and is a growing cause of end-stage liver disease and liver-related healthcare resource utilization. However, only a minority of all patients with NAFLD experience a liver-related outcome.

It is therefore critically important for clinicians to assess prognosis and identify those with increased risk of disease progression and negative clinical outcomes at the time of initial assessment. It is equally important to assess disease trajectory over time, particularly in response to currently available therapeutic approaches. The reference standard for assessment of prognosis and disease monitoring is histologic examination of liver biopsy specimens. There are, however, many limitations of liver biopsies and their reading that have limited their use in routine practice.

The utilization of NITs facilitates risk stratification of patients and longitudinal assessment of disease progression for patients with NAFLD. This clinical update provides best practice advice based on a review of the literature on the utilization of NITs in the management of NAFLD for clinicians. Accordingly, a combination of available evidence and consensus-based expert opinion, without formal rating of the strength and quality of the evidence, was used to develop these best practices.

### Degree of discordance between FIB-4 and transient elastography: An application of current guidelines on general population cohort [^113NY8R4]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Aims**: In the American Gastroenterological Association/American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AGA/AASLD) Clinical Care Pathway, the Fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) is used to stratify patients at risk for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) as low, indeterminate, or high risk for developing advanced liver fibrosis. We assessed the performance of FIB-4 in a general population.

- **Methods**: Using the 2017 to 2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys dataset, we selected subjects aged ≥ 18 years who had FibroScan data. We followed AGA/AASLD guidelines to identify subjects with characteristics that place them at risk for MASLD-associated liver fibrosis. Other causes of liver disease were excluded. Our final cohort comprised 3,741 subjects. We then categorized these subjects based on recommended FIB-4 cutoffs. FibroScan liver stiffness measurement (LSM) served as the outcome measurement.

- **Results**: Among the 2,776 subjects (74.2%) classified as low risk by FIB-4, 277 subjects (10%) were not classified at low risk by LSM, and 75 subjects (2.7%) were classified as high risk by LSM. Among the 86 subjects classified as high risk by FIB-4, 68 subjects (79.1%) were not at high risk by LSM, and 54 subjects (62.8%) were at low risk by LSM. Subjects misclassified by FIB-4 as low risk were older and had a higher body mass index, waist circumference, glycohemoglobin A1c level, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, diastolic blood pressure, controlled attenuation parameter score, white blood cell count, alkaline phosphatase, and fasting glucose.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group [^114Maziq]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Ideally, second-stage non-invasive testing should be delivered in the community to reduce the unnecessary referral to secondary care for some individuals with a false positive simple NIT. However, where these services are not available in the community, patients should be referred to secondary services for further workup.

The overwhelming majority of liver-related complications in patients with NAFLD occur in those with cirrhosis. NITs have high negative predictive values for advanced fibrosis, so they can reliably exclude the presence of cirrhosis. Moreover, long-term follow-up studies have shown that patients with low-risk NITs have a very low risk of liver-related events in the short- to medium-term, and their main morbidity is cardiovascular disease and non-hepatic malignancy. One recent long-term follow-up study of 1,057 patients showed that individuals with NAFLD and a FIB-4 score < 1.3 had a very low incidence rate for liver-related events of 2.6 per 1,000 patient-years. Therefore, for these patients, the focus should be on lifestyle advice and cardiovascular risk reduction, with the aim of improving their overall quality and length of life.

NAFLD can progress to advanced fibrosis in a significant proportion of patients in the medium-term, particularly those with, or who develop, T2DM and those who gain weight. Therefore, individuals with these risk factors should be targeted for more proactive lifestyle modification, optimization of treatment for T2DM, and cardiovascular risk reduction. Accordingly, manage those at low risk.

### Expert panel consensus on clinical assertion statements describing noninvasive tools for diagnosing nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^114jBjVv]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

An algorithm for fibrosis assessment and monitoring is based on the discussion of the Clinical Assertion Statements. ELF indicates Enhanced Liver Fibrosis Test; FAST, FibroScan-AST; FIB-4, Fibrosis-4; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NAFLD, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; NIT, noninvasive test; NFS, NAFLD Fibrosis Score; T2D, type 2 diabetes; TE, transient elastography.

- **Statement 5**: In patients with NAFLD and metabolic risks, presence of hepatic fibrosis should be considered regardless of level of transaminase elevation. This statement targets primary care providers (PCPs), who often do not consider the risk of hepatic fibrosis in patients with NAFLD and metabolic risk factors, particularly in those with normal transaminases. "Consideration of hepatic fibrosis" may include diagnostic efforts and interventions or eventual referral to a specialist.

The statement may challenge deep-rooted PCP-referral patterns that rely heavily on transaminase elevation. Emerging literature suggests that an approach based on transaminase elevation will likely miss many patients with NASH and clinically significant fibrosis (≥ F2) — stages that correlate with adverse liver outcomes.

While organizations' guidelines agree that patients with NAFLD, cardiometabolic risk factors, and elevated transaminases should be evaluated for hepatic fibrosis, disagreement exists on how to proceed if transaminases are "normal" in the presence of the other two variables. Various guidelines recommend for, and against, routine screening for NAFLD in high-risk groups. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends…

### The diagnostic utility of fibrosis-4 or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score combined with liver stiffness measurement by fibroscan in assessment of advanced liver fibrosis: a biopsy-proven nonalcoholic fatty liver disease study [^1144DwWB]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

The clinical guidelines recommend the use of the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score and fibrosis-4 score for estimating advanced liver fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However, these scores are more confidently used to exclude advanced fibrosis rather than detect it. Therefore, a paired combination with liver stiffness measurement by transient elastography is recommended. In this study, we aimed to validate this combined algorithm in our study population.

A total of 139 consecutive biopsy-proven nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients were enrolled in the study. We calculated the noninvasive scores and performed liver stiffness measurement examinations for each patient.

The optimal cutoff for liver stiffness measurement in diagnosing advanced fibrosis was 11.0 kPa (area under the curve: 0.856) with a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 78%. Using the fibrosis-4 score (3.25 for high risk of advanced fibrosis) in combination with the liver stiffness measurement cutoffs revealed the best diagnostic performance (10.9 kPa for high risk of advanced fibrosis). This paired combination had a positive predictive value of 0.735 at a sensitivity of 89% and a negative predictive value of 0.932 at a specificity of 82%.

A paired combination of the fibrosis-4 score and liver stiffness measurement (10.9 kPa for inclusion of advanced fibrosis) is able to diagnose the patients with advanced fibrosis effectively.

### Update on the role of elastography in liver disease [^11619LYs]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of liver fibrosis and the assessment of its severity are important to provide appropriate management and to determine the prognosis or the need for surveillance. Currently, for fibrosis staging, liver stiffness measurement (LSM) with shear wave elastography (SWE) techniques is considered a reliable substitute for liver biopsy in several clinical scenarios. Nonetheless, it should be emphasized that stiffness value is a biomarker of diffuse liver disease and must be interpreted by considering anamnesis, clinical, and laboratory data.

In patients with diffuse liver disease, it is more clinically relevant to determine the likelihood of advanced disease rather than to obtain an exact stage of liver fibrosis using a histologic classification. In this regard, a "rule of five" for LSMs with vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) and a "rule of four" for LSMs with acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI)-based techniques have been proposed. In patients with advanced chronic liver disease (CLD), the risk of liver decompensation increases with increasing liver stiffness value. SWE has been proposed as a tool to predict the risk of death or complications in patients with CLD.

LSM by VCTE combined with platelet count is a validated non-invasive method for varices screening, with very good results in terms of invasive procedures being spared. ARFI-based techniques also show some promising results in this setting. LSM, whether alone or combined in scores or algorithms with other parameters, is used to evaluate the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group [^1141fY4d]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common, affecting approximately 25% of the general population. The evidence base for the investigation and management of NAFLD is large and growing, but there is currently little practical guidance to support the development of services and delivery of care. To address this, we produced a series of evidence-based quality standard recommendations for the management of NAFLD, with the aim of improving patient care.

A multidisciplinary group of experts from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group produced the recommendations, which cover:

- **Management of people with, or at risk of, NAFLD before the gastroenterology or liver clinic**: Assessment and investigations in secondary care; and management in secondary care.

The quality of evidence for each recommendation was evaluated by the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool. An anonymous modified Delphi voting process was conducted individually by each member of the group to assess the level of agreement with each statement. Statements were included when agreement was 80% or greater.

From the final list of statements, a smaller number of auditable key performance indicators were selected to allow services to benchmark their practice. It is hoped that services will review their practice against our recommendations and key performance indicators and institute service development where needed to improve the care of patients with NAFLD.

### Expert panel consensus on clinical assertion statements describing noninvasive tools for diagnosing nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^117Pi5QN]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

In response to the difficulties in using liver biopsy to confirm NASH, new data have shifted the focus toward NASH patients with stage 2 and higher fibrosis. These are stages that correlate with disease morbidity and mortality and potential candidacy for targeted therapies. The 2018 AASLD Guidance recommended that pharmacological therapy should be predicated upon the finding of F2 fibrosis or greater on liver biopsy.

Recent research has focused on identifying patients with NASH+NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) ≥ 4+ ≥ F2, primarily to replace biopsy, which is currently required for clinical trials. One promising NIT is the FibroScan-AST (FAST) score, which combines the controlled attenuation parameter score and stiffness assessed by TE with AST. In the derivative/validation cohorts study, the test performed well, with AUROC of ~0.80 and two author-determined cutoffs: the first (≤ 0.35) to rule out NASH+NAS ≥ 4+ ≥ F2 and the other (≥ 0.67) to rule in NASH+NAS ≥ 4+ ≥ F2. Greater than 30% of patients fell into the indeterminate zone. Nevertheless, the test is a promising alternative to liver biopsy for determining which NASH patients should be started on therapy.

### Fibroscan versus simple noninvasive screening tools in predicting fibrosis in high-risk nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients from Western India [^111YYCpn]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to determine the efficacy of Fibroscan versus noninvasive markers, such as the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) fibrosis score (NFS), aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/platelet ratio (APRI), and AST/alanine aminotransferase (AAR), as a screening tool in NAFLD patients with a high risk of liver fibrosis.

- **Methods**: This is a single-center study carried out in patients attending the outpatient department for dyspepsia and diagnosed with fatty liver on ultrasound. Liver biopsy was advised in cases of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, body mass index > 30 kg/m², raised transaminases, and hypothyroidism. Fibroscan, APRI, AAR, and NFS were calculated. The area under the curve (AUROC), negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated for each diagnostic test.

- **Results**: Of the 1500 patients screened, 110 with the above-described risk factors underwent liver biopsy (stage 3/4 fibrosis = 38). Diabetes predicted severe fibrosis (stage 3/4). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and AUROC for Fibroscan at value 12 kPa were 0.9, 0.8, 0.70, 0.93, and 0.91 respectively for predicting stage 3/4 fibrosis. With an increase in the severity of liver fibrosis, there was a stepwise increase in Fibroscan values (P = 0.000038, Kruskal-Wallis test). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for AAR and NFS at cutoffs of 1.5 and 0.676 were 0.8, 1.0, 1.0, and 0.92, and 0.8, 1.0, 1.0, and 0.92 respectively.

- **Conclusion**: Fibroscan, NFS, and AAR are simple noninvasive markers of fibrosis that can be utilized as screening tools in patients with a high risk for fibrosis, to determine the need for biopsies.
