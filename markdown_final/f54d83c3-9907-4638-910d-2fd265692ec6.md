## Question

15-year-old boy with acute asthma exacerbation during exercise, treated with supplemental oxygen and nebulized bronchodilator.

A 15-year-old boy with poorly controlled asthma presents to the emergency room complaining of severe shortness of breath. His mother reports that he had trouble breathing soon after he started playing soccer with some friends and was unable to use his inhaler as it was empty. His family history is notable for emphysema in his paternal uncle and cirrhosis in his maternal grandfather. The child’s temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, respirations are 28/min, and oxygen saturation is 91% on room air. Physical examination demonstrates wheezing bilaterally in all lung fields. The child is started on supplemental oxygen and a nebulized bronchodilator. Which of the following is a downstream effect of this medication?

Answer Choices:
A. Decreased leukotriene activity
B. Activation of muscarinic receptors
C. Decreased phosphodiesterase activity
D. Increased adenylate cyclase activity

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option correctly identifies a downstream effect of a nebulized bronchodilator used for an acute asthma exacerbation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what medication was actually given and its pharmacologic class. Then, I should verify the receptor and signaling pathway involved. Next, I will examine each answer choice against that mechanism. Finally, I will confirm the best answer and briefly note why the distractors are incorrect, anchoring to guideline-level sources where possible.

> Let me first confirm the medication and its class. The scenario states the child received a nebulized bronchodilator for acute asthma; in standard emergency care, that is a short-acting beta2-agonist such as albuterol/salbutamol, which acts on beta2-adrenergic receptors to produce bronchodilation [^9a672258] [^0c36d300].

> Now, I need to check the downstream signaling. Beta2-agonists bind beta2-receptors, which are Gs-protein coupled; this activates adenylate cyclase, increases intracellular cAMP, and leads to smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation, so increased adenylate cyclase activity is a direct downstream effect of SABA therapy [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review each option against this mechanism. Option A claims decreased leukotriene activity; that would reflect anti-leukotriene therapy (e.g., montelukast), not beta-agonists, so that is incorrect. Option B claims activation of muscarinic receptors; that would cause bronchoconstriction, the opposite of what we want, and is actually the target of anticholinergics like ipratropium, not SABAs, so that is wrong. Option C claims decreased phosphodiesterase activity; wait, let me verify — phosphodiesterase inhibition increases cAMP by slowing its breakdown, which is the mechanism of methylxanthines like theophylline, not beta-agonists, so that is not the SABA pathway. Option D claims increased adenylate cyclase activity, which matches the Gs-coupled beta2-receptor signaling cascade and is the correct downstream effect of SABA bronchodilation [^notfound].

> I should double-check that none of the distractors could plausibly fit a SABA. Leukotriene modifiers, muscarinic agonism, and phosphodiesterase inhibition are distinct classes with different mechanisms; guidelines and pharmacologic reviews consistently describe SABAs as acting via beta2-receptor–adenylate cyclase–cAMP signaling, reinforcing that D is the only mechanistically consistent choice here [^notfound].

> Final answer: D. Increased adenylate cyclase activity.

---

The correct answer is **D. Increased adenylate cyclase activity**. Nebulized bronchodilators in acute asthma are short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs) that activate β2-adrenergic receptors, which **signal through Gs proteins to increase adenylate cyclase**, raise cAMP, and relax airway smooth muscle [^notfound]. This is the direct downstream effect of SABA therapy. Options A, B, and C are incorrect: leukotriene activity is not targeted by SABAs, muscarinic receptors are antagonized (not activated) by anticholinergics, and phosphodiesterase activity is not decreased by SABAs.

---

## Pharmacological mechanism of nebulized bronchodilators

Nebulized bronchodilators for acute asthma are **short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs)** such as albuterol (salbutamol). They exert their therapeutic effect through the following mechanism:

- **β2-adrenergic receptor activation**: SABAs bind to β2-adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle cells, leading to receptor conformational change and activation of the associated Gs protein.

- **Gs protein signaling**: The activated Gs protein stimulates adenylate cyclase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).

- **cAMP-mediated relaxation**: Increased intracellular cAMP levels activate protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates proteins involved in calcium signaling, leading to reduced intracellular calcium concentrations and subsequent relaxation of airway smooth muscle.

- **Bronchodilation**: This relaxation results in dilation of the airways, reducing airway resistance and improving airflow, thereby alleviating symptoms of acute asthma exacerbation.

---

## Analysis of answer choices

### A. Decreased leukotriene activity

Leukotrienes are inflammatory mediators involved in asthma pathophysiology, and their activity is typically targeted by leukotriene receptor antagonists (e.g. montelukast). SABAs **do not directly affect leukotriene activity**; therefore, this option is incorrect.

---

### B. Activation of muscarinic receptors

Muscarinic receptors are cholinergic receptors that, when activated, cause bronchoconstriction. Anticholinergic medications such as ipratropium bromide are used in acute asthma to **antagonize muscarinic receptors**, thereby reducing bronchoconstriction. SABAs do not activate muscarinic receptors; thus, this option is incorrect.

---

### C. Decreased phosphodiesterase activity

Phosphodiesterase enzymes degrade cAMP, and their inhibition leads to increased cAMP levels and bronchodilation. Medications such as theophylline inhibit phosphodiesterase, but SABAs **do not directly inhibit phosphodiesterase activity**; therefore, this option is incorrect.

---

### D. Increased adenylate cyclase activity

As detailed above, SABAs activate β2-adrenergic receptors, which **signal through Gs proteins to increase adenylate cyclase activity**, raise cAMP, and cause bronchodilation. This is the correct downstream effect of nebulized bronchodilators in acute asthma.

---

## Clinical implications

Understanding the downstream effect of increased adenylate cyclase activity is clinically significant because it explains the rapid onset of action of SABAs in acute asthma exacerbations. This rapid bronchodilation provides immediate relief of symptoms, making SABAs the **first-line therapy** for acute asthma exacerbations [^9a672258].

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **D. Increased adenylate cyclase activity**. Nebulized bronchodilators in acute asthma exert their therapeutic effect by activating β2-adrenergic receptors, which increases adenylate cyclase activity, raises cAMP, and causes airway smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation.

### The patient with asthma in the emergency department [^422389a1]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is a highly prevalent disease that presents commonly to the emergency department (ED) in acute exacerbation. Recent asthma treatment guidelines have added content dedicated to the management of acute exacerbations. Effective management of an exacerbation requires rapid assessment of severity through physical examination, measurement of peak expiratory flow rate, and response to initial treatment. Most therapies are directed at alleviating bronchospasm and decreasing airway inflammation. While inhaled short-acting beta-agonists, systemic corticosteroids, and supplemental oxygen are the initial and often only therapies required for patients with mild moderate exacerbations, high-dose beta agonists and inhaled anti-cholinergics should also be given to patients with severe exacerbations. Adjunctive therapy with intravenous magnesium and Heliox-driven nebulization of bronchodilators should be considered for patients presenting with severe and very severe exacerbations. Early recognition and appropriate management of respiratory failure are required to mitigate the risk of complications including death. Disposition should be determined based on serial assessments of the response to therapy over the first 4 h in the ED. Patients stable for discharge should receive medications, asthma education including a written asthma action plan, and should have follow-up scheduled for them by ED staff. Rapid implementation of evidence-based, multi-disciplinary care is required to ensure the best possible outcomes for this potentially treatable disease.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^9a672258]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Treatment in acute care settings—inhaled short-acting beta2 agonists (SABA)—Currently, inhaled salbutamol (albuterol) is the usual bronchodilator in acute asthma management, and the most cost-effective and efficient delivery is by pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) with a spacer (Evidence A). Systematic reviews of intermittent versus continuous SABA in acute asthma provide conflicting results, use of nebulizers can disseminate aerosols and potentially contribute to spread of respiratory viral infections, and current evidence does not support the routine use of intravenous beta2 agonist in most patients with severe asthma exacerbations (Evidence A).

### Management of the acute exacerbation of asthma [^3172753b]. The Journal of Asthma (2003). Low credibility.

All patients with asthma are at risk of having asthma exacerbations characterized by worsening symptoms, airflow obstruction, and an increased requirement for rescue bronchodilators. The goals of managing an asthma exacerbation are prompt recognition and rapid reversal of airflow obstruction to avert relapses and future episodes. Short-acting beta-agonists, oxygen, and corticosteroids form the basis of management of acute asthma exacerbation, but a role is emerging for anticholinergics and newer agents such as levalbuterol and formoterol. Initiation or intensification of long-term controller therapy, treatment of comorbid conditions, avoidance of likely triggers, and timely follow-up care prevent setbacks. Acceptance of current treatment guidelines by physicians and adherence to the recommended clinical regimens by patients are essential for effective management of asthma. The physician should strive to establish a constructive relationship with the patient by addressing the patient's concerns, reaching agreement on the goals of therapy, and developing a written action plan for patient self-management.

### Continuous bronchodilator therapy [^f6135bcb]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Inhaled bronchodilators are first-line treatment for acute exacerbations of asthma. Continuous bronchodilator administration is a novel option for the treatment of bronchospasm, which may be more effective than intermittent therapy for patients with severe airflow obstruction. For 2007, coding and billing changes for this modality become effective. This article reviews clinical aspects and outpatient practice management of continuous bronchodilator therapy.

### Medication regimens for managing acute asthma [^6cc35765]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbation is defined as a progressive increase in symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, or wheezing sufficient to require a change in therapy. After ruling out diagnoses that mimic an asthma exacerbation, therapy should be initiated. Short-acting β 2 agonists and short-acting muscarinic antagonists are effective as bronchodilators for asthma in the acute setting. Systemic corticosteroids to reduce airway inflammation continue to be the mainstay therapy for asthma exacerbations, and, unless there is a contraindication, the oral route is favored. Based on the current evidence, nebulized magnesium should not be routinely used in acute asthma. The evidence favors the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate in selected cases, particularly in severe exacerbations. Methylxanthines have a minimum role as therapy for asthma exacerbations but may be considered in refractory cases of status asthmaticus with careful monitoring of toxicity. Current guidelines recommend the use of helium-oxygen mixtures in patients who do not respond to standard therapies or those with severe disease.

### Management of acute asthma exacerbations [^6b2ef94e]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbations can be classified as mild, moderate, severe, or life threatening. Criteria for exacerbation severity are based on symptoms and physical examination parameters, as well as lung function and oxygen saturation. In patients with a peak expiratory flow of 50 to 79 percent of their personal best, up to two treatments of two to six inhalations of short-acting beta2 agonists 20 minutes apart followed by a reassessment of peak expiratory flow and symptoms may be safely employed at home. Administration using a hand-held metered-dose inhaler with a spacer device is at least equivalent to nebulized beta2 agonist therapy in children and adults. In the ambulatory and emergency department settings, the goals of treatment are correction of severe hypoxemia, rapid reversal of airflow obstruction, and reduction of the risk of relapse. Multiple doses of inhaled anticholinergic medication combined with beta2 agonists improve lung function and decrease hospitalization in school-age children with severe asthma exacerbations. Intravenous magnesium sulfate has been shown to significantly increase lung function and decrease the necessity of hospitalization in children. The administration of systemic corticosteroids within one hour of emergency department presentation decreases the need for hospitalization, with the most pronounced effect in patients with severe exacerbations. Airway inflammation can persist for days to weeks after an acute attack; therefore, more intensive treatment should be continued after discharge until symptoms and peak expiratory flow return to baseline.

### Inhaled budesonide in the management of acute worsenings and exacerbations of asthma: a review of the evidence [^6801914c]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The use of systemic corticosteroids, together with bronchodilators and oxygen therapy, has become established for the management of acute asthma. These agents are undoubtedly effective, but are also associated with problems such as metabolic adverse effects. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) offer potential benefit in the acute setting because they are delivered directly to the airways. They are also likely to reduce systemic exposure, which would lead in turn to reductions in rates of unwanted systemic effects. In order to evaluate the role of budesonide in the management of acute asthma exacerbations we conducted a review of the literature and critically evaluated the rationale for the use of ICS in general in this setting. Trials in adults and children requiring treatment for acute exacerbation of asthma have shown clinical and/or spirometric benefit for budesonide when delivered via nebulizer, dry powder inhaler, or aerosol in the emergency department, hospital and follow-up settings. The efficacy seems to benefit from high doses given repeatedly during the initial phase of an acute exacerbation. These acute effects are likely to be linked to the drug's distinctive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. The current evidence base revealed encouraging results regarding the efficacy of the ICS budesonide in patients with wheeze and acute worsening of asthma. Future studies should focus on the efficacy of these agents in more severe asthma worsenings.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^f935fed1]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Emergency treatment and initial pharmacotherapy—inhaled bronchodilator therapy states the initial dose of inhaled short-acting beta agonist (SABA) may be given by a pMDI with spacer and mask or mouthpiece or an air-driven nebulizer, or, if oxygen saturation is low, by an oxygen-driven nebulizer. For most children, pMDI plus spacer is favored as it is more efficient than a nebulizer for bronchodilator delivery (Evidence A), and nebulizers can spread infectious particles. The initial dose is two puffs of salbutamol (100 mcg per puff) or equivalent, except in acute, severe asthma when six puffs should be given; when a nebulizer is used, a dose of 2.5 mg salbutamol solution is recommended, with dosing frequency based on response observed over 1–2 hours. For children with moderate-severe exacerbations and a poor response to initial SABA, nebulized ipratropium bromide may be added every 20 minutes for 1 hour only.

### Best practice advice for asthma exacerbation prevention and management in primary care: an international expert consensus [^c5779c56]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The physiologic rationale for ICS use with bronchodilation to manage exacerbations is related to the more rapid nongenomic effects of ICS, which may not be widely known among clinicians. Historically clinicians were told that ICS time to onset of anti-inflammatory effects took days to occur. Recent evidence indicates a more rapid onset (minutes) of action of ICS due to the complementary mechanisms of nongenomic and genomic effects,.

Implementing AIR and MART for asthma management and exacerbations may be limited by national and local restrictions and product availability. PCCs are encouraged to increase awareness of available options for AIR and MART in their local areas, including the use of SABA-ICS as a combination inhaler. In areas where such products are unavailable, patients may be instructed to take a dose of ICS each time they use a SABA inhaler (ICS and SABA in separate inhalers), though this can be more cumbersome for patients.

Additionally, some patients may receive their current asthma treatment primarily via nebulizer, which does not easily lend to AIR or MART but can be accommodated by ICS-SABA quick relief therapy. In general, nebulizers are not considered the best practice to deliver asthma treatment and should be discouraged. ICS/SABA rescue therapy may be added to any asthma maintenance regimen and newer combination inhaler therapies may facilitate that choice.

### Improving asthma management: the case for mandatory inclusion of dose counters on all rescue bronchodilators [^f7622d10]. The Journal of Asthma (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma-associated morbidity remains high despite improvements in diagnosis and the availability of comprehensive national and international clinical practice guidelines for managing the disease. Avoiding triggers is an important first step in asthma management, but may require lifestyle changes that patients find difficult or unacceptable (e.g. giving away a family pet), and adherence to lifestyle modifications is poor.

If lifestyle changes do not successfully prevent and control asthma symptoms, pharmacologic therapy can reduce the frequency and severity of asthma exacerbations, and reverse airflow obstruction during acute attacks. Most asthma medications are delivered as orally inhaled products in order to achieve local effects in the lung and to minimize systemic adverse effects. Inhaled asthma medications are categorized into two general classes: long-term control medications (also known as preventive or maintenance medications), which are taken regularly to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma, and rapid-acting drugs (also known as rescue medications) taken as needed to provide prompt reversal of acute airflow limitation and relieve bronchospasm. Onset of action of inhaled drugs for rescue from acute bronchospasm is approximately 5–10 minutes. Rescue medications are typically short-acting β2-adrenergic agonists (SABAs), such as albuterol, but may be a long-acting beta agonist with rapid onset of action, such as formoterol. Bronchodilators provide relief of bronchoconstriction by relaxing bronchial smooth muscle and functionally enlarging the luminal diameter of the airways. This decreases airflow obstruction so that breathing becomes less labored. SABAs are delivered via wet nebulization or metered dose inhaler (MDI). MDIs may provide better clinical outcomes and fewer adverse effects compared with nebulizers ; however, nebulizers are useful for young children, older adults, and for patients who are unable to use an MDI.

### Understanding the journeys of patients with an asthma exacerbation requiring urgent therapy at a primary care clinic [^b8b26259]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

An asthma exacerbation is an episode of progressive increase in breathlessness, cough, wheezing or chest tightness, and decrease in lung function. Adherence to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) reduces the risk of asthma exacerbations. Local guidelines (2008 Ministry of Health asthma clinical practice guideline and 2020 Agency for Care Effectiveness Clinical Guidance) also recommend providing an Asthma Action Plan (AAP) for all patients to aid in asthma self-management. AAPs reduce hospitalization rates, days off from work or school, and risk of fatal asthma exacerbations.

In Singapore, patients presenting to polyclinics with an acute asthma exacerbation are treated with inhaled bronchodilator therapy: short-acting beta-agonist (SABA), with or without a short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA), administered either via nebulization or metered-dose inhaler with spacer (‘dry nebulizer’ therapy). For the purposes of this study, both forms of inhaled bronchodilator therapy were considered “nebulization” or “nebulizer therapy”. To our knowledge, there has been no local study examining the journeys of patients with an asthma exacerbation to bronchodilator therapy. We conducted this study to explore the factors contributing to poor asthma control and health-seeking behaviors of patients with asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^0c36d300]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Short-acting inhaled beta2 agonist bronchodilators (SABA)—e.g., salbutamol (albuterol), terbutaline—are administered by pMDI, DPI or, rarely, as solution for nebulization or injection. Inhaled SABAs provide quick relief of asthma symptoms and bronchoconstriction and are used for pre-treatment before exercise; SABAs should be used only as-needed (not regularly) and at the lowest dose and frequency required, and SABA-only treatment is not recommended because of the risk of severe exacerbations and asthma-related death. Currently, inhaled SABAs are the most commonly used bronchodilator for acute exacerbations requiring urgent primary care visit or ED presentation. Adverse effects include tremor and tachycardia with initial use; tolerance develops rapidly with even 1–2 weeks of regular use, with increased airway hyperresponsiveness, reduced bronchodilator effect, and increased airway inflammation. Excess use or poor response indicate poor asthma control and risk of exacerbations, and dispensing of 3 or more 200-dose canisters per year is associated with increased risk of exacerbations, while dispensing of 12 or more canisters per year is associated with markedly increased risk of death.

### Clinical reasoning amongst paramedics using nebulised β ₂ agonists to treat acute asthma exacerbations: a qualitative study [^cc2792dd]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Globally the prevalence of asthma continues to increase, resulting in greater demand for prehospital and intrahospital services, with predicted increases in morbidity and mortality. According to the National Review of Asthma Deaths, optimisation of basic primary care can achieve significant reductions in these morbidity and mortality rates. Therefore, it is imperative that first-line treatment in the emergency setting and support during recovery is optimised in terms of effectiveness and timeliness,.

However, despite asthma’s heterogeneous nature, including different phenotypes and compounding variables such as comorbidities, the standard treatment for patients experiencing an exacerbation of asthma has remained constant for over forty years and involves the use of bronchodilator drugs (β₂ agonists) to relieve the associated bronchospasm,. Notwithstanding, recent studies suggest that the use of β₂ agonists may result in negative short and long-term effects, with adverse physiological effects, such as arrhythmia, potentially resulting in reciprocal changes including altered blood pressures and modified respiratory patterns, or metabolic changes including increased blood glucose levels, all which can cause greater ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch –.

Nonetheless, current international asthma guidelines published by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) continue to state that asthma patients in exacerbation should receive ‘ repetitive administration of short-acting inhaled bronchodilators, early introduction of systemic corticosteroids, and controlled flow oxygen supplementation ’ which can be further supported with additional drugs as required, including ipratropium bromide and magnesium. However, in contrast to these guidelines and those published by the British Thoracic Society, UK ambulance services primarily focus on the use of β₂ agonists without the supplementation of corticosteroids, unless the exacerbation is severe or life-threatening in nature.

Given the divergence of asthma patients, the varying degrees of airway inflammation and the variety of physiological changes induced by first-line treatment during exacerbation, this study sought to explore the perceptions and experiences of ambulance paramedics managing acute exacerbations of asthma in the pre-hospital setting and how they alter their management in response to changes in physiological observations and in consideration of other variables.

This focus is important as healthcare providers may not record these observations or perceive them as problematic in the presence of an asthma exacerbation,,,. Furthermore, patients experiencing an exacerbation may be managed solely by paramedics without subsequent examination by a hospital or General Practitioner (GP),.

### Continuous versus intermittent β-agonists in the treatment of acute asthma [^9be6520b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with acute asthma treated in the emergency department are frequently treated with intermittent inhaled beta-agonists delivered by nebulisation. The use of continuous beta-agonist (CBA) via nebulisation in the emergency setting may offer additional benefits in acute asthma.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy (e.g., reductions in admission, improvement in pulmonary functions) and risks (e.g., adverse events, effects on vital signs) of continuous versus intermittent inhaled beta-agonists for the treatment of patients with acute asthma managed in the emergency department.

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Review Group "Asthma and WHEEZ*" Register which is a compilation of systematic searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and CENTRAL and hand searching of 20 respiratory journals. In addition, primary authors and content experts were contacted to identify eligible studies. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews and texts were also searched. The search is considered updated to June 2003.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion. Studies were included if patients presented with acute asthma and were treated with either continuous or intermittent inhaled beta-agonists early in the ED treatment. "Continuous" nebulisation was defined as truly continuous aerosol delivery of beta-agonist medication (e.g., using a commercially available large-volume nebuliser, or a small-volume nebuliser with infusion pump) or sufficiently frequent nebulisations that medication delivery was effectively continuous (i.e., 1 nebulisation every 15 minutes or > 4 nebulisations per hour). Studies also needed to report either pulmonary function or admission results. Two reviewers independently selected potentially relevant articles and two additional reviewers independently selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two reviewers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers if the authors were unable to verify the validity of information. Missing data were obtained from authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper. The data were analysed using the Cochrane Review Manager (Version 4.1). Relative risks (RR), weighted mean differences (WMD) and standardized mean differences (SMD) are reported with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI); both peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV-1) data are reported.

Main Results

165 trials were reviewed and eight were included; a total of 461 patients have been studied (229 with CBA; 232 with intermittent beta-agonists). Overall, admission to hospital was reduced with CBA compared to intermittent beta-agonists (RR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.5 to 0.9); patients with severe airway obstruction at presentation appeared to benefit most from this intervention (RR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.5 to 0.9). Patients receiving CBA demonstrated small but statistically significant improvements in pulmonary function tests when all studies were pooled. Patients receiving CBA had greater improvements in % predicted FEV-1 (SMD: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.5) and PEFR (SMD: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.1 to 0.5); this effect was observed by 2-3 hours. Continuous treatment was generally well tolerated, with no clinically important differences observed in pulse rate (WMD: -2.87; 95% CI: -6.0 to 0.3) or blood pressure (WMD: -1.75; 95% CI: -5.6 to 2.1) between the treatment groups. Tremor was equally common in both groups (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.5 to 1.3) and potassium concentration was unchanged (WMD: 0.02; 95% CI: -0.2 to 0.2).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Current evidence supports the use of CBA in patients with severe acute asthma who present to the emergency department to increase their pulmonary functions and reduce hospitalisation. Moreover, CBA treatment appears to be safe and well tolerated in patients who receive it.

### The acute management of asthma [^a1cb226b]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) or clinic with acute exacerbation of asthma (AEA) can be very challenging varying in both severity and response to therapy. High-dose, frequent or continuous nebulized short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) therapy that can be combined with a short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) is the backbone of treatment. When patients do not rapidly clinically respond to SABA/SAMA inhalation, the early use of oral or parenteral corticosteroids should be considered and has been shown to impact the immediate need for ICU admission or even the need for hospital admission. Adjunctive therapies such as the use of intravenous magnesium and helium/oxygen combination gas for inhalation and for driving a nebulizer to deliver a SABA and or SAMA should be considered and are best used early in the treatment plan if they are likely to impact the patients' clinical course. The use of other agents such as theophylline, leukotriene modifiers, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta2 agonist, and long-acting muscarinic antagonist currently does not play a major role in the immediate treatment of AEA in the clinic or the ED but is an important therapeutic option for physicians to be aware of and to consider initiating at the time of discharge from clinic, hospital, or ED to reduce later clinical worsening and readmission to the ED and hospital. A comprehensive summary is provided of the currently available respiratory pharmaceuticals approved for asthma and other airway syndromes. Clinicians must be prepared to use the entire spectrum of medications available for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations and the agents that should be initiated to prevent worsening or additional exacerbations. They need to be familiar with the major potential drug toxicities associated with their use.

Management of Exacerbations in a Primary Care or Acute Care Facility

Assess exacerbation severity from the patient’s mental state, degree of dyspnea, vital signs, oxygen saturation, and lung function (PEF or spirometry) while starting treatment with repeated administration of SABA (in most patients, by pressurized metered-dose inhaler and spacer) and controlled flow oxygen (sufficient flow to maintain oxygen saturation at 93–95% for adults; 94–98% for children 6–11 yr), if available (Figure 5). Controlled oxygen therapy is associated with lower mortality and better outcomes than high-concentration (100%) oxygen therapy (–).

Figure 5. 
Management of asthma exacerbations in primary care (adults, adolescents, children 6–11 yr). SABA doses are for albuterol. Reproduced by permission from Reference(Box 4-3). PEF = peak expiratory flow; pMDI = pressurized metered-dose inhaler; SABA = short-acting β 2 -agonist.

Arrange immediate transfer to an acute care facility if there are signs of severe exacerbation, or to intensive care, particularly if the patient is drowsy, confused, or has a silent chest. During transfer, give inhaled SABA and ipratropium bromide, controlled oxygen, and systemic corticosteroids.

Repeated administration of albuterol (up to 4–10 puffs every 20 min for the first hour) is effective for rapidly reversing airflow limitation. Avoid nebulization except for life-threatening asthma; delivery of rapid-acting β 2 -agonist via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler and spacer or via a dry-powder inhaler is as effective in patients with moderately severe acute asthma and avoids the risk of disseminating infectious particles. Current evidence does not support the routine use of intravenous β 2 -agonists in patients with severe asthma exacerbations.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^5d77907d]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Treating exacerbations in primary care—initial therapies and short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) use: The main initial therapies include repetitive administration of rapid-acting inhaled bronchodilators, early introduction of systemic corticosteroids, and controlled flow oxygen supplementation. For mild to moderate exacerbations, repeated inhaled SABA up to 4–10 puffs every 20 minutes for the first hour is described, then after the first hour dosing varies from 4–10 puffs every 3–4 hours up to 6–10 puffs every 1–2 hours, or more often, with no additional SABA needed if there is a good response such as peak expiratory flow (PEF) >60–80% of predicted or personal best for 3–4 hours. Delivery via pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) with spacer or dry powder inhaler (DPI) leads to a similar improvement in lung function as nebulizer; patients with acute severe asthma were not included in these studies. The most cost-effective route is pMDI and spacer, provided the patient can use this device, and some spacers require pre-washing with detergent before use; the manufacturer’s advice should be followed.

### Emergency physicians' preferences in bronchodilator delivery for asthma exacerbations: a cross-sectional study [^b449cdf7]. The Journal of Asthma (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Asthma is a chronic respiratory disorder characterized by airway inflammation and narrowing often leading to acute exacerbations that necessitate a visit to the emergency department (ED). While life threatening cases usually require bronchodilator delivery by nebulizers, mild to moderate acute asthma exacerbations can be treated by bronchodilators delivered either by metered dose inhalers (MDI). Numerous studies have attempted to compare between the two modalities and have drawn similar conclusions in that both are comparable in efficacy with minimal differences. What is evident, however, is that physicians remain inclined to favor nebulizers in the majority of acute asthma exacerbations.

Methods

In this questionnaire-based study, a survey was distributed to physicians who treat asthma exacerbations to examine demographics, knowledge, beliefs, and current practice in regard to bronchodilator therapy.

Results

The majority (90.8%) of physicians prefer short-acting beta agonists via nebulizer, with 9.2% favoring MDI+spacer. Participants include consultants, residents, and specialists across various emergency disciplines. While 90.1% find MDI+spacer equally effective as nebulizers, advantages cited include cost-effectiveness (49.6%), shorter ED stays (63.4%), quicker administration (67.9%), and ease of use (58.8%). Challenges include availability (66.4%) and ineffectiveness in younger patients (45%). Despite this, 65.6% are willing to switch to MDI for initial asthma management in the ED, while 34.4% are resistant.

Conclusion

Concerns about availability and effectiveness in younger patients remain barriers. However, a significant number are willing to adopt MDIs with spacers, indicating potential for broader use with better availability and training.

### The use of ipratropium bromide for the management of acute asthma exacerbation in adults and children: a systematic review [^90e5908d]. The Journal of Asthma (2001). Low credibility.

Ipratropium bromide is a quaternary anticholinergic bronchodilator that is commonly used to treat obstructive lung disease. Although ipratropium is not usually employed as a first-line bronchodilator to treat chronic asthma, it has been used extensively in hospital emergency departments as adjunctive therapy for the emergency treatment of acute asthma exacerbation. This review will summarize the physiological actions of ipratropium and the rationale for its use as an anticholinergic bronchodilator. Evidence available from randomized trials and from two meta-analyses is summarized to determine whether the addition of inhaled ipratropium to inhaled beta2-agonist therapy is effective in the treatment of acute asthma exacerbation in children and adults. Published reports of randomized, controlled trials assessing the use of ipratropium and concurrent beta2-agonists in adult acute asthma exacerbation were identified by a search of electronic databases, as well as by hand searching. Data from 10 studies of adult asthmatics, reporting on a total of 1377 patients, were pooled in a meta-analysis using a weighted-average method. Use of nebulized ipratropium/beta2-agonist combination therapy was associated with a pooled 7.3% improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.8-10.9%] and a 22.1% improvement in peak expiratory flow (95% CI, 11.0-33.2%) compared with patients who received beta2-agonist without ipratropium. For the three trials in adults reporting hospital admission data (n = 1064), adult patients receiving ipratropium had a relative risk of hospitalization of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.61-1.06). Similarly, randomized controlled studies of pediatric asthma exacerbation and a meta-analysis of pediatric asthma patients suggest that ipratropium added to beta2-agonists improves lung function and also decreases hospitalization rates, especially among children with severe exacerbations of asthma. The adult and pediatric studies did not report any severe adverse effects attributable to ipratropium when it was used in conjunction with beta2-agonists. In conclusion, there is a modest statistical improvement in airflow obstruction when ipratropium is used as an adjunctive to beta2-agonists for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbation. In pediatric asthma exacerbation, use of ipratropium also appears to improve clinical outcomes; however, this has not been definitively established in adults. It would seem reasonable to recommend the use of combination ipratropium/beta2-agonist therapy in acute asthmatic exacerbation, since the addition of ipratropium seems to provide physiological evidence of benefit without risk of adverse effects.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^5c90d4c1]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Assessment of response and additional bronchodilator treatment—severe exacerbation in children: Children with a severe asthma exacerbation must be observed for at least 1 hour after initiation of treatment; if symptoms persist after initial bronchodilator, a further 2–6 puffs of salbutamol may be given 20 minutes after the first dose and repeated at 20-minute intervals for an hour, consider adding 1–2 puffs of ipratropium, and failure to respond at 1 hour or earlier deterioration should prompt admission to hospital with addition of nebulized ipratropium and a short course of oral corticosteroids. If symptoms have improved by 1 hour but recur within 3–4 hours, the child may be given more frequent doses of bronchodilator (2–3 puffs each hour) and oral corticosteroids should be given, and children who fail to respond to 10 puffs of inhaled SABA within a 3–4 hour period should be referred immediately to hospital. If symptoms resolve rapidly after initial bronchodilator and do not recur for 1–2 hours, no further treatment may be required; further SABA may be given as needed up to every 3–4 hours (up to a total of 10 puffs/24 hours), and if symptoms persist beyond 1 day, inhaled and/or oral corticosteroids are indicated.

### Regular vs ad-lib albuterol for patients hospitalized with acute asthma [^ee04fc39]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Inhaled, short-acting beta-agonists and systemic corticosteroids form the mainstay of therapy in acute asthma exacerbation. Asthma, however, is an inflammatory disease of the airways, and its underlying pathology is not impacted by short-acting beta-agonists. While the efficacy of ad-lib beta-agonist administration in outpatient management of asthma symptoms is well established, little data exist to support this strategy in patients with acute, severe asthma. We postulate that as long as patients hospitalized with severe asthma exacerbation receive systemic corticosteroids, regular, scheduled administration of short-acting beta-agonists is unnecessary. Similar therapeutic outcomes can be achieved with the ad-lib administration of the short-acting beta-agonists.

Design

Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

Pulmonary floor of a 600-bed municipal hospital.

Patients Or Participants

Sixty-two patients hospitalized for acute asthma.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive either albuterol nebulizations (regular albuterol group) or saline solution nebulizations (ad-lib group) every 4 h with management of breakthrough symptoms with albuterol metered-dose inhaler or nebulizations for both groups. All patients received systemic corticosteroids. Peak expiratory flows, asthma symptoms, and need for rescue bronchodilator were followed up on each patient until discharge.

Results

There was no significant difference in the length of hospitalization (median length, 48 h for ad-lib group vs 57.5 h for regular albuterol group, p = 0.82), rate of improvement in peak flow, or symptoms between the two groups. Ad-lib beta-agonist use compared to regular albuterol scheduled use resulted in a significant reduction in the total number of albuterol treatments administered (median, 7 treatments vs 19 treatments, p = 0.001) during hospitalization.

Conclusions

In the management of asthma exacerbation, ad-lib administration of albuterol is therapeutically as effective as regular, scheduled administration. This method of drug administration also reduces the total dose of beta-agonists received by the hospitalized patient.

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^b80b10a6]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Inhaled Bronchodilators

The cornerstone in management of asthma and COPD exacerbations is inhaled bronchodilators to treat bronchial hyperreactivity and to reduce airflow obstruction (Table 2). First-line therapy is short-acting β-agonists (SABAs). SABAs can be delivered equally effectively using a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer device, with a dry power inhaler, or via a nebulizer; however, nebulized administration may be preferred for patients who are in respiratory distress or who are unable to cooperate with inhalers.– Adult patients who are critically ill with severe exacerbations should be treated with short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMAs) in addition to SABAs. In severe asthma exacerbations managed in the ED, the combination of SABAs and SAMAs resulted in greater improvement in peak expiratory flow to FEV 1 ratio and fewer hospitalizations compared with SABA treatment alone. No quality studies have evaluated the role of SAMAs in COPD exacerbations or among patients in the ICU; however, they are recommended for severe exacerbations.

### Inhaled anticholinergics and short-acting beta (2)-agonists versus short-acting beta2-agonists alone for children with acute asthma in hospital [^8a0c3b23]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled anticholinergics given in addition to β2-agonists are effective in reducing hospital admissions in children presenting to the emergency department with a moderate to severe asthma exacerbation. It seems logical to assume a similar beneficial effect in children hospitalised for an acute asthma exacerbation.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of anticholinergics added to β2-agonists as inhaled or nebulised therapy in children hospitalised for an acute asthma exacerbation. To investigate the characteristics of patients or therapy, if any, that would influence the magnitude of response attributable to the addition of anticholinergics.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR), which is derived through systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED and PsycINFO and through handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. The search is current to November 2013.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing the combination of inhaled or nebulised anticholinergics and short-acting β2-agonists versus short-acting β2-agonists alone in children one to 18 years of age hospitalised for an acute asthma exacerbation were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of trials and extracted data; disagreement was resolved by consensus or with the input of a third review author, when needed. Primary outcomes were duration of hospital stay and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes included admission and duration of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), ventilation assistance, time to short-acting β2-agonists spaced at four hours or longer, supplemental asthma therapy, duration of supplemental oxygen, change from baseline in asthma severity, relapse after discharge, adverse health effects and withdrawals.

Main Results

Seven randomised trials were included, four of which reported usable data on 472 children with asthma one to 18 years of age who were admitted to paediatric wards. No trials included patients admitted to the ICU. The anticholinergic used, ipratropium bromide 250 μg, was given every one to eight hours over a period from four hours to the entire length of the hospital stay. Two of four trials (50%) contributing data were deemed of high methodological quality. The addition of anticholinergics to β2-agonists showed no evidence of effect on the duration of hospital admission (mean difference (MD) -0.28 hours, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.07 to 4.52, 3 studies, 327 participants, moderate quality evidence) and no serious or non-serious adverse events were reported in any included trials. As a result of the similarity of trials, we could not explore the influence of age, admission site, intensity of anticholinergic treatment and co-interventions on primary outcomes. No statistically significant group difference was noted in other secondary outcomes, including the need for supplemental asthma therapy, time to short-acting β2-agonists spaced at four hours or longer, asthma clinical scores, lung function and overall withdrawals for any reason.

Authors' Conclusions

In children hospitalised for an acute asthma exacerbation, no evidence of benefit for length of hospital stay and other markers of response to therapy was noted when nebulised anticholinergics were added to short-acting β2-agonists. No adverse health effects were reported, yet the small number of trials combined with inadequate reporting prevent firm reassurance regarding the safety of anticholinergics. In the absence of trials conducted in ICUs, no conclusion can be drawn regarding children with impending respiratory failure. These findings support current national and international recommendations indicating that healthcare practitioners should refrain from using anticholinergics in children hospitalised for acute asthma.

### Corticosteroid therapy for acute asthma [^34bd996f]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease, which is characterised by reversible airflow obstruction in response to a variety of stimuli. Exacerbations in response to airway irritants are part of the natural history of asthma, but often they also represent a failure in chronic treatment. Presentations to emergency departments and other acute care settings are common and frequently lead to hospitalisation and other complications. After treatment, however, most patients are discharged to the care of their primary care physician for further management. This review highlights the role of systemic and inhaled corticosteroids as mainstays of treatment in the acute and sub-acute phase of an exacerbation. These agents form the basis of most current clinical practice guidelines, yet their use is not universal. We will review the evidence for the use of these agents that arises from the Cochrane Collaboration of Systematic Reviews contained in the Cochrane Library.

### Nebulized inhaled corticosteroids in asthma treatment in children 5 years or younger: a systematic review and global expert analysis [^4c311744]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Although nebulized corticosteroids (NebCSs) are a key treatment option for young children with asthma or viral-induced wheezing (VIW), there are no uniform recommendations on their best use. This systematic review aimed to clarify the role of NebCSs in children 5 years or younger for the management of acute asthma exacerbations, asthma maintenance therapy, and the treatment of VIW. Electronic databases were used to identify relevant English language articles with no date restrictions. Studies reporting efficacy data in children 5 years or younger, with a double-blind, placebo- or open-controlled, randomized design, and inclusion of 40 or more participants (no lower patient limit for VIW) were included. Ten articles on asthma exacerbation, 9 on asthma maintenance, and 7 on VIW were identified. Results showed NebCSs to be at least as efficacious as oral corticosteroids in the emergency room for the management of mild to moderate asthma exacerbations. In asthma maintenance, nebulized budesonide, the agent of focus in all trials analyzed, significantly reduced the risk of further asthma exacerbations compared with placebo, cromolyn sodium, and montelukast. Intermittent NebCS treatment of VIW was as effective as continuous daily treatment. In summary, NebCSs are effective and well tolerated in patients 5 years or younger for the management of acute and chronic asthma.

(see Sidebar 3)”. If yes, initiate short-acting acute bronchodilator therapy (albuterol ± ipratropium MDI with spacer or via nebulizer) and administer oxygen if necessary, then arrange transfer. If no, obtain history, physical exam, and tests as clinically indicated to evaluate for alternate diagnoses, then initiate short-acting acute bronchodilator therapy (albuterol +/- ipratropium MDI with spacer or via nebulizer) and administer oxygen if necessary. A subsequent decision asks “Are acute symptoms resolved?”; if yes, consider continuing short-acting bronchodilator therapy, initiating long-acting bronchodilator therapy, initiating steroid therapy, and initiating antibiotic therapy; if no, arrange transfer. After improvement, arrange follow-up, instruct the patient to contact the clinic if condition deteriorates, and return to the primary care pathway.

Asthma exacerbations are a significant cause of health care use and mortality. Home management strategies may be effective in managing many exacerbations before presentation to a health care institution. This article focuses on the variety of options available to patients and providers to choose from as they customize an asthma self-management plan. Literature regarding short-acting bronchodilators is reviewed along with studies on more controversial therapies, such as use of home oral steroids, inhaled corticosteroid and beta agonist combination therapy, and macrolides in acute asthma exacerbations.

### A randomized, clinical trial comparing the efficacy of continuous nebulized albuterol (15 mg) versus continuous nebulized albuterol (15 mg) plus ipratropium bromide (2 mg) for the treatment of acute asthma [^b9517962]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Multiple studies have examined adding nebulized ipratropium bromide to intermittent albuterol for the treatment of acute asthma. Although continuous nebulized treatments in themselves offer benefits; few data exist regarding the efficacy of adding ipratropium bromide to a continuous nebulized system. To compare continuous nebulized albuterol alone (A) vs. albuterol and ipratropium bromide (AI) in adult Emergency Department (ED) patients with acute asthma, a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial was conducted on a convenience sample of patients (IRB approved). The setting was an urban ED. Consenting patients > 18 years of age with peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) < 70% predicted, between October 15 and December 28, 1999, were randomized to albuterol (7.5 mg/h) + ipratropium bromide (1.0 mg/h), or albuterol alone via continuous nebulization using the Hope Nebulizer (B&B Technologies Inc., Orangevale, CA) for 2 h. Main outcome measures were changed in mean improvement at 60 and 120 min PEFR compared to baseline (time 0). Secondary measures were admission rates. Data were analyzed using appropriate parametric and non-parametric tests (p < 0.05 statistically significant). Sixty-two patients (30 women) completed enrollment: 32 in (AI) and (30) in (A). Four (A) and 2 (AI) patients are without 120 min data: 3 (A) and 1 (AI) were discharged after 60 min, whereas one each (A) and (AI) worsened and were admitted before 120 min. There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in age, sex, predicted or initial PEFR. Thirteen (19.4%) patients were admitted. There was no statistically significant difference in improvement of mean PEFR at 60 min or 120 min compared to baseline, between groups, using repeated measures analysis of variance. Mean improvement in PEFR at 60 min compared to baseline (time 0): (A) = 93.2 L/min (95% confidence interval [CI] 64.5-121.8), (AI) = 86.6 L/min (95% CI 58.9-114.3); mean improvement in PEFR at 120 min compared to baseline (time 0) (A) = 116.5 L/min (95% CI 84.5-148.5), (AI) = 126.4 L/min (95% CI 95.4-157.4). There was no statistically significant difference in admission rates between groups: 5/30 (A) and 8/32 (AI) (p = 0.62). There were no significant differences in mean improvement of PEFR at either 60 or 120 min between ED patients with acute asthma receiving continuous albuterol alone vs. those receiving albuterol in combination with ipratropium bromide.

### Combined inhaled anticholinergics and short-acting beta2-agonists for initial treatment of acute asthma in children [^ed6b9d10]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There are several treatment options for managing acute asthma exacerbations (sustained worsening of symptoms that do not subside with regular treatment and require a change in management). Guidelines advocate the use of inhaled short acting beta2-agonists (SABAs) in children experiencing an asthma exacerbation. Anticholinergic agents, such as ipratropium bromide and atropine sulfate, have a slower onset of action and weaker bronchodilating effect, but may specifically relieve cholinergic bronchomotor tone and decrease mucosal edema and secretions. Therefore, the combination of inhaled anticholinergics with SABAs may yield enhanced and prolonged bronchodilation.

Objectives

To determine whether the addition of inhaled anticholinergics to SABAs provides clinical improvement and affects the incidence of adverse effects in children with acute asthma exacerbations.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE (1966 to April 2000), EMBASE (1980 to April 2000), CINAHL (1982 to April 2000) and reference lists of studies of previous versions of this review. We also contacted drug manufacturers and trialists. For the 2012 review update, we undertook an 'all years' search of the Cochrane Airways Group's register on the 18 April 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomized parallel trials comparing the combination of inhaled anticholinergics and SABAs with SABAs alone in children (aged 18 months to 18 years) with an acute asthma exacerbation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used the GRADE rating system to assess the quality of evidence for our primary outcome (hospital admission).

Main Results

Twenty trials met the review eligibility criteria, generated 24 study comparisons and comprised 2697 randomised children aged one to 18 years, presenting predominantly with moderate or severe exacerbations. Most studies involved both preschool-aged children and school-aged children; three studies also included a small proportion of infants less than 18 months of age. Nine trials (45%) were at a low risk of bias. Most trials used a fixed-dose protocol of three doses of 250 mcg or two doses of 500 mcg of nebulized ipratropium bromide in combination with a SABA over 30 to 90 minutes while three trials used a single dose and two used a flexible-dose protocol according to the need for SABA.The addition of an anticholinergic to a SABA significantly reduced the risk of hospital admission (risk ratio (RR) 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 0.85; 15 studies, 2497 children, high-quality evidence). In the group receiving only SABAs, 23 out of 100 children with acute asthma were admitted to hospital compared with 17 (95% CI 15 to 20) out of 100 children treated with SABAs plus anticholinergics. This represents an overall number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 16 (95% CI 12 to 29).Trends towards a greater effect with increased treatment intensity and with increased asthma severity were observed, but did not reach statistical significance. There was no effect modification due to concomitant use of oral corticosteroids and the effect of age could not be explored. However, exclusion of the one trial that included infants (< 18 months) and contributed data to the main outcome, did not affect the results. Statistically significant group differences favoring anticholinergic use were observed for lung function, clinical score at 120 minutes, oxygen saturation at 60 minutes, and the need for repeat use of bronchodilators prior to discharge from the emergency department. No significant group difference was seen in relapse rates.Fewer children treated with anticholinergics plus SABA reported nausea and tremor compared with SABA alone; no significant group difference was observed for vomiting.

Authors' Conclusions

Children with an asthma exacerbation experience a lower risk of admission to hospital if they are treated with the combination of inhaled SABAs plus anticholinergic versus SABA alone. They also experience a greater improvement in lung function and less risk of nausea and tremor. Within this group, the findings suggested, but did not prove, the possibility of an effect modification, where intensity of anticholinergic treatment and asthma severity, could be associated with greater benefit.Further research is required to identify the characteristics of children that may benefit from anticholinergic use (e.g. age and asthma severity including mild exacerbation and impending respiratory failure) and the treatment modalities (dose, intensity, and duration) associated with most benefit from anticholinergic use better.

### Management of acute loss of asthma control in the yellow zone: a practice parameter [^e7a8bb68]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Asthma AMD—rationale and caveats emphasize that the LABA formoterol is similar to SABA in rapid bronchodilation, AMD simplifies to a single inhaler and may ensure prompt anti-inflammatory therapy during exacerbations, but symptom-driven care assumes patients perceive worsening symptoms and many fail to perceive their disease control, which may be more common in those with more severe disease with increased hyperresponsiveness and lower lung function.

### Comparison of single 2000-microg dose treatment vs. sequential repeated-dose 500-microg treatments with nebulized budesonide in acute asthma exacerbations [^cb17d8ab]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

High repeated doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are recognized as having a more rapid improvement of outcomes than a single dose of ICS in severe acute asthma. However, to our knowledge, there has been no direct comparison of the early effects of single or repeated administration of the same total dosage of ICS in children with moderate to severe exacerbations of asthma.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of a single dose of 2000 microg of nebulized budesonide with 4 repeated doses of 500 microg of nebulized budesonide in 40 children with an acute asthma exacerbation.

Methods

Randomized, double-blind, parallel study that compared the efficacy of 2000 microg of nebulized budesonide, administered in a single dose, with repeated doses (4 doses of 500 microg each) during the first 90 minutes in 40 children (mean [SD] age, 10.7 [2.4] years) with an acute asthma exacerbation that required treatment with an oral corticosteroid. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second, asthma attack score, and oxygen saturation were evaluated at 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes after initial treatment. Oral corticosteroids were given to all patients at 90 minutes.

Results

There were no significant differences in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (P = .54) at any times between the groups. Also, asthma scores and oxygen saturation were not different in either group within 90 minutes (P = .51 and P = .64, respectively) and thereafter (P = .35 and P = .87, respectively).

Conclusion

The use of a single dose of nebulized budesonide is as effective as repeated administration of the same total dosage during the first 90 minutes before giving oral corticosteroids in children with moderate to severe exacerbations of asthma.

### Comparison of single 7.5-mg dose treatment vs sequential multidose 2.5-mg treatments with nebulized albuterol in the treatment of acute asthma [^97f56d0a]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objective

s: The purpose of the current trial was to compare the relief of airway obstruction from treatment with a single dose of albuterol,7.5 mg (single-dose group), with that from three sequential doses of albuterol, 2.5 mg, spaced 20 min apart (multidose group).

Design

Randomized clinical trial designed to test equivalence.

Setting

Urban county hospital emergency department.

Patients Or Participants

Adult patients between the ages of 18 and 60 years presenting to the emergency department with acute asthma, as defined by the American Thoracic Society criteria, with FEV (1) on presentation to the emergency department of < or = 75% of predicted were included in the study.

Interventions

After the initial evaluation, patients were administered either albuterol, 2.5 mg via nebulizer every 20 min for a total of three doses, or albuterol 7.5 mg via nebulizer in a single dose.

Measurements and Results

Ninety-four patients participated, 46 in the single-dose group and 48 in the multidose group. Patients in both groups had severe obstruction on presentation to the emergency department (single-dose group pretreatment FEV(1), 45% of predicted [SD, 16% of predicted]; multidose group pretreatment FEV(1), 47% of predicted [SD, 17% of predicted]; p = 0.62). The primary outcome measure was the change in FEV(1) percent predicted over time. The secondary outcome measures were disposition after treatment (ie, hospitalization or discharge to home) and the incidence of side effects. We noted a 44.5% improvement (SD, 56.2%) in pretreatment to posttreatment FEV(1) values in the single-dose group and a 38.1% improvement (SD, 37.3%) in the multidose group (p = 0.52). A similar proportion of patients in both groups required hospitalization (single-dose group, 48%; multidose group, 41%; p = 0.51). There was a trend for the patients in the single-dose group to experience more side effects than patients in the multidose group (patients in the single-dose group patients, 40% [SD, 19%]; multidose group patients, 22% [SD, 10%]; p = 0.06).

Conclusion

A single dose of 7.5 mg nebulized albuterol and sequential doses of 2.5 mg nebulized albuterol are clinically equivalent in the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe acute asthma and result in similar dispositions from the emergency department.

### As-needed inhaled corticosteroids as add-on therapy versus SMART therapy: an evolving understanding of the two approaches in the management of moderate-to-severe asthma [^2edce61d]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory disorder, characterized by recurring, reversible airflow obstruction due to inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. Although biologics have provided significant advances in the treatment of asthma, they are expensive, and their use remains restricted to more severe asthma. Additional approaches in the management of moderate-to-severe asthma are necessary.

Recent Findings

ICS-formoterol as maintenance and reliever therapy in asthma and its effect on improved asthma control has been demonstrated in multiple cohorts of asthma. Although ICS-formoterol as maintenance and reliever therapy has been widely validated, there are significant design considerations including the requirement for exacerbation and bronchodilator response and the lack of evidence for effectiveness in patients who use nebulized reliever therapies, which may limit the use of this therapy in selected populations. More recent trials of as-needed ICS have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing asthma exacerbations and improvements in asthma control and may provide an additional therapeutic strategy for individuals with moderate-to-severe asthma.

Summary

Both ICS-formoterol as a maintenance and a reliever as well as as-needed ICS have demonstrated significant improvements in the control of moderate-to-severe asthma. Future investigational work will be necessary to elucidate whether a strategy of ICS-formoterol as maintenance and reliever therapy or an as-needed ICS strategy demonstrates superiority in asthma control in the context of the cost to individual patients and health systems.

### Interventions for escalation of therapy for acute exacerbations of asthma in children: an overview of cochrane reviews [^05ea8315]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is an illness that commonly affects adults and children, and it serves as a common reason for children to attend emergency departments. An asthma exacerbation is characterised by acute or subacute worsening of shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness and may be triggered by viral respiratory infection, poor compliance with usual medication, a change in the weather, or exposure to allergens or irritants. Most children with asthma have mild or moderate exacerbations and respond well to first-line therapy (inhaled short-acting beta-agonists and systemic corticosteroids). However, the best treatment for the small proportion of seriously ill children who do not respond to first-line therapy is not well understood. Currently, a large number of treatment options are available and there is wide variation in management.

Objectives

Main objective - To summarise Cochrane Reviews with or without meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of second-line treatment for children with acute exacerbations of asthma (i.e. after first-line treatments, titrated oxygen delivery, and administration of intermittent inhaled short-acting beta 2 -agonists and oral corticosteroids have been tried and have failed) Secondary objectives - To identify gaps in the current evidence base that will inform recommendations for future research and subsequent Cochrane Reviews - To categorise information on reported outcome measures used in trials of escalation of treatment for acute exacerbations of asthma in children, and to make recommendations for development and reporting of standard outcomes in future trials and reviews - To identify relevant randomised controlled trials that have been published since the date of publication of each included review METHODS: We included Cochrane Reviews assessing interventions for children with acute exacerbations of asthma. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search is current to 28 December 2019. We also identified trials that were potentially eligible for, but were not currently included in, published reviews. We assessed the quality of included reviews using the ROBIS criteria (tool used to assess risk of bias in systematic reviews). We presented an evidence synthesis of data from reviews alongside an evidence map of clinical trials. Primary outcomes were length of stay, hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, and adverse effects. We summarised all findings in the text and reported data for each outcome in 'Additional tables'.

Main Results

We identified 17 potentially eligible Cochrane Reviews but extracted data from, and rated the quality of, 13 reviews that reported results for children alone. We excluded four reviews as one did not include any randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one did not provide subgroup data for children, and the last two had been updated and replaced by subsequent reviews. The 13 reviews included 67 trials; the number of trials in each review ranged from a single trial up to 27 trials. The vast majority of comparisons included between one and three trials, involving fewer than 100 participants. The total number of participants included in reviews ranged from 40 to 2630. All studies included children; 16 (24%) included children younger than two years of age. Most of the reviews reported search dates older than four years. We have summarised the published evidence as outlined in Cochrane Reviews. Key findings, in terms of our primary outcomes, are that (1) intravenous magnesium sulfate was the only intervention shown to reduce hospital length of stay (high-certainty evidence); (2) no evidence suggested that any intervention reduced the risk of intensive care admission (low- to very low-certainty evidence); (3) the risk of hospital admission was reduced by the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta 2 -agonists (moderate-certainty evidence), the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate (high-certainty evidence), and the use of inhaled heliox (low-certainty evidence); (4) the addition of inhaled magnesium sulfate to usual bronchodilator therapy appears to reduce serious adverse events during hospital admission (moderate-certainty evidence); (5) aminophylline increased vomiting compared to placebo (moderate-certainty evidence) and increased nausea and nausea/vomiting compared to intravenous beta 2 -agonists (low-certainty evidence); and (6) the addition of anticholinergic therapy to short-acting beta 2 -agonists appeared to reduce the risk of nausea (high-certainty evidence) and tremor (moderate-certainty evidence) but not vomiting (low-certainty evidence). We considered 4 of the 13 reviews to be at high risk of bias based on the ROBIS framework. In all cases, this was due to concerns regarding identification and selection of studies. The certainty of evidence varied widely (by review and also by outcome) and ranged from very low to high.

Authors' Conclusions

This overview provides the most up-to-date evidence on interventions for escalation of therapy for acute exacerbations of asthma in children from Cochrane Reviews of randomised controlled trials. A vast majority of comparisons involved between one and three trials and fewer than 100 participants, making it difficult to assess the balance between benefits and potential harms. Due to the lack of comparative studies between various treatment options, we are unable to make firm practice recommendations. Intravenous magnesium sulfate appears to reduce both hospital length of stay and the risk of hospital admission. Hospital admission is also reduced with the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta 2 -agonists. However, further research is required to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from these therapies. Due to the relatively rare incidence of acute severe paediatric asthma, multi-centre research will be required to generate high-quality evidence. A number of existing Cochrane Reviews should be updated, and we recommend that a new review be conducted on the use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy. Important priorities include development of an internationally agreed core outcome set for future trials in acute severe asthma exacerbations and determination of clinically important differences in these outcomes, which can then inform adequately powered future trials.

Managing Exacerbations in Children 5 Years and Younger

Early symptoms of exacerbations in young children may include increased symptoms, increased coughing (especially at night), lethargy or reduced exercise tolerance, impaired daily activities including feeding, and a poor response to reliever medication.

Managing Exacerbations at Home

Give a written asthma action plan to parents/caregivers of young children with asthma so they can recognize an impending exacerbation, start treatment, and identify when urgent hospital treatment is required. Initial treatment at home is with inhaled SABA, with review after 1 hour or earlier. If inhaled SABA is needed more often than every 3 hours or for >24 hours, treatment by a health provider is needed on the same day. Parents/caregivers should seek urgent medical care if the child is acutely distressed, lethargic, fails to respond to initial bronchodilator therapy, or is worsening, especially in children younger than 1 year.

Rationale

Most children with wheezing due to asthma respond to SABA. There is insufficient evidence for parent-initiated OCS in this age group. Preemptive, episodic, parent-initiated high-dose nebulized ICS may reduce exacerbations in children with intermittent virally triggered wheezing, but there are no long-term studies, and there is a high risk of side effects; it should only be considered if the clinician is confident that it will be used appropriately and that the child will be monitored closely for side effects.

Managing Exacerbations in Primary Care or Acute Care Facility

Assess the severity of the exacerbation while initiating treatment with SABA (2–6 puffs every 20 min for first hour) and controlled oxygen to maintain a saturation of 94–98%. Arrange immediate transfer to a hospital if the child shows no response to inhaled SABA within 1–2 hours, is unable to speak or drink, has a respiratory rate >40/min or is cyanosed, has oxygen saturation <92% on room air, or cannot be safely cared for at home.

For children attending an ED or admitted to hospital with asthma, consider systemic corticosteroids: oral prednisone/prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/d for up to 5 days (maximum of 20 mg/d for children 0–2 years and 30 mg/d for children 3–5 yr) or dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg/d for 2 days.

### Management of acute loss of asthma control in the yellow zone: a practice parameter [^c6b6e996]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) plus anticholinergics in acute asthma—mixed evidence and dose effect: “There is controversy over the use of anticholinergic agents, such as ipratropium, as a reliever bronchodilator in the care of patients with acute asthma,” with early studies showing that “the greatest improvement in FEV1 occurred at 45 and 90 minutes after therapy with the combined use of ipratropium and fenoterol compared with either alone in 148 patients with asthma with acute exacerbations,” but others found “no long-term benefit,” noting that “Although patients receiving the combination of albuterol plus ipratropium showed greater improvement in FEV1 at 45 minutes, no sustained benefit was seen at 90 minutes …” and that “in most of these studies, a low dose of ipratropium was used.” In contrast, high-dose combination in the ED showed benefit: “4 puffs of high-dose ipratropium therapy (21 µg per puff) and albuterol (120 µg per puff) in 1 inhaler every 10 minutes for 3 hours,” in “180 patients,” produced “greater improvements in PEF (20.5%) and FEV1 (18.4%),” with hospitalization “39% … albuterol alone and … 20% … albuterol-ipratropium combination,” and benefit greatest when “FEV1 of 30% or less of predicted and symptoms for at least 24 hours before ED presentation.”

### Nasal high-flow oxygen versus conventional oxygen therapy for acute severe asthma patients: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^f31346b7]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness and often reversible airflow obstruction. 1 It is one of the most common airway diseases in both children and adults. 1 In Thailand, the prevalence of childhood asthma is currently 10% to 13%. 2, 3 Although the prevalence in adults is lower at 4%, and the mortality rate is decreasing, the disease has not been well controlled with a high rate of exacerbations, emergency department (ED) visits, and hospital admissions. 4, 5

Acute severe asthma, or more commonly referred to as an asthma exacerbation, is characterized by an acute obstruction of expiratory airflow due to airway inflammation, bronchospasm, and hypersecretion, resulting in increased work of breathing. If not reversed, the respiratory muscles may fatigue, therefore leading to hypercapnia, severe hypoxemia, and consequently respiratory failure. Initial management of acute severe asthma in the ED, as recommended by The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guideline, includes early administration of supplemental oxygen as needed as well as medications such as nebulized bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroid. 1 Despite aggressive initial management, in some patients with respiratory failure or hypoxemia, invasive ventilatory support may be required. Otherwise, oxygen is usually given via nasal cannula or nonrebreather mask. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV), which is a promising modality for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), has had limited success in treating acute severe asthma. 6

Nasal high flow (NHF) is another oxygen‐delivering method of inspired fraction (FiO 2) up to 1.0 via a purposely made high‐flow nasal cannula across a range of flows from 2 to 60 L/min. Conditioning of delivered gas by warming to 37°C and fully saturating with water offers patients comfort during the therapy while high flow provides positive airway pressure and decreases rebreathing from anatomic dead space, which leads to a reduced respiratory effort. 7, 8, 9, 10 Many studies have evaluated the use of NHF in critical patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure of multiple etiologies. 11, 12, 13, 14 Its use has also been effective in EDs for patients with all‐cause hypoxemic respiratory failure, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and do‐not‐intubate status. 15, 16, 17 To date, there have been many published studies demonstrating the benefit of NHF in decreasing the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to COPD. 18, 19, 20

### Treatment strategies for reducing asthma-related emergency department visits [^cd29ffd6]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Acute asthma exacerbations reflect inadequate long-term disease control. Treatment to control acute asthma exacerbations includes: 1) rapid reversal of airflow obstruction with bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids and reversing hypoxemia with oxygen in the emergency department (ED); 2) preventing early relapse by prescribing beta(2) agonists and oral corticosteroids at discharge and ensuring patients have an adequate supply of their other asthma medications; and 3) preventing future asthma exacerbations and ED visits through effective treatment in primary care. This article discusses each treatment and reviews the role of emergency physicians in treating patients to reverse airflow obstruction and prevent early relapse, future exacerbations, and ED visits by communicating the need for additional asthma control to patients' primary care physicians.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^f70ca66b]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations—pharmacological treatment and bronchodilator delivery specify that the three classes of medications most commonly used are bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics. For bronchodilators, it is recommended that short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with or without short-acting anticholinergics, are the initial bronchodilators for acute treatment of a COPD exacerbation. A systematic review of the route of delivery of short-acting bronchodilators found no significant differences in FEV1 between using metered dose inhalers (MDI) (with or without a spacer device) or nebulizers to deliver the agent, although the latter may be an easier delivery method for sicker patients. It is recommended that patients do not receive continuous nebulization but use the MDI inhaler one or two puffs every one hour for two or three doses and then every 2-4 hours based on the patient’s response. Although there are no clinical studies that have evaluated the use of inhaled long-acting bronchodilators with or without ICS during an exacerbation, we recommend continuing these treatments during the exacerbation or to start these medications as soon as possible before hospital discharge. Intravenous methylxanthines (theophylline or aminophylline) are not recommended to use in these patients due to significant side effects. If a nebulizer is chosen to deliver the bronchodilator agent, air-driven bronchodilator nebulization is preferable to oxygen-driven in acute exacerbations of COPD.

### Comparison of nebulized budesonide and oral prednisolone with placebo in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a randomized controlled trial [^95978ca9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Nebulized budesonide has been used successfully to treat acute asthma exacerbation, and we hypothesized that it could also be effective for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, the efficacy of nebulized budesonide (Pulmicort Respules/Nebuamp), oral prednisolone, and placebo was compared in 199 patients with acute exacerbations of COPD requiring hospitalization. Patients received from randomization (H(0)) to 72 h (H(72)), 2 mg of budesonide every 6 h (n = 71), 30 mg of oral prednisolone every 12 h (n = 62), or placebo (n = 66). All received standard treatment, including nebulized beta(2)-agonists, ipratropium bromide, oral antibiotics, and supplemental oxygen. The mean change (95% confidence interval) in postbronchodilator FEV(1) from H(0) to H(72) was greater with active treatments than with placebo: budesonide versus placebo, 0.10 L (0.02 to 0.18 L); prednisolone versus placebo, 0.16 L (0.08 to 0.24 L). The difference in FEV(1) between budesonide and prednisolone was not significant, -0.06 L (-0.14 to 0.02 L). The occurrence of serious adverse events was similar for all groups. Budesonide had less systemic activity than prednisolone as indicated by a higher incidence of hyperglycemia observed with prednisolone. Both budesonide and prednisolone improved airflow in COPD patients with acute exacerbations when compared with placebo. Nebulized budesonide may be an alternative to oral prednisolone in the treatment of nonacidotic exacerbations of COPD but further studies should be done to evaluate its long-term impact on clinical outcomes after an initial episode of COPD exacerbation.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^10aa712a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Mild asthma—as-needed low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)–formoterol for symptom relief is supported by randomized evidence, with low-dose ICS–formoterol taken as needed investigated in six randomized controlled trials and showing reduced severe exacerbations by 60–64% compared with as-needed short-acting beta-agonist (SABA). Compared with regular ICS, severe exacerbation risk with as-needed ICS–formoterol was similar in blinded studies or lower in open-label pragmatic trials, and a meta-analysis reported the risk of emergency department presentation/hospitalization was 37% lower versus regular ICS–plus as-needed SABA. As-needed ICS–formoterol was as effective as daily ICS for reducing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, and reductions in severe exacerbations versus regular ICS (or SABA alone) were independent of baseline characteristics; qualitative research found it was preferred by most patients with mild asthma but emphasized shared decision making is needed.

### Reversal of bronchial obstruction with bi-level positive airway pressure and nebulization in patients with acute asthma [^f05659dc]. The Journal of Asthma (2009). Low credibility.

Jet nebulization (JN) and non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) through bi-level pressure is commonly used in emergency and intensive care of patients experiencing an acute exacerbation of asthma. However, a scientific basis for effect of JN coupled with NIMV is unclear. Objective. To evaluate the effect of jet nebulization administered during spontaneous breathing with that of nebulization with NIV at two levels of inspiratory and expiratory pressures resistance in patients experiencing an acute asthmatic episode. Methods. A prospective, randomized controlled study of 36 patients with severe asthma (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV(1)] less than 60% of predicted) selected with a sample of patients who presented to the emergency department. Subjects were randomized into three groups: control group (nebulization with the use of an unpressured mask), experimental group 1 (nebulization and non-invasive positive pressure with inspiratory positive airway pressure [IPAP] = 15 cm H(2)O, and expiratory positive airway pressure [EPAP] = 5 cm H(2)O), and experimental group 2 (nebulization and non-invasive positive pressure with IPAP = 15 cm H(2)O and EPAP = 10 cm H(2)O). Bronchodilators were administered with JN for all groups. Dependent measures were recorded before and after 30 minutes of each intervention and included respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)), forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75% (FEF(25-75)). Results. The group E2 showed an increase of the peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV(1) (p < 0.03) and F(25-75%) (p < 0.000) when compared before and 30 minutes after JN+NIMV. In group E1 the PFE (p < 0.000) reached a significant increase after JN+ NIMV. RR decreased before and after treatment in group E1 only (p = 0.04). Conclusion. Nebulization coupled with NIV in patients with acute asthma has the potential to reduce bronchial obstruction and symptoms secondary to augmented PEF compared with nebulization during spontaneous breathing. In reversing bronchial obstruction, this combination appears to be more efficacious when a low pressure delta is used in combination with a high positive pressure at the end of expiration.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^e1a09c47]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 12-4—Initial emergency department management of asthma exacerbations in children 5 years and younger outlines immediate therapies and dosing. Supplemental oxygen is delivered by face nasal prongs or mask to maintain oxygen saturation at 94–98%. Short-acting beta agonist (SABA) dosing is 2–6 puffs of salbutamol by spacer, or 2.5 mg by nebulizer, every 20 minutes for the first hour, then severity is reassessed; if symptoms persist or recur, give an additional 2–3 puffs per hour and admit to hospital if >10 puffs are required in 3–4 hours. Systemic corticosteroids include an initial oral prednisolone dose of 1–2 mg/kg up to a maximum 20 mg for children <2 years old or 30 mg for children 2–5 years, or intravenous methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg 6-hourly on day 1. Additional options in the first hour are to consider adding ipratropium bromide (1–2 puffs by pMDI and spacer; if poor response to initial SABA, nebulized ipratropium bromide 250 mcg every 20 minutes for 1 hour only) and to consider nebulized isotonic magnesium sulfate (150 mg) as 3 doses in the first hour for children aged ≥2 years with severe exacerbation. If inhalation is not possible, an intravenous bolus of terbutaline 2 mcg/kg may be given over 5 minutes, followed by continuous infusion of 5 mcg/kg/hour.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^ba7dc490]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations, or 'attacks', during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans sometimes advocate a short-term increase in the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at the first sign of an exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of ICS as part of a patient-initiated action plan for the home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and handsearched abstracts to 20 December 2021. We also searched major trial registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel and cross-over randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that allocated people with persistent asthma to take a blinded inhaler in the event of an exacerbation which either increased their daily dose of ICS or kept it stable (placebo).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. We reassessed risk of bias for all studies at the result level using the revised risk of bias tool for RCTs (Risk of Bias 2), and employed the GRADE approach to assess our confidence in the synthesised effect estimates. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as the need for rescue oral steroids in the randomised population. Secondary outcomes were treatment failure in the subset who initiated the study inhaler (treated population), unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, serious and non-serious adverse events, and duration of exacerbation.

Main Results

This review update added a new study that increased the number of people in the primary analysis from 1520 to 1774, and incorporates the most up-to-date methods to assess the likely impact of bias within the meta-analyses. The updated review now includes nine RCTs (1923 participants; seven parallel and two cross-over) conducted in Europe, North America, and Australasia and published between 1998 and 2018. Five studies evaluated adult populations (n = 1247; ≥ 15 years), and four studies evaluated child or adolescent populations (n = 676; < 15 years). All study participants had mild to moderate asthma. Studies varied in the dose of maintenance ICS, age, fold increase of ICS in the event of an exacerbation, criteria for initiating the study inhaler, and allowed medications. Approximately 50% of randomised participants initiated the study inhaler (range 23% to 100%), and the included studies reported treatment failure in a variety of ways, meaning assumptions were required to permit the combining of data. Participants randomised to increase their ICS dose at the first signs of an exacerbation had similar odds of needing rescue oral corticosteroids to those randomised to a placebo inhaler (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.25; 8 studies; 1774 participants; I 2 = 0%; moderate quality evidence). We could draw no firm conclusions from subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, baseline dose, smoking history, and fold increase of ICS on the primary outcome. Results for the same outcome in the subset of participants who initiated the study inhaler were unchanged from the previous version, which provides a different point estimate with very low confidence due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and risk of bias (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; 7 studies; 766 participants; I 2 = 42%; random-effects model). Confidence was reduced due to risk of bias and assumptions that had to be made to include study data in the intention-to-treat and treated-population analyses. Sensitivity analyses that tested the impact of assumptions made for synthesis and to exclude cross-over studies, studies at overall high risk of bias, and those with commercial funding did not change our conclusions. Pooled effects for unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, and duration of exacerbation made it very difficult to determine where the true effect may lie, and confidence was reduced by risk of bias. Point estimates for both serious and non-serious adverse events favoured keeping ICS stable, but imprecision and risk of bias due to missing data and outcome measurement and reporting reduced our confidence in the effects (serious adverse events: OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; 2 studies; 394 participants; I² = 0%; non-serious adverse events: OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; 2 studies; 142 participants; I² = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from double-blind trials of adults and children with mild to moderate asthma suggests there is unlikely to be an important reduction in the need for oral steroids from increasing a patient's ICS dose at the first sign of an exacerbation. Other clinically important benefits and potential harms of increased doses of ICS compared with keeping the dose stable cannot be ruled out due to wide confidence intervals, risk of bias in the trials, and assumptions that had to be made for synthesis. Included studies conducted between 1998 and 2018 reflect evolving clinical practice and study methods, and the data do not support thorough investigation of effect modifiers such as baseline dose, fold increase, asthma severity and timing. The review does not include recent evidence from pragmatic, unblinded studies showing benefits of larger dose increases in those with poorly controlled asthma. A systematic review is warranted to examine the differences between the blinded and unblinded trials using robust methods for assessing risk of bias to present the most complete view of the evidence for decision makers.

### Budesonide nebulization added to systemic prednisolone in the treatment of acute asthma in children: a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial [^8abb9ad9]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled corticosteroids, known to be effective as a maintenance medication in chronic asthma, have also been suggested as a therapy for acute asthma when given at high doses.

Methods

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in children aged 2 to 12 years with moderate or severe acute asthma, as determined based on a clinical score of 5 to 15 points, where 15 is the most severe. We compared the addition of budesonide 1,500 μg vs placebo to standard acute asthma treatment, which included salbutamol, ipratropium bromide, and a single dose of prednisolone 2 mg/kg given at the beginning of therapy. The primary outcome was hospital admission rate within 4 h.

Results

A total of 906 ED visits by children with moderate or severe acute asthma were evaluated. Seventy-five cases out of 458 (16.4%) in the budesonide group vs 82 of 448 (18.3%) in the placebo group were admitted (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.58-1.23; P=.38). However, among cases with high baseline clinical score (≥13), significantly fewer children were admitted in the budesonide group (27 of 76 [35.5%]) than in the placebo group (39 of 73 [53.4%]; OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.19-0.94; P=.03).

Conclusions

The addition of budesonide nebulization did not decrease the admission rate of children with acute asthma overall. However, it may decrease the admission rate of children with severe acute asthma.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^3ed126d8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Start OCS early after presentation. For adults, give prednisolone 40–50 mg/d (or equivalent) for 5–7 days. For children, give prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg (maximum, 40 mg) for 3–5 days. Tapering is not needed if administered for <2 weeks.

Review response of symptoms, vital signs, oxygen saturation and lung function after 1 hour (or earlier if worsening). Give ipratropium bromide only for severe exacerbations. Consider intravenous magnesium sulfate for patients with severe exacerbations not responding to initial treatment.

Do not routinely request chest radiography or routinely prescribe antibiotics for asthma exacerbations.

The decision on whether to hospitalize should be based on the patient’s clinical status, lung function, response to treatment, recent and past history of exacerbations, social support, and ability to manage at home.

Rationale

Currently, inhaled albuterol is the usual bronchodilator in acute asthma management. Similar efficacy and safety of formoterol in the ED have been reported. In one study, high-dose budesonide–formoterol had similar efficacy and safety to SABA in ED patients.

Discharge Management

Before the patient goes home, arrange ongoing treatment. This should include starting ICS-containing controller treatment, preferably ICS–formoterol as MART (Table 1 ; Table E2 andin the online supplement) to reduce the risk of another exacerbation, or stepping up the dose of existing maintenance treatment for 2–4 weeks. Advise patients to use reliever medication as needed, not regularly. Patients prescribed ICS–formoterol as their reliever should return to this after an ED presentation.

### Randomized clinical trial comparing breath-enhanced to conventional nebulizers in the treatment of children with acute asthma [^01473d7c]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of a breath-enhanced and a conventional jet nebulizer in the treatment of children with moderate to severe acute asthma.

Study Design

We enrolled subjects between 6 and 18 years of age presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute asthma and an initial forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 )<70% of predicted. We excluded patients with chronic disease, who required immediate resuscitation, or failed spirometry. Subjects were randomized to breath-enhanced or conventional jet delivery of a 5-mg albuterol treatment. Our primary outcome was change in FEV 1 , and secondary outcomes included change in clinical asthma scores, ED length of stay, disposition, and side effects. Student t test and multivariable linear regression were used to evaluate the primary outcome.

Results

In total, 497 patients were assessed for eligibility with 118 enrolled and 107 subjects available for analysis of the primary outcome. Improvement in FEV 1 was significantly greater with conventional jet nebulizer (mean ΔFEV 1 +13.8% vs +9.1%, P = .04). This difference remained significant after adjustment for baseline differences. Subgroup analysis of 57 subjects with spirometry meeting American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines yielded similar results (mean ΔFEV 1 +14.5% vs +8.5%, P=.03). There were no significant differences in clinical asthma scores, ED length of stay, disposition, or side effects.

Conclusions

Albuterol delivered via conventional jet nebulizer resulted in significantly greater improvement in FEV 1 than albuterol delivered by breath-enhanced nebulizer, without significant differences in clinical measures. Conventional jet nebulizers may deliver albuterol to children with acute asthma more effectively than breath-enhanced nebulizers.

Module B: Management of acute COPD exacerbations—Patients presenting with an acute exacerbation to primary care are assessed/triaged and the need for emergency department or inpatient admission is determined. If there is such an indication, initiate short-acting acute bronchodilator therapy (albuterol ± ipratropium metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with spacer or via nebulizer) and administer oxygen if necessary. If no indication exists, obtain history, physical exam, and tests as clinically indicated to evaluate for alternate diagnoses, and initiate short-acting acute bronchodilator therapy (albuterol ± ipratropium MDI with spacer or via nebulizer) and administer oxygen if necessary. Acute symptoms are evaluated for resolution; if not resolved, consider: continuing short-acting bronchodilator therapy; initiating long-acting bronchodilator therapy; initiating steroid therapy (see Sidebar 4); initiating antibiotic therapy (see Sidebar 5). If symptoms are resolved, arrange follow-up, instruct the patient to contact clinic if the condition deteriorates, and return to the primary care pathway (see Module A).

Background

Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators are recommended as maintenance therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with moderate to severe symptoms or those who are at higher risk for COPD exacerbations. These bronchodilators fall into two classes: long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) and long-acting beta agonists (LABAs), with the once-daily LAMA, tiotropium, and the twice-daily LABAs, salmeterol and formoterol, being the most widely prescribed for COPD. Moreover, monotherapy with a LAMA is considered a first-line therapy option for many patients with moderate to severe COPD.

Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators are most often self-administered with hand-held devices such as pressurized metered-dose inhalers or dry powder inhalers. Some patients, however, have difficulty using hand-held devices (eg, the elderly or cognitively impaired), which can result in inaccurate dosing, poor adherence and potentially poor clinical outcomes. Nebulizers, which are easy to use and offer similar efficacy, are an alternative to hand-held devices. Yet there are limited options for maintenance treatment with nebulized long-acting bronchodilators. Nebulized LABAs (Brovana® [arformoterol tartrate] and Perforomist® [formoterol fumarate]) are currently available; however, these agents are labelled for twice-daily administration. Thus, despite the ascendency of effective and convenient once-daily LAMA bronchodilator therapy (tiotropium bromide) in clinical practice for both reversal of bronchoconstriction and control of acute exacerbations of COPD, and the recent emergence of additional once-daily LAMA, LABA/ICS and LAMA/LABA handheld products, no once-daily nebulized bronchodilator has been available to patients who require or prefer nebulized drug delivery. Revefenacin is the first once-daily anti-muscarinic administered via a standard jet nebulizer to enter late-stage clinical development.

### Budesonide / formoterol and formoterol provide similar rapid relief in patients with acute asthma showing refractoriness to salbutamol [^4d0617c9]. Respiratory Research (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients presenting with symptoms of acute asthma are traditionally treated with short-acting β 2 -agonists. Formoterol is a long-acting β 2 -agonist with a rapid onset of action, producing bronchodilation within 1–3 minutes of inhalation [-]. This effect is comparable with that of salbutamol, making formoterol suitable for the treatment of acute asthma. In this setting, formoterol has proved both safe and efficacious. A large study performed in an emergency room setting by Boonsawat and colleagues showed that high-dose formoterol was as rapid and effective as high-dose salbutamol in reversing bronchoconstriction in patients with severe asthma, but formoterol produced greater improvements than salbutamol in lung function over 4 hours. For this reason, formoterol has been licensed for use as both maintenance therapy and as an alternative to salbutamol and terbutaline for the relief of acute asthma symptoms.

Asthma patients experiencing acute symptoms may use their β 2 -agonist reliever medication repeatedly. This can result in downregulation of β 2 -receptors and consequent relative refractoriness to the bronchodilatory effects of this class of drug. High doses of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) have been reported to upregulate these receptors and restore β 2 -agonist responsiveness.

In order to study the potential of this favourable interaction, Pansegrouw examined the use of combined ICS and short-acting β 2 -agonist treatment in patients with acute asthma who initially showed no response to β 2 -agonist therapy. It was reported that 'priming' patients with ICS before commencing nebulised β 2 -agonist treatment was more effective than therapy with the β 2 -agonist alone at improving features of the exacerbation, including lung function. Although, to our knowledge, this study has not been repeated, it raises the prospect that budesonide and formoterol – which are now available together in a combination inhaler (Symbicort ® ; budesonide/formoterol) – may be more effective than formoterol given alone in treating patients with acute asthma who initially show no response to β 2 -agonist therapy. The present study was designed to compare the efficacy of budesonide/formoterol with that of formoterol for the treatment of patients with acute asthma who had evidence of relative refractoriness to the administration of a short-acting β 2 -agonist.

### Bronchodilatory effect of inhaled budesonide / formoterol and budesonide / salbutamol in acute asthma: a double-blind, randomized controlled trial [^24316d8f]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

The results of our study and other studies suggest that formoterol has rapid bronchodilator action similar to salbutamol or terbutaline and possibly can be used as rescue drug for acute exacerbations in children. We had earlier compared bronchodilator action of two long acting beta agonists (formoterol and salmeterol) at 60 min in a randomized controlled trial and observed similar improvement in FEV1. In this study, no comparisons were done in first 10 min of administration of the drugs. International guidelines recommend against monotherapy with LABA in the management of asthma.

However, there are few concerns regarding long-term, frequent use of LABAs. The extent of tolerance to β-adrenoceptor agonists is dependent on the dose and duration of treatment. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in adults by Haney and Hancox assessed tolerance to the bronchodilator action of salbutamol during ongoing treatment with long-acting beta-agonist. They concluded that the bronchodilator response to salbutamol was significantly reduced in patients taking formoterol. Clinically relevant tolerance to rescue beta-agonist treatment may occur in patients treated with long-acting beta-agonists. Therefore, it is important to document that repeated doses of formoterol as rescue drugs will not affect response to treatment in acute exacerbation of asthma.

A systematic review evaluated the effects of the combination of LABA and inhaled corticosteroids versus a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids on the risk of asthma exacerbations. The authors concluded that combination of LABA and ICS was more effective in reducing the risk of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids than a higher dose of ICS in adolescents and adults; in children there was no significant reduction, but rather a trend towards an increased risk of oral steroid-treated exacerbations and hospital admissions was observed. Hence, the issue of safety in children on long term use is yet to be resolved.

The strength of our study was that it was a double blind, randomized controlled trial with adequate sample size. We enrolled children with mild acute exacerbation of asthma. We used metered dose inhalers to deliver single dose (two actuations of MDI for each drug) as these devices are commonly used in the management of asthma. Unlike previous studies, we used a combination of ICS and formoterol. Clinical and spirometric parameters were monitored as early as 1-min post administration of the drug and frequent observations at 5, 15, 30 and 60 min were done.

### Is nebulized saline a placebo in COPD? [^9f8f186c]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Nebulized saline is used by some doctors and physiotherapists to assist mucus clearance and to relieve breathlessness in patients with COPD, bronchiectasis and Cystic Fibrosis. This practice is justified by a small number of studies which have demonstrated enhanced sputum expectoration or improved breathlessness after nebulized saline or humidified oxygen [-]. Nebulized hypertonic or isotonic saline has been used to obtain induced sputum specimens from patients with asthma and COPD for diagnostic and experimental purposes [-]. For example, Vlachos-Mayer and colleagues used increasing strengths of nebulized saline (from isotonic up to 5%) to induce sputum in 304 patients with asthma and 25 patients with COPD. Satisfactory specimens were obtained in 93% of cases, 17% of asthmatic patients and 56% of COPD patients required only isotonic saline to achieve sputum induction.

However, nebulized saline has also been used as a placebo in several trials involving nebulized bronchodilator therapy. For example, Jenkins et al found in a double blind study that patients reported clinical benefit from nebulized saline (with MDI bronchodilator therapy) which was similar to the subjective response to nebulized bronchodilator therapy given with placebo MDI therapy. It was assumed that these patients had a placebo response to nebulized saline but it is also possible that they may have experienced a non-bronchodilator benefit from nebulized saline. We have designed a trial to determine whether the symptomatic benefit associated with nebulized saline use in clinical trials is a placebo effect or a non-bronchodilator therapeutic effect.

SECTION IV: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE USE OF INTERMITTENT ICS IN THE TREATMENT OF ASTHMA

Background

Scheduled, daily ICS treatment is the currently preferred pharmacologic controller therapy for persistent asthma in individuals of all ages. Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR-3), published in 2007, suggested that intermittent ICS dosing schedules may be useful in some settings, but the evidence at that time was insufficient to support a recommendation in favor of this treatment beyond a recommendation based on expert consensus.

Definitions of terms used in this section

“Intermittent” ICS dosing in this section includes courses of ICS treatment used for brief periods, usually in response to symptoms or as an add-on with or without a LABA. “Intermittent ICS dosing” does not refer to a single regimen, and its definition is specified in each of the recommendations. Intermittent ICS dosing allows providers to prescribe specific doses, frequencies, and durations of ICS use. When to use intermittent ICS dosing could depend on an individual’s decision (based on need, which is also known as “as-needed” or “pro re nata” dosing), a predefined index showing worsening asthma, or some other predefined criterion.

“Controller therapy” refers to medications that are taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma.Both controller therapy and intermittent dosing may involve daily use of a specific dose of an ICS. The terms “ICS-LABA” (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta 2 -agonist combination, typically in a single device) and “ICS-formoterol” indicate combination therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually and preferably in a single inhaler.

“Quick-relief” therapy refers to medications (eg, an inhaled SABA) used to treat acute symptoms or exacerbations.In this section, “as-needed” dosing (eg, of a SABA) is intermittent and is based on the patient’s decision (Figs 2 – 4).

The definitions of “low-,” “medium-,” and “high-dose” ICS are based on the recommendations from EPR-3.

The term “puff” refers to a single actuation and inhalation of a medication delivered through any type of inhaler.

“Recurrent wheezing” as used for the studies included in this section is defined as three or more episodes of wheezing triggered by apparent respiratory tract infections in a child’s lifetime or two episodes in the past year.

### Optimizing bronchodilation in the prevention of COPD exacerbations [^11f4aeb1]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The natural trajectory of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is punctuated by exacerbations, defined as an acute worsening of symptoms that results in additional therapy. In many cases, exacerbations are triggered by respiratory tract infections (predominantly viral, but also bacterial) and environmental factors such as air pollution, yet in approximately one third of cases, the cause remains unknown.

COPD exacerbations have a marked negative effect on both the patient and underlying disease processes, and can result in hospitalization and readmission, an increased risk of death and a significant reduction in health status. Exacerbations are also associated with long-term decline in lung function and a high socioeconomic cost. Thus, optimizing the prevention and management of COPD exacerbations is an important clinical issue.

A key step towards meeting this goal is to identify patients at greatest risk of exacerbation. The ‘frequent exacerbator’ phenotype (≥2 exacerbations/year) describes patients who are particularly susceptible to exacerbations, in contrast to infrequent exacerbators. The exacerbator phenotype, which remains relatively stable over time, has a complex pathophysiology and is prevalent across all disease severities, but is more common in patients with worse lung function.

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) provides treatment recommendations for patients who are at high risk of exacerbation: a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) or a long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA)/LAMA combination are recommended as primary choice treatment for these patients. Although the GOLD strategy document was developed with an international audience in mind, some countries and regions (e.g. Spain, UK, South America, and Canada) follow guidance outlined in their own recommendations as well.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are recommended for patients at high risk of exacerbation with concomitant asthma, or who experience further exacerbations following initial bronchodilator treatment. However, there is widespread evidence of inappropriate use of ICS in patients at low risk of exacerbation. Considering the known risks associated with long-term ICS use, only patients carefully considered as suitable candidates should receive treatment with the appropriate ICS and associated dose, such that treatment benefit will outweigh any potential risk.

### Comparison of a rapid albuterol pathway with a standard pathway for the treatment of children with a moderate to severe asthma exacerbation in the emergency department [^f5047ef8]. The Journal of Asthma (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to determine if a rapid albuterol delivery pathway with a breath-enhanced nebulizer can reduce emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS), while maintaining admission rates and side effects, when compared to a traditional asthma pathway with a standard jet nebulizer.

Methods

Children aged 3-18 presenting to a large urban pediatric ED for asthma were enrolled if they were determined by pediatric asthma score to have a moderate to severe exacerbation. Subjects were randomized to either a standard treatment arm where they received up to 2 continuous albuterol nebulizations, or a rapid albuterol arm where they received up to 4 rapid albuterol treatments with a breath-enhanced nebulizer, depending on severity scoring. The primary endpoint was ED LOS from enrollment until disposition decision. Asthma scores, albuterol dose, side effects, and return visits were also recorded.

Results

A total of 50 subjects were enrolled (25 in each arm). The study LOS was shorter in the rapid albuterol group (118 vs. 163 minutes, p = 0.0002). When total ED LOS was analyzed, the difference was no longer statistically significant (192 vs. 203 minutes, p = 0.65). There were no statistically significant differences with respect to admission rates, asthma score changes, side effects, or return visits.

Conclusion

A rapid albuterol treatment pathway that utilizes a breath-enhanced nebulizer is an effective alternative to traditional pathways that utilize continuous nebulizations for children with moderate to severe asthma exacerbations in the ED.

### Recombinant human deoxyribonuclease for the treatment of acute asthma in children [^5c37288f]. Thorax (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Airway obstruction in acute asthma is the result of airway smooth muscle contraction, inflammation and mucus plugging. Case reports suggest that mucolytic therapy might be beneficial in acute asthma. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of the mucolytic drug recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase) in addition to standard treatment at the emergency department in children with an asthma exacerbation.

Methods

In a multicentre randomised double-blind controlled clinical trial, 121 children brought to the emergency room for a moderate to severe asthma exacerbation were randomly assigned to receive either a single dose of 5 mg nebulised rhDNase or placebo following the second dose of bronchodilators. An asthma score (scale 5-15) was assessed at baseline and at 1, 2, 6, 12 and 24 h. The primary outcome variable was the asthma score 1 h after the study medication.

Results

One hour after the study medication the asthma score in the rhDNase group showed an adjusted mean decrease from baseline of 1.0 (95% CI 0.5 to 1.6) points compared with 0.7 (95% CI 0.3 to 1.2) points in the placebo group (mean difference 0.4 (95% CI -0.2 to 1.0) points; p = 0.23). The asthma score over the study period of 24 h also did not differ significantly between the rhDNase and placebo group (mean difference 0.2 (95% CI -0.3 to 0.7) points, p = 0.40). The duration of oxygen supplementation and number of bronchodilator treatments in the first 24 h were similar in both groups.

Conclusion

Adding a single dose of nebulised rhDNase to standard treatment in the emergency room has no beneficial effects in children with moderate to severe acute asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^43fb50ba]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, other treatments, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to do not use IV aminophylline or theophylline for the management of asthma exacerbations due to their poor efficacy and safety profile, and the greater effectiveness and relative safety of short-acting β-agonist.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^c0664696]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)—in the emergency department, high-dose ICS given within the first hour after presentation reduces the need for hospitalization in patients not receiving systemic corticosteroids (Evidence A); when added to systemic corticosteroids, evidence is conflicting in adults, and in children early ICS with or without systemic corticosteroids might reduce hospital admission and need for systemic corticosteroids (Evidence B). Overall, add-on ICS are well tolerated, but the agent, dose and duration remain unclear and cost may be significant; patients admitted to hospital for an asthma exacerbation should continue on, or be prescribed, ICS-containing therapy. On discharge home, patients should be prescribed ongoing ICS-containing treatment because severe exacerbation is a risk factor for future exacerbations (Evidence B) and ICS-containing medications significantly reduce asthma-related death or hospitalization (Evidence A); SABA-only treatment of asthma is no longer recommended, and adding ICS to systemic corticosteroids after discharge showed no significant short-term benefit, though post-discharge ICS were as effective as systemic corticosteroids for milder exacerbations with wide confidence limits.

### Protective effect of budesonide / formoterol compared with formoterol, salbutamol and placebo on repeated provocations with inhaled AMP in patients with asthma: a randomised, double-blind, cross-over study [^658480ba]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The short-acting β 2 -agonist salbutamol is widely used as first-line treatment in the management of acute bronchoconstriction in asthma because of its fast onset of action. The long-acting β 2 -agonist formoterol has an onset of effect that is comparable with that of salbutamol and, when used as reliever therapy, has proven to be superior to terbutaline and salbutamol in improving asthma control and preventing asthma exacerbations [-]. The combination of budesonide and formoterol in one inhaler, used as maintenance treatment, improved asthma control compared with a similar or higher dose of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) alone. Furthermore, budesonide/formoterol is also effective in situations of acute and severe bronchoconstriction, indicating that it is effective as a reliever therapy. Clinical studies have substantiated that budesonide/formoterol can be used as both maintenance and reliever therapy, resulting in improved asthma control and an additional reduction in exacerbation frequency compared with maintenance therapy plus a separate bronchodilator for relief [-]. The effectiveness of this novel treatment regimen, where patients use budesonide/formoterol as their only medication, is thought to be the result of a rapid increase in ICS dose at the earliest onset of symptoms.

A single dose of an ICS is thought to have limited bronchodilating effects and some immediate bronchoprotective effect. In addition, an ICS has a vasoconstrictor effect in the airway mucosa, which can be measured within hours of administration.

Inhaled adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) induces rapid degranulation of airway mast cells leading to bronchoconstriction and airway oedema and is, therefore, considered to mimic acute asthma attacks caused by allergen, cold air or exercise. Bronchodilators can reverse AMP-induced bronchoconstriction and can also immediately protect against AMP-induced bronchoconstriction [-]. Long-term ICS treatment has a protective effect on bronchial hyperresponsiveness, as measured with inhaled AMP, but an ICS has also a small immediate protective effect against AMP induced bronchoconstriction, which lasts for several hours.

In daily life, patients with asthma can be repeatedly exposed to allergic and non-specific triggers resulting in airway constriction and asthma attacks. The present study was, therefore, designed to assess the protective effect of a single low dose of budesonide/formoterol with that of β 2 -agonist treatment only (formoterol or salbutamol) and placebo against repeated exposure to an indirect stimulus, AMP.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^39077729]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Ages 0–4 years asthma quick-relief medications—use inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) as needed for symptoms, with intensity based on severity and up to 3 treatments at 20-minute intervals as needed; caution that increasing use of SABA or use >2 days a week for symptom relief (not prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction [EIB]) generally indicates inadequate control and may require a step up in treatment; consider short course of oral systemic corticosteroid if exacerbation is severe or individual has history of previous severe exacerbations.

### Nebulizer versus metered dose inhaler with space chamber (MDI spacer) for acute asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation: attitudes of patients and healthcare providers in the COVID-19 era [^6dd5ddbf]. The Journal of Asthma (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Short-acting bronchodilators for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are commonly delivered by nebulizers although administration using metered dose inhaler with space chamber (MDI spacer) has been shown to be equally efficacious. There are few studies examining patients' and healthcare providers' attitudes on the two administration methods in adults. This study explores patients' and healthcare providers' attitudes on the use of nebulizer versus MDI spacer for acute asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults.

Methods

Patients admitted for asthma or COPD exacerbations, doctors, and nurses in a university-affiliated hospital were surveyed from 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021 regarding their views on the effectiveness, ease of use, preparation and administration, side effects, and infection risk of the two administration methods.

Results

Ninety-nine patients, 103 doctors, and 650 nurses completed the survey. 60.6% of patients perceived nebulizer to be more effective. Patients who found nebulizer more comfortable were more likely to prefer nebulizer (OR 43.97, p =0.01), while those who associated it with a greater infection risk were less likely to prefer nebulizer (OR 0.15, p =0.03). 49.5% of doctors and 49.1% of nurses perceived nebulizer to be more effective, compared to 10.7% and 34.5%, respectively, for MDI spacer. Effectiveness and patient comfort influenced doctors' and nurses' preference for nebulizer while ease of preparation and administration influenced nurses' preference only.

Conclusions

Patients and healthcare providers perceived nebulizer to be more effective. Factors unique to each group influenced their preference for nebulizer.

### Spacers versus nebulizers in treatment of acute asthma-a prospective randomized study in preschool children [^8a45928f]. The Journal of Asthma (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare administration of bronchodilators by nebulizers with delivery by metered dose inhalers (MDIs) with spacers and to evaluate the clinical effect of the treatment of acute asthma in preschool children.

Methods

A prospective randomized clinical trial in a pediatric emergency department (PED). Preschool children who were admitted for virus induced wheezing or acute asthma exacerbation were randomly allocated to receive bronchodilator treatment by nebulizer or by metered dose inhaler. The accompanying parents completed a questionnaire.

Results

The length of stay in the PED and the hospitalization rate were similar and no difference was seen in the parents' view of ease of use and device acceptance. Baseline data were similar for both groups apart from the family history of asthma and atopic disease that was greater in the nebulizer group. No significant differences were seen in heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation at baseline and after the treatment. According to the parents 40% of the participants had asthma diagnosis though up to 66% had some kind of asthma medication.

Conclusions

Our data suggests that MDIs with spacers are at least as effective as nebulizers in the delivery of beta agonists to treat preschool children with virus induced wheezing or acute exacerbations of asthma in the PED. Parents may underestimate the gravity of their children's asthma. It is mandatory to provide adequate information to the staff and parents in order to treat pediatric acute asthma successfully.

### Adverse outcomes associated with short-acting beta-agonist overuse in asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^98f3203f]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

SABA have been a mainstay in asthma treatment since their introduction in the 1950s. The adverse effects of SABA treatment in patients with asthma have long been reported and are under extensive investigation. A cohort analysis published in 1994 revealed an association between beta‐agonist use and excess mortality. Another early report noted a significant association between asthma‐related ED visits or hospital admissions and SABA prescriptions, which helped usher in the concept that SABA prescription fills can be used as a marker of asthma morbidity. It was discovered that the use of SABA nebulizers was associated with poor asthma control or acute exacerbations, which presented as asthma‐related ED visits and hospitalizations. As more studies have been done to explore the association, there is growing evidence showing the risk of overreliance on SABA. In 2019, a fundamental change was introduced in GINA reports. Since then, SABA monotherapy has no longer been recommended for mild asthma for associated complications. Instead, anti‐inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy containing ICS‐formoterol is preferred and recommended in step 1–2 asthma treatment. Moreover, ICS‐formoterol has been recommended as maintenance and reliever therapy (MART) for step 3–5 asthma management after studies showed ICS‐formoterol significantly reduced severe exacerbations and hospital admissions compared to SABA alone.

Treatment with SABA remains safe when used in limited amounts or prescribed alongside ICS. The adverse effects of SABA use primarily result from excessive dosage. In the SABINA program, the positive association between SABA overuse and severe exacerbations or deaths has been reported. The study conducted in Sweden divided the patients into four different groups based on the number of canisters used per year (≤ 2; 3–5; 6–10; and ≥ 11 canisters/year) and analyzed the outcomes after adjusting for confounding factors. Importantly, both the risk of exacerbations and mortality risk increased with an increasing number of SABA canisters used in a dose‐dependent manner. The analysis of patients from Spain revealed a significant dose‐dependent pattern between the number of SABA canisters collected and asthma exacerbation risk. Another meta‐analysis including 24 RCTs investigated the safety of SABA relievers regardless of whether SABA were overused and showed that appropriate use of SABA monotherapy within the prescribed limit may not contribute to increased mortality or acute exacerbations. Hence, the complications caused by SABA appear to be dose‐dependent and are seen more often in those who overuse SABA.

### Different oral corticosteroid regimens for acute asthma [^bc93adda]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common long-term breathing condition that affects approximately 300 million people worldwide. People with asthma may experience short-term worsening of their asthma symptoms; these episodes are often known as 'exacerbations', 'flare-ups', 'attacks' or 'acute asthma'. Oral steroids, which have a potent anti-inflammatory effect, are recommended for all but the most mild asthma exacerbations; they should be initiated promptly. The most often prescribed oral steroids are prednisolone and dexamethasone, but current guidelines on dosing vary between countries, and often among different guideline producers within the same country. Despite their proven efficacy, use of steroids needs to be balanced against their potential to cause important adverse events. Evidence is somewhat limited regarding optimal dosing of oral steroids for asthma exacerbations to maximise recovery while minimising potential side effects, which is the topic of this review.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of any dose or duration of oral steroids versus any other dose or duration of oral steroids for adults and children with an asthma exacerbation.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.ClinicalTrials.gov), the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/) and reference lists of all primary studies and review articles. This search was up to date as of April 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of blinding or duration, that evaluated one dose or duration of oral steroid versus any other dose or duration, for management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies involving both adults and children with asthma of any severity, in which investigators analysed adults and children separately. We allowed any other co-intervention in the management of an asthma exacerbation, provided it was not part of the randomised treatment. We included studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only and unpublished data.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results for included trials, extracted numerical data and assessed risk of bias; all data were cross-checked for accuracy. We resolved disagreements by discussion with the third review author or with an external advisor.We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or risk differences (RDs) using study participants as the unit of analysis; we analysed continuous data as mean differences (MDs). We used a random-effects model, and we carried out a fixed-effect analysis if we detected statistical heterogeneity. We rated all outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and presented results in 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included 18 studies that randomised a total of 2438 participants - both adults and children - and performed comparisons of interest. Included studies assessed higher versus lower doses of prednisolone (n = 4); longer versus shorter courses of prednisolone (n = 3) or dexamethasone (n = 1); tapered versus non-tapered courses of prednisolone (n = 4); and prednisolone versus dexamethasone (n = 6). Follow-up duration ranged from seven days to six months. The smallest study randomised just 15 participants, and the largest 638 (median 93). The varied interventions and outcomes reported limited the number of meaningful meta-analyses that we could perform.For two of our primary outcomes - hospital admission and serious adverse events - events were too infrequent to permit conclusions about the superiority of one treatment over the other, or their equivalence. Researchers in the included studies reported asthma symptoms in different ways and rarely used validated scales, again limiting our conclusions. Secondary outcome meta-analysis was similarly hampered by heterogeneity among interventions and outcome measures used. Overall, we found no convincing evidence of differences in outcomes between a higher dose or longer course and a lower dose or shorter course of prednisolone or dexamethasone, or between prednisolone and dexamethasone.Included studies were generally of reasonable methodological quality. Review authors assessed most outcomes in the review as having low or very low quality, meaning we are not confident in the effect estimates. The predominant reason for downgrading was imprecision, but indirectness and risk of bias also reduced our confidence in some estimates.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence is not strong enough to reveal whether shorter or lower-dose regimens are generally less effective than longer or higher-dose regimens, or indeed that the latter are associated with more adverse events. Any changes recommended for current practice should be supported by data from larger, well-designed trials. Varied study design and outcome measures limited the number of meta-analyses that we could perform. Greater emphasis on palatability and on whether some regimens might be easier to adhere to than others could better inform clinical decisions for individual patients.

### Clinical efficacy of vibrating mesh and jet nebulizers with different interfaces in pediatric subjects with asthma [^e043f6c0]. Respiratory Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Nebulizers are commonly used in emergency departments to deliver bronchodilators to children with asthma exacerbations. However, no clinical study comparing a vibrating mesh nebulizer with a jet nebulizer is available in this patient population. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy of a vibrating mesh nebulizer to a jet nebulizer combined with a mouthpiece or mask in children with asthma exacerbations admitted to the emergency department.

Methods

We conducted a single-blinded randomized clinical trial of 217 children (2-18 y old) with a moderate to severe asthma exacerbation in the emergency department. Assessment of severity was defined by our acute asthma score, adapted from the Pediatric Asthma Score. Subjects were randomized to receive bronchodilator treatment via vibrating mesh nebulizer ( n = 108) or jet nebulizer ( n = 109) and were treated until they achieved a mild asthma score and were discharged or until a decision to admit was made. All subjects were treated per our acute asthma clinical pathway algorithm for the emergency department with modifications to allow for blinding, assessment of treatment, and data collection. Outcome variables included hospital admission rate, number of treatments, and time to mild asthma score.

Results

There was a significant difference in baseline asthma score between subjects treated with the vibrating mesh nebulizer and those treated with the jet nebulizer ( P = .042), but no other significant differences in demographics existed between groups. To adjust for effect of baseline asthma score, a multiple logistic regression model was used to model admission. The vibrating mesh nebulizer group had a lower probability of being admitted to the hospital ( P = .062), and they required significantly fewer treatments ( P < .001) and less time to reach a mild asthma score ( P = .004) than those in the jet nebulizer group. In subjects with a mask interface, the vibrating mesh nebulizer significantly reduced the probability of admission ( P = .032).

Conclusions

Subjects treated with a vibrating mesh nebulizer required significantly fewer treatments and less time to achieve a mild asthma score. In subjects with a mask interface, the vibrating mesh nebulizer significantly reduced the probability of admission compared to jet nebulizer. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT02774941.).

### Aerosol delivery device selection for spontaneously breathing patients: 2012 [^8657301c]. Respiratory Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Aerosol delivery device—large-volume nebulizer (LVN) for continuous therapy: LVNs with a fill volume > 10 mL, powered by a compressed gas source, are utilized to administer continuous aerosol delivery over a prolonged period of time, and due to changes in drug concentration over time, LVNs should be emptied and refilled at 5 hours. An alternative approach for continuous nebulization is small volume jet or mesh nebulizer with infusion pump, and a face mask is typically used as the interface for continuous nebulization. Prior reports indicate that continuous‑inhaled bronchodilator administration is safe, effective, and less time consuming when compared with intermittent nebulization in patients with severe asthma, and continuous bronchodilator delivery is the most common aerosol treatment for continuous nebulization.

### Heliox for treatment of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^08c3601d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Due to its low density properties, helium-oxygen mixtures have the potential to decrease the work of breathing and possibly avoid the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation in patients with respiratory failure.

Objectives

To determine the effect of the addition of helium/oxygen mixtures (heliox) to standard medical care during ventilated and nonventilated acute exacerbations of COPD.

Search Strategy

Randomized controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Review Group asthma Register. Primary authors and experts were contacted. References from included and excluded studies, known reviews and texts were also searched.

Selection Criteria

Studies were selected for inclusion if they compared treatment with heliox to placebo (oxygen or air) in randomized controlled trials in adults with an exacerbation of COPD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data from all trials were combined using the Review Manager (version 4.1). We planned to perform: 1) random effects weighted mean difference (WMD), with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), 2) Homogeneity of effect sizes with the Dersimonian and Laird method with p<0.1 as the cut point for significance, and 3) sensitivity analysis on different helium-oxygen mixtures (80/20 vs 70/30), and 4) methodological quality (Jadad score >2 vs. <3).

Main Results

Four studies, all published between 1997 and 2000 met the inclusion criteria. Two studies compared heliox-oxygen vs. air-oxygen in decompensated COPD patients who were not ventilated. One study was performed in mechanical ventilated patients and one in patients undergoing noninvasive pressure support (NIPSV) ventilated patients. Data could be obtained for only two of the studies. One was a randomized crossover study of 70:30 helium-oxygen vs air-oxygen that involved nineteen patients with acute severe COPD, hospitalized in an intensive care unit for NIPSV. In the patients receiving heliox, arterial PCO2 fell more; WMD 0.8 kPa (95% CI 0.26, -1.34). The second was a randomized trial involved 47 patients with acute COPD, who presented to an Emergency Department randomized to receive updraft nebulization of albuterol and ipratropium bromide using 80% helium and 20% oxygen or compressed air as the driving gas. Treatments were administered at 0, 20, 40, and 120 minutes after randomization. There were no significant differences in the change of FEV1 and FVC between the two groups by either the 1 or 2 hours point. although a small improvement in FEF 25-75 was significantly greater in the heliox group than in the air group.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of helium-oxygen mixtures to treat acute exacerbations of COPD in either ventilated or nonventilated patients. Suitably designed randomised controlled trials with the endpoint being the avoidance of mechanical ventilation may be justified.

### Salbutamol via metered-dose inhaler with spacer versus nebulization for acute treatment of pediatric asthma in the emergency department [^2d5c9c1e]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of salbutamol delivered via a metered-dose inhaler with spacer versus a nebulizer for acute asthma treatment in the pediatric emergency department.

Methods

All consecutive children younger than 14 years old who required treatment of acute asthma exacerbation in the emergency department during May 2002 (prospective cohort, n = 321) and May 2001(retrospective cohort, n = 259) were included. Inhaled salbutamol was administered by metered-dose inhaler with a spacer (and a face mask in children younger than 2 years old) in the prospective cohort and by nebulizer in the retrospective cohort.

Results

There were no significant differences between the two cohorts in the mean (+/-SD) age (44.50 +/- 38.64 vs. 48.37 +/- 43.55 months) and asthma treatment, arterial oxygen saturation (96.34 +/- 2.12% vs. 96.19 +/- 6.32%), and heart rate (123.71 +/- 23.63 vs. 129.41 +/- 34.55 beats/min) before emergency department consultation. The number of doses of inhaled bronchodilators was also similar (1.42 +/- 1.01 vs. 1.45 +/- 0.98) as well as the number of children that required a stay in the observation unit, admission to the hospital, or returned for medical care. The overall mean length of stay in the emergency department was slightly shorter in the prospective cohort (82 +/- 48 vs. 89 +/- 52 minutes).

Conclusions

The administration of bronchodilators using a metered-dose inhaler with spacer is an effective alternative to nebulizers for the treatment of children with acute asthma exacerbations in the emergency department.

### Efficacy of metered-dose inhalers for children with acute asthma exacerbations [^bd3f299b]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of the administration of inhaled beta-agonists delivered via a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with spacers--as part of an evidence-based asthma pathway developed to manage acute asthma exacerbations in children at the emergency room level and in inpatient management--against administration via nebulization.

Design

Case with historical control.

Setting

KK Women's and Children's Hospital (Singapore).

Participants

A total of 19,951 children (infants to older children) aged 18 years and younger who attended the emergency room for asthma exacerbations.

Main Outcome Measures

Average length of stay, proportion admitted to high dependency or intensive care, proportion readmitted for unresolved symptoms within 72 hr, cost per patient and overall.

Results

There was no increase in the mean proportion of emergency room attendances admitted to inpatient care with use of an MDI (mean difference 0.97%, 95% CI: -1.6-3.5%, P = 0.447), nor of children admitted to intensive care (0.21 vs. 0.20 pre- and post-pathway, P = 0.827) or to high dependency units (2.21 vs. 1.37 pre- and post-pathway, P = 0.200) but a significant reduction in the within 72 hr re-attendance rate (mean difference 1.4%, 95% CI: 0.78-2.0%, P < 0.001) with use of an MDI. The average length and cost per patient for an inpatient stay for acute asthma exacerbations was reduced with use of an MDI.

Conclusions

The use of an MDI with spacer as part of an evidence-based asthma pathway was effective in the management of acute asthma exacerbations in the emergency room setting and for inpatient management.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^ebefc851]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Nebulizer use and infection control—If local risk of COVID-19 is moderate or high, avoid use of nebulizers where possible due to the risk of transmitting infection to other patients/family and to healthcare workers. Nebulizers can transmit respiratory viral particles across distances of at least 1 m. Use of nebulizers for delivering bronchodilator therapy is mainly restricted to management of life-threatening asthma in acute care settings. Instead, to deliver short-acting beta2 agonist for acute asthma in adults and children, use a pressurized metered-dose inhaler and spacer, with a mouthpiece or tightly fitting face mask, if required. Check the manufacturer's instructions about whether a spacer can be autoclaved. If not (as is the case for many types of spacers), or if in doubt, spacers should be restricted to single patient use. If use of a nebulizer is needed in settings where COVID-19 infection is possible, strict infection control procedures should be followed.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^ee387499]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Asthma quick-relief medications—individuals ages 0–4 years: Use inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) as needed for symptoms, with intensity based on symptom severity allowing up to 3 treatments at 20-minute intervals as needed. Caution: Increasing use of SABA or use >2 days a week for symptom relief (not prevention of EIB) generally indicates inadequate control and may require a step up in treatment. Consider short course of oral systemic corticosteroid if exacerbation is severe or individual has history of previous severe exacerbations.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^ffe4805f]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, other treatments, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider administering ipratropium in addition to short-acting β-agonists for the management of moderate-to-severe exacerbations in the emergency department to reduce hospitalizations in adult,
adolescent, and pediatric patients
and to improve peak expiratory flow and FEV1 in adolescent and adult patients.

### Budesonide / formoterol and formoterol provide similar rapid relief in patients with acute asthma showing refractoriness to salbutamol [^e4a3bda7]. Respiratory Research (2006). Low credibility.

It is also possible that the dose of budesonide used in this study was too low. In patients who deteriorate whilst on regular doses of ICS, doubling the maintenance dose when symptoms of an exacerbation become apparent has not been shown to be effective in preventing the exacerbation, but a fourfold increase in dose at the onset of an exacerbation may be beneficial. These studies [-] examined the effects of treatment on patients over weeks and months; the study that we describe here assessed the efficacy of treating exacerbations over a 180-minute time period. Studies involving budesonide/formoterol for maintenance and reliever therapy have shown that timely increases in the budesonide/formoterol dose as the symptoms of loss of control of asthma become apparent can result in a marked reduction in exacerbations. These results suggest that treatment with an ICS and long-acting β 2 -agonist combination (at the dose administered in the present study) is effective in preventing severe exacerbations if given very early, when the symptoms of loss of asthma control first become apparent, but may be less beneficial for patients in whom an exacerbation has become established. In our study investigating symptom relief in patients with acute asthma, the long-acting β 2 -agonist alone was as effective as the combination therapy – even in patients presenting for emergency treatment who had used their short-acting β 2 -agonist liberally and appeared to be refractory to β 2 -agonist therapy, as judged by poor bronchodilatory response to short-acting β 2 -agonists.

In addition to being effective, both budesonide/formoterol and formoterol were safe and well tolerated in the present study. The patterns of adverse events raised no safety concerns and, overall, the changes over time in systemic effects were very minor. These results are in line with those from earlier studies. Ankerst and colleagues have reported systemic effects associated with the administration of budesonide/formoterol to be small, and the systemic effects of formoterol have generally been reported as minor and similar to salbutamol.

In conclusion, budesonide/formoterol and formoterol provide rapid relief of acute bronchoconstriction in patients with asthma, producing effects of a similar magnitude. Both preparations are well tolerated.

### Heliox and forward-leaning posture improve the efficacy of nebulized bronchodilator in acute asthma: a randomized trial [^75d8f620]. Respiratory Care (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Heliox and forward-leaning posture (torso inclined forward at 50-60° with the elbows resting on the thighs) are adjuncts in the administration of nebulized bronchodilator to patients with acute asthma.

Methods

We randomized 59 patients who presented to the emergency department in severe asthma crisis, into 4 treatment groups: nebulized bronchodilator + oxygen; nebulized bronchodilator + oxygen + forward-leaning posture; nebulized bronchodilator + heliox; and nebulized bronchodilator + heliox + forward-leaning posture. Before and after the bronchodilator treatments the subjects were seated with torso erect, breathing room air. Each subject received 2 doses, 20 min apart, of nebulized fenoterol (2.5 mg) plus ipratropium bromide (0.25 mg) in 3 mL of 0.9% saline, delivered with a semi-closed valved aerosol reservoir. The nebulizer was run with oxygen or 80:20 heliox. The post-treatment pulmonary function tests were performed 15 min after the second nebulization. The group's mean age was 35.1 ± 13.6 y, and there were 20 men and 39 women.

Results

The oxygen + forward-leaning-posture group had a greater FEV(1) improvement than the oxygen group (59% vs 38%, P = .02). The heliox + forward-leaning-posture group had a greater FEV(1) improvement than the oxygen group (103% vs 38%, P = .001) and the heliox group (103% vs 42%, P = .03). The heliox group had greater reduction in respiratory rate than the oxygen group (P = .03). The heliox + forward-leaning-posture group had significantly greater peak expiratory flow improvement than any of the other groups.

Conclusions

Heliox plus forward-leaning posture during bronchodilator nebulization improves bronchodilator efficacy in patients with severe acute asthma. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT00922350).

### Heliox for nonintubated acute asthma patients [^c916213b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Helium and oxygen mixtures (heliox), have been used sporadically in respiratory medicine for decades. Their use in acute respiratory emergencies such as asthma has been the subject of considerable debate. Despite the lapse of more than 60 years since it was first proposed, the role of heliox in treating patients with acute severe asthma remains unclear.

Objectives

To determine the effect of the addition of heliox to standard medical care on the course of acute asthma, as measured by pulmonary function testing and clinical endpoints.

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Review Group Asthma Register which is a compilation of systematic searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and CENTRAL and hand searching of the 20 most productive respiratory care journals. In addition, primary authors and experts were contacted to identify eligible studies. References from included studies, known reviews and texts were also searched.

Selection Criteria

Studies were selected for inclusion in the review if they met the following inclusion criteria: 1) randomised, single or double blind, controlled trials; 2) children or adults with a clinical diagnosis of acute asthma seen in emergency departments or equivalent acute care settings; and 3) compared treatment with inhaled heliox to placebo (oxygen or air). Two reviewers independently assessed the studies for inclusion and quality assessment; disagreement was resolved by a third reviewer and consensus.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data from all included trials were combined using the Review Manager (Version 4.1) using random effects weighted mean (WMD) and standardised mean differences (SMD), with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Homogeneity of effect sizes were tested with the Dersimonian and Laird method with p<0.1 as the cut point for significance. Sensitivity analyses were performed on age (adults vs. children), different helium-oxygen mixtures (80/20, vs. 70/30 or 60/40), methodological quality (Jadad score >2 vs. <3) and method of heliox use (studies designed to washout air in the lungs and replace it with heliox versus studies that used heliox to deliver nebulized therapy).

Main Results

This review has been updated in 2002 to include two new trials. A total of six randomised controlled trials were selected for inclusion with a total of 369 acute asthma patients. Five studies involved adults and one study dealt solely with children. Two were assessed as high quality (Jadad score >3). The main outcome variable was spirometric measurements (PEF % predicted, PEF L/min, FEV1 % of predicted, FEV1L). Heliox use did not improve pulmonary functions compared to standard care (SMD = 0.13; 95% CI: -0.09 to 0.34). All pulmonary function tests were recorded during heliox administration (15 to 60 min). The test of homogeneity was not significant (p=0.25). There were no significant differences between groups when adults vs. children, high vs. low quality, and high vs. low heliox dose studies were compared.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The existing evidence does not provide support for the administration of helium-oxygen mixtures to ED patients with moderate to severe acute asthma. At this time, heliox treatment does not have a role to play in the initial treatment of patients with acute asthma. Since these conclusions are based upon between-group comparisons and small studies, they should be interpreted with caution. Additional research in this setting is needed.

### High frequency chest wall oscillation for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a randomized sham-controlled clinical trial [^77e445d9]. Respiratory Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acute asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are exceedingly common, which together account for nearly 1 million hospitalizations each year in the United States alone [-]. Beta agonists, anti-cholinergics, and corticosteroids delivered in aerosolized forms (via respiratory inhalers or nebulization) are recommended in the treatment of acute asthma and COPD. These medications rely on deposition into distal airspaces to suppress airway inflammation or promote bronchodilation. Unfortunately, excessive mucous production and impaired airway mucociliaryclearance can lead to airway plugging, and thereby reduce the deposition of and response to aerosolized medications. These considerations highlight the need for therapies that clear airways of mucus in the acute management of asthma and COPD [-].

High frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) creates high velocity, low amplitude oscillatory airflows when applied through a pneumatic vest worn over the thorax, and is used for airway mucus clearance in patients with cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and neuromuscular disorders [-]. Studies in patients with cystic fibrosis suggest that HFCWO applied via a pneumatic vest is as effective as other modes of airway mucus clearance, including hand-held devices (e.g. flutter devices) and conventional chest physiotherapy. HFCWO offers the advantage that it can be performed in acutely ill patients who may be unable to use hand-held devices effectively, such as early in the course of hospitalization. Moreover, HFCWO can be performed without the assistance from trained health care personnel, and may therefore offer a practical advantage compared to chest physiotherapy. Pneumatic vests worn over the chest, however, may not be acceptable to patients with asthma or COPD with worsening respiratory symptoms. To our knowledge, no studies have examined the use of HFCWO in the management of acute asthma or COPD. The objective of this phase II clinical trial (Chest Wall Oscillation for Asthma and COPD ExacerbaTions [COAT] Trial) was therefore to evaluate the use of HFCWO early in the treatment of adults hospitalized for acute asthma or COPD. To minimize the risk of bias, we included active and sham HFCWO treatment groups and standardized medical management in both treatment groups. Preliminary results of this study were previously reported in the form of an abstract.

### Gold 2023: highlights for primary care [^f2d87580]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological treatment

Bronchodilators. Short-acting inhaled β2-agonists (SABA), with or without short-acting anticholinergics (SAMA), are the initial bronchodilators for acute treatment of ECOPD, administered using a metered-dose inhaler (MDI, with a spacer device if necessary, or nebulization. If a nebulizer is chosen, air-driven is preferable to oxygen-driven nebulization to avoid the potential risk of increasing PaCO 2. Intravenous methylxanthines (theophylline or aminophylline) are not recommended due to lack of efficacy and significant side effects,.
Glucocorticoids. Systemic glucocorticoids in COPD exacerbations improve lung function, oxygenation, risk of early relapse, and reduce treatment failures and length of hospitalization –. A dose of 40 mg prednisone-equivalent per day for 5 days is recommended. Longer courses increase risk of pneumonia and mortality. Therapy with oral prednisolone is equally effective as intravenous administration.
Antibiotics. Antibiotics should be given to patients with ECOPD who have increased sputum volume and sputum purulence and most of those require mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive). CRP-guided prescribing of antibiotics for ECOPD in primary care clinics resulted in a reduced proportion antibiotic use with no evidence of harm. The recommended length of antibiotic therapy is 5-7 days. The choice of the antibiotic should be based on the local bacterial resistance pattern.

Non-pharmacologic treatment

Oxygen therapy. Supplemental oxygen for hypoxemia should be titrated to a target saturation of 88-92%. Venturi masks offer more accurate and controlled delivery of inspired oxygen than do nasal prongs.
Non-invasive ventilatory support (NIV). NIV is indicated in patients with respiratory acidosis since it improves gas exchange and decreases respiratory rate, work of breathing, the severity of breathlessness, intubation rates, and mortality,.

It is important that patients are reviewed clinically, and treatment adjusted if needed, after the exacerbation episode.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^5d6cd62d]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Management of asthma exacerbations in a primary care or acute care facility calls to assess severity from dyspnea, respiratory rate, pulse rate, oxygen saturation and lung function while starting SABA and oxygen therapy, with infection control procedures followed. Arrange immediate transfer to an acute care facility for signs of severe exacerbation, or to intensive care if the patient is drowsy, confused, or has a silent chest; during transfer, give inhaled SABA and ipratropium bromide, controlled oxygen and systemic corticosteroids. Start treatment with repeated administration of SABA (in most patients, by pressurized metered-dose inhaler [pMDI] and spacer), early oral corticosteroids, and controlled flow oxygen if available; review response of symptoms, oxygen saturation and lung function after 1 hour, and give ipratropium bromide only for severe exacerbations. Consider intravenous magnesium sulfate for patients with severe exacerbations not responding to initial treatment. Do not routinely request a chest X-ray, and do not routinely prescribe antibiotics for asthma exacerbations. Decide about hospitalization based on clinical status, lung function, response to treatment, recent and past exacerbations, and ability to manage at home.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^8dd9435a]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Treatment in acute care settings—combination inhaled corticosteroid–formoterol (ICS–formoterol) as an alternative to high dose SABA—Compared with SABA, similar efficacy and safety have been reported from emergency department studies with budesonide-formoterol. In this study, patients received 2 doses of budesonide-formoterol 400/12 mcg (delivered dose 320/9 mcg) or 8 doses of salbutamol (albuterol) 100 mcg (delivered dose 90 mcg), repeated once after 5 minutes; all patients received OCS. While more studies are needed, meta-analysis of data from earlier studies comparing high-dose formoterol with high dose salbutamol (albuterol) for treatment of acute asthma in the ED setting suggest that budesonide-formoterol would also be effective, and formoterol alone is no longer used for this purpose.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^41c854b7]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Follow up after an acute exacerbation—discharge medications and review: Discharge medications should include regular maintenance ICS-containing treatment, as-needed reliever medication (low-dose ICS-formoterol, ICS-SABA or SABA) and a short course of OCS; SABA-only treatment is not recommended. Inhaler technique and adherence should be reviewed before discharge, patients should be advised to use their reliever inhaler only as-needed, and a follow-up appointment should be arranged for about 2–7 days later depending on context. At the review visit, assess whether the flare-up has resolved and whether OCS can be ceased, assess symptom control and risk factors, explore the potential cause, and review or provide a written asthma action plan. Maintenance ICS-containing treatment can generally be stepped back to pre-exacerbation levels 2–4 weeks after the exacerbation; however, if the exacerbation was preceded by symptoms suggestive of chronically poorly controlled asthma and inhaler technique and adherence are good, a step up in treatment may be indicated.

### Cromolyn sodium inhalation (cromolyn sodium inhalation solution) [^72c95bf9]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

For management of bronchial asthma in adults and pediatric patients (two years of age and over), the usual starting dosage is the contents of one vial administered by nebulization four times a day at regular intervals.

Drug stability and safety of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established.

Patients with chronic asthma should be advised that the effect of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution therapy is dependent upon its administration at regular intervals, as directed. Cromolyn sodium inhalation solution should be introduced into the patient's therapeutic regimen when the acute episode has been controlled, the airway has been cleared and the patient is able to inhale adequately.

For the prevention of acute bronchospasm which follows exercise or exposure to cold dry air, environmental agents (e.g., animal danders, toluene diisocyanate, pollutants), etc., the usual dose is the contents of one vial administered by nebulization shortly before exposure to the precipitating factor.

It should be emphasized to the patient that the drug is poorly absorbed when swallowed and is not effective by this route of administration.

For additional information, see the accompanying leaflet entitled "Living a Full Life with Asthma".

Cromolyn Sodium Inhalation Solution Therapy in Relation to Other Treatments for Asthma

Non-steroidal agents

Cromolyn sodium should be added to the patient's existing treatment regimen (e.g., bronchodilators). When a clinical response to cromolyn sodium inhalation solution is evident, usually within two to four weeks, and if the asthma is under good control, an attempt may be made to decrease concomitant medication usage gradually.

If concomitant medications are eliminated or required on no more than a prn basis, the frequency of administration of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution may be titrated downward to the lowest level consistent with the desired effect. The usual decrease is from four to three vials per day. It is important that the dosage be reduced gradually to avoid exacerbation of asthma. It is emphasized that in patients whose dosage has been titrated to fewer than four vials per day, an increase in the dose of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution and the introduction of, or increase in, symptomatic medications may be needed if the patient's clinical condition deteriorates.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^f367f121]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Emergency treatment and initial pharmacotherapy—oxygen directs clinicians to treat hypoxemia urgently with oxygen by face mask to achieve and maintain percutaneous oxygen saturation 94–98% (Evidence A). The text notes the potential for overestimation of oxygen saturation in people with dark skin color. To avoid hypoxemia during changes in treatment, acutely distressed children should be treated immediately with oxygen and SABA, using 2.5 mg of salbutamol or equivalent diluted in 3 mL of sterile normal saline delivered by an oxygen-driven nebulizer, and this treatment should not be delayed and may be given before full assessment is completed; transient hypoxemia due to ventilation/perfusion mismatch may occur during treatment with SABAs.

### The efficacy and tolerability of intravenous montelukast in acute asthma exacerbations in Japanese patients [^dd689611]. The Journal of Asthma (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

In Japan, the Asthma Prevention and Management Guidelines recommend nebulized β-agonists, IV (intravenous) drip corticosteroids, as well as IV drip aminophylline for acute asthma treatment. However, current treatment for acute asthma provides inadequate benefit for some patients. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of IV montelukast added to standard therapy in Japanese patients with acute asthma exacerbations.

Methods

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study compared IV montelukast 7 mg, 14 mg, and placebo in Japanese patients with acute asthma exacerbations (N = 242). Fifteen- to sixty-five-year-old patients with acute asthma were treated with standard care during a screening period that lasted ≤60 minutes. Patients with FEV(1) (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) ≤70 predicted were randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups. The primary end point was the time-weighted average change in FEV(1) from baseline over 60 minutes [ΔFEV(1) (0-60 minutes)] after study drug administration. Secondary end points included the time-weighted average change in FEV(1) over 20, 40, and 120 minutes [ΔFEV(1) (0-T min)].

Results

IV montelukast 7 mg was significantly more effective than placebo for the time-weighted average ΔFEV(1) (0-60 minutes) [least squares (LS) mean 0.09 L vs. 0.01 L; p < .05]. IV montelukast 14 mg was also more effective than placebo (LS mean 0.17 L; p < .001). Similar improvements in time-weighted average [ΔFEV(1) (0-T min)] were seen at all time points (all p < .05). Both doses of IV montelukast demonstrated a significant increase in average ΔFEV(1) compared with placebo within 10 minutes of administration (p < .001 to p < .01). The tolerability of IV montelukast was similar to that of placebo.

Conclusion

IV montelukast was significantly more effective than placebo in the improvement of ΔFEV(1) in Japanese patients, suggesting its role as an adjunctive therapy to existing guideline recommendations.

### Teaching time for metered-dose inhalers in the emergency setting [^3f5e9448]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

In some acute-care settings, practitioners are reluctant to institute bronchodilator therapy with metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) as standard management. Such therapy requires that personnel ensure optimal use of these devices. We prospectively evaluated the time required to teach patients correct inhaler use for the emergency treatment of asthma and COPD, and patient factors associated with duration of teaching.

Design

MDI arm within a single-center randomized clinical trial comparing bronchodilator administration by MDI with a delivery enhancement device (MDI/DED) vs delivery by wet nebulizer.

Setting

All subjects were treated for asthma or COPD exacerbations at the respiratory acute-care day hospital of the Montreal Chest Institute, immediately after presentation to our emergency department. Inhaler-use education was provided according to a predetermined protocol.

Measurements

Subjects' baseline characteristics were obtained from medical charts, spirometry, and questionnaires; satisfaction was evaluated by questionnaire. All inhaler-use education was observed and timed.

Results

Sixty-one patients with asthma (median age, 46 years) and 32 patients with COPD (median age, 68.5 years) were randomized to treatment by MDI/DED. Mean FEV1 (percent predicted) was 63.5% for patients with asthma and 39.5% for patients with COPD. Five patients could not complete MDI teaching and therefore received subsequent treatment by wet nebulization. For the 88 other patients, the median teaching time was 6.5 min. Shorter teaching-time requirements were independently associated with higher initial arterial oxygen saturation, home DED use after previous MDI instruction, and a single initial bronchodilator treatment by wet nebulization. Most subjects expressed satisfaction with MDI/DED teaching and treatment.

Conclusions

Successful MDI/DED teaching followed by self-medication is feasible in the emergency setting, based on a simple protocol. A single bronchodilator dose administered by wet nebulization may facilitate subsequent MDI teaching.

Short-acting inhaled β 2 -agonists (SABA), with or without short-acting anticholinergics (SAMA), are the initial bronchodilators for acute treatment of ECOPD, administered using a metered-dose inhaler (MDI), with a spacer device if necessary, or nebulization. If a nebulizer is chosen, air-driven is preferable to oxygen-driven nebulization to avoid the potential risk of increasing Pa CO 2. The GOLD 2023 report recommends continuing treatments with long-acting bronchodilators during the exacerbation or to start these medications as soon as possible before hospital discharge. Intravenous methylxanthines (theophylline or aminophylline) are not recommended due to lack of efficacy and significant side effects.

G

Systemic glucocorticoids in COPD exacerbations improve lung function, oxygenation, and risk of early relapse, and reduce treatment failures and length of hospitalization (–). A dose of 40 mg prednisone-equivalent per day for 5 days is recommended. Longer courses increase the risk of pneumonia and mortality. Therapy with oral prednisolone is equally effective to intravenous administration. Nebulized budesonide may be a suitable alternative to systemic corticosteroids in some patients. Recent studies suggest that glucocorticoids may be less efficacious to treat COPD exacerbations in patients with lower blood eosinophil levels.

A

Antibiotics should be given to patients with ECOPD who have increased sputum volume and sputum purulence and most of those requiring mechanical ventilation (invasive or noninvasive). The recommended length of antibiotic therapy is 5–7 days. The choice of antibiotic should be based on the local bacterial resistance pattern. Usually, initial empirical treatment is an aminopenicillin with clavulanic acid, macrolide, tetracycline, or, in selected patients, quinolone. In patients with frequent exacerbations, severe airflow obstruction and/or exacerbations requiring mechanical ventilation, cultures from sputum or other materials from the lung should be performed, as gram-negative bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas species) or resistant pathogens that are not sensitive to the above-mentioned antibiotics may be present. The route of administration (oral or intravenous) depends on the patient’s ability to ingest medications and the pharmacokinetics of the antibiotic.

A

Additional therapies may be indicated to maintain appropriate fluid balance, treat the comorbidities, and monitor nutritional aspects. Hospitalized patients with COPD are at an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and prophylactic measures for thromboembolism should be instituted. At all times, healthcare providers should strongly enforce the need for smoking cessation.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^b593eb25]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementation of daily and intermittent combination ICS-formoterol in individuals aged 4 years and older:
No patient characteristics exclude consideration of this option in individuals aged 4 years and older with asthma.
The studies demonstrating reduced exacerbations (see below) enrolled individuals with a severe exacerbation in the prior year. The results suggest that such individuals are particularly good candidates for SMART to reduce exacerbations.
SMART might not be necessary for individuals whose asthma is well controlled on alternate treatments, such as conventional maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA as quick-relief therapy.
SMART is appropriate for Step 3 (low-dose ICS-formoterol) and Step 4 (medium-dose ICS-formoterol) treatment.
ICS-formoterol should be administered as maintenance therapy with one to two puffs once to twice daily (depending on age, asthma severity, and ICS dose in the ICS formoterol preparation) and one to two puffs as needed for asthma symptoms. The maximum number of puffs per day is 12 (54 μg formoterol) for individuals aged 12 years and older and 8 (36 μg formoterol) for children aged 4 to 11 years. Clinicians should advise individuals with asthma or their caregivers to contact their physician if they need to use more than these amounts.
The calculation of the dose of formoterol was based on 4.5 μg/inhalation, the most common preparation used in the RCTs reviewed.
ICS-formoterol should not be used as quick-relief therapy in individuals taking ICS-salmeterol as maintenance therapy.
What clinicians should discuss with their patients and families: Clinicians should inform individuals with asthma and their caregivers that in studies, this intervention consistently reduced asthma exacerbations requiring unscheduled medical visits or systemic corticosteroids. In addition, this intervention improved asthma control and quality of life in some studies. No differences have been documented in harms between this type of therapy and the comparators (ICS or ICS-LABA) in individuals aged 12 years and older. The reductions in exposure to oral corticosteroids and to ICS treatment in most studies suggest that the intervention might reduce future corticosteroid associated harms. In children aged 4 to 11 years, there may be a lower risk of growth suppression among those taking SMART versus daily higher-dose ICS treatment. This recommendation might not be appropriate for some individuals with asthma for such reasons as cost, formulary considerations, or medication intolerance. However, the additional cost of the medication may be offset by the decrease in exacerbations and the associated improvement in quality of life and reduction in costs to both the patient and the payer. A 1-month supply of ICS-formoterol medication that is sufficient for maintenance therapy may not last a month if the inhaler is used for reliever therapy as well. Providers, individuals with asthma, pharmacists, and payers need to be aware of this possibility and prescribe, plan, dispense, or provide coverage accordingly.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^47dfd032]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Asthma management—Implementation guidance (use, safety, and counseling for LAMA): The Expert Panel makes suggestions that a LAMA can be used as an add-on to ICS therapy in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled asthma as part of Step 4 therapy, but add-on LABA therapy has a more favorable benefit-harm profile; individuals at risk of urinary retention and those who have glaucoma should not receive LAMA therapy; the small increase in the potential risk of harms from a LAMA may outweigh its benefits in some individuals, particularly in Blacks; LAMA treatment requires appropriate use of specific inhaler devices and clinicians should teach individuals with asthma how to use these devices appropriately; when clinicians prescribe LAMA therapy, they should prescribe this medication for long-term asthma control in the ambulatory setting and that LAMA therapy does not have a role in the management of acute exacerbations of asthma in the ambulatory, emergency department, or inpatient settings; and clinicians should confirm the asthma diagnosis and address factors that often contribute to uncontrolled asthma before considering intensifying therapy by adding a LAMA.

Implementation guidance

Clinician’s Summary:

For individuals aged 12years and older with mild persistent asthma, the Expert Panel recommends either of the following two treatments as part of Step 2 therapy: a daily low-dose ICS and as-needed SABA for quick-relief therapy or intermittent as-needed SABA and an ICS used concomitantly (ie, one after the other) for worsening asthma. In this recommendation, “intermittent” ICS dosing is defined as the temporary use of an ICS in response to worsening asthma in an individual with asthma who is not taking ICS controller therapy regularly. This recommendation does not apply to ages 5 to 11 years because this therapy has not been adequately studied in this age group.

The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementation of intermittent ICS dosing in individuals aged 12 years and older:
Individuals aged 12 years and older with mild persistent asthma who are not taking asthma treatment may benefit from this therapy. The Expert Panel has made no recommendation for children aged 0 to 4 years or 5 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma because of insufficient evidence.
Individuals aged 12 years and older with asthma and a low or high perception of symptoms may not be good candidates for as-needed ICS therapy. Regular low-dose ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy may be preferred for such patients to avoid ICS undertreatment (low symptom perception) or overtreatment (high symptom perception).
Based on the regimen assessed in three of the four studies on intermittent ICS dosing,,, one approach to intermittent therapy is two to four puffs of albuterol followed by 80 to 250 μg of beclomethasone equivalent every 4 hours as needed for asthma symptoms. In these studies, the clinician determined the dosing a priori. Currently, these medications need to be administered sequentially in two separate inhalers, but combination inhalers with albuterol and an ICS may be available in the United States in the future.
Individuals who use this type of therapy can initiate intermittent therapy at home. However, they should receive regular follow-up to ensure that the intermittent regimen is still appropriate.
What clinicians should discuss with patients and families: Clinicians should inform individuals that the two treatment options do not have different effects on asthma control, asthma quality of life, or the frequency of asthma exacerbations when studied in large groups of people. Similarly, side effects are equally infrequent with daily and intermittent use. Shared decision making will allow the best choice to be made for a particular individual.

### Pharmacological strategies for self-management of asthma exacerbations [^49919345]. The European Respiratory Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Written action plans are effective within asthma self-management, but there are few guidelines about the specific medication adjustments which can be recommended for self-treatment of exacerbations. This review examines pharmacological strategies for self-management of asthma exacerbations in adults, including those for inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta2-agonist (ICS/LABA) users. Oral corticosteroids are well-established in clinical practice and clinical trials for the treatment of severe exacerbations, including during combination therapy. Evidence supports 7-10 days treatment, with no need to taper except to reduce side-effects. Doubling the dose of ICS is not effective. Several studies have shown benefit from high-dose ICS (2,400-4,000 microg beclomethasone equivalent) for 1-2 weeks. This may be achieved by adding a high-dose ICS inhaler to maintenance ICS or ICS/LABA therapy. There is inconclusive evidence about acutely increasing the dose of maintenance budesonide/formoterol for exacerbations, and no studies of this approach with fluticasone/salmeterol. For patients taking maintenance budesonide/formoterol, use of the same medication as-needed reduces exacerbations. Short-acting beta2-agonists are still effective in producing bronchodilation during combination therapy; however, a higher dose may be required. There is a need for further studies to clarify remaining issues about self-management of asthma exacerbations, particularly with regard to side-effects of treatment and patient acceptability.

### Influence of ambulatory inhaled treatment with different devices on the duration of acute asthma findings in children [^b6bbe981]. The Journal of Asthma (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Efficacy of bronchodilator treatment in children with asthma depends on the proper use of inhalation devices. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of inhaled bronchodilator treatment with a spacer and a nebulizer in children with acute asthma findings.

Methods

Fifty-eight children with acute asthma findings who received ambulatory inhaled bronchodilator treatment with a nebulizer and 39 with a spacer were enrolled in the study. Duration of asthma, inhaled steroid treatment and the number of exacerbations during the previous year were recorded. Duration of current acute symptoms, exacerbation severity score and duration of respiratory findings after initiation of treatment were also recorded.

Results

Children in both groups were similar in age (76.5 +/- 30.3 months using a nebulizer vs 83.1 +/- 25.1 in spacer group, p = 0.26). Duration after diagnosis of asthma, initiation of inhaled steroid treatment and exacerbation symptoms were similar between groups (p = 0.15, 0.76 and 0.93, respectively). Exacerbation severity score in the nebulizer group was not significantly different from the spacer group (2.6 +/- 0.7 vs 2.8 +/- 0.7 respectively, p = 0.19). Number of exacerbations in the previous year was not different (2.0 +/- 1.2 in the nebulizer group vs 1.6 +/- 0.9 in the spacer group, p = 0.08). Duration of acute asthma findings after initiation of inhaled bronchodilator treatment was similar between the two groups (6.5 +/- 2.9 vs 7.2 +/- 4.6 p = 0.34).

Conclusion

Nebulizers and spacers have similar influence on the duration of acute asthma findings in children when used in ambulatory home bronchodilator treatment.

### Aminophylline [^6bebb964]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Studies:

Inhaled beta-2 selective agonists and systemically administered corticosteroids are the treatments of first choice for management of acute exacerbations of asthma. The results of controlled clinical trials on the efficacy of adding intravenous theophylline to inhaled beta-2 selective agonists and systemically administered corticosteroids in the management of acute exacerbations of asthma have been conflicting. Most studies in patients treated for acute asthma exacerbations in an emergency department have shown that addition of intravenous theophylline does not produce greater bronchodilation and increases the risk of adverse effects. In contrast, other studies have shown that addition of intravenous theophylline is beneficial in the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations in patients requiring hospitalization, particularly in patients who are not responding adequately to inhaled beta-2 selective agonists.

In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), clinical studies have shown that theophylline decreases dyspnea, air trapping, the work of breathing, and improves contractility of diaphragmatic muscles with little or no improvement in pulmonary function measurements.

### Budesonide / formoterol as effective as prednisolone plus formoterol in acute exacerbations of COPD. A double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority, parallel-group, multicentre study [^9d21264d]. Respiratory Research (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major health problem and cause of death and disability. Most patients with COPD suffer from exacerbations, which vary in severity and duration. Frequent exacerbations result in further decline in lung function, quality of life and drive mortality. In addition to intensified therapy with bronchodilators, such as β 2 -agonists and anticholinergics, oral corticosteroids represent standard treatment for COPD exacerbations. The value of oral steroids has been widely recognised but extending the course beyond two weeks has not provided additional clinical benefit. High doses of nebulized budesonide has also been successfully used for treatment of acute COPD exacerbations in the emergency department. Inhaled corticosteroids alone and in combination with long-acting β 2 -agonists [-] have been useful in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe COPD, particularly for prevention of severe exacerbations.

In randomized studies in hospitalized patients with acute severe COPD exacerbations, but not requiring ventilation for acute respiratory failure, treatment with budesonide/formoterol in a single inhaler has been compared to inhaled salbutamol on top of a standardized regimen of exacerbation treatment and to i.v. aminophylline and prednisolone plus inhaled salbutamol. The results of these studies indicated that budesonide/formoterol is safe and may be of clinical benefit to COPD patients with acute exacerbations. Large, controlled studies were proposed to be performed to evaluate the value of budesonide/formoterol in the treatment of acute COPD exacerbations.

Little is known about COPD exacerbations in an out-patient setting. Based on our experience up to 90% of all COPD patients with exacerbations can be treated at primary health care centres and thereafter return home with intensified therapy. It is self-explanatory that these exacerbations are milder than those treated in hospitals or emergency departments. Published clinical studies in patients with COPD exacerbations have been performed in hospitals or in emergency departments. Therefore, we decided to investigate treatment of COPD exacerbations in an out-patient setting and in patients not requiring immediate hospitalisation. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study focused on this type of moderate severe exacerbations. Our hypothesis was that a high dose of the budesonide/formoterol combination could be as effective as prednisolone plus formoterol for this type of acute exacerbations not requiring immediate hospitalisation.

### Nasal high-flow oxygen versus conventional oxygen therapy for acute severe asthma patients: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^019e88ef]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Protocol and Interventions

After arrival in the ED, all patients were assessed consecutively for eligibility by an ED physician. If acute severe asthma was suspected, the physician gave standard treatment as per recommendation, 1 which included up to three doses of nebulized beta‐agonist and anticholinergics every 20 minutes. Oxygen therapy was given via nebulization during a 60‐minute run‐in period. Systemic corticosteroid and magnesium sulfate were given and investigations such as laboratory analysis and chest radiographs were ordered at the discretion of the treating physician. This physician then notified a project investigator, who confirmed and reassessed eligibility at 60 minutes after initial management. This run‐in period was designed to exclude patients whose severity of acute attack was too mild or too severe, who might not have completed the study protocol. If eligibility was confirmed, the project investigator enrolled the patient, obtained informed consent, randomized the interventions, and completed data collection. A computer‐generated, mixed‐block (block size of 2 and 4) randomization for sequence assignment (1:1 ratio) was performed using sealed opaque envelopes.

Enrolled patients were randomized to receive either COT or NHF for 120 minutes. COT was given by a standard oxygen nasal cannula or nonrebreather mask. NHF was delivered by a high‐flow blower‐humidifier AIRVO 2 via Optiflow medium‐sized high‐flow nasal cannula (Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Auckland, New Zealand). The initial NHF rate was 35 L/min and could be adjusted from 30 to 60 L/min according to the participant’s level of comfort. FiO 2 was adjusted in both groups to achieve a steady state SpO 2 of 95% to 99% or 90% to 92% if the patients’ baseline SpO 2 at room was less than 92%.

During the trial, all participants received standard treatments and interventions, including continued doses of bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroid, and magnesium sulfate if not given prior to reassessment, antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and other treatments as deemed appropriate by the treating physician. After the trial, standard of care for acute severe asthma and other treatments were delivered at the discretion of the treating physicians.
