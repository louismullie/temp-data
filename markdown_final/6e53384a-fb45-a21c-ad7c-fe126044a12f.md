## Question

A 45-year-old woman with a history of craniopharyngioma resection presents for follow-up. She has been diagnosed with adipsic diabetes insipidus and is on desmopressin therapy. She reports no sensation of thirst and has had several recent hospitalizations for both hypernatremia and hyponatremia. Her current medications include desmopressin nasal spray and levothyroxine. On examination, her blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg, pulse 82 bpm, and she appears euvolemic. Her most recent serum sodium was 150 mmol/L. The endocrinology team is reviewing her ongoing management plan.

According to current guidelines, what specific clinical and laboratory monitoring should be implemented in this patient to optimize her desmopressin and fluid management?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the specific clinical and laboratory monitoring that should be implemented to optimize desmopressin and fluid management in a 45-year-old woman with adipsic diabetes insipidus after craniopharyngioma resection, who has had recurrent hypernatremia and hyponatremia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of adipsic diabetes insipidus and why it drives both hyper- and hyponatremia. Then, I should verify the highest-credibility guideline sources and extract their monitoring recommendations. Next, I will translate those into a practical outpatient schedule, including sodium targets, weight-based fluid prescription, and dose-adjustment logic. After that, I need to consider special situations like intercurrent illness, perioperative care, and medication interactions. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, actionable plan and confirm safety checks and education elements that align with guidelines and labeling.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology so I don't miss the core risk drivers. Adipsic diabetes insipidus combines central diabetes insipidus with absent thirst, so the patient cannot compensate for water losses and is prone to hypernatremia, yet exogenous desmopressin can cause water retention and hyponatremia if fluid intake is not tightly controlled, which explains the alternating dysnatremias in this case [^ee5eaaf1] [^23e5ffab].

> Next, I should review the highest-credibility guidance. The Endocrine Society guideline explicitly recommends careful titration of desmopressin and fluid intake in adipsic diabetes insipidus with frequent weighing and serum sodium monitoring, and it advises periodic "drug holidays" to allow breakthrough polyuria to mitigate hyponatremia risk, which is foundational here [^2eb9791f] [^7cfee946]. The Society for Endocrinology inpatient guidance supports frequent sodium checks and fluid balance monitoring in unstable patients, which informs escalation during illness or inpatient care [^6585d5d4] [^7c0c0bfa]. Contemporary reviews emphasize fixed desmopressin dosing with fixed daily fluid intake and weight-based adjustments to maintain sodium in a narrow, safe range, which operationalizes outpatient care [^1a47fbc3] [^3c99ca3b].

> I will now examine the outpatient monitoring cadence. Wait, let me verify the frequency. The Endocrine Society suggests frequent serum sodium checks during titration, and expert reviews describe weekly to fortnightly sodium monitoring once stable, with daily weights and fluid adjustments tied to weight changes, which fits this patient's history of recurrent dysnatremias [^2eb9791f] [^3c99ca3b]. I initially thought "every 2–3 days", but that is too aggressive for a stable outpatient; weekly to every two weeks is more aligned with case-based protocols and avoids unnecessary labs while maintaining safety [^3c99ca3b].

> Let me think about the practical fluid and desmopressin strategy. The fixed-dose approach pairs a stable desmopressin regimen with a prescribed daily fluid volume determined when sodium and osmolality are normal, then adjusts fluids by about 1 liter per kilogram of weight change over 24 hours to correct sodium drift, which mechanistically links weight to free-water balance and reduces both hyper- and hyponatremia risk [^1a47fbc3] [^3c99ca3b]. Hold on, I should verify the sodium target; maintaining sodium around 140–150 mmol/L is reasonable in adipsic patients to balance risks, and this range is supported by case-based outcomes showing fewer emergency visits when using this approach [^3c99ca3b].

> Next, I should review the "breakthrough" strategy to prevent hyponatremia. The Endocrine Society recommends that patients periodically experience a phase of polyuria when the medication effect has worn off, typically by omitting or delaying a dose, to allow aquaresis and reset fluid balance; practically, many use a weekly omission or a planned delay, with close sodium checks afterward to ensure we don't overshoot into hypernatremia [^2eb9791f] [^7cfee946]. I need to ensure this is individualized and coordinated with the patient to avoid dangerous hypernatremia during the breakthrough window [^2eb9791f].

> I should confirm inpatient escalation triggers and monitoring density. During intercurrent illness, surgery, or any condition altering intake or output, sodium should be checked far more frequently, with many guidelines recommending every 4–6 hours in high-risk scenarios, alongside strict fluid balance and weight tracking, because adipsic patients can deteriorate rapidly without thirst compensation [^6585d5d4] [^2ec0a6a0]. But wait, what if access to labs is limited? In that case, temporary dose reduction or omission of desmopressin with careful fluid planning is prudent to avoid iatrogenic hyponatremia, as suggested by Pituitary Society COVID-era guidance for constrained settings [^ba41a87b] [^4d6efc8e].

> Let me consider medication formulation and dose titration. Intranasal desmopressin is acceptable, but absorption can be variable, and switching to oral or sublingual forms may improve consistency and facilitate fixed-dose regimens; dose should be titrated to control polyuria while avoiding hyponatremia, and clinicians should remember the low bioavailability of oral formulations when converting from intranasal therapy [^62c9f89e] [^88e6f081]. I should double-check that any formulation change warrants closer sodium monitoring during the transition to avoid drift [^88e6f081].

> I need to ensure we address special risks and comorbidities. Adipsic patients are at increased risk of obesity, sleep apnea, and thrombotic events during hypernatremia, so screening and management of these conditions should be integrated into longitudinal care, and patients should wear medical identification indicating adipsic diabetes insipidus to expedite appropriate treatment in emergencies [^ee5eaaf1] [^a59333e5] [^2eb9791f]. Hold on, I should verify that emergency teams are alerted; yes, guidelines recommend medical alert identification and communication with caregivers and clinicians about the diagnosis and fluid plan [^2eb9791f].

> Next, I should review patient education and safety netting. Patients must be taught to recognize early symptoms of hypernatremia and hyponatremia, to weigh themselves daily during titration and at least several times weekly once stable, and to adjust fluids strictly per the prescribed weight-based algorithm, with a low threshold to contact clinicians for illness, vomiting, or neurologic changes; this is reinforced by FDA labeling emphasizing hyponatremia risk and the need for fluid discipline and periodic sodium checks [^23e5ffab] [^400af690]. I should confirm that written instructions and a crisis plan are provided and reviewed at each visit to reduce preventable admissions [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize the final, actionable monitoring plan. Outpatient: check serum sodium weekly to every two weeks until stable, then monthly if stable, with daily weights during titration and at least three times weekly thereafter; maintain a fixed desmopressin dose with a fixed daily fluid prescription; adjust fluids by about 1 liter per kilogram of weight change over 24 hours; implement a planned breakthrough diuresis about once weekly with a sodium check within 24–48 hours; and reassess the entire regimen if sodium drifts outside 140–150 mmol/L or if intercurrent illness occurs [^3c99ca3b] [^2eb9791f]. Inpatient or during illness: increase sodium monitoring to every 4–6 hours, track strict intake and output, and coordinate with endocrinology for fluid and desmopressin adjustments, including temporary dose omission if hyponatremia risk is high [^6585d5d4] [^2ec0a6a0].

> Finally, I should confirm that this plan aligns with the evidence hierarchy and is adaptable. The approach is grounded in Endocrine Society guidance, supported by Society for Endocrinology inpatient protocols, and operationalized by contemporary reviews and case-based protocols, with built-in flexibility for formulation changes, illness, and patient-specific factors; I will note that if sodium remains unstable despite adherence, we should reconsider formulation, reassess for occult illness or drug interactions, and consider structured inpatient observation to retune the regimen safely [^2eb9791f] [^6585d5d4] [^1a47fbc3].

For a patient with adipsic diabetes insipidus on desmopressin, **daily weights and strict fluid intake** are essential to prevent dysnatremias, with a fixed daily fluid target of 1.5–2.5 L and adjustment by 500 mL for each 1 kg weight change [^1a47fbc3]. Serum sodium should be checked **weekly until stable**, then monthly, and after any dose change or intercurrent illness; more frequent checks are needed if sodium drifts or symptoms occur [^2eb9791f] [^3c99ca3b]. Educate the patient to recognize hyponatremia/hypernatremia symptoms, maintain a strict fluid schedule, and wear medical alert identification [^2eb9791f]. During illness or surgery, monitor sodium every 4–6 hours and adjust fluids and desmopressin as needed [^6585d5d4] [^2ec0a6a0].

---

## Clinical monitoring

- **Daily weights**: Weigh at the same time each day; adjust fluid intake by 500 mL for each 1 kg change to maintain euvolemia and stable sodium [^1a47fbc3].

- **Strict fluid intake**: Prescribe a fixed daily fluid target (typically 1.5–2.5 L); avoid ad lib intake due to absent thirst [^1a47fbc3].

- **Symptom surveillance**: Monitor for nausea, headache, confusion, lethargy (hyponatremia) or thirst, fatigue, confusion, seizures (hypernatremia) [^notfound].

- **Medical alert**: Ensure the patient wears identification stating adipsic DI and current therapy [^2eb9791f].

---

## Laboratory monitoring

- **Serum sodium**: Check weekly until stable, then monthly; increase frequency if sodium drifts or symptoms occur, and after dose changes or illness [^3c99ca3b].

- **Routine labs**: Periodic serum osmolality, urine osmolality, and urine specific gravity to assess control and adherence [^dcbaaf0f].

- **Intercurrent illness**: During illness, surgery, or hospitalization, monitor sodium every 4–6 hours and adjust fluids and desmopressin as needed [^6585d5d4] [^2ec0a6a0].

---

## Patient education and self-management

Patient education should emphasize **strict adherence** to the fixed fluid prescription and daily weights, with prompt reporting of weight changes > 1 kg or symptoms of dysnatremia. Patients should be taught to recognize early signs of hyponatremia (nausea, headache, confusion) and hypernatremia (thirst, fatigue, confusion) and to seek urgent care if severe symptoms occur. They should also carry emergency information detailing the diagnosis, medications, and contact numbers [^2eb9791f].

---

## Management of dysnatremias

| **Dysnatremia** | **Management** |
|-|-|
| Hypernatremia (> 150 mmol/L) | - Increase fluid intake by 500 mL for each 1 kg weight loss <br/> - Consider desmopressin dose reduction or omission if persistent [^1a47fbc3] [^2eb9791f] |
| Hyponatremia (< 135 mmol/L) | - Reduce fluid intake by 500 mL for each 1 kg weight gain <br/> - Consider desmopressin dose reduction or temporary omission [^1a47fbc3] [^2eb9791f] |

---

## Special considerations

Special considerations include **intercurrent illness**, during which sodium should be monitored every 4–6 hours and fluids and desmopressin adjusted as needed [^6585d5d4] [^2ec0a6a0]. Perioperative management requires close coordination with surgery and anesthesia teams, with frequent sodium checks and a clear fluid/desmopressin plan [^9a7bfcb8] [^2ec0a6a0]. Medication interactions warrant vigilance for drugs that alter fluid balance or sodium (e.g. diuretics, SSRIs, antiepileptics) and prompt dose adjustments [^400af690].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Daily weights**: Same time, adjust fluids by 500 mL per 1 kg change [^1a47fbc3].

- **Fixed fluid intake**: 1.5–2.5 L/day, no ad lib intake [^1a47fbc3].

- **Serum sodium**: Weekly until stable, then monthly; more often if unstable or ill [^3c99ca3b].

- **Patient education**: Strict adherence, symptom recognition, medical alert [^2eb9791f].

- **Illness/surgery**: Monitor sodium every 4–6 hours, adjust therapy as needed [^6585d5d4] [^2ec0a6a0].

---

Effective management of adipsic DI requires **daily weights, fixed fluid intake, and frequent sodium monitoring**, with patient education and proactive adjustments during illness or surgery to prevent recurrent dysnatremias.

### Adipsic diabetes insipidus: a review [^ee5eaaf1]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Adipsic diabetes insipidus (ADI) is a rare disorder consisting of central diabetes insipidus (CDI) and a deficient or absent thirst response to hyperosmolality. Patients with ADI experience marked morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis and management of these patients is quite challenging, even in expert hands. In this review, we aim to provide an updated overview of this difficult clinical scenario.

Methods

We conducted a PubMed search for articles related to ADI. The search terms "adipsia", "adipsic", "thirst", and "diabetes insipidus" were used to identify relevant literature.

Results

ADI has been described in only approximately 100 patients. This rarity has limited the quality and quantity of literature to case reports, case series, and expert opinion. Diagnosis focuses on confirmation of CDI followed by documenting subnormal or completely absent thirst in response to a hypertonic stimulus. Among the described patients with ADI, the majority experience morbidity (e.g., severe hypernatremia, sleep apnea, venous thromboembolism [VTE], and obesity) and an increased mortality risk. Management focuses on frequent reassessment of daily prescribed water intake with fixed antidiuretic therapy (desmopressin) and comorbidity screening.

Conclusion

The complexity of patients with ADI provides a difficult challenge for clinicians. Prompt recognition of thirst disorders in patients with CDI should lead to appropriately regimented management strategies and can result in safe outpatient care for these unique patients.

### Postoperative diabetes insipidus: how to define and grade this complication? [^621434e4]. Pituitary (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment of postoperative DI

Step 1: (Mild) Postoperative DI can initially be treated with adequate water intake; compensating the excretion with equivalent intake. Patients should be encouraged to drink according to thirst to compensate for the fluid loss and prevent hypernatremia.

Step 2: The fluid balance and electrolyte status should be monitored every 3 h to assess if the fluid loss is adequately compensated.

Step 3: When the fluid loss exceeds the patient's ability to drink or causes discomfort, incidental desmopressin, a synthetic vasopressin-analogue, should be administered. In our center, we administer desmopressin orally in 50 to 100 µg doses, but nasal, subcutaneous, and intravenous preparations are also available. However, nasal administration is not appropriate in the postoperative period due to nasal congestion causing absorption impairment. After administration of desmopressin, the fluid balance and electrolyte status of the patient should be monitored every 3 h. Attention should be given to fluctuating severity and the possibility of the development of SIADH.

Patients at risk for adipsic diabetes insipidus

In cases with surgery and hypothalamic involvement and neurological symptoms, there should be additional awareness of the likelihood of adipsic DI as acute changes in osmolality and severe hypernatremia can cause potentially life-threatening situations. In such patients, serum osmolality or serum sodium should be analyzed proactively and frequently (e.g. every 6 h). An additional tool to assess volume depletion in these patients is daily weight measurement. The threshold for administration of desmopressin or iv fluids should be low.

Risk factors for postoperative diabetes insipidus

A limited number of studies reported on an association between preoperative clinical factors and the occurrence of postoperative DI, but a recent systematic review on risk factors for postoperative complications found incongruous results. Some studies describe a higher incidence in Rathke's cleft cysts (RCC), or larger tumors, whereas other studies do not confirm these findings.

### Diagnosis and management of central diabetes insipidus in adults [^840eee58]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a clinical syndrome which results from loss or impaired function of vasopressinergic neurons in the hypothalamus/posterior pituitary, resulting in impaired synthesis and/or secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP). AVP deficiency leads to the inability to concentrate urine and excessive renal water losses, resulting in a clinical syndrome of hypotonic polyuria with compensatory thirst. CDI is caused by diverse etiologies, although it typically develops due to neoplastic, traumatic, or autoimmune destruction of AVP-synthesizing/secreting neurons. This review focuses on the diagnosis and management of CDI, providing insights into the physiological disturbances underpinning the syndrome. Recent developments in diagnostic techniques, particularly the development of the copeptin assay, have improved accuracy and acceptability of the diagnostic approach to the hypotonic polyuria syndrome. We discuss the management of CDI with particular emphasis on management of fluid intake and pharmacological replacement of AVP. Specific clinical syndromes such as adipsic diabetes insipidus and diabetes insipidus in pregnancy as well as management of the perioperative patient with diabetes insipidus are also discussed.

Monitoring

All patients who have undergone pituitary surgery should have close monitoring postoperatively, including fluid intake and urine output, thirst, and daily electrolyte monitoring. If polyuria occurs, clinical review of symptomatic thirst, hydration status, and fluid balance, and biochemical investigation with urine specific gravity, plasma sodium, and paired serum and urine osmolality should be performed. For patients who develop AVP-D, electrolytes should be monitored twice daily until resolution or stabilization (42,44). Patients with adipsic AVP-D, reduced consciousness, or impaired thirst require closer monitoring, and plasma electrolytes should be performed more frequently (eg, every 6 hours) (45,46).

Management of DI

In this section, we present the algorithm for diagnosis and treatment of postoperative DI that was reached consensus on at a local level to aid centers that do not have an operational protocol or are yet in the process of developing one. We would like to stress that the diagnostic and treatment process is complex and is both patient and situation dependent. Other centers might use different or adjusted protocols to satisfaction and with similar treatment results. Ideally, a consensus meeting between expert centers or within networks (as Endo-ERN) would be planned to take this further towards a general guideline for postoperative DI.

Diagnosis of postoperative DI (Fig. 1)

Fluid balance should continuously be monitored at six-hour intervals after surgery. A three-hour interval should be used in patients at high risk for DI or experiencing a current episode of DI (see Fig. 1). Specific attention should be given to the fluid balance during transfers between locations (e.g. from the operation room to the recovery room, recovery room to ward, intensive care unit to ward). Furthermore, unnecessary perioperative fluid administration of in the holding or operation room should be discouraged. As glucocorticoids suppress vasopressin release DI in patients with new adrenal insufficiency without glucocorticoid treatment may not become manifest and underestimated. Specific attention should be given to patients in which glucocorticoid treatment is initiated as an episode of DI may be "unmasked".

These recommendations have led to the following assessment scheme for polyuria (> 300 mL for > 3 consecutive hours), which follows a step-wise approach:
Assessment of urine specific gravity in each urine portion (see Table 1)
If USG is < 1005, assess the presence of unquenchable thirst, preferably with the NRS and measure serum osmolality and/or serum sodium concentration.
In case of unquenchable thirst and/or an increased serum sodium concentration (> 145 mmol/L): diagnose postoperative DI, and treat accordingly (see next paragraph).
Repeat the assessment as stated above every 3 h until the urine production normalizes.

2.1 Pretreatment Testing and On-Treatment Monitoring

Diabetes Insipidus

Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality. Intermittently during treatment, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality or plasma osmolality.

Hemophilia A

Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are > 5% and exclude the presence of factor VIII autoantibodies. Also assess serum sodium and aPTT prior to treatment. In certain clinical situations, it may be justified to try desmopressin acetate in patients with factor VIII levels between 2% to 5%; however, these patients should be carefully monitored.

von Willebrand's Disease (Type I)

Prior to treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are > 5% and exclude severe von Willebrand's disease (Type I) and presence of abnormal molecular form of factor VIII antigen. During treatment with desmopressin acetate injection, assess serum sodium, bleeding time, factor VIII coagulant activity, ristocetin cofactor activity, and von Willebrand antigen to ensure that adequate levels are being achieved.

For All Patients Receiving Repeated Doses: Restrict free water intake and monitor for hyponatremia.

Ensure that serum sodium is normal prior to initiating or resuming treatment with desmopressin acetate injection.

Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with the following conditions due to an increased risk of hyponatremia: · Moderate to severe renal impairment defined as a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min. Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with the following conditions because fluid retention increases the risk of worsening the underlying condition: · Heart failure · Uncontrolled hypertension Desmopressin acetate injection can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death. Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia, with excessive fluid intake, using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, with known or suspected SIADH, and/or illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances. Avoid concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia. Prior to starting or resuming desmopressin acetate injection, ensure that the serum sodium concentration is normal. Limit fluid intake to a minimum from 1 hour before administration until 8 hours after administration. Use of desmopressin acetate injection without concomitant reduction of fluid intake may lead to fluid retention and hyponatremia. Monitor the serum sodium concentration within 1 week and approximately 1 month of initiating desmopressin acetate injection, and periodically thereafter. Base the frequency of serum sodium monitoring on the patient's risk of hyponatremia.

anti-inflammatory drugs, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, thiazide diuretics and chlorpropamide), and patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may drink excessive amounts of water, may be at increased risk of hyponatremia. If hyponatremia occurs, desmopressin acetate injection may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued and treatment for the hyponatremia instituted, depending on the clinical circumstances, including the duration and severity of the hyponatremia. Desmopressin acetate may cause hypotension or hypertension. Monitor blood pressure during desmopressin acetate administration, particularly in patients with a history of coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease.

Desmopressin acetate injection can cause fluid retention, which can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Patients with heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension may be at increased risk. Desmopressin acetate injection is not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or those with a history of urinary retention. Advise patients to limit fluid intake. Nervous: Headache, hyponatremic seizures The concomitant administration of desmopressin acetate injection with other drugs that may increase the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia, requires more frequent serum sodium monitoring.

### Adipsic arginine vasopressin deficiency: challenges in managing the intricate interplay of adipsia with polyuria [^3c99ca3b]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Adipsic arginine vasopressin deficiency (AAVP-D) is caused by hypothalamic dysfunction (HD) due to varied aetiologies, including craniopharyngiomas. Its management is extremely challenging because two of the three regulatory mechanisms (thirst, arginine vasopressin, and renal medullary tonicity) for maintaining plasma osmolality are impaired (thirst, arginine vasopressin). These individuals develop severe dehydration and hypernatraemia, necessitating multiple emergency visits despite the administration of arginine vasopressin analogue (desmopressin). Here, we describe a case with HD secondary to craniopharyngioma treatment manifesting as AAVP-D, short stature, central hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism and probable hypogonadism. AAVP-D was managed by fixing the renal water losses (using desmopressin) and water intake in a predetermined range. The treatment monitoring was done using total body weight and weekly to fortnightly serum sodium. Using this approach, the serum sodium was maintained in the range of 140-150mmol/L, and there were no emergency visits for hypernatraemia or hyponatraemia (dysnatraemia) at 3months.

Adipsic diabetes insipidus is an infrequent disease which may be associated with craniopharyngioma. It may be secondary to the tumour's extension, as well as to resection of the mass. We present the case of a 24-year-old woman with a history of delayed puberty and hypothyroidism, but no prior study reports. She consulted due to a headache with warning signs associated with altered visual acuity. Brain MRI was performed which showed signs of a non-adenomatous lesion with suprasellar and hypothalamic extension. Following transcranial surgery, she developed diabetes insipidus criteria, with absence of thirst documented during the hospitalisation. The histopathological findings confirmed the diagnosis of craniopharyngioma. The patient was treated with desmopressin and received recommendations regarding rehydration according to the quantification of losses, with electrolyte stabilisation.

Diabetes insipidus — desmopressin (DDAVP) formulations, absorption, and dosing considerations include that clinicians can administer DDAVP sc, orally, intranasally, or sublingually as a melt, and in all forms clinicians must carefully monitor treatment to prevent overdosing. Oral and sublingual absorption rates are < 1%, whereas intranasal is approximately 6%; oral DDAVP is available in 100-, 200-, and, in some countries, 400-μg tablets; sublingual melts and nasal preparations include a spray (usually 10 μg per spray) and a rhinal tube with a dose range of 1–10 μg; and the mean dose ratio of sublingual to intranasal DDAVP is 1:24. About one-fourth of DI patients with an intact thirst mechanism treated with DDAVP have mild hyponatremia, and clinicians must individualize and tailor treatments to meet patient requirements and practical needs.

### Adipsic diabetes insipidus in adult patients [^8fd98fc5]. Pituitary (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Adipsic diabetes insipidus (ADI) is a very rare disorder, characterized by hypotonic polyuria due to arginine vasopressin (AVP) deficiency and failure to generate the sensation of thirst in response to hypernatraemia. As the sensation of thirst is the key homeostatic mechanism that prevents hypernatraemic dehydration in patients with untreated diabetes insipidus (DI), adipsia leads to failure to respond to aquaresis with appropriate fluid intake. This predisposes to the development of significant hypernatraemia, which is the typical biochemical manifestation of adipsic DI.

Methods

A literature search was performed to review the background, etiology, management and associated complications of this rare condition.

Results

ADI has been reported to occur in association with clipping of an anterior communicating artery aneurysm following subarachnoid haemorrhage, major hypothalamic surgery, traumatic brain injury and toluene exposure among other conditions. Management is very difficult and patients are prone to marked changes in plasma sodium concentration, in particular to the development of severe hypernatraemia. Associated hypothalamic disorders, such as severe obesity, sleep apnoea and thermoregulatory disorders are often observed in patients with ADI.

Conclusion

The management of ADI is challenging and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Prognosis is variable; hypothalamic complications lead to early death in some patients, but recent reports highlight the possibility of recovery of thirst.

### Desmopressin administration in children with central diabetes insipidus: a retrospective review [^d6d791d7]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Central diabetes insipidus (DI) is a rare disorder in children caused by a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone arginine (vasopressin). Desmopressin is the first line agent in management of central DI. However, one of the side effects of desmopressin is water intoxication and hyponatraemia. This study reviews the patterns of desmopressin use and side effects in our institution.

Methods

Retrospective chart review of all patients with central DI followed up in one tertiary centre between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2010.

Results

Forty-one patients (22 males and 19 females) were included. Twelve patients (29.3%) had congenital and 29 patients (70.7%) had acquired DI, mostly as a result of intracranial tumours. Thirty-six (87.8%) patients were on oral desmopressin and the remaining on nasal formulation. The median oral dose was 9.5 (4.2–17.0) μg/kg/day with median frequency of 2.5 (2–3). The median nasal dose was 0.7 (0.4–1.4) μg/kg/day with median frequency of 2.0 (2–3.5). Fourteen patients (34.1%) were switched from nasal to oral desmopressin with the median dose conversion factor of 20.1 (10.7–31.8). Forty percent of patients on nasal desmopressin experienced hypo/hypernatraemia compared to 18.1% on oral, however, there were no significance difference between standardized hypo/hypernatraemia episodes per treatment year.

Conclusions

Oral desmopressin is used in the majority of our patients including infants and toddlers. There is wide inter-individual variation in dose requirement and dosing intervals. Management of central diabetes insipidus remains a challenge in adipsic patients and in young children during intercurrent illness regardless of the desmopressin formulation.

### Desmopressin dose requirements in patients with permanent arginine vasopressin deficiency: a tertiary center experience [^deeeb380]. Pituitary (2024). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic monitoring of subjects with AVP deficiency entails periodic measurement of serum sodium (s-Na) levels, with the aim of maintaining electrolytes within the desired range, as well as alleviating the often debilitating symptoms associated with polyuria, primarily by addressing nocturia.

One of the potentially most severe side effects associated with chronic desmopressin therapy, indeed, is dilutional hyponatremia, as the synthetic hormone is unable to regulate finely in response to any excess water intake like the native peptide. Consequently, a strategy proposed by several authors is that of desmopressin escape, suggesting to the patient to periodically omit or delay therapy intake until the reoccurrence of polyuria.

Chronic desmopressin therapy can be administered either orally (tablets), sublingually (oral lyophilizate), or intranasally (spray or drops), and the daily medication dose often varies among different patients. In this regard, few studies to date have evaluated the needs for dDAVP dose requirement in adult or pediatric subjects, with inconsistent findings. In fact, while some studies have observed a modest correlation between either age or body mass index (BMI) and daily desmopressin dose, this finding was not confirmed by all studies. Similarly, the study by Pedersen et al. reported a higher dose in subjects with congenital forms compared to patients with acquired forms, whereas the exact opposite was reported by Almutlaq and colleagues.

Moreover, in this regard, it is important to consider that the available evidence in the literature has usually determined the required dDAVP daily dose based only on the current dose at the last follow-up, which does not always represent the patient's actual need from both a clinical and biochemical perspective.

All this considered, the aim of our study was to evaluate the desmopressin dose requirements in a large cohort of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of AVP deficiency, who have good and stable clinical and biochemical control, in order to identify predictors of such dose requirements.

Problems, Approaches, and Solutions With Disorders of Thirst Sense

In normal physiology, thirst is stimulated in a linear fashion with increasing plasma osmolalities above 280 mOsm/kg. Patients with AVP-D and an intact thirst sense manage well when on desmopressin by drinking to thirst, usually maintaining their serum sodium the normal range. In some patients with AVP-D, the thirst sense is not fully normal (dysdipsic) or occasionally absent (adipsic), making water balance and maintenance of normonatremia more challenging. Disorders of thirst regulation are more likely with larger destructive hypothalamic lesions and pathology (for example craniopharyngioma) that destroy the hypothalamic osmoreceptors located in the anterior wall of the hypothalamus.

Assessing thirst is a crucial part of the overall assessment of the patient with hypotonic polyuria. This is most effectively done using a visual analogue diagram with the patient rating their thirst on a 1 (least) to 10 (most) thirst scale. If thirst sense is not in the high range when plasma osmolality is elevated (for example at the end of a hypertonic saline infusion or if fasting plasma osmolality is elevated), the patient has dysregulated thirst. Knowledge of this is important, as greater levels of patient education are needed about the volume of fluid intake, allowing for environmental factors such as heat and altitude. Such an approach is exemplified by the patient with true adipsic AVP-D, which can be one of the most challenging of all conditions in clinical endocrinology to manage. In this situation, patients need to take a fixed dose of desmopressin and a fixed volume of water/fluid per day defined by their weight when plasma osmolality and sodium are normal. The patient then weighs themselves once or twice a day, and the fluid volume is adjusted over the ensuing 24 hours — increased or decreased by the same volume in liters as the weight change in kilograms. Regardless of weight maintenance, any change in neurocognitive function necessitates measuring the serum sodium concentration to avoid both hyponatremia and hypernatremia. An alternative is frequent point-of-care testing for serum sodium concentration, where this is available and affordable.

### Postoperative diabetes insipidus: how to define and grade this complication? [^ee8e88c0]. Pituitary (2021). Medium credibility.

Diabetes insipidus

Central DI is a condition characterized by the inability to sufficiently concentrate urine due to impaired vasopressin release and can be caused by injury to the posterior pituitary gland, pituitary stalk or hypothalamus. DI will lead to extreme thirst, most typically for cold water, to compensate for the fluid loss. When fluid loss exceeds the patient's ability to drink dehydration and hypernatremia may occur.

Adipsic DI can occur in patients with an impaired sense of thirst. Adipsic DI is extremely rare and is most likely caused by hypothalamic damage and can occur after extensive surgery in the hypothalamic region, which is more often seen in patients with large craniopharyngiomas and giant adenomas. These patients do not feel an urge to compensate for the fluid loss by drinking water; adipsic DI renders the patient at risk of hypernatremia and severe dehydration.

Postoperative DI may be transient or permanent. Transient DI typically occurs within 24–48 h after surgery and resolves during the next couple of days. It is most likely caused by mild and reversible injury to the pituitary stalk or posterior pituitary lobe. Permanent DI occurs when the hypothalamus and/or pituitary stalk are irreversibly injured.

Postoperative DI can occur in combination with an episode of the Syndrome of Inappropriate ADH-secretion (SIADH). SIADH occurs as injured neurons of the hypothalamo-pituitary tract degenerate and release all stored vasopressin and most typically becomes manifest 5–8 days postoperative as it takes time for neurons to fully degenerate. SIADH renders patients receiving desmopressin treatment for preceding DI prone for hyponatremia. In the biphasic pattern, normal fluid balance is restored after the episode of SIADH (DI-SIADH-normal fluid homeostasis). In case no restoration to the posterior pituitary tract has occurred, the typical, but rare, triphasic pattern occurs and (permanent) DI will resume (DI-SIADH-DI).

Proposed definition for diagnosis of DI and rationale for this proposition

Mandatory criterium: polyuria (urinary output > 300 ml/h for 3 h) AND urine specific gravity (USG) < 1.005, in addition to at least one relative criterion: excessive thirst, serum osmolality > 300 mosmol/kg or serum sodium > 145 mmol/L (Box 1).

### Approach to the patient: "Utility of the copeptin assay" [^fc734c2f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Utility of Copeptin Measurement in Hyper- and Hyponatremia

Copeptin Measurement in Hypernatremia

While hypernatremia is a rare finding in outpatients, it is much more common in hospitalized patients showing a prevalence of 2% to 3%. Hypernatremia results from a free water deficit due to renal (central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, glycosuria) or extrarenal water loss or from iatrogenic sodium overload (eg, uncontrolled saline infusion, tube feeding). In the majority of hospitalized hypernatremia patients, the electrolyte imbalance is not present at admission, but develops during hospitalization. Besides iatrogenic issues, many other factors and comorbidities such as heart failure, chronic kidney disease, sepsis, neurological impairment with impaired thirst perception, or inability to drink may promote the development of hypernatremia in the acute setting. Hypernatremia is therefore also a marker of disease severity and, unsurprisingly, studies consistently report increased mortality rates in patients with hypernatremia.

The most important measure to correct hypernatremia is to increase the free water supply, such as by intravenous hypotonic infusion. Additionally, in salt-overloaded patients iatrogenic action has to be stopped and diabetes insipidus patients need timely treatment with desmopressin.

The high rate of hospital-acquired hypernatremia underpins insufficient hypernatremia awareness in hospitalized patients, with the result of inadequate treatment and worse outcome. Specifically, for hospitalized patients with diabetes insipidus, a retrospective audit showed that desmopressin treatment was delayed in 88% of patients at admission, putting them at risk of hypernatremia. This prompted the Society for Endocrinology to publish guidelines on in-hospital management of central diabetes insipidus in 2018. For patients with undiagnosed diabetes insipidus who are also at need for early desmopressin treatment, copeptin has been proposed as a readily available diagnostic marker in the acute setting.

Potential organ donor — desmopressin (1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin) for diabetes insipidus (DI) is described with dosing and monitoring: An initial desmopressin dose of 1–4 µg is administered IV, with close monitoring of urine osmolality, volume (goal < 4 mL/kg/hr), and serum sodium; when dilute urine output increases, an additional dose is recommended, and typically 1–2 μg IV are required every 6 hours. Although the recommended dosing to induce procoagulant effects is significantly higher (0.3 µg/kg), data from human studies are conflicting regarding thrombogenic risk; a retrospective review of the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database of over 2,800 patients found increased pancreatic graft thrombosis (5.1%) vs 3.1% without desmopressin. Both AVP and desmopressin can be administered concurrently in donors with significant hypernatremia and hypotension.

### Clinical review: treatment of neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus [^dfcb4ba9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

In recent years, there have been several improvements in the treatment of neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (DI). They include new formulations of the vasopressin analog, desmopressin; a better understanding of the effect of fluid intake on dosing; and more information about treatments of infants, children, and pregnant women who present special challenges. This review aims to summarize past and current information relative to the safety and efficacy of treatments for the types of DI caused by a primary deficiency of vasopressin.

Evidence Acquisition

The review is based on publications identified primarily by a PubMed search of the international literature without limitations of date.

Evidence Synthesis

In acute settings where fluid intake is determined by factors other than thirst, desmopressin should be given iv in doses that have a short duration of action and can be adjusted quickly in accordance with changes in hydration as indicated by plasma sodium. In ambulatory patients, the oral formulations (tablet or melt) are preferred for their convenience. If fluid intake is regulated normally by the thirst mechanism, the tablets or melt can be taken safely 1 to 3 times a day in doses sufficient to completely eliminate the polyuria. However, if fluid intake consistently exceeds replacement needs as evidenced by the development of hyponatremia, the dose should be reduced to allow higher than normal rates of urine output or intermittent breakthrough diuresis. This regimen is often indicated in infants or children because their rate of fluid intake tends to be greater than in adults. In all cases, the appropriate dose should be determined by titration, owing to considerable interindividual differences in bioavailability and antidiuretic effect.

Conclusions

Desmopressin can provide effective and safe therapy for all patients with neurohypophyseal or gestational DI if given in doses and by a route that takes into account the determinants of fluid intake.

### SARS-CoV-2 infection and paediatric endocrine disorders: risks and management considerations [^cfb4197e]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

4 MANAGEMENT OF ENDOCRINE DISORDERS IN CHILDREN IN THE COVID ERA

Management considerations for children and adolescents with underlying endocrine disorders, including those who develop COVID‐19 disease, is highlighted below. Special consideration should be given to prevent COVID‐19 infection in at risk populations. Approaches to management and treatment of paediatric endocrine disorders may have to be modified to decrease contact with healthcare team.

4.1 Hypopituitarism

Children with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies may be at increased risk for COVID‐19 complications and mortality, particularly if central AI is not managed adequately. In the absence of published data or guidelines, we recommend following established practices for managing pituitary hormone deficiencies in children. Current guidance for adults with growth hormone deficiency recommends stopping growth hormone during hospitalization with COVID‐19; however, there is a lack of data regarding the effects of growth hormone treatment during COVID‐19 disease in children. Management of adrenal insufficiency is addressed below.

4.2 Central diabetes insipidus

Recommendations for management of central diabetes insipidus in patients with mild COVID‐19 disease do not vary from usual recommendations for management of diabetes insipidus in the home setting. However, patients of all ages with diabetes insipidus are at risk of disturbed sodium balance during hospitalization and must be monitored closely. Hypernatraemia can be caused by failure to administer free water to patients who are unable to care for themselves, and inability to rely on thirst mechanism in critically ill patients. Patients are also vulnerable to hyponatraemia due to overtreatment of DI and excess ADH in the setting of COVID‐19 pneumonia. Treatment of DI with subcutaneous or oral desmopressin rather than intranasal desmopressin should be considered if there is concern for nasal congestion. In patients with severe COVID‐19 illness, desmopressin should be administered intravenously. Urine osmolality and volume should be monitored, and serum sodium should be measured at frequent intervals (every 2–4 h) to help maintain eunatraemia. Patients with COVID‐19 may have severe respiratory disease including pulmonary oedema, as hypernatraemia has not been implicated as a risk factor for mortality in COVID‐19, mild hypernatraemia may need to be tolerated under these circumstances to prevent pulmonary oedema.

### Approach to the patient with suspected hypotonic polyuria [^bebc64b7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

It is common for endocrinologists to receive referred patients who have polyuria and polydipsia that need investigation. When initial investigations reveal the urine to be hypotonic, differentiating between the 3 main causes is essential, as the management differs for each. Over the past 2 years, due to concerns about patient safety and in response to patient feedback, the causes of hypotonic polyuria have been renamed as arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D, formerly central diabetes insipidus), arginine vasopressin resistance (AVP-R, formerly nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), while the name of the third cause is retained as primary polydipsia (PP), in which excess fluid intake suppresses AVP secretion. In a survey of more than one thousand patients with AVP-D, the large majority had experienced confusion of their condition by health care workers with diabetes mellitus, resulting in delays in availability of desmopressin and unnecessary capillary glucose monitoring when hospitalized, and 85% favored changing the name. The new nomenclature more accurately reflects pathophysiology and clearly identifies the patients' condition as different from diabetes mellitus, and now has been adopted by the Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) taxonomy hierarchy codes for electronic patient records. In parallel, the last several years have seen improvements in the diagnostic tools used for the investigation of hypotonic polyuria, with a particular emphasis on the use of measurement of plasma copeptin. This Approach to the Patient review presents the use of this copeptin-based approach in 3 specific cases, and places each in the context of the revised nomenclature. We then describe the overall approach to the patient presenting with hypotonic polyuria, itemize the causes, and discuss when and how testing should be performed (Fig. 1), highlighting specific areas that frequently cause diagnostic and management difficulties.

### Clinical insights into adipsic diabetes insipidus: a large case series [^a59333e5]. Clinical Endocrinology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Adipsic diabetes insipidus (DI) causes significant hypernatraemia. Morbidity and mortality data for patients with adipsic DI have been previously published as single case reports, rather than as formal trials or case series from units with established management protocols. Our objective was to describe morbidity and mortality in patients with adipsic DI attending a tertiary referral centre, representing the largest reported series of adipsic DI, and to suggest management protocols for such patients, based on our extensive experience of this condition.

Design

Arginine vasopressin (AVP) responses to hypotension were recorded during trimetaphan infusion. Sleep abnormalities were identified using overnight oximetry or polysomnography. Case-note analysis defined other clinical abnormalities including seizures and thrombotic episodes. Important clinical points for the management of these patients are highlighted.

Patients

Thirteen patients with adipsic DI defined by thirst and plasma AVP responses to hypertonic saline infusion.

Results

All patients had absent AVP and thirst responses to osmotic stimulation, with subnormal water intake. Five patients had absent AVP responses to hypotension; the remainder had normal responses. Eight patients were obese [body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m²], and three were overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m²). Seven patients had sleep apnoea, of whom three died at 36 years or younger. Four patients developed venous thrombosis during episodes of hypernatraemia. Two patients had thermoregulatory dysfunction and seven patients had seizure activity.

Conclusion

Adipsic DI is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Physicians should be aware of associated, treatable hypothalamic abnormalities such as obesity, sleep apnoea, seizures and thermoregulatory disorders when managing adipsic DI.

Hypopituitarism during COVID-19 — clinicians should remain vigilant given increased background mortality and management trade-offs. Patients with hypopituitarism have increased mortality, particularly from cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease, which is an important risk factor for COVID-19 disease severity. There is a careful balance between preventing adrenal insufficiency and avoiding prolonged glucocorticoid over-replacement with consequent immunosuppression. Diabetes insipidus poses fluid-balance challenges during significant illness, and hypernatremia is linked to increased mortality in intensive care admissions.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE.

1. 1 Central Diabetes Insipidus Desmopressin acetate injection is indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central diabetes insipidus and for the management of the temporary polyuria and polydipsia following head trauma or surgery in the pituitary region. Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with the following conditions due to an increased risk of hyponatremia: · Moderate to severe renal impairment defined as a creatinine clearance below 50. · Concomitant use with systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids. · During illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance, such as gastroenteritis, salt-wasting nephropathies, or systemic infection.

Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with the following conditions because fluid retention increases the risk of worsening the underlying condition: respiratory arrest, or death. Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia, with excessive fluid intake, using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, with known or suspected SIADH, and/or. illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances. Avoid concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia. Prior to starting or resuming desmopressin acetate injection, ensure that the serum sodium concentration is normal. Limit fluid intake to a minimum from 1 hour before. administration until 8 hours after administration.

2.2 Recommended Dosage

Initiate fluid restriction during treatment with desmopressin acetate injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)].

Diabetes Insipidus:

Treatment naïve patients: The recommended starting daily dosage is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Do not dilute desmopressin acetate injection for the Diabetes Insipidus population. The morning and evening doses should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Adjust dose based upon response to treatment estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover.

Patients changing from intranasal desmopressin: The recommended starting dose of desmopressin acetate injection is 1/10ththe daily maintenance intranasal dose administered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection as one or two divided doses.

Hemophilia A and von Willebrand's Disease (Type I):

The recommended dosage is 0.3 mcg/kg actual body weight (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. If used preoperatively, administer 30 minutes prior to the procedure. If used to reduce spontaneous or traumatic bleeding, doses may be repeated after 8 hours to 12 hours and once daily thereafter, if needed, based upon clinical condition and von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels. The necessity for repeat administration of desmopressin acetate or use of any blood products for hemostasis should be determined by laboratory response as well as the clinical condition of the patient.

Tachyphylaxis (lessening of response) with repeated administration (i.e., given more frequently than every 48 hours) may occur. The initial response is reproducible if desmopressin acetate is administered every 2 to 3 days.

2.3 Preparation and Administration for Patients with Hemophilia A and von Willebrand's Disease (Type I)

Prepare the solution for infusion using aseptic technique. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Withdraw the necessary volume of desmopressin acetate injection from the vial and dilute by adding to the infusion bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP per Table 1. Dilute desmopressin acetate injection in sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and infuse slowly over 15 minutes to 30 minutes.

The volume of diluent is weight-based. See Table 1 for volume of diluent to use.

### Hyponatraemia-treatment standard 2024 [^09dfc4bb]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyponatraemia is the most common electrolyte disorder in hospital patients associated with increased morbidity, mortality, hospital stay and financial burden. The speed of a correction with 3% sodium chloride as a 100- to 150-ml intravenous bolus or continuous infusion depends on the severity and persistence of the symptoms and needs frequent biochemical monitoring. The rapid intermittent administration of hypertonic saline is preferred for treatment of symptomatic hyponatraemia. In asymptomatic mild hyponatraemia, an adequate solute intake with an initial fluid restriction (FR) of 500 ml/day adjusted according to the serum sodium (sNa) levels is preferred. Almost half of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) patients do not respond to FR as first-line therapy. At present, urea and tolvaptan are considered the most effective second-line therapies in SIADH. However, the evidence for guidance on the choice of second-line therapy of hypotonic hyponatraemia is lacking. Oral urea is considered to be a very effective and safe treatment. Mild and asymptomatic hyponatraemia is treated with adequate solute intake (salt and protein) and initial FR with adjustments based on sNa levels. Specific treatment with vaptans may be considered in either euvolaemic or hypervolaemic patients with high ADH activity. In order to ensure optimal patient outcome, close monitoring and readiness for administration of either hypotonic fluids or desmopressin may be crucial in the decision-making process for specific treatment and eventual overcorrection consequences. According to the guidelines, gradual correction and clinical evaluation is preferable over rapid normalization of sNa towards the laboratory reference ranges.

### Pituitary society Delphi survey: an international perspective on endocrine management of patients undergoing transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas [^e7e662b1]. Pituitary (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, a Delphi process was used towards building consensus on endocrine aspects of perioperative evaluation and management of adults undergoing transsphenoidal surgery.

After two rounds of Delphi, panelists from Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, and South America reached consensus on the majority of items submitted to them by the research team. There was wide agreement on the extent of preoperative and postoperative endocrine testing. Despite some uncertainties in previous guidelines, a clear consensus was achieved in this group to measure serum IGF-I in all pituitary tumors preoperatively to ensure proper diagnosis of GH excess. This is important because patients with GH-secreting adenomas do not always present with classic manifestations of acromegaly, require additional evaluation for comorbidities and may benefit from further medical therapy.

There was agreement on preoperative administration of glucocorticoid and thyroid hormone replacement in patients with diagnosed deficiencies as well as perioperative use of stress-dose glucocorticoid coverage for patients with known or suspected hypoadrenalism, but not for all patients undergoing transsphenoidal surgery. The panelists also agreed on postoperative monitoring of serum sodium and cortisol and the use of desmopressin "on demand" (as required to control hypernatremia and/or polyuria) for patients with central diabetes insipidus. Agreement was achieved on postoperative monitoring of endocrine function, including morning serum cortisol in patients with Cushing's disease, as well as serum IGF-I in patients with acromegaly.

Table 1.
Water deprivation test of case patient

At the 3-month follow-up visit, the patient was happy with the desmopressin treatment, under which his thirst sensation had decreased and he had normalized his fluid intake. Repeated plasma sodium levels were between 140 and 142 mmol/L.

Six months after starting desmopressin treatment, the patient presented as an emergency with severely reduced wellbeing with constant headache, vertigo, tiredness, and nausea. Due to a renewed increase in thirst with subsequent increased fluid intake of up to 7 L per day, he had doubled his desmopressin dose. Laboratory analyses showed hypotonic hyponatremia with plasma sodium of 126 mmol/L and plasma osmolality of 256 mosm/kg. After stopping desmopressin, the symptoms ameliorated quickly and sodium levels normalized. Two weeks later, however, the patient wanted to resume desmopressin treatment because he experienced a severe feeling of thirst with accompanying polyuria and polydipsia. What is the patient's diagnosis now? Should desmopressin be resumed? Are there additional tests to address these questions? The following mini-review will address these and other questions. The patient's subsequent course will be described at the end.

### Non-functioning pituitary adenomas: indications for pituitary surgery and post-surgical management [^e1b6acbc]. Pituitary (2019). Medium credibility.

Diabetes insipidus

DI occurs in 18–31% of patients after pituitary surgery. Several factors are associated with the increased risk of postoperative DI, including male sex, young age, large pituitary mass, CSF leak, and administration of high perioperative glucocorticoid doses. In most patients, the disease is transient, being caused by the temporary dysfunction of ADH-secreting neurons. It usually occurs 24–48 h postoperatively and resolves when ADH-secreting cells recover their normal function.

Triphasic DI occurs in 3–4% of patients. The first phase is characterized by DI (usually 5–7 days) due to a partial or complete posterior pituitary dysfunction. The second phase is caused by an uncontrolled release of ADH leading to SIADH, which usually lasts 2–14 days. Finally, the last phase occurs if > 80–90% of the ADH-secreting cells have degenerated, which leads to permanent DI.

Postoperative DI should be suspected if polyuria (≥ 3 L per day) and polydipsia occur in combination with low urine osmolality. Serum hyperosmolality and hypernatremia strongly support the diagnosis of DI. In this clinical context, a water deprivation test is not needed. A urine osmolality < 300 mOsm/kg and subsequent positive response to ADH confirms the diagnosis of central DI.

In patients who are able to drink in response to thirst and when sodium levels remain within the normal range, no treatment is needed. In other cases, treatment with desmopressin may be required. In treated patients, urine output and osmolality, as well as serum sodium levels, should be monitored regularly to avoid hyponatremia. Because postoperative DI can be transient, each dose of desmopressin should be administered after the recurrence of polyuria and thirst. This approach allows recognition of restored ADH secretion and transient DI in the early and late postoperative phases.

### Postoperative diabetes insipidus: how to define and grade this complication? [^8cb58a44]. Pituitary (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pituitary tumors require specialized care in particular for surgical management. Centralization of care for patients with a pituitary tumor in Pituitary Centers of Excellence that deal with high surgical volumes and harbor multidisciplinary teams is advocated to minimize disease- and treatment-related morbidity. Local audits within treatment facilities, but also comparison of treatment results and complications between centers, hold the promise for future quality assurance. Uniform application of the same definitions is mandatory to reliably measure and compare outcomes. However, establishing uniform definitions is challenging, especially for early postoperative complications such as diabetes insipidus (DI) and postoperative hyponatremia.

Postoperative DI is caused by vasopressin deficiency and is one of the most reported complications after pituitary tumor surgery. While in the future measurement of copeptin might be a viable alternative to vasopressin measurement and diagnose DI, to date, diagnosis of DI is based on clinical and indirect laboratory findings as serum vasopressin measurement is expensive and results are not available within the time frame necessary in this setting. The majority of studies reporting on the incidence of postoperative DI do not provide uniform definitions. There is variation in the use of clinical and biochemical parameters which limits reliable comparisons between studies (Table 1) and results in reported incidence range between 2 and 54%. Although there is evidence on the etiology, prevalence numbers, variety of DI patterns, predisposing factors, and treatment of postoperative diabetes insipidus, a formal and widely used definition or consensus statement is not yet available.

Hypopituitarism diagnosis — initial testing and thresholds include early morning fasted pituitary profiles, prioritized screening for diabetes insipidus (DI), and cortisol cutoffs for adrenal insufficiency (AI). An early morning fasted pituitary profile should be arranged, and if DI is strongly suspected, a non-fasted morning blood sample for serum sodium and osmolality should be collected first because patients with complete DI often present with hypernatremia, avoiding the need for a protracted water deprivation test. For AI, a cortisol level < 3 µg/dL indicates AI while a cortisol level > 15 µg/dL reliably excludes AI, with dynamic testing ordinarily used for intermediate results but possibly delayed during the pandemic. Central hypothyroidism is suggested by a low free T4 with low/normal TSH, and central hypogonadism is suggested by low serum testosterone with low/normal gonadotrophins in non-obese males or low estradiol with low/normal gonadotrophins in pre-menopausal women with amenorrhea or in post-menopausal females.

### Adipsic diabetes insipidus following pituitary surgery for a macroprolactinoma [^6b5bacdc]. Pituitary (2006). Low credibility.

Adipsic diabetes insipidus (ADI) is a rare condition in which thirst, an essential clinical feature for the prevention of hypernatraemic dehydration, is absent. We report the first case of adipsic diabetes insipidus to occur following surgery for a pituitary macroprolactinoma, with loss of both osmoregulated and baroregulated vasopressin release. Following extensive surgery for a vision threatening macroprolactinoma a 14-year-old boy developed profound hypernatraemia with absent thirst sensation. Detailed investigation, with hypertonic saline infusion and trimetaphan infusion, revealed absence of both osmoregulatory and baroregulatory release of vasopressin. We discuss the investigation and management of such patients and the physiology of hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal dysfunction in such patients.

Copeptin Based Tests to Differentiate Diabetes Insipidus From Primary Polydipsia

Given the different etiologies of these disorders, there are major differences in treatment. For example, while central diabetes insipidus is mainly treated with exogenous AVP (desmopressin), patients with primary polydipsia are advised to slowly reduce their fluid intake. Therefore, a diagnostic test with high diagnostic accuracy is crucial to avoid wrong treatment decisions. While the standard water deprivation test as described for our patient has been the diagnostic gold standard for decades despite its low diagnostic accuracy of only 70%, recent evaluations showed improved diagnostic accuracy for copeptin based tests.

The easiest etiology to diagnose is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, since copeptin measurements of these patients revealed consistently high levels. In fact, it has been shown that using an unstimulated copeptin cut-off of > 21.4 pmol/L had a 100% sensitivity and specificity to diagnose nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Accordingly, no further evaluations than a random copeptin measurement are needed in these patients.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^0373a245]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte-free water administration (eg, oral water, or IV 5% dextrose) is critical in managing overcorrection. The European guidelines recommend a bolus of 10 mL/kg of electrolyte-free water over 1 hour (eg, 500–1000 mL over 1 h for patients 50–100 kg). International expert panel guidelines recommend commencing an infusion of 3 mL/kg/h of IV 5% dextrose (ie, 150–300 mL/h for patients weighing 50–100 kg) continuing, with hourly monitoring, until the pNa has returned below the 24-hour limit. We favor the larger upfront bolus in line with the European guidelines, then reassessment before any ongoing infusion. The Adrogué-Madias formula can be used to estimate the sodium-lowering effect of 1000 mL of dextrose 5% with the caveat that this formula assumes no net electrolyte-free water clearance or retention occurs as the dextrose is administered (see Fig. 2). If the pNa is rising faster than desired but has not yet exceeded the maximum target, an infusion of dextrose 5% can be used to prevent further increments. As a rule of thumb, matching the rate of fluid input to hourly urine output (an imperfect indicator of electrolyte-free water clearance) should stabilize pNa in this instance.

Desmopressin, an AVP analogue, may be administered either IV or subcutaneously at a dose of 1 to 2 mcg, to reduce urine output and prevent further increments in pNa. DDAVP is particularly useful in polyuric patients, in situations when a reversible stimulus to AVP is no longer present and accumulated free water is being rapidly excreted (heralded by hypotonic polyuria, ie, low UNa and osmolality). In this context, rather than "chasing" polyuria by attempting to match urine output with high volumes of 5% dextrose or oral free water, urine output is curtailed, allowing judicious administration of electrolyte-free water to actively relower serum sodium, usually in an intensively monitored setting (eg, high dependency or ICU) with frequent (eg, 1–2 hourly) serum sodium monitoring. Clinicians should be aware that desmopressin may not be effective in halting overcorrection from tolvaptan because of AVP receptor blockade, depending on the duration of tolvaptan effect at the renal collecting duct cells. DDAVP is contraindicated for patients with primary polydipsia, in which oral fluid intake cannot be reliably restricted.

### Postoperative diabetes insipidus: how to define and grade this complication? [^a2e5bdc0]. Pituitary (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Although transient diabetes insipidus (DI) is the most common complication of pituitary surgery, there is no consensus on its definition. Polyuria is the most overt symptoms of DI, but can also reflect several physiological adaptive mechanisms in the postoperative phase. These may be difficult to distinguish from and might coincide with DI. The difficulty to distinguish DI from other causes of postoperative polyuria might explain the high variation in incidence rates. This limits interpretation of outcomes, in particular complication rates between centers, and may lead to unnecessary treatment. Aim of this review is to determine a pathophysiologically sound and practical definition of DI for uniform outcome evaluations and treatment recommendations.

Methods

This study incorporates actual data and the experience of our center and combines this with a review of literature on pathophysiological mechanisms and definitions used in clinical studies reporting of postoperative DI.

Results

The occurrence of excessive thirst and/or hyperosmolality or hypernatremia are the best indicators to discriminate between pathophysiological symptoms and signs of DI and other causes. Urine osmolality distinguishes DI from osmotic diuresis.

Conclusions

To improve reliability and comparability we propose the following definition for postoperative DI: polyuria (urine production > 300 ml/hour for 3 h) accompanied by a urine specific gravity (USG) < 1.005, and at least one of the following symptoms: excessive thirst, serum osmolality > 300 mosmol/kg, or serum sodium > 145 mmol/L. To prevent unnecessary treatment with desmopressin, we present an algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of postoperative DI.

Patient 2

A 49-year-old woman with a history of AVP-D following resection of a non-secreting pituitary macroadenoma 4 years ago, currently controlled with desmopressin 250 mcg/day. The patient followed a once weekly desmopressin omitting strategy. Her medical history includes secondary hypothyroidism well-controlled with levothyroxine (100 mcg/day), depression treated with venlafaxine (37.5 mg/day), psoriatic arthritis on methotrexate (10mg weekly) and obesity (BMI = 34.3 kg/m²). She underwent single anastomosis gastric bypass 5 years ago.

Liraglutide was initiated for weight management, with a gradual increase in dose over 4 weeks to 3mg/day. After four months of liraglutide therapy, she experienced a weight reduction from 99 to 92 kg. The patient reported a modest decrease in thirst and desire to drink water, with no alterations in urinary frequency. Laboratory assessments were performed (Table 1), and the desmopressin dose was titrated down to 150 mcg/day (decreased by 100 mcg/day). Three months later, she reported returning to her previous thirst and drinking habits, and her 24-h urine volume was 2300 ml. Additional laboratory findings are presented in Table 1.

### Infection with SARS-CoV-2 may alter the half-life of desmopressin (DDAVP) in patients with central diabetes insipidus [^5daa6109]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

We present a 9-year-old boy with diabetes insipidus. The boy is treated with desmopressin (DDAVP) therapy. Under this therapy, the drinking quantity and the laboratory parameters were normal. No nocturia occurred any more. In the context of a clinically mild infection with SARS-CoV-2, the duration of action of DDAVP was significantly prolonged (approximately +50%). The original dosage was then reintroduced and was still sufficient until months later. A possible connection to the infection with SARS-CoV-2 can be suspected. Our case report should make physicians who care for patients with diabetes insipidus aware of such a possible prolongation of the effect of DDAVP. More frequent monitoring may be needed in such patients to assess the risk of symptomatic dilutional hyponatremia.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^b5997335]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

An alternative approach that has been proposed is "proactive DDAVP", that is, early empirical coadministration both of desmopressin (DDAVP) and hypertonic saline. The rationale is that overcorrection is frequently the result of a spontaneous water diuresis following resolution of transient SIAD, interruption of polydipsia, or cessation of a causative medication. This spontaneous water clearance can be prevented with preemptive desmopressin. The advantage of this approach would be that the rate of correction can be more precisely controlled with hypertonic saline alone (bolus or infusion), without variable outputs to contend with. However, by potentiating SIAD through the administration of an AVP analogue before overcorrection occurs or appears imminent, this approach risks exacerbation or prolonging of hyponatremia symptoms — especially in the presence of ongoing fluid input. In patients with a chronic cause of SIAD (eg, paraneoplastic SIAD), desmopressin is unlikely to have any effect as the underlying cause of antidiuresis is likely to continue. The only data for this proactive approach stem from an uncontrolled observational study in 24 patients with pNa less than 120 mmol/L, predominantly secondary to thiazide diuretics, treated with desmopressin 1 to 2 mcg every 8 hours and weight-based hypertonic saline titrated to achieve a pNa increase of 6 mmol/L in 24 hours. Overall, participants had a mean increase in serum sodium 5.8 mmol/L over 24 hours, 2 patients experienced a decline in serum sodium by 1 to 2 mmol/L after 4 hours, and 2 patients had an above-target increase in serum sodium greater than 10 mmol/L at 24 hours, but no adverse effects were reported. Currently there is insufficient evidence to support this strategy, and instead we endorse a "reactive" or "rescue" approach to desmopressin therapy, in keeping with current guidelines.

### Approach to the patient with suspected hypotonic polyuria [^0a725d52]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Investigation and management of hypotonic polyuria is a common challenge in clinical endocrinology. The 3 main causes, recently renamed to arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D, formerly central diabetes insipidus), arginine vasopressin resistance (AVP-R, formerly nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), and primary polydipsia (PP) require accurate diagnosis, as management differs for each. This new nomenclature more accurately reflects pathophysiology and has now been adopted by the Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED). Advances in diagnosis over the last few years have centered around the use of copeptin measurement. Here, we use 3 patient case histories to highlight the use of this approach, and to demonstrate how it can succeed where other approaches, such as the water deprivation test, sometimes fail. We discuss the overall approach to each type of patient and the strengths and limitations of diagnostic strategies, illustrating the use of the new nomenclature.

### Diabetes insipidus in craniopharyngioma: postoperative management of water and electrolyte disorders [^71fcc927]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Pre-operative central diabetes insipidus has been reported in 8–35% of patients affected with craniopharyngioma, and in 70–90% after surgery. The management of postoperative polyuria and polydipsia can be challenging and fluid balance needs to be closely monitored. The classical triphasic pattern of endogenous vasopressin secretion — an initial phase of symptomatic diabetes insipidus occurring 24 hours after surgery; a second phase of inappropriate vasopressin secretion potentially causing hyponatraemia; and a third phase with a return to diabetes insipidus occurring up to 2 weeks later — is often complicated by cerebral salt wasting and thirst disorders. Inadequate adrenal replacement therapy and anticonvulsant agent treatment may increase the risk of life-threatening hyponatraemia in the course of desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment. Appropriate management, in order to avoid life-threatening or disabling electrolyte disturbances, requires a good grasp of the relevant pathophysiology. We review here the pathophysiology and management of the multiple fluid disorders encountered following surgery for craniopharyngiomas.

### Changing the name of diabetes insipidus: a position statement of the working group for renaming diabetes insipidus [^489e042e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale for Changing the Name of Diabetes Insipidus

There are multiple reasons to change the name of diabetes insipidus at this time. First and foremost, although the terms mellitus and insipidus do differentiate between the clinical characteristics of these two very different causes of polyuria, and clearly are not eponyms, the use of the common term "diabetes" in both has unfortunately led to confusion for both patients and their caretakers. This confusion with diabetes mellitus has been to the detriment of patients with diabetes insipidus when they are under the care of non-endocrine specialists. Some physicians and nurses do not appreciate the difference between these two very different disorders. In several patients with central diabetes insipidus, desmopressin treatment was withheld with serious adverse outcomes, including death. This has led to high profile litigation cases and coroners' inquests involving the police, with wide media coverage. Subsequent to these unfortunate but avoidable cases, national safety alerts, surveys among endocrinologists, and a global task-force consisting of a wide range of senior clinicians involved with the care of patients with diabetes insipidus has led to a strong impetus to change the name of the condition. Second, patients with diabetes insipidus strongly support changing the name to eliminate "diabetes". In a survey of > 1000 patients with central diabetes insipidus recently published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology, 85% preferred the name to be changed, mainly because of experiences with insufficient understanding of the disease by health professionals who confused this disorder with diabetes mellitus. Indeed, 87% percent of patients felt that this lack of knowledge and the resulting clinical confusion affected the management of their condition, eg, repeated blood sugar measurements or prescription of medication for diabetes mellitus during hospitalization. Finally, we believe the names of medical disorders optimally should reflect the underlying pathophysiology, which in the case of diabetes insipidus is now well known to be deficient secretion and/or end-organ effects of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP). Hence, for all the above reasons, the working group proposes that the name diabetes insipidus should be changed to arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D) for central etiologies, and arginine vasopressin resistance (AVP-R) for nephrogenic etiologies, and this proposal has been endorsed by the following societies represented by the working group members: Endocrine Society, European Society of Endocrinology, Pituitary Society, Society for Endocrinology, European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology, Endocrine Society of Australia, Brazilian Endocrine Society, and Japanese Endocrine Society, and is under review at several other societies.

### From cerebral salt wasting to diabetes insipidus with adipsia: case report of a child with craniopharyngioma [^d829baf1]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Craniopharyngioma is associated with a wide and interesting variety of sodium states both by itself and following surgical resection. These are often challenging to diagnose, especially given their dynamic nature during the perioperative course. We present the case of a boy with craniopharyngioma who had hyponatremia due to cerebral salt wasting preoperatively, developed diabetes insipidus (DI) intraoperatively and proceeded to develop hypernatremia with adipsic DI.

Conclusion

Cerebral salt wasting is a rare presenting feature of craniopharyngioma. Postoperative DI can be associated with thirst abnormalities including adipsia due to hypothalamic damage; careful monitoring and a high index of suspicion are required for its detection. Adipsic DI is a difficult condition to manage; hence a conservative surgical approach is suggested.

DDAVP is also available as nasal spray and tablet dosage forms.

When switching between formulations, the below text is meant as guidance for starting dose. However, dose should always be titrated individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) of the patient.

When switching from DDAVP Nasal Spray to DDAVP Injection, the starting dose is one-tenth times the DDAVP Nasal Spray dose.

When switching from DDAVP Tablets to DDAVP Injection, titrate dose individually according to the diuresis (antidiuretic response) and electrolyte status (serum sodium) due to the large variability in both PK and PD. Monitor patients closely during the initial dose titration period.

### Tolvaptan for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^d21b14f5]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

We follow a stringent protocol, for the first 24 h of tolvaptan use:

Monitor serum sodium 6-hourly (baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h after initial dose).
Keep an accurate fluid balance chart, recording fluid input and urine output at 2-h intervals.
If 6-h sodium rise exceeds 6 mmol/litre or 12-h sodium rise exceeds 8 mmol/litre or 18-h sodium rise exceeds 10 mmol/litre or urine output exceeds 200 ml/h for two consecutive hours, notify the clinical team in charge of tolvaptan therapy and intensify monitoring. Halt further correction by administration of intravenous infusion of dextrose 5% at a rate equal to urine output or, alternatively, administer desmopressin 2 μg as a stat dose intravenously and after 8 h.
If the sodium rise is even more pronounced, requiring reversal of overly rapid correction, there are two ways for re-lowering serum sodium. The first regimen is intravenous infusion of dextrose 5% at a rate of 6–10 ml/kg over 2 h, recheck serum sodium in 2 h, and, if needed, continue infusion until target serum sodium is reached. Alternatively, administer desmopressin 2 μg intravenously plus an intravenous infusion of dextrose 5% in water at a rate of 3–5 ml/kg over 2 h, recheck serum sodium in 2 h, and, if needed, continue infusion until the target sodium is reached.

Following the first day after tolvaptan initiation, the preferred strategy for most patients, especially those who receive active treatment for the underlying aetiology of SIAD, is daily evaluation and decision to offer stat doses on a day-to-day basis, if and when required, since two to four doses in total are adequate treatment for most inpatients with SIAD of short duration. Tolvaptan dose titration usually takes place during hospitalisation according to the serum sodium concentration. In patients with SIAD of long, or even indefinite, duration, daily tolvaptan administration as a repeat prescription can be considered. The tolvaptan dose can also be safely up-titrated on outpatient basis since the risk of overly rapid sodium correction applies to the first 48 h following tolvaptan initiation.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^73c2aeba]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

ADPKD — Rationale and evidence for high water intake — The basal circulating arginine vasopressin (AVP) level typically ranges between 0.5 and 2 pg/ml, which results in a urine osmolality that is ~ 1–2-fold higher than the serum osmolality, and a urine volume of 1–3 l/d. The maximal suppression of AVP to < 0.5 pg/ml will produce a urine volume of > 3 l/d, but it requires a level of fluid consumption that exceeds population-based recommendations (> 8 l/d) and increases the risk for life-threatening hyponatremia. Overall, the empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of increasing water intake to reduce kidney disease progression is limited, and long-term data include a single 3-year multicenter study comparing usual ad libitum water intake to individualized, prescribed, and closely monitored water intake intended to reduce urine osmolality to ≤ 270 mOsmol/kg, with a mean 24-hour urine volume of 3 l/d in the intervention group and 2.5 l/d in the control arm. In large studies, most people with ADPKD had a mean urine volume of 2.4 l/d at baseline, and in the El-Damanawi et al. study and the PREVENT-ADPKD trial in people with eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m² who increased water intake approximately 10% developed mild reversible hyponatremia without clinical significance. In the PREVENT-ADPKD study, the target osmolality of urine from a 24-hour test was achieved in only half of the prescribed water group and by 17% of the ad libitum water group, and serum copeptin levels were not different in the 2 groups.

### Copeptin levels and commonly used laboratory parameters in hospitalised patients with severe hypernatraemia-the "Co-MED study" [^454952dc]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical variables and management of participants during the study

At study inclusion, the following data were prospectively collected: vital signs; co-morbidities; current medications; symptoms related to hypernatraemia; and laboratory parameters such as plasma osmolality, urea, uric acid and, where available, complete urine analysis. The attending physician, who was not involved in the study protocol, treated patients during hospitalisation with either glucose infusion, free water load, stopping of the iatrogenic cause, or DDAVP.

While hospitalised, patients' serum sodium levels were measured at least daily until normalisation of sodium levels. Other laboratory measurements, such as creatinine, potassium, uric acid and urea, were performed regularly according to the treating physician. Acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease were diagnosed according to current Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula. During hospitalisation, every change in drugs and therapeutic management, including therapy success, was carefully monitored. Additionally, a 24-h fluid balance, including oral intake of free water, parenteral nutrition, all intravenous infusions and, where possible, urine output, was obtained daily until serum sodium levels were restored. A board-certified endocrinologist assessed volaemic status by complete clinical examination. Special attention was paid to the visual assessment of the external jugular venous pressure, presence of oedema or ascites, weight course during hospitalisation, humidity of mucous membranes and skin turgor. The final diagnosis of the underlying cause of hypernatraemia was made retrospectively by three independent investigators blinded to copeptin levels and was based on a complete chart review, including prospectively collected laboratory parameters at study inclusion and during hospitalisation (i.e. plasma osmolality, urea, uric acid, total protein, potassium, serum osmolality, creatinine, albumin and glucose), urine parameters where available (i.e. complete urine analysis), 24-h fluid balance and the entire inpatient course during hospitalisation, including treatment response to all interventions. For the adjudicated differential diagnosis, a pre-defined algorithm with four etiologic classifications was used (see Table 1 and Additional file 1). In case of discordance, patient charts were mutually discussed until a final agreement was reached.

### Child with suspected diabetes insipidus [^fd30940d]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Child with suspected diabetes insipidus — desmopressin (DDAVP) is often used for control of significant polyuria/polydipsia; it is a synthetic long acting analog of vasopressin and is available in oral tablets and melts, intranasal and subcutaneous form. There is a risk of sodium fluctuations and hyponatremia with DDAVP treatment; care should be taken during treatment as inadvertent large doses may lead to severe hyponatremia and seizures, and ensuring "breakthrough" voiding close to the next dose can be helpful to limit risk of hyponatremia. In some older children with diabetes insipidus and intact thirst mechanism, increasing fluid intake to match urine output and avoid hypernatremia can be sufficient treatment; children with intact thirst mechanism can usually self-regulate to increase their water intake to avoid dehydration, and avoiding pharmacological therapy can prevent sodium fluctuations and risk for hyponatremia.

Hypopituitarism

Clinicians need to remain vigilant in managing patients with hypopituitarism during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an increased background mortality rate among patients with hypopituitarism, particularly due to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease, which is an important risk factor for COVID-19 disease severity. There is also a careful balance in managing the threat of AI at this time with prolonged GC over-replacement and consequent immunosuppression. Patients with diabetes insipidus (DI) present a particular challenge in fluid balance during significant illness, with hypernatremia linked to increased mortality in those admitted to intensive care units.

Diagnosis

In a patient with a newly detected pituitary lesion or suspected hypopituitarism, an early morning fasted pituitary profile should be arranged promptly with a local laboratory and results can be discussed at a VV. If DI is strongly suspected based on clinical history a non-fasted morning blood sample for serum sodium and osmolality should be collected first. Patients with complete DI often present with hypernatremia in this setting, avoiding the need for a protracted water deprivation test. A cortisol level < 3 µg/dL indicates AI while a cortisol level > 15 µg/dL reliably excludes AI. Dynamic testing is ordinarily performed to determine adequacy of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis with intermediate results, however there may be a significant delay in obtaining a short cosyntropin test, or insulin tolerance test, at this time with health care systems limiting direct exposure of patients to health care personnel. A low free T4 in concert with a low/normal TSH is suggestive of central hypothyroidism. In non-obese males with a pituitary lesion, low serum testosterone and low/normal gonadotrophins likely indicate central hypogonadism. Low estradiol with low/normal gonadotrophins in a pre-menopausal woman with amenorrhea (excluding other causes such as hypothalamic amenorrhea and hyperprolactinemia) or in a post-menopausal female also suggest central hypogonadism. Growth hormone deficiency is highly likely (even with a normal IGF-1 level) to co-exist in a patient with deficiencies of 3–4 pituitary axes although dynamic testing to confirm GH deficiency should be deferred for 6–12 months until specialized endocrine testing units are once again conducting these non-urgent procedures.

### Diagnosis and management of central diabetes insipidus in adults [^cde7ec53]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is characterized by hypotonic polyuria due to impairment of AVP secretion from the posterior pituitary. In clinical practice, it needs to be distinguished from renal resistance to the antidiuretic effects of AVP (nephrogenic DI), and abnormalities of thirst appreciation (primary polydipsia). As nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is rare in adults, unless they are treated with lithium salts, the practical challenge is how to differentiate between CDI and clinical disorders of excess thirst. The differential diagnosis is usually straight forward, but the recommended gold standard test, the water deprivation test, is not without interpretative pitfalls. The addition of the measurement of plasma AVP concentrations improves diagnostic accuracy, but the radioimmunoassay for AVP is technically difficult, and is only available in a few specialized centres. More recently, the measurement of plasma copeptin concentrations has been claimed to provide a reliable alternative to measurement of plasma AVP, without the sampling handling challenges. In addition, the measurement of thirst ratings can help the differentiation between CDI and primary polydipsia. Once the diagnosis of CDI is biochemically certain, investigations to determine the cause of AVP deficiency are needed. In this review, we will outline the diagnostic approach to polyuria, revisit the caveats of the water deprivation test and review recent data on value of adding AVP/copeptin measurement. We will also discuss treatment strategies for CDI, with analysis of potential complications of treatment.

Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death. Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia, with excessive fluid intake, using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, with known or suspected SIADH, and/or illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances.

Avoid concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia. Prior to starting or resuming Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP, ensure that the serum sodium concentration is normal. Limit fluid intake to a minimum from 1 hour before administration until 8 hours after administration. Use of Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP without concomitant reduction of fluid intake may lead to fluid retention and hyponatremia. Monitor the serum sodium concentration within 1 week and approximately 1 month of initiating Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP, and periodically thereafter. Base the frequency of serum sodium monitoring on the patient's risk of hyponatremia. Patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance, geriatric and pediatric patients, patients receiving concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia, and patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may drink excessive amounts of water, may be at increased risk of hyponatremia. If hyponatremia occurs, Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued and treatment for the hyponatremia instituted, depending on the clinical circumstances, including the duration and severity of the hyponatremia. Desmopressin Acetate Injection USP can cause fluid retention, which can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Patients with heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension may be at increased risk.

### Diabetes insipidus as a complication after pituitary surgery [^a3dbb422]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Medium credibility.

Background

A 28-year-old woman presented with new-onset vertigo and diplopia that had started 2 weeks previously. An MRI scan of the brain revealed an 11 x 9 x 9 mm sellar mass that extended into the suprasellar region. Evaluation of pituitary function showed mild central hypothyroidism and secondary adrenal insufficiency. The patient underwent trans-sphenoidal resection of the mass without any significant intraoperative complications. On postoperative day 1 she abruptly developed polyuria, hypernatremia and urine hypo-osmolality.

Investigations

Measurements of plasma and urine osmolality, urine specific gravity, and serum sodium levels.

Diagnosis

Postoperative diabetes insipidus with a triphasic pattern.

Management

The patient's diabetes insipidus was initially treated with intravenous desmopressin, and her fluid status, serum sodium levels, and serum and urine osmolality were carefully monitored. During the second, antidiuretic phase, desmopressin was discontinued and the patient's fluid intake was restricted. After recurrence of diabetes insipidus during the third phase, the patient was treated with intranasal desmopressin and was discharged. She remains on desmopressin therapy for chronic diabetes insipidus.

### SGLT2 inhibitor in a type 2 diabetes mellitus patient coexisted with central diabetes insipidus following hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^81e48591]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

CDI is characterized by hypotonic polyuria due to impaired vasopressin physiology often accompanied by hypernatremia and hyperosmolality if fluid losses are not adequately replaced. Discriminating CDI from primary polydipsia can be challenging. A water deprivation test remains a valuable tool for differential diagnosis. In this case, polyuria was not initially associated with hypotonic urine (maximum specific urine gravity: 1.018) while the patient was on dapagliflozin. However, two days after discontinuing dapagliflozin, hypotonic polyuria became evident, and a water deprivation test confirmed CDI, showing an increase in urine specific gravity from 1.005 to 1.010 and urine osmolality from 19 to 86 mOsm/kg.

Several intriguing features were observed in this patient. During her second admission, she presented with hypernatremia without thirst, but by her third admission, she developed significant polydipsia (up to 10 L/day). This transient adipsia may have resulted from temporary damage to thirst-regulating neurons and osmoreceptors due to hypovolemia, which resolved over time. Additionally, the osmotic diuresis caused by poorly controlled diabetes and the use of SGLT2 inhibitors likely exacerbated her polydipsia and polyuria. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce glucose and sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, contributing to osmotic diuresis. A similar case was reported in a patient with adipsic CDI following traumatic brain injury, where empagliflozin obscured low urine osmolality (a relatively high urine osmolality: 529mOsm/kg) and partially attenuated the antidiuretic effect of desmopressin. Five days after discontinuing empagliflozin, a second desmopressin test exhibited a significant reduction in urine volume. Refardt et al. also demonstrated that empagliflozin increased urinary excretion (total urinary excretion of 579 mL ± 194.8 mL in empagliflozin treatment for 8 h versus 367 mL ± 158.8 mL in the placebo group, p = 0.017.) in healthy volunteers with artificially induced syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion by administration of desmopressin. These findings suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors can influence urine osmolality and may slightly reduce the efficacy of desmopressin. Therefore, SGLT2 inhibitors should be discontinued when evaluating urine osmolality to differentiate polyuria.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. report of the hyponatremia registry [^2a3a2c52]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

In summary, despite the high prevalence of HN, and published guidance on its diagnosis and treatment, numerous shortcomings in current HN management are evident. HN in general and SIADH in particular are often diagnosed without attention to accepted diagnostic criteria. Strikingly, many patients receive no specific treatment for HN. FR was predictably the most frequent initial therapy but was ineffective in more than half of the cases. When unsuccessful, FR was often not followed with an additional therapy. Despite the availability of active therapies to correct [Na +], HS, and vasopressin-receptor antagonists, clinicians typically discharge patients with unresolved HN. From this study, we can conclude that educational efforts should focus on how to diagnose SIADH with rigor, on the lack of efficacy of FR alone and the potential for [Na +] to fall with FR alone, on the use of active treatments to raise [Na +] urgently when needed, and on increasing the awareness of situations where overly rapid correction is likely. One such circumstance highlighted in the present study is the immediate postoperative period after pituitary surgery where SIADH may occur but be transient and diabetes insipidus requiring desmopressin may supervene. Here, concomitant treatment with active therapies may pose a special risk. Randomized controlled trials of HN therapy are needed to compare relative efficacy, risks of over rapid correction, and overall costs, particularly for the active treatments. Given the strong association of HN with adverse outcomes, but persisting uncertainty about whether HN contributes to the poor outcomes or is only a marker of severe underlying disease, research efforts should, in addition, focus on which patients are more likely to respond to specific therapies and which will directly benefit from correction of HN.

### Copeptin levels and commonly used laboratory parameters in hospitalised patients with severe hypernatraemia-the "Co-MED study" [^421fd32e]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Dysnatraemias are common in-hospital electrolyte disturbances and are related to inequalities in water homeostasis. Mild hypernatraemia, defined as a serum sodium value > 145 mmol/L occurs in about 1–3% of hospitalised patients, whereas more severe hypernatraemia (i.e. > 155 mmol/L) is rarer. Mortality rates in patients with hypernatraemia are clearly increased up to 37–55%.

Mostly, hypernatraemia represents a free water deficit in relation to the body's sodium stores and can result from a free water loss (i.e.g.astrointestinal losses, osmotic diuresis and diabetes insipidus) or a gain of sodium, typically resulting from iatrogenic sodium load. The differential diagnosis of the underlying cause of hypernatraemia is based mostly first on the measurement of urine osmolality and second on the assessment of extracellular fluid volume status. Recently, a study showed insufficient urine sampling in hospitalised patients with hyponatraemia, which indicated low urine collection rates in hospitalised patients. To date, urine collection rates for patients with hypernatraemia have not been reported, but in clinical practice urine sampling seems to be neglected in patients with life-threatening conditions. Furthermore, the assessment of the extracellular fluid volume status in clinical practice remains challenging and can be misleading. Several studies show that in clinical practice correction of hypernatraemia is inadequate, and delayed treatment may have morbid clinical consequences. Therefore, a readily available diagnostic marker for the differential diagnosis of hypernatraemia would be of major clinical importance, especially for identification of patients with central diabetes insipidus, who need prompt treatment with desmopressin (DDAVP).

The most important hormone for the regulation of water homeostasis is arginine vasopressin (AVP). The measurement of AVP is cumbersome, but copeptin is produced in equimolar amounts to AVP, and recent data show that copeptin levels mirror AVP levels during disorders of water balance. Copeptin is stable in plasma and serum and can be readily determined. In the present study, we therefore aimed to investigate whether, compared with usual biomarkers and clinical signs, copeptin measurement improves the differential diagnosis in patients with severe hypernatraemia.
