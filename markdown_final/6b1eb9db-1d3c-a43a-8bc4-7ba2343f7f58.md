## Question

what are the presenting symptoms and signs of acute nicotine toxicity?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the presenting symptoms and signs of acute nicotine toxicity. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology to anchor the expected clinical pattern. Then, I should verify the classic biphasic toxidrome and its timing. Next, I will enumerate organ-system manifestations, distinguishing early excitatory from late depressive phases. After that, I need to consider special populations and exposure routes that modify presentation. Finally, I will integrate severity markers and synthesize a concise, prioritized list of findings with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic foundation, because the clinical picture flows directly from nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonism at peripheral and central sites, producing initial stimulation followed by receptor desensitation and blockade. This explains the biphasic pattern and multi-system involvement seen in acute toxicity [^53459c7f] [^29236b45].

> I will now examine the classic biphasic toxidrome to ensure I get the timing right. Early stimulation typically begins within 15 minutes to 1 hour and reflects nicotinic cholinergic excess, whereas the late inhibitory phase emerges between 30 minutes and 4 hours and reflects neuromuscular blockade and CNS depression. Duration varies with exposure severity, roughly 1–2 hours after mild exposure and up to 18–24 hours after severe exposure, with death possible within 1 hour in severe cases [^53459c7f] [^0f75d81c].

> Next, I should review gastrointestinal manifestations, since vomiting is the most common symptom and often an early clue. Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and increased salivation are typical early features, with diarrhea appearing more often in the late phase; this aligns with both cholinergic stimulation and subsequent autonomic collapse [^53459c7f] [^0c76948d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the cardiovascular pattern; I need to check the directionality. Early phase shows hypertension and tachycardia from sympathetic stimulation, whereas the late phase brings hypotension, bradycardia, and arrhythmias, including conduction abnormalities and shock; case reports also describe Brugada-pattern ECG changes in the setting of nicotine toxicity, underscoring potential cardiac electrical instability [^53459c7f] [^bd1114c3].

> Let me consider respiratory findings carefully. Early, patients may have tachypnea and bronchospasm, but the life-threatening complication is late-phase respiratory failure due to paralysis of respiratory muscles and airway secretions; this is the usual mechanism of death in severe cases, so I should flag progressive dyspnea, shallow respirations, and hypoxia as red flags [^53459c7f] [^0c76948d].

> I should confirm the neurologic progression. Early CNS effects include headache, dizziness, confusion, agitation, restlessness, ataxia, and sensory disturbances, while severe cases progress to seizures, loss of reflexes, flaccid paralysis, coma, and fixed pupils in the late phase; this mirrors the transition from excitation to depression and the risk of respiratory arrest [^53459c7f] [^0c76948d].

> Wait, let me verify autonomic and muscarinic features so I don't overstate nicotinic effects. Sweating, pallor, and mydriasis or miosis can occur, and fasciculations or tremor reflect neuromuscular nicotinic stimulation; in the late phase, loss of muscle tone and areflexia signal impending respiratory failure, which is a critical inflection point for airway management [^53459c7f] [^0c76948d].

> I need to ensure I account for special populations and exposure routes. Children are uniquely vulnerable due to low lethal thresholds, with severe toxicity reported after ingestion of small amounts of concentrated e-liquid; dermal and ocular exposures can also cause systemic toxicity, and green tobacco sickness from dermal absorption presents with weakness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, cramping, and autonomic fluctuations [^57cac0a2] [^d22878e2].

> Let me reconsider the severity markers so I don't miss high-risk features. Persistent vomiting, seizures, hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory depression, and altered mental status indicate severe poisoning and mandate aggressive supportive care; case series and reports consistently show that rapid deterioration can occur, and early airway intervention is lifesaving in such cases [^53459c7f] [^0c76948d].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or confounded by co-exposures. E-liquids may contain propylene glycol, flavorants, or other agents that blur the pure nicotinic picture, and some cases show delayed or prolonged toxicity; therefore, I should double-check for mixed toxidromes and maintain a high index of suspicion when there is a vaping or e-liquid exposure history with evolving symptoms [^53459c7f] [^57cac0a2].

> In summary, I should synthesize a prioritized, organ-system list that clinicians can use at the bedside. Early phase: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hypersalivation, diarrhea, hypertension, tachycardia, pallor, diaphoresis, headache, dizziness, confusion, agitation, tremor, fasciculations, and tachypnea. Late phase: hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmias, shock, shallow or absent respirations, flaccid paralysis, loss of reflexes, seizures, coma, and death from respiratory failure. This biphasic pattern, with vomiting as the most common symptom and respiratory failure as the usual cause of death, is the hallmark of acute nicotine toxicity [^53459c7f] [^0c76948d].

---

Acute nicotine toxicity presents with a **biphasic pattern**: early stimulation (within 15–60 minutes) with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, salivation, tachycardia, hypertension, tremor, and confusion; followed by a late depressive phase (30 minutes–4 hours) with bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory depression, seizures, and coma [^53459c7f] [^0f75d81c]. Vomiting is the **most common symptom** and occurs in > 50% of cases [^53459c7f]. Severe toxicity can cause respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and death within 1 hour [^53459c7f] [^0c76948d]. Children are at **high risk** due to low lethal doses (1–13 mg/kg), and small ingestions of concentrated e-liquids can be fatal [^57cac0a2] [^0f75d81c].

---

## Clinical presentation and progression

Acute nicotine toxicity typically progresses through **two distinct phases**:

| **Phase** | **Timeframe** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Early (stimulation) phase | 15 minutes to 1 hour after exposure | - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Abdominal pain <br/> - Increased salivation <br/> - Diarrhea <br/> - Tachycardia <br/> - Hypertension <br/> - Tremor <br/> - Confusion <br/> - Agitation <br/> - Headache <br/> - Dizziness <br/> - Visual and auditory disturbances [^53459c7f] [^0c76948d] |
| Late (depressive) phase | 30 minutes to 4 hours after exposure | - Bradycardia <br/> - Hypotension <br/> - Respiratory depression <br/> - Seizures <br/> - Coma <br/> - Muscle weakness or paralysis <br/> - Cardiac arrhythmias <br/> - Shock <br/> - Death due to respiratory failure or cardiac arrest [^53459c7f] [^0c76948d] |

---

## Common symptoms and signs

The **most frequently reported symptoms and signs** of acute nicotine toxicity include:

- **Gastrointestinal**: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, increased salivation, diarrhea [^53459c7f] [^0c76948d].
- **Cardiovascular**: Tachycardia, hypertension, bradycardia, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias [^53459c7f] [^0c76948d].
- **Neurological**: Headache, dizziness, confusion, agitation, tremor, seizures, coma [^53459c7f] [^0c76948d].
- **Respiratory**: Rapid breathing, respiratory depression, respiratory failure [^53459c7f] [^0c76948d].
- **Autonomic**: Sweating, pallor, flushing, pupillary changes [^53459c7f] [^0c76948d].

---

## Severity and progression

Severity correlates with dose, route, and individual susceptibility. Mild cases may resolve within 1–2 hours, whereas severe exposures can persist 18–24 hours and progress to **respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death** [^53459c7f] [^0c76948d]. Death can occur within 1 hour of severe exposure, particularly in children or with concentrated e-liquids [^53459c7f] [^0f75d81c].

---

## Special considerations in pediatric populations

Children are uniquely vulnerable to nicotine toxicity due to their lower body mass and higher susceptibility. Severe toxicity has been reported with ingestions as small as 1–2 mg/kg, and **lethal doses are estimated at 1–13 mg/kg** [^57cac0a2] [^0f75d81c]. Common pediatric exposures include ingestion of e-cigarette liquids, which are often brightly colored and flavored, increasing the risk of accidental ingestion [^57cac0a2] [^63b7c17a].

---

## Clinical management implications

Recognition of the biphasic pattern is critical for management. Early supportive care focuses on **airway protection, gastrointestinal decontamination, and cardiovascular stabilization**, while the late phase requires aggressive respiratory support and monitoring for seizures and cardiac complications [^0c76948d] [^af69a0be]. Activated charcoal may be considered if the patient is awake and the ingestion is recent, though its efficacy is limited by frequent vomiting [^0c76948d] [^5206a5f1].

---

Acute nicotine toxicity presents with a **biphasic pattern**, beginning with gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and neurological stimulation, followed by depression with respiratory failure and cardiac complications. Rapid recognition and supportive care are essential, especially in children, given the low lethal dose and potential for rapid deterioration [^53459c7f] [^57cac0a2].

### Nicotinic plant poisoning [^29236b45]. Clinical Toxicology (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

A wide range of plants contain nicotinic and nicotinic-like alkaloids. Of this diverse group, those that have been reported to cause human poisoning appear to have similar mechanisms of toxicity and presenting patients therefore have comparable toxidromes. This review describes the taxonomy and principal alkaloids of plants that contain nicotinic and nicotinic-like alkaloids, with particular focus on those that are toxic to humans. The toxicokinetics and mechanisms of toxicity of these alkaloids are reviewed and the clinical features and management of poisoning due to these plants are described.

Methods

This review was compiled by systematically searching OVID MEDLINE and ISI Web of Science. This identified 9,456 papers, excluding duplicates, all of which were screened. Reviewed plants and their principal alkaloids. Plants containing nicotine and nicotine-like alkaloids that have been reported to be poisonous to humans include Conium maculatum, Nicotiana glauca and Nicotiana tabacum, Laburnum anagyroides, and Caulophyllum thalictroides. They contain the toxic alkaloids nicotine, anabasine, cytisine, n-methylcytisine, coniine, n-methylconiine, and gamma-coniceine.

Mechanisms Of Toxicity

These alkaloids act agonistically at nicotinic-type acetylcholine (cholinergic) receptors (nAChRs). The nicotinic-type acetylcholine receptor can vary both in its subunit composition and in its distribution within the body (the central and autonomic nervous systems, the neuromuscular junctions, and the adrenal medulla). Agonistic interaction at these variable sites may explain why the alkaloids have diverse effects depending on the administered dose and duration of exposure.

Toxicokinetics

Nicotine and nicotine-like alkaloids are absorbed readily across all routes of exposure and are rapidly and widely distributed, readily traversing the blood-brain barrier and the placenta, and are freely distributed in breast milk. Metabolism occurs predominantly in the liver followed by rapid renal elimination.

Clinical Features

Following acute exposure, symptoms typically follow a biphasic pattern. The early phase consists of nicotinic cholinergic stimulation resulting in symptoms such as abdominal pain, hypertension, tachycardia, and tremors. The second inhibitory phase is delayed and often heralded by hypotension, bradycardia, and dyspnea, finally leading to coma and respiratory failure.

Management

Supportive care is the mainstay of management with primary emphasis on cardiovascular and respiratory support to ensure recovery.

Conclusions

Exposure to plants containing nicotine and nicotine-like alkaloids can lead to severe poisoning but, with prompt supportive care, patients should make a full recovery.

### Critical care support of patients with nicotine addiction [^ca78fd24]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Over 500 million of the current world population will die from diseases caused by smoking cigarettes. The symptoms and signs of nicotine withdrawal are not well described in the critically ill. Since the various conditions of critical illness may lead to clinical manifestations mimicking nicotine withdrawal, describing its specific manifestations may not be easy. A few case reports suggest that nicotine replacement therapy may ameliorate nicotine withdrawal in the critically ill. However, retrospective studies have found that it may increase mortality. Despite the abundance of active smokers, there is a paucity of data describing nicotine withdrawal, and its prevention and treatment options in the critically ill. Future studies are warranted to address these issues.

### The approach to the patient with an unknown overdose [^fb969d21]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Toxic overdose can present with various clinical signs and symptoms. These may be the only clues to diagnosis when the cause of toxicity is unknown at the time of initial assessment. The prognosis and clinical course of recovery of a patient poisoned by a specific agent depends largely on the quality of care delivered within the first few hours in the emergency setting. Usually the drug or toxin can be quickly identified by a careful history, a directed physical examination, and commonly available laboratory tests. Once the patient has been stabilized, the physician must consider how to minimize the bioavailability of toxin not yet absorbed, which antidotes (if any) to administer, and if other measures to enhance elimination are necessary.

### Notes from the field: calls to poison centers for exposures to electronic cigarettes-United States, September 2010-February 2014… [^d9f2063d]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

1). In many states, there are no restrictions on the sale of e-cigarettes to minors. Although e-cigarette use is increasing among U. S. adolescents and adults, its overall impact on public health remains unclear. One area of concern is the potential of e-cigarettes to cause acute nicotine toxicity. An e-cigarette exposure call was defined as a call regarding an exposure to the e-cigarette device itself or to the nicotine liquid, which typically is contained in a cartridge that the user inserts into the e-cigarette. A cigarette exposure call was defined as a call regarding an exposure to tobacco cigarettes, but not cigarette butts. During the study period, PCs reported 2, 405 e-cigarette and 16, 248 cigarette exposure calls from across the United States, the District of Columbia, and U. S. territories. E-cigarette exposure calls per month increased from one in September 2010 to 215 in February 2014.

Cigarette exposure calls ranged from 301 to 512 calls per month and were more frequent in summer months, a pattern also observed with total call volume to PCs involving all exposures, eye exposures, and skin exposures, and less likely to be reported as ingestions compared with cigarette exposures. Among the 9, 839 exposure calls with information about the severity of adverse health effects, e-cigarette exposure calls were more likely to report an adverse health effect after exposure than cigarette exposure calls. The most common adverse health effects in e-cigarette exposure calls were vomiting, nausea, and eye irritation. One suicide death from intravenous injection of nicotine liquid was reported to PCs. Given the rapid increase in e-cigarette-related exposures, of which 51.

1% were among young children, developing strategies to monitor and prevent future poisonings is critical. Health-care providers; the public health community; e-cigarette manufacturers, distributors, sellers, and marketers; and the public should be aware that e-cigarettes have the potential to cause acute adverse health effects and represent an emerging public health concern.

### Health effects of vaping | Smoking and tobacco use… [^15b44938]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance Learn more about the health effects of vaping. Overview
- No tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, are safe.
- Most e-cigarettes contain nicotine, which is highly addictive and is a health danger for pregnant women, developing fetuses, and youth.
- Aerosol from e-cigarettes can also contain harmful and potentially harmful substances. These include cancer-causing chemicals and tiny particles that can be inhaled deep into lungs. Nicotine Most e-cigarettes, or vapes, contain nicotine, which has known adverse health effects.
- Nicotine is highly addictive.
- Nicotine is toxic to developing fetuses and is a health danger for pregnant women.
- Acute nicotine exposure can be toxic. Children and adults have been poisoned by swallowing, breathing, or absorbing vaping liquid through their skin or eyes. More than 80% of calls to U. S. poison control centers for e-cigarettes are for children less than 5 years old.

Other potential harms of e-cigarettes E-cigarette aerosol can contain substances that can be harmful or potentially harmful to the body. These include:

- Nicotine, a highly addictive chemical that can harm adolescent brain development
- Cancer-causing chemicals
- Heavy metals such as nickel, tin, and lead
- Tiny particles that can be inhaled deep into the lungs
- Volatile organic compounds
- Flavorings such as diacetyl, a chemical linked to a serious lung disease. Some flavorings used in e-cigarettes may be safe to eat but not to inhale because the lungs process substances differently than the gut. Nicotine addiction and withdrawal Nicotine is the main addictive substance in tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. With repeated use, a person's brain gets used to having nicotine. This can make them think they need nicotine just to feel okay. This is part of nicotine addiction.

Signs of nicotine addiction include craving nicotine, being unable to stop using it, and developing a tolerance. Nicotine addiction can also affect relationships with family and friends and performance in school, at work, or other activities. When someone addicted to nicotine stops using it, their body and brain have to adjust. This can result in temporary symptoms of nicotine withdrawal which may include:

- Feeling irritable, jumpy, restless, or anxious
- Feeling sad or down
- Having trouble sleeping
- Having a hard time concentrating
- Feeling hungry
- Craving nicotine.

### Electronic nicotine delivery systems [^092c573f]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) — pediatric clinical guidance states to counsel parents and caregivers about strategies to reduce exposure to ENDS aerosol, such as instituting bans on ENDS use in the home and car, and that the best protection from exposure to ENDS aerosol is for parents and caregivers to not use ENDS; if that is not possible, pediatricians should recommend ENDS-free policies for their home and car. Pediatricians should be familiar with symptoms of acute nicotine poisoning and consider acute nicotine poisoning from ENDS solutions when treating a child with symptoms consistent with acute nicotine poisoning unexplained by other etiologies, and if an exposure occurs or there is concern for exposure, the American Association of Poison Control Centers (1-800-222-1222) should be contacted.

### Catastrophic brain injury after nicotine insecticide ingestion [^ad44908b]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Much attention has been paid to the long-term toxic and carcinogenic effects of nicotine-containing substances, particularly tobacco. Although rare, acute ingestions of large amounts of nicotine can produce rapid and dramatic toxicity. We present a case of an ingestion of a nicotine sulfate solution by a 15-year-old boy resulting in hypoxia and irreversible encephalopathy. The diagnosis of acute nicotine toxicity potentially could be delayed due to the fact that nicotine and cotinine are so commonly found on drug screens that they are considered "normal variants".

### Toxidromes and a general approach to poisoning [^b034458b]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2025). Medium credibility.

A toxicologic syndrome, or toxidrome, is a distinct pattern of effects of poisoning. Well-defined toxidromes are the opioid, anticholinergic, cholinergic and sympathomimetic, and an additional described toxidrome is GABAergic. These toxidromes are named for the receptor effects causing their specific clinical findings, and knowledge of toxidromes allows rapid pattern recognition of specific poisonings. In this review, toxidromes and the initial assessment and general approach to management of acute poisoning are discussed. This article details the receptor-level effects of the poisoning, key clinical signs and symptoms and the role antidotes play in treatment. Clinical resources such as Toxbase and others exist to provide detailed guidance on clinical management of poisoning.

### Neonicotinoid insecticides: an emerging cause of acute pesticide poisoning [^abfa53f3]. Clinical Toxicology (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neonicotinoids are a relatively new class of insecticides. They exhibit agonistic effects at postsynaptic nicotinic receptors in insects and are believed to have low toxicity in humans.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of all neonicotinoid exposures reported to the Taiwan National Poison Center to better understand the toxicity profile of neonicotinoid insecticides.

Results

A total of 70 patients were analyzed. Most exposures involved suicidal ingestions of imidacloprid alone. Clinical manifestations of neonicotinoid insecticide toxicity bear some resemblance to those of acute nicotine poisoning. Although most exposures were of mild-to-moderate severity, eight patients developed major effects and two died. Aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure were the main cause of severe toxicity.

Conclusion

Significant toxicity of neonicotinoids can occur following large amount of oral ingestion. Poisoned patients may present with cholinergic syndrome, and judicious use of atropine seems justified. Symptomatic treatment, especially ventilator support, remains most important in clinical management.

### Acute nicotine poisoning associated with a traditional remedy for eczema [^aaaccb93]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2001). Low credibility.

We present a case of severe acute nicotine poisoning in an 8 year old boy with moderate eczema after topical application of a traditional remedy from a book published in Bangladesh. Symptoms consistent with nicotine poisoning developed within 30 minutes of application of the remedy. The child subsequently improved with supportive care and was discharged after five days with no neurological sequelae. Diagnosis of nicotine poisoning was not initially made due to difficulty in obtaining an accurate history via an interpreter from the parents who did not speak English. Samples taken 12 hours after application of the remedy showed a serum nicotine of 89 microgram/l, serum cotinine of 1430 microgram/l, urine nicotine of 1120 microgram/l, and a urine cotinine of 6960 microgram/l confirming acute nicotine poisoning.

### Recognition and management of acute medication poisoning [^af69b0be]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Poisoning is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, with several million episodes reported annually. Acute medication poisonings account for nearly one half of all poisonings reported in the United States and should be considered in persons with an acute change in mental status. The initial approach to a person who has been poisoned should be to assess the airway, breathing, and circulation, and to take a thorough history. Less than 1 percent of poisonings are fatal; therefore, management in most cases is supportive unless a specific antidote is available. Single-dose activated charcoal is the gastrointestinal decontamination modality of choice, but should not be used universally. Toxidromes are constellations of symptoms commonly encountered with certain drug classes, including anticholinergics, cholinergics, opioids, and sympathomimetics. Evaluation of possible medication poisonings should include basic laboratory studies, such as a complete metabolic profile, to determine electrolyte imbalances and liver and renal function. Most other laboratory studies should be performed based on clinical presentation and history. Ongoing treatment of unstable patients with toxic medication ingestions should focus on correcting hypoxia and acidosis while maintaining adequate circulation. These patients can have rapid decline in mental or hemodynamic status even when they appear to be compensating. Children can experience more profound effects from small amounts of medication. Disposition of a person who has been poisoned warrants careful consideration of multiple factors, and those exhibiting signs or symptoms of toxicity must be monitored longer.

### National estimates of ENDS liquid nicotine exposures, U.S., 2013–2017 [^3fa0f9b6]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Increased use of ENDS in the U.S. is related to acute adverse events from liquid nicotine exposure. This paper provides national estimates of U.S. hospital emergency department visits for exposures from liquid nicotine exposure in individuals aged ≥ 5 years.

Methods

In 2018–2019, data from the 2013–2017 National Electronic Injury Surveillance System All Injury Program were used to identify cases of liquid nicotine-related exposures in individuals aged ≥ 5 years. National estimates of exposures related to liquid nicotine exposure in ENDS for those aged ≥ 5 years by demographic characteristics, symptoms, diagnoses, and treatment dispositions were calculated.

Results

From 2013 to 2017, an estimated 2,718 cases related to liquid nicotine among those aged ≥ 5 years were treated in U.S. hospital emergency departments. Most exposures occurred among those who were aged ≥ 25 years (51.7%), white (74.1%), and male (51.9%). Most case patients were treated and released from the hospitals, and 7.5% were admitted. Poisoning was the most common diagnosis of these exposures (82.7%). The most common symptoms were cardiovascular (29.7%).

Conclusions

This study provides national estimates of emergency department visits for injury and poisoning cases related to nicotine exposure from ENDS among individuals aged ≥ 5 years. Although long-term health outcome studies of liquid nicotine exposure are not available, these estimates provide some insight into the acute health effects. Findings from this study may inform education programs aimed at preventing exposures related to ENDS products.

### Nicotine (nicotrol) [^0c76948d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

The oral LD50for nicotine is > 5 mg/kg in dogs and > 24 mg/kg in rodents. Death is due to respiratory paralysis. The oral minimum acute lethal dose for nicotine in adult humans is reported to be 40 to 60 mg (< 1 mg/kg). A full bottle of NICOTROL NS contains 100 mg of nicotine.

Doses of nicotine that are tolerated by adult smokers during treatment may produce severe signs and symptoms of poisoning in children and may prove fatal. Suspected nicotine poisoning in a child should be considered a medical emergency and treated immediately (See WARNINGS, Safety Note Concerning Children).

NICOTROL NS would be expected to be irritating if sprayed in the eyes, mouth or ears. Eye exposure should be treated with copious irrigation with water for 20 minutes. Large oral nicotine ingestions cause vomiting and the consequences of an overdose will vary; should this occur, patients should contact their physician immediately. For additional emergency information, call your regional poison center.

Signs and Symptoms of Nicotine Toxicity

Signs and symptoms of an overdose of NICOTROL NS would be expected to be the same as those of acute nicotine poisoning including: pallor, cold sweat, nausea, salivation, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, disturbed hearing and vision, tremor, mental confusion, and weakness. Prostration, hypotension, arrhythmia, and respiratory failure may ensue with large overdoses. Lethal doses produce convulsions quickly and death follows as a result of peripheral or central respiratory paralysis or, less frequently, cardiac failure.

Overdose from Ingestion

If emesis has not occurred, it should be induced in conscious patients with a suitable emetic followed by an appropriate dose of activated charcoal. In unconscious patients with a secure airway, instill activated charcoal via a nasogastric tube. A saline cathartic or sorbitol may be added to the first dose of activated charcoal.

Management of Nicotine Poisoning

Administration of nicotine must be stopped immediately and the patient should be treated symptomatically. Other supportive measures include diazepam or barbiturates for seizures, atropine for excessive bronchial secretions or diarrhea, respiratory support for respiratory failure, and vigorous fluid support for hypotension and cardiovascular collapse.

### Nicotine and tobacco as substances of abuse in children and adolescents [^57cac0a2]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute nicotine toxicity in children and exposures from electronic nicotine delivery systems are characterized by ingestion sources, rising poison center calls, dose thresholds, and prevention guidance. Children can ingest nicotine from tobacco products and some insecticides, and most such incidents occur in children younger than 6 years. Electronic nicotine delivery systems with refillable cartridges have become a source of accidental exposure to a concentrated nicotine solution. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported e-cigarette liquid-related calls increased from 1 per month (September 2010) to 215 per month (February 2014), with more than half (51.1%) involving children younger than 5 years; a death of a child who ingested the concentrated nicotine solution was reported. Early symptoms include a burning sensation in the mouth and throat, nausea, vomiting, confusion, dizziness, weakness, and drooling from increased salivation; severe poisoning leads to arrhythmias, coma, convulsions, and cardiac arrest. The lethal dose of nicotine has been estimated to be as little as 50 to 60 mg in adults, whereas in children it is probably much lower, between 1 and 13 mg/kg, with severe toxic reactions reported with doses as low as 2 mg. Nicotine liquid refills are available in various strengths ranging from 6 (0.6%) to 36 (3.6%) mg/mL; assuming there are 20 drops in 1 mL, 1 drop of 3.6% nicotine liquid will contain 1.8 mg nicotine. The dose estimated to be lethal for 50% of adults is between 0.8 and 13.0 mg/kg; the ingestion of a few drops of concentrated solution is enough to cause severe symptoms in young children, and for example, the ingestion of 1 to 2 drops of a 3.6% solution (1.8–3.6 mg) will put most children younger than 5 years in this category. Thus, children who have ingested ≥ 0.2 mg/kg of nicotine would be expected to be symptomatic and will need medical assessment. Refill liquids may also contain oil of wintergreen (methyl salicylate), glycerin, and propylene glycol, which could cause multiple toxidromes, including salicylism and cholinergic crisis. The risk posed by nicotine liquid to children is an important anticipatory guidance topic to discuss with parents and caregivers, and preventive measures to reduce toxic ingestions include public education and legislation to improve container safety through limited volumes and child-proof packaging.

### Vaping-related injury and illness among Canadian children and adolescents: a one-time survey of paediatric providers [^b11e5aa4]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2020). High credibility.

A one-time survey distributed to 2693 Canadian paediatricians enrolled in the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Programme was conducted between October and December 2019. We identified a wide range of severe vaping-related injuries and illnesses among children ages 0–17 (n = 88), which were associated with the routine use or malfunctioning of a vaping device or the ingestion of vaping substances. The most common clinical presentations were acute respiratory symptoms and nicotine toxicity and 15% (n = 13) of injuries required intensive care unit admission. Our study highlights the urgent need for substantive policy measures to help protect youth against the risks associated with vaping products.

### Nicotine: systemic agent… [^53459c7f]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Signs/Symptoms Nicotine poisoning typically produces toxicity in two phases: stimulation/excitation followed quickly by inhibition/depression. Some patient/victims may only exhibit late phase effects. Onset of physical effects is dependent on route of exposure. Early phase findings occur within 15 minutes to 1 hour. Vomiting is the most common symptom of nicotine poisoning. Late phase findings occur within 30 minutes to 4 hours. The duration of symptoms is about 1 to 2 hours following mild exposure, and up to 18 to 24 hours following severe exposure. Death may occur within 1 hour after severe exposure. At low concentrations, nicotine causes tremor and increases in heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and level of alertness.

More severe exposures cause muscle fasciculations, seizures, and abnormal heart rhythms; these effects are followed by multi-system organ depression including slow heart rate, low blood pressure, and paralysis of the muscles that control breathing. Vomiting occurs in more then 50% of symptomatic patient/victims. Death may occur, and is typically due to paralysis of the muscles that control breathing, a build-up of fluid in the airways, and failure of the heart and blood vessels.
- Irritation and redness.
- **Early phase**: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and increased salivation; fluid build-up in the airways; rapid, heavy breathing; high blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and generalized narrowing of the blood vessels with pale skin; and headache, dizziness, confusion, agitation, restlessness, loss of balance and difficulty walking, and visual and hearing distortions.
- **Late phase**: diarrhea; shallow breathing, no breathing, low blood pressure, slow heart rate, abnormal heart rhythms, and shock; and loss of normal reflexes, loss of normal muscle tone, lethargy, weakness, paralysis, and coma.

### Type 1 Brugada pattern associated with nicotine toxicity [^bd1114c3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Brugada pattern (BrP) findings on electrocardiogram (ECG) are mandatory for the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome (BrS). BrS is an incompletely understood cause of sudden cardiac death.

Case Report

Our patient was a young woman who was using topical nicotine for assistance in smoking cessation at a relatively high dose compared to her daily cigarette intake. She presented with symptoms of mild nicotine toxicity and had an ECG with a type 1 BrP. An ECG the next day was normal and electrophysiology consultation was conducted. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Recognition of a BrP ECG by emergency physicians is critical because this is the first step in diagnosing BrS, a condition that is characterized by ventricular dysrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. In addition, ECG abnormalities can be transient in nature, requiring vigilance by the emergency physician to prevent the patients' potential life threat from going undiagnosed. We present the first case to our knowledge of a BrP associated with nicotine toxicity. We also discuss treatment and disposition recommendations.

### E-cigarettes and similar devices [^63b7c17a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Poisonings and injuries — Unintentional exposure to and poisoning from e-cigarette solutions containing nicotine have increased dramatically in the United States since 2011. Although symptoms of acute nicotine toxicity are generally mild and resolve within 12 hours with no treatment, large exposure can be fatal, and one child death caused by ingestion of liquid nicotine has been reported in the United States. The Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act of 2015, enacted nationally in January 2016, requires child-resistant packaging for liquid nicotine, yet there continue to be thousands of reports of exposure to e-cigarette liquid nicotine yearly to the National Poison Data System. In addition, lithium-ion batteries used in e-cigarettes have exploded, leading to burns and fires.

### Electronic nicotine delivery systems [^0f75d81c]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Unintentional ENDS exposure and toxicity — nicotine is well absorbed from the respiratory tract, mucosal surfaces, skin, and intestines; thus, exposure can occur from inhaling, ingesting, or physical contact with nicotine-containing ENDS solution. Although symptoms of acute nicotine toxicity are generally mild and resolve within 12 hours with no treatment, large exposures can be fatal, and severe poisonings generally have a biphasic reaction with early symptoms within the first hour of exposure characterized by cholinergic excess and late symptoms between 0.5 and 4 hours including hypotension, bradycardia, lethargy, and respiratory failure secondary to neuromuscular blockade. Severe nicotine toxicity in children has been reported with doses as low as 2 mg; ENDS solutions have been advertised to contain as much as 36 mg/mL of nicotine (3.6%), and the oral lethal dose of nicotine is projected at between 0.8 and 13 mg/kg, with a mid-range estimate of 6 mg/kg implying that ingestion of 2 mL (< 0.5 teaspoon) of concentrated nicotine solution could be fatal to the average 12-kg, 20-month-old child. Calls to poison control centers for ENDS exposures increased from 1 exposure call per month in September 2010 to 215 calls in February 2014, the majority among children 0 to 5 years of age, and 57.8% of exposures produced adverse health effects. As of publication, there has been 1 reported child death from ingestion and 1 adult death from an intentional injection of a nicotine-containing ENDS solution in the United States, and lithium-ion batteries in ENDS have reportedly caused explosions and fires, with the US Fire Administration cautioning that battery failure may be more likely to result in an explosion propelled like a "flaming rocket".

### Recognition of illness associated with exposure to chemical agents – United States, 2003 [^7f3caf53]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2003). Low credibility.

Since September 11, 2001, concern has increased about potential terrorist attacks involving the use of chemical agents. In addition, recent cases involving intentional or inadvertent contamination of food with chemicals have highlighted the need for health-care providers and public health officials to be alert for patients in their communities who have signs and symptoms consistent with chemical exposures. For example, in February 2003, a Michigan supermarket worker was charged with intentionally contaminating 200 lbs. of meat with a nicotine-containing insecticide. Although intentional release of chemical agents might be an overt event (i.e., one whose nature reveals itself), such as release of a nerve agent in a subway or a large explosion of a chemical container, a chemical release might instead be a covert event (i.e., an unrecognized release in which the presence of ill persons might be the first sign of an exposure), such as deliberate contamination of food, water, or a consumer product. To increase the likelihood that health-care providers will recognize a chemical-release-related illness and that public health authorities will implement the appropriate emergency response and public health actions, CDC identified examples of chemical-induced illness and created appropriate guidance for health-care providers and public health personnel. This report summarizes the epidemiologic clues and clinical signs or patterns of illness that might suggest covert release of a chemical agent. CDC is working to develop national surveillance capabilities for detecting chemical-release-related illnesses.

E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) clinical care — clinical presentation describes that EVALI typically presents as an acute or subacute respiratory illness with nonspecific symptoms including shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, and/or hemoptysis. Most patients also have gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea and/or constitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, fatigue, and/or weight loss. Symptoms develop over days to weeks, and laboratory findings are nonspecific and may include elevated white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

Results

Baseline Characteristics

Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics, vaping exposures, and clinical characteristics of the 31 patients. Most were White individuals (27 [87%]) and men (24 [77%]), with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 24 (21–31) years. Most (29 [94%]) reported vaping tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) either alone (12 [39%]) or in combination or alternation with nicotine (17 [55%]). Frequency of THC vaping was difficult to quantify due to a number of factors, including variable qualities of vaping histories obtained, patients omitting or underreporting actual usage due to the use of illicit substances, and a range of usage frequencies reported, such as a few times per day to almost continuous use. Few patients reported changes in the frequency of their vaping temporally related to their illness; however, many did report subjective changes they noticed in the quality of the products they were using, be it taste or even visual assessment of the viscosity of the liquid. All patients presented with at least 1 symptom from the following categories: respiratory (30 [97%]), constitutional (28 [90%]), or gastrointestinal (28 [90%]); 24 (77%) had symptoms from all these categories. The most common individual symptoms within each category were dyspnea (30 [97%]) and cough (25 [81%]); fever (28 [90%]) and chills (20 [65%]); and nausea (27 [87%]) and vomiting (24 [77%]).

### An epidemiologic and clinical description of e-cigarette toxicity [^0da20581]. Clinical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

E-cigarettes are battery-powered electronic nicotine delivery systems that simulate smoking by vaporizing nicotine-containing solutions. Systematic published data on e-liquid toxicity and exposures are limited to case reports and retrospective studies. Prospectively-collected data on the type of exposure, symptomatology, duration of symptoms, and concentration/flavor of e-fluids has not been published.

Methods

This was a prospective observational study over a 42-month period (07/01/2014–12/31/2017). For all calls to a single poison center that involved e-cigarette devices or refill fluid, a data collection instrument was filled out by the specialist in poison information (SPI).

Results

Two hundred sixty-five total cases were identified, including 193 children and 72 adults. The majority of both pediatric (72%; 139/193) and adult (61%; n = 44/72) exposures involved e-liquid refill containers or fluid. Fifty-six percent (n = 108/193) of pediatric exposures involved ingestion of refill liquid. Though children who ingested e-liquid received only a small amount, initial symptoms were evident in 32% (n = 35/108) of cases. Children who did not ingest or inhale the products were less likely to develop toxicity. Only 2 children who were asymptomatic on initial call became symptomatic on follow-up. Most patients symptoms resolved within 4hours. Seventy-one specific products/brands were identified with nicotine concentrations ranging from 0mg/mL to 60mg/mL with one product containing 3000mg in a single bottle. A variety of flavors were identified, including several with names that may be attractive to toddlers or adolescents.

Discussion

E-cig exposures tend to produce irritant effects from topical exposures and nicotine toxicity from ingestions, as well as some dermal and "sucking" toddler exposures.

Conclusion

Exposure to e-cig fluid or device frequently causes mild symptoms and rarely may produce systemic nicotine toxicity.

### An update on controversies in e-cigarettes [^93148454]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

E-cigarettes are electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) which mimic tobacco smoking without the combustion of tobacco. These devices have been misleadingly marketed as "less harmful" alternatives to conventional smoking tobacco products. The e-liquid in e-cigarettes include nicotine, a humectant and other additives including flavourings, colourants, or adulterants such as bacterial and fungal products. In this review, we discuss the contrasting views of the tobacco lobby and most professional societies. We describe the epidemiology of the use of these devices, with a widespread and significant rise in youth e-cigarette use seen in both the USA and Europe. We also describe what is known about the toxicity and mechanisms of EVALI (e-cigarette or vaping associated lung injury). This characterised by respiratory failure with an intense inflammatory response. The presentations are diverse and clinicians should consider vaping as a possible cause of any unusual respiratory illness in patients who have a history of vaping or other use of e-cigarette-related products. Second hand exposure to e-cigarettes is also harmful through respiration and transdermal absorption. E-cigarettes have a worse acute toxicity than tobacco and their long-term toxicity is unknown, and we advocate for the immediate, most vigorous anti-vaping legislation possible.

### Acute respiratory failure associated with vaping [^d2935c25]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

The use of e-cigarettes to deliver aerosolized nicotine has gained popularity in recent years. Numerous reports have cited the development of acute pulmonary disease linked to vaping nicotine as well as marijuana-based products. As cultural attitudes evolve and policies shift toward the legalization of marijuana, its use has become more prevalent. Given the increased prevalence of marijuana consumption and e-cigarette usage, better insight into its potential to cause lung toxicity is warranted. The clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic characteristics of lung injury associated with vaping, particularly with marijuana-based products, have yet to be well described in the literature. We present eight patients, most of whom were admitted recently to our institution with acute respiratory failure following vaping. The majority of patients were young, with a median age of 31.5 years (range, 24–62 years) and with no known underlying lung disease. This case series highlights common clinical findings as well as the varied radiographic and histopathologic features of acute respiratory failure associated with vaping predominantly marijuana-based products. As more cases of vaping-associated pulmonary injury unfold, data will be available to further characterize this emerging disease entity. Improved understanding of disease pathogenesis and its clinical course will help clinicians determine optimal management and follow-up strategies for this patient population.

### E-cigarettes, vaping devices, and acute lung injury [^4154a0c0]. Respiratory Care (2020). Medium credibility.

"E-cigarettes" are a class of consumer devices designed to deliver drugs, primarily nicotine or marijuana oils, to the lung by vaporization. Regulation of the devices in the United States is relatively minimal, and research on both epidemiology and potential toxicity has focused on nicotine devices. In 2019, an outbreak of an acute respiratory illness in the United States was traced back to the contamination of e-cigarette fluids with vitamin E acetate, which had been used to disguise the dilution of marijuana oils. The outbreak, termed "e-cigarette or vaping associated lung injury" by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, was characterized by pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia, which usually required hospitalization and, often, admission to ICUs. The syndrome sickened > 2,600 people, mostly young men, and killed > 50 people before it began to abate 6 months later. No current regulations exist to prevent a similar event with the same or different chemical contaminants. Absent such regulation, respiratory practitioners should be prepared to evaluate, identify, and treat future cases of acute lung toxicity from e-cigarettes.

### Update: interim guidance for health care providers evaluating and caring for patients with suspected E-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury-United States, October 2019 [^64266cf0]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

As of October 8, 2019, 49 states, the District of Columbia, and one territorial health department have reported 1,299 cases of EVALI to CDC, with 26 deaths reported from 21 states (median age of death = 49 years, range = 17–75 years). Among 1,043 patients with available data on age and sex, 70% were male, and the median age was 24 years (range = 13–75 years); 80% were aged < 35 years, and 15% were aged < 18 years. Among 573 patients who reported information on substances used in e-cigarette, or vaping, products in the 90 days preceding symptom onset, 76% reported using THC-containing products, and 58% reported using nicotine-containing products; 32% reported exclusive use of THC-containing products, and 13% reported exclusive use of nicotine-containing products.* No single compound or ingredient has emerged as the cause of these injuries to date, and there might be more than one cause. Available data suggest THC-containing products play a role in this outbreak, but the specific chemical or chemicals responsible for EVALI have not yet been identified, and nicotine-containing products have not been excluded as a possible cause.

Ongoing federal and state investigations have provided information about the clinical characteristics of cases and a surveillance case definition for confirmed and probable cases has been developed; this case definition † is not intended to guide clinical care. To inform CDC's updated interim clinical guidance, on October 2, 2019, CDC obtained individual expert perspectives on the evaluation and treatment of patients with suspected EVALI. Discussions occurred with nine national experts in adult and pediatric pulmonary medicine and critical care who were designated by professional medical societies to participate (Lung Injury Response Clinical Working Group). Evidence supporting CDC's recommendations include data from medical abstractions reported to CDC, previously published case series, and the aforementioned individual expert opinions.

### Nicotiana glauca (tree tobacco) intoxication – two cases in one family [^f28682d1]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

We present two cases of rare human poisoning in one family following ingestion of cooked leaves from the tobacco tree plant, Nicotiana glauca. The toxic principle of N. glauca, anabasine (C10H14N2), is a small pyridine alkaloid, similar in both structure and effects to nicotine, but appears to be more potent in humans. A 73-year-old female tourist from France, without remarkable medical history, collapsed at home following a few hours long prodrome of dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and malaise. The symptoms developed shortly after eating N. glauca cooked leaves that were collected around her daughter's house in Jerusalem and mistaken for wild spinach. She was found unconscious, with dilated pupils and extreme bradycardia. Following resuscitation and respiratory support, circulation was restored. However, she did not regain consciousness and died 20 days after admission because of multi-organ failure. Anabasine was identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method in N. glauca leaves and in the patient's urine. Simultaneously, her 18-year-old grandson developed weakness and myalgia after ingesting a smaller amount of the same meal. He presented to the same emergency room in a stable condition. His exam was remarkable only for sinus bradycardia. He was discharged without any specific treatment. He recovered in 24 h without any residual sequelae. These cases raise an awareness of the potential toxicity caused by ingestion of tobacco tree leaves and highlight the dangers of ingesting botanicals by lay public. Moreover, they add to the clinical spectrum of N. glauca intoxication.

### Initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^8155c819]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Although there was unanimity among the panel regarding the preferred intervention, four panelists (H.J.F. P.G. S. Pakhale, and M.C.P.) advocated for a strong, rather than conditional, recommendation. They were concerned about the safety and effectiveness of electronic cigarettes because of reports that were not included in the evidence synthesis. They cited reports of deaths or disability due to electronic cigarette– or vaping-associated lung injury, burns due to product explosion, acute nicotine poisoning, and seizures, as well as histopathologic injuries in laboratory studies. They noted that such concerns have prompted warnings about electronic cigarettes from numerous organizations, as described below (,–). Two nonvoting panelists later joined the dissent (P.F. T.L.), but these panelists were unavailable to participate in the panel discussions of the evidence or the formulation and grading of the recommendation.

Recommendation 4

For tobacco-dependent adults, we suggest varenicline over electronic cigarettes (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the estimated effects). Remarks: The recommendation's strength reflects very low certainty in the effects used to derive the recommendation. After our evidence synthesis, new evidence emerged regarding serious adverse effects of electronic cigarettes. If these serious adverse effects continue to be reported, the strength of the recommendation should be reevaluated. Note that this recommendation is intended for treatment of tobacco dependence under the supervision of a clinician; it should not be extrapolated to unsupervised treatment or recreational use.

Drug toxicity syndromes — serotonin syndrome, NMS, malignant hyperthermia, and anticholinergic poisoning — are contrasted by time of onset, temperature patterns, and neuromuscular findings. All of these drug toxicity syndromes can present with altered mental status, autonomic dysfunction, and neuromuscular abnormalities as manifested by abnormal vital signs including fever, hypertension, and tachycardia. Onset differs across syndromes: serotonin syndrome occurs in minutes to hours, usual 6–24 h; NMS evolves over days, usual 1–7 d; malignant hyperthermia develops over hours, usual < 12 h; and anticholinergic poisoning presents in minutes to hours, usual 0.5–24 h. Temperature thresholds shown are elevated (≤ 41.1°C) for serotonin syndrome, elevated (≤ 41.1°C) for NMS, elevated (≤ 46°C) for malignant hyperthermia, and mild elevation (< 38.8°C) for anticholinergic poisoning. Neuromuscular findings include hyperreflexic clonus in serotonin syndrome and "Lead pipe" rigidity in NMS.

### Nicotine (nicotrol) [^9add507d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Nicotine from any source can be toxic and addictive. Smoking causes lung disease, cancer, and heart disease and may adversely affect pregnant women or the fetus. For any smoker, with or without concomitant disease or pregnancy, the risk of nicotine replacement in a smoking cessation program should be weighed against the hazard of continued smoking, and the likelihood of achieving cessation of smoking without nicotine replacement.

Pregnancy, Warning

Tobacco smoke, which has been shown to be harmful to the fetus, contains nicotine, hydrogen cyanide, and carbon monoxide. Nicotine has been shown in animal studies to cause fetal harm. It is therefore presumed that NICOTROL NS can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The effect of nicotine delivery by NICOTROL NS has not been examined in pregnancy (See PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy). Therefore, pregnant smokers should be encouraged to attempt cessation using educational and behavioral interventions before using pharmacological approaches. If NICOTROL NS is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while using it, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.

Safety Note Concerning Children

The amounts of nicotine that are tolerated by adult smokers can produce signs and symptoms of poisoning and could prove fatal if NICOTROL NS is used or ingested by children or pets. Suspected nicotine poisoning in a child should be considered a medical emergency and treated immediately. A full bottle of NICOTROL NS contains 100 mg of nicotine, some of which will still be in the bottle when it is discarded. Therefore, patients should be cautioned to keep both used and unused containers of NICOTROL NS out of the reach of children and pets.

### Internet suicide guidelines: report of a life-threatening poisoning using tobacco extract [^55316012]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Severe nicotine intoxication occurred in a patient after ingestion of a tobacco extract made from a recipe found on a freely available Internet site.

Objectives

To determine the levels of nicotine and cotinine in the plasma of a patient who tried to commit suicide by drinking a highly concentrated tobacco extract.

Case Report

A 67-year-old man tried to commit suicide by following guidelines found on an Internet site. He soaked 300 grams of tobacco for 3 days in water, evaporated most of the extract, and drank the rest of it. He felt sick immediately, with the following signs: respiratory depression, hypothermia, hypersalivation, bradycardia, and myoclonic jerks. Soon after the ingestion he vomited most of the extract. Toxicological analysis revealed potentially life-threatening nicotine and cotinine serum concentrations. Surprisingly, nicotine peak levels (322 microg/L) and cotinine peak levels (9092 microg/L) were reached more than 3 h after ingestion of the extract. Estimated nicotine and cotinine half-lives were 200 min and 1185 min, respectively. Treatment consisted of gastric lavage, ventilation, and monitoring of vital functions. The patient recovered and was discharged from the Emergency Department 4 days later without sequelae.

Conclusion

Nicotinergic intoxication is not always easy to recognize, and without clues from the patient and the toxicologic analysis, might well have been missed in the present case.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^9528e984]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Patient evaluation — stimulant intoxication and withdrawal should begin with triage for acute complications, noting that no studies were identified that evaluated strategies for diagnosing or assessing stimulant intoxication or withdrawal and that recommendations are based on other guidelines and clinical expertise. In non-acute care settings, clinicians should conduct an initial assessment to identify any acute issues and complications, and a basic assessment of vital signs and focused mental status evaluation can determine the need for urgent or emergent treatment or referral. In acute toxicologic emergencies, standard management involves responding to urgent and emergent signs and symptoms, and completion of laboratory or toxicology tests should not preclude or delay initiating supportive treatment for suspected acute stimulant intoxication or withdrawal. After urgent concerns are addressed, patients should be given or referred for a comprehensive assessment including a stimulant-focused history and physical examination with relevant collateral information when available and an assessment of non-acute complications and sequelae; the extent of exam and medical workup should be based on presenting signs and symptoms and severity, clinical testing should be based on the history and physical exam findings, and a safety assessment of risk of harm to self and others should also be conducted.

### Gastrointestinal manifestations of synthetic cannabinoids: a retrospective cohort study [^89f2e617]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is, to our knowledge, the first study specifically dealing with the GI symptoms of SC use in an acute setting. Among symptomatic SC users presenting to the ED, 38% had GI manifestations and abdominal pain was reported by of those with GI symptoms. Still, the clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging findings ranged in severity among these patients. Most patients had only mild abdominal pain, while others had severe elevations of serum lactate with one patient having suffered an intestinal perforation. Nevertheless, the vast majority of patients (20/21) had a complete resolution of abdominal pain and normalization of serum lactate levels within a few hours of presentation.

When comparing the differences between the patients with GI symptoms and those without, there were no statistically significant differences in their prognoses, clinical severity, or laboratory values. Lack of significant difference may have been due to their low numbers. However, the patients with GI manifestations had higher lactate levels likely caused by the intestinal involvement and more patients with severe leukocytosis. The mechanism causing the varied effects of SC on the GI tract is unclear, but may be related to a previously reported effect of THC and cannabidiol on CBr1 and CBr2, which influence GI function, motility, and sensation. Our study suggests that SC GI symptoms are unpredictable and can vary from minimal, or no symptoms to intestinal perforation and death. This varied GI response to SC may be due to the varying potency of SC, especially with the development of new ultra-potent SC that may impact the GI tract more than regular cannabis. Others have suggested that the variability of SC on the GI tract may be due to adulterants added to the compounds (such as caffeine, nicotine, and tramadol), which can contribute to clinical effects and toxicity.

### The treatment of acute nicotine poisoning… [^86037f74]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The fact that an individual poisoned with nicotine is rarely seen by the physician in time to institute treatment is not a sufficient reason for a lack of knowledge as to what may be done to save life when the opportunity is at hand. Except for the usual procedures to remove any unabsorbed poison and the administration of stimulants, we have been unable to find in the literature any description of a rational treatment for nicotine poisoning. Generally the condition is considered hopeless. This pessimistic attitude is apparently due to the belief that the drug causes generalized paralysis of the central nervous system, based on the fact that complete muscular paralysis, loss of reflexes and paralysis of respiration follow its absorption in sufficiently large doses. As Moore and Rowe1 have pointed out, all these effects could as readily be due to the curare-like action of the drug as to central paralysis.

As a result of experiments on dogs, 2 we are convinced that death from nicotine poisoning is due to peripheral paralysis of the respiratory muscles when convulsions are prevented, and, if these occur, to fixation of the respiratory muscles.

### Characteristics of persons who report using only nicotine-containing products among interviewed patients with E-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury-Illinois, August-December 2019 [^0d0218b6]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Among the 121 EVALI patients included in this analysis, nine (7%) reported using only nicotine-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, products and had no indication of any THC use. EVALI patients who had no indication of any THC use were more likely to be older and female and less likely to have constitutional symptoms and an initial leukocytosis and to have seen an outpatient provider before hospitalization. Vitamin E acetate has been strongly linked to the EVALI outbreak; however, before the current EVALI outbreak, there have been case reports of lung injury associated with nicotine-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, product use. Along with a longstanding baseline rate of emergency department visits from e-cigarette, or vaping, product use identified from syndromic surveillance, these findings suggest that some EVALI cases might be associated with the use of nicotine-containing products. Given the different demographics, clinical presentations, and the lack of any indication of exposure to THC-containing products, the contributing cause or causes of EVALI for persons using only nicotine-containing products might differ from the majority of EVALI patients and warrants further investigation.

### Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) liquid nicotine exposure in children under 5 years of age presenting to U.S. emergency departments, 2019–2024 [^2490de59]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) have become widely popular, inadvertently increasing the risk of pediatric liquid nicotine exposures. Even small amounts of concentrated nicotine can result in severe toxicity in young children. This study aimed to quantify emergency department visits for liquid nicotine poisoning among children under five years of age from 2019 to 2024.

Methods

Data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) from 2019 to 2024 were analyzed using a cross-sectional approach. Cases were identified by extracting records with poisoning diagnoses and filtering narratives using keywords associated with ENDS poisonings. Two independent reviewers confirmed each case involved exposure to ENDS liquid nicotine. NEISS sample weights were applied to produce national estimates with 95% confidence intervals.

Results

An estimated 3,952 emergency department visits nationally (95% CI: 2,600–5,305) were attributed to liquid nicotine poisoning among children under five years of age from 2019–2024. Children under two years accounted for 2,921 cases (73.9%). Males represented 2,345 cases (59.3%) and females 1,607 cases (40.7%). White children comprised 2,345 cases (59.3%). Most children (88.3%) were treated and released, while 165 cases (4.2%) required hospital admission. No fatalities were reported.

Conclusion

Liquid nicotine poisoning remains a significant pediatric health concern, with over 3,900 emergency department visits nationally during 2019–2024. Children under two years of age are at highest risk due to developmental factors and exploratory behaviors. While most cases did not require hospitalization, the potential for serious outcomes underscores the need for enhanced prevention strategies, including improved product packaging and public education about safe storage practices.

### Nicotine intoxication by e-cigarette liquids: a study of case reports and pathophysiology [^8dfdb734]. Clinical Toxicology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), the smokeless alternative to conventional tobacco cigarettes, have become increasingly popular. E-cigarettes vaporise e-liquid, a solution of highly concentrated nicotine, propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerine (VG). With the popularity of e-cigarettes, e-liquid refills have become easily accessible and several cases of intoxication due to the ingestion of e-liquid have been reported. We provide an overview of these cases, their pathophysiology and patients' characteristics. Methods: We carried out a retrospective evaluation of the scientific literature reporting on cases of liquid nicotine intoxication, using the following inclusion criteria: (1) the article is or contains a case report, (2) describes an intoxication with e-liquid, (3) the substance contains nicotine, and (4) intake is oral, intravenous or subcutaneous. Results: We found 26 case reports describing a total of 31 patients who suffered from e-liquid intoxication. All intoxications up to the age of six were reported as unintentional, whereas nearly all cases from ages 13 to 53 were due to suicide attempts. The three most prevalent symptoms of e-liquid intoxication were tachycardia, altered mental status and vomiting. Eleven cases resulted in the death of the patient. In the survivors, the highest plasma concentration of nicotine was 800µgL -1, while the lowest concentration in the non-survivors was 1600µgL -1. Conclusions: There is a mismatch between the generally accepted lethal oral nicotine dose of 60mg, resulting in approximately 180µgL -1 plasma concentration, and the 4.4- to 8.9-fold higher lethal plasma concentrations we found in cases of e-liquid intoxication. In these severe intoxications, plasma cotinine concentration does not act as a more reliable indicator of nicotine intoxication than nicotine itself. The ages of the patients display a bimodal distribution. In patients above the age of 10, intoxication results mainly from suicide attempts rather than accidental ingestion. The role of PG and VG in e-liquid intoxications is remarkably unclear. However, the similarity across nicotine and PG toxicity symptoms leads us to believe a cumulative effect cannot be excluded.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^9032b2d9]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Assessment and initial assessment — stimulant use disorder (StUD) state that StUD is primarily diagnosed based on the history provided by the patient and a comprehensive assessment that may include collection of information from collateral sources, such as family or friends, when available and with patient consent; subsequent workup (eg, ordering indicated clinical testing and/or imaging) should be based on the history and clinical exam findings, and the extent of the clinical exam and medical workup for stimulant intoxication and withdrawal can be based on presenting signs and symptoms and severity of intoxication or withdrawal. When assessing patients for StUD, the first clinical priority should be to identify any urgent or emergent biomedical or psychiatric signs or symptoms that may be present and make appropriate referrals, and acute issues, including signs of acute intoxication or overdose, need to be addressed immediately.

### Nicotine-induced bullous fixed drug eruption [^582014b4]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Histopathologic examination of skin biopsy in FDE typically reveals subepidermal vesiculation with hydropic degeneration of the basal layer and scattered necrotic keratinocytes within the epidermis. Interface dermatitis is frequently present with an inflammatory infiltrate typically consisting of lymphocytes and eosinophils. Macrophage phagocytosis of melanosomes from necrosed keratinocytes causes pigmentary incontinence, resulting in hyperpigmented macules clinically following resolution of acute skin lesions.

The histologic differential diagnosis of FDE commonly includes other interface dermatitides with prominent dyskeratosis, including EM and Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis. There is significant histologic overlap of these conditions, although FDE typically presents with a more mixed inflammatory infiltrate, including eosinophils and sometimes neutrophils. Clinical features can also help to differentiate among these related entities. Necrotic lesions in FDE can closely resemble the classic targetoid lesions of EM. However, close examination of FDE lesions will not reveal the typical targetoid lesions, composed of three distinct zones, observed in EM. While severe forms of generalized bullous FDE can closely resemble Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, the former often lacks the constitutional symptoms and severe systemic effects of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis.

Despite having no exposure to the classic causative medications, we believe the combined clinicopathologic findings in this case represent a nicotine-induced FDE. Throughout his five-year history of symptoms, the patient has consistently experienced relapse within days to a week of resuming smoking or using other nicotine-containing products, such as gum or patches, even in the absence of smoking. His lesions frequently occur on similar areas of the body, though his episodes have demonstrated minor variability in lesion distribution along the extremities. His lesions to date have not developed the characteristic hyperpigmentation following resolution of acute exacerbation; however, cases of non-pigmenting FDE have previously been reported. The patient has failed to develop significant systemic effects during these episodes, a finding that also favors FDE over the other entities discussed above.

### Scopolamine (transderm scop) [^e8f7eac9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Anticholinergic toxicity includes both central and peripheral signs and symptoms: agitation, central nervous system effects (e.g., coma, confusion, hallucinations, lethargy, seizures, somnolence), decreased bowel sounds, dry flushed skin, dry mouth, hyperthermia, hypertension, supraventricular arrhythmias, tachycardia, urinary retention, visual disturbances (e.g., amblyopia, mydriasis). These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention.

In cases of toxicity remove the TRANSDERM SCŌP transdermal system. Serious symptomatic cases of overdosage involving multiple transdermal system applications and/or ingestion may be managed by initially ensuring the patient has an adequate airway and supporting respiration and circulation. This should be rapidly followed by removal of all transdermal systems from the skin and the mouth. If there is evidence of transdermal system ingestion, endoscopic removal of swallowed transdermal systems, or administration of activated charcoal should be considered, as indicated by the clinical situation. In any case where there is serious overdosage or signs of evolving acute toxicity, continuous monitoring of vital signs and ECG, establishment of intravenous access, and administration of oxygen are all recommended.

The signs and symptoms of overdose/toxicity due to scopolamine should be carefully distinguished from the occasionally observed syndrome of withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Although mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both acute toxicity and withdrawal, other characteristic findings differ: tachyarrhythmias, dry skin, and decreased bowel sounds suggest anticholinergic toxicity, while bradycardia, headache, nausea and abdominal cramps, and sweating suggest post-removal withdrawal.

If over-exposure occurs, call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage.

### Overview of pathologic findings of vaping in the context of an autopsy patient with chronic injury [^48050f97]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Context —

Electronic cigarettes are handheld devices that heat an inner liquid containing chemicals to be aerosolized and inhaled, and have become a popular alternative to conventional cigarettes. Their use, termed vaping, has been linked to severe injury, with 2711 cases of associated lung injury and 60 deaths reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the time of writing. Published case reports and series have emerged detailing clinical and imaging characteristics of vaping-induced lung injury. However, the pathologic characteristics of these induced injuries are still being established, particularly findings occurring over time.

Objective —

To illustrate the autopsy findings of an older patient who died of vaping-induced injury after prolonged symptomology and to provide a review of the most recent literature regarding the basic science, epidemiology, clinical presentation, imaging characteristics, and pathology of vaping-induced lung injury.

Data Sources —

Autopsy case and peer-reviewed literature.

Conclusions —

Vaping-induced lung injury has emerged as a public health issue, and this case represents a rare opportunity to evaluate this issue at autopsy. Most commonly, the injury has been attributed to tetrahydrocannabinol product use as opposed to nicotine. This case demonstrates that as today's young and relatively healthy "vapers" grow older and develop the comorbidities that come with advanced age, there is serious risk of chronic lung damage from vaping that could result in death. Further observations and studies, particularly autopsy evidence, are clearly important to understand the possible outcomes.

According to medical chart abstraction data reported to CDC on nonhospitalized EVALI patients' initial outpatient medical visit, 85% (47 of 55) experienced respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath), 57% (27 of 47) had gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), and 76% (41 of 54) had constitutional symptoms (e.g. fever, chills, and weight loss) (Table 2). Very few patients reported only one symptom type (e.g. 9% [four of 47] reported having only respiratory symptoms). Initial oxygen saturation < 95% (while breathing room air) was reported among 30% (eight of 27) of patients and tachycardia among 40% (10 of 25); no patients had tachypnea. Twenty-one (81%) of 26 patients with available data were reportedly prescribed corticosteroids. Among 34 patients with results reported for initial chest radiographs (CXR), 28 (82%) had abnormal findings, and 76% (19 of 25) had bilateral findings; three cases had missing information and were excluded. All 28 patients with results reported for chest computed tomography (CT) scans had abnormal findings, including 27 (96%) with bilateral findings. Six of 16 (38%) patients with information on both a CXR and chest CT had an initial normal CXR but abnormal chest CT; 10 (63%) had both an abnormal CXR and chest CT.

Conclusions

The normal RNS in all seven patients who developed early respiratory failure suggests that the mechanism is muscarinic and/or central and not due to neuromuscular junction failure. This re-emphasizes the need for early rapid atropinisation. Further studies are needed to quantify CNS and muscarinic dysfunction to assist in the development of better treatments for the severe and early OP poisoning.

### Vaping-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome [^4e00bdc4]. Emergency Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Vaping-associated lung injury via the use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is currently being evaluated as a potential source of pulmonary injury with uncertain etiology as the use of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is increasing throughout the USA. ENDS are marketed to be unlike traditional cigarette smoking in that they are purported to contain only propylene glycol, vegetable glycerine, nicotine, and flavorants compared with the > 60 carcinogenic ingredients in cigarettes. The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) currently reports four imaging patterns correlated with vaping-attributed pathology including acute eosinophilic pneumonia, diffuse alveolar damage, organizing pneumonia, and lipoid pneumonia. The incidence and extent of lung disease in otherwise young healthy patients with a history of vaping has not however been definitively recognized within the field of radiology. We present a case of vaping-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a young patient with no additional past medical history. The immediate radiologic recognition of vaping as a risk factor for ARDS in the emergency setting is pivotal so that appropriate medical management and respiratory support can be initiated without delay.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with e-cigarette or vaping product use in bogot á, Colombia: a lung injury epidemic [^e20edc74]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The global use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and vaping devices has increased significantly since their introduction, particularly among adolescents and young adults. Promoted as safer alternatives to combustible cigarettes and potential tools for smoking cessation, these devices may deliver aerosolized mixtures of nicotine, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), flavoring agents, and other chemicals. However, emerging evidence has linked vaping to a range of adverse health outcomes, most notably a form of acute respiratory illness now known as e-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury (EVALI).

EVALI was first recognized during a 2019 outbreak in the United States, with patients typically presenting with non-specific respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest imaging, and recent vaping history. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines EVALI as a diagnosis of exclusion, requiring radiographic abnormalities, recent e-cigarette use within 90 days, and the absence of alternative diagnoses such as infectious or autoimmune etiologies.

Although the precise pathophysiological mechanisms underlying EVALI remain under investigation, proposed contributors include direct epithelial toxicity, oxidative stress, lipid-laden macrophage activation, and inflammatory responses triggered by substances such as vitamin E acetate, THC oils, and flavoring agents. Histopathologic findings in EVALI cases have included organizing pneumonia, diffuse alveolar damage, and eosinophilic pneumonitis. While most patients recover with corticosteroid therapy and supportive care, a substantial proportion require hospitalization or intensive care, particularly when diagnosis is delayed.

Most epidemiologic data on EVALI originates from North America and Europe, with limited case series reported in Latin America. However, recent data suggest that vaping prevalence is increasing in the region. According to the 2022 National Survey on Psychoactive Substance Use in Colombia, e-cigarettes are now the second most consumed psychoactive substance among school-aged children, with a lifetime prevalence of 22.7% and a mean initiation age of 14.1 years. In this context, isolated case reports have emerged from Colombian hospitals describing EVALI with systemic complications, including myocardial infarction and acute kidney injury.

This study aims to contribute to the growing international literature on EVALI by presenting a retrospective case series of 25 patients hospitalized with EVALI in a tertiary care hospital in Bogotá, Colombia. We describe the clinical, radiological, and histopathological features of these cases, highlighting the need for heightened clinical suspicion and public health awareness in low- and middle-income countries.

### Fatal intoxication with imidacloprid insecticide [^bd08765c]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Imidacloprid [1-(6-chloro-3-pyridylmethyl)-N-nitroimidazolidin-2-ylideneamine, CAS 138261-41-3] belongs to a relatively new class of insecticidal chemistry, the chloronicotinyl neonicotinoid compounds. Animal studies indicate relatively low toxicity to mammals. Despite wide usage in some countries, the understanding of human poisoning is quite limited. Here we report a fatal case of rapid ingestion of an insecticide formulation containing imidacloprid. Clinical manifestation included severe vomiting, hypertension, tachycardia, mydriasis with sluggish reaction to light, and loss of consciousness. In the course of toxicity, the patient manifested bradycardia, bradypnea, and cardiopulmonary arrest and death. Because moderate- to high-dose imidacloprid in animals causes central nervous system activation similar to nicotine, including tremors, impaired papillary function, and hypothermia, it is more likely that the formulation ingredients caused most of the clinical symptoms including central nervous system depression and gastrointestinal irritation.

### Outbreak of sudden death with acute encephalitis syndrome among children associated with exposure to lychee orchards in Northern Bangladesh, 2012 [^c4a27da2]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Fourth, the outbreak ended following the onset of the monsoon rains, which suggest that the toxin associated with the lychees was on their surface, rather than contained in the fruit. In India, a similar pattern was observed, where the number of cases peaked in mid-June and declined immediately after the onset of monsoon rains. Moreover, the findings of washing fruits and vegetables protective against lychee-associated illness in India further supports our assertion that toxin associated with the lychees may be on the surface.

Diagnosing unintentional pesticide or other agrochemical poisoning among children is difficult. The signs and symptoms of agrochemicals poisoning may vary by type of chemicals, route of exposures, and age of case-patients. In our study, most of the case-patients presented with reduced levels of consciousness or seizures rather than the classic nicotinic and muscarinic effects often seen in adults. This observation is consistent with previous findings of pesticide poisoning in young children, where the predominant manifestations were neurological. In addition, pesticide poisoning may imitate other severe disorders such as heat stroke, pneumonia, asthma, hypoglycemia, or intestinal secretions. Acute exposures to organophosphate and carbamate pesticides in children accumulate acetylcholine at the autonomic ganglia resulting in hypertension, pallor, and hypoglycemia. This could explain why most of the case-patients fall ill between 2and 8when blood glucose reaches to its lowest levels.

Confirming a diagnosis of toxic poisoning requires acute specimens and is aided by good clinical records. Since case-patients were admitted in serious condition and died quickly after arriving at the hospital, attending physicians did not collect acute specimens from patients during this outbreak, making a confirmed determination of the cause of death in these patients impossible. The clinical files for some case-patients were either missing or incomplete; so much of what we know about the clinical illness comes from interviews with the family caregivers. Case ascertainment was limited to admitted children at Dinajpur Medical College Hospital; therefore, we might have missed cases from villages whose residents might seek care in other facilities or who died before reaching the hospital. In addition, we missed adult cases who might have exposed to pesticide and developed mild symptoms but were not hospitalized as our case finding was limited to children with severe illness in the hospital. Moreover, lack of access to health facilities and cultural practices that favor health seeking from a traditional healer before consulting a trained physician limit the detection and reporting of AES cases in the affected areas.

### Effects on abstinence of nicotine patch treatment before quitting smoking: parallel, two arm, pragmatic randomised trial [^bcf9d014]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Adverse events

Adverse events were defined as newly occurring health conditions or exacerbations of existing conditions. We recorded adverse events that were either serious or of moderate or severe intensity between baseline and one week after quit day, covering the period of preloading and allowing one additional week for adverse events to emerge. Moderate or severe adverse events were defined as those that interfered somewhat or totally with normal functioning. Serious adverse events were defined as resulting in admission to hospital, death or life threatening events, permanent disability, or congenital abnormality. This excluded planned events, such as scheduled surgery. An independent committee assessed serious adverse events and adjudicated whether the event was unrelated, unlikely, possibly, probably, or definitely related to the use of nicotine patches. The committee members were blind to treatment allocation and hence also the temporal relation of drug use to the event.

We elicited adverse events from participants in both arms at contacts −3 weeks and at +1 week by asking about new or worsening health problems, followed by further inquiry as appropriate. These were coded using MedDRA v19.1. As it can be hard for trial staff and participants to understand the necessity to report adverse events for people in the control arm receiving no treatment, we also gave participants in both arms a questionnaire to complete about symptoms. This assessed symptoms of nicotine overdose in the previous 24 hours (such as nausea, excessive salivation) one week after baseline. Participants rated how troubled they had been by the symptoms in the past 24 hours on a scale from "not at all" to "very" or "extremely".

Based on data obtained in the investigation of EVALI since August 2019, CDC recommends that persons not use THC-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, products, particularly those from informal sources such as friends, family members, or from in-person or online dealers. †† Vitamin E acetate is strongly linked to the EVALI outbreak; it has been detected in product samples tested by FDA and state laboratories and in lung fluid samples from patients tested by CDC from geographically diverse states. Vitamin E acetate should not be added to any e-cigarette, or vaping, products. In addition, any substances not intended by the manufacturer should not be added to e-cigarette, or vaping, products, including to products purchased through retail establishments. However, evidence is not sufficient to rule out the contribution of other chemicals of concern, including chemicals in either THC- or non-THC–containing products, in some reported EVALI cases. Adults using e-cigarette, or vaping, products as an alternative to cigarettes should not go back to smoking; they should weigh all available information and consider using FDA-approved cessation medications. §§ They should contact their health care provider if they need help quitting tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, and if they have concerns about EVALI. Adults who do not currently use tobacco products should not start using e-cigarette, or vaping, products. Finally, e-cigarette, or vaping, products should never be used by youths, young adults, or pregnant women.

### Scopolamine [^d12eef8e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Anticholinergic toxicity includes, both central and peripheral signs and symptoms: agitation, central nervous system effects (e.g., coma, confusion, hallucinations, lethargy, seizures, somnolence), decreased bowel sounds, dry flushed skin, dry mouth, hyperthermia, hypertension supraventricular arrhythmias, tachycardia, urinary retention, visual disturbances (e.g., amblyopia, mydriasis). These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention.

In cases of toxicity remove the scopolamine transdermal system. Serious symptomatic cases of overdosage involving multiple transdermal system applications and/or ingestion may be managed by initially ensuring the patient has an adequate airway and supporting respiration and circulation. This should be rapidly followed by removal of all transdermal systems from the skin and the mouth. If there is evidence of transdermal system ingestion, endoscopic removal of swallowed transdermal systems or administration of activated charcoal should be considered, as indicated by the clinical situation. In any case where there is serious overdosage or signs of evolving acute toxicity, continuous monitoring of vital signs and ECG, establishment of intravenous access and administration of oxygen are all recommended.

The signs and symptoms of overdose/toxicity due to scopolamine should be carefully distinguished from the occasionally observed syndrome of withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Although mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both acute toxicity and withdrawal, other characteristic findings differ: tachyarrhythmias, dry skin and decreased bowel sounds suggest anticholinergic toxicity, while bradycardia, headache, nausea and abdominal cramps and sweating suggest post-removal withdrawal.

If over-exposure occurs, call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage.

Case Presentation

A 41-year-old man presented to our institution with shortness of breath for 1 day, and nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for 10 days. He has a medical history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, migraines, and anxiety. He is a 10 pack-year former cigarette smoker and an active vaper. He quit smoking cigarettes in 2013 but reports vaping flavored nicotine from 2013 to 2018. Since 2018, he has been vaping tetrahydrocannabinol products of different flavors and brands. A few weeks prior to admission, the subject had changed the brand of his vaping product to "Cookies High Flyers" with a "Biscotti" flavor. The new product contains 1,000 mg (883 mg tetrahydrocannabinol and 117 mg cannabidiol) in a 0.04 oz cartridge. He vapes five times a day, taking two to three puffs every time. He had recently traveled to Texas and had a sick contact with his 18-month-old daughter. She recently recovered from a diarrheal illness of presumed viral origin. Prior to admission, the subject tested negative for influenza and completed outpatient antibiotic treatment, with no improvement.

### The impact of cannabis legalization and decriminalization on acute poisoning: a systematic review [^d89b18fd]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

Increased prevalence of cannabis poisoning has been observed following legalization. Studies on poisoning typically use data from poisons centres. Poisons centre exposure calls can be triggered for a variety of reasons, including paediatric exposures (e.g. a child accessing edible marijuana products), a person experiencing signs/symptoms of toxicity following therapeutic or recreational use, dosing errors with medicinal marijuana and as an agent in deliberate self‐harm overdoses. Poisons centre coding of substances involved in exposures is typically extremely accurate, as it is coded by the poisons specialist handling the call. However, poisons centres underestimate the rates of exposures, as calls are voluntary. Other studies use hospital presentation or admission data, with reasons for presentation likely to be similar to reasons for calling a poisons centre. There are limitations in how well hospital data collects specific substances involved in poisonings, particularly with recreational drugs. A previous study identified a 34% increase in poison centre calls for cannabis exposure per year following legalization in Colorado. Similarly, emergency department presentations due to cannabis toxicity increased from 1.2 to 2.3 per 100 000 population after legalizing recreational cannabis.

We conducted a systematic review to investigate the effect of changing cannabis legalization and decriminalization on poisoning. Specifically, we aimed to evaluate the effect of the legalization of medicinal cannabis, and legalization or decriminalization of recreational cannabis, on acute poisoning with cannabis and cannabinoids.

### Butalbital, acetaminophen, caffeine and codeine phosphate [^ddfa296b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Clinical Presentation

Acute overdose with codeine can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Signs and Symptoms

Symptoms attributable to acute barbiturate poisoning include drowsiness, confusion, and coma; respiratory depression; hypotension; and hypovolemic shock.

Toxicity from codeine poisoning includes the opioid triad of: pinpoint pupils, depression of respiration, and loss of consciousness. Convulsions may occur.

In acetaminophen overdosage: dose dependent, potentially fatal hepatic necrosis is the most serious adverse effect. Renal tubular necrosis, hypoglycemic coma, and coagulation defects may also occur. Early symptoms following a potentially hepatotoxic overdose may include: nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, and general malaise. Clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatic toxicity may not be apparent until 48 to 72 hours post ingestion. Acute caffeine poisoning may cause insomnia, restlessness, tremor, and delirium, tachycardia, and extrasystoles.

### Death following intentional ingestion of e-liquid [^377d1141]. Clinical Toxicology (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is growing within the United States, resulting in both intentional and unintentional exposures to concentrated liquid nicotine or "e-liquid". Nicotine has been culpable for severe poisoning and deaths in the past. However, sources of nicotine have traditionally been from cigarettes, cigars, or pesticides. Fatalities due to liquid nicotine are rare, and fatalities following ingestion of e-liquid are even scarcer.

Case

We present a case of a 24-year-old woman who intentionally ingested up to 3000mg of liquid nicotine intended for e-cigarette use. She was found in pulseless electrical activity and had return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after undergoing approximately 10 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation with a blood pressure of 74/53mmHg and a pulse rate of 106 beats/min. Despite aggressive supportive care, she ultimately died after she was found to have multiple acute infarcts, consistent with severe anoxic brain injury, on magnetic resonance imaging. The patient's toxicologic testing, obtained shortly after ROSC, was notable for plasma nicotine and cotinine levels each > 1000ng/mL.

Discussion

This fatality highlights the potential toxicity associated with suicidal ingestion of liquid nicotine.

### Central nervous system toxicity [^2baffcd0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Central nervous system toxicity caused by xenobiotic exposure is a common reason for presentation to the emergency department. Sources of exposure may be medicinal, recreational, environmental, or occupational; the means of exposure may be intentional or unintended. Toxicity may manifest as altered thought content resulting in psychosis or confusion; may affect arousal, resulting in lethargy, stupor, or coma; or may affect both elements of consciousness. Seizures may also occur.

### Electronic nicotine delivery systems or E-cigarettes: American College of Preventive Medicine's practice statement [^baafa1a1]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) — comparative risks and adverse events synthesized across reviews indicate that a harms-focused review included 76 studies and most commonly reported lightheadedness, throat irritation, dizziness, and cough, concluding that inadequate information was available to draw firm conclusions; however, ENDS are certainly not harmless. A Cochrane review of 24 studies (three RCTs and 21 cohort studies) found no reported serious adverse events, with similar rates of minor adverse events between e-cigarette users and placebo, and noted that the long-term safety is unknown. A review of five controlled clinical trials found no difference versus controls (NRT or placebo) on multiple non-serious adverse outcomes, though only two studies adequately reported adverse effects and only one reported serious adverse events; serious adverse events were higher in ENDS (19.7%) than in the non-nicotine device group (13.9%) and patches (11.8%), but "no serious adverse events in any group were related to product use". A subsequent review including 12 studies (three RCTs and nine cohort studies) found that in all studies except one there was no reported difference in serious side effects when comparing groups using ENDS versus placebo ENDS, and no studies were found examining harms in pregnant women. Case reports summarized 26 case reports of 27 individuals across systemic health effects (13), nicotine poisoning (12), and mechanical injury (two); additionally, between 2012 and 2015 there were 92 incidents of overheating, fire, and explosions that injured 47 people and caused property damage in 67 cases.

### Acute multiple organ failure with imidacloprid and alcohol ingestion [^88651302]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Imidacloprid [1-(6-chloro-3-pyridylmethyl)-N-nitroimidazolidin-2-ylideneamine] belongs to a relatively new class of insecticidal chemistry, the chloronicotinyl neonicotinoid compounds. Animal studies indicate relatively low toxicity to mammals due to nicotinic receptor resistance. Human poisoning is usually mild, and reports are quite limited. Here, we report a case of ingestion of alcohol with an insecticide containing imidacloprid. Clinical manifestation included mild disorientation, followed by bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmia, and cardiopulmonary arrest. Acute multiple organ failure, including oliguric kidney injury, acute lung injury, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis developed within hours of ingestion. Renal replacement therapy, including intermittent hemodialysis and continuous venovenous hemodialysis, quickly corrected the metabolic acidosis with better blood pressure. Despite original belief that imidacloprid has low mammalian toxicity, there is increasing evidence that imidacloprid may cause heart, kidney, and other organ damages and even death besides gastrointestinal irritation and neurological symptoms. The role of aldehyde oxidase, imidacloprid metabolites, and ethanol alcohol consumption in the pathogenesis of imidacloprid toxicity needs further study.

Poisoning/overdose universal care — assessment, documentation, and performance: Frequent reassessment is essential as patient deterioration can be rapid and catastrophic. Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) include eProtocol.01 with 9914135 — General - Overdose/Poisoning/Toxic Ingestion. Key documentation elements include repeat evaluation and documentation of signs and symptoms as patient clinical conditions may deteriorate rapidly, identification of possible etiology of poisoning, initiating measures on scene to prevent exposure of bystanders when appropriate/indicated, and recording time of symptoms onset and time of initiation of exposure-specific treatments. Performance measures emphasize early airway management in the rapidly deteriorating patient, accurate exposure history, appropriate protocol selection and management, and multiple frequent documented reassessments.

### Revisited: therapeutic and toxic blood concentrations of more than 1100 drugs and other xenobiotics [^fe227eaa]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In case of acute or chronic intoxications, the concentration of the ingested substance and/or metabolite in blood much better predicts the clinical severity of the case when compared to the assumed amount and time of ingestion. Comparing and contrasting the clinical case against the data provided, including the half-life, may support the decision for or against further intensive care. In addition, the data provided are useful for the therapeutic monitoring of pharmacotherapies, to facilitate the diagnostic assessment and monitoring of acute and chronic intoxications as well as to support forensic and clinical expert opinions.

### Sustained release bupropion overdose: an important cause of prolonged symptoms after an overdose [^6ebf45c1]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

The case is reported of a patient who had taken a deliberate overdose of sustained release bupropion. The patient suffered from prolonged symptoms including seizures before fully recovering. The prescription of bupropion is encouraged as an aid to smoking cessation and it is probable that bupropion overdose will become more common. Emergency departments need to be aware that patients taking an overdose of sustained release bupropion may have a delayed onset and prolonged course of symptoms. The pharmacology, clinical features, and treatment of bupropion overdose are discussed.

### Clinical practice guideline: assessment and treatment of adolescents and young adults with substance use disorders and problematic substance use (excluding tobacco) [^96ab401a]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Medical evaluation and comorbidities — alcohol-related medical problems describe that acute intoxication impairs memory, decision making, and coordination and increases risks such as motor vehicle accidents; at high doses, amnesic episodes (blackouts), stupor, coma, and death from respiratory depression can occur, and alcohol suppresses rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and causes sleep fragmentation. Withdrawal symptoms from alcohol can occur between about 8 hours and 7 days of cessation after regular use and last between 5 days and several weeks, with manifestations including hand tremors, insomnia, increased anxiety, vital sign abnormalities, gastrointestinal upset, hallucinations, and seizures; delirium tremens is not usually seen in adolescents or young adults. Any amount of alcohol can be harmful to a human fetus, and about 10% of all births in Western countries are estimated to exhibit alcohol-induced deficits collectively known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, including fetal alcohol syndrome.

### Unintentional pediatric ingestion of electronic Cigarette nicotine refill liquid necessitating intubation [^d19a0d82]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Liquid nicotine used in electronic cigarette devices is highly concentrated, unreliably packaged, and poorly regulated. We present a case report of a 6-year-old female who developed severe toxicity and required intubation after an unintentional oral ingestion of approximately 703 mg (35 mg/kg) of liquid nicotine, with accompanying serum and urine concentrations of nicotine and its metabolites. Analysis of the ingested liquid suggests a nicotine concentration of 140.6 mg/mL in the purchased commercial product, or 234% of its labeled concentration. Clinicians should be aware of these products and the potential severity of toxicity they may incur.

### Challenges in the diagnosis of acute cyanide poisoning [^db84040e]. Clinical Toxicology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this systematic review was to identify isolated acute cyanide poison cases and to identify reported signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Reviews, and Web of Science case reports and series using a number of MeSH descriptors pertaining to cyanide, toxicity, and poisonings. We excluded studies on plants, laboratory analyses, smoke inhalation poisonings, animals as well as non-English language articles and those in which data were not available. Data extracted included demographics, exposure characteristics, acute signs/symptoms, and medical management and outcome.

Results

From the initial 2976 articles retrieved, 65 articles (52 case reports, 13 case series) met inclusion criteria and described 102 patients. Most patients were unresponsive (78%), hypotensive (54%), or had respiratory failure (73%); other signs and symptoms included cardiac arrest (20%), seizures (20%), cyanosis (15%), cherry red skin (11%), and had an odor present (15%). Medical management included cyanide antidote kit (20%), sodium thiosulfate (40%), and hydroxocobalamin (29%). The majority of cases (66%) required intubation with mechanical ventilation and a substantial number (39%) developed refractory hypotension requiring vasopressor support.

Conclusions

Contrary to general reviews published on cyanide toxicity, reports of cherry red skin and bitter almond odor were rare among published cyanide cases. Consistent with other studies, metabolic acidosis with significant lactic acidosis were the laboratory values consistently associated with cyanide toxicity. Healthcare providers may overlook cyanide toxicity in the differential diagnosis, if certain expected characteristics, such as the odor of almonds or a cherry red color of the skin are absent on physical examination.

### Effectiveness and safety of nicotine replacement therapy assisted reduction to stop smoking: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1df6729e]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Adverse events

Overall, 1384 predominantly middle aged smokers were treated with nicotine replacement therapy for six to 18 months and 1383 were treated with placebo. Four deaths occurred in those randomised to nicotine replacement therapy and four in those randomised to placebo: odds ratio 1.00 (95% confidence interval 0.25 to 4.02; fig 3). Serious adverse events occurred in fewer than 8% of participants in both arms: 1.09 (0.79 to 1.50; fig 3). In no cases were these judged likely to have been due to treatment. Discontinuation of treatment because of adverse events was rare, with 1.7% in the nicotine replacement therapy group and 1.3% in the placebo group: odds ratio 1.27 (0.64 to 2.51; fig 3). Nausea was selected as an index symptom to indicate possible nicotine overdose. It was slightly and significantly more common in the nicotine replacement therapy group, with 8.6% experiencing nausea compared with 5.3% in the placebo group: 1.69 (1.21 to 2.36; fig 3).

Fig 3 Meta-analysis of safety outcomes; pooled estimates are Peto's odds ratio (fixed effects). Heterogeneity statistic Q for death was 4.04 (P = 0.257), for serious adverse events was 11.19 (P = 0.048), for discontinuation of treatment because of adverse events was 1.70 (P 0.636), and for nausea was 2.36 (P = 0.797). I² was 0 (negative value [100×[(Q−DF)/Q)] except for serious adverse events, where I² was 55%

### Recommendations for the appropriate structure, communication, and investigation of tobacco harm reduction claims. An official American Thoracic Society policy statement [^20e3dc82]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Nicotine dependence considerations in harm reduction — new nicotine dependence is not just the antecedent to illness but a manifestation of altered brain biology, and regardless of extra–central nervous system effects the potential for causing or sustaining addiction should be accurately represented in risk trade-off calculations; nicotine causes dependence through its action on nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the mesolimbic centers of the brain, nicotine addiction manifests as a compulsive disorder with withdrawal causing significant depressed mood, insomnia, frustration, anxiety, and agitation comparable to that caused by opiates, amphetamines, and cocaine, and relapse often follows prolonged periods of abstinence.
