## Question

Next step after findings of liver scalloping?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the next step should be after findings of "liver scalloping" on imaging. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the imaging finding and excluding mimics. Then, I should verify the most likely etiology, which is pseudomyxoma peritonei, and consider differentials. Next, I will review the prognostic implications of scalloping and mucin thickness. After that, I need to outline immediate diagnostic workup, including targeted imaging and tumor markers. Then, I should address staging and surgical planning with validated tools. Finally, I will consider management pathways, including CRS/HIPEC, systemic therapy, and surveillance, and close with documentation and communication steps.

> Let me first confirm the imaging finding and not jump to conclusions; "liver scalloping" refers to concave indentations of the hepatic capsule caused by mass-effect from gelatinous mucinous ascites and peritoneal implants, classically seen in pseudomyxoma peritonei, and I should double-check that this is not capsular retraction from prior ablation or cirrhosis-related surface nodularity before proceeding further [^116twDkC] [^113bDy3c] [^117DL9BR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check for the full PMP phenotype on contrast-enhanced CT, including voluminous, loculated, low-attenuation mucinous ascites, omental cake, mesenteric distortion, and especially scalloping of visceral surfaces of liver and spleen, while also scrutinizing the appendix for a primary appendiceal mucinous neoplasm and looking for calcifications within mucin, which together strengthen the diagnosis of PMP and help distinguish it from simple ascites or other peritoneal processes [^116twDkC] [^113Q1z2q] [^116neXum].

> Wait, let me verify the prognostic weight of scalloping; the presence of liver scalloping independently predicts significantly shorter disease-free survival after complete cytoreduction, with a hazard ratio around 4.3, and thicker mucin deposition at the liver surface, particularly ≥ 20 mm, correlates with worse outcomes, so I should document the maximal mucin thickness and explicitly note scalloping in the report because it will influence surgical planning and counseling [^112um4m4].

> I should confirm the immediate diagnostic workup; next, I will obtain a contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis if not already available, add a chest CT to complete staging, and order CEA, CA 19–9, and CA-125, while also reviewing the appendix, ovaries, colon, and pancreas for a primary source, because identifying the origin and extent of disease guides resectability and oncologic strategy [^116twDkC] [^115KCGxV] [^113Q1z2q].

> Let me consider MRI when CT is indeterminate or to refine soft-tissue and perihepatic disease; MRI offers superior contrast for gelatinous implants, which are T2 hyperintense, and can help delineate perihepatic metastases and subtle peritoneal implants that CT might miss, so I should request MRI if surgical planning would benefit from better mapping of mucinous deposits or if CT is equivocal [^116twDkC] [^117RHDTU].

> Next, I should review staging and surgical planning; I will calculate a peritoneal carcinomatosis index using CT or combined US-CT approaches, and apply the SPAAT score, where scalloping of liver, spleen, pancreas, or portal vein each adds a point and mesenteric foreshortening adds three points, because higher SPAAT correlates with reduced likelihood of complete cytoreduction and informs operative complexity and candidacy for CRS/HIPEC [^115KCGxV] [^114F9WU7].

> I need to ensure multidisciplinary coordination; urgent referral to a high-volume peritoneal malignancy center for surgical oncology and medical oncology evaluation is essential, with gynecologic oncology input if ovarian involvement is suspected, because outcomes in PMP are center- and surgeon-volume dependent and early CRS/HIPEC offers the best chance of long-term disease control in appropriate candidates [^112um4m4] [^112skAHk].

> But wait, what if complete cytoreduction is not feasible; in unresectable or high-burden disease, I should consider systemic therapy such as mitomycin C plus capecitabine within a clinical trial framework or at experienced centers, recognizing that response assessment is challenging and that RECIST is poorly applicable due to mucinous volume dynamics, so radiologic scoring that captures compressive effects and mucin distribution is prudent [^112skAHk] [^115nRAft].

> I should double-check the surveillance plan after treatment; for low-grade PMP, annual CT of the abdomen and pelvis for at least 6 years with chest imaging as indicated is reasonable, with earlier intervals or MRI considered in high-grade disease or when recurrence is suspected, and I must remember that small-bowel infiltration can be missed if both peritoneum and omentum have been resected, so vigilance for new scalloping or mesenteric changes remains important [^116twDkC].

> Let me reconsider the differential briefly to avoid anchoring; while PMP is the leading cause of true visceral scalloping, peritoneal carcinomatosis from other primaries can produce plaque-like implants that indent capsular surfaces and mimic scalloping, and capsular retraction from prior ablation or cirrhosis can be confused with scalloping, so correlating with mucinous ascites, primary site, and pattern of disease helps prevent misclassification [^112WZNv6] [^113bDy3c] [^117DL9BR].

> Finally, I need to ensure meticulous documentation and communication; I will explicitly report the presence and maximal thickness of liver scalloping, quantify mucinous ascites distribution, note omental cake and mesenteric foreshortening, record CEA/CA 19–9/CA-125 values, and communicate the prognostic implications to the treating team, because scalloping is an independent predictor of recurrence and should be highlighted in the radiology impression to guide urgency and extent of surgical management [^112um4m4] [^116twDkC].

---

The next step after identifying liver scalloping is to **confirm the diagnosis and assess disease extent** with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI [^116twDkC] to characterize mucinous ascites, identify the primary site (usually appendiceal) [^113bDy3c], and stage peritoneal disease [^115KCGxV]. Then, **refer urgently to a peritoneal malignancy center** for multidisciplinary evaluation and cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC, as scalloping indicates advanced PMP and worse recurrence risk [^112um4m4]. Also obtain baseline tumor markers (CEA, CA-19–9, CA-125) and consider image-guided biopsy if the primary is unclear [^114dKge5].

---

## Confirmatory imaging and diagnostic evaluation

- **Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI**: Obtain multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT or MRI to confirm mucinous ascites, map peritoneal disease, and identify the primary site (commonly appendiceal) [^116twDkC] [^113Q1z2q].

- **Primary tumor identification**: Look for an appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (dilated appendix with hypodense material, septa, thin walls, peripheral calcifications) or other primaries (colon, ovary, pancreas, urachus) [^113Q1z2q].

- **Peritoneal disease assessment**: Document omental cake, mesenteric involvement, and small-bowel tethering to guide surgical planning [^114F9WU7].

- **Tumor markers**: Obtain CEA, CA-19–9, and CA-125 as baseline for monitoring and prognostication [^notfound].

---

## Multidisciplinary team (MDT) referral

Refer urgently to a specialized peritoneal malignancy center for **MDT evaluation**, including surgical oncology, medical oncology, radiology, and pathology. Then determine **surgical candidacy** for cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), the standard curative approach [^114F9WU7].

---

## Additional diagnostic considerations

If the primary site remains unclear, consider **image-guided biopsy** of peritoneal or omental lesions for histopathology [^116twDkC]. Also perform a **comprehensive preoperative assessment** — including cardiopulmonary evaluation and nutritional status — to optimize surgical outcomes.

---

## Clinical implications of liver scalloping

Liver scalloping reflects **advanced PMP** with extensive mucinous ascites and peritoneal involvement [^116twDkC]. Its presence independently predicts higher recurrence and shorter disease-free survival after CRS/HIPEC [^112um4m4]. Thicker mucin deposition (≥ 20 mm) further increases recurrence risk [^112um4m4].

---

## Summary of recommended next steps

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI to confirm diagnosis and stage disease [^115KCGxV] |
| 2 | Identify primary tumor site (appendix, colon, ovary, pancreas, urachus) [^113bDy3c] |
| 3 | Obtain baseline tumor markers (CEA, CA-19–9, CA-125) [^notfound] |
| 4 | Urgent referral to peritoneal malignancy center for MDT evaluation [^112skAHk] |
| 5 | Assess surgical candidacy for CRS/HIPEC [^114F9WU7] |
| 6 | Consider image-guided biopsy if primary site unclear [^notfound] |

---

The next step after liver scalloping is to **confirm PMP with contrast-enhanced CT/MRI**, identify the primary, and refer urgently for CRS/HIPEC at a specialized center, as scalloping signals advanced disease and higher recurrence risk [^112um4m4].

RADIOGRAPHIC DETECTION

Discerning obscure features of PMP at an early stage is of great significance, which determines survival time and quality. Mucinous neoplasm is perceived when high attenuation peritoneal thickening or masses breaking natural anatomy is shown on computed tomography (CT) images. Typically, visceral scalloping, especially liver scalloping suggests mucinous ascites caused by PMP when a subphrenic implant is excluded. Some came up with hypotheses that the imaging of liver scalloping was relevant to the accumulation of mucin deposition and predicted a high risk of recurrence after CRS. When radiologists detect peritoneal nodules, visceral compression and mucinous low density ascites in compartment (Fig. 1), PMP should be taken into account. Although regular CT has been chosen as the preferred technique in the follow-up, omitting recurrence could happen when both peritoneum and omentum resections have been done and tumor infiltration comes along the small bowel. It is appropriate for low-grade PMP patients to get annual CT scan of abdomen and pelvis in the first 6 years, chest examination and the frequency should be added if meets high-grade lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging owns particular advantages in high sensitivity of the assessment of PMP, as gelatinous implants that consist of plenty of water molecules show high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. It is deemed a normal phenomenon if peritoneal enhancement is equivalent to muscle enhancement. Magnetic resonance imaging provides tough evidence of metastasis in the liver and perihepatic region for its favorable soft tissue contrast which is related to poor prognosis.

### Pseudomyxoma peritonei: visceral scalloping on CT is a predictor of recurrence after complete cytoreductive surgery [^112um4m4]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is characterized by peritoneal dissemination of gelatinous ascites following rupture of a mucinous tumor. Treatment by cytoreductive surgery (CRS) has improved its prognosis. Although visceral scalloping, notably liver scalloping, on computed tomography (CT) is a typical feature of PMP, its prognostic value remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of liver scalloping in predicting recurrence in PMP patients.

Methods

Among 159 consecutive patients with PMP who had contrast-enhanced CT between September 2012 and December 2018, 64 treatment-naïve patients who subsequently underwent CRS with complete resection (i.e., completeness of cytoreduction score (CC)-0 or CC-1), were included in analysis. Presence of liver scalloping and maximum thickness of mucin deposition at the liver surface were evaluated on CT. Disease-free survival (DFS) was determined based on the combination of postoperative CT features and tumor marker values.

Results

Median follow-up was 24.3 months. CT revealed liver scalloping in 40/64 (63.4%) patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significantly shorter DFS in patients with scalloping than in those without (p = 0.001; hazard ratio, 4.3). In patients with scalloping, greater mucin deposition (thickness ≥ 20 mm) significantly correlated with poorer DFS (p = 0.042). In multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression including CC status, pathologic type, and tumor markers, the presence of scalloping independently and significantly correlated with DFS (p = 0.031).

Conclusions

Liver scalloping was an independent predictor even after adjusting for clinical covariates. The presence of liver scalloping can lead to a high recurrence rate after CRS.

Key Points

- The presence of liver scalloping is a prognostic factor independent of histological grade and tumor markers.
- Greater mucin deposition (thickness ≥ 20 mm at the liver surface) is associated with higher recurrence rates in patients with liver scalloping.

### Acute liver failure guidelines [^113hHp6g]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

General management — initial assessment and diagnostic evaluation — Initial assessment should focus on distinguishing between acute and chronic or acute-on-chronic liver failure, with extensive laboratory and imaging tests helping in that differentiation; obtaining a complete history is of utmost importance, including prescription and over-the-counter medications, complementary and alternative medications, and controlled substance monitoring databases, and all attempts should be made to contact next of kin if history is unobtainable; patients with acute liver failure should be referred for consultation by hepatology or gastroenterology as soon as possible after identification, prognostic assessment and decision related to transfer and liver transplant (LT) should be made as early as possible, and early referral to a liver transplant center is essential because transfer may take time and patients may deteriorate quickly; physical examination should focus on vital signs, presence of jaundice, signs of chronic liver disease, and careful mental status, and encephalopathy due to hepatic encephalopathy can be graded according to the West-Haven Criteria.

### A simplified preoperative assessment predicts complete cytoreduction and outcomes in patients with low-grade mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix [^114F9WU7]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Derivation of Simplified Preoperative Assessment for Appendix Tumor (SPAAT) Score

We developed a set of imaging criteria to predict complete cytoreduction based on preoperative CT Scans in patients with low-grade mucinous adenocarcinoma (LGMA) of the appendix treated at our institution (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA). Five anatomic locations were assessed and graded to reflect the volume and nature of the disease. The presence of scalloping was considered to be the important imaging feature; this feature is identified by the indentation of the organ by mucinous ascites. One point each was given to the presence of scalloping on the liver, spleen, pancreas, or portal vein (Fig. 1). Additionally, 0 or 3 points were assigned to the absence or presence of mesenteric foreshortening of the small bowel. In the presence of mucinous ascites, the small bowel appears to float to the abdominal wall in the absence of mesenteric foreshortening (Fig. 2 a). Once the small bowel mesentery becomes involved with tumor, the mesentery foreshortens, causing the small bowel to appear tethered and cocoon-like on CT (Fig. 2 b), a term known as 'cauliflowering' of the small bowel. This score was assigned as either a 0 or 3. The SPAAT scoring system allowed for scores ranging from 0 to 7. All CT scans were obtained with intravenous contrast.

Fig. 1
SPAAT scoring of visceral organs. a Mucinous ascites around the liver and spleen; however, the border is smooth without evidence of scalloping and this would be assigned zero points. b Mucinous ascites with a smooth spleen and pancreas border. Again, zero points are assigned. c CT scan findings of scalloping of the liver (arrow). d Liver and spleen scalloping (arrows). e Loss of the smooth pancreatic border with indentation of the organ (arrow), representing a CT finding that would score one point. SPAAT simplified preoperative assessment for appendix tumor, CT computed tomography

Fig. 2

This would be assigned a zero for the SPAAT score. However, in panel b the patient demonstrates tethering of the small bowel, and would be given 3 points in the SPAAT system. SPAAT simplified preoperative assessment for appendix tumor

Step 2 — conduct standard history and blood tests to obtain key measures states, "We recommend that all at-risk patients identified in Step 1 be screened for alcohol use and have liver tests (or comprehensive metabolic panel, if done as part of routine care) and a complete blood count as part of the initial screening process". It further notes, "The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that all adults 18 years and older be screened for alcohol use disorders, using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise, or single-question screening tool". Results from standard laboratory tests "can allow clinicians to calculate simple fibrosis scores such as Fibrosis-4 [FIB-4] or NAFLD Fibrosis Score" and can "identify patients with elevated aminotransferases", who "should be evaluated for presence of other chronic liver and biliary diseases, including chronic hepatitis C virus infection, chronic hepatitis B virus infection, alcohol-related liver disease, and mass lesions (via liver imaging)".

### Care of the patient with abnormal liver test results [^1155Yms9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Liver tests are commonly performed in primary care and may signal the presence of acute or chronic liver disease. Abnormal results are defined by standardized rather than individual laboratory thresholds and must be interpreted in the context of a patient's history and examination. The pattern and severity of liver injury may provide clues about the cause of disease and should guide diagnostic evaluation with serologic testing and liver imaging. A systematic, stepwise approach to the evaluation and management of abnormal liver test results is recommended to optimize high-value care.

### CT and MR in peritoneal malignancies: pearls and pitfalls at preoperative examination [^117RHDTU]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

PM in the upper abdomen

The upper abdomen in peritoneal diseases is known as the supramesocolic compartment, the peritoneal space above the root of the transverse mesocolon, containing intraperitoneal organs such as the liver, spleen, and stomach. The ligaments are essential to support and connect the abdominal organs. These can divide the supramesocolic space into several subspaces, including right and left subphrenic spaces and a subhepatic space that continues into the lesser sac. The lesser and greater omentum can be included in this region; the former is stretched from the lesser curvature of the stomach to the left hepatic lobe, and the latter is a fatty membrane originating from the transverse colon and covering the entire small bowel. In the upper abdomen, the hepatic and splenic surfaces are the two most frequent sites of peritoneal implants, as well as the greater omentum. These usually indent the parenchyma, resulting in a typically "scalloping" appearance of the underlying parenchyma.

### Causes of hepatic capsular retraction: a pictorial essay [^113bDy3c]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Treated tumours

Minimally invasive ablation techniques have increasingly important roles in the management of hepatic tumours, particularly in patients who are unfit for surgery. Multiple ablation techniques have been employed in the treatment of liver tumours, including radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), ethanol injections and microwave ablation (MWA). These ablative techniques result in coagulative necrosis of the tumour tissue, which eventually involutes and is replaced by fibrous scar tissue, which in turn can result in hepatic capsular retraction (Figs. 20 and 21).

Fig. 21
Hypo-enhancing focus with capsular retraction in segment 2, at a site of radiofrequency ablation performed for hepatocellular carcinoma 12 months earlier

Pseudomyxoma peritonei

Pseudomyxoma peritonei is the diffuse accumulation of gelatinous ascites due to the rupture of well-differentiated mucinous tumours. The most common cause is ruptured mucinous tumour of the appendix. Mucinous tumours of the colon, rectum and pancreas and urachal tumours have also been shown to cause pseudomyxoma peritonei. There is some controversy regarding pseudomyxoma peritonei due to rupture of tumours of the ovary, and whether these are in fact appendiceal tumour metastases rather than primary ovarian tumours. On CT, pseudomyxoma peritonei appears as low-attenuation, often loculated fluid throughout the peritoneum, omentum and mesentery. Scalloping of visceral surfaces, particularly in the liver, with distortion of the capsule is a very typical feature and allows differentiation from simple ascites. This capsular distortion may mimic hepatic capsular retraction on imaging (Fig. 22). Curvilinear calcification may also be present. On MRI, the gelatinous ascites typically demonstrates low signal on T1 and high signal on T2, and may show some enhancement post-administration of gadolinium contrast.

Wilson disease (WD) dietary management — adults and adolescents: A moderately copper-restricted diet complements medical therapy, and registered dietitians (RDs) can facilitate implementation of a workable and effective personalized dietary plan. Patients with WD should try to keep intake of copper to the RDA, < 0.9 mg/day, avoid foods with very high concentrations of copper and most nondairy milk alternatives, and note that among shellfish, scallops are quite low in copper and vegetable-derived "meat" products are also high in copper. During the maintenance phase of disease management, individuals should continue to be mindful of copper intake, with emphasis on low-copper (< 0.08 mg copper/serving) and moderate-copper (0.08–0.2 mg copper/serving) foods making up the base of their diet, with serving size considered and no specific limitation per day recommended.

Materials and methods

Study population and follow-up

The Aerospace Center Hospital Ethics Committee approved the retrospective study. We performed it in accordance with the Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.

We collected data from all the patients scheduled for CRS treatment in our hospital between April 2008 and Dec 2018. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) all patients with a confirmed PMP diagnosis; (2) patients who underwent both US and CT examination 1–2 weeks before surgery; (3) patients with available S-PCI and pathological results. The exclusion criteria were patients with exploratory laparotomy only. We also collected age, gender, and primary tumor site data.

The current PMP classification consensus divides patients into three categories: "low-grade", "high-grade", and "with signet ring cells". Here, we used two categories, low-grade and high-grade, and included patients "with signet ring cells" in the latter. Follow-up abdomen CT scans every 6 months for the first 5 years, then once a year in the following years were advised. All patients provided informed consent.

Preoperative imaging and US-CT PCI evaluation

We performed preoperative CT scans and US examinations using a Light Speed VCT apparatus and an Aixplorer Ultrasound diagnostic System, respectively. We conducted bowel preparation instead of enteroclysis. Patients had to fast for 8 h before the examination. The patients received 500 mL of 3% meglumine diatrizoate orally at 9 pm on the previous day, 2 h before the exam, and 10 min before the exam. The CT scan was performed from the top of the diaphragm to the plane of the symphysis pubis in the supine position. We first conducted the CT plain film scanning with a tube voltage of 120 kV, tube current of 250 mA, and reconstruction layer thickness and interval of 0.625 mm. Next, we performed enhanced CT scanning after intravenous injection with non-ionic contrast media (iopromide). Two senior specialists independently examined all the US and CT images and reported the classical features of liver scalloping, ascites, abdominal lymph nodes, omental cake, mesenteric involvement, hepatic hilum involvement, small omentum involvement, and abdominal mass.

Further risk stratification in the gastroenterology and hepatology practice settings — advanced tools and biopsy use are described: The primary goal in the specialty care setting is the identification of patients with "at-risk" NASH or advanced fibrosis who may benefit from targeted interventions; MR-based tools such as MRE or MRI corrected T1 (cT1) can be used to further risk stratify when other noninvasive tests are indeterminate or not reflective of clinical suspicion, and liver biopsy should be considered when there is diagnostic uncertainty or when there is persistent elevation (> 6 mo) in liver chemistries.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^111fc4w9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Incidental focal liver lesions (FLLs) — initial evaluation and management: Incidental liver lesions can be defined as suspected findings within the liver, which are often identified on outpatient or emergency department imaging performed to investigate an unrelated clinical symptom such as pain, weight loss, or trauma, and imaging studies performed under these circumstances are usually either an abdominal ultrasound or contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen, and while they may identify a FLL, they cannot adequately characterize the lesion itself. Given the extensive categories of benign and malignant pathologies of FLLs, as well as differences in management, liver-directed imaging is often needed for adequate clarification; however, there are a few instances where further workup of incidental FLLs is not necessary, specifically if the imaging appearance on abdominal ultrasound or single-phase CT is characteristic for a hemangioma or benign uncomplicated cyst. In most instances, characterization of liver lesions requires careful investigation of the medical history, clinical symptomatology, physical examination, laboratory workup, and imaging, with attention to histories that suggest increased risk such as previous cancer, constitutional symptoms, foreign travel, medications including oral contraceptive pills, hormone supplementation, or steroids, and risk factors for chronic liver disease. Detection is common, with some studies showing that up to 52% of patients without cancer have a benign liver lesion at autopsy and the American College of Radiology reporting that up to 15% of patients have an incidental liver lesion detected on routine noninvasive imaging; common modalities detecting incidental lesions include ultrasonography (US) with or without contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

### A phase II study evaluating the use of concurrent mitomycin C and capecitabine in patients with advanced unresectable pseudomyxoma peritonei [^112skAHk]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

In an effort to overcome these potential limitations, CT assessment of treatment was approached systematically using three criteria: (i) overall assessment of the disease volume including mucin (supported by measurement of discrete deposits where possible); (ii) recording of new disease sites and (iii) the extent of compressive effects of disease on intraperitoneal organs, for example, degree of scalloping of the liver and spleen, compression of the stomach and strictures of the small or large bowel. Decreases in volumes of mucin alone were not recorded as responses.

The present study has a number of advantages. First, data on treatment responses, survival, toxicity and quality of life were collected prospectively. Second, uniform criteria were used to report histological classifications and radiological responses. Third, the study was set within the framework of a dedicated Peritoneal Tumour Multidisciplinary meeting, which assesses resectability and directs patients along appropriate clinical pathways. This achievement was brought about through the establishment of two centralised national treatment services – Christie Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (Manchester, UK) and North Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (Basingstoke, UK) –commissioned by the UK National Health Service (NHS) National Commissioning Group for Highly Specialised Services. This funding system circumnavigates many logistic problems of undertaking a trial in a rare tumour.

### Gallbladder scalloping, mammillated caudate lobe, and inferior vena cava scalloping: three novel ultrasound signs of cirrhosis [^117DL9BR]. Academic Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

We aimed to present three new ultrasound signs-gallbladder scalloping, mammillated caudate lobe, and inferior vena cava scalloping-and determine their accuracy in diagnosing liver cirrhosis.

Materials and Methods

A total of 201 consecutive patients with a history of chronic liver disease who had undergone ultrasound imaging and liver biopsy were identified. A senior ultrasound radiologist blindly reviewed the ultrasound examinations. Specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of diagnosing cirrhosis were calculated for all evaluated ultrasound signs and selected combinations of signs, using the liver biopsy results as the reference standard.

Results

Of the 201 patients, 152 (76%) had either pathology-proven cirrhosis or significant fibrosis. Caudate lobe hypertrophy was the most specific (88%) and most positive predictor (90%) for cirrhosis, whereas mammillated caudate lobe was the most sensitive (78%). Inferior vena cava scalloping was the most specific (78%) of the three proposed ultrasound signs. When signs were combined, the presence of either gallbladder scalloping or liver surface nodularity was highly sensitive for cirrhosis (87%), whereas the presence of either gallbladder scalloping or inferior vena cava scalloping with caudate lobe hypertrophy was highly specific (93%).

Conclusions

Gallbladder scalloping, mammillated caudate lobe, and inferior vena cava scalloping are three novel signs that improve the accuracy of ultrasound in diagnosing cirrhosis.

ACG Clinical Guideline: Hepatic hemangioma — Ultrasound criteria and subsequent steps — Small echogenic avascular lesions less than 2 cm with well-defined borders in a patient with a normal liver and no underlying medical history or risk factors for liver disease or malignancy can be diagnosed as hemangioma on ultrasound. In patients with a lesion that does not meet the above criteria, multiphasic contrast-enhanced imaging should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. If a suspected hemangioma cannot be confirmed on cross-sectional imaging, then the next step is to monitor and to review the case at a multidisciplinary tumor board.

Trainees should be able to establish and implement an evaluation plan that may include laboratory and imaging studies, liver biopsy, and endoscopic procedures; understand indications, risks, and procedures for performing percutaneous liver biopsy; be competent to perform endoscopic procedures and identify pertinent findings; and assemble available data to establish a problem list and assign a diagnosis/diagnoses or define next steps. Trainees should develop a management plan considering specific therapy if available (immunosuppression for autoimmune hepatitis) or general management (optimize nutrition, manage ascites and encephalopathy); include primary and related or unrelated problems (for example anemia, malnutrition, ascites, pruritus, psychosocial concerns); consider the natural history; and understand key disorders including biliary atresia, acute liver failure, acute severe Wilson disease, and metabolic liver disease such as defects of urea cycle metabolism.

Identification of people with NAFLD

Use of defined pathways for the investigation of suspected liver disease has been shown to increase the diagnosis of significant liver disease and reduce unnecessary referrals. Therefore, services should have an agreed local clinical pathway for the investigation of suspected liver disease that includes an assessment for liver fibrosis using available non-invasive liver fibrosis tests (Recommendation 1, Table 1). Key aspects to consider when developing pathways are described below.

NAFLD is considered the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome (defined as any three of the following: impaired fasting glucose or T2DM; hypertriglyceridemia; low HDL; increased waist circumference or high blood pressure). As well as NAFLD being highly prevalent in those with T2DM or the metabolic syndrome, the presence of these risk factors is associated with more progressive liver disease in NAFLD. Therefore, consider the possibility of liver fibrosis due to NAFLD in those with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) or the metabolic syndrome (Recommendation 2, Table 1).

Proactive assessment for the presence of liver fibrosis in patients at risk can permit earlier identification of significant liver disease –. The 'Scarred Liver Project', which offered community fibrosis testing to people with diabetes or obesity alongside those with hazardous alcohol consumption, identified 3688 patients at risk from a cohort of 25,018. Overall, 20% of at-risk individuals who attended a follow-up clinic had evidence of significant liver disease. Furthermore, a study including FIB-4 (discussed below) testing in annual diabetic reviews in primary care followed by transient elastography in those with an indeterminate or high FIB-4 found that 4.5% of the cohort had previously undiagnosed advanced liver disease, defined as imaging, endoscopic or biopsy evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension or HCC.

Evidence to support a case finding strategy amongst people with significant risk factors is currently limited and remains an area of divergence between current European and North American clinical guidelines. However, it is likely that a fibrosis risk-based approach in primary care may be more successful - and cost-effective - for the early identification of liver disease, than reliance on abnormal liver function or incidental finding of steatosis on imaging. However, it is also important to acknowledge that greater efforts to investigate and identify advanced liver disease in this group may result in a significant increase in primary and secondary care workload, and local service development considerations should be planned accordingly.

Summary and future research — noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA) for predicting clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) is characterized by modest effectiveness and important gaps: NILDAs appear to be at least modestly effective at assessment of CSPH and LSM as well as SSM are promising noninvasive tools for predicting CSPH, but there are limitations, including practical, biological, and technical, with available data extremely heterogeneous and cutoffs varying considerably; intrahepatic inflammatory activity causes LSM to be falsely elevated; SSM is limited by the need to accurately localize the spleen and may be technically demanding with TE, and available data suggest that LSM is more accurate at low HVPG levels than at higher levels; research is needed on the generalizability of NILDA across different populations and disease states and on the use of NILDA to assess CSPH in pediatric populations; studies using combination techniques — including combinations of imaging-based and/or blood-based NILDA are required; further study of the integration of NILDA in management algorithms for CSPH that are tied to clinical outcomes is required; utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning should allow for incorporating demographics and clinical data with NILDA to improve diagnosis and management of portal hypertension and CLD; longitudinal studies of NILDA are needed and study of the utility of NILDA in real-time disease management is also needed; further study of the utility of SSM for the prediction of CSPH is required and cost-effectiveness studies of NILDA in patient care paradigms are required.

Malignant Pseudomyxoma peritonei

Pseudomyxoma peritonei (or "jelly belly") is a unique form of peritoneal malignancy characterized by intraperitoneal accumulation of thick gelatinous material, due to rupture of an appendiceal or ovarian low-grade mucinous carcinoma.

CT shows a large amount of mass-like mucinous ascites, which produces scalloping of the visceral surfaces of the intraperitoneal organs, a finding that is most commonly observed along the margins of the liver and spleen (Fig. 16). Other CT findings include visible septa, areas of high attenuation and amorphous or curvilinear calcifications.

AASLD hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance recall algorithm — surveillance using ultrasound (US) plus alpha fetoprotein (AFP) every 6 months proceeds as follows: Vis score A with no lesion on US and AFP normal leads to repeat US; Vis score B or lesion < 1 cm on US and AFP normal prompts follow-up ultrasound in 3–6 months; Vis score C (with no lesion or lesion < 1 cm on US) directs to screening contrast-enhanced MRI or multi-phasic CT, and repeat ultrasound can be considered for some patients; and if there is a lesion ≥ 1 cm on US, or AFP ≥ 20 ng/mL, or AFP increasing, the pathway directs to diagnostic contrast-enhanced multi-phasic MRI or CT. After diagnostic imaging, the pathway includes branches for no liver lesion but significantly elevated AFP, which directs to an alternative CT/MRI imaging modality +/− chest and pelvic CT, and for a liver lesion, which directs to the diagnostic CT/MRI LI-RADS figure; when no liver lesion and low AFP level are present, the pathway returns to US surveillance.

Focal liver lesions are common in the general population. Radiology (imaging) plays a pivotal role for the diagnosis, staging, treatment planning, and follow-up of focal liver lesions. To maximize lesion detection and characterization, imaging needs to be performed with appropriate equipment by using protocols carefully designed on the basis of the underlying clinical context. In addition, the decision of an imaging modality cannot be based on the diagnostic accuracy of an imaging test solely but must also consider patient safety and cost-effectiveness.

Rigour of development

The published literature was searched using PubMed, Medline, Web of Knowledge and the Cochrane database between October 2014 and February 2016. The Guidelines Development Group met through a series of meetings and teleconferences during that time. The level of supporting evidence (graded levels 1 to 5) is assessed by the Oxford Centre For Evidence Based Medicine (Table 1). The recommendation grade is determined on the level of evidence as follows:

Table 1
Evidence grading

consistent level 1 studies;
consistent level 2 or 3 studies or extrapolations from level 1 studies;
level 4 studies or extrapolations from level 2 or 3 studies;
level 5 evidence or troublingly inconsistent or inconclusive studies of any level.

Areas of disagreement about the recommendation grade were subjected to discussion and, if necessary, voting by members of the guidelines group. Where possible, the health benefits, side effects and risks of recommendations were discussed. The guidelines were subject to peer review after submission for consideration for publication in Gut.

Clarity and presentation

Recommendations are intended to be specific to particular situations and patient groups; where necessary, different options are listed. Where the evidence and recommendation is restricted to adults, this will be stated. The term 'patients' implies all ages. Key recommendations are linked to discussion threads on a discussion forum hosted on the BSG website.

Applicability

We have discussed organisational changes that may be needed in order to implement these recommendations with the British Liver Trust, the British Association for the Study of the Liver, the British Society of Gastroenterology, the Royal College of General Practice, the Specialist Advisory Committee in Clinical Biochemistry/Royal College of Pathology and Association for Clinical Biochemistry, the British Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (BSPGHAN), Public Health England, the British Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiologists (BSGAR) and the Society of Acute Medicine. We have attempted to identify key criteria for monitoring and audit purposes.

Editorial independence and conflict of interest

Guideline group members have declared any conflicts of interest. There is full editorial independence from the BSG, which commissioned the guideline. The guideline was subsequently peer reviewed by the CSSC, who provided comments and suggestions.

There are a number of parasitic infections that can affect the liver and biliary tree. These infections can be primarily related to the liver or can include secondary hepatic involvement. Imaging can narrow down the differential diagnosis in the appropriate clinical setting, and can even clinch the diagnosis with some pathognomonic findings. The various imaging modalities can also identify disease extent, help guide management, and demonstrate response to treatment. This pictorial essay will give an overview of parasitic liver infections, and will discuss the best imaging strategies and the key imaging features to help make a timely accurate diagnosis.

### Spectrum of pitfalls, pseudolesions, and misdiagnoses in noncirrhotic liver [^114V9MZh]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to illustrate the various pitfalls, mimics, and atypical features that can lead to inaccurate diagnosis of focal lesions in a noncirrhotic liver. The content includes relevant pathogenesis and background as well as specific clues that can be used to reach an accurate diagnosis.

Conclusion

When assessing focal hepatic lesions, it is important to avoid pitfalls and misdiagnoses that can alter the management plan. Helpful strategies for avoiding pitfalls include paying close attention to the clinical history of the patient, carefully evaluating all of the available imaging studies, and being aware of the various radiologic mimics.

### CT and MR in peritoneal malignancies: pearls and pitfalls at preoperative examination [^112WZNv6]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

When the disease burden is high, it is more common to have the following patterns:
Plaque-like pattern: Plaques are irregular soft-tissue thickenings created by the confluence of multiple nodular implants typically found in the upper abdomen (Fig. 6). When plaques cover the capsular edges of intraperitoneal organs, they appear as areas of lower attenuation than the parenchyma in post-contrast scans. This creates indentations on the surface, particularly of the liver and spleen, giving a "scalloping" appearance. Fig. 6 Gastric cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis in an 81-year-old man. CT delayed phase (A), MRI T2w and DWI (b = 800 mm²/s) (B, C) axial plane showed a large implant known as a "Plaque-like" pattern (arrowheads).
Omental cake: large plaques surrounded by reactive fibrotic tissue that results in the consolidation of omental fat, which appears stratified and causes posterior displacement of the bowel relative to the anterior abdominal wall (Fig. 7). Fig. 7 Ovarian cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis in a 72-year-old woman. CT portal-venous phase (A), MRI T2w and DWI (b = 800 mm²/s) (arrowheads) (B, C), axial plane showed diffuse involvement of omental fat known as "Omental cake" pattern (arrowheads)
Mass-like pattern: this pattern involves soft-tissue masses of several centimeters, resulting from the confluence of multiple nodular implants. Masses more than 10 cm in diameter are called "bulky tumors".
Teca pattern: This involves significant engagement of the visceral peritoneum lining the loops of the small bowel, causing thickening, distortion, and fixation of the mesentery. This culminates in intestinal obstruction, a "frozen pelvis" (Fig. 8). Fig. 8 Malignant pleural mesothelioma with peritoneal implants in a 67-year-old man. CT delayed phase and portal-venous phase (A, B), axial plane. Small intestine loops were completely covered by a thickened layer of visceral peritoneum (arrowheads) known as the "Teca aspect".

### Diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-associated liver diseases: 2019 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111L6gsn]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol-associated steatosis — presentation, testing, and management: Patients with alcohol-associated steatosis are usually asymptomatic, and a palpably enlarged liver may be found in the absence of jaundice or stigmata of advanced liver disease. Among the common liver enzymes, elevations of aspartate aminotransferase and GGT are the best indicators of recent excessive alcohol consumption. Hepatic steatosis is readily identified on sonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver, and MRI is more accurate for quantifying fat than other radiologic techniques, with the added advantage that MRI can assess fat over the entire volume of the liver. Liver biopsy is rarely needed for the diagnosis of alcohol-associated steatosis, and treatment entails abstinence.

### Primary and secondary tumors of the peritoneum: key imaging features and differential diagnosis with surgical and pathological correlation [^113Q1z2q]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

The main imaging feature of PMP on CT is a high-volume loculated mucinous ascites causing mass effect on solid abdominal organs like the liver or the spleen, which develop a characteristic scalloped appearance (Fig. 17). The appendix should always be scrutinized looking for a primary AMN, that presents as a dilated appendix with hypodense material, frequent septa, thin walls and peripheral calcifications (Fig. 18). Peritoneal mucinous deposits may also present linear or punctate calcifications. A more infiltrative behavior of mucinous implants is seen in cases with high-grade histological features and signet ring cells, with frequent vascular involvement of the epigastric region (Fig. 19). Ovarian involvement in the form of hypodense mucinous implants is also frequent, and must not be misdiagnosed with a primary ovarian neoplasm. Solid peritoneal implants and omental cake may also be seen, more often on PMP with high-grade histological features and signet ring cells, but they can also be present in patients with low-grade histological features. In this sense, it is not unusual to find in the same abdominal CT scan signs of low-grade disease, such as hypodense loculated ascites representing acellular mucin pools, coexisting with high-grade features like dense areas of infiltrative appearance representing mucinous carcinomatosis (Fig. 20).

Hydatid/echinococcal cysts — epidemiology, transmission, features, and imaging are summarized as follows: Cystic echinococcosis or hydatid cysts are caused by Echinococcus granulosus infection and are most commonly seen in rural sheep grazing areas with a wide geographical distribution. Humans serve as accidental intermediate hosts after ingestion of contaminated foods, water, or soil with Echinococcus eggs or organ meat from infected animals, after which eggs hatch in the small intestine, penetrate the intestinal wall, and migrate via the venous system to organs including the liver and lungs. Cysts are often asymptomatic early, but larger cysts can cause abdominal discomfort and pain, compress the bile ducts leading to obstructive jaundice or cholangitis, and rupture or leak causing severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis, peritonitis, ascites, and septic shock. Imaging appearances vary, and the WHO-Informal Working Group on Echinococcosis classification details ultrasound-based staging characteristics that help guide treatment options; management varies by cyst characteristics, clinical presentation, and center expertise.

### Noninvasive imaging diagnosis of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome: a pictorial review [^116exeSg]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

SOS is a life-threating liver disorder related to vascular injury. At present, a timely and reliable diagnosis is unachievable using established, clinically based criteria. Recently, noninvasive imaging technologies have assumed growing importance in identifying occurrences of SOS, monitoring its progression, or predicting patient prognosis. Hemodynamic changes of hepatic vessels, hepatic parenchymal heterogeneity, impaired cellular function, liver fibrosis, and an array of findings signaling portal hypertension (i.e. hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, thickened gallbladder wall, and periportal edema) are all characteristic of SOS in noninvasive imaging studies. Coupled with clinical data, these imaging attributes of SOS may improve the diagnostic accuracy, especially in late-onset and asymptomatic cases, ensuring timely medical intervention.

Further prospective studies are needed to better gauge the diagnostic utility of imaging markers in terms of accuracy and specificity for SOS. Moreover, a comprehensive diagnostic and predictive model must be developed, incorporating clinical, etiologic, and imaging parameters.

### Posttraumatic bile leaks: role of diagnostic imaging and impact on patient outcome [^114EDcNf]. Emergency Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of bile leaks on patient morbidity and hospital course following blunt and penetrating liver trauma. Forty patients who underwent hepatobiliary scintigraphy after trauma were included. Scintigraphic results were classified as follows: free intraperitoneal bile leak, contained bile leak, and no bile leak. Outcomes measured were length of hospital stay, number of procedures required, and number of subsequent imaging studies. Bile leaks were identified in 25% of patients. Eight percent had free intraperitoneal leaks, 18% contained bile leaks, and 73% had no bile leak. One study was nondiagnostic due to poor hepatic function. Mean hospitalization was as follows: free bile leak group, 53 days; contained bile leak group, 10 days; no bile leak group, 14 days. Patients with free intraperitoneal bile leak had more imaging studies and procedures than patients without free bile leak. Patients with liver injury and free intraperitoneal bile leak have longer hospitalizations and undergo more therapeutic procedures than those without, who respond to conservative management.

### Liver injury: what you need to know [^116cSWLz]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The liver is the most commonly injured abdominal solid organ regardless of mechanism. The majority of liver injuries are grades I to III, with 12% to 20% as grades IV and V. In the hemodynamically stable patient or prompt responder to resuscitation, 85% to 90% of blunt liver injuries can be managed nonoperatively, regardless of the grade of injury. The promulgation of nonoperative management has resulted in decreased overall mortality for blunt liver injury. On the other hand, over the past 30 years, major advances in resuscitation science, intensive care, damage-control surgery, and nonoperative adjuncts have done little to reduce the operative morbidity and mortality of grades IV and V liver injuries. Angiography with embolization is often effective in stopping bleeding. However, angioembolization confers additional risk of complications (i.e., major hepatic necrosis and sepsis). This review will briefly present critical surgical anatomy and grading systems for liver trauma, followed by organ-specific diagnostic, resuscitation, and triage considerations. It will review important limitations, risk factors for failure, and complications associated with nonoperative management and angioembolization. This article presents operative techniques and pearls for surgical treatment of the most severe injuries, including adjuncts for hemorrhage control. Finally, we suggest the 6 Ps as an operative strategy for liver injury: Push-Pack-Pringle-Put Back-Phone-Pivot.

Liver tests after liver transplantation (LT) — monitoring and evaluation are guided by individualized schedules and targeted diagnostics. The frequency of monitoring with liver tests should be individualized by the transplant center according to the time from LT, the complications from LT, the stability of serial test results, and the underlying cause (grade 1, level A). When abnormal liver tests are recognized in a healthy, asymptomatic LT recipient, it is reasonable to repeat the tests in 1 to 2 weeks, and investigations should include a thorough history and examination, appropriate laboratory tests, and Doppler ultrasound of the liver. Depending on the pattern of liver tests, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and sonography may be appropriate (grade 1, level A), and appropriate biliary imaging includes endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and/or ultrasound. Liver histology should be obtained when parenchymal injury is suspected as the cause of abnormal liver tests (grade 1, level A), and it should not be assumed without appropriate histological confirmation that abnormal liver tests represent immunemediated damage.

For nonsurgical candidates, expert sources "recommend ablative therapies or stereotactic body radiotherapy". Systemic therapy "is not often recommended" and "should only be considered" with progression or marked systemic symptoms, with reported outcomes showing "overall survival generally less than 2 years".

### Surgical management of AAST grades III-V hepatic trauma by damage control surgery with perihepatic packing and definitive hepatic repair-single centre experience [^1129cXvK]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Discusson

In hemodynamically unstable patients with hemorrhage from major liver injury and massive hemoperitoneum on abdominal imaging, the strategy and techniques for bleeding control can be extremely demanding and complex. We presented the results of surgical treatment of 121 trauma patients with severe bleeding liver injuries.

Since Pringle's publication of inflow vascular control on liver, the primary focus of trauma surgeons was to find the best way to achieve hemo-stasis, bile-stasis and infection control in hepatic injuries. Today the focus of trauma surgeons is selection of appropriate patients for operative management, who are the candidates for surgery and when to operate. The general contraindications for none-operative management of liver trauma included the hemodynamic instability, extravasations of intravenous contrast on abdominal imaging, expanding hematoma and grade IV and V liver injury. According to the study conducted by Coimbra et al. nonoperative management has been accepted as treatment of choice only for stable patients with low grade of injury. Fang et al. study of 214 patients with a hepatic injury showed that the independent predictors for the surgical treatment even in hemodynamically stable patients included intraperitoneal contrast extravasation and hemoperitoneum in six compartments on CT scan. FAST is able to sensitively detect hemoperitoneum presented as free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis, but its numerous limitations have been recognized. MSCT is the imaging modality of choice in evaluating hemodynamically stable patients with suspected hepatic injury. Abdominal CT accurately defines the morphology and extent of the hepatic trauma, identifies associated visceral injuries and depicts the amount of hemoperitoneum. It is important to know that life- threatening liver injuries can be detected by MSCT with high sensitivity.

### Hepatic trauma: contemporary management [^1168hBNE]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

In the introduction, I posed several questions that were issues/controversies. The answers will probably be interpreted as equally controversial. I do not believe there is strong evidence that the incidence of liver injuries has increased. Diagnostic modalities have contributed to this seeming increase, as well as population increases and the concentration of severe liver injuries in trauma centers, now present in 35 states. I believe there are more blunt injuries now, relative to penetrating injuries. The peak of penetrating injuries occurred in the 1970s and 1980s and lasted almost 2 decades. I believe some authors are overly enthusiastic for nonoperative management. I am particularly critical of authors who do not include all components of the surgical armamentarium into their treatment of severe liver injuries. I also believe that the complications following nonoperative management are currently unacceptable, as documented in the references. I have shared with you the strategies for operative management, but there are equally good or better strategies in the surgical literature.

### The precarious state of the liver after a fontan operation: summary of a multidisciplinary symposium [^114xinJx]. Pediatric Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Where Do We Go from Here? A Recommendation for Systematic Evaluation of the Liver After the Fontan Operation

In our view, an abundance of data confirms the presence of an indolent but devastating pathologic process affecting the liver after the Fontan operation. Although invasive and still not ideal, liver biopsy appears to be the most accurate means for assessing the degree of hepatic pathology present. Realizing the potential insult and ongoing damage, our group consensus after the Symposium is to recommend initiation of a program for evaluation of liver status through tissue biopsy analysis, framed within the context of a contemporary detailed characterization of cardiovascular status. We plan to evaluate all patients approximately 10 years after the Fontan operation. The evaluation will include a liver biopsy combined with cardiovascular assessment through cardiac catheterization and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.

Although many questions remain, it is clear that liver damage is taking place in survivors of Fontan surgery. Is a program of proactive liver biopsy and cardiac evaluation after Fontan operation to be considered investigational research? In our view, assessing the degree of liver pathology for any individual patient may be considered a new clinical care approach and is not research.

Individual patient care will be dictated based on the findings. For example, if significant bridging fibrosis is discovered within the context of elevated central venous pressure, then initiation of pulmonary vasodilator therapy may be considered. Such patients would be "flagged" and referred to the care of hepatology specialists for closer serial follow-up evaluation and management. Furthermore, patients with extensive liver pathology could be considered for possible heart transplantation therapy or could be at the top of the list for consideration of more innovative therapies such as mechanical assist and support devices currently in development.

No doubt there will be interest in creating generalizable knowledge as the clinical experience with detailed liver evaluation in our Fontan population grows. In particular, development of noninvasive correlates with the liver biopsy findings is essential. Creation of a detailed registry of patients who will undergo hepatic and cardiovascular evaluation at this decade milestone will be of great importance. We endorse a shift in philosophy, from one of reactivity to the onset of clinical complications to a proactive, systematic clinical investigation of end-organ function in our survivors of the Fontan operation. Liver pathology is present, likely progressive, and demands a better understanding both for the individual patient and for the community of survivors, which is rapidly expanding.

### An exploration of radiological signs in post-intervention liver complications [^111BVRvs]. European Journal of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The advent and progression of radiological techniques in the past few decades have revolutionized the diagnostic and therapeutic landscape for liver diseases. These minimally invasive interventions, ranging from biopsies to complex therapeutic procedures like transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement and transarterial embolization, offer substantial benefits for the treatment of patients with liver diseases. They provide accurate tissue diagnosis, allow real-time visualization, and render targeted treatment for hepatic lesions with enhanced precision. Despite their advantages, these procedures are not without risks, with the potential for complications that can significantly impact patient outcomes. It is imperative for radiologists to recognize the signs of these complications promptly to mitigate further health deterioration. Ultrasound, CT, and MRI are widely utilized examinations for monitoring the complications. This article presents an overarching review of the most commonly encountered hepatobiliary complications post-radiological interventions, emphasizing their imaging characteristics to improve patient post-procedure management.

### A phase II study evaluating the use of concurrent mitomycin C and capecitabine in patients with advanced unresectable pseudomyxoma peritonei [^115nRAft]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

This is the first evaluation of systemic chemotherapy in patients with advanced unresectable PMP. Within the limitation of a non-randomised design, the data show that over one-third of patients appear to benefit from treatment with MCap chemotherapy without high rates of severe toxicity or reduction in quality of life.

A potential limitation of the study was the failure to quantify disease response using volume-based criteria. The role of CT scanning is well outlined for initial diagnosis. Early disease is characterised by an appendiceal tumour, and deposits predominantly on the diaphragmatic surface, around the liver and spleen and within the pouch of Douglas; as the disease progresses, deposits around the liver and spleen show scalloping and compress the adjacent organs, particularly the stomach. On contrast enhanced CT, PMP deposits are predominantly of low density, but may show septa and solid elements, likely to represent mucinous tumour deposits, encysted collections of mucin and fibrosis. Because of the diffuse nature of the disease, measurement of PMP disease volume is challenging. The RECIST criteria are not applicable, as these specifically exclude ascites and cystic areas as measurable lesions. Changes in volume of disease within the peritoneal cavity may be assessed in some cases by measurement of relatively well-defined deposits (encysted mucin) or by measurement of the radial diameter of deposits over the surface of the liver or spleen. However, where there are diffuse deposits, volume of disease cannot be meaningfully assessed using unidimensional or bidimensional measurements. Moreover, apparent changes in the burden of intraperitoneal disease may reflect changes in the volume of mucinous ascites and not of solid tumour. The baseline scan and all subsequent scans were carried out at Christie Hospital using the same protocol. All scans were reported by radiologists who are experienced in the radiological evaluation of PMP.

Wilson disease — brain imaging — Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain can be helpful in establishing a diagnosis for patients with unexplained neurological and psychiatric symptoms and frequently reveals findings consistent with Wilson disease, with typical MRI findings including signal changes in the basal ganglia, thalami, pons, and white matter, as well as atrophy; the so-called "face of the giant panda sign", which consists of increased T2 signal in the midbrain, has been considered pathognomonic for Wilson disease, but several other findings are more commonly seen. Patients with extensive changes on brain imaging, such as evidence of tissue cavitation, are less likely to improve with treatment, and in general, repeated MRIs are not useful for determining prognosis or monitoring neurological progression. Computerized tomography (CT) of the brain has limited utility for assessing Wilson disease.

### Noninvasive tools to assess liver disease [^113LeEnq]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To improve understanding of recent developments in the noninvasive assessment of fibrosis and their potential clinical application to a range of chronic liver diseases.

Recent Findings

Many noninvasive tests have evolved from their primary validation in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection to integration into clinical management algorithms for chronic liver disease of varying cause. Recent studies consider the use of these techniques in sequence or in combination, and compare the performance of serum and imaging-based noninvasive techniques to identify patients with significant fibrosis, or those at most risk of clinical sequelae from advanced-stage disease. Methods developed in chronic hepatitis C have now been applied in different chronic liver diseases, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, HIV/HCV co-infection and primary biliary cirrhosis. A number of new management algorithms have been developed to facilitate the integration of noninvasive techniques into clinical practice.

Summary

Noninvasive tools to assess liver diseases continue to evolve. New imaging technologies have been developed. Existing biomarkers and imaging modalities have been better integrated into clinical practice algorithms, and applied to different chronic liver diseases. Noninvasive techniques will likely continue to be refined and play an important role in the future management of patients with chronic liver disease.

### The diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^117StPTZ]. Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) definitions — NAFLD requires evidence of hepatic steatosis by imaging or histology and absence of secondary causes such as significant alcohol consumption, long-term use of a steatogenic medication, or monogenic hereditary disorders; histologically, NAFLD is categorized as nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NAFL is defined as the presence of ≥ 5% HS without evidence of hepatocellular injury in the form of hepatocyte ballooning. NASH is defined as the presence of ≥ 5% HS and inflammation with hepatocyte injury (e.g., ballooning), with or without any fibrosis. For "advanced" fibrosis, this guidance refers specifically to stages 3 or 4, that is, bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis.

### Liver biopsy [^112KDkkd]. Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Indications for liver biopsy — overview states that histological assessment of the liver, and thus liver biopsy, is a cornerstone in the evaluation and management of patients with liver disease. It is likely that liver biopsy will remain a valuable diagnostic tool even as sensitive and relatively accurate blood tests have become widely available, although noninvasive techniques (imaging, blood tests) may replace use of liver histology particularly for assessment of the severity of liver fibrosis. This guideline deals exclusively with liver biopsy as it relates to adult liver disease. As of 2009, liver biopsy currently has three major roles: (1) for diagnosis, (2) for assessment of prognosis (disease staging), and/or (3) to assist in making therapeutic management decisions. Although liver biopsy is often essential in the management of patients with liver disease, physicians and patients may find it to be a difficult undertaking because of the associated risks.

- If testing for NAFLD, start with the fibrosis-4 index, which uses platelet and transaminase measurements. Evaluate intermediate- or higher-risk patients with transient elastography or an enhanced liver fibrosis laboratory panel.
- Weight loss is key to managing NAFLD and NASH; lifestyle interventions, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, and bariatric surgery all improve liver disease. From the AFP Editors. Epidemiology Because NAFLD is defined by hepatic steatosis in more than 5% of hepatocytes in a biopsy sample, the prevalence must be estimated. It is important to diagnosis the lack of significant recent or ongoing alcohol consumption or other known causes of liver disease. Significant alcohol use is defined as more than 21 standard drinks per week for men and 14 drinks per week for women. Most of the serious sequelae from NAFLD come from those with NASH.

Approximately 20% of patients with NASH will develop significant liver disease. NASH is among the top causes of hepato-cellular carcinoma. TESTING FOR NAFLD The first step to testing for NAFLD is to estimate fibrosis through the fibrosis-4 index, the most highly validated initial test, which uses platelet and transaminase measurements. The fibrosis-4 index has a high negative predictive value but low positive predictive value. Other suggested fibrosis indexes appear to further overestimate fibrosis. Alanine transaminase levels alone cannot rule out NAFLD because one-half of patients with NAFLD and type 2 diabetes have levels in the normal range. Liver ultrasonography is not effective for screening because of low sensitivity for mild to moderate steatosis. For an intermediate- or high-risk fibrosis-4 index, liver stiffness should be measured using transient elastography.

This testing can rule out fibrosis with negative predictive values between 91% and 99%, depending on the specification used. Magnetic resonance elastography is also accurate, but it is less widely available. If transient elastography is not available, an enhanced liver fibrosis laboratory panel can be used to estimate the rate of liver extracellular matrix metabolism. Use of the fibrosis-4 index and enhanced liver fibrosis testing reduces unnecessary hepatology referrals and increases identification of patients with advanced fibrosis.
