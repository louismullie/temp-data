## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a 7-year-old girl with 3 days of vomiting, high anion gap metabolic acidosis, and rapid improvement after 500 mL normal saline, and wants to understand the most likely diagnosis and mechanism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the acid-base pattern and its severity. Then, I should verify the respiratory compensation and whether it is appropriate. Next, I will consider the differential for high anion gap metabolic acidosis in a child and prioritize starvation or vomiting-related ketoacidosis. After that, I need to check for mixed disorders and whether the delta ratio supports a pure process. Finally, I will reconcile the rapid clinical improvement with fluids and outline next steps and pitfalls to avoid, including when to consider toxic ingestions or inborn errors of metabolism.

> Let me first confirm the acid-base disorder and its magnitude. The pH is 7.32 with bicarbonate around 15–16 mEq/L and base excess −8.1 mEq/L, which together indicate a metabolic acidosis, and the calculated anion gap of 21 mmol/L is clearly elevated, establishing a high anion gap metabolic acidosis rather than a normal anion gap process [^115oS1GG] [^112mhVzE].

> Wait, let me verify the respiratory compensation before I anchor on a metabolic cause. Using Winter's formula, expected PaCO2 ≈ 1.5 × HCO3 + 8 ± 2, which gives an expected PaCO2 around 31–35 mmHg. The observed PaCO2 of 28.5 mmHg sits just below that window, suggesting either appropriate compensation or a mild additional respiratory alkalosis, but I should be cautious not to overcall a mixed disorder without corroborating clinical context [^115oS1GG] [^115NbUJh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiologies that are less likely in a healthy 7-year-old. I need to check for common pediatric causes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis: diabetic ketoacidosis is excluded by the normal glucose, lactic acidosis is less likely without shock or sepsis, and toxic ingestions such as methanol or ethylene glycol are improbable without suggestive history or osmolal gap, so starvation or vomiting-related ketoacidosis rises to the top of the differential in this scenario [^115oS1GG] [^1164Bq47].

> Let me consider the pathophysiology of starvation or vomiting-related ketoacidosis. Prolonged vomiting with poor oral intake shifts metabolism toward fatty acid oxidation, generating beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, which are unmeasured anions that increase the anion gap; importantly, the degree of acidosis is often mild to moderate and can improve rapidly with intravenous fluids and dextrose, which suppresses ketogenesis and restores bicarbonate via hepatic metabolism of ketones [^116VYfqK] [^111ggN3K].

> I should double-check for a mixed disorder using the delta ratio. The delta gap calculation (ΔAG/ΔHCO3) is roughly (21 − 12)/(24 − 15.6) ≈ 9/8.4 ≈ 1.07, which falls within 1–2 and supports a pure high anion gap metabolic acidosis without a superimposed non–anion gap acidosis or metabolic alkalosis, aligning with a straightforward starvation/vomiting ketoacidosis picture [^115oS1GG] [^113WkXBH].

> But wait, what if the vomiting itself is a clue to a cyclic process rather than a simple gastroenteritis. Cyclic vomiting syndrome in children can present with episodes of repeated emesis and, during attacks, may show mild mitochondrial dysfunction with anion gap metabolic acidosis, lactic acidosis, ketonuria, and occasionally hypoglycemia; these abnormalities often resolve with supportive care and dextrose, and the anion gap in CVS is frequently in the 15–20 range, which matches this case [^112iZ4A5] [^112DZbAE].

> I will now examine why the patient improved so quickly after 500 mL of normal saline. Initially, I thought the rapid improvement might reflect correction of significant volume depletion, but wait, 500 mL is a modest bolus and the kidney function is normal, so the more plausible mechanism is that intravenous fluids restored perfusion and, critically, dextrose-containing fluids suppress ketogenesis, while normal saline itself can transiently lower bicarbonate via a chloride load. However, in this case the clinical trajectory is best explained by reversal of ketogenesis and endogenous bicarbonate regeneration rather than a large chloride-mediated acidosis from saline alone [^111ggN3K] [^115JyfUH].

> Next, I should review what to do now to confirm the diagnosis and prevent recurrence. Let me first confirm ketone measurements with serum beta-hydroxybutyrate and a urinalysis for ketonuria, then obtain a basic metabolic panel to trend bicarbonate and anion gap over the next 24–48 hours. Given the pediatric context and the acid-base pattern, I should also consider a targeted history for cyclic vomiting syndrome and, if episodes recur or are severe, discuss referral for metabolic or neurologic evaluation per consensus guidance [^112iZ4A5].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am not missing a toxic ingestion or inborn error. The absence of an elevated osmolal gap, the normal renal function, and the lack of red flags such as severe hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, or persistent acidosis make toxic alcohols and most inborn errors less likely here; however, if the anion gap fails to normalize, if there are recurrent episodes with concerning features, or if there is a suggestive medication history, I should broaden the workup to include targeted toxicology screens and consider entities like pyroglutamic acidosis or other rare causes of high anion gap acidosis [^115oS1GG] [^1164Bq47].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis is coherent: this 7-year-old most likely has starvation or vomiting-related ketoacidosis, possibly within the spectrum of cyclic vomiting syndrome, producing a pure high anion gap metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation. The rapid improvement after fluids and dextrose reflects suppression of ketogenesis and endogenous bicarbonate recovery, and the next steps are to document ketones, trend the anion gap, and evaluate for CVS triggers and prevention strategies [^116VYfqK] [^115oS1GG] [^112iZ4A5].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **starvation ketoacidosis** due to 3 days of vomiting and poor oral intake, causing increased ketone production and a high anion gap metabolic acidosis [^116VYfqK]. The patient's **rapid improvement after normal saline** reflects correction of dehydration and increased renal perfusion, which enhances ketone clearance and bicarbonate regeneration, restoring acid–base balance [^111xeN5f]. Key supporting features include the high anion gap, low bicarbonate, appropriate respiratory compensation, normal renal function, and non-diabetic status [^115oS1GG].

---

## Pathophysiology of starvation ketoacidosis

Starvation ketoacidosis arises when **insufficient carbohydrates** force reliance on fatty acid oxidation, generating ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, acetone) that accumulate as unmeasured anions and increase the anion gap [^1164Bq47]. Persistent vomiting accelerates this by causing caloric deprivation, dehydration, and electrolyte losses that further impair metabolism and acid–base homeostasis [^116uUutn].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting starvation ketoacidosis

Several findings in this patient align with **starvation ketoacidosis**:

- **High anion gap metabolic acidosis**: Anion gap 21 mmol/L, bicarbonate 15.6 mEq/L, pH 7.32, consistent with ketoacidosis [^1164Bq47].
- **Normal renal function**: Creatinine 56 µmol/L, urea 5.6 mg/dL, arguing against renal failure as the cause of acidosis [^1128dyGX].
- **Non-diabetic status**: Normal glucose (3.6 mmol/L) excludes diabetic ketoacidosis [^notfound].
- **Appropriate respiratory compensation**: PCO2 28.5 mmHg indicates expected hyperventilation for metabolic acidosis [^1117qBur].

---

## Role of normal saline in correcting acidosis

Normal saline improves acidosis in starvation ketoacidosis via **volume repletion** and enhanced renal perfusion, increasing ketone clearance and bicarbonate regeneration [^notfound]. It also supplies chloride, which helps normalize the anion gap as ketones are metabolized and excreted [^115JyfUH].

---

## Alternative diagnoses considered and excluded

| **Alternative diagnosis** | **Reason for exclusion** |
|-|-|
| Diabetic ketoacidosis | Normal glucose level [^notfound] |
| Lactic acidosis | No evidence of tissue hypoperfusion or sepsis |
| Renal failure | Normal renal function tests [^notfound] |
| Toxic ingestions (e.g. methanol, ethylene glycol) | No history of ingestion, normal osmolal gap [^notfound] |
| Sepsis | No fever, leukocytosis, or clinical signs of infection |

---

## Clinical implications and management

This case underscores the importance of recognizing **starvation ketoacidosis** in children with prolonged vomiting and poor intake. Management centers on:

- **Volume repletion**: Intravenous fluids to correct dehydration and improve renal perfusion [^116VYfqK].
- **Glucose supplementation**: Dextrose-containing fluids suppress ketogenesis and hasten recovery [^111ggN3K].
- **Electrolyte correction**: Address hypokalemia and other deficits as needed [^116VYfqK].
- **Monitoring**: Serial acid–base parameters and electrolytes to ensure resolution [^113uEWNk].

---

The patient's high anion gap metabolic acidosis is best explained by **starvation ketoacidosis** from vomiting and poor intake, with rapid improvement after normal saline due to restored perfusion and ketone clearance. This diagnosis is supported by the acid–base pattern, normal renal function, non-diabetic status, and the clinical course.

### Approach to the evaluation of a patient with an increased serum osmolal gap and high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis [^111QBddX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

An increase in serum osmolality and serum osmolal gap with or without high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis is an important clue to exposure to one of the toxic alcohols, which include methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or isopropanol. However, the increase in serum osmolal gap and metabolic acidosis can occur either together or alone depending on several factors, including baseline serum osmolal gap, molecular weight of the alcohol, and stage of metabolism of the alcohol. In addition, other disorders, including diabetic or alcoholic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and lactic acidosis, can cause high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis associated with an increased serum osmolal gap and therefore should be explored in the differential diagnosis. It is essential for clinicians to understand the value and limitations of osmolal gap to assist in reaching the correct diagnosis and initiating appropriate treatment. In this teaching case, we present a systematic approach to diagnosing high serum osmolality and increased serum osmolal gap with or without high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis.

At the time of referral, the patient's vital signs were as follows: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was full, body temperature was 36.5 °C, blood pressure was 112/70 mmHg, heart rate was 78 beats per minute, and SpO₂ was 99%. On physical examination, the patient's vital signs were stable. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. There were no signs of volume depletion, or of fluid overload.

Laboratory findings on admission are summarized in Table 1. Venous blood gas analysis revealed metabolic acidosis, with a pH of 7.26 and a bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) level of 12.6 mmol/L. The calculated anion gap was 9.4 mEq/L, consistent with a normal anion gap acidosis. Serum creatinine was 0.63 mg/dL. Serum sodium, potassium, and chloride levels were 140 mEq/L, 3.6 mEq/L, and 118 mEq/L, respectively. Urinalysis showed a persistently high urine pH of 8.0. Urinary sodium, potassium, chloride, and urea nitrogen levels were 47 mEq/L, 52 mEq/L, 64 mEq/L, and 353 mg/dL, respectively. A positive urine anion gap of 35 mEq/L and a urine osmolality gap (UOG) of 15.2 mEq/L (with urine osmolality < 100 mOsm/kg) were consistent with a diagnosis of dRTA. Other laboratory results revealed no significant abnormalities (Table 1). The clozapine trough level was 404.7 ng/mL, within the therapeutic range of 350–600 ng/mL. Computed tomography (CT) of the kidneys showed no structural abnormalities or evidence of nephrocalcinosis.

A 24-year-old woman presented with a history of persistent vomiting for at least 3 months. This resulted in severe dehydration with risk of acute kidney injury. In addition to volume depletion, loss of gastric fluid resulted in a specific metabolic derangement-hypokalaemic, hypochloraemic normal anion gap metabolic alkalosis with a reduced ionised calcium concentration and paradoxical aciduria. These metabolic changes were reflected in her ECG. Investigation demonstrated acquired gastric outflow tract obstruction secondary to a pyloric peptic ulcer. The patient was resuscitated with intravenous crystalloid and electrolyte supplements. The acquired pyloric stenosis was treated medically with a proton pump inhibitor and Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy with excellent recovery.

Metabolic acidosis is encountered frequently in intensive care and common causes include lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, or renal failure. We describe a patient presenting to intensive care with a rare cause of metabolic acidosis associated with an increased anion gap: multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. The pathophysiology of this condition is discussed along with potential treatment options.

### Severe euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis of multifactorial etiology in a type 2 diabetic patient treated with empagliflozin: case report and literature review [^1164iDy2]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are a relatively novel class of oral medications for the treatment of Type 2 DM with a generally acceptable safety profile. However, these agents have been associated with rare events of a serious and potentially life-threatening complication named euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (euDKA). euDKA is not identical with the typical diabetic ketoacidosis, as it often presents with serious metabolic acidosis but only mild to moderate glucose and anion gap elevation.

Case presentation

We report a case of a 51-year old female with Type 2 DM treated with an SGLT-2 inhibitor, developing severe metabolic acidosis with only mild blood glucose elevation after a routine surgery. A careful evaluation of involved factors led to the diagnosis of euDKA, followed by cautious application of simple therapeutic measures that resulted in complete restoration of acidosis and glycemic control in less than 48-h.

Conclusions

Euglycemic ketoacidosis is a rare but rather serious complication of SGLT-2 inhibitors use, often with a multifactorial etiology. Its atypical presentation requires a high level of awareness by physicians as early recognition of this complication can quickly and safely restore acid-base balance.

### A case report of paracetamol related pyroglutamic acidosis: mind the gap in a malnourished patient [^113YJCvu]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pyroglutamic acidosis is a rare cause of high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Most cases of paracetamol related pyroglutamic acidosis are described in malnourished women and patients with kidney/liver failure, alcohol use or severe sepsis. In this report, we describe how pyroglutamic acidosis could be related to the use of chronic therapeutic paracetamol with only malnutrition as an associated risk factor.

Case Presentation

We report a case of a 67-year-old male patient developing a pyroglutamic acidosis. The patient was initially admitted to hospital for infectious osteoarthritis and developed a metabolic acidosis during his hospital stay. Analgesics included daily therapeutic doses of paracetamol. What makes our case unusual is that our malnourished male patient did not have renal or hepatic failure. The diagnosis of paracetamol related pyroglutamic acidosis was made after ruling out the main causes of metabolic acidosis. It was further confirmed by urine organic acids measurement showing a markedly elevated level of pyroglutamic aciduria. Paracetamol was discontinued allowing a prompt correction of the anion gap.

Conclusion

This case is a representative of pyroglutamic acidosis related to chronic therapeutic paracetamol with only malnutrition as an associated risk factor. Physicians should be aware of such unusual cause of metabolic acidosis, which may be more common than expected in hospitalized patients. A high clinical suspicion is needed when urine organic acids analysis is not available.

Table 1
Laboratory data at diagnosis

The patient displayed a high-anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA): serum anion gap (AG), corrected for hypoalbuminemia equalled 25.3, c AG = AG + 2.5 (4-albumine in g/dL). This HAGMA has an appropriate respiratory response. We compared the increase in serum anion gap and the bicarbonate deficit using the delta ratio that indicated an absence of concurrent metabolic acidosis due to the loss of bicarbonate. The most common causes of HAGMA are listed in the mnemonic "GOLDMARK": Glycol, Oxoproline, L lactate, D lactate, Methanol, Aspirin, Renal failure and Ketoacidosis. Our patient had a controlled infection and no evidence of hypovolemia or hemodynamic instability along with a normal serum lactate level. Alternative causes of HAGMA due to ketoacidosis or salicylate abuse were ruled out. HAGMA in our case does not generate an osmolal gap: the measured osmolality was only 10 mOsmol/Kg greater than his calculated osmolality (normal value ≤ 10) making the ingestion of alcohol or glycol unlikely. The possibility of pyroglutamic acidosis due to the chronic use of paracetamol was suspected (1–2 g daily for 6 months). Paracetamol was withheld and alternative medications for pain management were prescribed. Serum amino acid levels were checked and showed a generalized hypoaminoacidemia consistent with the malnourished status of our patient. (Table 1)

The diagnosis was further confirmed by urine organic acids measurement, showing a markedly elevated level of pyroglutamic aciduria (932 µmol per mmol of creatininuria, normal < 18 µmol/mmol).

Clinical case description

The proband was a grossly nondysmorphic 2-year-old female, height at the 53rd percentile and weight at the 56th percentile, daughter of a consanguineous union who was born at full term by normal standard vaginal delivery and presented with dehydration and acidosis precipitated by minor illnesses. At 21 months of age, the patient presented to the emergency room with a 1-day history of fever, rhinorrhea, foul-smelling urine, and decreased oral intake and was found to be Influenza B positive. Of note, the parents denied history of diarrhea. Initial vital signs in the emergency department were normal for age and included heart rate of 140 beats/min, respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min, and blood pressure of 86/58 mmHg. Physical exam was notable only for rhinorrhea, and no increased work of breathing was noted. Initial labs were significant for an extremely low serum tCO 2 at 7 mmol/L. Serum sodium was 129 mmol/L (reference range: 136–145), potassium was 3.2 mmol/L (reference range: 3.5–5.1), chloride was 111 mmol/L (reference range: 98–108), blood urea nitrogen was 14 mg/dL (reference range: 6–23), serum creatinine was 0.32 mg/dL (reference range: 0.24–0.41), serum calcium level was 8.6 mg/dL (reference range: 8.6–10.3), and serum magnesium level was 1.9 mg/dL (reference range: 1.6–2.3). Intravenous hydration was initiated. In addition, urinalysis revealed a pH of 6.0, specific gravity of 1.018 mOsm/kg, ketones at 80 mg/dL, and 30 mg/dL of protein. Urine was negative for blood, leukocyte esterase, and nitrites. A complete blood count revealed a normal white blood count at 12.82 × 10 3 /mcL and differential was notable for 15% bands. Chest X-ray was normal. The patient was hospitalized for continued intravenous hydration and noted to have a persistent metabolic acidosis despite aggressive hydration, improved appetite, and resolution of symptoms. During the course of the hospitalization, urine electrolytes were obtained, which included a urine calcium:creatinine ratio of 0.06 (normal < 0.2). Liver enzymes were noted to be elevated to a maximum of AST 583 u/L (reference range: 4–32) and ALT 390 u/L (reference range: 4–33). A single parathyroid hormone level during the hospitalization was noted to be low at 11.39 pg/ml (reference range: 15–65 pg/mL). In addition, the patient was noted to have altered mental status as demonstrated by an abnormal gait. Computerized tomography of the head without contrast revealed extensive bilateral symmetric calcification within the basal ganglia, subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, and within the cerebellar hemispheres. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain also noted widespread intracranial calcifications. Mental status gradually returned to baseline over the course of several days, suggesting her transient alternation in mental status was due to the presenting infectious process and biochemical abnormalities. Abdominal and renal ultrasound were normal, and renal calcifications were not seen. The patient was discharged home on citric acid/sodium citrate 20 mEq by mouth three times daily (equivalent to 4 mEq/kg/day). At baseline, and while on citric acid/sodium citrate, the patient continued to demonstrate a persistent metabolic acidosis.

### Fomepizole (Antizol) [^113uEWNk]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Treatment Guidelines: If ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning is left untreated, the natural progression of the poisoning leads to accumulation of toxic metabolites, including glycolic and oxalic acids (ethylene glycol intoxication) and formic acid (methanol intoxication). These metabolites can induce metabolic acidosis, nausea/ vomiting, seizures, stupor, coma, calcium oxaluria, acute tubular necrosis, blindness, and death. The diagnosis of these poisonings may be difficult because ethylene glycol and methanol concentrations diminish in the blood as they are metabolized to their respective metabolites. Hence, both ethylene glycol and methanol concentrations and acid base balance, as determined by serum electrolyte (anion gap) and/or arterial blood gas analysis, should be frequently monitored and used to guide treatment.

Treatment consists of blocking the formation of toxic metabolites using inhibitors of alcohol dehydrogenase, such as Antizol®, and correction of metabolic abnormalities. In patients with high ethylene glycol or methanol concentrations (≥ 50 mg/dL), significant metabolic acidosis, or renal failure, hemodialysis should be considered to remove ethylene glycol or methanol and the respective toxic metabolites of these alcohols.

Treatment with Antizol:

Begin Antizol®treatment immediately upon suspicion of ethylene glycol or methanol ingestion based on patient history and/or anion gap metabolic acidosis, increased osmolar gap, visual disturbances, or oxalate crystals in the urine, OR a documented serum ethylene glycol or methanol concentration greater than 20 mg/dL.

### Metabolic acidosis or respiratory alkalosis? Evaluation of a low plasma bicarbonate using the urine anion gap [^1116ZUbJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Hypobicarbonatemia, or a reduced bicarbonate concentration in plasma, is a finding seen in 3 acid-base disorders: metabolic acidosis, chronic respiratory alkalosis and mixed metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. Hypobicarbonatemia due to chronic respiratory alkalosis is often misdiagnosed as a metabolic acidosis and mistreated with the administration of alkali therapy. Proper diagnosis of the cause of hypobicarbonatemia requires integration of the laboratory values, arterial blood gas, and clinical history. The information derived from the urinary response to the prevailing acid-base disorder is useful to arrive at the correct diagnosis. We discuss the use of urine anion gap, as a surrogate marker of urine ammonium excretion, in the evaluation of a patient with low plasma bicarbonate concentration to differentiate between metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. The interpretation and limitations of urine acid-base indexes at bedside (urine pH, urine bicarbonate, and urine anion gap) to evaluate urine acidification are discussed.

Case presentation

A 14 year old adolescent female, belonging to central India, was diagnosed with B- cell ALL and started on induction phase of chemotherapy with Vincristine (1.5 mg/m 2; once weekly), Prednisolone (60 mg/m 2 /day), Daunomycin (30 mg/m 2; once weekly), intrathecal Methotrexate (12 mg; once weekly) and Non-pegylated L-asparaginase (10,000 IU/m 2; on day 6,9,12,15,18 of induction phase). On the 21st day of the induction phase, patient complained of abdominal pain and breathlessness. Examination revealed tachycardia (150/min), tachypnea (40/min), a low volume, thready pulse and hypotension (BP-80/50 mmHg). She had cold extremities and signs of dehydration.

Investigations showed a blood sugar level of 501 mg/dl. Venous blood gas showed a pH of 7.22, pCO 2 of 15.8 mmHg, HCO 3 ¯ of 10.4 mmol/L, serum sodium of 138 mEq/L, serum potassium of 3.6 mEq/L, serum chloride of 110 mEq/L (Anion gap: 17.6). Urinary ketone bodies were positive (moderate size- 40 mg/dl). Further investigations showed, glycosylated HbA 1 C was 7.95%, serum amylase 479 IU/L and serum lipase 3340 IU/L. Liver enzymes and renal function tests were within normal limits. A sonogram of the abdomen showed bulky pancreas with normal echotexture (Fig. 1). To summarize, our patient had high anion gap metabolic acidosis, ketonuria and elevated levels of HbA 1 C, serum lipase and amylase with bulky pancreas on imaging. Based on above findings, a diagnosis of moderate DKA with acute pancreatitis was made.

### Alcoholic ketoacidosis in an 11-year-old boy [^112AgRs2]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

A history of ethanol consumption combined with vomiting, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and altered mental status is consistent with a broad differential diagnosis, which requires a systematic approach. Alcoholic ketoacidosis is rare after binge drinking in the naïve individual and typically occurs in patients with heavy, chronic use. We present the case of an 11-year-old boy with acute ethanol intoxication and a clinical course that is most consistent with alcoholic ketoacidosis. Alcoholic ketoacidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of children with unexplained ketoacidosis when there is history or evidence of ethanol consumption combined with the appropriate clinical presentation.

### Intermittent hemodialysis as a rewarming strategy for severe hypothermia in patients without renal failure: a case report [^111c3TGp]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Case

A 71-year-old female with obesity was found unconscious outside her home after being exposed to the cold for about 10–12 h, following an evening of drinking alcohol. In the emergency department, patient had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3 (E1V1M1), rectal temperature of 24.5°C, heart rate of 58 beats per minute, blood pressure of 81/51mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with Osborne waves as shown in Fig. 1. Arterial blood gas analysis at 37°C revealed mixed respiratory and anion gap metabolic acidosis, attributed to hypoventilation and lactic acidosis, with high ethanol levels; other toxins were not elevated. Blood tests indicated hypoglycemia, elevated lactate, mild rhabdomyolysis, and significant hypokalemia, as shown in Tables 1 and 2. Serum cortisol levels were not ordered. Imaging excluded acute intracranial issues and fractures.

### Use of anion gap in the evaluation of a patient with metabolic acidosis [^113JDFth]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

High anion gap (AG) metabolic acidosis, a common laboratory abnormality encountered in clinical practice, frequently is due to accumulation of organic acids such as lactic acid, keto acids, alcohol metabolites, and reduced kidney function. The cause of high AG metabolic acidosis often is established easily using historical and simple laboratory data. Despite this, several challenges in the diagnosis and management of high AG metabolic acidosis remain, including quantifying the increase in AG, understanding the relationship between changes in AG and serum bicarbonate level, and identifying the cause of high AG metabolic acidosis when common causes are ruled out. The present case was selected to highlight the importance of the correction of AG for serum albumin level, the use of actual baseline AG rather than mean normal AG, the relationship between changes in serum bicarbonate level and AG, and a systematic diagnostic approach to uncommon causes of high AG metabolic acidosis, such as 5-oxoproline acidosis (pyroglutamic acidosis).

### An unusual case of hyperglycemia, abdominal pain, and increased anion gap acidosis [^117KgwXK]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

In this case report we try to illustrate the importance of correct diagnostic reasoning and the misleading features of point-of-care testing. This case illustrates that even though hyperglycemia, ketonuria, a raised anion gap metabolic acidosis, and acute abdominal pain almost inevitably warrant a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis, other possibilities still exist and need to be excluded. In that light, we emphasize the clinical and therapeutic importance of determining serum lactate and urinary ketones in the differential diagnosis of a raised anion gap metabolic acidosis.

### A 44-year-old woman with metabolic acidosis, high anion gap, and delayed neurologic deterioration [^113RY38h]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

A 44-year-old woman was brought to the ED from John F. Kennedy International Airport. The patient was returning with her son from a 3-month visit to Bangladesh. Her journey started with a 4-h flight from Dhaka, Bangladesh to Dubai, United Arab Emirates. She consumed 240 mL of whiskey during the flight. This was followed by a 14-h flight from Dubai to New York. According to the patient's son, she did not consume any alcohol during the second flight. The patient was in her usual state of health with normal mentation throughout her journey. Upon landing, she started complaining of shortness of breath. After disembarking, she was witnessed to have seizure-like activity with involuntary passage of urine, following which she collapsed. The patient was intubated by emergency medical services in the field.

### Occult metformin toxicity in three patients with profound lactic acidosis [^116TT8RU]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

There are 20.8 million Americans with diabetes, and metformin is the most commonly prescribed oral diabetes agent. A review of our metformin experience highlights common pitfalls that lead to life-threatening or fatal poisonings. We describe 3 patients with metformin toxicity; 2 of 3 patients were prescribed metformin despite end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Case 1: a 40-year-old woman presented after a polysubstance overdose. Within 8 h, vomiting and lethargy developed; a profound acidosis, pH 6.95, pCO(2) 26, pO(2) 195, and elevated serum lactate 21 mmol/L (ref 0.5–1.6 mmol/L) were noted. Further inquiry revealed that the patient had ingested metformin. She was intubated; bicarbonate therapy and hemodialysis were initiated; however, she became hypotensive and died. A metformin level was 150 μg/mL (therapeutic 1–2 μg/mL). Case 2: a 69-year-old woman with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and ESRD presented to the Emergency Department (ED), having missed dialysis. She was sluggish and complained of abdominal pain; an acidosis, pH 7.37, pCO(2) 20, pO(2) 171; anion gap 38, and elevated serum lactate 18.9 mmol/L were noted. Hemodialysis was initiated when it was revealed that she took metformin daily. She improved rapidly and a metformin level was 27.4 μg/mL. Case 3: a 57-year-old woman with a history of NIDDM and ESRD presented with dyspnea. Laboratory studies showed pH 7.03, pCO(2) 21, pO(2) 99; anion gap 36, and lactate 16 mmol/L. Bicarbonate therapy and hemodialysis were initiated after discovering that she had recently been prescribed metformin. She had a fatal cardiac arrest after dialysis was completed. We describe 3 ED patients with occult metformin toxicity diagnosed after laboratory results showed an anion gap metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate levels. All patients had lethargy, vomiting, or abdominal pain, also suggesting sepsis or mesenteric infarction. Despite sodium bicarbonate therapy and hemodialysis, metformin-associated lactic acidosis was fatal in 2 of 3 patients. Emergency Physicians must be vigilant to recognize metformin toxicity in patients at high risk for metformin-associated lactic acidosis.

### Citric acid ingestion: a life-threatening cause of metabolic acidosis [^1112S4hC]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

We present a case that illustrates the acute (< 6 hours) metabolic and hemodynamic effects of the ingestion of a massive oral citric acid load. The principal findings included metabolic acidosis accompanied by an increase in the plasma anion gap that was not caused by L -lactic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and the abrupt onset of hypotension. A unique feature was a dramatic clinical improvement when ionized calcium was infused. The case illustrates the importance of considering the properties of the conjugate base (anion) of the added acid because, in this instance, the citrate anion had a unique and life-threatening consequence (lower ionized calcium level) that was rapidly reversible.

### High anion gap metabolic acidosis… [^111wouAN]. Wikipedia (2008). Low credibility.

High anion gap metabolic acidosis is a form of metabolic acidosis characterized by a high anion gap. Metabolic acidosis occurs when the body produces too much acid, or when the kidneys are not removing enough acid from the body. Several types of metabolic acidosis occur, grouped by their influence on the anion gap. The anion gap can be increased due to relatively low levels of cations other than sodium and potassium. An anion gap is usually considered to be high if it is over 12 mEq/L. High anion gap metabolic acidosis is typically caused by acid produced by the body. More rarely, it may be caused by ingesting methanol or overdosing on aspirin. The delta ratio is a formula that can be used to assess elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis and to evaluate whether mixed acid base disorder is present.

The list of agents that cause high anion gap metabolic acidosis is similar to but broader than the list of agents that cause a serum osmolal gap. Causes The most common causes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis are: ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, kidney failure, and toxic ingestions. Ketoacidosis can occur as a complication of diabetes mellitus, but can occur due to other disorders, such as chronic alcoholism and malnutrition. In these conditions, excessive free fatty acid metabolism results in the production of ketoacids, acetoacetic acid, and beta-hydroxybutyrate. Lactic acidosis results from excess formation and decreased metabolism of lactate, which occurs during states of anaerobic metabolism. It is the most common cause of metabolic acidosis in hospitalized patients. The most serious form occurs during various states of shock, due to episodes of decreased liver perfusion.

Kidney failure results in decreased acid excretion and increased bicarbonate excretion. Toxins that result in acidic metabolites may trigger lactic acidosis. Rhabdomyolysis, a muscle-wasting disease, is a rare cause of metabolic acidosis. Mnemonics Various mnemonics are used to assist clinicians in the detection and diagnosis of conditions that may result in high anion gap metabolic acidosis: The newer 2008 mnemonic "GOLD MARK" was proposed in The Lancet reflecting current causes of anion gap metabolic acidosis:

- G — glycols
- O — oxoproline, a metabolite of paracetamol
- L — L-lactate, the chemical responsible for lactic acidosis
- D — D-lactate
- M — methanol
- A — aspirin.
- R — renal failure
- K — ketoacidosis, ketones generated from starvation, alcohol, and diabetic ketoacidosis The mnemonic MUDPILES is commonly used to remember the causes of increased anion gap metabolic acidosis.
- M — Methanol
- U — Uremia
- D — Diabetic ketoacidosis
- P — Paracetamol, Propylene glycol.
- I — Infection, Iron, Isoniazid, Inborn errors of metabolism
- L — Lactic acidosis
- E — Ethylene glycol.
- S — Salicylates Another frequently used mnemonic is KARMEL.
- K — Ketoacidosis
- A — aspirin
- R — Renal failure
- M — Methanol
- E — Ethylene glycol
- L — Lactic acidosis Yet another frequently used mnemonic is KULT.

### Metabolic alkalosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment: core curriculum 2022 [^113x7FQh]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Diuretic-Induced Metabolic Alkalosis

Inhibitors of Cl − absorption in both the kidney's thick ascending limb and the distal convoluted tubule can generate metabolic alkalosis subsequent to the loss of salt (NaCl) and fluid. Thiazides (inhibitors of the Na + /Cl − cotransporter [NCC]) produce a mild metabolic alkalosis. By contrast, loop diuretics (furosemide and its analogs) can produce severe metabolic alkalosis consequent to the inhibition of NKCC2. The generation of metabolic alkalosis with loop diuretics is due to the combination of several sequential steps. It starts primarily with salt wasting, resulting in volume depletion and activation of the renin-aldosterone system (RAS). Next, the salt wasting increases the delivery of Na + (and Cl −) to the more distal segments, such as the connecting tubule and collecting duct, where Na + will be absorbed via the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in exchange for K + (predominantly via the renal outer medullary K + channel [ROMK]) and H + secretion (via H + -ATPase and in part H + /K + -ATPase) (Fig 4A). These processes are significantly amplified in the presence of aldosterone (Fig 4B), which also has a direct effect on H + secretion in the medullary collecting duct.

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (such as acetazolamide) are used as diuretics in patients with congestive heart failure. In addition, they are also used for the treatment of various disorders including certain types of seizures, glaucoma, mountain sickness, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. They cause HCO 3 − wasting by inhibiting HCO 3 − absorption in the proximal tubule and the collecting duct, resulting in nongap (hyperchloremic) metabolic acidosis. In addition, they also cause K + wasting, which leads to hypokalemia. The patient in case 1 has metabolic alkalosis and not acidosis, so for Question 1, option (a) is not correct. Glucocorticoids at high concentrations, like those in ectopic corticotropin production, can bind and activate the mineralocorticoid receptor in principal cells, leading to the stimulation of salt absorption via ENaC and generation of hypertension. The absorption of Na + will increase K + and H + secretion into the urine, promoting hypokalemia and enhanced HCO 3 − absorption. The presence of hypertension is detected in the majority of patients with ectopic corticotropin secretion. The patient in case 1 presents with low blood pressure and tachycardia suggestive of intravascular volume depletion, so option (b) is not correct.

Among other possible causes, normal anion gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by toluene poisoning, acute diarrhea, posthypocapnic acidosis, chronic kidney disease, hyperkalemic distal renal tubular acidosis, proximal renal tubular acidosis, hypokalemic distal renal tubular acidosis, pancreatic fistula, Addison's disease, ileostomy and complications of ureterosigmoidostomy. In addition, normal anion gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by medications such as acetazolamide and cholestyramine.

### Profound metabolic acidosis and oxoprolinuria in an adult [^113qVTBY]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Profound metabolic acidosis in critically ill adults sometimes remains unexplained despite extensive evaluation.

Case Report

A 58-year-old female presented in a confused state to the emergency department; she had been confused for several days. Laboratory evaluation revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis and modestly elevated acetaminophen level. Lactic acid was only modestly elevated. There was no evidence of ketoacids, salicylate, methanol, or ethylene glycol. A urine sample submitted on day 1 of hospitalization revealed a markedly elevated level of 5-oxoproline.

Discussion

Originally described in children with an inherited defect of glutathione synthetase, 5-oxoproline is an unusual cause of metabolic acidosis. More recently this disturbance has been recognized in critically ill adults without a recognized inherited metabolic disorder. In most of these cases there has been the concomitant use of acetaminophen. Any causal relationship between acetaminophen and this disturbance is speculative.

Conclusion

In critically ill adults with unexplained metabolic acidosis, 5-Oxoproline should be considered in the differential.

### Severe non-anion gap metabolic acidosis induced by topiramate: a case report [^115KX8zZ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

A non-anion gap acidosis can be induced by topiramate, causing symptomatic dyspnea and confusion.

Objectives

Discuss the pathophysiology of the hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis caused by topiramate, the typical clinical presentation, and the recommended treatment.

Case Report

This case presents a young woman with a clinically significant non-anion gap metabolic acidosis believed to be caused by topiramate. She had been taking the medication for several months without prior adverse effects. Once she began having dyspnea as a respiratory response to the renal tubule acidosis, she had decreased oral intake of food and fluids, which induced a pre-renal acute renal failure that worsened her acidemia. In the Emergency Department, she received intravenous fluids and sodium bicarbonate, and later was intubated for mechanical ventilation due to respiratory fatigue. With the topiramate withdrawn, the patient had a full recovery of her renal function and metabolic acid-base status over the next 72 h. This case serves to increase awareness of this possible adverse effect and the recommended treatment as topiramate becomes more widely used.

Conclusions

Topiramate can induce a renal tubule acidosis resulting in a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Recognition of the underlying cause is crucial so that the drug can be withdrawn while supportive care is provided.

### Acquired pyroglutamic acidosis due to long-term dicloxacillin and paracetamol use [^115m36dC]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Background

High anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) is a commonly encountered acid-base disturbance in patients in the hospital setting and is generally attributable to ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, renal failure or ingestion of toxic substances (eg, salicylates, glycols and methanol).

Accumulation of pyroglutamic acidosis (PGA) (5-oxoproline) is a less commonly identified aetiology. This can occur in children with inborn errors of metabolism affecting enzymes in the γ-glutamyl cycle (eg, glutathione synthase deficiency), which produces the antioxidant glutathione, or it can be acquired. Acquired PGA occurs in association with glutathione and cysteine depletion, or as an adverse effect of certain medications (eg, flucloxacillin and paracetamol).

Complications due to drug interactions in patients with hepatic and renal dysfunction can be difficult to identify, and unmanaged metabolic acidosis can contribute significantly to mortality. Given the common utilisation of paracetamol and penicillins, PGA may be an under-reported issue.

We report a case of an 85-year-old man with a complex medical history, who developed a multi-factorial HAGMA.

### A patient presenting with metabolic acidosis despite severe vomiting – correct diagnosis by use of the physical-chemical approach [^111whNWu]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

We describe the case of a 28-year-old otherwise healthy woman who presents to our emergency department with nausea for 2 days and severe vomiting for 1 day. She has no history of travel, and her medical history is unremarkable. The physical examination shows a soft and nontender abdomen. Laboratory examinations reveal the presence of significant metabolic alkalosis despite the severe vomiting of the patient. Hypochloremic alkalosis would be expected to be present in this patient. We explain how to correctly identify the rare cause of metabolic acidosis present in this patient using the physicochemical approach (Stewarts approach) for the analysis of human acid-base disorders.

### Metabolic acidosis of CKD: diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and treatment [^1128dyGX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is noted in the majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) when glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreases to less than 20% to 25% of normal, although as many as 20% of individuals can have acid-base parameters close to or within the normal range. Acidosis generally is mild to moderate in degree, with plasma bicarbonate concentrations ranging from 12 to 22 mEq/L (mmol/L), and it is rare to see values less than 12 mEq/L (mmol/L) in the absence of an increased acid load. Degree of acidosis approximately correlates with severity of renal failure and usually is more severe at a lower GFR. The metabolic acidosis can be of the high-anion-gap variety, although anion gap can be normal or only moderately increased even with stage 4 to 5 CKD. Several adverse consequences have been associated with metabolic acidosis, including muscle wasting, bone disease, impaired growth, abnormalities in growth hormone and thyroid hormone secretion, impaired insulin sensitivity, progression of renal failure, and exacerbation of beta 2 -microglobulin accumulation. Administration of base aimed at normalization of plasma bicarbonate concentration might be associated with certain complications, such as volume overload, exacerbation of hypertension, and facilitation of vascular calcifications. Whether normalization of plasma bicarbonate concentrations in all patients is desirable therefore requires additional study. In the present review, we describe clinical and laboratory characteristics of metabolic acidosis, discuss potential adverse effects, and address benefits and complications of therapy.

### Metabolic alkalosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment: core curriculum 2022 [^114bcob6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

The patient in case 3 exhibits signs of volume depletion, along with hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. In addition, she displays inability to conserve chloride. Common causes of volume contraction with metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia include vomiting, excessive use of loop or thiazide diuretics, or an inordinate consumption of laxatives. It can also be caused by genetic disorders such as congenital chloride-losing diarrhea, Gitelman syndrome, or Bartter syndrome. This patient does not fit into any of these categories. Loss of electrolytes in sweat, specifically in hot weather, can lead to significant volume depletion and RAAS activation, leading to hypokalemia and alkalosis. The urine chloride in nonrenal causes of volume depletion and metabolic alkalosis should be very low. However, the urine chloride in this patient is elevated, meaning option (a) is not correct for Question 6.

Salt wasting due to excessive consumption of electrolyte-containing solutions should not lead to volume depletion and metabolic alkalosis, so option (b) is not correct. This patient's history did not support the presence of respiratory acidosis before or on admission, and she was not treated for it before the admission to the hospital, ruling out option (c).

Recent studies have identified kidney-specific mechanisms that contribute to the generation of metabolic alkalosis in the setting of volume contraction. These reports demonstrated that pendrin, which is critical to Cl − absorption (and HCO 3 − secretion) by B-intercalated cells in volume-depleted states, is profoundly downregulated in cystic fibrosis. a Pendrin downregulation impairs the ability of the kidney collecting duct to absorb salt and enhance HCO 3 − secretion (Fig 1). This further exacerbates the magnitude of volume contraction and metabolic alkalosis due to renal Cl − loss and impaired HCO 3 − secretion into the collecting duct, respectively. The loss of Cl − in the urine consequent to the inactivation of pendrin in the setting of volume depletion mimics a pseudo-Bartter picture, which has been described in cystic fibrosis patients, thus option (d) is the best answer to Question 6. The patient was admitted for the evaluation and treatment of hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with volume contraction, and received 6 liters of saline along with 120 mEq of KCl over 48 hours. She was discharged with a serum HCO 3 − of 27 and K + of 3.8 mEq/L, and a venous blood gas of 7.41.

### Severe metabolic alkalosis due to the combination of unmeasured cations and hypochloraemia in a patient with gastroparesia and frequent emesis [^1162Fyh9]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

This report describes a patient with gastroparesia and frequent emesis admitted with severe metabolic alkalaemia, hyperlactataemia and acute renal failure. Metabolic alkalaemia was not only due to hypochloraemia but also due to unmeasured cations. These cations were found to be present by calculating anion gap and strong ion gap (both were negative, which is rare). After massive gastric bleeding the patient had a cardiac arrest; following cardiopulmonary resuscitation and infusion of a large volume of normal saline, new blood tests revealed improvement in chloraemia but also a significant increase in the anion gap, suggesting that unmeasured anions rapidly overcame unmeasured cations. The patient died after sequential episodes of cardiac arrest. Anion gap and strong ion gap were useful in the diagnosis of this "hidden" unusual cause of metabolic alkalosis and also in the diagnosis of metabolic acidosis after cardiac arrest, even with normal/high values of base excess and bicarbonate.

### A rare cause of metabolic acidosis: fatal transdermal methanol intoxication in an infant [^112e4WNX]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

Oral methanol intoxication is common, but dermal intoxication is rare. We report a previously healthy 19-month-old female infant admitted to the emergency department (ED) with vomiting and tonic-clonic seizure. On physical examination, she was comatose and presented signs of decompensated shock with Kussmaul breathing. Her left thigh was edematous, with purple coloration. Methanol intoxication was suspected due to high anion gap metabolic acidosis (pH, 6.89; HCO3, < 3 meq/L) and exposure to spirit-soaked bandages (%96 methanol) for 24 hours and 3 days. The patient's serum methanol level was 20.4 mg/dL. She was treated with fomepizole and continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) in the pediatric intensive care unit, and methanol levels decreased to 0 mg/dL after 12 hours. During follow-up, massive edema and subarachnoid hemorrhage in the occipital lobe were detected by computed tomography of the brain. The patient died after 7 days. Although methanol intoxication occurs predominantly in adults, it must be considered in children with high-anion gap metabolic acidosis. This case report demonstrates that fatal transdermal methanol intoxication can occur in children, and it is the second report in the English literature of transdermal methanol intoxication in an infant.

### Distal renal tubular acidosis presenting with an acute hypokalemic paralysis in an older child with severe vesicoureteral reflux and syringomyelia: a case report [^113UxCPg]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our patient was hospitalized after her first episode of acute hypokalemic paralysis. Based on her history and physical examination, we concluded that she had a lower motor neuron type paralysis originating from the muscles along with hypokalemia (K 2.4 mEq/L), suggesting an acute hypokalemic paralysis. The possible cause of hypokalemia was investigated, primarily the possibility of potassium loss from the kidneys. The occurrence of hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis suggests the possibility of a gastrointestinal loss of bicarbonate or RTA. In this case, RTA was considered the possible cause due to the patient's obstructive uropathy and the absence of gastrointestinal loss. All forms of RTA induce normal anion gap (hyperchloremic) metabolic acidosis, but the hallmark of dRTA is impaired urine acidification. The findings of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, a normal anion gap, a positive UAG, a UOG of < 150 mOsmol/kg, and a high urine acidity (pH > 5.5) support the diagnosis of dRTA. Urine anion gap and UOG are indirect markers of urine acidification that estimate urinary ammonium (NH 4 +), which represents a major portion of net acid excretion (NAE). The urine acidification impairment in dRTA and CKD patients is associated with positive UAG and a decrease in UOG, with both markers are well correlated with urine NH 4 + and NAE. However, UOG provides a better estimation of urinary NH 4 + excretion than UAG in RTA, due to the latter becoming a less reliable predictor of urinary NH 4 + excretion in patients with acute or chronic kidney disease.

### Review of clinical disorders causing metabolic acidosis [^1164Bq47]. Advances in Chronic Kidney Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Among other possible causes, high anion gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by metformin-induced lactic acidosis, toluene poisoning, acetaminophen overdose, alcoholic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, diabetic ketoacidosis, aspirin overdose, propylene glycol poisoning, ethylene glycol poisoning, starvation ketosis, multiple myeloma, maple syrup urine disease, lactic acidosis, methanol poisoning, sepsis, uremia, rhabdomyolysis, cyanide poisoning, isopropyl alcohol poisoning and pyroglutamic acidosis. In addition, high anion gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by medications such as aspirin.

### Lactation ketoacidosis: case presentation and literature review [^111ggN3K]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A 35-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 2days history of malaise and headache. She was breastfeeding her 5-month old infant and had recently started an altered diet based on reducing carbohydrate amount. Moreover, she had also started exercising 2weeks prior to her illness. Initial blood tests revealed high anion gap metabolic acidosis and hypoglycaemia (pH 7.13 (normal 7.30–7.40), bicarbonate 9.4mmol/L (normal 21.0–28.0), anion gap 22.6mmol/L (normal 8–12), glucose 2.9mmol/L (normal fasting 3.9–5.8) and ketones 6.4mmol/L (normal < 0.6)). The patient was treated with intravenous dextrose and showed complete resolution of ketoacidosis and hypoglycaemia within 48hours. She was discharged home and remained well with a balanced diet. After excluding all other the causes of hypoglycaemia and ketoacidosis, the diagnosis of lactation ketoacidosis was made and it was considered triggered by altered diet, exercise and skipping meals. All 11 cases of lactation ketoacidosis which has previously been published are reviewed as well.

### A patient with alcoholic ketoacidosis and profound lactemia [^115ZZEPS]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) is a complex syndrome that results from disrupted metabolism in the setting of excessive alcohol use and poor oral intake. Dehydration, glycogen depletion, high redox state, and release of stress hormones are the primary factors producing the characteristic anion gap metabolic acidosis with an elevated β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OH) and lactate.

Case Report

We present the case of a 47-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with metabolic acidosis and profoundly elevated lactate levels who had AKA. He recovered completely with intravenous fluids and parenteral glucose administration. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians should always consider the immediately life-threatening causes of a severe anion gap metabolic acidosis and treat aggressively based on the situation. This case highlights the fact that AKA can present with an impressively elevated lactate levels. Emergency physicians should keep AKA in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with a similar clinical picture.

### Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis due to deferasirox in a patient with beta thalassemia major [^111L3yMy]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis in a patient with beta thalassemia major secondary to treatment with deferasirox due to iron overload.

Case Summary

A 58-year-old white female with beta thalassemia major was admitted with fever, fatigue, abnormal liver function test results, and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (lactate dehydrogenase 494 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 167 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 250 U/L, gamma-glutamyl transferase 102 U/L, total bilirubin 3.79 mg/dL, direct bilrubin 2.37, potassium 3.3 mEq/L, PO(2) 81.4 mm Hg, PCO(2) 29.4 mm Hg, HCO(3) 16 mEq/L, pH 7.35, chloride 116 mEq/L, anion gap 7.5 mEq/L). Twenty-five days before admission the patient decided to discontinue treatment with deferoxamine for chronic iron overload and continue treatment with oral deferasirox 1500 mg/day. Despite extended clinical and laboratory examination, no obvious cause of fever, hepatitis, or hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis was revealed. Diagnosis was compatible with tubular dysfunction, drug-induced hepatitis, and hypersensitivity reaction due to deferasirox. All pathological findings were fully reversible and our patient had an excellent outcome.

Discussion

The presence of tubular dysfunction should be considered in any patient with otherwise unexplained hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. In our patient, other potential causes of metabolic hyperchloremic acidosis were ruled out. Toxic effects of deferasirox are probably caused by chelation of mitochondrial iron, leading to adenosine triphosphate depletion in tubular epithelial cells. Use of the Naranjo probability scale revealed that the adverse reaction was probable.

Conclusions

Kidney toxicity may be a major issue in the management of patients receiving deferasirox. Our case indicates a potential risk of renal toxicity with the presence of tubular dysfunction and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis in patients undergoing treatment with deferasirox.

### Metabolic alkalosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment: core curriculum 2022 [^111s7rzo]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Case 3:

A 28-year-old woman with cystic fibrosis has been followed up in the adult outpatient clinic for the past 12 years. Last year she was admitted to the hospital with severe weakness and lethargy after an episode of upset stomach associated with nausea and loss of appetite. There was no vomiting or diarrhea. Her vital signs on admission showed a blood pressure of 90/55 mm Hg and pulse rate of 90 beats/min. Blood chemical analysis showed Na +, 134 mEq/L; K +, 2.4 mEq/L; HCO 3 −, 35 mEq/L; Cl −, 88 mEq/L; SUN, 38 mg/dL; and Scr, 1.4 mg/dL. She is not on any diuretics. VBG indicated a pH of 7.48 and P 2 of 48 mm Hg. Urine electrolyte profile showed Na +, 35 mEq/L; Cl −, 30 mEq/L; and K +, 28 mEq/L.

Question 6:
The generation of metabolic alkalosis, volume depletion, and renal Cl − loss in this patient could be best explained by:

Severe volume depletion due to the excessive loss of Na + and Cl − in sweat
Kidney salt wasting due to excessive consumption of electrolyte replacement solutions
Posthypercapnic metabolic alkalosis after the treatment for respiratory acidosis
The inability to conserve Cl − in the kidney during volume depletion

For the answer to the question, see the following text.

Chloride-Responsive Alkalosis

The treatment of metabolic alkalosis with volume contraction (urine Cl − < 20 mmol/L) targets the factors that maintain the alkalotic state: decreased GFR due to volume depletion, Cl − deficiency, and hypokalemia. Administration of Cl − -based intravenous fluids expands intravascular volume, restores GFR, and disrupts the avid reabsorption of Na +, K +, HCO 3 −, Cl −, and water, as well as facilitating HCO 3 − excretion. Rising urinary Cl − indicates adequate volume expansion. Repletion of K + to address hypokalemia decreases ammoniagenesis and the generation of new HCO 3 − as well as reducing the absorption of HCO 3 −. Restoring K + reestablishes pendrin expression and activity, thereby enhancing the secretion of HCO 3 −. Altogether, this treatment with Cl − -based intravenous fluid and K + repletion corrects multiple pathogenic factors that maintain volume-depleted metabolic alkalosis.

### Circulating anions usually associated with the krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis [^114yzvp4]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute metabolic acidosis of non-renal origin is usually a result of either lactic or ketoacidosis, both of which are associated with a high anion gap. There is increasing recognition, however, of a group of acidotic patients who have a large anion gap that is not explained by either keto- or lactic acidosis nor, in most cases, is inappropriate fluid resuscitation or ingestion of exogenous agents the cause.

Methods

Plasma ultrafiltrate from patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, acidosis of unknown cause, normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, or acidosis as a result of base loss were examined enzymatically for the presence of low molecular weight anions including citrate, isocitrate, α-ketoglutarate, succinate, malate and d-lactate. The results obtained from the study groups were compared with those obtained from control plasma from normal volunteers.

Results

In five patients with lactic acidosis, a significant increase in isocitrate (0.71 ± 0.35 mEq l -1), α-ketoglutarate (0.55 ± 0.35 mEq l -1), malate (0.59 ± 0.27 mEq l -1), and d-lactate (0.40 ± 0.51 mEq l -1) was observed. In 13 patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, significant increases in isocitrate (0.42 ± 0.35 mEq l -1), α-ketoglutarate (0.41 ± 0.16 mEq l -1), malate (0.23 ± 0.18 mEq l -1) and d-lactate (0.16 ± 0.07 mEq l -1) were seen. Neither citrate nor succinate levels were increased. Similar findings were also observed in a further five patients with high anion gap acidosis of unknown origin with increases in isocitrate (0.95 ± 0.88 mEq l -1), α-ketoglutarate (0.65 ± 0.20 mEq l -1), succinate (0.34 ± 0.13 mEq l -1), malate (0.49 ± 0.19 mEq l -1) and d-lactate (0.18 ± 0.14 mEq l -1) being observed but not in citrate concentration. In five patients with a normal anion gap acidosis, no increases were observed except a modest rise in d-lactate (0.17 ± 0.14 mEq l -1).

Conclusion

The levels of certain low molecular weight anions usually associated with intermediary metabolism were found to be significantly elevated in the plasma ultrafiltrate obtained from patients with metabolic acidosis. Our results suggest that these hitherto unmeasured anions may significantly contribute to the generation of the anion gap in patients with lactic acidosis and acidosis of unknown aetiology and may be underestimated in diabetic ketoacidosis. These anions are not significantly elevated in patients with normal anion gap acidosis.

### Falsely normal anion gap in severe salicylate poisoning caused by laboratory interference [^112V6Cur]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Severe salicylate poisoning is classically associated with an anion gap metabolic acidosis. However, high serum salicylate levels can cause false increase of laboratory chloride results on some analyzers. We present 2 cases of life-threatening salicylate poisoning with an apparently normal anion gap caused by an important laboratory interference. These cases highlight that the diagnosis of severe salicylism must be considered in all patients presenting with metabolic acidosis, even in the absence of an increased anion gap.

Discussion

The patient presented with severe anion gap metabolic acidosis, anion gap of 41 mmol/L (Na + − Cl − − HCO 3 −) and an albumin-corrected anion gap of 40 mmol/L [anion gap − 2.5 × (4 − albumin)]. This patient's high anion gap metabolic acidosis is likely primarily caused by DKA, with some contribution from the DKA-associated secondary lactic acidosis and volume depletion-induced pre-renal uremic acidosis.

Using Winter's formula [pCO 2 = (1.5 × HCO 3 −) + 8 ± 2], we calculated the respiratory compensation to yield an expected pCO 2 between 15.6 and 19.6 mmHg. ABG revealed a pCO 2 of 16 mmHg, suggesting she had a primary metabolic acidosis with adequate respiratory compensation.

The delta gap was used to investigate the presence of a mixed metabolic acid–base disorder. The normal range of delta gap is from − 6 to + 6. If the delta gap is significantly positive (> + 6), a concomitant primary metabolic alkalosis is usually present; conversely, if the delta gap is significantly negative (< − 6), then a superimposed non-anion gap metabolic acidosis is usually present. In our case, the delta gap [(adjusted anion gap − 12) − (24 − HCO 3 −)] of + 9 mmol/L indicated there was a co-existing primary metabolic alkalosis.

Meanwhile, the calculated effective osmolality (2 × Na + glucose/18) was 322 mOsm/kg; thus, the patient also had HHS.

The underlying mechanism for the co-existing primary metabolic alkalosis and HHS is likely due to severe hyperglycemia-related glycosuria as well as ketoacidosis-associated osmotic diuresis causing volume depletion. In addition, her nausea, vomiting, and poor oral tolerance worsened her dehydration, thereby causing a contraction alkalosis and the development of hyperosmolarity.

### An unusual cause of metabolic alkalosis: hiding in plain sight [^114BPZGW]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

An 80-year-old woman with a past medical history of long-standing hypertension leading to chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage G3bA1 (baseline serum creatinine 1.4–1.78 mg/dL [123.7–157.35 umol/L], eGFR 33–45 mL/min), hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation and gastroesophageal reflux disease was referred to the Nephrology clinic by her primary care provider for evaluation of chronic metabolic alkalosis.

During her initial clinic visit, the patient endorsed decreased appetite and poor oral intake with resultant 5-pound weight loss over the course of 6 weeks. She denied any nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Her home medications included metoprolol tartrate 50 mg twice daily, pravastatin 10 mg daily, pantoprazole 40 mg daily, rivaroxaban 15 mg daily, and calcium carbonate 600 mg daily. She specifically denied taking any additional medications, either prescribed or over-the-counter. On physical examination, the patient had a BMI of 17.2 kg/m 2, blood pressure of 160/80 mmHg and heart rate of 80 beats per minute. She was clinically euvolemic on exam, particularly, there was no peripheral edema. Table 1 summarizes the patient's initial serum laboratory findings. Notably, her serum bicarbonate was elevated to 44 mmol/L, urinalysis was unremarkable, with no proteinuria or active urine sediment, and urine pH of 6.0, which was somewhat lower than expected for her degree of metabolic alkalosis. Based on the arterial blood gas result with a pH of 7,50, CO2 53 mmHg (7.06 kPa) and bicarbonate 41 mEq/L, the patient was diagnosed with a primary compensated metabolic alkalosis. Spot urine electrolytes revealed the following: urine sodium of 41 mmol/L (fractional excretion of 0.3%), potassium 13.0 mmol/L (fractional excretion 3.87%) and chloride 48 mmol/L (fractional excretion of 0.5%), with a urine creatinine of 128 mg/dL (11,317 umol/L). Her random urine chloride level greater than 20 mmol/L was indicative of a predominantly chloride-resistant metabolic alkalosis. In the setting of the patient's hypertension associated with metabolic alkalosis and tendency to hypokalemia, further workup was obtained after her serum potassium level was repleted to 3.8 mEq/L, to rule out secondary causes of hypertension. Laboratory workup showed a serum renin level of 0.2 ng/mL/h (reference: 0.25–5.82 ng/mL) with normal serum aldosterone level of 3.6 ng/dL supine (Ref: if supine 3–16 ng/dl, upright less or equal to 28 ng/dl) and AM cortisol level of 13.4 mcg/dL (Ref at 7–9 am: 4.6–23.4 mcg/dL). A computed tomography scan of her abdomen was obtained and showed normal-appearing adrenal glands. Further, renal vascular ultrasound was unremarkable with no evidence of renal artery stenosis.

Case presentation

Patient 1

A 49-year-old female from Nochchiyagama (Fig. 1) was admitted with progressive weakness of all four limbs for 3 days. This was her fourth admission with paralysis of limbs during last 2 years. Her past medical records revealed recurrent admissions with hypokalemia and evidence of distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) at her initial presentation in 1995 (Table 1). She was on potassium chloride tablets and potassium citrate solution with very poor compliance. In 2014 she developed a right upper femoral fracture following a minor trauma, which was corrected by a dynamic hip screw.

Survival after extreme arterial acidosis is uncommon. A case of metformin induced lactic acidosis is described where the presenting pH was 6.38 exacerbated by hypothermia (29 degrees C). Increased anion gap acidosis, its varied aetiology, potential reversibility, and the role of hypothermia are discussed. Early liaison with a medical toxicology unit is recommended when this rare condition is suspected.

Patient 6

A 50-year-old female from Padaviya (Fig. 1) with past history of periodic paralysis due to hypokalemia and hypothyroidism, presented with weakness of lower limbs and widespread myalgia. She was on thyroxin, but not on potassium tablets. There was no significant family history. She had generalized muscle weakness but her tendon reflexes, plantar responses and sensory examination were normal. Except for grade two multi nodular goiter remainder of the examination was unremarkable. Investigations revealed hypokalemia (serum potassium 2.4 mmol/L), compensated metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap and alkaline urine indicating RTA (Table 1). She had marginally low serum calcium, normal phosphate and high alkaline phosphatase suggestive of osteomalacia, but her x-rays were normal. Her haemoglobin was normal and blood picture was compatible with SAO.

Management

All were advised on the need for long-term treatment to minimize nephrocalcinosis and MBD associated with dRTA. They were started on oral sodium bicarbonate1–2 meq/kg/day aiming at serum bicarbonate 22 to 24 meq/L. Patients who were intolerant to or showed inadequate response to sodium bicarbonate were given potassium citrate. All are being regularly followed up in outpatient medical clinic.

### Plasma exchange successfully treats central pontine myelinolysis after acute hypernatremia from intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy [^117SnmZ1]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Figure 2
MRI of the brain revealed symmetric, high-intensity signal in the pons with sparing of the peripheral portion, suggesting central pontine myelinolysis (A, axial view and B, sagittal view).

After the patient was stabilized, we were able to work her up to explore the primary cause of her presenting symptoms. We suspected distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) due to the normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, a serum bicarbonate level < 10, hypokalemia, and urine pH of 6.5 (> 5.5), and due to the presence of a calyceal stone in her left kidney. We performed a sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) loading test to confirm distal RTA. In NaHCO 3 loading test, 8.4% NaHCO 3 solution was infused intravenously at a rate of 57 mEq/hour (1 mEq/kg/hour). Urine and blood samples were taken at 1-hour intervals and urine and blood PCO 2 were measured using a blood gas analyzer. When the urine pH was raised to 7.6, urine PCO 2, blood PCO 2, urine HCO 3, blood HCO 3, urine creatinine and serum creatinine were 44.5 mmHg, 34.8 mmHg, 40.1 mEq/L, 25.8 mEq/L, 64.5 mg/dL, and 0.7 mg/dL, respectively. The results of NaHCO 3 loading test revealed a fractionated excretion of HCO 3 of 1.68% and the urine-to-blood carbon dioxide tension gradient (U-B PCO 2) of 9.7, suggesting distal RTA. In addition to the distal RTA, we also found that she had Sjögren's syndrome after the results of Schirmer's test and after she screened positive for anti-Lo and anti-Ra, which was confirmed by a salivary scan and lower lip biopsy. She was discharged and treated at an outpatient clinic with oral sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride. After one year of follow-up, her neurological symptoms were improved, but mild diplopia remained.

### Approach to patients with high anion gap metabolic acidosis: core curriculum 2021 [^115oS1GG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The anion gap (AG) is a mathematical construct that compares the blood sodium concentration with the sum of the chloride and bicarbonate concentrations. It is a helpful calculation that divides the metabolic acidoses into 2 categories: high AG metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis-and thereby delimits the potential etiologies of the disorder. When the [AG] is compared with changes in the bicarbonate concentration, other occult acid-base disorders can be identified. Furthermore, finding that the AG is very small or negative can suggest several occult clinical disorders or raise the possibility of electrolyte measurement artifacts. In this installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we discuss cases that represent several very common and several rare causes of HAGMA. These case scenarios highlight how the AG can provide vital clues that direct the clinician toward the correct diagnosis. We also show how to calculate and, if necessary, correct the AG for hypoalbuminemia and severe hyperglycemia. Plasma osmolality and osmolal gap calculations are described and when used together with the AG guide appropriate clinical decision making.

### Pseudohypobicarbonatemia caused by an endogenous assay interferent: a new entity [^115rZ8ob]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Serum total carbon dioxide, measured using a chemistry analyzer, and gas panel-derived plasma bicarbonate, calculated from the pH and partial pressure of carbon dioxide, often are used interchangeably for clinical purposes. When they disagree, there is a tendency to accept total carbon dioxide and discredit gas panel-derived plasma bicarbonate values. We report a patient who, during a 5-month hospitalization, had persistently low total carbon dioxide levels (12.4 ± 2.7 [standard deviation] mEq/L [12.4 ± 2.7 mmol/L]), measured using an enzymatic/photometric assay, and a high anion gap (19.2 ± 3.1 mEq/L [19.2 ± 3.1 mmol/L]), suggesting high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis, but who had gas panel-derived plasma bicarbonate (24.0 ± 0.9 mEq/L [24.0 ± 0.9 mmol/L]) and arterial pH values in the reference range. Organic anion levels in blood and urine were unremarkable. Negative interference with the enzymatic assay by the patient's serum was shown by the findings that total carbon dioxide level was 7.0 ± 0.1 mEq/L (7.0 ± 0.1 mmol/L) higher when measured using the electrode-based method than using the enzymatic method (P < 0.01), and the patient's serum, but not control serum, altered the reaction kinetics of the enzymatic assay by producing turbidity, resulting in an initial increase in absorbance and a falsely low total carbon dioxide value. The turbidity may have resulted from precipitation of 1 of 2 paraproteins in the patient's serum or an endogenous antibody binding with an animal protein included in the assay reagents. In summary, a discrepancy between total carbon dioxide level measured using an enzymatic assay and gas panel-derived plasma bicarbonate level was found to be the result of turbidity caused by an endogenous interferent with the total carbon dioxide assay, a novel artifact. When total carbon dioxide and gas panel-derived plasma bicarbonate values disagree, measurement error in total carbon dioxide level should be considered.

### Severe multifactorial metabolic alkalosis in the emergency department: a case report [^114x95Ni]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Metabolic alkalosis is an uncommon clinical entity resulting from a wide variety of underlying etiologies including gastrointestinal, renal, endocrine, and metabolic causes. It is a typically clinically silent condition; however, severe cases can be life-threatening, mandating both a systematic investigative approach and an early aggressive management strategy.

Case Report

We present a case of a 58-year-old man with severe, multifactorial metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.72, HCO 3–42 mmol/L, pCO 2 31 mm Hg) resulting from refractory vomiting, severe hypokalemia (2.0 mmol/L), and hypoalbuminemia (albumin 20 g/L). WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Severe metabolic alkalosis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Clinicians need to be aware of the potential underlying causes in these cases, as well as how to delineate between chloride- and non-chloride-depleted states, which dictates initial treatment. We provide a pragmatic summary of the evaluation, pertinent investigations, and early management of these cases.

### Metabolic acidosis in prometryn (triazine herbicide) self-poisoning [^113bhnUN]. Clinical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Prometryn is a triazine herbicide, which is one of the most extensively used groups of herbicides. The mechanism of acute triazine herbicide toxicity in humans is not known. We report a first case of acute prometryn poisoning.

Case Report

A 62-year-old male ingested 50 g of prometryn and ethanol in a suicide attempt. On arrival two hours after ingestion, he was somnolent and vomited. Seven hours after ingestion laboratory tests showed metabolic acidosis with a calculated anion gap of 47.5 mmol/L and lactate of 23.4 mmol/L. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed serum prometryn concentrations of 48.1 mg/L. Hemodialysis corrected metabolic acidosis, but the serum prometryn concentration increased to 67.7 mg/L. The lactate level after hemodialysis was 11.7 mmol/L and returned within normal limits 47 hours after ingestion. The patient was discharged without any sequelae after psychiatric evaluation.

Conclusion

In high anion gap metabolic acidosis we should consider poisoning with prometryn and other triazine herbicides. Hemodialysis corrects metabolic derangements, but it does not lower serum prometryn concentration.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis caused by alcoholic pancreatitis and starvation ketosis [^112UNHfj]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Starvation ketosis and pancreatitis are uncommon and underrecognized etiologies of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Euglycemic DKA is associated commonly with pregnancy, use of insulin en route to the hospital, and use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors. A 58-year-old male with past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus and alcoholism presented with chief complaint of nausea, vomiting, and poor oral intake for several weeks. Despite extensive history of diabetes and no recent SGLT-2 inhibitor use, his labs were consistent with euglycemic DKA. His imaging and clinical history also confirmed alcoholic pancreatitis. The patient was admitted for euglycemic DKA secondary to starvation ketosis and alcoholic pancreatitis. His anion gap and beta-hydroxybutyrate rapidly cleared with initiation of the DKA protocol. This case teaches us that clinicians should consider early initiation of the DKA protocol even in the setting of euglycemia, when a patient presents with high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis, a high beta-hydroxybutyrate level, and a clinical picture of pancreatitis and starvation.

### Metabolic alkalosis [^115h2Xfw]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Metabolic alkalosis is one of the four cardinal acid-base disorders and perhaps the least well understood by students. Taking a mechanistic approach to etiologies and management can be very helpful in such cases. Particularly, one should focus on the factors that generate the alkalosis (source of fluid loss and composition, less commonly alkali administration) and the factors (extracellular fluid volume status, hormonal systems) that maintain the abnormality.

### Mixed acid-base disturbances: core curriculum 2025 [^112AErMb]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Mixed acid-base disorders are frequently encountered in clinical practice and due to their complexity, diagnoses and treatment are challenging. The opposing effects of multiple disturbances can lead to blood pH levels that are near normal or separate acid-base disturbances can have an additive effect leading to more significant changes in blood and intracellular pH. A systematic evaluation of patient history, physical examination, and laboratory results (including acid-base balance, anion gap, electrolytes, and urine parameters) enables the rapid diagnosis of mixed acid-base disorders by analyzing the appropriateness of compensatory mechanisms, assessing changes in serum and urine electrolytes, and estimating urinary acid excretion. Eight cases are provided to illustrate the approach to mixed acid-base disturbances. Examples include mixed metabolic and respiratory acid-base disorders, mixed respiratory acid-base disorders, and mixed metabolic acid-base disorders.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — metabolic abnormalities and mitochondrial evaluation: During vomiting episodes, mild mitochondrial dysfunction is suggested by anion gap metabolic acidosis that "is often 15–20 mg/dL", lactic acidosis, urinary ketosis early in the episode, and/or hypoglycemia, and these findings "by themselves do not necessitate a comprehensive metabolic workup". When present, early testing with quantitative urine organic acids and plasma amino acids "can confirm mild mitochondrial dysfunction" by elevated urine ketones, Krebs cycle intermediates, and/or dicarboxylic acids, while "urine organic acids are typically normal" when asymptomatic or after several hours of intravenous dextrose. In some cases, episodes may reflect mitochondrial disease with severe anion gap metabolic acidosis " > 20 mg/dL", insulin resistance, and/or multisystem failure such as cardiomyopathy or seizures.

We have shown that the concentration of anions normally associated with the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle are elevated in appreciable quantities in patients with a metabolic acidosis. We propose that they may play a significant role in generating the anion gap. Further work in this laboratory is currently underway to explore the clinical implications of these findings.

5.1 Lactic Acidosis

Metformin

Lactic acidosis is a serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with JENTADUETO and is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels of > 5 µg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin is approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, (with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal impairment, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia due to unstable or acute failure, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in any patient unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic impairment. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake when taking metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure necessitating restricted intake of food or fluids. Use of topiramate, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, in epilepsy and migraine prophylaxis may cause dose-dependent metabolic acidosis and may exacerbate the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Case files of the California poison control system, San Francisco division: blue thunder ingestion: methanol, nitromethane, and elevated creatinine [^114FWGes]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Although metabolic acidosis is a characteristic feature of methanol poisoning, its onset may be delayed for 18–24 h, or even longer (up to 72 h) with concurrent ethanol ingestion, due to competition for the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase. Thus, the patient may be relatively asymptomatic during the latent period. Our patient had no measurable ethanol level, yet his acidosis was very mild with an anion gap of only 17 mmol/L and a bicarbonate level of 21 mmol/L. A significant anion gap may not be present early in the course of methanol intoxication. In a review of 113 acute methanol exposures reported to a poison center, metabolic acidosis was reported in only 26 cases (23%). Therefore, the absence of acidosis does not rule out methanol ingestion.

Possible reasons for our patient not developing worsening or severe acidosis may include an inaccurate history of ingestion. He might have ingested only a small amount of methanol, or ingested it shortly before being found. He may also have co-ingested ethanol or other types of alcohols that are metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase, such that the metabolism of methanol to formate was blocked. Such other alcohols might include ethylene glycol or isopropanol. However, ethanol was not detected and there was no nail polish remover-like odor detected in the patient, which would be present when isopropyl alcohol is metabolized to acetone. There was improvement in our patient's anion-gap acidosis simply with hydration, which also argues against ethylene glycol and methanol ingestions.

Thus, even though our patient currently appears relatively well, it is possible that he ingested methanol. It would be prudent to manage him as for methanol ingestion, given the history of ingestion and the very large osmolal gap. Nevertheless, it is unusual that our patient's anion gap and acidosis improved in the short duration of supportive management with intravenous fluids alone.

### Metformin associated lactic acidosis: a case series of 28 patients treated with sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) and long-term follow-up [^113qP53B]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

The death events occurred during the first hemodialytic treatment (after a mean of 3:15 h of treatment, around 5 h since admission) or soon after (two patients died 24 h since admission and one patient after 22 h). Patients had very similar clinical presentations, commonly with moderate to severe dehydration associated with vomiting, diarrhea and oliguria. Upon admission to our Division, blood gases often showed high levels of venous pO2, most likely because of hyperventilation secondary to severe acidosis and the exclusion of the Krebs cycle from cellular metabolism due to metformin intoxication, in agreement with Protti et al.

We believe that the improved mortality seen in our cohort is due to aggressive use of SLED along with more gradual correction of metabolic derangements. Interestingly, recent guidelines had been published by the EXTRIP workgroup, that are much more conservative compared with our approach. In fact, hemodialysis is indicated if any of the following conditions (lactate concentration greater than 20 mmol/L; pH less than or equal to 7.0; shock; Failure of standard supportive measures; decreased level of consciousness) were present. Instead, we preferred to be more aggressive with the use of dialysis, prescribing SLED in every patient taking metformin with lactic acidosis (metabolic acidosis with an increased anion gap and lactate concentration ≥ 5 mmol/L) and AKI stage III.

### Metabolic acidosis… [^113arnxS]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a serious electrolyte disorder characterized by an imbalance in the body's acid-base balance. Metabolic acidosis has three main root causes: increased acid production, loss of bicarbonate, and a reduced ability of the kidneys to excrete excess acids. Metabolic acidosis can lead to acidemia, which is defined as arterial blood pH that is lower than 7.
35. Acidemia and acidosis are not mutually exclusive – pH and hydrogen ion concentrations also depend on the coexistence of other acid-base disorders; therefore, pH levels in people with metabolic acidosis can range from low to high. Chronic metabolic acidosis has non-specific clinical symptoms but can be readily diagnosed by testing serum bicarbonate levels in patients with chronic kidney disease as part of a comprehensive metabolic panel. Patients with CKD Stages G3–G5 should be routinely screened for metabolic acidosis.

Diagnostic approach and causes Metabolic acidosis results in a reduced serum pH that is due to metabolic and not respiratory dysfunction. Typically the serum bicarbonate concentration will be < 22 mEq/L, below the normal range of 22 to 29 mEq/L, the standard base will be more negative than -2 and the pCO~2~ will be reduced as a result of hyperventilation in an attempt to restore the pH closer to normal. Occasionally in a mixed acid-base disorder where metabolic acidosis is not the primary disorder present, the pH may be normal or high. In the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis, metabolic acidosis can be clinically diagnosed by analysis of the calculated serum bicarbonate level. Chronic metabolic acidosis is most often caused by a decreased capacity of the kidneys to excrete excess acids through renal ammoniagenesis.

The typical Western diet generates 75–100 mEq of acid daily, and individuals with normal kidney function increase the production of ammonia to get rid of this dietary acid. As kidney function declines, the tubules lose the ability to excrete excess acid, and this results in buffering of acid using serum bicarbonate, as well as bone and muscle stores.

- Hyperalimentation
- Addison disease

- Saline infusion To distinguish between the main types of metabolic acidosis, a clinical tool called the anion gap is very useful. The anion gap is calculated by subtracting the sum of the serum concentrations of major anions, chloride and bicarbonate, from the serum concentration of the major cation, sodium. Because the concentration of serum sodium is greater than the combined concentrations of chloride and bicarbonate an 'anion gap' is noted. In reality serum is electoneutral because of the presence of other minor cations and anions that are not measured in the equation that calculates the anion gap. The normal value for the anion gap is 8–16 mmol/L. An elevated anion gap (i.e.

An obtunded male with a history of alcohol abuse presented to the emergency department with metabolic acidosis, an osmolar gap and lactic acidosis. The patient was initially treated for alcohol intoxication due to an extremely high blood alcohol level. Following respiratory failure and intubation, a large volume of dark green liquid was removed via nasogastric suction; bedside fluorescence for ethylene glycol was negative. Twenty-four hours later, the patient's glomerular filtration rate decreased significantly, serum osmolality was 807, the osmolar gap was 407, complete metabolic panel showed pH of 6.8, sodium of 156 mmol/l, potassium of 7.3 mmol/l, chloride of 116, CO(2) of 3.9 and anion gap of 30.7. Blood lactic acid was > 56 mmol/l. The patient received emergency haemodialysis. Four days after presentation, the patient began to respond to voice commands and was extubated. Currently, the patient still receives haemodialysis due to ongoing renal failure, but no long-term neurologic complications are evident.

Upon initial laboratory analysis, her sodium was 142.8 mEq/L; potassium, 2.3 mEq/L; chloride, 125.5 mEq/L; calcium, 7.7 mg/dL; phosphorus, 1.1 mg/dL; magnesium, 2.6 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 17.7 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.0 mg/dL; and albumin, 4.2 g/dL. Her spot urine potassium was 16.9 mEq/L, and the transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) was 7%, suggesting renal loss. Blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.194, PCO 2 of 19.5 mmHg, PO 2 of 67.8 mmHg, HCO 3 of 7.6 mEq/L, SpO 2 of 90.2%, and a serum anion gap of 9.7, suggesting normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. Urinalysis revealed a pH of 6.5 and a urine anion gap of 6.1.

### Topiramate spinkle (Topiramate) [^113sE6HW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

Topiramate can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by topiramate. Topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of topiramate.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with topiramate in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to ≤ 2% for placebo.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis-is this on your radar? [^115dA6wo]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Metformin is a biguanide hyperglycemic agent used to manage non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Adverse reactions include mainly mild gastrointestinal adverse effects, but severe complications, such as metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) can occur. Metformin is excreted renally and, therefore, not recommended in patients with renal impairment. The reported incidence of MALA is 3 cases per 100,000 patient-years.

Case Report

A 79-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including end-stage renal disease on dialysis and type 2 diabetes, presented to the emergency department (ED) for altered mental status. Prior to arrival, she was found to be hypoglycemic. Her laboratory results were significant for creatinine of 6.56 mg/dL and an anion gap of 52 mmol/L. The venous blood gas revealed a venous pH of 6.857 [reference range (7.32–7.43)], pCO 2 of 15.9 mm Hg (40.6–60 mm Hg), HCO 3 of 2.7 mmol/L (21–30 mmol/L), lactate of 27 mmol/L (0.5–2 mmol/L), and ammonia of 233 µmol/L. The patient was dialyzed emergently in the ED; repeat laboratory test results showed blood urea nitrogen of 10 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.65 mg/dL, carbon dioxide of 26 mmol/L, and anion gap of 13 mmol/L. The repeat ammonia was 16 µmol/L. The patient's metabolic encephalopathy resolved, and she was discharged home on hospital day 3. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? MALA has a high mortality rate (36%). Laboratory markers have not been found to be a reliable predictor of mortality. Sodium bicarbonate is controversial, but a pH < 7.15 indicates consideration of its use. A pH < 7.1 and a lactate level > 20 mmol/L indicate the need for emergent hemodialysis. Prompt recognition and management in the ED with early hemodialysis can result in good patient outcomes, with a return to their baseline function despite severe laboratory findings.

### Circulating anions usually associated with the krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis [^114zLWYZ]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic acidosis is a common presentation in acute medicine and in only a minority of cases can renal failure alone be considered the sole cause of the acidosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and 'classic' lactic acidosis (taken as a blood lactate in excess of 5 mmol l -1) account for most of the remaining cases. Amongst clinicians there is an increasing awareness that there is often an important discrepancy between the measured acidosis and the associated base deficit, suggesting that other anions must contribute to the generation of the anion gap. Further evidence to support the hypothesis of additional 'missing anions' is supplied by observations on patients receiving bicarbonate-buffered haemofiltration for treatment of lactic acidosis where it is possible to calculate the net rates of lactate removal and bicarbonate donation by the haemofilter. In patients whose blood pH is slowly falling (thereby excluding any possible confounding effect of other blood buffers), it is not uncommon for the rate of bicarbonate donation to exceed the rate of lactate removal by as much as twofold (PJ Hilton, unpublished observations). This implies that not only lactic acid, but other 'unknown' acids are being neutralised by the bicarbonate in the haemofiltration replacement fluid.

Preliminary experiments performed in this laboratory with high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry on plasma ultrafiltrate obtained from patients with metabolic acidosis had suggested that anions principally associated with the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle were significantly elevated in patients with unexplained metabolic acidosis. We undertook an enzymatic study of anions of the Krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis whose standard base deficit was 8 mmol l -1 or greater. The samples were obtained from consecutive patients who fulfilled these requirements except those with a normal anion gap, which were collected subsequently. The results obtained from the patient samples were compared to control values obtained from healthy volunteers.

### Hypophosphatemia, hypokalaemia and rhabdomyolysis associated with a panic attack [^113gpjKs]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

We presented a case in which a panic attack presented with hypophosphatemia, hypokalaemia and rhabdomyolysis. Panic attacks have been associated with hypophosphatemia in numerous case reports, and hypophosphatemia has even been proposed as a biomarker for panic disorder, with serum phosphate levels being negatively correlated with anxiety level. To our knowledge, this is the first report linking rhabdomyolysis to a panic attack with hypophosphatemia, though it has been hypothesised as a possible complication.

One proposed mechanism for acute panic-related hypophosphatemia is via hyperventilation causing intracellular alkalosis, which in turn stimulates phosphofructokinase activity, increasing the rate of glycolysis and depleting phosphorus. In addition to hypophosphatemia, acute hyperventilation can cause potassium to shift into the intracellular space, resulting in clinically significant hypokalaemia. Both hypophosphatemiaand hypokalaemiacan cause rhabdomyolysis, likely in part via adenosine triphosphate depletion and relative muscle ischaemia. This mechanism of hyperventilation-associated alkalosis is a likely aetiology for the hypophosphatemia, hypokalaemia and rhabdomyolysis in this patient.

Consistent with this hypothesis, the aforementioned venous blood gas showed a reduced carbon dioxide tension indicative of a possible respiratory alkalosis, with pH on the high end of the reference range. It is worth noting that this was derived from venous rather than arterial blood, which is suboptimal for evaluating acid-base status but can be useful in the emergency department setting; and that the patient's symptoms were resolving at the time of this measurement and, therefore, his hypocarbia and alkalosis were likely more extreme at initial presentation. It is also worth noting that the initial laboratory results showed an elevated anion gap of 26 mmol/L (calculated as sodium−(chloride+bicarbonate), with a reference range of 5–15 mmol/L); this may have been reflective of the developing rhabdomyolysis, which causes overproduction of organic acidsand could hypothetically contribute to a mixed acid-base status with simultaneous respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis. While we are limited in our ability to conclusively evaluate some of these mechanistic hypotheses, there was a clear temporal association between the panic attack, electrolyte derangements and rhabdomyolysis.

### Reversible acute blindness in suspected metformin-associated lactic acidosis [^113BAZvd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Metformin is commonly used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Renal insufficiency is one of the contraindications for its use. Inadvertent prescription in patients with renal insufficiency may lead to metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA), which is associated with a high risk of mortality. Consequently, the early recognition and management of MALA is essential.

Case Report

We present the case of a 68-year-old man who had reversible blindness resulting from severe lactic acidosis. On presentation, he was alert, oriented, and had no complaints except mild abdominal discomfort and blindness. He denied any history of trauma or drug abuse. The results of the laboratory studies showed severe metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap and increased levels of serum creatinine. There were no predisposing ocular or neurologic lesions that could have induced the blindness. Although the blood levels of methanol, ethanol, and metformin were not estimated, correction of acidosis and hemodialysis led to a complete recovery. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Rarely, transient blindness may occur in patients with fatal severe metabolic acidosis. Evaluation for the presence of metabolic acidosis and a detailed medical history are essential in the management of acute blindness in such patients.

### Differential diagnosis of metabolic acidosis [^114wBZVk]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is defined as an acidemia created by one of three mechanisms: increased production of acids, decreased excretion of acids, or loss of alkali. This article addresses the identification and correct diagnosis of metabolic acidosis by reviewing important historical factors, pathophysiological principles, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings accompanying common high and normal anion gap metabolic acidoses in emergency department patients.

### Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: a clinical approach to Evaluation [^114PbRS8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Acid-base disturbances can result from kidney or nonkidney disorders. We present a case of high-volume ileostomy output causing large bicarbonate losses and resulting in a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis can present as a form of either acute or chronic metabolic acidosis. A complete clinical history and physical examination are critical initial steps to begin the evaluation process, followed by measuring serum electrolytes with a focus on potassium level, blood gas, urine pH, and either direct or indirect urine ammonium concentration. The present case was selected to highlight the differential diagnosis of a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and illustrate a systematic approach to this problem.

### Starvation ketoacidosis and refeeding syndrome [^116VYfqK]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Starvation ketoacidosis (SKA) is a rarer cause of ketoacidosis. Most patients will only have a mild acidosis, but if exacerbated by stress can result in a severe acidosis. We describe a 66-year-old man admitted with reduced consciousness and found to have a severe metabolic acidosis with raised anion gap. His body mass index (BMI) was noted to be within the healthy range at 23 kg/m 2; however, it was last documented 1 year previously at 28 kg/m 2 with no clear timeframe of weight loss. While his acidosis improved with intravenous fluids, he subsequently developed severe electrolyte imbalance consistent with refeeding during his admission. Awareness of SKA as a cause for high anion gap metabolic acidosis is important and knowledge of management including intravenous fluids, thiamine, dietetic input and electrolyte replacement is vital.

### Metabolic acidosis: pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^1117qBur]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a primary reduction in serum bicarbonate (HCO(3)(-)) concentration, a secondary decrease in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) of approximately 1 mmHg for every 1 mmol/l fall in serum HCO(3)(-) concentration, and a reduction in blood pH. Acute forms (lasting minutes to several days) and chronic forms (lasting weeks to years) of the disorder can occur, for which the underlying cause/s and resulting adverse effects may differ. Acute forms of metabolic acidosis most frequently result from the overproduction of organic acids such as ketoacids or lactic acid; by contrast, chronic metabolic acidosis often reflects bicarbonate wasting and/or impaired renal acidification. The calculation of the serum anion gap, calculated as [Na(+)] - ([HCO(3)(-)] + [Cl(-)]), aids diagnosis by classifying the disorders into categories of normal (hyperchloremic) anion gap or elevated anion gap. These categories can overlap, however. Adverse effects of acute metabolic acidosis primarily include decreased cardiac output, arterial dilatation with hypotension, altered oxygen delivery, decreased ATP production, predisposition to arrhythmias, and impairment of the immune response. The main adverse effects of chronic metabolic acidosis are increased muscle degradation and abnormal bone metabolism. Using base to treat acute metabolic acidosis is controversial because of a lack of definitive benefit and because of potential complications. By contrast, the administration of base for the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis is associated with improved cellular function and few complications.

### Anion gap… [^116vzdA9]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

For example, if the blood sample is not processed immediately after it is collected, continued cellular metabolism by leukocytes may result in an increase in the HCO^−^~3~ concentration, and result in a corresponding mild reduction in the anion gap. In many situations, alterations in renal function may modify the anion gap that may be expected to arise in a particular pathological condition. A high anion gap indicates increased concentrations of unmeasured anions by proxy. Elevated concentrations of unmeasured anions like lactate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, PO^3−^~4~, and SO^2−^~4~, which rise with disease or intoxication, cause loss of HCO^−^~3~ due to bicarbonate's activity as a buffer. Thus, finding a high anion gap should result in a search for conditions that lead to excesses of the unmeasured anions listed above.

High anion gap The anion gap is affected by changes in unmeasured ions. In uncontrolled diabetes, there is an increase in ketoacids due to metabolism of ketones. Raised levels of acid bind to bicarbonate to form carbon dioxide through the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation resulting in metabolic acidosis. In these conditions, bicarbonate concentrations decrease by acting as a buffer against the increased presence of acids. The bicarbonate is consumed by the unmeasured cation resulting in a high anion gap. Causes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis:

- Lactic acidosis
- Ketoacidosis
- Diabetic ketoacidosis
- Hazardous alcohol use
- **Toxicants**:

- Methanol
- Ethylene glycol
- Propylene glycol
- Lactic acid
- Uremia
- Aspirin
- Phenformin
- Iron
- Isoniazid
- Cyanide, coupled with elevated venous oxygenation.
- Kidney failure, causes high anion gap acidosis by decreased acid excretion and decreased HCO^−^~3~ reabsorption. Accumulation of sulfates, phosphates, urate, and hippurate accounts for the high anion gap. Note: a useful mnemonic to remember this is MUDPILES – Methanol, Uremia, Diabetic Ketoacidosis, Paraldehyde, Infection, Lactic Acidosis, Ethylene Glycol and Salicylates. Normal anion gap In patients with a normal anion gap, the drop in HCO^−^~3~ is the primary pathology. Since there is only one other major buffering anion, it must be compensated for almost completely by an increase in Cl^−^. This is therefore also known as hyperchloremic acidosis. The HCO^−^~3~ lost is replaced by a chloride anion, and thus there is a normal anion gap.
- Gastrointestinal loss of HCO^−^~3~
- Kidney loss of HCO^−^~3~ also known as type 2 RTA).
- Renal hypoaldosterone characterized by elevated serum potassium. There are three types.

1. Low renin may be due to diabetic nephropathy or NSAIDS.
2. Low aldosterone may be due to adrenal disorders or ACE inhibitors.
3. Low response to aldosterone maybe due to potassium-sparing diuretics, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, or diabetes.
- Ingestions
- Ammonium chloride and acetazolamide, ifosfamide.
- Hyperalimentation fluids
- Some cases of ketoacidosis, particularly during rehydration with sodium-containing solutions.
- Alcohols can cause a high anion gap acidosis in some patients, but a mixed picture in others due to concurrent metabolic alkalosis.

### Double trouble: ten-year-old girl with chronic diarrhea and acute abdominal pain [^114juKQK]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Prior to presenting to our institution, she had presented to an outside hospital ED. She was given a fluid bolus and intravenous ondansetron. An abdominal X-ray performed was read as normal. She was subsequently discharged. Due to persistent symptoms, she presented to our ED that same evening.

Upon presentation to our ED, her initial physical examination revealed sinus tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, delayed capillary refill of 3 to 4 seconds, normoactive bowel sounds, and diffuse abdominal pain with palpation, most notable at the periumbilical region, without peritoneal signs. She was given a fluid bolus for dehydration and intravenous acetaminophen for the abdominal pain. Her blood glucose was 69 mg/dL; she received a 10% dextrose bolus. Her basic metabolic panel was significant for metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap, acute kidney injury, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and hyponatremia. Complete blood count with differential showed lymphopenia but was otherwise unremarkable. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were normal. Urinalysis was significant for specific gravity greater than 1.030, ketonuria of 80 mg/dL, and 5 to 10 RBCs/HPF (red blood cells per high power field). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her abdomen and pelvis ruled out appendicitis and revealed trace intra-pelvic free fluid. Stool studies including parasitic panel were sent. She was admitted to the inpatient pediatric service for further workup and care.

A 40-year-old female with a history of glue sniffing and intravenous drug use presented to hospital with a week's history of feeling generally unwell. She had had multiple admissions to hospital with similar presentations in the past. On examination, the only significant clinical finding was that of a reduced level of consciousness. Laboratory investigations revealed a hyperchloremic normal anion gap metabolic acidosis with a positive urine anion gap and a urine pH of 6.5 combined with a severely low hypokalaemia. She was subsequently diagnosed with renal tubular acidosis type 1, secondary to toluene exposure from glue sniffing and was treated with intravenous fluids and potassium replacement and discharged home with oral potassium citrate and advised to stop her inhalant use.

### Topiramate (Topamax) [^1159T4KR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

TOPAMAX can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by TOPAMAX. TOPAMAX-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of TOPAMAX.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with TOPAMAX in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for TOPAMAX (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to ≤ 2% for placebo.

### Hyperchloremic acidosis… [^115JyfUH]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

Hyperchloremic acidosis is a form of metabolic acidosis associated with a normal anion gap, a decrease in plasma bicarbonate concentration, and an increase in plasma chloride concentration. Although plasma anion gap is normal, this condition is often associated with an increased urine anion gap, due to the kidney's inability to secrete ammonia. Causes In general, the cause of a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis is a loss of base, either a gastrointestinal loss or a renal loss.
- Gastrointestinal loss of bicarbonate
- Severe diarrhea
- Pancreatic fistula with loss of bicarbonate rich pancreatic fluid
- Nasojejunal tube losses in the context of small bowel obstruction and loss of alkaline proximal small bowel secretions
- Chronic laxative abuse.
- Renal causes
- Proximal renal tubular acidosis with failure of HCO^−^~3~ resorption
- Distal renal tubular acidosis with failure of H^+^~~ secretion
- Long-term use of a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as acetazolamide.
- Other causes
- Ingestion of ammonium chloride, hydrochloric acid, or other acidifying salts
- The treatment and recovery phases of diabetic ketoacidosis
- Volume resuscitation with 0. 9% normal saline provides a chloride load, so that infusing more than 3–4L can cause acidosis

### Lactation ketoacidosis induced by breastfeeding while on a ketogenic diet [^111xeN5f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Lactation ketoacidosis is a very rare cause of metabolic acidosis in breastfeeding patients. We present a case of a 34-year-old female, 8-weeks postpartum, who was breastfeeding while also on the ketogenic diet. She developed dyspnea, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, and an inability to tolerate oral intake for several days. She presented with a metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 33, HCO3 of 5.1 mmol/L, venous pH of 7.045, and serum b-hydroxybutyrate of 7.4 mmol/L. She was treated in the emergency department with intravenous normal saline and intravenous dextrose, with prompt transfer to the intensive care unit for treatment with an intravenous sodium bicarbonate drip and an intravenous insulin drip with dextrose. After normalization of laboratory values, she re-developed an elevated anion gap acidosis after breastfeeding in the ICU overnight. She was started on a carbohydrate-rich diet and made a full recovery without reported repeat incidences. We provide a summary of our case, discuss known causes of lactation ketoacidosis, and emphasize the importance of a thorough history and physical. In this case a dietary history was more helpful than a very expensive laboratory and imaging evaluation.

### Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome: brain death following hemodialysis for metabolic acidosis and acute renal failure – a case report [^1126dNH5]. BMC Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 22-year-old homosexual male presented to hospital with progressive dyspnea, productive cough, generalized malaise and fever. He had a known history of intravenous cocaine abuse and recent serology in prior 3 months was negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Results of a physical examination showed signs of tachypnea, tachycardia, accessory muscle use and left lung base crackles. Tympanic temperature was 34.7°C. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable except for urethral meatus stenosis.

Initial laboratory investigations are presented in Table 1. Arterial blood gases showed pH of 6.95, PaCO 2 10 mmHg, PaO 2 109 mmHg, HCO 3 2 mmol/L, and lactate 0.6 mmol/L consistent with high anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were 587 μmol/L and 46.7 mmol/L, respectively. Toxicology and drug screen was negative. The metabolic acidosis was partially accounted for by acute renal failure with retained unmeasured anions and ketonemia. Urinalysis showed pyuria. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm.

### Prediabetes directly deteriorates into diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome triggered by acute pancreatitis: a case report illustrating a "Chicken and egg" paradigm in ketosis-prone diabetes [^116jvjoy]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Taken together, this patient was diagnosed with DKA and HHS on admission and was triaged into the ICU and started on IV fluids, IV bicarbonate, and IV insulin drip, in accordance with diabetes crisis management guidelines. Of note, the patient also presented with severe hyperkalemia with ECG changes. Hyperkalemia is a common finding in DKA, and is secondary to hypoinsulinemia and renal dysfunction (e.g. acute kidney injury in this case); the hyperkalemia is not due to the previously held opinion that metabolic acidosis causes the exchange of hydrogen ions for potassium ions across cell membranes. The severe anion gap acidosis was corrected by the second day of admission with repeat ABG showing pH 7.42, pCO 2 31 mmHg, pO 2 116%, HCO 3 − 20.1 mmol/L, SaO 2 99%, BMP: sodium 145 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, bicarbonate 16 mmol/L, anion gap 19 mmol/L, BUN 24 mg/dL, creatinine 0.77 mg/dL, glucose 366 mg/dL, repeat ECG showed normalized T waves.

The patient also presented with abdominal pain on admission. Initially, this pain was diagnosed as DKA-associated abdominal pain. However, she had persistent abdominal pain despite the closure of the anion gap and correction of DKA and HHS. Additional laboratory tests revealed lipase 720 U/L and amylase 225 U/L, suggesting acute pancreatitis. CT of abdomen and pelvis without contrast found mild–moderate right-sided hydronephrosis and hydroureter down to the level of a 6-mm stone in the proximal-mid right ureter without significant pancreatic changes. MRCP showed no biliary or pancreatic duct dilation. Current diagnostic criteria of acute pancreatitis require two out of three of the following criteria: (1) acute abdominal pain and tenderness in the upper abdomen; (2) elevated levels of pancreatic enzymes in the blood or urine; (3) abnormal finding of acute pancreatitis detected by ultrasound, CT, or MRI. Of note, imaging studies are not 100% sensitive and in mild episodes of acute pancreatitis, CT features can range from normal-appearing pancreas to diffuse enlargement and heterogeneous attenuation of the gland. Taken together, this patient was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, although the etiology was initially unknown.

### Topiramate (eprontia) [^117DDyR5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

EPRONTIA can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by EPRONTIA. EPRONTIA induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of EPRONTIA.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with topiramate in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to ≤ 2% for placebo.

### Proximal renal tubular acidosis: a not so rare disorder of multiple etiologies [^114r5RLF]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

There have been few reports wherein didanosine has been implicated in the development of Fanconi's syndrome in HIV patients. D'Ythurbide et al. reported Fanconi syndrome and diabetes insipidus in an HIV patient being treated with didanosine, lamivudine, atazanavir and ritonavir. On admission, the patient had hypophosphatemia, hypouricemia, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap, normoglycemic glycosuria and low-molecular-weight proteinuria. High urinary phosphate excretion and high fractional excretion of phosphate indicated renal phosphate wasting. One month following discontinuation of didanosine, while continuing to treat with other drugs, the patient recovered completely from glycosuria, tubular proteinuria, metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.

Anti-convulsant therapies

Topiramate is an anti-epileptic drug which is used mainly for seizure disorders and migraine prophylaxis. Several studies have described the development of metabolic acidosis following treatment with topiramate. Sacre et al. reported a 47-year-old woman treated with topiramate for 12 months for migraine prophylaxis who developed hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with a normal GFR and positive urinary anion gap suggesting both proximal and distal RTA.

Studies have suggested inhibition of CA II by topiramate as the cause for the development of mixed RTA. Winum et al. found that topiramate is a very potent inhibitor of human CA Types II and XII and a medium potency inhibitor of Type IV CA. Maryanoff et al. by contrast, found topiramate to have low activity against CA II. However, X-ray crystallography studies have revealed a very tight association between bound topiramate and the active site of CA II consistent with topiramate's very potent inhibitory activity against CA II. This inhibition of cytosolic CA could explain very well the development of mixed RTA.

Rarely, long-term treatment with valproic acid, another anticonvulsant drug, can also cause Fanconi syndrome. Knorr et al. reported that an 8-year-old boy on valproic acid for 7 years was admitted to the hospital for status epilepticus with laboratory findings of Fanconi syndrome. On discontinuation of valproate, laboratory findings returned to normal 2 months later. More recent reports have described similar findings with laboratory values returning to normal following discontinuation of valproate. The mechanism is not clear but a direct effect of valproic acid on the mitochondria of the proximal tubules has been implicated.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

QUDEXY XR can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by QUDEXY XR. QUDEXY XR-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild to moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of QUDEXY XR.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with immediate-release topiramate in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for immediate-release topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to ≤ 2% for placebo.

### Flucloxacillin and paracetamol induced pyroglutamic acidosis [^116ruKFW]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Treatment

The HAGMA was initially of an unknown cause, so the patient was commenced on sodium bicarbonate 840 mg daily. The venous blood gas showed acidaemia (pH 7.26; pCO 2 20 mm Hg; pO 2 37 mm Hg; bicarbonate 9 mmol/L) indicating significant high anion gap metabolic acidosis (table 1). Usual causes for AKI and HAGMA were considered and excluded. Eventually, PGA was suspected to be caused by flucloxacillin and paracetamol with the risk factors being chronic kidney disease and advanced age.

The flucloxacillin was ceased and the patient was instead treated with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. This was sufficient to resolve the HAGMA without the cessation of paracetamol or the institution of a NAC infusion (table 2). In retrospect, at the time, paracetamol could also have been ceased to help resolve the HAGMA.

### Toxic alcohol ingestions: clinical features, diagnosis, and management [^115BXWUQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Alcohol-related intoxications, including methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, and propylene glycol, and alcoholic ketoacidosis can present with a high anion gap metabolic acidosis and increased serum osmolal gap, whereas isopropanol intoxication presents with hyperosmolality alone. The effects of these substances, except for isopropanol and possibly alcoholic ketoacidosis, are due to their metabolites, which can cause metabolic acidosis and cellular dysfunction. Accumulation of the alcohols in the blood can cause an increment in the osmolality, and accumulation of their metabolites can cause an increase in the anion gap and a decrease in serum bicarbonate concentration. The presence of both laboratory abnormalities concurrently is an important diagnostic clue, although either can be absent, depending on the time after exposure when blood is sampled. In addition to metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure and neurologic disease can occur in some of the intoxications. Dialysis to remove the unmetabolized alcohol and possibly the organic acid anion can be helpful in treatment of several of the alcohol-related intoxications. Administration of fomepizole or ethanol to inhibit alcohol dehydrogenase, a critical enzyme in metabolism of the alcohols, is beneficial in treatment of ethylene glycol and methanol intoxication and possibly diethylene glycol and propylene glycol intoxication. Given the potentially high morbidity and mortality of these intoxications, it is important for the clinician to have a high degree of suspicion for these disorders in cases of high anion gap metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, or unexplained neurologic disease so that treatment can be initiated early.

### Approach to metabolic acidosis in the emergency department [^116KTcQ8]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Acid-base disorders should be considered a process with the goal being to treat the patient and the underlying condition, not the numbers. A good understanding of the normal acid-base regulation in the body, as well as the most common derangements can prepare the emergency physician for this very common disorder that presents on every shift.

### Two gaps too many, three clues too few? Do elevated osmolal and anion gaps with crystalluria always mean ethylene glycol poisoning? [^116FVrMP]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 60-year-old African-American man with a medical history significant for heavy alcohol abuse, hypertension, delirium tremens, nephrolithiasis and seizure disorder was brought to the hospital with altered mental status. He was found to have high anion gap metabolic acidosis with significantly elevated lactate along with an elevated osmolal gap and calcium oxalate crystals in his urine. With this combination of findings, ethylene glycol poisoning was high in the differential. This case report describes why ethylene glycol poisoning was not the diagnosis in this patient despite the presence of these three classic laboratory findings, therefore emphasising the fact that these findings should not be taken at face value because they can be seen collectively in a patient yet each have a different cause.

### Severe hyperlactatemia with normal base excess: a quantitative analysis using conventional and stewart approaches [^112HcoT4]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Twenty percent of critically ill patients have severe hyperlactatemia with normal pH, [HCO 3 -], and [BE] levels because of a concomitant presence of hypochloremic alkalosis.

- As previously shown, both the conventional and Stewart approaches allow the correct identification of mixed metabolic acidosis and alkalosis.

- The evaluation of plasma chloride and the difference between the changes in the anion gap and bicarbonate should always be considered for a correct diagnosis of acid–base disorders.

### Recurrent high anion gap metabolic acidosis secondary to 5-oxoproline (pyroglutamic acid) [^115BLoPR]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

High anion gap metabolic acidosis in adults is a severe metabolic disorder for which the primary organic acid usually is apparent by clinical history and standard laboratory testing. We report a case of recurrent high anion gap metabolic acidosis in a 48-year-old man who initially presented with anorexia and malaise. Physical examination was unrevealing. Arterial pH was 6.98, P co 2 was 5 mm Hg, and chemistry tests showed a bicarbonate level of 3 mEq/L (3 mmol/L), anion gap of 32 mEq/L (32 mmol/L), and a negative toxicology screen result, except for an acetaminophen (paracetamol) level of 7.5 mug/mL. Metabolic acidosis resolved with administration of intravenous fluids. Subsequently, he experienced 5 more episodes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis during an 8-month span. Methanol, ethylene glycol, acetone, ethanol, d -lactate, and hippuric acid screens were negative. Lactate levels were modestly elevated, and acetaminophen levels were elevated for 5 of 6 admissions. These episodes defied explanation until 3 urinary organic acid screens, obtained on separate admissions, showed striking elevations of 5-oxoproline levels. Inborn errors of metabolism in the gamma-glutamyl cycle causing recurrent 5-oxoprolinuria and high anion gap metabolic acidosis are rare, but well described in children. Recently, there have been several reports of apparent acquired 5-oxoprolinuria and high anion gap metabolic acidosis in adults in association with acetaminophen use. Acetaminophen may, in susceptible individuals, disrupt regulation of the gamma-glutamyl cycle and result in excessive 5-oxoproline production. Suspicion for 5-oxoproline-associated high anion gap metabolic acidosis should be entertained when the cause of high anion gap metabolic acidosis remains poorly defined, the anion gap cannot be explained reasonably by measured organic acids, and there is concomitant acetaminophen use.

### Severe metabolic ketoacidosis as a primary manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-diabetic pregnancy [^113ZDyM5]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We present a case of a metabolic acidosis in a term-pregnant woman with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our patient presented with dyspnoea, tachypnoea, thoracic pain and a 2-day history of vomiting, initially attributed to COVID-19 pneumonia. Differential diagnosis was expanded when arterial blood gas showed a high anion gap metabolic non-lactate acidosis without hypoxaemia. Most likely, the hypermetabolic state of pregnancy, in combination with maternal starvation and increased metabolic demand due to infection, had resulted in metabolic ketoacidosis. Despite supportive treatment and rapid induction of labour, maternal deterioration and fetal distress during labour necessitated an emergency caesarean section. The patient delivered a healthy neonate. Postpartum, after initial improvement in metabolic acidosis, viral and bacterial pneumonia with subsequent significant respiratory compromise were successfully managed with oxygen supplementation and corticosteroids. This case illustrates how the metabolic demands of pregnancy can result in an uncommon presentation of COVID-19.

### Early anion gap metabolic acidosis in acetaminophen overdose [^112Dze4N]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The study aimed to determine the incidence and clinical significance of early high (> 15 mEq/L) anion gap metabolic acidosis in acetaminophen (APAP) overdose.

Methods

A retrospective review of a cohort of 74 patients presenting within 24 hours of APAP overdose was conducted.

Results

Early high anion gap metabolic acidosis was present in 41% of patients on admission and persisted for 1.5 ± 0.1 days. The anion gap was associated with an elevated lactate level (4.5 ± 1 mmol/L) (r(2) = 0.66, P < .05), which persisted for 1 day. The lactate level increased in proportion to the APAP concentration (r(2) = 0.75, P < .05). Patients with increased anion gap had a higher incidence of confusion (48% vs 3%; P < .001) and lethargy (39% vs 6%; p = 0.003). Early high anion gap metabolic acidosis was found in the absence of shock or liver failure. All patients were treated with N-acetylcysteine and, despite the early high anion gap metabolic acidosis, none developed hepatic failure or hypoglycemia.

Conclusion

Early high anion gap metabolic acidosis in patients with APAP overdose is self-limited and does not predict clinical or laboratory outcomes. Persistent or late metabolic acidosis in the absence of liver failure is not likely due to APAP and should prompt a search for other causes of metabolic acidosis. Finally, APAP overdose should be considered in patients presenting to the emergency department with altered mental status, as this is a treatable condition when detected early.

### Hypokalemic paralysis associated with cystic disease of the kidney: case report [^116Fe3ve]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Urinalysis revealed a urine pH of 6.5 and 7.5 on two occasions. There were a few calcium oxalate crystals and 2–4 red cells per high power field. There was also a mild hypercalciuria, with a 24-hour urinary calcium excretion of 0.134 mmol/kg (upper limit 0.1 mmol/kg/day). The rest his urinalysis was normal and there was no glycosuria or proteinuria.

At the time of peak paralysis, the arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.45 (7.35–7.45), pCO 2 of 22.4 mmHg (36–44), pO 2 of 129 mmHg (80–100), Oxygen saturation of 99%, Bicarbonate of 15.6 mmol/l (22–28), and a base excess of (-)8.6 mEq/l. This picture was suggestive of a compensated metabolic acidosis. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and daily arterial blood gases were performed. These continued to show metabolic acidosis (pH: 7.20–7.25). Plasma anion gap was 12.2 mEq/l (10–14). Thus this patient had normotensive hypokalemia with a normal anion gap (hyperchloremic) metabolic acidosis, and persistently alkaline urine (his urine pH was > 5.5 despite metabolic acidosis). The urine anion gap was positive (U Na 120 + U K 24 - U Cl 116 = 28). These findings are compatible with renal tubular acidosis (RTA), most likely distal/type 1 RTA (dRTA 1).

### The anion gap [^112mhVzE]. The New England Journal of Medicine (1977). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "Serum Anion Gap" for lithium toxicity, ethylene glycol poisoning, sepsis and septic shock, chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis and diabetic ketoacidosis.

The Anion Gap Calculator measures the difference between cations (Na⁺) and anions (Cl⁻ + HCO₃⁻) in blood to evaluate metabolic acidosis. It identifies normal, elevated, or low anion gaps, aiding in diagnosing acid-base disorders.

The Anion Gap calculator provides a way to assess metabolic acidosis by analyzing the concentrations of sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate in the blood. Here's how it works:

You start with three key inputs, measured in mmol/L:
- **Sodium**: Typically falls within a range of 120 to 160.
- **Chloride**: Ranges from 70 to 130.
- **Bicarbonate**: Generally between 10 and 40.

With these values, the anion gap is determined using the formula:
Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate)

This simple calculation yields an output, the anion gap, which is measured in mmol/L and usually falls within a physiological range, though theoretically it can extend from 0 to 10,000.

Interpreting the anion gap provides valuable clinical insights:

- A normal anion gap is typically between 8 and 12 mmol/L. This range suggests there are no significant unmeasured anions affecting the blood plasma.
- A high anion gap, generally above 12 mmol/L, may signal conditions such as ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, renal failure, or the ingestion of particular toxins like methanol or ethylene glycol.
- A low anion gap is less frequent and could be linked to hypoalbuminemia, hypercalcemia, or other more rare conditions.

By entering the values for sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate into the calculator, you can compute the anion gap and interpret the results to identify possible metabolic disturbances based on these guidelines.
