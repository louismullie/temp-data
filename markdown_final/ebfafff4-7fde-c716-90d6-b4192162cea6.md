## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a physical therapy program for a 15-year-old girl with rotator cuff tendinitis and/or subacromial bursitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical diagnosis and how it influences prognosis and exercise selection. Then, I should verify the overarching principles that guide nonoperative care in adolescents. Next, I will outline phase-based rehabilitation with specific exercises, dosing, and progression rules. After that, I need to check adjunct modalities and what to avoid. Finally, I will integrate return-to-activity criteria, monitoring tools, and a concise home program summary, while noting any pediatric-specific considerations and evidence limitations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. Rotator cuff tendinitis and subacromial bursitis are best understood within the spectrum of rotator cuff–related shoulder pain, which in adolescents often reflects overuse, overload, or biomechanical contributors rather than degenerative change, and this framing aligns with contemporary guidelines and systematic reviews that emphasize active rehabilitation as first-line management [^113jq1nf] [^111mZibu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pathology dictating treatment. I should verify the guiding principles: active, progressive, load-managed exercise is foundational; supervised or structured programs are reasonable but evidence is mixed on supervision versus advice-only models; pain-guided progression is acceptable within limits; and scapular control and rotator cuff strengthening are core elements, with manual therapy as an adjunct for short-term pain relief rather than a primary modality [^113jq1nf] [^112moWqG] [^116a4k3x].

> I will now examine the phase-based framework. Phase 1 focuses on pain control, protected range, and education; Phase 2 emphasizes restoration of motion, scapular mechanics, and isometric or low-load activation; Phase 3 progresses to progressive strengthening through range; Phase 4 integrates functional and sport-specific loading with return-to-activity criteria. This structure mirrors impairment-based protocols and pragmatic trials that progressed over roughly 12–16 weeks, with flexibility based on symptoms and function [^114ok6ds] [^112moWqG] [^113NSk4d].

> Let me think about Phase 1 specifics. I should confirm that we avoid aggravating positions and heavy loads while maintaining gentle, pain-limited active motion. Education should cover load management, activity modification, and a simple pain-monitoring rule such as allowing pain up to about 3–5/10 during exercise that returns to baseline within 24 hours, adjusting load if pain persists. Ice and NSAIDs can be used short term if needed, and I need to ensure we do not immobilize, which risks stiffness in adolescents [^11496BFV] [^116VMcgw] [^113cYhcw].

> Next, I should review Phase 2. Restoration of full pain-free range of motion is prioritized, with posterior capsule and pectoralis minor stretching, thoracic extension mobility, and scapular positioning drills. Isometrics for the rotator cuff in neutral positions and low-load scapular stabilization can begin, progressing to light band or bodyweight activation once pain allows. I should double-check that scapula-focused programs show medium-term benefits even if short-term effects are modest, which supports including them here [^113jZhGe] [^114ok6ds].

> For Phase 3, I need to ensure progressive, resisted strengthening through the full arc. External rotation at 0–45 degrees of abduction, scaption with external rotation, prone horizontal abduction, and rows are appropriate, with 2–3 sets of 10–15 reps at a load that allows 1–2 reps in reserve. Progression can use bands, light weights, or cables, and I should confirm that progressive resisted exercise outperforms nonprogressive or nonresisted programs for pain and disability, which the evidence supports despite low-to-moderate certainty [^114Ewb7c] [^111yNpeb].

> Wait, let me verify the role of eccentric loading. I initially thought to prioritize eccentrics, but hold on, I should verify the magnitude and timing of benefit. Meta-analytic data suggest eccentric-focused programs may reduce pain in the medium term but show no consistent short- or long-term advantage over other resisted programs, so I should integrate eccentrics as part of a varied load program rather than relying on them exclusively [^112VRhcK].

> I will now examine Phase 4. Functional progression should mirror the patient's goals, whether sport-specific or daily function, with gradual reintroduction of overhead and cross-body activities once strength and scapular control are adequate. I should confirm that return-to-sport guidance emphasizes capacity and load tolerance, tracked with validated patient-reported outcomes and functional tests, even though much of the evidence base is adult-focused and graded as low quality for pediatrics [^111SZxqh] [^116vyGiR].

> Let me consider adjuncts and what to avoid. Manual therapy can be used selectively for short-term pain relief, and taping may reduce pain briefly, but neither should replace exercise. I need to ensure we avoid passive modalities like therapeutic ultrasound or shockwave for noncalcific disease, as guidelines advise against their routine use. If pain flares persist, a single ultrasound-guided subacromial corticosteroid injection can be considered for short-term relief, but it is not first-line and does not improve long-term outcomes [^116a4k3x] [^113fa2fT] [^117748mQ].

> I should double-check pediatric-specific issues. Adolescents generally have excellent healing potential and respond well to load-managed strengthening, but growth plates and apophyses warrant caution with heavy, end-range loading. Therefore, I will emphasize submaximal, form-focused strengthening and avoid maximal, ballistic loads until maturity and symptom resolution permit, adapting the adult protocols conservatively and monitoring for growth-related pain patterns [^notfound].

> Next, I should review monitoring and outcomes. Validated tools such as the SPADI or QuickDASH can track pain and function, and simple strength tests like external rotation at 45 degrees abduction and scapular plane abduction can guide progression. I need to ensure we reassess every 2–4 weeks and adjust load, volume, or exercise selection based on pain, function, and strength gains, aligning with pragmatic trial follow-up intervals and guideline emphasis on measurable progress [^112moWqG] [^111SZxqh].

> But wait, what if symptoms plateau or worsen despite adherence. I should confirm red flags and consider imaging if there is acute trauma, severe night pain, gross weakness, or failure to improve by 3 months. Persistent cases may merit referral for sports medicine or orthopedic evaluation to exclude full-thickness tears, instability, or other pathology, recognizing that most adolescent cases remain nonsurgical with appropriate rehabilitation [^notfound].

> Finally, I will synthesize a concise home program the patient can follow. Daily posterior capsule stretch, pectoralis minor stretch, thoracic extension mobility, scapular setting and Y-T-W drills, isometrics for external rotation and internal rotation at neutral, and progressive band exercises for external rotation, scaption, and rows, starting at 2 sets of 10–15 reps and advancing load or reps every 1–2 weeks as pain allows. I should confirm adherence strategies such as diaries or videos, and reinforce that consistency over 12–16 weeks is typical for meaningful recovery in rotator cuff–related shoulder pain [^112moWqG] [^113NSk4d].

A 15-year-old with rotator cuff tendinitis/subacromial bursitis should follow a **phased, supervised program** emphasizing pain control, progressive loading, and scapular mechanics, with return to sport guided by symptom resolution and strength symmetry [^113jq1nf] [^111SZxqh]. The program spans **4 phases over 12–16 weeks**: Phase 1 (weeks 1–2) focuses on pain control, activity modification, and gentle ROM; Phase 2 (weeks 3–6) adds isometrics and scapular stabilization; Phase 3 (weeks 7–10) progresses to eccentric and functional strengthening; Phase 4 (weeks 11–16) advances to sport-specific drills and gradual return to full activity [^112moWqG] [^113NSk4d]. Key elements include **eccentric rotator cuff loading**, scapular control, and progressive load with pain monitoring (≤ 5/10 during exercise) [^116VMcgw] [^114RZyCg]. Manual therapy and taping may be added short term for pain relief, but passive modalities are not recommended [^116a4k3x] [^113fa2fT]. Expected outcomes include reduced pain, restored ROM, and symmetric strength, with low recurrence when adherence and load management are maintained [^114Ewb7c] [^114MGjuF].

---

## Adjunctive interventions

- **Manual therapy**: short-term pain relief, improve mobility [^116a4k3x].
- **Taping**: short-term pain modulation, support scapular position [^114i8yH3].
- **Injections**: consider corticosteroid only if persistent pain despite adherence; not first-line [^117748mQ].

---

## Patient education and adherence

Emphasize **adherence to the program and load management** [^115URABz]; provide a written home exercise plan with clear instructions and progression criteria. Reinforce activity modification and ergonomic adjustments to reduce shoulder load [^116HJ1KU].

---

## Expected outcomes and prognosis

With adherence, **most adolescents improve within 12–16 weeks**, with low recurrence when load management and maintenance exercises continue [^notfound]. Persistent symptoms beyond 3 months warrant reassessment for alternative diagnoses or advanced imaging [^notfound].

Introduction

Shoulder disorders are a common cause of persistent musculoskeletal morbidity, particularly in the middle to older age groups. Pain and compromised shoulder function have a substantial impact on tasks essential to daily living, as well as on sleep. Shoulder disorders are a common reason for seeking medical care and may require surgical intervention in up to 28% of cases. Shoulder disorders can thus lead to considerable disability, reduced health related quality of life, absenteeism from work, and use of healthcare resources.

Although definitions of different diagnostic categories of shoulder pain are controversial, a large proportion of shoulder problems can be classified as "rotator cuff disease", the most common cause of shoulder pain in primary care. The term, or its variants such as impingement syndrome, may include a spectrum of pathologies of rotator cuff disease (such as subacromial bursitis, partial rotator cuff tears, and bicipital tendinosis), but they are characterised clinically by pain with abduction (painful arc) and signs of impingement. Although standard criteria have not been established for use in clinical trials, most trials that have assessed interventions for rotator cuff disease have used variations of these features to select their study populations. Rotator cuff disease differs from other major diagnostic categories of shoulder pain such as adhesive capsulitis, osteoarthritis, and calcific tendinitis, which are known to have different presentations, underlying causes, prognoses, and responses to treatment.

A combination of modalities of physiotherapy, such as manual therapy and exercise, is often used in the management of rotator cuff disease. These aim to correct modifiable physical impairments thought to contribute to pain and dysfunction rather than to treat the specific pathology. These impairments include rotator cuff and scapular muscle weakness and dysfunction, tightness of the posterior capsule and other soft tissues, and postural abnormalities. Little conclusive evidence supports or refutes the efficacy of different physiotherapy programmes given the variable methodological quality of the trials, including a lack of placebo control and the fact that many tested a single modality despite multimodality treatment being the most common way in which physiotherapists treat shoulder disorders. The conclusions and recommendations of recent systematic reviews support the need for further clinical trials. The primary aim of this trial was, therefore, to determine whether a 10 week programme of standardised manual therapy and home exercise delivered by a physiotherapist improves shoulder pain and function more than placebo treatment does in people with chronic rotator cuff disease.

### Comprehensive impairment-based exercise and manual therapy intervention for patients with subacromial impingement syndrome: a case series [^114ok6ds]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case series.

Background

Few studies have defined the dosage and specific techniques of manual therapy and exercise for rehabilitation for patients with subacromial impingement syndrome. This case series describes a standardized treatment program for subacromial impingement syndrome and the time course and outcomes over a 12-week period.

Case Description

Ten patients (age range, 19–70 years) with subacromial impingement syndrome defined by inclusion and exclusion criteria were treated with a standardized protocol for 10 visits over 6 to 8 weeks. The protocol included a 3-phase progressive strengthening program, manual stretching, thrust and nonthrust manipulation to the shoulder and spine, patient education, activity modification, and a daily home exercise program of stretching and strengthening. Patients completed a history and measures of impairments and functional disability at 2, 4, 6, and 12 weeks.

Outcomes

Treatment success was defined as both a 50% improvement on the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score and a global rating of change of at least "moderately better". At 6 weeks, 6 of 10 patients had a successful (mean ± SD) DASH outcome score (initial, 33.9 ± 16.2; 6 weeks, 8.1 ± 9.2). At 12 weeks, 8 of 10 patients had a successful DASH outcome score (initial, 33.1 ± 14; 12 weeks, 8.3 ± 6.4). As a group, the largest improvement was in the first 2 weeks. The most common impairments for all 10 patients were rotator cuff and trapezius muscle weakness (10 of 10 patients), limited shoulder internal rotation motion (8 of 10 patients), and reduced kyphosis of the midthoracic area (7 of 10 patients).

Discussion

A program aimed at strengthening rotator cuff and scapular muscles, with stretching and manual therapy aimed at thoracic spine and the posterior and inferior soft-tissue structures of the glenohumeral joint appeared to be successful in the majority of patients. This case series describes a comprehensive impairment-based treatment which resulted in symptomatic and functional improvement in 8 of 10 patients in 6 to 12 weeks.

Level Of Evidence

Therapy, level 4.

### Progressive exercise compared with best practice advice, with or without corticosteroid injection, for the treatment of patients with rotator cuff disorders (GRASP): a multicentre, pragmatic, 2 × 2 factorial, randomised controlled trial [^113DAPLX]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Added value of this study

To our knowledge, the GRASP trial is the largest randomised controlled trial to date that has assessed the effects of exercise interventions, with or without the use of subacromial corticosteroid injection, in adults with a new episode of shoulder pain attributable to a rotator cuff disorder. Our findings during 12-month follow-up showed that the progressive exercise intervention was not superior to a best practice advice session with a physiotherapist. Subacromial corticosteroid injection was not superior to having no injection during 12-month follow-up, apart from modest improvement in shoulder pain and function at 8 weeks; the greatest benefit being in those with worse pain and functional impairment. The health economic comparison found that best practice advice in combination with corticosteroid injection is expected to be the most cost-effective, although some uncertainty remains around this conclusion.

Implications of all the available evidence

The GRASP trial shows that a single face-to-face session with a physiotherapist is likely to be more cost-effective and is not significantly different in terms of clinical outcomes when compared with a comprehensive physiotherapy intervention of up to six face-to-face sessions. This finding is particularly important given the incidence of rotator cuff disorders and the need to develop cost-effective and pragmatic methods of dealing with this high volume of conditions. Subacromial corticosteroid injection provides a modest short-term but no long-term benefit, as seen in other trials, and was associated with participants being more likely to report doing their exercises as advised.

Evidence from small, short-term trials suggests that physiotherapist-prescribed exercise is promising. However, a Cochrane review highlighted the insufficient evidence about the treatment's long-term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Despite widespread provision, uncertainty exists about which types of exercise and levels of physiotherapy supervision are associated with the best outcomes. This evidence is limited by problems in study design and lack of comparator groups. Progressive resistance training to improve muscular strength, whether supervised or home based, has been identified as a core component of exercise for patients with rotator cuff disorders. Subacromial corticosteroid injections are commonly used to reduce local tissue inflammation and pain. Compared with placebo, corticosteroid injections have short-term benefit in the shoulder, although the longer-term benefits and harms are not known. Corticosteroid injections are being used increasingly in clinical practice alongside physiotherapy for the management of people with rotator cuff disorders; hence justification for investigating corticosteroid injection in the GRASP (Getting it Right: Addressing Shoulder Pain) trial alongside physiotherapist-prescribed exercise.

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^115jUG9J]. AAOS (2025). High credibility.

Surgical treatment vs. physical therapy for low- or intermediate-grade partial-thickness rotator cuff tears — In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that physical therapy can improve outcomes in patients with low-grade or intermediate-grade partial-thickness rotator cuff tears, and in patients with persistent pain and functional impairment after appropriate non-operative treatment, surgery can improve outcomes. Strength of Evidence: Consensus and Strength of Recommendation: Consensus, with the description noting that in the absence of reliable evidence the guideline workgroup is making a recommendation based on their clinical opinion. The rationale reports that no studies that compared PT versus surgery outright were identified, but in cohorts both surgery and PT had favorable outcomes. Nonsurgical treatment including physical therapy is suggested for partial-thickness tears due to low evidence of progression of tear severity, and treatment of partial-thickness tears should follow guidelines for subacromial pain.

### Diagnosing, managing, and supporting return to work of adults with rotator cuff disorders: a clinical practice guideline [^116ARMEa]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a clinical practice guideline covering the assessment, management, and return to work of adults with rotator cuff disorders. DESIGN: Clinical practice guideline. METHODS: Using systematic reviews, appraisal of the literature, and an iterative approach to obtain consensus from key stakeholders, clinical recommendations and algorithms were developed in the context of the health care system and work environment of the province of Quebec (Canada). RESULTS: Recommendations (n = 73) and clinical decision algorithms (n = 3) were developed to match the objectives. The initial assessment should include the patient's history, a subjective assessment, and a physical examination. Diagnostic imaging is only necessary in select circumstances. Acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and injection therapies may be useful to reduce pain in the short term. Clinicians should prescribe an active and task-oriented rehabilitation program (exercises and education) to reduce pain and disability in adults with rotator cuff disorders. Subacromial decompression is not recommended to treat rotator cuff tendinopathy. Surgery is appropriate for selected patients with a full-thickness rotator cuff tear. A return-to-work plan should be developed early, in collaboration with the worker and other stakeholders, and must combine multiple strategies to promote return to work. CONCLUSION: This clinical practice guideline was developed to assist the multidisciplinary team of clinicians who provide health care for adults with a rotator cuff disorder. The CPG guides clinical decisionmaking for diagnosis and treatment, and planning for successful return to work. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2022;52(10):647–664.

### Effect of resistance exercise dose components for tendinopathy management: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^111mZibu]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This review was part of a project funded by the National Institute for Health Research (Health Technology Assessment 129388 Exercise therapy for the treatment of tendinopathies) and adhered to an a priori protocol (PROSPERO 2020 CRD42020168187).

Inclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria and methods were influenced by the project aims, the results of an initial scoping reviewand two subsequent stakeholder workshops (n = 13). The first included nine individuals who delivered exercise therapy for tendinopathy and had an academic interest. The second included four women with lived experience. Finally, an online survey (n = 26) was conducted to gather the views of a more diverse international sample of purposefully selected clinicians and academics. A completed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis checklist for reporting of systematic reviews can be found in online supplemental file 1. The inclusion criteria were framed according to a modified PICOS (participant, intervention, comparator, outcomes, study type) approach which also included context.

Participants

This meta-analysis included people of any age or gender with a diagnosis of RCRSP, lateral elbow, patellar, Achilles or gluteal tendinopathy of any severity or duration. Due to difficulty in diagnosing the patho-anatomical cause of shoulder painthe term RCRSP is defined here as pain, impaired movement and function of the shoulder from one or more structures (encompassing subacromial pain/impingement syndrome (SIS), rotator cuff tendinopathy and subacromial bursitis). We included studies that described participants as having tendinopathy, SIS or RCRSP, thereby acknowledging that participants may have tendinopathy+/−involvement of other structures. Full thickness or large tears were excluded, for all tendinopathies. Trial authors' diagnoses were accepted where a clearly verifiable group of clinical features was reported including: pathognomonic location of pain; a symptom altering response to applied load and/or stretch, with there being a specific test for most tendinopathies; strategies to rule out differential diagnoses; ultrasound or MRI confirmation of structural change. Typically, a minimum of two clinical features were acceptable, however often more were reported. Data from studies with mixed groups were included where there was clear reporting of the tendinopathic group, or they comprised > 90% of the investigated cohort.

### Effectiveness of a sport-specific exercise programme for overhead athletes with unilateral subacromial shoulder pain: a study protocol of a randomised controlled trial [^116xPPgh]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

This protocol describes an RCT designed to compare the effectiveness of a sport-specific exercise programme versus a scapular stability programme in CrossFit athletes with unilateral SSP. The study aims to establish this population's most clinically effective approach for improving shoulder function, pain reduction, strength and training adaptations.

This protocol will also be used for a randomised trial registered in Australia (ACTRN12624000798561p). The trial findings will be disseminated at international conferences, published in peer-reviewed journals and shared with participants via personalised reports. The study results will be publicly available through open-access platforms and institutional websites.

The main strengths of this trial include its randomised design, sport-specific population and comprehensive outcome measures, allowing for a robust evaluation of intervention effectiveness. Furthermore, the study incorporates a standardised progression model, adherence tracking strategies and real-world implementation within athletes' regular training environments, enhancing its external validity and clinical relevance. The use of blinded outcome assessments, objective performance measures and a detailed statistical framework further strengthens the study's methodological rigour.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for rotator cuff disorders, more specifically with respect to physical therapy, AAOS 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that patient-reported outcomes improve with physical therapy in symptomatic patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears, but the rotator cuff tear size, muscle atrophy, and fatty infiltration may progress over 5–10 years with nonsurgical management.

### Specific versus general exercise programme in adults with subacromial impingement syndrome: a randomised controlled trial [^114svBgw]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Experimental group

In addition to the usual care, the experimental group participated in a 5-week, two times per week, supervised, specific exercise programme based on the clinical decision algorithm proposed by a panel of experts. In the initial stage, ' scapular orientation ' was trained to improve proprioception and normalise the resting position of the scapula. Then, three scapular control exercises were performed: bilateral shoulder flexion up to 60°; a closed kinetic chain exercise (the ' unilateral bench press '); and a scapular control exercise with bilateral shoulder retraction and extension in the prone position. The final stage included two glenohumeral control exercises to restore centralisation and prevent superior translation of the humeral head: isometric external rotation performed with shoulder adduction; and isometric adduction of the shoulder in the scapular plane at 30° and 60° of elevation (see online supplemental table S1). The exercises were performed without pain, and a maximum of four exercises were performed per session. The dose and progressions were related to the goal of each exercise; 8–10 repetitions of each exercise with a 5–10 s hold and 30 s to 1 min of rest between each repetition.

Control group

In addition to the usual care, participants in the control group participated in a 5-week, two times per week, supervised, general exercise programme based on a previous clinical trial. This programme consisted of physiotherapy sessions involving mainly strengthening, stretching and mobility exercises (see online supplemental tables S2 and S3). The aim was to restore strength, mobility and coordination between the rotator cuff and the shoulder girdle, to unload the subacromial space and to centre the humeral head in the glenoid fossa during active movements.

Finally, the duration and periodicity of the treatment was similar, the difference between both therapeutic interventions was in the duration of the treatment sessions, for the experimental group it was 1 hour on average, while for the control group it was 1 hour 30 min.

### Orthopaedic manual physical therapy for shoulder pain and impaired movement in a patient with glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis: a case report [^114MfEjo]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case report.

Background

Comprehensive treatment strategies are needed for individuals with glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis (OA), especially when they are young and active. Prior dislocation, with or without subsequent shoulder stabilization surgery, complicates the clinical presentation and increases the risk of OA progression. The purpose of this case report was to describe an orthopaedic manual physical therapy approach used in a patient with glenohumeral joint OA who presented with shoulder pain and impaired movement. CASE DESCRIPTION A 38-year-old male military officer presented with left-shoulder pain of 2 months in duration that was unrelieved with a subacromial injection. He reported a history of anterior-inferior dislocation with subsequent stabilization surgery 15 years prior and arthroscopic subacromial decompression 2 years prior. Physical examination demonstrated painful limitations in shoulder elevation and internal/external rotation movements, stiffness with testing using accessory glides, and rotator cuff and scapular musculature weakness associated with pain.

Outcomes

Treatment consisted of 5 sessions provided over 4 weeks. The plan of care included manual physical therapy, exercises, and progressive functional activities specifically tailored to the patient's clinical presentation. Shoulder Pain and Disability Index scores decreased from 43% to 17%, and the Patient-Specific Functional Scale average score improved from 3.0 to 7.3 out of 10. After 4 additional weeks of a home exercise program, the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index score was 4% and Patient-Specific Functional Scale average score was 9.0. Improvements in self-reported function were maintained at 6 months. Four "booster" treatment sessions were administered at 9 months, contributing to sustained outcomes through 1 year.

Discussion

In a young, active patient with glenohumeral joint OA, clinically meaningful short-term improvements in self-reported function and pain, maintained at 1 year, were observed with manual physical therapy and exercise.

Level Of Evidence

Randomization

Participants are randomized to receive operative or nonoperative treatment. Randomization is stratified by site, age, and tear size and is blocked within strata using a random sequence of differing block sizes (eg, blocks of 2, 4, and 6 could be used). Randomization strings for each site are unique and are randomly generated using an algorithm and administered in real time using a Research Electronic Data Capture randomization module.

Baseline Procedures

At baseline, participants complete study questionnaires about pain and movement, shoulder symptoms, daily and recreational activities, general and emotional health, and what treatments have been used to help the participant's shoulder. Participants also undergo a brief physical examination to measure strength and range of motion. Each participant's MRI examination is independently read using a standardized form in a blinded fashion by a musculoskeletal radiologist.

Treatment Protocols

Nonoperative and operative interventions for ARC are consistent with routine clinical standards of care for rotator cuff tears.

Nonoperative Intervention

Participants randomized to the nonoperative group of the study follow a prescribed physical therapy and home exercise program. A standardized, nonoperative rehabilitation protocol (eAppendix 1 in Supplement 2) has been developed for this trial with extensive input from our team of clinicians, researchers, and expert consultants. The duration of the nonoperative physical therapy program is approximately 3 months, with participants attending physical therapy 1 to 2 times a week, for a total of approximately 12 to 24 visits. Participants are encouraged to perform exercises at home with a dosing of therapy (physical therapy and/or home exercises) of approximately 4 times per week. The treatment stages of the nonoperative rehabilitation protocol are goal or performance based. Participants in the nonoperative group who make rapid progress may be advanced to the next stage of the rehabilitation treatment protocol if they meet the criteria to do so and may be discharged from physical therapy earlier than 3 months as appropriate. Participants perform a home exercise program during their rehabilitation program and may continue physical therapy beyond 3 months as prescribed or as deemed appropriate by their treating clinicians.

### Nonoperative treatment of chronic, massive irreparable rotator cuff tears: a systematic review with synthesis of a standardized rehabilitation protocol [^115UGU6L]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

A massive, irreparable rotator cuff tear may cause significant pain and dysfunction. However, the efficacy of nonoperative treatment modalities in this subset of patients is not currently well known. Also, there is currently no gold standard nonoperative protocol to guide treatment. The goal of the present systematic review is to determine if there is any evidence to support the use of various nonoperative treatment modalities and synthesize a standardized nonoperative treatment protocol for the patient with a massive irreparable rotator cuff tear.

Methods

A comprehensive review of the literature utilizing PRISMA guidelines was performed. Studies involving clinical outcomes of nonoperative treatment of massive, irreparable rotator cuff tears were included. Articles were reviewed by 2 reviewers to determine inclusion or exclusion based on established criteria. Selected articles were reviewed for results of clinical and functional outcomes. The studies were also reviewed to determine their level of evidence and potential sources of bias. A standardized nonoperative treatment protocol was developed by taking described elements of the protocols used in studies that demonstrated clinical improvement beyond the MCID for the outcome scores used by the authors.

Results

A total of 10 studies met inclusion criteria for our studies. Of the included studies, 1 was Level III evidence and the remaining 9 were Level IV evidence. Multiple studies showed significant improvement exceeding the MCID for functional outcome scores following treatment. Also, several studies demonstrated significant improvements in strength and range of motion. The overall success of nonoperative treatment ranged from 32%-96%. The synthesized nonoperative treatment protocol is characterized by requiring some supervised physical therapy, often requiring 12 weeks or more, focusing on supine exercises with gradual progression to upright. Corticosteroid injections and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may also be of benefit.

Conclusion

Despite low-quality evidence, nonoperative treatment has been shown to be efficacious for patients with chronic, massive, irreparable rotator cuff tears. Using these results, a synthesized rehabilitation program was developed to guide clinicians when treating patients with massive irreparable rotator cuff tears.

Rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy — exercise efficacy versus minimal/sham or no treatment: Based on low-quality to very low-certainty evidence, progressive painful and resisted exercises significantly reduce pain (MD, −1.07/10; 95% CI: −1.57, −0.56; 3 RCTs; n = 197) and disability on the Constant-Murley Score (MD, −14.96/100; 95% CI: −21.37, −8.55; 4 RCTs; n = 271) compared with basic advice, placebo detuned laser, or no treatment in the short to medium term, whereas nonprogressive resistance and nonresisted exercises do not significantly reduce pain (MD, −0.33/10; 95% CI: −0.81, 0.15; 3 RCTs; n = 198) or disability (MD, −3.62/100; 95% CI: −9.43, 2.18; 3 RCTs; n = 198). Supervised exercise versus no exercise in the short term significantly reduces pain at rest (MD, −1.68/10; 95% CI: −3.00, −0.34; 1 RCT; n = 286), during movement (MD, −1.84/10; 95% CI: −2.76, −0.91; 5 RCTs; n = 353), and disability (SMD, −0.30; 95% CI: −0.52, −0.07; 5 RCTs; n = 396). Across studies at an unspecified follow-up, exercise reduced pain (SMD, −0.94; 95% CI: −1.69, −0.19; 5 RCTs; n = 189) and disability (SMD, −0.57; 95% CI: −0.85, −0.29; 4 RCTs; n = 202) versus no treatment. A network meta-analysis pairwise comparison showed exercise reduced pain compared with no intervention (SMD, −0.42; 95% CI: −0.68, −0.15) and compared with corticosteroid injections (SMD, −0.25; 95% CI: −0.48, −0.03), and reduced disability versus no intervention in the short to medium term (SMD, −0.69; 95% CI: −0.99, −0.39) and in the medium term (SMD, −0.32; 95% CI: −0.58, −0.06). The same analysis reported shoulder taping significantly reduces disability versus exercise in the long term (SMD, −0.35; 95% CI: −0.82, −0.15), though the number and quality of RCTs were not reported and effects were based on unknown certainty of the evidence.

### Rotator cuff tendinopathy diagnosis, nonsurgical medical care, and rehabilitation: a clinical practice guideline [^114pcCUB]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Clinical assessment of suspected rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy — history and physical exam: A pathoanatomical diagnosis model for the shoulder remains of great value as it guides the clinician in the evaluation of the prognosis, establishing a patient-centered care plan and selecting therapeutic interventions, and in order to develop adequate diagnoses, the clinical assessment of a patient involves an integrated history of injury, subjective and physical assessments that may include standardized questionnaires, identification of any impairments, screening for yellow flags, use of special clinical tests, and suggesting or prescribing imaging tests if relevant. Based on a systematic review of CPGs and on recommendations from a 2001 CPG for RC disorders that was based on a consensus from a modified Delphi study, it is recommended that the evaluation of adults presenting with shoulder pain should include a thorough subjective evaluation including a detailed history, a comprehensive objective evaluation, as well as the prompt identification of yellow and red flags early on during the initial consultation or during the following reassessment.

### No need for subacromial decompression in responders to specific exercise treatment: a 10-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial [^114MGjuF]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Subacromial pain is a common and disabling condition with multifactorial etiology. Increasing evidence supports exercises as first-line treatment and need of surgery is debated. Long-term follow-ups after surgical- and nonsurgical treatment are scarce. The primary aim of the present study was to investigate the 10-year outcomes after a study comparing specific and nonspecific exercise treatment and the need for surgery. Secondarily we compared patients who had undergone exercise treatment, to those having surgery and explored the importance of rotator cuff status in relation to given treatment and outcomes.

Methods

At enrollment 2009–2010, 97 patients with long-standing subacromial pain were on the waiting list for arthroscopic subacromial decompression (ASD). They were randomized to specific exercises focusing on strengthening of the rotator cuff and scapula stabilizers (n = 51) or control: unloaded range of motion exercises (n = 46). ASD was optional during the entire observation time. Eligible patients from either group constitute the present 10-year cohort with nonoperated (n = 42) or operated (n = 41) patients. The primary outcome was shoulder function and pain after 10 years assessed by the Constant-Murley score (CMS). Secondary outcomes were proportion of patients choosing surgery and rotator cuff status related to treatment and primary outcome.

Results

At the 10-year follow-up, 83 of 97 patients (86%) participated. All patients significantly improved in CMS from baseline to 10-year follow-up, mean improvement of 37 (95% confidence interval 33–41, P < .0001). Nonoperated patients had significantly better CMS compared to operated with mean difference 11 (95% confidence interval 4–18) (P = 0.003). Significantly more patients in the control exercise group 65% (26 of 40) had chosen surgery compared to 35% (15 of 43) in the specific exercise group up until 10 years (P = 0.006). At 10 years, 55% of the patients had a partial or full-thickness rotator cuff tear compared to 28% at baseline. There was no difference in tear progression between operated and nonoperated patients (P = 0.494). In the contralateral shoulder, 51% of the patients (39 of 76) had a cuff tear compared to 3% at baseline.

Conclusions

Specific exercise treatment for patients with subacromial pain was effective and reduced the need for surgery with maintained results after 10 years. Responders to exercise treatment had the best long-term outcomes and ASD yielded satisfying outcome in nonresponders. A rotator cuff tear was equally common in patients having undergone surgery as in those treated nonoperatively and in the contralateral shoulder.

### Rehabilitation of the rotator cuff: an evaluation-based approach [^112YHxFh]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

Rotator cuff disease of the shoulder, a common condition, is often incapacitating. Whether nonsurgical or surgical, successful management of rotator cuff disease is dependent on appropriate rehabilitation. Numerous rehabilitation protocols for the management of rotator cuff disease are based primarily on anecdotal clinical observation. The available literature on shoulder rehabilitation, in conjunction with clinical observation that takes into consideration the underlying tissue quality and structural integrity of the rotator cuff, can be compiled into a set of rehabilitation guidelines. The four phases of rehabilitation begin with maintaining and protecting the repair in the immediate postoperative period, followed by progression from early passive range of motion through return to preoperative levels of function.

### Differential diagnosis… [^113cYhcw]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Treatment In patients with stage I impingement, conservative treatment is often sufficient. Conservative treatment involves resting and stopping the offending activity. It may also involve prolonged physical therapy. Sport and job modifications may be beneficial. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and ice treatments can relieve pain. Ice packs applied for 20 minutes three times a day may help. A sling is never used, because adhesive capsulitis can result from immobilization. Once the acute pain resolves, a specific strengthening program for the rotator cuff is recommended for prevention of future injuries. The motions of the rotator cuff that are emphasized for strengthening are internal rotation, external rotation and abduction.

It is important to remember that the function of the rotator cuff, in addition to generating torque, is to stabilize the glenohumeral joint; thus, stronger rotator cuff muscles result in better glenohumeral joint stabilization and less impingement. Patients with stage II impingement may require a formal physical therapy program. Isometric stretches are useful in restoring range of motion. Isotonic exercises are preferable to variable weight exercises. Thus, the shoulder exercises should be done with a fixed weight rather than a variable weight such as a rubber band. Repetitions are emphasized, and a relatively light weight is used. Sometimes, sports-specific techniques are useful, particularly when strengthening the throwing motion, the serving motion or swimming motions. In addition, physical therapy modalities such as electrogalvanic stimulation, ultrasound treatment and transverse friction massages can also be helpful.

Therapeutic Injections Therapeutic injections are useful both because they are therapeutic and also because they can help the physician differentiate impingement from other problems. Indications for therapeutic injections include the following: Rotator cuff impingement that does not improve with conservative treatment, including NSAIDs and physical therapy. Some potential weakening of the tendon can occur with injection directly into the rotator cuff. We recommend using 8 to 9 mL of lidocaine, 1 percent, mixed with 20 mg of triamcinolone or a similar amount of methylprednisolone, 20 mg per mL, or betamethasone, 6 mg per mL. The large volume floods the rotator cuff surface. A 1. 5-in, 22-gauge needle usually works well.

### An update of systematic reviews examining the effectiveness of conservative physical therapy interventions for subacromial shoulder pain [^1163HFjy]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To update a systematic review published in 2013 that focused on evaluating the effectiveness of interventions within the scope of physical therapy, including exercise, manual therapy, electrotherapy, and combined or multimodal approaches to managing shoulder pain.

Design

Umbrella review.

Literature Search

An electronic search of PubMed, Web of Science, and CINAHL was undertaken. Methodological quality was assessed using the AMSTAR (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews) checklist for systematic reviews.

Study Selection Criteria

Nonsurgical treatments for subacromial shoulder pain.

Data Synthesis

Sixteen systematic reviews were retrieved. Results were summarized qualitatively.

Results

A strong recommendation can be made for exercise therapy as the first-line treatment to improve pain, mobility, and function in patients with subacromial shoulder pain. Manual therapy may be integrated, with a strong recommendation, as additional therapy. There was moderate evidence of no effect for other commonly prescribed interventions, such as laser therapy, extracorporeal shockwave therapy, pulsed electromagnetic energy, and ultrasound.

Conclusion

There is a growing body of evidence to support exercise therapy as an intervention for subacromial shoulder pain. Ongoing research is required to provide guidance on exercise type, dose, duration, and expected outcomes. A strong recommendation may be made regarding the inclusion of manual therapy in the initial treatment phase. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2020;50(3):131–141.

### Effectiveness of a sport-specific exercise programme for overhead athletes with unilateral subacromial shoulder pain: a study protocol of a randomised controlled trial [^117XFd7A]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Intervention groups

Scapular stability exercise programme

The standardised scapular stability intervention consists of four therapeutic exercises to enhance scapular control and shoulder complex strength. The programme includes external rotation exercises, horizontal abduction in side-lying and prone positions, and prone shoulder extension with dumbbells. Participants will complete 18 unsupervised sessions over 6 weeks, integrating these exercises into their warm-up routine at their regular CrossFit training facility. Each session will include three sets of 10 repetitions per exercise, with 60 s of rest between exercises and 90 s between sets, performed thrice weekly.

Sport-specific multimodal exercise programme

The sport-specific intervention follows the CERT (Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template) checklistand is tailored to improve mobility, strength and stability in sport-relevant movement patterns. This programme comprises seven exercises incorporating PVC pipes, barbells and resistance bands, emphasising glenohumeral mobility and activating the rotator cuff and periscapular muscles. Each exercise will be performed twice weekly during the warm-up routine at the athletes' usual CrossFit training centre. Participants will complete two sets of eight repetitions per exercise, with 60 s of rest between exercises and 90 s between sets, over 18 sessions across 6 weeks.

To ensure appropriate resistance progression, initial band resistance will be selected based on repetition maximum criteria, allowing athletes to perform 8–12 repetitions per set before reaching fatigue. An individualised progression algorithm based on pain response will be implemented (table 1). This programme aligns with the Bern Consensus, which recommends exercises be performed in sport-specific positions, incorporating multiple joints with minimal equipment, competitive elements and integration into warm-up and resistance training sessions for at least 10–5 min per session, with 5 min dedicated to shoulder-specific activities.

### Optimising outcomes of exercise and corticosteroid injection in patients with subacromial pain (impingement) syndrome: a factorial randomised trial [^113NSk4d]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Physiotherapist-led individualised, supervised and progressed exercise

The protocol for the physiotherapist-led exercise programme can be found at: The exercise programme was delivered by 20 community-based, musculoskeletal physiotherapists who completed a 2-day training workshop about the exercise treatment protocol. It commenced within 3 weeks of recruitment and injection. Exercise type and dose were individualised, supervised and progressed in 6–8 sessions over a period of 12–16 weeks. Exercises were progressed through three stages guided by an individualised written exercise sheet and a computerised package, aiming to support the patient back to their specific everyday physical, sporting and occupational activities:

Scapular stability exercise and active movement without resistance.
Range of movement exercises, isometrics and stretches, with scapular control in pain-free range.
Through-range resistance exercises, progressed to encourage rotator cuff muscle strengthening through all ranges of movement.

Treatment approaches included patient self-monitoring, goal setting and a written individualised home exercise programme. Non-attenders were offered up to two further appointments.

Advice and exercise leaflet

The leaflet was provided following corticosteroid injection and included information about shoulder anatomy and SAPS; simple self-help messages about analgesia, cold packs and activities; and six standardised specific strengthening and range of motion exercises to be performed 2–3 times daily, with no instructions for individualisation or progression.

Ultrasound-guided subacromial corticosteroid injection

Ultrasound-guided injections were performed by one of nine clinicians using the LOGIQ e system with a 12 MHz transducer. Clinicians either had extensive clinical experience performing ultrasound-guided injections or completed an accredited course on ultrasound-guided subacromial injections; all attended a half-day injection protocol workshop and passed a clinical competency test by a consultant musculoskeletal sonographer (AH). The skin and transducer were cleaned with chlorhexidine 0.5% solution and sterile gel applied to the transducer. The participant sat with the shoulder internally rotated and the ipsilateral hand on the buttock to maximise visibility of and access to the subacromial bursa. The transducer was placed anterolaterally, the hypoechoic subacromial bursa visualised, and a 21 G needle inserted under real-time ultrasound guidance until the needle-tip entered the bursa. A commercially available premixed solution of methylprednisolone 40 mg and 1 mL 1% lidocaine was injected into the bursa.

### Effectiveness of progressive and resisted and non-progressive or non-resisted exercise in rotator cuff related shoulder pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111yNpeb]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Synthesize evidence regarding effectiveness of progressive and resisted or non-progressive and non-resisted exercise compared with placebo or no treatment, in rotator cuff related pain.

Data Sources

English articles, searched in Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL databases up until May 19, 2020.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials in people with rotator cuff related pain comparing either progressive and resisted exercise or non-progressive and non-resisted exercise, with placebo or no treatment were included. Data extracted independently by two authors. Risk of bias appraised with the Cochrane Collaboration tool.

Results

Seven trials (468 participants) were included, four trials (271 participants) included progressive and resisted exercise and three trials (197 participants) included non-progressive or non-resisted exercise. There was uncertain clinical benefit for composite pain and function (15 point difference, 95% CI 9 to 21, 100-point scale) and pain outcomes at > 6weeks to 6months with progressive and resisted exercise compared to placebo or no treatment (comparison 1). For non-progressive or non-resisted exercise there was no significant benefit for composite pain and function (4 point difference, 95% CI -2 to 9, 100-point scale) and pain outcomes at > 6weeks to 6months compared to placebo or no treatment (comparison 2). Adverse events were seldom reported and mild.

Conclusions

There is uncertain clinical benefit for all outcomes with progressive and resisted exercise and no significant benefit with non-progressive and non-resisted exercise, versus no treatment or placebo at > 6weeks to 6months. Findings are low certainty and should be interpreted with caution.

### Progressive exercise compared with best practice advice, with or without corticosteroid injection, for the treatment of patients with rotator cuff disorders (GRASP): a multicentre, pragmatic, 2 × 2 factorial, randomised controlled trial [^1173PnZ9]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Randomisation and masking

Consented participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups: (1) progressive exercise programme (a progressive home exercise programme that was individually tailored and prescribed and supervised by a physiotherapist involving up to six face-to-face sessions over 16 weeks), (2) best practice advice (one face-to-face session with a physiotherapist and home exercise programme supported by high quality self-management materials); (3) progressive exercise programme preceded by a subacromial corticosteroid injection; or (4) best practice advice session preceded by a subacromial corticosteroid injection.

Randomisation (1:1:1:1) was done by an independent research facilitator using the centralised computer randomisation service provided by the Oxford Clinical Trials Research Unit once the patient was enrolled and baseline questionnaire completed. Randomisation was computer generated and stratified by site, age (18–35 years, > 35 years) and sex, using variable block sizes. We could not mask physiotherapists or study participants once treatment allocation was revealed. When practical, team members were masked until after data analysis was complete. Trial statisticians had access to treatment assignment during the study for the purposes of data monitoring and safety. Data entry personnel entered data from anonymised questionnaires, which included some details on treatments received.

Procedures

Subacromial corticosteroid injection was delivered before the progressive exercise or best practice advice intervention and given predominately by extended-scope physiotherapists with an appropriate post-registration qualification. Appointments were coordinated so that participants would receive their injection within 10 days of randomisation. In accordance with the trial protocol, the corticosteroid injected was either methylprednisolone acetate (≤ 40 mg) or triamcinolone acetonide (≤ 40 mg), as per local treatment protocols. The local anaesthetic was either 1.0% lidocaine (≤ 5 mL) or 0.5% bupivacaine hydrochloride (≤ 10 mL). The choice and dose of corticosteroid and local anaesthetic (including volume), including the injection site, was recorded for each participant. A second injection could be given after 6 weeks in accordance with the trial protocol for patients who received good initial benefit from their first injection. Because of existing evidence of the greater effectiveness of corticosteroid injection compared with placebo for short-term management, we excluded the use of placebo injection from our protocol. Full details of the exercise interventions have been reported previouslyand here described in brief.

Subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) represents a spectrum of pathology ranging from subacromial bursitis to rotator cuff tendinopathy and full-thickness rotator cuff tears. The relationship between subacromial impingement and rotator cuff disease in the etiology of rotator cuff injury is a matter of debate. Both extrinsic compression and intrinsic degeneration may play a role. Management includes physical therapy, injections, and, for some patients, surgery. There remains a need for high-quality studies of the pathology, etiology, and management of SIS.

### Early activation or a more protective regime after arthroscopic subacromial decompression – a description of clinical changes with two different physiotherapy treatment protocols – a prospective, randomized pilot study with a two-year follow-up [^115G7AQz]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To describe clinical changes with two protocols of physiotherapy following arthroscopic subacromial decompression (ASD) over two years. Reliability of Functional Index of the Shoulder was performed.

Design

A prospective, randomized pilot study, within-subject design.

Subjects

Thirty-four shoulders (13 women), mean age 46 (SD 7) years with primary shoulder impingement, listed for arthroscopic subacromial decompression.

Interventions

The traditional group (n = 20) started with active assisted range of motion exercises on the day of surgery, dynamic exercises for the rotator cuff after six weeks and strengthening exercises after eight weeks. The progressive group (n = 14) started active assisted range of motion and dynamic exercises for the rotator cuff on the day of surgery. Strengthening exercises started after six weeks.

Main Measures

A clinical evaluation was made preoperatively, six weeks, three, six, 12 and 24 months after surgery. Pain, patient satisfaction, active range of motion and muscular strength were evaluated. Shoulder function was evaluated using Constant score, Hand in neck, Pour out of a pot and Functional Index of the Shoulder.

Results

Both groups showed significant improvements in pain during activity and at rest, in range of motion in extension and abduction, in strength of external rotation and in function. There were no clinical differences in changes between groups. Most patients were pain-free from six months. After two years, the majority of patients achieved ≥ 160 degrees in flexion, ≥ 175 degrees in abduction and 80 degrees in external rotation, the traditional achieved 67 and the progressive group 87 with Constant score.

Conclusions

Early activation using a comprehensive, well-defined and controlled physiotherapy protocol can be used safely after arthroscopic subacromial decompression.

### Effectiveness of adding a large dose of shoulder strengthening to current nonoperative care for subacromial impingement: a pragmatic, double-blind randomized controlled trial (SExSI trial) [^115SVxft]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Interventions

Both groups received usual nonoperative care. Per clinical guidelines, this included the offer to be referred to general rehabilitation in a municipal clinic under the Danish Health Act §140 but also included any other nonoperative therapy.

Participants in the IG underwent the add-on intervention "Strengthen Your Shoulder", a home-based, progressive, high-volume resistance training program including 1 to 3 exercises performed with an elastic band as external resistance. The program consisted of 3 phases with a duration of 5 to 6 weeks each. For each new phase, 1 exercise was added and the exercise load increased. All exercises targeted the rotator cuff muscles and were continued until contraction failure (muscular exhaustion) to facilitate an optimized physiological response. The exercises were (1) external rotation with the elbow supported in approximately 45° of shoulder scaption, (2) abduction with a slight degree of scaption to approximately 45°, and (3) external rotation with the elbow unsupported in approximately 45° of scaption. The exercises were performed with slow dynamic contractions and a 5-second isometric component. This was done to increase the time that the muscle and tendon were under tension during the strengthening exercise (referred to as time under tension), which is related to greater subacute muscle protein synthesisand larger muscle strength gains. Using studies that have investigated exercise interventions for subacromial impingement, we estimated that the total prescribed time under tension for strengthening exercise aimed at the rotator cuff ranged from 2 hoursto 12 hoursover approximately 3 months. The rotator cuff exercises used in previous studies consisted of loaded external rotation and abduction. In the current study, the add-on intervention had a total prescribed time under tension of approximately 12 hours. As part of the intervention, we included a standard protocol for individualized adaptation of the exercise load based on the pain response and maximum number of repetitions (repetition maximum). Accordingly, participants were instructed to monitor the flare-up of symptoms after exercise and reduce the load if a flare-up lasted more than 24 hours. In case the maximum number of repetitions that a patient could perform was not within the repetition maximum range specified for an intervention phase (ie, 15–20 for phase 1), the patient was advised to adjust the load for the next exercise session. Supervised exercise instructions were provided at baseline and after 2, 5, and 10 weeks, with a final supervised instruction provided after the last follow-up (4 months) to allow participants to continue with the program should they wish to. A full description of the intervention, following the template for intervention description and replication (TIDieR) guidelines, and the rationale to support it are available via open access, and educational videos of the exercises are available at.

### Effect of specific exercise strategy on need for surgery in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome: randomised controlled study [^1163JbaG]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

The specific exercise group experienced a large treatment effect, illustrated by a mean change of 24 points in the primary outcome (Constant-Murley score) after three months. These results are comparable with the results reported by several authors one to two years after arthroscopic subacromial decompression surgery. Also the patients' global impression of change because of treatment reported by the specific exercise group (69% much improved or recovered) is comparable with the success rates reported by the patients one year after arthroscopic subacromial decompression (75%). The positive results of increased shoulder function and decreased pain are in line with earlier studies reporting a positive effect of exercise strategies. A study by Bennell et al that used a strategy including manual treatment, however, reported no immediate effect after treatment. As some recent systematic reviews have expressed concerns over the methods of the earlier studies, no consensus exists regarding exercise treatment in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome. The main concerns have been assessor blinding, small sample sizes, and insufficient descriptions of the exercise programmes, including dose and adherence to the exercise protocol. Furthermore, studies evaluating the efficacy of exercise treatment in patients with persistent subacromial impingement syndrome who are on the waiting list for surgery are scarce. Two pilot studies evaluated eccentric exercises for the rotator cuff and reported favourable results. About 60–70% of the patients withdrew from the waiting list. In the current study, an even higher percentage declined surgery (80% of the patients in the specific exercise group). Virta et al reported that only 10 of 97 patients needed surgery after 12 weeks of strengthening exercises. Their study design, however, lacked a control group. Dickens et al evaluated physiotherapy for patients on the waiting list for surgery, reporting that 26% of the patients in the intervention group withdrew from the waiting list, whereas all in the control group required surgery. Because their exercise programme was not standardised and the content, dose, and progression were not described in detail, however, the results cannot be compared with ours. Other studies have compared exercise treatment with surgery and reported similar positive outcomes after 12 months. All these studies successfully used the supervised regimen by Bohmer et aland have contributed to the recommendation that exercises are used as first line management. The current study evaluating a new strategy for patients in whom earlier exercise treatments have failed adds valuable knowledge for managing patients with persistent subacromial impingement syndrome.

Introduction

Subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) is the most common diagnostic label for shoulder pain. Neer defined SIS as mechanical shoulder dysfunction causing mechanical stress to the rotator cuff tendons and/or the long head of the biceps tendon in the subacromial space. However, this pathoanatomic model is now controversial because recent evidence suggests that it does not fully explain the mechanisms related to SIS.

SIS has been found to be associated with biomechanical factors, such as alterations in glenohumeral and scapulohumeral kinematics, and impairment of the rotator cuff and the scapular muscles. Electromyographic studies of the intensity and timing of muscle activity of the shoulder muscles in people with SIS have found increased upper trapezius activity with reduced serratus anterior and inferior trapezius activity, associated with a delay in the activation time of these latter two muscles. At the glenohumeral level, the activity and coactivation of the rotator cuff muscles, especially the infraspinatus and subscapularis, was found to be reduced during the first phase of arm elevation.

These findings led to a change in the approach to physiotherapy for SIS, with the new focus on biomechanical or movement-related mechanisms. Exercise programmes for the treatment of SIS frequently include different types of exercises, such as scapular stabilisation exercises, resistance exercises for the rotator cuff muscles, exercises to improve range of motion and stretching. However, no particular type of exercise protocol has emerged as a reference for the non-surgical treatment of SIS. A consensus decision algorithm for physical therapists based on clinical reasoning for the assessment and treatment of people with shoulder pain has been proposed. In this algorithm, the type of exercises are determined from the clinical findings and not the structural pathology, and specific exercises are the fundamental basis of the treatment. The exercises are performed according to the following principles: the exercises should not produce pain, they should selectively activate weak muscles without activating overactive muscles and they should be performed in a graduated manner with appropriate scapulohumeral coordination and humeral head alignment. Several clinical trials have evaluated the effectiveness of this specific exercise programme in people with SIS.

Specific exercise group

The programme was based on the latest scientific literatureand clinical experience and focused on strengthening eccentric exercises for the rotator cuff and strengthening concentric/eccentric exercises for the scapula stabilisers. The programme consisted of six different exercises: two eccentric exercises for the rotator cuff (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor), three concentric/eccentric exercises for the scapula stabilisers (middle and lower trapezius, rhomboideus, and serratus anterior), and a posterior shoulder stretch. Each strengthening exercise was repeated 15 times in three sets twice daily for eight weeks. The posterior shoulder stretch was performed for 30–60 seconds and repeated three times twice daily. From week eight to week 12, the exercises were repeated once a day. The exercises were individually adjusted and progressed with increased external load by using weights and elastic rubber band at the physiotherapist visits once every other week during the whole rehabilitation period. When necessary, the physiotherapist performed manual treatment by stretching the posterior glenohumeral capsule and pectoralis minor during the visits. The pain monitoring modelwas used to find the individual resistance for each patient. The patients were not allowed to exceed 5 on this 0–10 scale when they performed the exercises; however, they were recommended to feel some pain during loading. After completion of an exercise session, increased pain had to revert to levels before exercise before the next session; otherwise, the external load was decreased. Great emphasis was placed on teaching good posture (thoracic spine extension and retracted shoulders) and to maintain this position during the exercises. After completion of the specific exercise programme (after 12 weeks), we recommended participants to maintain the daily home exercises for another two months. A more detailed description of the exercise programme can be found in the appendix on bmj.com.

Control exercise group

The control exercise programme consisted of six unspecific movement exercises for the neck and shoulder without any external load (shoulder abduction in the frontal plane, shoulder retraction, shoulder elevation, neck retraction, stretch of upper trapezius and pectoralis major. Each movement exercise was repeated 10 times, and each stretching exercise three times twice daily at home and once every other week at the physiotherapist visits. The patients did the same programme without any progression during the whole rehabilitation period. The unspecific exercise programme was thought to have a limited effect in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome and therefore acted as a control.

Operative Intervention and Postoperative Rehabilitation

Participants randomized to the operative group of the study undergo rotator cuff surgery and then follow a standardized postoperative rehabilitation program. Surgery includes a rotator cuff repair and/or debridement based on an evidence-based surgical protocol (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 2) developed for this trial. Surgery is done almost exclusively on an arthroscopic basis unless the operating surgeon determines on the basis of intraoperative or perioperative factors that an open procedure is required. Information is collected on the specific surgical techniques used, such as number of anchors and type of repair (eg, single row, double row, transosseous, or transtendinous). Any concomitant procedures that are performed, such as subacromial decompression and acromioclavicular joint resection, are also noted. The operating surgeon determines whether a patient may need concomitant or alternate shoulder surgical procedures. The recruiting surgeon completes a standardized postsurgery report form noting details of the surgery and intraoperative observations of tear size, location, and shape; tendon quality and retraction; and cuff repair performed.

After surgery, participants follow a prescribed physical therapy and home exercise program. A standardized, postoperative rehabilitation protocol (eAppendix 3 in Supplement 2) has been developed for this trial with extensive input from our team of clinicians, researchers, and expert consultants. The duration of the postoperative physical therapy program is approximately 4 months, with participants attending physical therapy 1 to 2 times a week, for a total of approximately 16 to 32 visits. Participants are encouraged to perform exercises at home with a dosing of therapy (physical therapy and/or home exercises) of approximately 4 times per week. The treatment stages of the postoperative rehabilitation protocol are linked to specific time frames after surgery. Participants in the operative group who meet treatment goals for a given stage early are not advanced to the next stage ahead of schedule, to allow proper healing of their shoulder postoperatively. Participants perform a home exercise program during their postoperative rehabilitation program and may continue physical therapy beyond 4 months as prescribed or as deemed appropriate by their treating clinicians.

Potential Risks From Intervention

Both the operative and nonoperative treatments in this trial are standards of usual care. The adverse events and serious adverse events are therefore those inherent to standard-of-care treatments. Adverse events for this trial include postoperative infection, postoperative bleeding, thromboembolism, nerve injury, complications due to anesthesia, and adhesive capsulitis. Serious adverse events include death and an event requiring hospitalization (in-patient admission) related to the treatment.

### Specific versus general exercise programme in adults with subacromial impingement syndrome: a randomised controlled trial [^116882iS]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Randomisation and blinding

Two coordinating researchers were responsible for managing the entire process of each participant from inclusion until the end of the exercise programmes. They were blinded to the allocated intervention and treatment provided by the treating physiotherapists. One of the coordinating researchers (JV-F) was responsible for enrolling the participants in the study, verifying that they met the eligibility criteria. Another of the coordinating researchers (HJGE) was responsible for generating the randomisation sequence: eligible participants were randomly assigned to participate in a specific or general exercises programme using a validated web-based randomisation programme (Sortition). The randomisation method was in blocks with randomly selected block sizes of four participants.

The group to which each participant was assigned was kept in a sealed envelope with the objective of concealing the assignment from the researcher who decided the entry of the participants in the study. Given the nature of the therapeutic interventions studied, blinding of the treating physiotherapists and participants was not possible; however, the evaluators and statistician were blinded to group allocation. Two external evaluators performed a clinical examination before and after the exercise programmes, they were blinded to the treatment provided by the treating physiotherapist.

Intervention

Participants continued to receive their usual care throughout the trial as prescribed by their physician; 500 mg of oral naproxen two times per day for 14 days and a supervised home exercise programme. The usual care and the experimental and control interventions were delivered by two physiotherapists with a master's degree in manual therapy and more than 15 years of experience in musculoskeletal physiotherapy. Both physiotherapists were external to the research team; they never expressed their predilection for one treatment or another to the participants.

The usual care included a session of advice during which individuals were taught an exercise programme to perform at home. The programme consisted of four exercises for the neck and shoulder with no external load: pain-free active movements of shoulder elevation, shoulder retraction, shoulder abduction in the scapular plane and neck retraction. Each exercise was repeated 10 times, 2 times per day at home. To promote adherence to the home exercise programme, the participants reviewed the exercise programme with the physiotherapist once a week. Additionally, adherence and adverse events were monitored during a weekly phone call by a physiotherapist and recorded in the data collection notebook of each participant.

### Exercise therapy for bone and muscle health: an overview of systematic reviews [^112vCaXQ]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Shoulder pain

SP and shoulder disorders cover a broad spectrum of pain, symptoms, and diagnoses, including tendonitis, rotator-cuff disease, sub-acromial pain, impingement syndrome, and repetitive strain injury. As with NP, there is no general agreement on the classification of painful shoulder conditions. Clinically, patients often present with SP together with stiffness, reduced range of motion, and/or with pain, or other symptoms radiating to the more proximal part of the arm.

Marinko et al. included three studies on SP with pain as an outcome, and compared the effects of exercise versus other treatments on pain levels. Data were pooled by use of a random-effects model, which showed an overall SMD in favor of the exercise intervention (SMD -0.30; 95% CI -0.48 to -0.12). Four studies included function as an outcome, and compared the effect of exercise versus an alternative intervention or no intervention. Data were pooled by use of a random-effects model, with an overall SMD of 0.15 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.29), indicating a minimal positive effect over no care or alternative interventions. We were not able to identify any reviews exploring between-trial heterogeneity or the effect of exercise on pathogenesis.

We identified 7 key themes for advice and education: exercise intensity and pain response, activity modification advice, posture advice, pain self-management advice, pathoanatomical and diagnosis information, behavioral approaches, and pain biology advice.

Conclusion

While advice focused predominantly on the local tissue pathology model, 10% of studies included information about pain neuroscience education, psychosocial factors, motor imagery, or behavior change. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2020;50(6):285–293. doi:10.2519/jospt.2020.9152.

### Effectiveness of adding a large dose of shoulder strengthening to current nonoperative care for subacromial impingement: a pragmatic, double-blind randomized controlled trial (SExSI trial) [^113LCdG9]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The overall response to nonoperative care found in both groups in the present study seems slightly better than what was reported in a recent nationwide study including 3306 patients diagnosed with subacromial impingement in a specialist care setting (similar to the current study), as only 43%, compared with 51% in the present study, reached an acceptable symptom state at 4-month follow-up. This is despite the fact that 87% had engaged in exercise therapy as part of their treatment. Such slightly better outcomes in trial settings is to be expected and likely a consequence of well-known trial effects. Hence, it is not surprising that the overall response in our trial is in accordance with another effectiveness trial by Roddy et alon nonoperative care (including rotator cuff strengthening) conducted in a comparable population. Accordingly, Roddy et al found similar within-group differences in the SPADI score, with a large improvement after 6 weeks and only minimal changes after this, using somewhat different strengthening exercises than the add-on intervention utilized in the present study. It therefore seems unlikely that slight differences in shoulder muscle-strengthening exercises alter the effectiveness of this type of exercise intervention to any important degree. Moreover, the fact that such a large group of patients (about half), who all underwent exercise as first-line treatment, did not achieve an acceptable result from current nonoperative care questions the recent strong BMJ recommendation against surgery for subacromial impingement. By rigidly discouraging surgery, we risk leaving a large group of patients, who do not benefit from exercise therapy, with no further treatment options in the orthodox health care system. Along these lines, it is worth noting that recent knowledge indicates a short-term effect of interventions including surgery for subacromial impingement when used as part of a second-line treatment approach. In the study by Cederqvist et al, patients were first prescribed a 3- to 4-month physical therapist−led exercise intervention, and patients who failed this approach were randomized to either continuation of the previously initiated rehabilitation program or a surgical intervention. At 3 months after randomization, between-group differences in improvements were in favor of the surgery group, with differences of 10 to 15 points on the VAS. These findings provide preliminary evidence that surgery might provide some short-term benefit for patients who fail to achieve a successful outcome from initial nonoperative care, but further large-scale studies are needed to inform future decisions on whether surgery still has a place in secondary care for subacromial impingement.

### Exercise in the treatment of rotator cuff impingement: a systematic review and a synthesized evidence-based rehabilitation protocol [^112DddDk]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

A systematic review of the literature was performed to evaluate the role of exercise in treating rotator cuff impingement and to synthesize a standard evidence-based rehabilitation protocol. Eleven randomized, controlled trials (level 1 and 2) evaluating the effect of exercise in the treatment of impingement were identified. Data regarding demographics, methodology, and outcomes of pain, range of motion, strength, and function were recorded. Individual components of each rehabilitation program were catalogued. Effectiveness was determined by statistical and clinical significance. Although many articles had methodologic concerns, the data demonstrate that exercise has statistically and clinically significant effects on pain reduction and improving function, but not on range of motion or strength. Manual therapy augments the effects of exercise, yet supervised exercise was not different than home exercise programs. Information regarding specific components of the exercise programs was synthesized into a gold standard rehabilitation protocol for future studies on the nonoperative treatment of rotator cuff impingement.

### Subacromial decompression versus diagnostic arthroscopy for shoulder impingement: a 5-year follow-up of a randomised, placebo surgery controlled clinical trial [^1116bpkd]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study intervention

Exercise therapy

A physiotherapist supervised, progressive, individually designed exercise therapy was started within 2 weeks of randomisation. Participants completed 15 visits to physiotherapists and a standardised home exercise protocol (the detailed exercise therapy protocol is available in online supplementary appendix). All study physiotherapists supervising the exercise therapy were specially trained to conduct our protocol.

Diagnostic arthroscopy

We carried out arthroscopic examination of the glenohumeral joint and subacromial space with the use of standard posterior and lateral portals and a 4 mm arthroscope with the participant under general anaesthesia, usually supplemented with an interscalene brachial plexus block. We performed an intra-articular and subacromial assessment of the rotator cuff integrity. If the rotator cuff insertion could not be otherwise visualised, the subacromial bursal tissue was bluntly stretched with a trochar or minimally resected. If arthroscopic examination revealed any pathology requiring intervention other than ASD, the patient was excluded from the trial (figure 1). Once eligibility was confirmed, participants were randomly assigned to either ASD or diagnostic arthroscopy. For those allocated to the diagnostic arthroscopy group, the operation was terminated. To ensure concealment of the allocation from participants and the staff other than those in the operating theatre, the diagnostic arthroscopy participants remained in the operating theatre for the time required to perform subacromial decompression.

Arthroscopic subacromial decompression

For patients allocated to ASD after diagnostic arthroscopy, we continued the surgery by performing a standard ASD procedure — a subacromial bursectomy and resection of bony spurs and the projecting anterolateral undersurface of the acromion with a shaver, burr and/or electrocoagulation.

Postoperative rehabilitation

In the surgically treated patients (ASD and diagnostic arthroscopy groups), postoperative rehabilitation was identical. It consisted one outpatient visit to a study physiotherapist, blind to the group assignment, for guidance and instructions for home exercises.

Discussion

Summary of findings

This is the largest trial of exercise and injection interventions to treat SAPS. Physiotherapist-led, individualised, supervised and progressed exercise produced greater improvements in pain and function than providing a standard advice and exercise leaflet. The between-group difference at 6 months was no longer significant by 12 months when exercise adherence had reduced. Ultrasound guidance provided no additional benefit over unguided injection other than perceived emotional effect of shoulder pain at 6 weeks and lower work presenteeism at 12 months.

Interpretation: What this study adds for clinicians who treat shoulder pain

We provide further evidence of medium-term beneficial effects of physiotherapist-led exercise for SAPS adding to previous trials reporting short-term improvements. While the optimal content and duration of exercise remain uncertain, we demonstrate that an individualised, supervised and progressed exercise programme focusing on scapular stability, range of motion and rotator cuff strengthening, is clinically effective. Potential explanations for its effectiveness include the key characteristics of the programme (individualisation, supervision and progression of exercises by physiotherapists over several sessions coupled with an individualised and progressed home exercise programme); the focus on shoulder stability, movement control and rotator cuff strength; high exercise adherence rates; and/or the contact and attention of the physiotherapist over several face-to-face treatment sessions. For example, in the physiotherapy-led exercise group, the mean number of physiotherapist sessions attended was six, with 86% reporting performing exercises at least once daily at 6 weeks compared with 64% in the leaflet group. Only 56% of participants received 6–8 sessions as per protocol, yet our results highlight the benefits of physiotherapist-led exercise for SAPS. Few randomised trials have compared physiotherapist-led exercise with self-exercise, finding no difference between treatments, although the trials are small and follow-up short.

### Subacromial impingement syndrome – effectiveness of physiotherapy and manual therapy [^1171258t]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) includes the rotator cuff syndrome, tendonitis and bursitis of the shoulder. Treatment includes surgical and non-surgical modalities. Non-surgical treatment is used to reduce pain, to decrease the subacromial inflammation, to heal the compromised rotator cuff and to restore satisfactory function of the shoulder. To select the most appropriate non-surgical intervention and to identify gaps in scientific knowledge, we explored the effectiveness of the interventions used, concentrating on the effectiveness of physiotherapy and manual therapy.

Methods

The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, PEDro and CINAHL were searched for relevant systematic reviews and randomised clinical trials (RCTs). Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality. A best-evidence synthesis was used to summarise the results.

Results

Two reviews and 10 RCTs were included. One RCT studied manual therapy as an add-on therapy to self-training. All other studies studied the effect of physiotherapy: effectiveness of exercise therapy, mobilisation as an add-on therapy to exercises, ultrasound, laser and pulsed electromagnetic field. Moderate evidence was found for the effectiveness of hyperthermia compared to exercise therapy or ultrasound in the short term. Hyperthermia and exercise therapy were more effective in comparison to controls or placebo in the short term (moderate evidence). For the effectiveness of hyperthermia, no midterm or long-term results were studied. In the midterm, exercise therapy gave the best results (moderate evidence) compared to placebo or controls. For other interventions, conflicting, limited or no evidence was found.

Conclusions

Some physiotherapeutic treatments seem to be promising (moderate evidence) to treat SIS, but more research is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.

Statistical analysis

The target sample size was 704 participants, based on 90% power to detect a minimally clinically important between-group difference of 8 points on the SPADI total scale, assuming a baseline SD of 24.3. This difference is equivalent to a standardised effect size of 0.33, which required a sample size of 550 participants. NCSS was used to calculate sample size. Allowing for a potential loss to follow-up at 12 months of 20% increased the sample size to 688 participants. We further increased the sample size to 704 participants to take into account the potential for a small clustering effect by physiotherapist (interclass correlation 0.001). The sample size assumed no interaction effect and was powered for the two main-effect comparisons: (1) progressive exercise versus best practice advice to investigate the effects of progressive exercise and (2) subacromial corticosteroid injection versus no injection to investigate the effects of corticosteroid injection. This number of participants provided 80% power and 5% significance to detect an interaction with a standardised effect size of 0.35 or more, if an interaction effect did exist.

All analyses were on an intention-to-treat basis unless specified as otherwise. The presence of an interaction effect was assessed before testing the intervention effects on the primary outcome. The difference in SPADI between intervention groups was estimated over the 12-month period and at each data collection timepoint using a repeated-measures linear mixed-effects regression model adjusted for the fixed-effects age, sex, and baseline SPADI, and random intercepts by centre, physiotherapist, and observations within participant. In the SAP, we clarified prespecification of the primary outcome measure as being over 12 months, not at 12 months, as described in the protocol. This prespecification of the primary outcome measure better reflects the planned method of analysis described in the protocol, which used a linear mixed longitudinal model. The data monitoring and ethics committee approved the SAP before the analysis was done and provided a blinded review of the sample size assumptions after 338 participants were recruited and no changes were made to the final sample size. Prespecified subgroup analyses included age (≥ 65 years), sex, smoking status, increased baseline SPADI score (≥ 50), and increased baseline pain self-efficacy score (≥ 8). Secondary outcomes were analysed using the same methods as the primary outcome.

### Optimising outcomes of exercise and corticosteroid injection in patients with subacromial pain (impingement) syndrome: a factorial randomised trial [^112H4N6n]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Shoulder pain is an important cause of disability, affecting one in five adults. Half of cases are due to subacromial pain (formerly impingement) syndrome (SAPS). Treatment guidelines recommend non-surgical management as the mainstay including education/self-management advice, exercise, corticosteroid injection and analgesia.

Exercise is thought to reduce SAPS-related pain and disability by addressing posture, muscle (including rotator cuff) weakness, scapular stability and impaired scapulohumeral rhythm, but trials are often small, of poor methodological quality and include only short-term follow-up. Supervised, progressed shoulder exercises are effective in the short term but the optimum type, intensity and duration are unknown. A systematic review of contextual factors associated with outcome concluded that physiotherapists should be involved in the design and delivery of exercise programme for SAPS.SAPS is commonly treated with corticosteroid injections although their efficacy is debated. Poor response to injection has been attributed to inaccurate placement of the injection, among other factors. Ultrasound guidance might improve accuracy, but small randomised trials have not consistently confirmed the superiority of ultrasound-guided injection over unguided injection in patients with SAPS.

The SUbacromial imPingement syndrome and Pain: a randomised controlled trial Of exeRcise and injecTion trial aimed to assess whether greater improvements in pain and function were obtained with (1) a physiotherapist led, individualised, supervised and progressed exercise programme versus a standardised advice and exercise leaflet, and (2) ultrasound-guided subacromial corticosteroid injection versus unguided injection.

### Progressive exercise compared with best practice advice, with or without corticosteroid injection, for the treatment of patients with rotator cuff disorders (GRASP): a multicentre, pragmatic, 2 × 2 factorial, randomised controlled trial [^112moWqG]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Participants randomly assigned to the progressive exercise intervention received up to six individual face-to-face sessions with a physiotherapist over 16 weeks. These sessions included a behavioural component to encourage adherence to the exercises. We chose the number of sessions, spread over this time, to enable progression of the intensity of exercise and a sufficient time for a physiological response in the neuromuscular system. Appointments were coordinated so that participants would start their first session within 14–28 days of randomisation. The initial session allowed up to 60 min for an initial examination of the shoulder and initial prescription of exercises. Thereafter, patients received up to five sessions, each 20–30 min, for the physiotherapist to progress or regress the exercise prescription using a standardised protocol. Exercises focused on movements commonly affected by a rotator cuff disorder: resisted external rotation, flexion, and abduction of the shoulder. Participants were given a folder containing an advice booklet, exercise action planner, diary, and instructions on their exercise programme set up in collaboration with the physiotherapist. Resistance bands were issued as required. Participants were asked to do their exercises 5 days per week, with two non-consecutive recovery days. Physiotherapists recorded the number of treatment sessions attended by each participant. The intervention was designed to support participants through a progressive dose of exercises and to optimise adherence to the home exercise plan.

Participants randomly assigned to the best practice advice intervention received a single individual face-to-face session with a physiotherapist, lasting up to 60 min. As per the progressive exercise intervention, appointments were coordinated so that participants would attend their session within 14–28 days of randomisation. Participants also received the same initial shoulder examination and advice booklet (with exercise action planner, diary, and resistance band) but the exercise programme was different. Participants were given a simple set of self-guided exercises (with access to exercise videos) that could be progressed and regressed depending on their capability. The exercises were designed using similar concepts to the progressive exercise intervention, such as increased resistance and done five times per week, but these were a simpler range of exercise options that were not supervised.

Physiotherapists delivering progressive exercise and best practice advice were trained separately by a GRASP trial research physiotherapist and had access to a comprehensive intervention manual. A rigorous quality control programme was done to ensure intervention fidelity.

### Electrotherapy modalities for rotator cuff disease [^112BUCc5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Management of rotator cuff disease may include use of electrotherapy modalities (also known as electrophysical agents), which aim to reduce pain and improve function via an increase in energy (electrical, sound, light, or thermal) into the body. Examples include therapeutic ultrasound, low-level laser therapy (LLLT), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMF). These modalities are usually delivered as components of a physical therapy intervention. This review is one of a series of reviews that form an update of the Cochrane review, 'Physiotherapy interventions for shoulder pain'.

Objectives

To synthesise available evidence regarding the benefits and harms of electrotherapy modalities for the treatment of people with rotator cuff disease.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 3), Ovid MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2015), Ovid EMBASE (January 1980 to March 2015), CINAHL Plus (EBSCOhost, January 1937 to March 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP clinical trials registries up to March 2015, unrestricted by language, and reviewed the reference lists of review articles and retrieved trials, to identify potentially relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials, including adults with rotator cuff disease (e.g. subacromial impingement syndrome, rotator cuff tendinitis, calcific tendinitis), and comparing any electrotherapy modality with placebo, no intervention, a different electrotherapy modality or any other intervention (e.g. glucocorticoid injection). Trials investigating whether electrotherapy modalities were more effective than placebo or no treatment, or were an effective addition to another physical therapy intervention (e.g. manual therapy or exercise) were the main comparisons of interest. Main outcomes of interest were overall pain, function, pain on motion, patient-reported global assessment of treatment success, quality of life and the number of participants experiencing adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted the data, performed a risk of bias assessment and assessed the quality of the body of evidence for the main outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 47 trials (2388 participants). Most trials (n = 43) included participants with rotator cuff disease without calcification (four trials included people with calcific tendinitis). Sixteen (34%) trials investigated the effect of an electrotherapy modality delivered in isolation. Only 23% were rated at low risk of allocation bias, and 49% were rated at low risk of both performance and detection bias (for self-reported outcomes). The trials were heterogeneous in terms of population, intervention and comparator, so none of the data could be combined in a meta-analysis. In one trial (61 participants; low quality evidence), pulsed therapeutic ultrasound (three to five times a week for six weeks) was compared with placebo (inactive ultrasound therapy) for calcific tendinitis. At six weeks, the mean reduction in overall pain with placebo was -6.3 points on a 52-point scale, and -14.9 points with ultrasound (MD -8.60 points, 95% CI -13.48 to -3.72 points; absolute risk difference 17%, 7% to 26% more). Mean improvement in function with placebo was 3.7 points on a 100-point scale, and 17.8 points with ultrasound (mean difference (MD) 14.10 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.39 to 22.81 points; absolute risk difference 14%, 5% to 23% more). Ninety-one per cent (29/32) of participants reported treatment success with ultrasound compared with 52% (15/29) of participants receiving placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.75, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.53; absolute risk difference 39%, 18% to 60% more). Mean improvement in quality of life with placebo was 0.40 points on a 10-point scale, and 2.60 points with ultrasound (MD 2.20 points, 95% CI 0.91 points to 3.49 points; absolute risk difference 22%, 9% to 35% more). Between-group differences were not important at nine months. No participant reported adverse events. Therapeutic ultrasound produced no clinically important additional benefits when combined with other physical therapy interventions (eight clinically heterogeneous trials, low quality evidence). We are uncertain whether there are differences in patient-important outcomes between ultrasound and other active interventions (manual therapy, acupuncture, glucocorticoid injection, glucocorticoid injection plus oral tolmetin sodium, or exercise) because the quality of evidence is very low. Two placebo-controlled trials reported results favouring LLLT up to three weeks (low quality evidence), however combining LLLT with other physical therapy interventions produced few additional benefits (10 clinically heterogeneous trials, low quality evidence). We are uncertain whether transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is more or less effective than glucocorticoid injection with respect to pain, function, global treatment success and active range of motion because of the very low quality evidence from a single trial. In other single, small trials, no clinically important benefits of pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMF), microcurrent electrical stimulation (MENS), acetic acid iontophoresis and microwave diathermy were observed (low or very low quality evidence). No adverse events of therapeutic ultrasound, LLLT, TENS or microwave diathermy were reported by any participants. Adverse events were not measured in any trials investigating the effects of PEMF, MENS or acetic acid iontophoresis.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on low quality evidence, therapeutic ultrasound may have short-term benefits over placebo in people with calcific tendinitis, and LLLT may have short-term benefits over placebo in people with rotator cuff disease. Further high quality placebo-controlled trials are needed to confirm these results. In contrast, based on low quality evidence, PEMF may not provide clinically relevant benefits over placebo, and therapeutic ultrasound, LLLT and PEMF may not provide additional benefits when combined with other physical therapy interventions. We are uncertain whether TENS is superior to placebo, and whether any electrotherapy modality provides benefits over other active interventions (e.g. glucocorticoid injection) because of the very low quality of the evidence. Practitioners should communicate the uncertainty of these effects and consider other approaches or combinations of treatment. Further trials of electrotherapy modalities for rotator cuff disease should be based upon a strong rationale and consideration of whether or not they would alter the conclusions of this review.

### Progressive exercise compared with best practice advice, with or without corticosteroid injection, for the treatment of patients with rotator cuff disorders (GRASP): a multicentre, pragmatic, 2 × 2 factorial, randomised controlled trial [^117RhWd2]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Figure 2
Marginal adjusted mean SPADI scores from baseline to 12 months

Results are from the repeated measures mixed-effects model. Figure shows progressive exercise (A) and injection (B). Error bars represent 99% CIs. SPADI = Shoulder Pain and Disability Index.

Table 4 presents the adjusted analysis results for each of the secondary outcomes (unadjusted results are provided in the appendix [pp 9–10]). We found no evidence of a difference between progressive exercise and best practice advice for secondary outcome measures, other than improvements in patient-reported global impression of treatment for progressive exercise over 12 months, at 6 months, and at 12 months timepoints. We found no evidence of a difference between corticosteroid injection and no injection for secondary outcome measures, except for at 8 weeks, when injection resulted in an improvement in shoulder pain, shoulder function, health-related quality of life, sleep disturbance, return to desired activities, and global impression of treatment (table 4).

Table 4
Adjusted mean differences for secondary outcomes for best practice advice vs progressive exercise and injection vs no injection

We found no difference in prespecified subgroup analyses over 12 months for the primary outcome, with the exception of corticosteroid injection, in which the effect was stronger at 8 weeks in participants with a higher baseline SPADI score (adjusted MD −9.67 [99% CI −15.37 to −3.97]), compared with those who received the injection but had a lower baseline SPADI score (−0.36 [–6.87 to 6.16]; appendix pp 13–18). No serious adverse events were reported. Three participants reported undergoing surgery to repair rotator cuff tear (n = 1; injection plus progressive exercise), frozen shoulder that developed after randomisation (n = 1; best practice advice), and subacromial decompression and repair of rotator cuff tear (n = 1; injection plus best practice advice).

### Level of pain catastrophising determines if patients with long-standing subacromial impingement benefit from more resistance exercise: predefined secondary analyses from a pragmatic randomised controlled trial (the SExSI trial) [^114RZyCg]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Interventions

Both groups received usual non-operative care — including the offer to be referred to free-of-charge general rehabilitation in a municipal clinic. In addition, participants in the IG received an add-on intervention of progressive, high-volume resistance exercise. The intervention was split in three phases of 5–6 weeks each. For each new phase, one exercise was added, and the exercise load increased. All exercises were performed unilaterally and targeted the rotator-cuff muscles through loaded external rotation and/or abduction, and were continued to contraction failure (muscular exhaustion) to facilitate an optimised physiological response. The intervention started with exercises at low relative resistance but high volume (three sets per session, every day) and was designed to produce a large total time-under-tension, i.e. the time that muscle and tendon is under tension during the resistance exercise. We instructed patients in the use of a pro- and regression algorithm, developed specifically for this study. The algorithm provides simple strategies to self-monitor symptom-response and take action when needed — using elements of pain neuroscience education. Accordingly, patients were taught that pain during exercise is not a sign of immediate danger and should be tolerated, as long as it is bearable. They were also instructed to stop the intervention if they had a flare-up lasting more than 24 hours, and to resume the intervention with lower resistance once the flare-up had settled. We did this to prepare patients for a time-contingent approach (i.e. not stopping exercise because of pain), by reducing fear of pain related to the intervention. Pro- and regression of external exercise resistance was further based on the repetition maximum (RM) principle, as described in the trial protocol. Supervised exercise instructions were provided at baseline and after 2, 5 and 10 weeks. A full description of the intervention, following the TIDieR checklist and guide, and the rationale to support it is available open access, and educational videos of the exercises are available from.

### Calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff: management options [^112zdczF]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff tendons is a common cause of shoulder pain in adults and typically presents as activity-related shoulder pain. It is thought to be an active, cell-mediated process, although the exact pathophysiology remains unclear. Nonsurgical management continues to be the mainstay of treatment; most patients improve with modalities such as oral anti-inflammatory medication, physical therapy, and corticosteroid injections. Several options are available for patients who fail nonsurgical treatment, including extracorporeal shock wave therapy, ultrasound-guided needle lavage, and surgical débridement. These modalities alleviate pain by eliminating the calcific deposit, and several recent studies have demonstrated success with the use of these treatment options. Surgical management options include arthroscopic procedures to remove calcific deposits and subacromial decompression; however, the role of subacromial decompression and repair of rotator cuff defects created by removing these deposits remains controversial.

### Exercise therapy is effective for improvement in range of motion, function, and pain in patients with frozen shoulder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Ak9se]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective(S)

To determine (1) the effect of exercise therapy alone or in combination with other interventions compared with solely exercises and programs with or without exercises and (2) what kind of exercise therapy or combination with other interventions is most effective.

Data Sources

PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.

Study Selection

Studies were screened in a 2-phase approach by 2 independent reviewers (M.M. and L.M.). Reference lists of included studies and interesting systematic reviews were hand searched.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers (M.M. and L.M.) extracted information about origin, characteristics of study participants, eligibility criteria, characteristics of interventions, outcome measures and main results in a pre-defined template.

Data Synthesis

Thirty-three studies were included in the qualitative and 19 in the meta-analysis. Preliminary evidence was found for supervised exercises to be more beneficial than home exercises for ROM and function. Multimodal programs comprising exercises may result in little to no difference in ROM compared to solely exercises. Programs comprising muscle energy techniques show little to no difference in ROM when compared with programs with other exercises. Adding stretches to a multimodal program with exercises may increase ROM. There is uncertain evidence that there is a difference between those programs regarding function and pain. Preliminary evidence was found for several treatment programs including exercises to be beneficial for improvement in both passive and active ROM, function, pain, and muscle strength. No studies used patient satisfaction as an outcome measure.

Conclusions

ROM, function, and pain improve with both solely exercises and programs with exercises, but for ROM and pain there was little to no difference between programs and for function the evidence was uncertain. Adding exercises improve active ROM compared with a program without exercises, whereas adding physical modalities has no beneficial effect. Muscle energy techniques are a beneficial type of exercise therapy for improving function compared with other types of exercise. Unfortunately, no conclusion can be drawn about the results in the long-term and most effective dose of exercise therapy.

### Progressive exercise compared with best practice advice, with or without corticosteroid injection, for the treatment of patients with rotator cuff disorders (GRASP): a multicentre, pragmatic, 2 × 2 factorial, randomised controlled trial [^112nuQLW]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Corticosteroid injections and physiotherapy exercise programmes are commonly used to treat rotator cuff disorders but the treatments' effectiveness is uncertain. We aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a progressive exercise programme with a single session of best practice physiotherapy advice, with or without corticosteroid injection, in adults with a rotator cuff disorder.

Methods

In this pragmatic, multicentre, superiority, randomised controlled trial (2×2 factorial), we recruited patients from 20 UK National Health Service trusts. We included patients aged 18 years or older with a rotator cuff disorder (new episode within the past 6 months). Patients were excluded if they had a history of significant shoulder trauma (eg, dislocation, fracture, or full-thickness tear requiring surgery), neurological disease affecting the shoulder, other shoulder conditions (eg, inflammatory arthritis, frozen shoulder, or glenohumeral joint instability), received corticosteroid injection or physiotherapy for shoulder pain in the past 6 months, or were being considered for surgery. Patients were randomly assigned (centralised computer-generated system, 1:1:1:1) to progressive exercise (≤ 6 sessions), best practice advice (one session), corticosteroid injection then progressive exercise, or corticosteroid injection then best practice advice. The primary outcome was the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) score over 12 months, analysed on an intention-to-treat basis (statistical significance set at 1%). The trial was registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Register, ISRCTN16539266, and EuDRACT, 2016-002991-28.

Findings

Between March 10, 2017, and May 2, 2019, we screened 2287 patients. 708 patients were randomly assigned to progressive exercise (n = 174), best practice advice (n = 174), corticosteroid injection then progressive exercise (n = 182), or corticosteroid injection then best practice advice (n = 178). Over 12 months, SPADI data were available for 166 (95%) patients in the progressive exercise group, 164 (94%) in the best practice advice group, 177 (97%) in the corticosteroid injection then progressive exercise group, and 175 (98%) in the corticosteroid injection then best practice advice group. We found no evidence of a difference in SPADI score between progressive exercise and best practice advice when analysed over 12 months (adjusted mean difference -0.66 [99% CI -4.52 to 3.20]). We also found no evidence of a difference between corticosteroid injection compared with no injection when analysed over 12 months (-1.11 [-4.47 to 2.26]). No serious adverse events were reported.

Interpretation

Progressive exercise was not superior to a best practice advice session with a physiotherapist in improving shoulder pain and function. Subacromial corticosteroid injection provided no long-term benefit in patients with rotator cuff disorders.

### Effect of specific exercise strategy on need for surgery in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome: randomised controlled study [^116xqeZ5]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Question

Can a specific exercise strategy improve shoulder function and pain in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome, thereby decreasing the need for arthroscopic subacromial decompression?

Summary Answer

Compared with a control exercise group, patients in the specific exercise group had significantly greater improvements in shoulder function and pain and fewer patients needed surgery at the three month assessment.

What Is Known and What This Paper Adds

Different exercise programmes are used as first line treatment in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome, but conclusive evidence to support the efficacy for these programmes is lacking. This specific exercise strategy proved effective in improving shoulder function and pain in patients in whom earlier conservative treatment had failed.

### Evaluation of an exercise concept focusing on eccentric strength training of the rotator cuff for patients with subacromial impingement syndrome [^111i48wn]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect on pain intensity and function of an exercise concept focusing on specific eccentric strength training of the rotator cuff in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome.

Design

Single-subject research design with baseline and treatment phases (AB design).

Setting

Home-based training programme supervised and supported by visits to physiotherapy clinic.

Subjects

Ten patients, mean (SD) age 54 (8.6) years, symptom duration 12 (9.1) months.

Intervention

Daily eccentric strengthening exercises of the rotator cuff during 12 weeks.

Primary Outcome Measures

Pain intensity, assessed with a visual analogue scale, and function, using the Patient-Specific Functional Scale.

Secondary Outcome Measures

Shoulder function evaluated with the Constant score, and shoulder-related quality of life evaluated with the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index.

Results

Pain intensity decreased significantly in eight of the ten subjects. Function improved significantly in all ten subjects. Constant score increased in nine subjects and Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index increased in seven subjects. Mean Constant score for the whole group increased significantly from 44 to 69 points (P = 0.008). Mean Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index increased from 51 to 71% (P = 0.021).

Conclusion

A 12-week eccentric strengthening programme targeting the rotator cuff and incorporating scapular control and correct movement pattern can be effective in decreasing pain and increasing function in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome. A randomized controlled trial is necessary to provide stronger evidence of the method.
