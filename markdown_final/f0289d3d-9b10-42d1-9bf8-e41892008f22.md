is PVI basically the waveforms on spo2 monitor and looking at variablity sim to a = line waveform variablity

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether PVI basically reflects variability in the pulse oximeter (SpO2) pleth waveform and if that is similar to arterial line waveform variability. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what PVI actually measures and how it is computed. Then, I should clarify the physiological basis for respiratory-induced waveform variation. Next, I will compare pleth-derived indices with arterial line-derived indices like PPV/SVV. After that, I need to check key differences, performance characteristics, and limitations across clinical contexts. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically applicable answer with caveats and thresholds where appropriate [^111aBpGQ] [^111yuDtN].

> Let me first confirm the definition to avoid any confusion: PVI is not just "looking at the waveform"; it is an automated algorithm that continuously quantifies respiratory variations in the pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveform amplitude, essentially automating ΔPOP at the bedside, as originally described with Masimo technology [^111aBpGQ] [^111uqrN7]. Wait, let me verify the linkage with ΔPOP itself; yes, PVI tracks the same respiratory modulation of pleth amplitude that manual ΔPOP calculations target, and validation work showed strong alignment between PVI and ΔPOP under controlled conditions, reinforcing that PVI is a numerical index of the plethysmographic respiratory variability rather than a qualitative visual assessment [^111uqrN7] [^1112tegC].

> I will now examine the physiological basis, because the concept hinges on cardiopulmonary interactions during mechanical ventilation: positive pressure breaths cyclically alter intrathoracic pressure, venous return, and stroke volume, which in turn create respiratory-phase changes in arterial pulse pressure and in peripheral perfusion detected by plethysmography; these variations are useful as dynamic indices of preload dependence and fluid responsiveness when standard assumptions are met [^114zdNH6] [^111yuDtN]. Hold on, I should verify that pleth signals indeed reflect these cyclic changes; studies show ventilatory modulation in pleth amplitude tracks hemodynamic shifts from hypovolemia or pharmacologic changes, supporting the physiologic plausibility of ΔPOP/PVI as preload-responsive signals under controlled ventilation [^114zdNH6] [^111aBpGQ].

> Next, I should review how similar pleth variability is to arterial line waveform variability; conceptually, both ΔPOP/PVI and ΔPP/PPV or SVV index respiratory-induced dynamic change to assess preload dependence, so the underlying principle is aligned [^111yuDtN]. Let me check comparative data to avoid overstatement: head-to-head analyses show that pleth-derived indices can predict fluid responsiveness with discrimination comparable to arterial indices in some settings, including operating room cohorts where AUCs for PVI and SVV/PPV were similar, and earlier clinical work found pleth and arterial variations performed similarly in hypotensive ICU patients, supporting mechanistic similarity and practical overlap under ideal conditions [^1131Rcdm] [^112tFq3m]. But wait, I should double-check broader evidence; meta-analysis of ΔPOP/PVI shows pooled AUC around 0.85, consistent with useful — though not perfect — discrimination, particularly with larger fluid challenges, which frames expectations appropriately [^1112tegC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about interchangeability; I need to check agreement and tracking between pleth and arterial measures. A large intraoperative comparison demonstrated weak correlation and wide limits of agreement between ΔPOP and ΔPP across tens of thousands of respiratory cycles, cautioning against substituting pleth for arterial indices to track trends or classify cycles one-for-one, despite conceptual parallels [^1175vniN]. Let me reconsider clinical granularity; while some studies show similar AUCs at baseline for predicting responsiveness, pleth indices often lag in tracking fluid-induced changes compared with arterial metrics, and site of pleth measurement influences thresholds and performance, underscoring signal provenance and processing differences between peripheral photoplethysmography and invasive arterial pressure waveforms [^114LCHum] [^11786Hsc].

> I should confirm context-specific limitations that could degrade pleth signal performance. In vasopressor-treated patients (e.g., norepinephrine), PVI becomes a weak predictor compared with PPV/SVV, with substantially lower AUC and sensitivity, likely reflecting altered peripheral vasomotor tone and variable pleth signal quality under sympathetic constriction [^1177S6Kn]. After cardiac surgery, PVI often performs poorly relative to PPV, consistent with the combined effects of vasoactive therapy, chest mechanics, and right ventricular interactions; this reinforces that pleth-derived indices are particularly fragile in contexts of abnormal vascular tone or impaired peripheral perfusion [^114UqM57]. Let me double-check the broader synthesis; an updated meta-analysis concluded that PVI's reliability is limited overall but may be more useful in mechanically ventilated ICU patients not undergoing surgery, again highlighting the dependence on context and signal conditions [^116u27hU].

> I need to ensure I anchor the practical thresholds correctly, because clinicians often ask "what cut-off should I use". In anesthetized, mechanically ventilated adults without confounders, reported optimal PVI thresholds have ranged roughly 9.5–16% depending on device, site, and cohort, with single-center studies reporting strong discrimination at thresholds such as 14–16% and others showing equivalence to SVV around 9.5%, whereas measurement site matters, with higher optimal cutoffs at forehead and ear versus finger due to local vascular behavior [^111aBpGQ] [^1131Rcdm] [^11786Hsc]. Wait, I should verify that these cutoffs are not universally portable; yes, across populations and conditions, thresholds vary and gray zones are common, so any single number must be applied with attention to ventilation settings, tidal volume, rhythm, vasoactive use, and sensor site, and clinicians should expect inconclusive ranges where decision-support requires adjunct data or maneuvers [^116u27hU] [^1112tegC].

> But wait, what if a provider only has noninvasive monitoring; can PVI stand in for PPV clinically? Under controlled mechanical ventilation with adequate tidal volume, regular rhythm, and good pleth signal, PVI can serve as a noninvasive dynamic index to flag preload responsiveness, aligning with the arterial line concept, but it should not be considered interchangeable with PPV/SVV for trending or in vasoplegic, low-perfusion, or post-cardiac surgery states, where arterial indices generally retain superior performance and robustness [^1131Rcdm] [^1177S6Kn] [^114UqM57]. I should double-check that overall predictive accuracy remains clinically meaningful; meta-analytic AUCs around 0.82–0.85 for PVI/ΔPOP indicate utility when the physiologic preconditions are met, while acknowledging performance degradation in less controlled settings, which supports a "use with caution and context" recommendation rather than dismissal or uncritical equivalence to invasive indices [^116u27hU] [^1112tegC].

> Synthesis and bottom line: Yes, PVI is an automated, noninvasive quantification of the respiratory variability of the pulse oximeter plethysmographic waveform, and the concept is similar to arterial line waveform variability analysis because both interrogate cardiopulmonary interaction to gauge preload dependence and fluid responsiveness; however, the signals arise from different vascular compartments and measurement technologies, leading to imperfect agreement and context-sensitive performance such that PVI is not identical or universally interchangeable with arterial indices, especially when peripheral tone, vasopressors, low perfusion, spontaneous breathing, arrhythmias, or post-cardiac surgery physiology are present [^111aBpGQ] [^111uqrN7] [^1175vniN] [^1177S6Kn] [^114UqM57] [^116u27hU] [^1112tegC].

No, PVI is not simply visual assessment of SpO2 waveform variability; it is an **automated, quantitative index** [^111uqrN7] of respiratory variation in the plethysmographic waveform, calculated by the monitor and displayed as a percentage [^111aBpGQ] [^116u27hU]. PVI correlates with fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients [^1112tegC], but is **less reliable than invasive arterial waveform indices** (PPV/SVV) [^1177S6Kn] and is affected by perfusion, vasoconstriction, and arrhythmias [^116u27hU]. PVI is a noninvasive, continuous surrogate for PPV/SVV, not a direct substitute [^1175vniN], and should be interpreted with clinical context and awareness of its limitations [^111yuDtN] [^1112tegC].

---

## Physiological basis of PVI

- **Respiratory-induced variation**: Positive-pressure ventilation causes cyclic preload changes, producing respiratory variation in stroke volume and arterial pressure [^111yuDtN]; these are captured by invasive PPV/SVV and noninvasive plethysmographic waveforms [^111uqrN7].

- **Plethysmographic waveform**: The pulse oximeter waveform reflects arterial pulsations and peripheral perfusion [^115wyK9A]; respiratory variation in its amplitude (deltaPOP) tracks preload dependence [^111uqrN7].

- **Automated calculation**: PVI is continuously calculated from the pleth waveform as the ratio of maximum to minimum perfusion index [^111aBpGQ] over several breaths, expressed as a percentage [^111uqrN7].

## Comparison with arterial line waveform variability

| **Parameter** | **PVI (pleth variability index)** | **Arterial line waveform variability (PPV/SVV)** |
|-|-|-|
| Measurement method | Noninvasive, automated from pleth waveform [^111uqrN7] | Invasive, direct arterial pressure waveform [^111yuDtN] |
| Clinical utility | Predicts fluid responsiveness in ventilated patients; noninvasive alternative to PPV/SVV [^1112tegC] [^1134hdMc] | Gold standard for fluid responsiveness; direct hemodynamic measurement [^111yuDtN] |
| Accuracy | Moderate accuracy (AUC ~0.85); affected by perfusion, vasoconstriction, arrhythmias [^1112tegC] [^116u27hU] | High accuracy (AUC ~0.93); less affected by peripheral perfusion [^1177S6Kn] |
| Limitations | Less reliable with vasoconstrictors, low perfusion, arrhythmias, spontaneous breathing [^1177S6Kn] [^116u27hU] [^11786Hsc] | Invasive; requires arterial catheter; risks of infection, bleeding |

## Clinical implications and limitations

- **Clinical utility**: PVI is a practical, noninvasive tool for fluid responsiveness in ventilated patients [^1112tegC], especially when arterial lines are undesirable [^1134hdMc] [^114AqRCX].

- **Limitations**: PVI is less reliable with vasoconstrictors, low perfusion, arrhythmias, or spontaneous breathing; it is a surrogate, not a replacement, for PPV/SVV [^1177S6Kn] [^1175vniN] [^116u27hU].

- **Clinical context**: Use PVI alongside other hemodynamic data and clinical judgment, recognizing its limitations and the patient's condition [^111yuDtN] [^1112tegC].

PVI is an **automated, quantitative index** [^111uqrN7] of respiratory variation in the pleth waveform, not just visual assessment. It offers a noninvasive alternative to PPV/SVV for fluid responsiveness [^111yuDtN] [^1134hdMc], but is less accurate and affected by perfusion and rhythm [^1177S6Kn] [^116u27hU]; interpret it within the clinical context.

### Accuracy of plethysmographic indices as predictors of fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1112tegC]. Intensive Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

To systematically review the accuracy of the variation in pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveform amplitude (∆POP) and the Pleth Variability Index (PVI) as predictors of fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated adults, MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were screened for clinical studies. These studies investigated the accuracy of ∆POP/PVI in predicting the hemodynamic response to a subsequent fluid bolus using a random-effects meta-analysis to summarize results. Data were stratified according to the amount of fluid bolus (large vs. small) and the study index (∆POP vs. PVI).

Ten studies involving 233 patients were included in the meta-analysis, all of whom were in normal sinus rhythm. The pooled area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for identifying fluid responders was 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79–0.92]. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.80 (95% CI 0.74–0.85) and 0.76 (0.68–0.82), respectively. No heterogeneity was found within studies with the same amount of fluid bolus or between studies on ∆POP and those on PVI. The AUC was significantly larger in studies with a large bolus amount than in those with a small bolus [0.92 (95% CI 0.87–0.96) vs. 0.70 (0.62–0.79); p < 0.0001]. Sensitivity and specificity were also higher in studies with a large bolus [0.84 (95% CI 0.77–0.90) vs. 0.72 (0.60–0.82) (small bolus), p = 0.08 and 0.86 (95% CI 0.75–0.93) vs. 0.68 (0.56–0.77) (small bolus), p = 0.02], respectively.

### Pleth variability index to monitor the respiratory variations in the pulse oximeter plethysmographic waveform amplitude and predict fluid responsiveness in the operating theatre [^111aBpGQ]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Respiratory variations in pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveform amplitude (DeltaPOP) can predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients but cannot be easily assessed at the bedside. Pleth variability index (PVI) is a new algorithm allowing for automated and continuous monitoring of DeltaPOP. We hypothesized that PVI can predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients under general anaesthesia.

- **Methods**: Twenty-five patients were studied after induction of general anaesthesia. Haemodynamic data [cardiac index (CI), respiratory variations in arterial pulse pressure (DeltaPP), DeltaPOP, and PVI] were recorded before and after volume expansion (500 mL of hetastarch 6%). Fluid responsiveness was defined as an increase in CI ≥ 15%.

- **Results**: Volume expansion induced changes in CI [2.0 (SD 0.9) to 2.5 (1.2) litre min(-1) m(-2); P < 0.01]. Before volume expansion, PVI, DeltaPOP, and DeltaPP were significantly greater in responders compared to non-responders. A PVI > 14% before volume expansion discriminated between responders and non-responders with 81% sensitivity and 100% specificity. There was a significant relationship between PVI before volume expansion and change in CI after volume expansion (r = 0.67; P < 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: PVI, an automatic and continuous monitor of DeltaPOP, can predict fluid responsiveness non-invasively in mechanically ventilated patients during general anaesthesia. This index has potential clinical applications.

### Pleth variability index is a weak predictor of fluid responsiveness in patients receiving norepinephrine [^1177S6Kn]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

In patients receiving an infusion of norepinephrine, the relationship between the amplitude of the oximeter plethysmographic waveform and stroke volume may be variable, and the quality of the waveform might be reduced compared with patients not receiving norepinephrine. We assessed the reliability of the pleth variability index (PVI), an automatic measurement of the respiratory variation of the plethysmographic waveform, for predicting fluid responsiveness in patients receiving norepinephrine infusions.

- **Methods**: We measured the response of cardiac index (transpulmonary thermodilution) to i.v. fluid administration in 42 critically ill patients receiving norepinephrine. Patients with arrhythmias, spontaneous breathing, tidal volume < 8 mL kg(-1), and respiratory system compliance < 30 mL cm H(2)O(-1) were excluded. Before fluid administration, we recorded the arterial pulse pressure variation (PPV) and pulse contour analysis-derived stroke volume variation (SVV, PiCCO2) and PVI (Masimo Radical-7).

- **Results**: In seven patients, the plethysmographic signal could not be obtained. Among the 35 remaining patients [mean SAPS II score = 77 (sd = 17)], i.v. fluid increased cardiac index ≥ 15% in 15 'responders'. A baseline PVI ≥ 16% predicted fluid responsiveness with a sensitivity of 47% (inter-quartile range = 21–73) and a specificity of 90% (68–99). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was significantly lower for PVI [0.68 (0.09)] than for PPV and SVV [0.93 (0.06) and 0.89 (0.07), respectively]. Considering all pairs of measurements, PVI was correlated with PPV.

### Does the pleth variability index indicate the respiratory-induced variation in the plethysmogram and arterial pressure waveforms [^111uqrN7]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2008). Low credibility.

Respiratory variations in the pulse oximeter plethysmographic waveform amplitude (deltaPOP) are sensitive to changes in preload and can predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients. However, they cannot be easily calculated from a bedside monitor. The pleth variability index (PVI, Masimo Corp, Irvine, CA) is a new algorithm that automatically calculates deltaPOP. The aim of our study was to test the ability of this new device to automatically and continuously monitor deltaPOP.

- **Methods**: Twenty-five patients were studied after the induction of general anesthesia. PVI automatically and continuously calculates the respiratory variations in the plethysmography waveform amplitude (perfusion index). Data, including mean arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, respiratory variations in arterial pulse pressure, deltaPOP, and PVI, were recorded at baseline, in the anti-Trendelenburg position, and finally, in the Trendelenburg position.

- **Results**: There was a significant relationship between PVI and deltaPOP (r = 0.92; P < 0.001). A PVI threshold value of 11.5% was able to discriminate between deltaPOP > 13% and deltaPOP ≤ 13%. At this threshold, the sensitivity and specificity of PVI to detect deltaPOP > 13% was 0.990 ± 0.07.

- **Conclusion**: This study is the first to demonstrate the ability of PVI, an index automatically derived from pulse oximeter waveform analysis, to automatically and continuously monitor deltaPOP. This new index has potential clinical applications for fluid management and monitoring in mechanically ventilated patients.

### Blood pressure measurement and assessment of arterial structure and function: An expert group position paper [^113zbuAm]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

The pressure pulse generated in the proximal aorta due to left ventricular ejection generally increases in amplitude as it propagates towards the periphery due to characteristics of structure and function of the arterial vasculature. In large arteries, mean arterial pressure (MAP) is constant, so change in pulse amplitude is always associated with alterations in wave morphology, such that the area under the central and peripheral pulse wave is similar. In addition, central (cDBP) and peripheral (pDBP) arterial diastolic pressure are also almost similar, so changes in the shape of the pressure pulse wave are predominantly related to differences in central (cSBP) and peripheral (pSBP) systolic pressure. These fundamental physiological observations have been made from invasive measurements and are consistent with physiological considerations of pulse wave propagation.

The differences between cSBP and pSBP have been shown to spread over the range of 0–30 mmHg, with an average difference of 12 mmHg. Because of the distribution of differences, it is not possible to estimate cSBP by subtracting 12 mmHg from measured pSBP, as this would only capture 19% of the values that would be in the similarity range of MAP and DBP. These considerations generated interest in using the peripheral pulse wave to uncover the quantitative relative difference in cSBP and pSBP from noninvasive measurements.

The peripheral pressure pulse can be readily obtained noninvasively from the radial or carotid arteries using applanation tonometry.

### Diastolic function and peripheral venous pressure as indices for fluid responsiveness in cardiac surgical patients [^116WELT1]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2019). Low credibility.

Identifying fluid responsiveness is critical to optimizing perfusion while preventing fluid overload. An experimental study of hypovolemic shock resuscitation showed the importance of ventricular compliance and peripheral venous pressure (PVP) on fluid responsiveness. The authors tested the hypothesis that reduced ventricular compliance, measured using transesophageal echocardiography, results in decreased fluid responsiveness following a fluid bolus.

- **Design**: Prospective observational study.

- **Setting**: Two-center, university hospital study.

- **Participants**: The study comprised 29 patients undergoing elective coronary revascularization.

- **Intervention**: Albumin 5%, 7 mL/kg, was infused over 10 minutes to characterize fluid responders (> 15% increase in stroke volume) from nonresponders.

- **Measurements and main results**: Invasive hemodynamics and the ratio of mitral inflow velocity (E-wave)/annular relaxation (e'), or E/e' ratio, were measured using transesophageal echocardiography to assess left ventricular (LV) compliance at baseline and after albumin infusion. Fifteen patients were classified as responders and 14 as nonresponders. The E/e' ratio in responders was 7.4 ± 1.9 at baseline and 7.1 ± 1.8 after bolus. In contrast, E/e' was significantly higher in nonresponders at baseline (10.7 ± 4.6; p = 0.04) and further increased after bolus (12.6 ± 5.5; p = 0.002). PVP was significantly greater in the nonresponders at baseline (14 ± 4 mmHg vs. 11 ± 3 mmHg; p = 0.02) and increased in both groups after albumin infusion. Fluid responsiveness was tested using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, demonstrating… (Note: Assuming continuation with the data provided).

### Pleth variability index to predict fluid responsiveness in colorectal surgery [^111ieG31]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2011). Low credibility.

Goal-directed fluid therapy during major abdominal surgery may reduce postoperative morbidity. The Pleth Variability Index (PVI), derived from the pulse oximeter waveform, has been shown to predict fluid responsiveness in various surgical scenarios. In this study, we sought to determine whether PVI could predict fluid responsiveness in low-risk colorectal surgery patients who had fluid therapy guided by esophageal Doppler stroke volume measurements.

- **Methods**: Twenty-five low-risk patients undergoing colorectal resection under general anesthesia were studied. Baseline values for esophageal Doppler stroke volume and PVI, taken from finger and ear probes, were compared with final values after (a) a 500-mL fluid bolus immediately after induction (steady-state) and tracheal intubation before the start of the surgery, and (b) 250-mL boluses given in response to a decrease in stroke volume of 10% during surgery as measured by esophageal Doppler (dynamic). Patients were classified into responders and nonresponders based on a stroke volume increase of more than 10%.

- **Results**: Baseline PVI at the finger was significantly higher in responders under both steady-state and intraoperative conditions. In the steady state, PVI at both the finger and earlobe showed significant predictive ability for an increase in stroke volume: the area under the curve for the finger was 0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.88–1.00; P = 0.011) and for the earlobe was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.93–1.00; P = 0.008). In dynamic intraoperative conditions, PVI at the finger predicted increases in stroke volume.

### Extracting arterial flow waveforms from pulse oximeter waveforms apparatus [^113wDHQY]. Anaesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

A method is described which allows an approximation to the arterial flow waveform to be derived from a pulse oximeter waveform. The observed pulse oximeter waveform is the sum of arterial inflow and venous outflow. These components are separated mathematically; subtraction of the venous outflow reveals the underlying arterial flow waveform. The assumptions on which the method is based are stated explicitly and discussed.

### Central-to-peripheral stiffness gradients determine diastolic pressure and flow fluctuation waveforms: Time domain analysis of femoral artery pulse [^1121B7XM]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). High credibility.

Blood pressure fluctuates during diastole to create a dicrotic wave, but the mechanistic origin remains poorly understood. We sought to investigate the characteristics and determinants of diastolic pressure and flow fluctuations, focusing on stiffness gradients between the central aorta and peripheral arteries.

- **Methods**: Using applanation tonometry and duplex ultrasound, pulse waveforms were recorded on the femoral artery in 592 patients (age: 55 ± 14 years) to estimate diastolic pressure fluctuation as a residual wave against the mono-exponential decay. Diastolic flow fluctuation was estimated as a bidirectional (forward and reverse) velocity wave. Radial, carotid, and dorsalis pedis pressures were recorded to measure peripheral/aortic pulse pressure (PP) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) ratios.

- **Results**: There were close resemblances between femoral pressure and flow fluctuation waveforms. The pressure and flow fluctuations were mutually correlated in relative amplitude, indexed to total pulse height (r = 0.63), with pressure fluctuations following flow fluctuations temporally. In multivariate-adjusted models, higher peripheral/aortic PP and PWV ratios were independently associated with greater pressure and flow fluctuation indices (P < 0.001). Mediation analysis revealed that the associations of PP and PWV ratios with the pressure fluctuation index were largely mediated by the flow fluctuation index [indirect/total effect ratio: 57% (95% CI 42–80) and 54% (30–100), respectively].

- **Conclusion**: These results suggest that central-to-peripheral pulse amplification and stiffness gradients significantly influence diastolic pressure and flow fluctuations.

### Evaluating the relationship between arterial blood pressure changes and indices of pulse oximetric plethysmography [^114zdNH6]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2002). Low credibility.

The finger plethysmographic waveform of pulse oximeters is a qualitative indicator of fingertip perfusion. This waveform has been used to assess the depth of anesthesia. Cyclical changes associated with mechanical ventilation have been utilized to detect blood volume changes under normotensive conditions. It has been revealed that minimal normotensive hypovolemia can cause a significant increase in the delta-down component of this waveform.

Hypovolemia may be associated with hypotension; however, hypotension can result from causes other than hypovolemia. Since the effects of hypotension on the plethysmographic waveform have not been fully evaluated, detecting hypovolemia by inspecting a plethysmogram in these conditions can be challenging. Therefore, this study was performed to evaluate the effect of normovolemic hypotension on the characteristics of the plethysmographic waveform in 33 adult patients undergoing general anesthesia with controlled hypotension. The delta-down and ventilatory systolic variation components increased significantly with decreases in systolic blood pressure.

The study results show that the effect of pharmacologic hypotension on the plethysmographic waveform of the pulse oximeter is similar to that of minimal hypovolemia. Consequently, blood volume may be inaccurately assessed by inspecting ventilatory-induced cyclical changes in the pulse oximetric waveform in the presence of hypotension.

The cyclical respiratory-induced changes in the amplitude of the pulse oximeter waveform can be used to detect normotensive hypovolemia.

### Pleth variability index or stroke volume optimization during open abdominal surgery: A randomized controlled trial [^112BDMrt]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). High credibility.

Other non-invasive methods for dynamic monitoring are available. One meta-analysis reported that the offline assessment of respiratory variation in pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveform amplitude (∆POP) for predicting fluid responsiveness is comparable to that of PVI (AUC 0.89 vs. 0.95), but this technique is not yet available in real time. Additionally, pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation can now be obtained non-invasively using the Nexfin/Clearsight™ or the CNAP™ systems, but their capacity for predicting fluid responsiveness differs between studies. The same applies to measurements of the variability of the diameter of the caval vein or other veins during positive pressure ventilation. Contrary to PVI, the effect on clinical outcome of all these techniques has, to the best of our knowledge, not been studied.

PVI is a dynamic indicator of fluid responsiveness based on cardiopulmonary interaction, while stroke volume optimization is not. As both methods are claimed to benefit fluid management, we argue that these methods, though differing in concept, can be compared in a randomized trial focusing on clinical outcome. Maintaining a patient below a certain PVI value might appear to be less aggressive than aiming for the plateau of the Starling curve, but this depends on the selected cut-off values. Probably, a higher cut-off value for PVI with the same settings (such as tidal volume) would have resulted in less fluid administration and vice versa. We have previously shown that a PVI value of 10.5% was optimal in this material.

### Accuracy of stroke volume variation compared with pleth variability index to predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients undergoing major surgery [^1131Rcdm]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Accurate assessment of a patient's volume status is an important goal for an anaesthetist, yet most variables assessing fluid responsiveness are either invasive or technically challenging. This study was designed to compare the accuracy of arterial pressure-based stroke volume variation (SVV) and variations in the pulse oximeter plethysmographic waveform amplitude, as evaluated with the noninvasive calculated pleth variability index (PVI), with central venous pressure to predict the response of stroke volume index (SVI) to volume replacement in patients undergoing major surgery.

- **Methods**: We studied 20 patients scheduled for elective major abdominal surgery. After induction of anaesthesia, all haemodynamic variables were recorded immediately before (T1) and subsequent to volume replacement (T2) by infusion of 6% hydroxy-ethyl starch (HES) 130/0.4 (7 ml/kg) at a rate of 1 ml/kg/min.

- **Results**: The volume-induced increase in SVI was at least 15% in 15 patients (responders) and less than 15% in five patients (nonresponders). Baseline SVV correlated significantly with changes in SVI (DeltaSVI; r = 0.80; P < 0.001) as did baseline PVI (r = 0.61; P < 0.004), whereas baseline values of central venous pressure showed no correlation to DeltaSVI. There was no significant difference between the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for SVV (0.993) and PVI (0.973). The best threshold values to predict fluid responsiveness were more than 11% for SVV and more than 9.5% for PVI.

- **Conclusion**: Although arterial pressure-derived SVV revealed the b

### The use of oxygen reserve index in one-lung ventilation and its impact on peripheral oxygen saturation, perfusion index and, pleth variability index [^111DFyGJ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Low credibility.

The Oxygen Reserve Index (ORi) is a multiwavelength pulse oximeter and provides continuous analysis of PaO2 values of moderate hyperoxia at a range of 100–200 mmHg. This device can measure several oximeter-related parameters: ORi, SpO2, perfusion index (PI), and perfusion pleth variability index (PVI). The multiwave pulse co-oximetry device can provide a calculated ORi for pulse oximetry values greater than 98%. For instance, when a falling PaO2 value approaches 100 mmHg and a SpO2 value is higher than 98%, the multiwave oximeter device measures an ORi value that decreases, approaching a value of 0.24. This observation from a previous study suggests that ORi may provide information in clinical situations of impending hypoxic or unintended hyperoxic states. The ORi parameter offers a value that ranges between "1", indicating a significant oxygen reserve, and "0", indicating no oxygen reserve. ORi begins to increase from 0.00 at a PaO2 value of 100 mmHg and reaches a plateau of 1.00 at a PaO2 value of 200 mmHg.

- **Perfusion index (PI)**: PI is an indicator of the relative strength of the pulsatile signal from a pulse oximetry device. A higher PI value indicates increased pulsatile movement and improved peripheral circulation at the sensor site.

- **Pleth variability index (PVI)**: PVI is the relative variability in the pleth waveform and provides a value between 0.

### Respiratory waveform variation can prevent pulsus paradoxus measurement by sphygmomanometry [^116jJhwt]. The Journal of Asthma (2019). Low credibility.

Pulsus paradoxus (PP) represents increased fluctuation of systolic pressure during the respiratory cycle. PP increases in pathologic conditions, including asthma and other obstructive airway diseases. Respiratory waveform variation (RWV) represents arterial-waveform baseline variability resulting from intra-pleural pressure changes during the respiratory cycle in the presence of airway obstruction. It is not known whether RWV influences manual PP measurement using a sphygmomanometer and stethoscope.

- **Methods**: We performed an observational study in six healthy adults. Participants performed tidal breathing through a breathing apparatus with predetermined inspiratory (0–45.6 cm H2O) and expiratory (0–24.4 cm H2O) resistance levels for a total of 23 data sets per participant. PP was measured from continuous radial artery pressure recordings as the absolute difference between maximum and minimum systolic pressure levels during a complete respiratory cycle.

- **Results**: In this study, PP values measured without applied airway resistance exceeded 10 mmHg, the traditional definition of PP, in five of the six participants. Manual measurement of PP would not be possible at greater RWV because the maximum diastolic pressure exceeded minimum systolic pressure during RWV.

- **Conclusions**: PP in normal adults may exceed 10 mmHg, and RWV may be of sufficient magnitude to preclude manual PP measurement.

### Comparison between respiratory variations in pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveform amplitude and arterial pulse pressure during major abdominal surgery [^1175vniN]. Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

To assess preload dependence, the variation of the plethysmographic waveform of pulse oximetry (ΔPOP) has been proposed as a surrogate for pulse pressure variation (ΔPP). The study aimed to assess the ability of the pulse oximeter-derived plethysmographic analysis to accurately trend ΔPP in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery using standard monitors.

A continuous recording of arterial and plethysmographic waveform was performed in 43 patients undergoing abdominal surgery. ΔPP and ΔPOP were calculated on validated respiratory cycles. For analysis, 92,467 respiratory cycles were retained (73.5% of cycles recorded in 40 patients). The mean of intrapatient coefficients of correlation was low (r = 0.22). The Bland and Altman analysis showed a systematic bias of 5.21, with ΔPOP being greater than ΔPP. This bias increased with the mean value of the two indices, and the limits of agreement were wide (upper 21.7% and lower -11.3%).

Considering a ΔPP threshold at 12% to classify respiratory cycles as responders and nonresponders, the corresponding best cutoff value of ΔPOP was 13.6 ± 4.3%. Using these threshold values, the observed classification agreement was moderate (κ = 0.50 ± 0.09). The wide limits of agreement between ΔPP and ΔPOP, and the weak correlation between both values, cast doubt on the ability of ΔPOP to substitute ΔPP to follow trends in preload dependence. This affects the classification of respiratory cycles as responders or nonresponders using standard monitors during anesthesia for major abdominal surgery.

### Value and variability of pulse shape indicator for estimating mean arterial pressure in the radial and femoral arteries [^113hsW9E]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

The main findings of this prospective study conducted in hemodynamically stable patients who were critically ill are as follows:

- **Mean FF value**: The mean FF value was 0.35 at the radial artery level and 0.34 at the femoral artery level.

- **Gender differences**: FF was slightly higher in women than in men at both arterial sites, with no effect of age.

- **Variability and accuracy**: Despite inter-individual and intra-individual FF variability, the use of a fixed FF value of 0.33 allowed for accurate and precise estimation of the time-averaged MAP at both arterial sites, both at baseline and following dynamic maneuvers.

The FF is a pulse shape indicator primarily influenced by arterial location. It may also be influenced by demographic, hemodynamic, pathological, and methodological factors. FF varies depending on the arterial location due to significant changes in arterial waveform morphologies as the pressure travels from the aorta to peripheral arteries. Invasive studies have shown that the mean FF range is 0.41 to 0.45 in the central aorta, 0.37 to 0.40 at the brachial artery level, and 0.31 to 0.36 at the radial artery level. Therefore, FF decreases from the aorta to the brachial artery and further decreases from the brachial to the radial artery. It is important to note that MAP and DBP remain essentially constant from the aorta to the radial artery. Consequently, this decrease in FF reflects the central-to-peripheral SBP amplification phenomenon and the progressive peaking of the pressure waveform.

### Aortic stiffness and blood pressure variability in young people: a multimodality investigation of central and peripheral vasculature [^113SEGZx]. Journal of Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Increased blood pressure (BP) variability is a cardiovascular risk marker for young individuals and may relate to the ability of their aorta to buffer cardiac output. We used a multimodality approach to determine relations between central and peripheral arterial stiffness and BP variability.

- **Methods**: We studied 152 adults (mean age of 31 years) who had BP variability measures based on the standard deviation of awake ambulatory BPs, 24-hour weighted standard deviation, and average real variability (ARV). Global and regional aortic distensibility was measured by cardiovascular magnetic resonance, arterial stiffness by cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), and pulse wave velocity (PWV) by SphygmoCor (carotid-femoral) and Vicorder (brachial-femoral).

- **Results**: In young people, free from overt cardiovascular disease, all indices of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) variability correlated with aortic distensibility (global aortic distensibility versus awake SBP SD: r = -0.39, P < 0.001; SBP ARV: r = -0.34, P < 0.001; weighted 24-hour SBP SD: r = -0.42, P < 0.001). CAVI, which closely associated with aortic distensibility, also related to DBP variability, as well as awake SBP SD (r = 0.19, P < 0.05) and weighted 24-hour SBP SD (r = 0.24, P < 0.01), with a trend for SBP ARV (r = 0.17, P = 0.06). In contrast, associations with PWV were only between carotid-femoral PWV and weighted SD of SBP (r = 0.20, P = 0.03), as well as weighted and ARV of DBP.

- **Conclusion**: Greater BP variability in young people relates to increases in central aortic stiffness. Strategies to measure and protect aortic function from a young age may be important to reduce cardiovascular risk.

### Prediction of responsiveness to an intravenous fluid challenge in patients after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass: a comparison between arterial pulse pressure variation and digital plethysmographic variability index [^114UqM57]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Arterial pulse pressure variation (PPV) and digital plethysmographic variability index (PVI) have been proposed to predict fluid responsiveness during anesthesia and in critically ill patients. The present study aimed to compare the clinical utility of PPV and PVI in predicting fluid responsiveness after elective cardiac surgery.

- **Design**: A prospective observational study conducted at a university hospital.

- **Participants**: Eighty-seven adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit after cardiac surgery were investigated before and following a fluid challenge.

- **Measurements and main results**: The study compared the discrimination of both PPV and PVI in predicting fluid responsiveness using areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves (ROCAUC). Sensibility analyses were conducted after excluding patients with a low perfusion index, those receiving norepinephrine, and those with right ventricular dysfunction. Among the patients, fifty-seven (71%) were responders and twenty-three (29%) were nonresponders. The ROCAUC were 0.73 [95% CI: 0.63–0.83] for PPV and 0.60 [95% CI: 0.48–0.71] for PVI in the whole cohort (p = 0.020). In the inconclusive class of responses, 47 (59%) and 62 (77%) patients were included for PPV and PVI, respectively (p = 0.010). Although PVI's discrimination remained low across patient subgroups, PPV's discrimination markedly increased in patients without a perfusion index ≤ 1.3 (ROCAUC = 0.83 [95% CI: 0.68–0.93]) and in patients without right ventricular dysfunction (ROCAUC = 0.85 [95% CI: 0.67–0.95]).

### Blood pressure variability in clinical practice: Past, present and the future [^116iNvMU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

The main determinant of arterial blood pressure (BP) is the stretch on the walls of the artery by the volume of blood it contains. This pressure increases during systole (due to an increased inflow of blood into the arterial system) and decreases after the peak of ejection (diastole). These dynamic and cyclical changes in the blood volume entering the aorta are reflected as cyclic changes in the aortic BP waveform. The elastic aortic compliance buffers changes in stroke volume, while autonomic and hormonal influences govern the tone of the muscular peripheral artery, which regulates arterial BP essential for maintaining adequate perfusion to meet the metabolic demands.

The relationship between arterial wall compliance and arterial volume is curvilinear (aortic volume–pressure relationship). Due to this curvilinear relationship, the change in arterial pressure associated with the change in volume is greater at a higher initial volume; that is, a higher pulse pressure will be produced even with a similar stroke volume if the initial arterial volume is higher. The initial higher volume elicits a greater arterial tone and therefore lowers the buffering capacity. Conditions affecting aortic compliance, such as premature or advanced aortic stiffening or reduced aortic compliance (related to aging, chronic hypertension, arteriosclerosis, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or heart failure) may blunt the aortic capacity to regulate and maintain an optimal BP and increase BP variability toward unhealthy levels.

### Measurement and interpretation of central venous pressure: a narrative review [^112oqctg]. Anaesthesia (2025). Low credibility.

Central venous pressure remains a fundamental yet controversial parameter in haemodynamic monitoring. While evidence suggests that the absolute CVP value alone is a poor predictor of fluid responsiveness, integrating CVP with waveform analysis and trend monitoring provides valuable insights into right heart function, venous congestion, and organ perfusion. Emerging evidence suggests there is valuable interplay between CVP and critical physiological variables, such as right ventricular diastolic dysfunction, microcirculatory perfusion, and Doppler-derived venous waveforms, reinforcing the relevance of CVP monitoring in peri-operative and critical care settings.

As surgical and critically ill patient populations become increasingly complex, the role of CVP should be reconsidered — not as an isolated predictor, but as a component of comprehensive haemodynamic assessment. Understanding the nuances of CVP trends, waveform morphology, and its interactions with other haemodynamic markers remains integral to informing accurate clinical decision-making in critical care medicine. Future research directions may include refining the integration of CVP with advanced monitoring modalities while minimizing reliance on outdated paradigms of volume assessment to optimize patient outcomes.

### Comparison of arterial pressure and plethysmographic waveform-based dynamic preload variables in assessing fluid responsiveness and dynamic arterial tone in patients undergoing major hepatic resection [^114LCHum]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Dynamic preload variables to predict fluid responsiveness are based either on the arterial pressure waveform (APW) or on the plethysmographic waveform (PW). We compared the ability of APW-based variations in stroke volume (SVV) and pulse pressure (PPV) and of PW-based plethysmographic variability index (PVI) to predict fluid responsiveness and to track fluid changes in patients undergoing major hepatic resection. Furthermore, we assessed whether the PPV/SVV ratio, as a measure of dynamic arterial elastance (Eadyn), could predict a reduction in norepinephrine requirement after fluid administration.

- **Methods**: Thirty patients received intravenous fluid (15 mL kg⁻¹ in 30 min) after hepatic resection and were considered responders when stroke volume index (SVI) increased ≥ 20% after fluid administration. SVV and SVI were measured by the FloTrac-Vigileo® device, and PVI was measured by the Masimo Radical 7 pulse co-oximeter®.

- **Results**: The areas under a receiver operating characteristic curve for SVV, PPV, and PVI were 0.81, 0.77, and 0.78, respectively. In responders, all dynamic variables, except PVI, decreased after fluid administration. Eadyn predicted a reduced norepinephrine requirement (AUC = 0.81).

- **Conclusions**: In patients undergoing major hepatic resection, both APW- and PW-based dynamic preload variables predict fluid responsiveness (preload) to a similar extent. Most variables (except PVI) also tracked fluid changes. Eadyn, as a measure of arterial elastance (afterload), might be helpful to distinguish the origin of hypotension.

### The predictive value of the pleth variability index on fluid responsiveness in spontaneously breathing anaesthetized children — a prospective observational study [^117HA62b]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2020). Low credibility.

- **Passive leg raising (PLR) test and fluid responsiveness**: A PLR test can best be described as a reversible pseudo-volume challenge, as venous blood from the lower extremities is translocated to the upper body. Lukito et al. applied a PLR test in pediatric ICU patients using a setting comparable to ours, defining fluid responsiveness as an increase in cardiac output of ≥ 10% following a fluid challenge of 10 mL/kg of NaCl 0.9%, administered over 15 minutes. In adult subjects, combining a PLR test and the PVI has been shown to improve the validity of the obtained information regarding the prediction of fluid responsiveness under spontaneous breathing conditions.

We applied two PLR tests and found significant effects of PLR on PVI, stroke volume (SV), and cardiac index (CI) both before and after fluid administration in the fluid responsive positive (FRpos) patient group, and no effect in the fluid responsive negative (FRneg) group (see Table 3).

The following new question arises: If a drop in PVI values during a PLR test is reliably associated with a rise in SV/CI, do we still need the advanced technology of cardiac output monitors to predict fluid responsiveness? This question is of significant practical importance, as many hospitals have the PVI incorporated in their standard monitoring while very few have non-invasive cardiac output monitors available. PVI changes during a PLR test may be an alternative approach to define a PVI cut-off value indicating fluid responsiveness — not necessarily as an absolute number but probably as a percentage of change compared to baseline. Large-scale trials would be necessary to answer this question.

### Peripheral venous pressure as a measure of venous compliance during pheochromocytoma resection [^116mnuNe]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

Venous pressures measured from peripheral venous catheters (PVP) closely estimate the central venous pressure (CVP) in surgical and critically ill patients. CVP is often used to estimate intravascular volume; however, fluctuations of CVP may also be induced by changes in venous tone caused by alpha-adrenergic catecholamine stimulation. We simultaneously monitored PVP, CVP, and mean arterial blood pressure during resection of pheochromocytoma in a 63-year-old woman and found excellent correlation between the three pressure variables, suggesting that fluctuations of PVP reflect overall changes in vascular tone.

### The predictive value of the pleth variability index on fluid responsiveness in spontaneously breathing anaesthetized children-a prospective observational study [^1168hYtP]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2020). Low credibility.

Between December 2019 and February 2020, 50 patients were enrolled in this study. Data from ten patients had to be secondarily excluded from analysis; in seven children, the fluid bolus was administered too slowly; two patients received pressure support ventilation; and in one patient, equipment failure resulted in loss of PVI data. Characteristics of the remaining 40 patients available for data analysis are presented in Table 1.

Note: In 17 children, fluid administration resulted in a ≥ 10% increase in stroke volume (SV), and these patients were classified as fluid responsive (FR pos). Twenty-three patients showed an increase of less than 10% in SV after fluid administration, and they were classified as not fluid responsive (FR neg).

A receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis, investigating the performance of the PVI as a predictor of fluid responsiveness, revealed an area under the ROC curve of 0.781 (95% CI: 0.623 to 0.896, P = 0.0002).

In group FR pos, PVI values were higher at baseline than after fluid administration (21.4 ± 5.9 vs 15.0 ± 9.4%, 95% CI of difference 1.1% to 11.8%, P = 0.02). In group FR neg, there was no evidence of a difference between PVI values at baseline and after fluid administration.

### The predictive value of the pleth variability index on fluid responsiveness in spontaneously breathing anaesthetized children-a prospective observational study [^113LJZN6]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2020). Low credibility.

- **Pediatric PVI studies**: Several pediatric studies investigating the PVI as a predictor of fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated anesthetized children have been published during the last decade. In these studies, fluid challenges were performed with both colloids and crystalloids, with volumes ranging from 10 to 20 mL/kg, and there was no consistency in the definition of fluid responsiveness. As a consequence of the significant diversity in study design, the reported PVI thresholds for fluid responsiveness ranged from > 11% to > 18%. It is obvious that, due to the diversity in interventions and outcome variables, the pediatric studies investigating the predictive value of the PVI regarding fluid responsiveness published thus far are almost incomparable to each other and our study. Consensus among future researchers in this field, particularly regarding outcome parameters, would certainly be useful.

- **Pleth variability index in spontaneously breathing patients**: There is an ongoing debate regarding the applicability of the PVI in spontaneously breathing patients. Based on cardiorespiratory physiology, purists recommend the use of PVI only in mechanically ventilated patients. However, our data provide initial evidence that the PVI might be of some value in spontaneously breathing anesthetized young children. In our study, data collection took place after the induction of general anesthesia. Both sevoflurane and propofol have dose-dependent vasodilatory and negative inotropic properties, particularly in neonates and infants. Minor negative effects of anesthesia were observed.

### The use of oxygen reserve index in one-lung ventilation and its impact on peripheral oxygen saturation, perfusion index and, pleth variability index [^113Dm6gT]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Low credibility.

Later, we evaluated the representative trends of the ORi and PI values and the ORi and PVI values at different time points during anesthesia induction and maintenance of thoracic surgeries, as represented in Figures 2 and 3.

- **Figure 2**: The oxygen reserve index (ORi) and perfusion index (PI) values at different time points of surgery.
- **Figure 3**: The oxygen reserve index (ORi) and pleth variability index (PVI) values at different time points of surgery.

For hemodynamical and oximeter parameters, including HR, MAP, SBP, DBP, and SpO₂ values, a correlation between these parameters was not found in the statistical analysis (p > 0.05). In our study, we demonstrated a time-dependent correlation between PVI and MAP at the time point of OLV90, indicating that PVI showed a relation to MAP at a late stage of the thoracic surgical procedure.

In our study, we investigated the ORi and PVI values at different time points during anesthesia induction and maintenance of thoracic surgery. Our findings show that fluid deficit or fluid overload causes changes in PI and PVI values. This is observed in our representative trend graphs in Figures 2 and 3. Our study provides valuable data for the investigation of correlations between ORi, PI, and PVI. At the time point of DS5, there is a significant negative correlation with PI (r = −0.332, p = 0.019); however, no correlations with PVI were noted.

Table 3 presents the median values and interquartile range of PI and PVI values at different measurement points during the study.

### The use of oxygen reserve index in one-lung ventilation and its impact on peripheral oxygen saturation, perfusion index, and pleth variability index [^113zViwS]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Low credibility.

Our goal is to investigate the use of the oxygen reserve index (ORi) to detect hypoxemia and its relation with parameters such as peripheral oxygen saturation, perfusion index (PI), and pleth variability index (PVI) during one-lung ventilation (OLV).

- **Methods**: Fifty patients undergoing general anesthesia and OLV for elective thoracic surgeries were enrolled in an observational cohort study in a tertiary care teaching hospital. All patients required OLV following a left-sided double-lumen tube insertion during intubation. The definition of hypoxemia during OLV is a peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) value of less than 95%, while the inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) is higher than 50% on a pulse oximetry device. ORi, pulse oximetry, PI, and PVI values were measured continuously. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios, and accuracy were calculated for ORi values equal to zero at different time points during surgery to predict hypoxemia. At Clinicaltrials.gov registry, the Registration ID is NCT05050552.

- **Results**: Hypoxemia was observed in 19 patients (38%). The accuracy for predicting hypoxemia during anesthesia induction at ORi value equals zero at 5 min after intubation in the supine position (DS5) showed a sensitivity of 92.3% (95% CI 84.9–99.6), specificity of 81.1% (95% CI 70.2–91.9), and an accuracy of 84.0% (95% CI 73.8–94.2). For predicting hypoxemia, ORi equals zero showed good sensitivity, specificity, and statistical accuracy values for time points from DS5 until OLV30.

### The predictive value of the Pleth Variability Index on fluid responsiveness in spontaneously breathing anaesthetized children-a prospective observational study [^116oMJ39]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2020). Low credibility.

- **Effects of fluid challenge on PVI, PI, and hemodynamic parameters**: Individual values, bars represent mean values, and whiskers represent SD. FRneg indicates non fluid responsive patients, while FRpos indicates fluid responsive patients. HR, MAP, PI, PVI, and SV stand for heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, perfusion index, Pleth Variability Index, and stroke volume, respectively.

In study group FRpos, the PVI during the PLR tests before and after fluid administration was lower than baseline, while SV and cardiac index (CI) increased. In study group FRneg, no evidence of change in hemodynamic parameters was found during the two PLR tests. More detailed information is available in Table 3.

- **Table 3: Passive leg raising (PLR) tests and hemodynamic variables**

End-tidal sevoflurane concentrations were comparable between study groups at baseline (FRpos 2.7 ± 1.1% vs. FRneg 2.8 ± 0.9%, 95% CI of difference −0.66 to 0.59%, P = 0.905) and after fluid administration (FRpos 2.5 ± 0.4% vs. FRneg 2.5 ± 0.4%, 95% CI of difference −0.22% to 0.3%, P = 0.735).

### Prediction of arterial pressure increase after fluid challenge [^113VTr4c]. BMC Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg is recommended for critically ill hypotensive patients, whereas they do not benefit from supranormal cardiac output values. In this study, we investigated if the increase in mean arterial pressure after volume expansion could be predicted by cardiovascular and renal variables. This is a relevant topic because unnecessary positive fluid balance increases mortality, organ dysfunction, and Intensive Care Unit length of stay.

- **Methods**: Thirty-six hypotensive patients (mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg) received a fluid challenge with hydroxyethyl starch. Patients were excluded if they had active bleeding and/or required changes in vasoactive agents' infusion rate in the previous 30 minutes. Responders were defined by the increase of mean arterial pressure value to over 65 mmHg or by more than 20% with respect to the value recorded before fluid challenge. Measurements were performed before and at one hour after the end of the fluid challenge.

- **Results**: Twenty-two patients (61%) increased arterial pressure after volume expansion. Baseline heart rate, arterial pressure, central venous pressure, central venous saturation, central venous to arterial PCO2 difference, lactate, urinary output, fractional excretion of sodium, and urinary sodium/potassium ratio were similar between responders and non-responders. Only 7 out of 36 patients had valuable dynamic indices, and they were excluded from the analysis. When the variables were tested as predictors of responders, they showed values of areas under the ROC curve ranging between 0.502 and 0.604.

### The predictive value of the pleth variability index on fluid responsiveness in spontaneously breathing anaesthetized children — a prospective observational study [^115dmzAu]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2020). Low credibility.

In this study performed in spontaneously breathing anesthetized children, baseline Pleth Variability Index (PVI) values in fluid responsive patients (FR positive) were higher than in those not responding to a crystalloid fluid challenge (FR negative). In FR positive patients, PVI values significantly declined after fluid administration, while this was not observed in FR negative patients. Our findings allow us to tentatively conclude that the PVI might be of some value as a predictor of fluid responsiveness in anesthetized spontaneously breathing young children.

Receiver operating curve analysis revealed an area under the ROC curve of 0.781 (95% CI: 0.623 to 0.896, P = 0.0002). Youden's J Index (Sensitivity + Specificity −1) was 0.519 and the associated PVI value to predict fluid responsiveness was > 15%, with a sensitivity of 82%, specificity of 70%, and a positive predictive value of 2.71 (95% CI: 1.4 to 5.2). Lower threshold values result in a decrease in specificity and an increase in sensitivity, whereas higher threshold values cause opposite changes. Though we would like to have both sensitivity and specificity close to 100%, PVI thresholds with either a high specificity or a high sensitivity may be of some clinical value, depending on patient characteristics and pathology. In a child prone to cardiac failure due to volume overload (e.g. with a hemodynamically relevant ventricular septum defect), it might be wise to choose a threshold with a high specificity, whereas in a volume-dependent child (e.g. a Fontan circulation), the decision to give a fluid bolus should preferably be made using this index.

### Influence of the site of measurement on the ability of plethysmographic variability index to predict fluid responsiveness [^11786Hsc]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Plethysmographic variability index (PVI) is an accurate predictor of fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients. However, the site of measurement of the plethysmographic waveform impacts its morphology and its respiratory variation. The goal of this study was to investigate the ability of PVI to predict fluid responsiveness at three sites of measurement (the forehead, ear, and finger) in mechanically ventilated patients under general anaesthesia.

- **Methods**: We studied 28 subjects after induction of general anaesthesia. Subjects were monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter and three pulse oximeter sensors (the finger, ear, and forehead). Pulse pressure variation, central venous pressure, cardiac index (CI), and PVI measured at the forehead, ear, and finger (PVI(forehead), PVI(ear), and PVI(finger)) were recorded before and after fluid loading (FL). Subjects were responders to volume expansion if CI increased > 15% after FL.

- **Results**: Areas under the receiver-operating curves to predict fluid responsiveness were 0.906, 0.880, and 0.836 for PVI(forehead), PVI(ear), and PVI(finger), respectively (P < 0.05). PVI(forehead), PVI(ear), and PVI(finger) had a threshold value to predict fluid responsiveness of 15%, 16%, and 12% with sensitivities of 89%, 74%, and 74% and specificities of 78%, 74%, and 67%, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: PVI can predict fluid responsiveness in anaesthetized and ventilated subjects at all three sites of measurement. However, the threshold values for predicting fluid responsiveness differ with the site of measurement.

### Reliability of pleth variability index in predicting preload responsiveness of mechanically ventilated patients under various conditions: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116u27hU]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Low credibility.

Goal-directed volume expansion is increasingly used for fluid management in mechanically ventilated patients. The Pleth Variability Index (PVI) has been shown to reliably predict preload responsiveness; however, much research on PVI has been published recently, necessitating an update of the meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: We searched PUBMED, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science (updated to November 7, 2018), along with associated references. Relevant authors and researchers were contacted for complete data.

- **Results**: Twenty-five studies with 975 mechanically ventilated patients were included in this meta-analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) to predict preload responsiveness was 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79–0.85). The pooled sensitivity was 0.77 (95% CI 0.67–0.85), and the pooled specificity was 0.77 (95% CI 0.71–0.82). The results of the subgroup of patients not undergoing surgery (AUC = 0.86, Youden index = 0.65) and the subgroup of patients in the ICU (AUC = 0.89, Youden index = 0.67) were reliable.

- **Conclusion**: The reliability of the PVI is limited, but the PVI can play an important role in bedside monitoring for mechanically ventilated patients who are not undergoing surgery. Patients who are expanded with colloid may be more suitable for PVI.

### Noninvasive assessment of the digital volume pulse. Comparison with the peripheral pressure pulse [^115wyK9A]. Hypertension (2000). Low credibility.

The digital volume pulse can be recorded simply and noninvasively by photoplethysmography. The objective of the present study was to determine whether a generalized transfer function can be used to relate the digital volume pulse to the peripheral pressure pulse and, hence, to determine whether both volume and pressure pulse waveforms are influenced by the same mechanism.

The digital volume pulse was recorded by photoplethysmography in 60 subjects (10 women, aged 24 to 80 years), including 20 subjects with previously diagnosed hypertension. Simultaneous recordings of the peripheral radial pulse and digital artery pulse were obtained by applanation tonometry and a servocontrolled pressure cuff (Finapres), respectively. In 20 normotensive subjects, measurements were obtained after the administration of nitroglycerin (NTG, 500 microgram sublingually).

Transfer functions obtained by Fourier analysis of the waveforms were similar in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. In normotensive subjects, transfer functions were similar before and after NTG. Using a single generalized transfer function for all subjects, the radial and digital artery pressure waveforms could be predicted from the volume pulse with an average root mean square error of 4.4 ± 2.0 and 4.3 ± 1.9 mm Hg (mean ± SD) for radial and digital artery waveforms, respectively, similar to the error between the two pressure waveforms (4.4 ± 1.4 mm Hg).

The peripheral pressure pulse is related to the digital volume pulse by a transfer function, which is not influenced by effects of hypertension or NTG.

### Evidence for pressure-independent sympathetic modulation of central pulse wave velocity [^112sKGtz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Whether the sympathetic nervous system can directly alter central aortic stiffness remains controversial, mainly due to the difficulty in experimentally augmenting peripheral vasoconstrictor activity without changing blood pressure.

- **Methods and results**: To address this limitation, we utilized low‐level cardiopulmonary baroreflex loading and unloading, shown previously to alter sympathetic outflow without evoking parallel hemodynamic modulation. Blood pressure and carotid‐femoral aortic pulse wave velocity (cf‐) were measured in 32 healthy participants (24 ± 2 years; women: n = 15) before and during 12‐minute applications of low‐level lower body negative pressure (−7 mm Hg) and lower body positive pressure (+7 mm Hg), applied in a random order. Fibular nerve microneurography was used to collect muscle sympathetic nerve activity in a subset (n = 8) to confirm peripheral sympathetic responses.

	- During lower body negative pressure, heart rate, blood pressure, stroke volume, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance were not statistically different (all P > 0.05). Burst frequency increased by 15% (P = 0.007), total increased by 44% (P = 0.006), and cf‐ increased by ∆+0.3 ± 0.2 m/s (P > 0.05). However, blood pressure increased (P < 0.05), and pulse pressure decreased (P = 0.01). Burst frequency decreased by 4% (P = 0.37), and total decreased by 7% (P = 0.89).

### Arterial versus plethysmographic dynamic indices to test responsiveness for testing fluid administration in hypotensive patients: a clinical trial [^112tFq3m]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

In the present study, we compared indices of respiratory-induced variation obtained from direct arterial blood pressure measurement with analogous indices obtained from the plethysmogram measured by the pulse oximeter to assess the value of these indices for predicting the cardiac output increase in response to a fluid challenge. Thirty-two fluid challenges were performed in 22 hypotensive patients who were also monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter. Hemodynamic and plethysmographic data were collected before and after intravascular volume expansion.

Patients were classified as nonresponders if their cardiac index did not increase by 15% from baseline. Nonresponding patients had both lower arterial pulse variation ([10 ± 4]% vs. [19 ± 13]%, P = 0.020) and lower plethysmographic pulse variation ([12 ± 7]% vs. [21 ± 14]%, P = 0.034) when compared with responders. Fluid responsiveness was similarly predicted by arterial and plethysmographic pulse variations (area under ROC curve 0.74 vs. 0.72, respectively, P = 0.90) and by arterial and plethysmographic systolic variation (area under ROC curve 0.64 vs. 0.72, respectively, P = 0.50).

Nonresponders were identified by changes in pulse variation both on arterial and plethysmographic waveform (area under ROC curve 0.80 vs. 0.87, respectively, P = 0.40) and by changes in arterial and plethysmographic systolic variations (area under ROC curve 0.84 vs. 0.80, respectively, P = 0.76). In the population studied, plethysmographic dynamic indices of respiratory-induced variation were just as useful for predicting fluid responsiveness.

### Arterial and plethysmographic waveform analysis in anesthetized patients with hypovolemia [^114LZhqa]. Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Respiratory-induced arterial and plethysmographic (pulse oximetry) waveform changes were shown to be good predictors of cardiac output response to increased preload. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of arterial and plethysmographic waveform variables in patients with mild hypovolemia.

- **Methods**: Patients undergoing autologous hemodilution were studied. After anesthesia induction, hemodilution was performed by withdrawing blood in steps of 2% of estimated circulating blood volume (ECBV), up to 20%. Only patients who did not develop hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 80 mmHg) were included. Arterial and plethysmographic waveforms were recorded and analyzed offline at baseline and after each withdrawal of blood. Variations in arterial systolic and pulse pressure were analyzed using standard methods. Plethysmographic waveform variation and delta pulse oximetry plethysmography were determined by using pulse oximetry recordings.

- **Results**: There were 33 study participants. Systolic blood pressure decreased by 11%, and heart rate increased from 73 to 76 beats/min following a 20% reduction of ECBV. Systolic pressure and pulse pressure variations increased (P < 0.005) following a 4% reduction of ECBV. The values of arterial pressure and pulse oximetry waveform variables almost doubled in value following a 20% reduction of ECBV. Systolic pressure variation was the most reliable variable during hypovolemia. Plethysmographic waveform variation increased significantly following a 6% reduction of ECBV and delta pulse oximetry plethysmography after an 8% reduction of ECB.

### Pleth variability index versus pulse pressure variation for intraoperative goal-directed fluid therapy in patients undergoing low-to-moderate risk abdominal surgery: a randomized controlled trial [^1134hdMc]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). High credibility.

Goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT), guided by dynamic indicators of fluid responsiveness (e.g. pulse pressure variation (PPV)), has been shown to decrease postoperative complications and shorten the length of stay (LOS) during major abdominal surgery. Dynamic indicators are based on cardiopulmonary interactions during mechanical ventilation and predict fluid responsiveness better than static indicators (e.g. central venous pressure and non-invasive blood pressure).

Pulse pressure variation can guide GDFT, but it requires the insertion of an arterial catheter and its inherent risks. This is not always desirable, especially for low-to-moderate risk surgeries where blood loss and fluid shifts are minimal. In cases where the risks of an invasive catheter outweigh its potential benefits, pleth variability index (PVI) may be a valuable alternative. PVI is a totally non-invasive monitor that only requires a pulse oximeter. PVI-based GDFT has been shown to reduce postoperative lactate levels and improve postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing high-risk abdominal surgery. It is safe, easily implemented, and non-invasive.

Nevertheless, PVI's correlation to PPV has been shown to be weak during major abdominal surgery and cardiac surgery, which may be due to intraoperative or chronic changes in arteriolar compliance, sympathetic tone, and heart rate variability. In low-to-moderate risk abdominal surgery, however, such effects on arteriolar and sympathetic tone are probably less frequent, and the clinical impact of PVI remains to be determined. PVI may thus be useful in similar scenarios.

### Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and central venous pressure fail to predict ventricular filling volume, cardiac performance, or the response to volume infusion in normal subjects [^113UtweC]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and central venous pressure have been considered reliable measures of left and right ventricular preload in patients requiring invasive hemodynamic monitoring. Recent studies have questioned the correlation between these estimates of ventricular filling pressures and ventricular end-diastolic volumes or cardiac performance variables in specific patient groups. However, clinicians have continued to consider the relationship valid in a broader context. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between pressure estimates of ventricular preload (pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, central venous pressure) and end-diastolic ventricular volumes or cardiac performance in healthy volunteers.

- **Design**: Prospective, nonrandomized, nonblinded interventional study.

- **Setting**: Cardiac catheterization and echocardiography laboratories.

- **Subjects**: Normal healthy volunteers (n = 12 group 1, n = 32 group 2).

- **Interventions**: Pulmonary catheterization and radionuclide cineangiography (group 1) and volumetric echocardiography (group 2) during 3 liters of normal saline infusion over 3 hours.

- **Measurements and main results**: In group 1, the initial pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and central venous pressure did not correlate significantly with initial end-diastolic ventricular volume indexes or cardiac performance (cardiac index and stroke volume index). Changes in pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and central venous pressure following saline infusion also did not correlate with changes in end-diastolic ventricular volume indexes.

### The use of oxygen reserve index in one-lung ventilation and its impact on peripheral oxygen saturation, perfusion index and, pleth variability index [^113UnJtc]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Low credibility.

The investigators conducted the clinical study on 50 patients over a duration of 14 months. The median age of the group was 53 years, ranging from 22 to 80 years, with a gender distribution of 28 males and 22 females. The data, which is not presented here, included demographic information, co-morbidities, and pulmonary function tests of 26 patients with possible moderate to severe lung disorders, alongside details of the surgical approach and type of surgery.

Pulmonary function tests were not obtained from all patients due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hemodynamic and oximeter data, described in the methods section, were continuously monitored and collected at various phases of anesthesia and surgery. The residents performed arterial blood gas analysis at only one time point, which is the DL5 time. They were responsible for recording pulse oximetry and other oximeter values to detect hypoxemic episodes.

### Comparative efficacy of finger versus forehead plethysmographic variability index monitoring in pediatric surgical patients [^116CXFUk]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2023). Low credibility.

The Plethysmographic Variability Index (PVI) can be measured by both finger and forehead probes. Vasoconstriction may jeopardize the reliability of finger PVI measurements in pediatric patients undergoing surgery; however, the forehead vasculature shows more marked resistance to alterations in vasomotor tone.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to compare the Plethysmographic Variability Index measured via finger or forehead probes in mechanically ventilated pediatric surgery patients in terms of their ability to predict fluid responsiveness, as well as to determine the best cut-off values for these two measurements.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 50 pediatric patients undergoing minor elective surgery were included after the provision of parental consent and ethics committee approval. Perfusion index measured at the finger or forehead and PVI monitoring comprised the primary assessments. Hemodynamic parameters monitored included perfusion index, PVI, and cardiac output. A ≥ 15% increase in cardiac output following a passive leg raise maneuver was considered indicative of fluid responsiveness. Two groups were defined based on fluid responsiveness: Group R (responsive) and Group NR (non-responsive). Statistical analyses were conducted using Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, DeLong test, and ROC.

- **Results**: The area under the curve for finger and forehead Plethysmographic Variability Index prior to the passive leg raise maneuver were 0.699 (p = .011) and 0.847 (p < .001), respectively. The sensitivity for finger and forehead measurements

### Peripheral arterial tonometry-PAT technology [^113Z77L5]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) technology is a plethysmographic-based measurement method that facilitates the accurate recording of pulsatile volume changes in the arteries of peripheral vascular beds at the distal end of the fingers over sustained periods. It marks a departure from previously available plethysmographic methods as it applies a uniform pressure field that completely envelops the measured part of a digit, including its distal-most tip. Applying near-diastolic blood pressure levels within the PAT probe optimizes the signal's dynamic range, prevents confounding veno-arteriolar reflex vasoconstriction at the measurement site, and reduces respiratory and movement artifacts. This facilitates accurate long-term measurement.

The vascular bed of the distal phalanx of the finger is a major site of sympathetic nervous system-mediated vasoconstrictor activity. The PAT response to sympathetic changes provides a platform for accurate and robust measurement in various sleep and sleep-related clinical areas, primarily as a patient-friendly and extensively validated home sleep testing device.

### The increase of vasomotor tone avoids the ability of the dynamic preload indicators to estimate fluid responsiveness [^112ZACZ3]. BMC Anesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Alpha-1 agonists have the ability to both increase (by reducing venous compliance, thus converting unstressed to stressed blood volume and increasing preload) and decrease (primarily through increases in venous resistance) cardiac output (CO). The result is likely related to the dose of the drug, the reserve in unstressed blood volume, and the initial tone in the veins, all of which affect the recruitable blood volume, a critical hemodynamic reserve that cannot be measured by any monitoring device. Phenylephrine (PHE) creates countervailing effects by increasing the stressed blood volume through the recruitment of unstressed volume in the reservoir compartment, thereby increasing the venous return, and increasing the venous resistance through the mean radius decrease in the large veins, which decreases the venous return, concomitantly. Therefore, although stimulation of alpha-1 agonist receptors decreases venous capacitance and may transiently increase venous return by recruitment of unstressed to stressed blood volume, this gain may be offset by the increase in venous resistance and afterload.

Although we cannot discard a reduction of intrathoracic blood volume and/or the presence of right ventricular dysfunction during PHE infusion secondary to pulmonary hypertension, the non-significant change of left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure would support a predominant increase of vasomotor tone. Recently, Cannesson et al. demonstrated that the impact of PHE bolus on CO is related to the position of the heart on the Frank-Starling relationship and is dose-dependent. They observed that when the LV is preload independent, PHE induces a decrease.

### Pulse volume recording does not enhance segmental pressure readings for peripheral arterial disease stratification [^11322sYN]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Noninvasive vascular laboratory determinations for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) often combine pulse volume recordings (PVRs), segmental pressure readings (SPs), and Doppler waveform traces (DWs) into a single diagnostic report. Our objective was to assess the corresponding diagnostic values for each test when interpreted by four vascular specialists.

- **Methods**: A total of 2226 non-invasive diagnostic reports were reviewed through our institutional database between January 2009 and December 2011. Data from noninvasive records with corresponding angiograms performed within three months led to a cohort of 76 patients (89 limbs) for analysis. Four vascular specialists, blinded to the angiographic results, stratified the noninvasive studies as representative of normal, < 50% "subcritical", or ≥ 50% "critical" stenosis at the upper thigh, lower thigh, popliteal, and calf segments using four randomized noninvasive modalities: (1) PVR alone; (2) SP alone; (3) SP+DW; and (4) SP+DW+PVR. The angiographic records were independently graded by another three evaluators and used as a standard to determine the noninvasive diagnostic values and interobserver agreements for each modality. Statistical tests used include the Fleiss-modified kappa analysis, Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance with Dunn's multiple comparison test, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and the unpaired t-test with Welch's correction.

- **Results**: Interobserver variance for all modalities was high, except for SP. When surveying for any stenosis (< 50% and ≥ 50%), sensitivity (range 25–75%) was lower than specific.

### Pleth variability index versus pulse pressure variation for intraoperative goal-directed fluid therapy in patients undergoing low-to-moderate risk abdominal surgery: a randomized controlled trial [^114AqRCX]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). High credibility.

In patients undergoing low-to-moderate risk abdominal surgery, pleth variability index (PVI) seems to guide goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) similarly to pulse pressure variation (PPV) in regards to hospital length of stay (LOS), amount of fluid, and incidence of postoperative complications. However, in low-risk patients undergoing these surgical procedures, optimizing stroke volume may have limited impact on outcome.

### Arterial waveform analysis for the anesthesiologist: past, present, and future concepts [^111ETmAz]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2011). Low credibility.

Qualitative arterial waveform analysis has been in existence for millennia. However, quantitative arterial waveform analysis techniques, which can be traced back to Euler's work in the 18th century, have not been widely used by anesthesiologists and other clinicians. This is likely attributable, in part, to the widespread use of the sphygmomanometer, which allows practitioners to assess arterial blood pressure without developing a sense for the higher-order characteristics of the arterial waveform. The 20-year delay in the development of devices that measure these traits is a testament to the primitiveness of our appreciation for this information.

The shape of the peripheral arterial pressure waveform may indeed contain information useful to the anesthesiologist and intensivist. The maximal slope of the peripheral arterial pressure tracing seems to be related to left ventricular contractility, although the relationship may be confounded by other hemodynamic variables. The area under the peripheral arterial pressure tracing is related to stroke volume when loading conditions are stable; this finding has been used in the development of several continuous cardiac output monitors.

Pulse wave velocity may be related to vascular impedance and could potentially improve the accuracy of waveform-based stroke volume estimates. Estimates of central arterial pressures (e.g. aortic) can be produced from peripheral (e.g. brachial, radial) tracings using a generalized transfer function and are incorporated into the algorithms of several continuous cardiac output monitors.

### Nitro-time [^114MHfTy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin involves the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and the consequent dilation of peripheral arteries and veins, particularly the veins. This dilation promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation decreases systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Coronary artery dilation also occurs.

The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilation remains undefined. Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to maintain plasma concentrations continuously above a minimally effective concentration; however, this strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates.

- **Exercise testing**: Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the anti-anginal efficacy of continuously-delivered nitrates. In most trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far exceeding those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates had been absent from the body for several hours was their anti-anginal efficacy restored.

### Estimation of central arterial pressure from the radial artery in patients undergoing invasive neuroradiological procedures [^117WwZ6n]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Low credibility.

Using data obtained during left heart catheterization in cardiac patients, Romano et al. previously showed that each point of the pressure waveform could be used to reconstruct the central aortic pressure using a multiple linear regression model to generate a transfer function from the periphery to the aorta. The multi-linear regression analysis was performed on a dataset of 123 measurements from 41 cardiac patients undergoing heart catheterization. Peripheral and central pressure waves were recorded simultaneously in each patient (three pulsations each separated by 30 s). To work in the time domain, the single pulsations from peripheral and central records were interpolated linearly. The two signals were put in phase, and the pressure and pulsation waveforms were analyzed.

From each beat, samples were interpolated on a 1024-point grid. For each point, a linear multiple regression was computed to obtain the single aortic waveform from the peripheral one. For each variable (SAP rec, DAP rec, and Dic rec), the same formula was used: Pₐₒ = a₀ ± a₁ × b₁ ± a₂ × b₂ ± a₃ × b₃ ±… where aᵢ (i = n-1) are constants, and bⱼ (j = n) are variables. For each point of the recorded peripheral pulse waveform, the reported multiple linear regression was applied. Independent variables included the radial pressure at the corresponding point, its first and second derivative, each point integral of radial systolic, diastolic, dicrotic, and pulse pressure, heart rate, cardiac cycle efficiency, and Z (t1 instability).

### Evidence for pressure-independent sympathetic modulation of central pulse wave velocity [^111rPE6v]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Whether the sympathetic nervous system can directly alter central aortic stiffness remains controversial, mainly because of the difficulty in experimentally augmenting peripheral vasoconstrictor activity without changing blood pressure.

- **Methods and results**: To address this limitation, we utilized low-level cardiopulmonary baroreflex loading and unloading, shown previously to alter sympathetic outflow without evoking parallel hemodynamic modulation. Blood pressure and carotid-femoral aortic pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV) were measured in 32 healthy participants (24 ± 2 years; women: n = 15) before and during 12-minute applications of low-level lower body negative pressure (-7 mm Hg) and lower body positive pressure (+7 mm Hg), applied in a random order. Fibular nerve microneurography was used to collect muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in a subset (n = 8) to confirm peripheral sympathetic responses.

During lower body negative pressure, heart rate, blood pressure, stroke volume, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance were not statistically different (all P > 0.05); however, MSNA burst frequency (+15%; P = 0.007), total MSNA (+44%; P = 0.006), and cf-PWV (∆+0.3 ± 0.2 m/s; P < 0.05) increased. Conversely, during lower body positive pressure, MSNA and cf-PWV were not different (P > 0.05), though blood pressure increased (P < 0.05) and pulse pressure decreased (P = 0.01).

### The use of oxygen reserve index in one-lung ventilation and its impact on peripheral oxygen saturation, perfusion index, and pleth variability index [^113wb4FH]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Low credibility.

The study investigates the use of the oxygen reserve index (ORi) in one-lung ventilation and its impact on peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO₂), perfusion index (PI), and pleth variability index (PVI).

- **Median values and interquartile range of PI and PVI**: Median values and interquartile range of PI and PVI are recorded at different measurement points during surgery, including double-lung ventilation (DLV) and one-lung ventilation (OLV). Measurement points are as follows: under mechanical ventilation 5 minutes after intubation in the supine position (DS5), after 5 minutes of mechanical ventilation in the lateral decubitus position (DL5), and various time points during one-lung ventilation: 1 minute (OLV1), 2 minutes (OLV2), 5 minutes (OLV5), 10 minutes (OLV10), 15 minutes (OLV15), 30 minutes (OLV30), 45 minutes (OLV45), 60 minutes (OLV60), and 90 minutes (OLV90).

- **Time-dependent correlations**: Table 4 provides data on the time-dependent correlations between ORi and SpO₂, PI, and PVI. Significant correlations were found at certain time points: at DS5 (r = 0.286, p = 0.044), DL5 (r = 0.293, p = 0.039), and at OLV10, where ORi has a significant correlation with SpO₂ (r = 0.360, p = 0.011). At the time point DS5, ORi has a significant negative correlation with PI (r = -0.332, p = 0.019). No significant correlations with PVI were noted.

### Plethysmographic variability index (PVI) accuracy in predicting fluid responsiveness in anesthetized children [^112JaKU5]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Plethysmographic Variability Index (PVI) has been shown to accurately predict responsiveness to fluid loads in adults. The goal of this study was to evaluate PVI accuracy when predicting fluid responsiveness during noncardiac surgery in children.

- **Material and methods**: Children aged 2–10 years scheduled for noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia were included. PVI was assessed concomitantly with stroke volume index (SVI). A response to fluid load was defined by an SVI increase of more than 15%. A 10 ml·kg(-1) normal saline intravenous fluid challenge was administered before surgical incision and after anesthetic induction. After incision, fluid challenges were administered when SVI values decreased by more than 15% or where judged necessary by the anesthesiologist. Statistical analyses include receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and the determination of gray zone method with an error tolerance of 10%.

- **Results**: Fifty-four patients were included, with 97 fluid challenges administered and 45 responses recorded. The area under the curve of ROC curves was 0.85 [0.77–0.93] and 0.8 [0.7–0.89] for baseline PVI and SVI values, respectively. Corresponding gray zone limits were [10–17%] and [22–31 ml·m(-2)], respectively. PVI values exhibited different gray zone limits for pre-incision and post-incision fluid challenges, whereas SVI values were comparable. PVI value percentages in the gray zone were 34% overall and 44% for challenges performed after surgical incision.

- **Discussion**: This study found both PVI and pre-challenge SVI to be accurate when used to predict fluid responsiveness in anesthetized children during noncardiac surgery.

### Dynamic changes in arterial waveform derived variables and fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients: A systematic review of the literature [^111yuDtN]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

- **Objectives**: A systematic review of the literature to determine the ability of dynamic changes in arterial waveform-derived variables to predict fluid responsiveness and compare these with static indices of fluid responsiveness. The assessment of a patient's intravascular volume is one of the most difficult tasks in critical care medicine. Conventional static hemodynamic variables have proven unreliable as predictors of volume responsiveness. Dynamic changes in systolic pressure, pulse pressure, and stroke volume in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation have emerged as useful techniques to assess volume responsiveness.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, and citation review of relevant primary and review articles.

- **Study selection**: Clinical studies that evaluated the association between stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation, and/or stroke volume variation and the change in stroke volume/cardiac index following a fluid or positive end-expiratory pressure challenge.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Data were abstracted on study design, study size, study setting, patient population, and the correlation coefficient and/or receiver operating characteristic between the baseline systolic pressure variation, stroke volume variation, and/or pulse pressure variation and the change in stroke index/cardiac index following a fluid challenge. When reported, the receiver operating characteristic of the central venous pressure, global end-diastolic volume index, and left ventricular end-diastolic area index were also recorded.
