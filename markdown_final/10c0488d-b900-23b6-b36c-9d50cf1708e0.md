## Question

Example 1. Calculate the side length of a square inscribed in the ellipse [x²/a²] + [y²/b²] = 1. (Problem 14, Page 171)

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to calculate the side length of a square inscribed in the ellipse defined by the equation x²/a² + y²/b² = 1. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the symmetry of the ellipse and how that constrains the orientation of an inscribed square. Then, I should set up the vertices of the square in a coordinate system that respects that symmetry. Next, I will substitute those vertex coordinates into the ellipse equation to derive a constraint on the side length. After that, I should solve the resulting equation for the side length in terms of a and b. Finally, I will verify the solution and consider special cases to ensure consistency with geometric intuition.

> Let me first confirm the symmetry argument. An ellipse centered at the origin has reflection symmetry across both axes and rotational symmetry, so any inscribed square must also be centered at the origin and aligned with the axes; otherwise, its vertices would not lie on the ellipse under those symmetries, which would violate the inscription condition. Wait, let me verify that I'm not overgeneralizing; for a general conic, a square could potentially be rotated, but for the standard ellipse x²/a² + y²/b² = 1, the maximal inscribed square indeed has sides parallel to the axes, so I can proceed with axis-aligned vertices without loss of generality for this problem [^notfound].

> I will now examine the vertex coordinates. If the square is axis-aligned and centered, its vertices can be written as (± s/2, ± s/2), where s is the side length. Hold on, I should verify that these points satisfy the ellipse equation; substituting (s/2, s/2) into x²/a² + y²/b² = 1 gives (s/2)²/a² + (s/2)²/b² = 1, which simplifies to s²/4 (1/a² + 1/b²) = 1. This is the key constraint linking s to a and b, and it ensures all four vertices lie on the ellipse [^notfound].

> Next, I should solve for s. From s²/4 (1/a² + 1/b²) = 1, I can isolate s² to get s² = 4 / (1/a² + 1/b²). Let me simplify the denominator: 1/a² + 1/b² = (a² + b²)/(a²b²), so s² = 4a²b²/(a² + b²). Taking the square root, s = 2ab/√(a² + b²). I should double-check the algebra; yes, that simplification is correct, and the final expression is dimensionally consistent, with units of length as expected [^notfound].

> But wait, what if a = b? In that case the ellipse becomes a circle of radius a, and the inscribed square should have side length a√2. Let me verify consistency: substituting a = b into s = 2ab/√(a² + b²) gives s = 2a²/√(2a²) = 2a²/(a√2) = a√2, which matches the known result for a circle, so the formula behaves correctly in this special case [^notfound].

> I should also consider the geometric interpretation. The expression s = 2ab/√(a² + b²) shows that the side length is a harmonic mean–like combination of a and b, scaled by 2. Intuitively, when one axis is much larger than the other, the square is constrained by the smaller dimension, and s approaches twice the smaller semiaxis, which makes sense because the square must fit within the narrowest part of the ellipse [^notfound].

> Final answer: The side length of the largest square that can be inscribed in the ellipse x²/a² + y²/b² = 1 is s = 2ab/√(a² + b²). I should confirm that this is the maximal inscribed square; given the symmetry and the fact that any rotation would push vertices outside the ellipse for the same side length, this is indeed the maximal solution, and the derivation is complete [^notfound].

---

The side length of the largest square inscribed in the ellipse [x²/a²] + [y²/b²] = 1 is [2ab/√(a² + b²)]. This result comes from placing the square's vertices at (±[s/2], ±[s/2]) and substituting into the ellipse equation, which yields s = [2ab/√(a² + b²)].

---

## Geometric setup

Let the ellipse be centered at the origin with semi-major axis (a) and semi-minor axis (b). The square is centered at the origin, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The vertices of the square are at (±[s/2], ±[s/2]), where (s) is the side length.

---

## Substitution into the ellipse equation

Substitute the vertex coordinates into the ellipse equation:

[(s/2)²/a²] + [(s/2)²/b²] = 1

Simplify:

[s²/4a²] + [s²/4b²] = 1

Factor out ([s²/4]):

[s²/4] ([1/a²] + [1/b²]) = 1

Combine the fractions:

[s²/4] × [(a² + b²)/(a²b²)] = 1

Solve for (s²):

s² = [4a²b²/(a² + b²)]

Take the square root:

s = [2ab/√(a² + b²)]

---

## Verification

This result is consistent with known special cases:

- **Circle**: If (a = b = r), then s = [2r²/√(2r²)] = [2r²/(r√2)] = r√2, which is the side length of a square inscribed in a circle of radius (r).
- **Degenerate ellipse**: If (a ≫ b), then s ≈ [2ab/a] = 2b, meaning the square is constrained by the minor axis.

---

## Conclusion

The side length of the largest square inscribed in the ellipse [x²/a²] + [y²/b²] = 1 is [2ab/√(a² + b²)].

### Spatial distribution of B cells and lymphocyte clusters as a predictor of triple-negative breast cancer outcome [^9f46f256]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Spatial distribution analysis of TILs

Using the data spreadsheets with every cell phenotyped and given a set of Cartesian coordinates, we tiled each image with a grid of identical squares. We omitted squares that had no cells, since they lay outside the tissue. However, we included squares that were within the tissue but contained no cells of interest. The length L of one side of a square varies from 10 to 600 μm. A square was assigned 1 or 0 according to the answer to a binary question. For comparison we calculated the occupancy FD of a uniform random (Poisson) distribution of points. We processed the data using in-house custom-developed software (RStudio) and the R packages "spatstat" for point patterns, "dbscan" for cluster analysis, and "EBImage" for raster images.

Statistical methods

Occupancy,

An image is overlaid with a grid of squares (Fig. 2a); each square has an area of L 2. A '0' or '1' is assigned to each square according to the answer to a binary (yes-no) question, e.g. "Is there at least one B cell in the square?" (Fig. 2a inset). The occupancy is the fraction of squares with 1's, i.e. it is an estimate of the probability that a square will have a 1. To characterize the spatial distribution at different length scales, the size of the squares in the grid is varied to produce the occupancy as a function of L, the length of one side of a square. The occupancy depends to some extent on the average cell density for binary questions such as "Is there at least one CD20 + B cell in the square?" because a higher average cell density corresponds to a higher probability that a square is assigned a '1'.

### LinkedSV for detection of mosaic structural variants from linked-read exome and genome sequencing data [^543c05fe]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Quantification of type 1 evidence

Let n be the number of points in the square region. Each point corresponds to a pair of fragment F i 1, F i 2, (i = 1, 2, 3,…, n) that may support the SV. Let b 1 and b 2 be the coordinates of the predicted breakpoint. Eqs. (1) and (2) hold for all the fragment pairs F i 1, F i 2 (i = 1, 2, 3,…, n). We then test the null hypothesis that there is no SV between b 1 and b 2.

First, we test the hypothesis that the n fragment pairs F i 1, F i 2 have originated from different DNA molecules, but coincidently received the same barcode. Here, we define two fragments F a and F b as an independent fragment pair if F a and F b share the same barcode but have originated from different DNA molecules. Thus, R (F a) and L (F b) are independent variables. All the fragment pairs that do not support SVs are independent fragment pairs. It is reasonable to assume the generation of HMW DNA molecules from chromosomal DNA is a random process thus both R (F a) and L (F b) are uniformly distributed across the chromosome. Therefore, the point ((R (F a), L (F b)) is equal likely to be in any place in the two-dimensional plane. Technically, we connect all the chromosomes in a head-to-tail order so that both intra-chromosomal events and interchromosomal can be analyzed at the same time. Observing at least n independent fragment pairs meeting Eq. (2) is equivalent to the event that observing at least n points ((R (F i 1), L (F i 2)) located in a squared region with an area of G 2 on the two-dimensional plane. The probability of this event iswhere Binomial_pmf is the probability mass function of binomial distribution; L is the total length of the genome (also the side length of the two-dimensional plane); N ifp is the total number of independent fragment pairs.

### Characterizing cell-type spatial relationships across length scales in spatially resolved omics data [^d4079785]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Methods

CRAWDAD overview

CRAWDAD characterizes cell-type spatial relationship trends by comparing observed pairwise cell-type spatial relationships to a set of empirical null distributions in which cell-type labels have been shuffled at different length scales.

Creating null distributions at different length scales

To generate empirical null distributions against which observed cell-type spatial relationships can be compared to evaluate for statistical significance, CRAWDAD employs a grid-based cell-type label shuffling strategy. Given a tissue containing cells represented by x-y spatial coordinates with cell-type annotations, we partition the tissue into non-overlapping side-by-side tiles. By default, tiles are squares of area r 2, where r is the size of the spatial length scale of analysis. Then for all cells that reside within the same square, cell-type labels are shuffled to create a null distribution for the given r. These shuffled null distributions are created for multiple r values to achieve a set of empirical null distribution at different length scales. We further create multiple permutations at each length scale by applying different random seeds and a grid-offsetting approach to mitigate the influence of spatial patterns that would benefit specific grid divisions. Specifically, the offsets are calculated by creating a sequence from 0 to r, in equally spaced intervals of r divided by the number of permutations. In each of the permutations, a different offset of the sequence will be applied. In addition to square tiles, CRAWDAD allows the creation of side-by-side non-overlapping hexagon tiles. In this case, the size of the scale is represented by the distance between opposite edges of the hexagon (Supp. Fig. 9a).

### Collective self-caging of active filaments in virtual confinement [^e5ed295e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Table 1
Simulation parameters corresponding to the data shown in the main text (unless specified otherwise)

For sufficiently large U 0 and d, filaments experience strong repulsive forces that prevent overlaps and thus reproduce a strictly 2D confinement. Decreasing either of these two parameters, we observe crossing between filaments similar to those reported in the experiments (see Fig. 1 d). Lowering U 0 at fixed d = σ /2 for the filament density used in our simulations, this transition quickly leads to a vanishing of the interactions between filaments, leading to structureless aggregates in the illuminated region. On the other hand, decreasing d at fixed U 0 allows for a larger intermediate regime where filaments can cross each other while still effectively aligning nematically when their density reaches large enough values. As discussed in the main text and shown in Fig. 3, this regime where 0.15 ≲ d / σ ≲ 0.35 precisely corresponds to the emergence of nontrivial patterns at the illumination boundary.

The data presented in Fig. 2 d was obtained by varying the radius of the illuminated disk in the range [5 σ; 80 σ] while keeping the system size fixed. In Fig. 4, we illustrate various geometries with the following specifications: ellipse with major and minor radii of 55 σ and 40 σ, respectively (a), ellipse with major and minor radii of 66 σ and 15 σ, respectively (b), square of side length 50 σ (c), trapezoid with height 55 σ, length of the first base 124 σ, and of the second base 62 σ (d), equilateral triangle with height 80 σ (e), and a teardrop made from one equilateral triangle with height 80 σ and a semicircle with radius 23 σ (f).

### A quantitative analysis of various patterns applied in lattice light sheet microscopy [^fb4edadd]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

For MB-square lattices, an additional tuning parameter is the spacing of the multi-Bessel array, which determines the position of the two side beamlets in the back pupil. While this is technically a free parameter, we find that the most uniform beam is achieved by choosing a beam spacing such that the two side beamlets inscribe the inner annulus. In this particular configuration, all four beamlets of the MB-square lattice will share the same Δk y, leading to the same propagation length at the specimen, and thus a highly consistent excitation profile along the propagation direction. In fact, varying the spacing of the multi-Bessel array can also lead to a shift in the OTF support from a more Gaussian-like light sheet to a more lattice-like light sheet. As demonstrated in Fig. S 6, shifting the two side beamlets inward such that they become clipped by the inner annulus of the mask leads to a more hex-like light sheet with decreased axial FWHM in the overall PSF and increased modulation in the excitation profile (Fig. S 6e, f, i–l), while shifting the two side beamlets outwards lead to a more Gaussian-like light sheet (Fig. S 6g, h, i–l).

### Magnetization transfer and frequency distribution effects in the SSFP ellipse [^89a503f0]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

P represents the RF pulse, including excitation of the free pool by the angle α, rotation by a phase increment ϕ j, and saturation of the bound pool by the factor E W = exp (− WT RF). T RF is the length of the RF pulse, and W is the saturation rate: G 0 is the value of the lineshape at resonance, p 1 is the ratio of the pulse's mean B 1 to the maximum B 1, and p 2 is the ratio of the mean B 1 2 to the maximum B 1 2. 11, 12 The factors p 1 and p 2 describe the shape of the RF pulse relative to a block pulse, and provide a simple way to scale the saturation rate for different flip angles and pulse lengths (the saturation rate of a block pulse simply scales with flip angle squared and the inverse square of pulse‐length). We assumed a fixed value of G 0 = 14 μs, which is the extrapolation of the Super‐Lorentzian from an off‐resonance value of 1 kHz to zero. 5, 13 Strictly, the lineshape should be evaluated at the local off‐resonance value; however at 3T, the highest off‐resonance values in the human brain are approximately 100 Hz which is well below the 1 kHz value at which the Super‐Lorentzian is assumed to be flat. Finally, we define the following useful terms, similar to Equation 11 of Gloor et al 5 :We then define the magnetizations before and after the RF pulse asand then calculate the steady‐state solution at the echo time TE = TR /2:where the termrepresents relaxation and accrued off‐resonance between the RF pulse and TE. The complex‐valued steady‐state magnetization is then:where θ = ψ + ϕ n. This can be converted to the elliptical form 6 where

### Drug screening at single-organoid resolution via bioprinting and interferometry [^91d2c710]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

3D printing plasma masks

Custom well masks were designed to meet the specifications of the well plates that were used in these experiments (Supplementary Fig. 1). The design was generated in Inventor 2020 (Autodesk) and printed using a Form3B (FormLabs) using the Biomed Amber resin (FormLabs). The design was exported as an STL file and imported into the PreForm (FormLabs) software to arrange the parts. After printing, parts were post-processed in two washes of isopropanol, air-dried for at least 30 minutes, and cured for an additional 30 minutes at 70 °C in the Form Cure (FormLabs).

Bioprinted 3D organoids

Cells were bioprinted using a CELLINK BioX with a Temperature-Controlled Printhead. G-code files were written to print the desired single-layer geometry. MATLAB (MathWorks) was used to integrate these standardized blocks into full G-code files with the defined coordinates for each well. 8-well plates were used when printing the maxi-rings for IHC and RNAseq as the depth of the well in a standard 24-well plate prohibited the use of 0.5" length needles. For each time point, four rings with a diameter of 14.5 mm were printed for RNAseq (~ 2 × 10 5 cells total), while four sets of concentric 14.5 mm, 12.5 mm, and 10.5 mm diameter rings were used for IHC analysis (~ 5 × 10 5 cells total). Mini-squares with side length 3.9 mm were printed into glass-bottom plates (Cellvis P96-1.5H-N) for drug screening and HSLCI imaging. The mini-squares were inscribed within the circular well with sides parallel to the sides of the well plate. All bioprinting processes utilized the same material deposited for manually seeded organoids: a single-cell suspension in a 3:4 mixture of Mammocult and Matrigel on ice. After vortexing briefly, the mixture was transferred into a 3 mL syringe to remove air bubbles. The mixture was then transferred to a room temperature 3 mL bioprinter cartridge (CELLINK) by connecting the syringe and cartridge with a double-sided female Luer lock adapter (CELLINK). The loaded cartridge was incubated in a rotating incubator (Enviro-Genie, Scientific Industries) for 30 minutes at the print temperature.

### The 30-degree angle revisited [^eec48357]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The standard surgical ellipse, with 30 degrees apical angles and a length-to-width ratio of 2 or 3 to 1, works optimally on a flat surface. The same pattern, when used for excisions on strongly convex or concave surfaces, leads to distortions which may require significant revisions. The reason for these discrepancies is explainable by the mathematical differences between flat Euclidian geometry and curved non-Euclidian geometry. Understanding these basic mathematical principles as applied to cutaneous surgery should lead to better preoperative planning, fewer intraoperative surprises, and more pleasing results.

### Covalently-assembled single-chain protein nanostructures with ultra-high stability [^2bd312f3]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Coarse-grained simulations of protein nanostructures

We developed a phenomenological, rods-and-springs coarse-grained model to perform simulations of triangular and square nanostructures. A schematic of the model for triangular nanostructures is shown in Supplementary Fig. 10. In the rod-and-springs representation, residues 6–238 of 3HB are modeled as rigid rods. These rods are of fixed length 114.32 Å, which corresponds to the distance between the two alpha carbons of residues 6 and 238 in the 3HB crystal structure. The rigid rod model is based on the assumption that the rod is not significantly distorted when compared to the flexible tethers, at least on experimentally relevant time scales. The linkers are modeled as Gaussian chains with an elastic energy written in terms of a harmonic potential:note the factor of 2, which is appropriate given that the dimensionality is 2 for planar structures. Here, R 0 is determined by regression analysis where a second-order polynomial f (x) = A –3(x / R 0) 2 is used to fit the PMF written in terms of the end-to-end distances extracted from atomistic simulations. The regression analysis yields linker specific values for R 0 and these are used in the coarse-grained simulations.

Starting from an initial default structure, which is an equilateral triangle or square with side length of 114.32 Å, a MC procedure was used to equilibrate the system. At each MC step, one side is randomly picked among three and tilted by a random angle variable that follows a Gaussian distribution of mean 0 and standard deviation 0.1°. Then the tip-to-tip distance x is converted into the Gaussian chain energy E (x). The Gaussian chain energy is calculated for every linker, and the system energy is obtained by a simple sum of all 3 or 4 linker contributions. If the trial move gives lower energy, the program accepts the move. Otherwise, it accepts the move according to the Metropolis MC criterion. We performed 100 independent simulations for triangular structures, each of which consists of 10 7 MC steps, and the coordinates were registered every 10 4 steps, discarding the first 5 × 10 5 steps. For square structures, we also performed 100 simulations, but the step number was increased to 10 9 and we discarded the first 10 8 MC steps. The distributions of bending angles were constructed from the coordinate information, from which the standard deviation was also calculated.

### Multilayer block copolymer meshes by orthogonal self-assembly [^a9b06266]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

The single chain partition function can be evaluated as follows

where q (r, s) is a restricted chain partition function (propagator) that could be calculated by solving a modified diffusion equation

subjected to the initial condition q (r, 0) = 1. As the two ends of the polymer are distinct, a complementary partition function q * (r, s) is defined similarly and satisfies the same modified diffusion equation with an initial condition q *(r, 1) = 1. Here, we utilized s as a chain contour variable in units of N. All lengths were expressed in units of the unperturbed radius-of-gyration of a polymer, R g = (Nb 2 /6) 1/2, where b is the statistical segment length. The solution to the modified diffusion equation was conducted by implementing the pseudo-spectral method. An iterative relaxation of the fields towards their saddle-point values was implemented following ref.

By evaluating q (r, s) and its complementary function, the segment volume fractions can be determined as follows

Here we considered a 2D rectangular domain of size (L x × L y = 24 × 14R g 2). The SCFT equations were solved on a grid that had an equal lattice spacing of 0.2R g in the x and y directions. The volume fraction of the polymer f A was set to 0.5, whereas the degree of incompatibility χN was 17. This resulted in a structure that had the form of stripes (2D projection of in-plane cylinders or out-of-plane lamellae). The sides of the computational cell had periodic boundary conditions simulating an unconfined system in the x direction. Confinement was applied to the top and bottom surfaces where both have equal affinity to block A.

Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. Good (blue) outcome curve is consistently higher than poor (red) outcome curve. c Plots showing occupancy area under the curve (AUC) for CD20 + B cells in stroma is higher for good (n = 24) vs. poor (n = 12) outcome (p = 0.05).

The fractal dimension is larger for good clinical outcome vs. poor outcome at large length scales, but this trend is reversed at small length scales. At long length scales (200–600 μm on the left side of the plot), mean fractal dimension s (slope) is 1.3 for good outcome (blue), 1.11 for poor outcome (red), 0.92 for normal tissue (gray), and 2.08 for Poisson (black). The p value for good vs. poor outcome is 0.08 at long length scales. At short length scales (10–40 μm on the right side of the plot), the mean fractal dimension is 0.58 for good outcome, 0.65 for poor outcome, 0.30 for normal tissue, and 0.15 for Poisson. The p value for good vs. poor outcome is 0.5 at short length scales. Black dashed lines show least-squares linear regression fit at long and short length scales. Because different images have different overall areas, fractal dimension is calculated by normalizing the number n(L) of boxes with 1's with the total number N(L) of boxes with cells. Thus the y-axis values are negative. The error bars correspond to 95% confidence intervals. e Example illustrating how FD difference indicates whether cells are spread out or clustered. The left image with four quadrants shows four blue points that are spatially spread out in the upper two quadrants while the right image with four quadrants shows four clustered red points in the upper two quadrants. At long length scales (big boxes in left 2 quadrants), the big squares in the lower left quadrant have more 1 s in the left image than in the lower left quadrant of the right image because the blue points in the upper left quadrant are more spread out compared to the red points in the upper left quadrant of the right image, so the fractal dimension is larger in the left half of left image than in the left half of the right image. At small length scales (small boxes in 2 right quadrants), the upper right quadrants of both images have the same number of points and occupy the same number of squares; hence, the blue and red points have the same fractal dimension at small length scales. So the difference in fractal dimension between large and small length scales will be larger for the spatially dispersed blue points than for the clustered red points. f Plot showing that the FD difference for stromal CD20 + B cells is significantly higher in good outcome (p = 3 × 10 −3, ROC AUC = 0.77), indicating that B cells are more spatially dispersed in the stroma in good outcome.

### Thiophene-fused aromatic belts [^521e40fa]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Crystal structures and packing of thiophene belts

Suitable single crystals of 1 and 2 were obtained from solutions of dichloromethane for 1 and chlorobenzene for 2, respectively. Their structures were successfully determined using X-ray crystallography. As shown in Figs. 2 a, 1 and 2 adopt belt-shaped and truncated conical structures (C 8v and C 9v symmetries, respectively). These unique shapes result from a structure in which only one side of the CPP backbone is cross-linked with sulfur atoms. The taper angles of the conical structures in each thiophene belt are 50° for 1 and 58° for 2, respectively. Consistent with the DFT calculation results, the angle increases with increasing belt size. The measured diameters of the inscribed and circumscribed circles in the observed structures of thiophene belts are 8.67 Å and 12.9 Å for 1, 9.75 Å and 14.2 Å for 2, respectively (Fig. 2a and b, center and right). Another interesting feature of thiophene belts is that they are neutral, yet significantly polar molecules because the sulfur atoms are clustered on one side of the belts. According to DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6–31 G(d) level of theory with dispersion correction of Grimme's D3, the electrostatic potential map shows that the negative potential density is concentrated on the sulfur side. In addition, 1 is estimated to have a dipole moment of 8.21 Debye and 2 has that of 8.92 Debye. The results show that polarity increases with the increasing number of sulfur atoms with the cone-shaped nanobelt structures (Fig. 2e, also see Fig. S20 and S21).

### Neural correlates of top-down modulation of haptic shape versus roughness perception [^f173126d]. Human Brain Mapping (2019). Medium credibility.

2.2 Stimuli

The stimuli were cuboids that differed in their shape (oblongness) and roughness. They were produced by 3D printing (Object30Pro, Stratasys, material VeroClear, nominal resolution 600–1,600 dpi). With regard to shape, the cuboids had the same diagonal length (d = 56.57 mm) and width (w = 30 mm) but differed in the relative length of their sides such that five different levels of oblongness were created (lengths of the shorter/longer side 40.0/40.0, 35.6/44.0, 31.2/47.2, 26.8/49.8, 22.4/51.9 mm; see Figure 1). Stimuli were always presented in the same orientation, that is, with the shorter side facing towards the participant (Figure 1 b). The surface of each cuboid possessed a certain roughness. Roughness was defined as one‐dimensional (1D) square‐wave function with an amplitude of 0.3 mm and was varied on five levels by groove widths of 0.25, 0.34, 0.42, 0.51, or 0.59 mm, respectively. Ridge width always equaled groove width. In every trial, a standard (31.2 mm length for shape, 0.42 mm groove width for roughness) had to be judged against a comparison stimulus (1 of the 5 levels of roughness/shape).

### Feasibility ofP spectroscopic imaging at 7 T in lung carcinoma patients [^e9fdc3e1]. NMR in Biomedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

2.3 Patients & setup

Four stage III‐IV non‐small cell lung carcinoma patients (ages: 53–63 years; BMI: 17.7–29.5 Kg/m 2) were included in this feasibility study and signed informed consent prior to scanning. Two patients participated after their palliative chemo‐ and/or radiotherapy sessions and two patients participated after the first immunotherapy cycle (see Table 1 for details). Patients were scanned in supine position. Scans of two patients were acquired with the 31 P dual coil Rx (A1) placed on the location closest to the tumor based on previously acquired clinical CT images for tumor localization. The other two patients were scanned with the 31 P Rx array (A2), that was wrapped around the upper part of their torso. The two separate dipole antennas in A1 are positioned on the side and the top of the lung of interest. Maximum tumor dimension ranged from 25 mm to 75 mm and other clinical details per patient are shown in Table 1.

### Larmor frequency shift from magnetized cylinders with arbitrary orientation distribution [^b59b3ad6]. NMR in Biomedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

3 METHODS

3.1 Simulations: validation of modeling

We designed three sets of simulations to validate our theory. We investigated (a) the influence of the size and shape of the mesoscopic Lorentz cavitywhen calculating the mesoscopic averaged Larmor frequency, Equation (8) through Equations (12) and (13), for different microstructural configurations and (b) the accuracy of calculating the MRI Larmor frequency using Equation (21) in a sample with slowly varying magnetic microstructure and run using different inclusion sizes compared with. Finally, we investigated (c) the validity of the proposed mesoscopic kernel, Equation (43), for a distribution of cylinders. All simulations were done in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA).

3.1.1 Random packing of cylinders or spheres

Non‐overlapping cylinders or spheres were packed in a sample represented by a cubic volume of side length, with radiidrawn from a gamma distribution with mean and standard deviation (SD). The positions(parameterized as in Appendix B.1 for cylinders) were randomly generated from a uniform distribution, and the packing was stopped once the inclusions occupied a chosen volume fraction in the sample. For cylinders, various levels of orientation dispersion were achieved by only generating cylinders within an allowed polar‐angle range, set by a given cut‐offThis generated a uniform distribution of orientations up toThe sample was subsequently discretized on a 3D grid, with a resolution set by the number of grid points. The indicator functionon the discretized grid was then Fourier transformed to yield the indicator functionin k ‐space, which in turn was used to compute the correlation function, Equation (19). We computed the local Larmor frequency, Equation (1), by multiplyingby the dicretized dipole kernel, Equation (3), and Fourier transforming back to image space. The mesoscopic dipole tensor, Equation (18), was computed by integrating the product of the dipole kernel and the correlation function, and dividing the result by the volume fractionof the discretized grid. The external field is normalized so, and chosen to be alongto maximize effect size.

Common Volume Geometric Methods Used in the Clinic

Composite midpoint integration method

The commonly used composite midpoint integration method applies to parallel stacks of short‐axis image planes that, ideally, encompass the entire extent of the LV from the mitral valve annulus to the apex (Figure 1). The LVV is estimated by multiplying the observed cavity area on each slice, A, times the slice thickness, h, to get the volume contribution of each slice, and summing these over all slices (Eqn. 1 in Figure 1). This "stack of disks" approach is also commonly referred to as the Simpson's Rule; however, in mathematics the Simpson's Rule refers specifically to integration using quadric polynomials. 22 In this article, the in‐plane cavity area was computed numerically from the user‐selected LV endocardial contour, but in the clinic is often approximated from 1 or 2 user‐defined diameter measurements and a circular or elliptical model for the in‐plane area. A common variant implemented by Wyatt et al 17 models the most apical aspect of the LV as a hemisphere that emanates from the bottom half of the most apical slice (Eqn. 2 in Figure 1).

B (bottom), Gives a variant from Wyatt et al 17 intended to correct for curvature effects at the apex. The sum is over all slices except the apex, then adds half the apex volume plus the volume of a hemisphere of radius equal to half the slice thickness.

### Universality in long-distance geometry and quantum complexity [^47f080b3]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

A careful analysis, confirms this picture and shows that the very largest additive discrepancy from thedistance is found near the cut locus, so for all U and, As, theandBerger spheres agree on distances to within a picometre. (A two-dimensional example that shows the same phenomenon is given in Supplementary Information 3).

Finally, let us examine the role of curvature. At large, the metric becomes strongly curved: the easy–easy section becomes very negatively curved, and the easy–hard sections become very positively curved. We call the σ x and σ y directions easy because they are cheap to move it, whereas the σ z direction is hard to move in for. The curvature length, which is also the distance to the cut locus in the hard direction, becomes very short. The high curvature explains how the metric can hide lots of volume at short distances that are invisible at long distances. Consider an operational definition of volume that counts how many marbles can be packed into the space: if we can cram in n (r) marbles each of radius r, then the volume is proportional to. Although the volume grows without bound as, the effective volume n (r) r 3 at any finite value of r does not. Instead, the effective volume grows like r −1 as we take r smaller and only levels off atonce r is less than the curvature length. Thus even asthe effective volume, as probed by experiments with finite resolution, stays finite.

Euclidean group

Consider parallel parking a unicycle.

The unicycle starts facing parallel to the curb and ends facing parallel to the curb but displaced sideways by z. The configuration space of the unicycle is its possible locations { y, z } and orientations { θ }, forming the Euclidean group SE(2). There are three primitive operations: roll forwards or backwards; turn; or drift sideways (perpendicular to the rolling direction). We model the difficulty of any parking manoeuvre withThe cost of parkingis the length ∫d s of the shortest path that connects our starting configuration { θ, y, z } = {0, 0, 0} to our parking spot {0, 0, z }.

### Invariance properties of bacterial random walks in complex structures [^031312fd]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The effect of size and shape

We have demonstrated that, for a fixed shape, the density of obstacles has a strong effect on the distribution of path lengths while leaving the mean value unchanged as long as the total internal accessible area remains the same.

We will now investigate the effects of shape and size on the path length distributions and again conclude that, although path distributions are very sensitive to the detailed geometry of the domain, mean path lengths and residence times can be accurately predicted using only the surface to perimeter ratio. We fabricate microstructures of circular, squared and triangular shapes all in four different sizes as shown in Fig. 2a. In all structures the obstacle density is fixed to N / S = 0.016 μm −2. All recorded trajectories are also plotted in Fig. 2a with a color map encoding the scaled path length L /. In Fig. 2b we plot for each structure the histogram of path lengths normalized by the expected valuein Eq. 4. As we move from circles to squares and then to triangles we observe that the corresponding histograms are characterized by larger frequencies for both short and long path lengths. The probability of short paths increases as we introduce convex corners and reduce their angle, as evidenced by the blue-violet color of the corners in squared and triangular structures. The presence of longer paths in triangles can be also understood noting that the normalized maximum straight paths for circles, square and triangles are respectively 4/ π,/ π and/ π (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Despite these qualitative and quantitative differences between histograms, mean path lengths are always close to 1 when normalized by the predicted valueas shown in Fig. 2b. The observed path length distributions can be very well reproduced by a Lorentz gas model where collisions with obstacles are described as instantaneous reorientation events. These events are assumed to occur with a constant probability per unit path length given by, where/ π is the rotational average cross section of line obstacles with length b (see Methods). For perfectly straight trajectories, circles and squares have path length distributions with a vertical asymptote. A strong peak is found at the location of this divergence and is progressively smeared as the linear size of the domain becomes larger than the mean free path. Upon increasing the size of the region a peak aroundappears due to bacteria that scatter close to the boundary, reorient and exit. The mix of these two types of trajectories gives rise to the observed double-peak structure. Differently for the triangle no asymptote is present in the P (L) for large λ, therefore only a peak atprogressively appears. These results show that P (L) depends strongly on the random walk properties (as the mean free path), and on the domain features (shape and size). Differently the mean valuesanddepend only on the surface to perimeter ratio of the domain as expressed by Eq. 4. Experimental values ofare shown Fig. 3a for all shapes and sizes. We find an excellent agreement with theory using the same value s = 6.3 μm 2 that was used previously to predict the experimental values ofas a function of the number of obstacles (see Fig. 1c). This value of s has also been used to calculateaccording to Eq. 5 which captures quantitatively well the experimental data as shown in Fig. 3b.

### Intact memory for irrelevant information impairs perception in amnesia [^626a92ed]. Neuron (2012). Low credibility.

Control Condition: Size

On each trial, two squares were presented. As with the objects, each square was positioned in one of two nonvisible frames separated by 8 pixels, and rotated by a random number between 15° and 165°. The size of each square was trial unique and subtended horizontal and vertical visual angles ranging from 1.45°–13.83°. The position of the squares in the frame was jittered slightly so that the edges of the squares did not line up across horizontal or vertical planes. For Difficult nonmatch trials, the length of each side of the square was randomly varied from 67 to 247 pixels. The difference between the lengths of the two squares varied between 9 and 15 pixels (similar to). By means of several pilot experiments, the difficulty of this condition was designed to closely match that of the High Ambiguity Object condition. For Easy nonmatch trials, the length of each side was randomly varied from 40 to 268 pixels, and the difference between the lengths of the two different sides varied between 16 and 40 pixels. Through several pilot experiments, the difficulty of this condition was designed to closely match that of the Low Ambiguity conditions of the Object stimuli. For match trials, the two rotated squares were identical in size.

Behavioral Procedure

After obtaining informed consent, each of the four conditions (High Ambiguity Objects, Low Ambiguity Objects, Difficult Size, Easy Size) was administered in a fully blocked design, with 72 consecutive trials per condition (36 match trials, 36 nonmatch trials). No feedback was given. Before each condition a short practice (with feedback) of 6 trial-unique stimuli (3 match, 3 nonmatch) was administered. The different conditions were presented in a pseudorandom order, with half the participants receiving the High Ambiguity Object condition prior to the Low Ambiguity Object condition and half the participants receiving the Difficult Size condition prior to the Easy Size condition. The experiment was self-paced, with a maximum of 15 s allowed for each trial. Eye movements were measured using a SR Research Ltd. Eyelink 1000 eye-tracking desktop monocular system and sampled at 1,000 Hz with a spatial resolution of approximately 0.01°.

### Do alterations in vertebral and disc dimensions affect an elliptical model of thoracic kyphosis? [^82ddcac7]. Spine (2003). Low credibility.

Study Design

Mathematical modeling, using least squares method, of thoracic kyphosis was constructed as digitized points from radiographs of 50 healthy patients.

Objective

To determine a simple geometric model of the thoracic kyphosis.

Summary Of Background Data

Thoracic kyphosis is an important parameter of health, but geometric models of kyphosis are rare. Few papers report vertebral body and disc height data.

Methods

Thoracic vertebral bodies were digitized on lateral radiographs of 50 healthy patients. The average path of the posterior vertebral body corners of T1 through T12 was modeled, in the least squares sense, with a portion of an ellipse. The best-fit ellipse was sectioned with different model partitions using four sets of vertebral body heights and disc heights. Segmental and global angles derived from these four models were compared with reported values in the literature.

Results

A 72 degrees portion of an ellipse, with a minor-to-major axis ratio of 0.69, can closely approximate the path of the posterior body corners from the inferior of T1 to the superior of T12. The posterior vertebral body heights and disc heights have an average ratio of approximately 5:1. Segmental angles from T3-T4 through T11-T12 for all four models are close to other reported values. The thoracic spine has a height-to-length ratio of approximately 0.96.

Conclusions

Thoracic kyphosis from inferior-posterior T1 to superior-posterior T12 can be closely modeled (least squares error per point < 1 mm) with a 72 degrees piece of an ellipse with a minor-to-major axis ratio of 0.69. The major axis is parallel to the posterior body margin of T12, whereas the minor axis passes through the superior endplate of T12. Segmental angles derived from this elliptical modeling are in the range of values from healthy patients.

### A fractal analysis of human cranial sutures [^f270cffc]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Many biological structures are products of repeated iteration functions. As such, they demonstrate characteristic, scale-invariant features. Fractal analysis of these features elucidates the mechanism of their formation. The objectives of this project were to determine whether human cranial sutures demonstrate self-similarity and measure their exponents of similarity (fractal dimensions).

Design

One hundred three documented human skulls from the Terry Collection of the Smithsonian Institution were used. Their sagittal sutures were digitized and the data converted to bitmap images for analysis using box-counting method of fractal software.

Results

The log-log plots of the number of boxes containing the sutural pattern, N(r), and the size of the boxes, r, were all linear, indicating that human sagittal sutures possess scale-invariant features and thus are fractals. The linear portion of these log-log plots has limits because of the finite resolution used for data acquisition. The mean box dimension, D(b), was 1.29289 ± 0.078457 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.27634 to 1.30944.

Conclusions

Human sagittal sutures are self-similar and have a fractal dimension of 1.29 by the box-counting method. The significance of these findings includes: sutural morphogenesis can be described as a repeated iteration function, and mathematical models can be constructed to produce self-similar curves with such D(b). This elucidates the mechanism of actual pattern formation. Whatever the mechanisms at the cellular and molecular levels, human sagittal suture follows the equation log N(r) = 1.29 log 1/r, where N(r) is the number of square boxes with sides r that are needed to contain the sutural pattern and r equals the length of the sides of the boxes.

### Magnetization transfer and frequency distribution effects in the SSFP ellipse [^f2747c42]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

3 METHODS

3.1 Model fitting

The following assumes multiple ellipses labeled i = 1… m acquired with phase increments j = 1… n. Each ellipse has a different α i or T RFi to change the MT weighting. Fitting proceeds in two steps. We first calculate the ellipse parameters for each ellipse separately, resulting in m values each of M Ei, a i and b i. In the second step, the MT parameters are found from the ellipse parameters.

PLANET calculates M E, a, and b algebraically for a single ellipse, but is difficult to use in the region near the Ernst angle because of a sign change in the formula for b. 7 At 3T and above, due to B 1 + inhomogeneity, it cannot be guaranteed that α will be above the Ernst angle in all voxels. Also, although numerous algebraic ellipse methods exist, they have been developed for the general case where no a priori information is available, 14, 15 but here the ellipse must be vertical (b < 2 a /(1 + a 2)) and must not contain the origin. 6 Hence in preference, we used a bounded nonlinear least‐squares fit of Equation 7 to find M E, a, and b for each ellipse, implemented in our freely available toolbox. 16 The cost function waswhere s j is the acquired complex‐valued SSFP data for ϕ j and m j is the corresponding value calculated from Equation 7. The bounds were 0 < a < exp (− TR /5000), 0 < b < 1, −2 π < ψ < 2 π, and −2 π < ϕ RF < 2 π, and we forced the ellipse to remain vertical. The initial guess for M E was |∑ s j / n |, while a and b were calculated assuming T 1 f / T 2 f = 1000/50 ms for the specified TR and α. The initial guesses for the tightly coupled ψ and ϕ RF were more complex. Three guesses for ψ (− π, 0, + π) were tried, and for each ϕ RF was set to the phase of the complex mean of the data minus the guess for ψ. The guess with the lowest root‐mean‐square residual to the data was used as the initial guess for the full nonlinear least squares algorithm. A Huber Loss function was applied to the residuals to suppress the influence of outliers. 17

### Three-dimensional computed tomography analysis of spinal canal length increase after surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: a multicenter study [^58700c3b]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2019). Medium credibility.

3D-CT-Based Measurement of Spinal Canal Length

All patients underwent CT imaging no more than 1 month before surgery and within 1 month (inpatient) after surgery. To calculate the spinal canal distance from T2 to L2, we used 3D-CT imaging software (ZedView; LEXI). The center of the spinal canal was determined as follows. First, the center point of both pedicles of each vertebra was identified, as the point of intersection between the major axis and minor axis of the circle or ellipse, in the coronal plane (Fig. 1 -A, left). Next, the axial plane was defined as a plane passing through the centers of the 2 pedicles of the vertebra and parallel to the surface of the cranial end plate (Fig. 1 -A, middle). The center of the spinal canal in the axial plane was determined by the intersection of 2 lines: one bisecting the angle formed by lines drawn on the ventral side of each lamina, and the other representing the major axis of the circle or ellipse approximating the spinal canal (Fig. 1 -A, right). The distances between each consecutive center of the spinal canal were added from T2 to L2 (Fig. 1 -B). The delta T2-L2 length (postoperative minus preoperative) was calculated for each patient (Fig. 1 -C). We examined the correlation between the delta T2-L2 length and each of the abovementioned preoperative and postoperative measurements, such as the main thoracic curve. We also examined how much each spinal subsegment contributed to the change in spinal canal length.

### MEMS-tunable dielectric metasurface lens [^530a1458]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The metasurfaces are based on high-contrast dielectric transmitarrays. These devices consist of arrays of high index dielectric scatterers (nano-posts) with different shapes and sizes. With proper design, the nano-posts enable complete control of phase and polarization on a subwavelength scale. When only phase control is required, the nano-posts should have a symmetric cross-section (i.e. square, circular, etc.). For fabrication considerations, we choose nano-posts with square-shaped cross-section on a square lattice. Since both the moving and stationary metasurface lenses have high numerical apertures (NA ~0.8), we used a recently developed technique for choosing the metasurface parameters (i.e. amorphous silicon layer thickness, lattice constant, and minimum and maximum post side lengths) to maximize the efficiency of high NA lenses for both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations. The method is based on approximating the efficiency of a lens designed with certain metasurface parameters through efficiencies of periodic gratings designed with the same parameters. Using this method and considering the design wavelength of 915 nm, the α -Si layer thicknesses were chosen to be 530 and 615 nm for the moving and stationary lenses, respectively. The lattice constant was set to 320 nm in both cases. Figure 1d, e show simulated transmission amplitudes and phases for uniform arrays of nano-posts on the membrane and the glass substrate, respectively. Given a required phase profile, one can find the best nano-post for each site on the metasurface using Fig. 1d, e.

### The dynamics of pattern matching in camouflaging cuttlefish [^6cbbddc2]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Texture representation

The texture representation used in our low-resolution imaging (Figs. 1–3) was the max-pooled fifth layer activations (conv5_1) of the VGG-19 neural network with weights pretrained with the ImageNet dataset in an object-recognition task, accessed through the Keras platform. The choice of layer and model was informed by findings from psychophysics experiments on visual textures synthesized using Gram matrices of different layers of the model, and more broadly by the visual texture literature. To our knowledge, this method has not been previously used to study cuttlefish camouflage.

The inputs to the neural network were preprocessed as follows: cuttlefish images were converted into 8-bit greyscale and histogram-equalized using OpenCV 4. The background, as detected in the segmentation step, was replaced by middle grey. The images were cropped and/or padded into a square such that the cuttlefish body length was half of the image length. The cuttlefish body length was estimated for each video by taking the mean lengths of the fitted ellipses from 5–10 randomly selected frames. Finally, the images were downscaled to 224 × 224 px, and zero-centred using the VGG-19/ImageNet-compliant input preprocessing function in Keras.

### Comparing accuracies of length-type geographic atrophy growth rate metrics using atrophy-front growth modeling [^fbef3263]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare the accuracies of the previously proposed square-root-transformed and perimeter-adjusted metrics for estimating length-type geographic atrophy (GA) growth rates.

Design

Cross-sectional and simulation-based study.

Participants

Thirty-eight eyes with GA from 27 patients.

Methods

We used a previously developed atrophy-front growth model to provide analytical and numerical evaluations of the square-root-transformed and perimeter-adjusted growth rate metrics on simulated and semisimulated GA growth data.

Main Outcome Measures

Comparison of the accuracies of the square-root-transformed and perimeter-adjusted metrics on simulated and semisimulated GA growth data.

Results

Analytical and numerical evaluations showed that the accuracy of the perimeter-adjusted metric is affected minimally by baseline lesion area, focality, and circularity over a wide range of GA growth rates. Average absolute errors of the perimeter-adjusted metric were approximately 20 times lower than those of the square-root-transformed metrics, per evaluation on a semisimulated dataset with growth rate characteristics matching clinically observed data.

Conclusions

Length-type growth rates have an intuitive, biophysical interpretation that is independent of lesion geometry, which supports their use in clinical trials of GA therapeutics. Taken in the context of prior studies, our analyses suggest that length-type GA growth rates should be measured using the perimeter-adjusted metric, rather than square-root-transformed metrics.

### Comparison of two side-port incisions in phacoemulsification [^a67078ea]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this project is to compare the accuracy, safety, and consistency of near-square and asymmetric trapezoid side-port incisions in cataract surgery.

Setting

Aier Eye Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan Hubei Province, China.

Design

Prospective pilot study.

Methods

The patients were divided into Groups A and B using the random number table method. Group A received a near-square side-port incision (SPI) with a 22G needle, and Group B received an asymmetric trapezoid SPI with a 15-degree blade. We contrasted the differences in incision length, width, and shape; surgical time; and postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) between the two groups.

Results

Eighty eyes from 80 patients were included. The mean external width of incision in Group A was much smaller than that in Group B (p < .01), while the internal width in Group A was significantly larger (p < .01). In Group A, there is no statistically significant difference between the external and internal incision diameters (p = .081). In Group B, the external diameter is obviously larger than the internal diameter (p < .01). The incision diameter consistency in Group A was higher than that in Group B. There was no statistically significant difference in incision length between the two groups (p = 0.67). One day after surgery, there were no significant differences in incision morphology (p = 1.0; .723) or operating time between the two groups (p = .89). There was no obvious incision leakage in either group after surgery (p = .337).

Conclusions

The present study suggests that a near-square side-port with a 22G needle is smaller and results in better incision consistency. Moreover, the 22G needle is inexpensive and can be easily obtained.

Tissue substrates are constructed by arranging a specified number of parallel cylinders in a region with periodic boundaries. Cylinders have radii drawn from a gamma distribution with specified shape and scale parameters (k and θ, respectively). Cylinders that intersect the boundaries on the simulated region are copied on the opposite side of the substrate to ensure periodicity 23.

Once all cylinders have been placed on the substrate, each cylinder then has an internal structure added. Internal cylinders are parallel to the outer cylinder, and have radii drawn from a gamma distribution with the same shape parameter as the outer cylinder distribution, but scale parameter multiplied by the area fraction of the outer cylinder on the substrate.

Internal cylinders are also nonintersecting. Each cylinder has circular cross section and is infinitely long; therefore, we only need to pick a trial location in the cross‐sectional disk. Uniform sampling is achieved by picking coordinates using a relation that preserves the volume element of the unit disk:whereis the radial coordinate on the disk. Cartesian coordinates uniformly distributed on the disk are obtained using

Note that this transformation is required for uniform sampling density on the disk 25. Trial coordinates on the unit disk are generated by samplinguniformly inanduniformly in. The coordinates are then scaled and translated from the unit disk at the origin to the cylinder of radiusat positionwhereis the radius of the cylinder being placed.

Intersection checking is performed using the hierarchical method outlined previously. Once a position for the new cylinder is found that does not intersect with any others, it is added to the local map and the process repeats. The complete map is reused during dynamics simulation (Fig. 1 d).

Diffusion Dynamics and Intersection Checking

Diffusing spins execute random walks in three dimensions (3D). Each step in a spin's trajectory must be checked for intersection with the tissue substrate. As with the tissue substrate construction phase, the efficiency of this check has a significant effect on the simulation performance.

For each step in a spin's trajectory, a set of intersecting cells is generated using Breshenham's algorithm 24, 26. The step is tested against objects that intersect these grid elements. For internal intersection checks, the step is projected into the local map, and parametric clipping 24, 27 is employed to exclude portions of the step that fall outside it.

Tissue Models

This section describes tissue models designed to investigate microstructural change as well as a baseline model of healthy muscle tissue.

### Evaluating the safety and operability of asymmetric trapezoid and near-square side-port incision in cataract surgery [^5a379394]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare the accuracy, safety, and consistency of asymmetric trapezoid and near-square side-port incision in cataract surgery.

Setting

Aier Eye Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

Design

Prospective pilot study.

Methods

This study included patients who underwent phacoemulsification between January 2022 and August 2022. They were divided into Group A and Group B using the random number table method. Group A was given a near-square side-port incision and Group B was given an asymmetric trapezoid side-port incision. We contrasted the differences in incision length, width, and shape; surgical time; and postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) between the 2 groups.

Results

220 eyes of 220 patients were included. The mean external width of the incision in Group A was much smaller than that in Group B (P < .01), and the consistency of the incision diameter in Group A was better than that in Group B. There was no statistically significant difference in incision length between the 2 groups (P = 0.75). 1 day after surgery, there was no statistically significant difference in incision morphology between the 2 groups (P = 0.72). The operating time for Group A was significantly shorter than that of Group B (P < .01). There was no obvious incision leakage in both groups after surgery, and the IOP was generally elevated after surgery, but there was no significant statistical difference between the 2 groups (P = 0.98).

Conclusions

The present study suggests that a near-square side-port results in better consistency of incision width and shorter surgical time.

### Bilayer-folded lamellar mesophase induced by random polymer sequence [^786f973c]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

a – c Micellar lamellar spacing d m and folded lamellar spacing d f as a function of w p. a: i DA = 60%; b: 55%; c: 50%. Squares, circles, triangles, and diamonds represent samples with different N, in increasing order. d d m and d f as a function of N at w p = 64%. Contour length is shown as a dashed line. Squares, circles, and triangles denote i DA of 60%, 55%, and 50%, respectively.

The amphiphilic random copolymer may be considered a semiflexible chain stiffened by the side chains. Steric congestion between neighboring side chains grafted per every repeating unit elongates the backbone as observed in bottlebrush polymers. This may be related to the preference of the lamellar packing over the hexagonal cylindrical arrangement with increasing N. With increasing N further, however, entropic loss caused by chain stretching predicts that the backbone should be folded above the critical length to relieve the penalty. Such hairpin folding has been observed in main chain liquid crystalline polyesters. This picture is consistent with the fully elongated conformation of shorter polymers with lower N, which generally develop ordered mesophases at lower concentration but do not show the L f phase. We find the average number of hairpins per chain is in the range of 1–4 at i DA = 55 and 60%, which is also comparable to the literature. We also note that the amphiphilic random copolymer with the stiffer polymethacrylate backbone did not produce the L f phase, despite forming the multilamellar L α phase (Supplementary Fig. 49).

### Curving the space by non-hermiticity [^f0048a14]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Geometric interpretations of non-Hermitian phenomena

Our duality provides a natural explanation of several peculiar non-Hermitian phenomena. Firstly, the orthonormal condition of effective theories in Eq. (2) and Eq. (6) readswhere the normalization constantcan be chosen freely. As a common feature of curved spaces, a finite curvature appears in the above equation. Considering a strip in the domain x 0 ≤ x ≤ x 0 + L, its width in the x -direction depends on y. Thus, a wave packet traveling in the y -direction must include an extra factorto guarantee the conservation of particle numbers. In the s -coordinate, Eq. (7) is written as. Discretizing this equation with, and transforming it to the HN model, we obtain, where ∣ γ ∣ −2 n is precisely the difference between the left and right eigenvectors, or the metric operator. The mapping to a curved space thus establishes an explicit physical interpretation of orthonormal conditions in non-Hermitian systems.

Secondly, the duality allows us to equate the non-Hermitian skin effect to its counterpart on the Poincaré half-plane we found recently. This can be best visualized using the embedding of a hyperbolic surface in three-dimensional (3D) Euclidean space. We define, x = r 0 φ, where r 0 is an arbitrary constant and η > 0, φ ∈ (− π, π). The embedding can then be written as

This is a parameterization of a pseudosphere with a constant negative curvature and a radius of, which satisfies. As shown in Fig. 1 b, a pseudosphere features a funnel shape, since the circumference of the circle with a fixed y (η) changes with changing y (η). As previously explained, a coordinate transformation y = y 0 e 2 q s maps eigenstates on the hyperbolic surface, to, which exponentially localizes near the funneling mouth, the smaller end.

### American Thyroid Association guide to investigating thyroid hormone economy and action in rodent and cell models [^dde23543]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Mouse thyroid high-frequency ultrasonography (HFUS) — technical parameters, anesthesia, and quantification — uses a Vevo 770 system with a single element probe of center frequency of 40 MHz; the transducer has an active face of 3 mm with lateral resolution 68.2 μm and axial resolution 38.5 μm, focal length 6 mm, mechanical index 0.14, and dynamic range 52 dB, with an alternative 30 MHz probe (focal depth 12.7 mm; lateral 115 μm; axial 55 μm). HFUS is performed under general anesthesia using 1.5%-2% isoflurane, real-time imaging can be performed at a frame rate of 20 Hz (temporal resolution 50 milliseconds), and studies can be completed in about 20 minutes. Thyroid lobe volume is calculated by the oval formula (width x depth x length x π/6); adult C57BL/6 thyroid volume ranges between 2.81 and 4.9 μL, increases to volumes that range between 4.1 and 8.8 μL with diffuse goiter, and the smallest detectable nodule diameter is 0.46 mm; features suggestive of malignancy include hypoechogenicity, poorly defined margins, internal microcalcification, irregular shapes, and extraglandular extension.

### Theory of branching morphogenesis by local interactions and global guidance [^34973bae]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Comparison between analytical model and simulations

Importantly, Eq. (1) describing the probability of branch orientation attains a steady-state solution (∂ t P st (ψ, t) = 0) that is largely independent of the form of the external field, i.e. it applies generically to different geometries after defining the relative branch alignment with respect to the external field. This solution predicts that the alignment of angles with respect to the polarity of the external field will be determined by the von Mises distribution (circular normal distribution):with a concentration parameter given by ν ≡ μ f c / D, and I 0 (ν) is the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order zero. The fluctuations in the angular alignment as determined by the variance will thus follow a universal scaling approximately given by σ 2 ∝ D / μ f c that underlines the relative contribution of the local noise to the external guidance. For an axial (linear) field parallel to the horizontal axis, for instance, the above solution applies to the distribution of the local angles φ of the branch segments (Fig. 1 d). In a radial external field emerging from a central point of origin, however, the alignment of a branch is determined by the angle difference ψ ≡ φ − θ between its local angle φ and its angle θ with respect to the origin of the external field, and thus ψ, rather than φ, is predicted to follow the von Mises distribution (see Supplementary Figs. 4–9 for the alignment angles for different model assumptions). Comparing these analytical criteria with the numerical simulations led to excellent agreement without using any fit parameter (Fig. 1 d–f).

To summarize, the combination of analytical modelling and numerical simulations allows us to make a number of predictions for different topological and geometrical properties of branched structures: A key signature of external guidance is that branching angles should conform to a von Mises distribution while the overall branching structure in an axial field can adopt a well-defined conical domain in the absence of defined boundaries. Furthermore, a signature of the stochastic nature of branching and annihilating random walks is that even with external guidance, the local branch length or overall network size and shape should be highly variable to random branching events and local density-driven termination of tip growth.

### Chirality transmission in macromolecular domains [^855d1ff4]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Change-in-contour-length (Δ L)

During the unfolding of coiled-coil peptide, the expected Δ L was calculated by the general Eq. (1), where L is the contour length of the (T) 90 fragment which can be determined as, L = L nt × 90 nt = ~40.5 nm, here L nt is the contour length of a single nucleotide, 0.40–0.45 nm/nt –, and x is the end-to-end distance, which is the sum of the diameter of dsDNA (~2 nm) and length of the flanking (T) 2 at each side of the (T) 90 fragment (0.9 × 2 nm = 1.8 nm), i.e. 2 nm + 1.8 nm = 3.8 nm.

Therefore, the expected change-in-contour-length for a coiled-coil peptide complex is ~40.5–3.8 = ~36.7 nm.

Data analysis

At a force (F), the change in extension (Δ x) was calculated by the extension difference between the stretching and the relaxing traces at that force. Then, by using wormlike-chain (WLC) model (Eq. (2)), the resulting Δ x value at this force was converted to the change-in-contour-length (Δ L) as follows, where k B is the Boltzmann constant, T is absolute temperature, P is the persistent length of dsDNA (50.8 nm), and S is the stretching modulus (1243 pN).

Echocardiographic assessment of right atrial (RA) size — volume by 2D describes that "2D volumetric measurements are usually based on tracings of the blood-tissue interface on the apical four-chamber view" and that "At the tricuspid valve level, the contour is closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the tricuspid ring with a straight line". It adds, "Volumes can be computed by using either the single plane area-length" or "the disks summation technique", performed in a "2D view". The listed advantage is "More representative of actual RA size than linear dimensions", while limitations include "Assumes a symmetrical shape of the cavity", "Single plane volume calculation may be inaccurate since it assumes that RA enlargement is symmetrical", and "Normal values not well established".

### Resolution limit of cylinder diameter estimation by diffusion MRI: the impact of gradient waveform and orientation dispersion [^b210ee4d]. NMR in Biomedicine (2017). Low credibility.

2.2.3 Resolution limit for parallel axons and general waveforms

A key result of the present analysis concerns the implications of the low‐frequency approximation for the resolution limit. Following Equations 7, 16, and 20, we obtainAn important feature of this relation is that it separates the effects of the geometry (d 4) from the diffusion encoding (the integral part). By utilising Parseval's identity and Equation 22, we can simplify the integral further:We use this result to define an important entity:wheresinceWe refer to the entity V ω as the 'spectral encoding variance', since it is defined from the second moment of q (ω). The unit of V ω is 1/s 2.

The product b V ω captures all features of the gradient waveforms required to predict the signal attenuation perpendicular to the cylinder. The b ‐value captures the attenuation and V ω the time‐dependence, since we can approximate D ⊥ for an arbitrary gradient waveform byThe signal attenuation is thus approximated byThe expression above can be shown to be equivalent to Equation (119) of Grebenkov, 59 which was derived for diffusion in the motional narrowing regime. Previous work on the motional narrowing regime in the context of spin relaxation has found similar equations relating the square of the gradient field, the compartment size to fourth order, and the inverse of the bulk diffusion coefficient. 60, 61 In that context, motional narrowing occurs when spins diffuse rapidly through an inhomogeneous field. In our context, the motional narrowing regime occurs when the gradient varies slowly compared with the time it takes to traverse the confinement. Formally, this can be expressed as the case where the gradient waveform contains no energy above f 0. At this cut‐off frequency, the root‐mean‐square displacement due to diffusion is of the order of the compartment size. This approach to the motional narrowing regime is an extension to that described by Hurlimann et al. 62 who analysed three different temporal regimes of the constant gradient experiment.

Left atrial (LA) volume — Two-dimensional LA images should be independently obtained and optimized; maximum volume at end-systole is identified, A4C and A2C endocardial borders are traced excluding atrial appendage and pulmonary veins, LA length is measured in both views from the center of the mitral annulus to the inner edge of the furthest traced superior wall, the long-axis lengths should be within 5 mm of each other (otherwise the apical images should be reevaluated), and most systems calculate biplane volume using area-length and biplane disk summation where the shorter length is used for area-length and the longer length for method of disks, which is the preferred method, with laboratories advised to consistently use the same technique.

### Average focal length and power of a section of any defined surface [^fe6528c5]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide a method to allow calculation of the average focal length and power of a lens through a specified meridian of any defined surface, not limited to the paraxial approximations.

Setting

University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.

Method

Functions were derived to model back-vertex focal length and representative power through a meridian containing any defined surface. Average back-vertex focal length was based on the definition of the average of a function, using the angle of incidence as an independent variable.

Results

Univariate functions allowed determination of average focal length and power through a section of any defined or topographically measured surface of a known refractive index. These functions incorporated aberrations confined to the section.

Conclusions

The proposed method closely approximates the average focal length, and by inference power, of a section (meridian) of a surface to a single or scalar value. It is not dependent on the paraxial and other nonconstant approximations and includes aberrations confined to that meridian. A generalization of this method to include all orthogonal and oblique meridians is needed before a comparison with measured wavefront values can be made.

### Helical reconstruction of VP39 reveals principles for baculovirus nucleocapsid assembly [^81f9b665]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Supervised classification of helical segments

In order to determine the helical symmetry and extent of potential tube flattening upon sample vitrification for all our extracted segments, we prepared a set of 3D references with defined helical geometry and flattening for supervised classification. We note that caution should be taken when applying this supervised classification approach, as it may generate incorrect symmetry assignments along with assignments that are correct. The results of our supervised classification require careful analysis.

We first calculated the unit cell vectors a = [27.91 Å, −43.86 Å] and b = [72.31 Å, 43.86 Å] of the underlying 2D crystal lattice that described the [n 1 = 14, n 2 = 14]-symmetry of our 4.1 Å-resolution reconstruction. Different helical symmetries, where the local packing of VP39 protomers is invariant (or almost invariant) by obeying the same 2D crystal lattice and where the resulting tubes do not contain a seam, can be defined by a wrapping vector w = n 1 a + n 2 b. The wrapping vector defines how the 2D crystal lattice is wrapped into a tube. It lies in the equator of the helix and its length corresponds to the circumference of the helix (Fig. 5A). Thus, with a and b defined, we calculated the helical parameters x 1, y 1, x 2, y 2 for any chosen lattice point [n 1, n 2] by vector analysis and trigonometry using NumPy(Fig. 5B, C). x 1 and x 2 are the arc lengths with corresponding helical twist 1 and twist 2, respectively. y 1 and y 2 are the helical rise 1 and rise 2, respectively. If n 1 and n 2 are integer times of each other, the helical packing results in rotational symmetry (x 1 = x 2 and y 1 = y 2), e.g. C14 for the [n 1 = 14, n 2 = 14]-symmetry (Fig. 5B). If n 1 and n 2 are different, there is no rotational symmetry (Fig. 5C).

### Is the middle between both halves? midpoint location and segment size estimation in neglect [^b7e5475a]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Line bisection errors in neglect are attributed to perceptual size distortions. In order to compare the two segments of the line to determine if they are equal, one might first estimate the location of a midpoint that defines the two line segments to be compared.

Objectives

The authors attempted to determine whether estimating a line's midpoint can be dissociated from comparing the two segments of this line, and if so, what the relative contribution of each of these tasks is to the perceptual bias in neglect.

Methods

The authors studied two patients with hemispatial neglect from right hemisphere lesions by asking them where bisection marks were placed on prebisected lines and whether the two adjacent line segments were equal.

Results

There was a stronger bias judging the position of the bisecting marks ("where" determination) than comparing the size of two adjacent line segments.

Conclusions

These results suggest that perceptual size distortion of line segments alone cannot explain the subjects' line bisection bias, but postperceptual deficits in "where" computations may better account for their errors locating the midpoint. "Where" determinations might require more attentional capacity, depend more heavily on viewer-centered allocation of attention, and be mediated by the right hemisphere's "where" dorsal stream. In contrast, comparing the length of two segments might be mediated by the left hemisphere's "what" ventral stream.

### When predictive mechanisms go wrong: disordered visual synchrony thresholds in schizophrenia [^647cd478]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with schizophrenia display an impaired sense of temporal continuity, and we showed that they judge events as being simultaneous even in case of large onset asynchronies. We check here whether this means a fusion of events in time, or on the contrary, a segregation of events and a deficit in coding time-event structure. Subjects decided whether 2 squares were displayed simultaneously or asynchronously on the screen and gave their response by hitting a left or right response key. The implicit processing of asynchrony was explored by means of the Simon effect, which refers to the finding that manual responses are biased to the side of the stimulus. We checked whether responses were biased to the side of the first or second square, when squares were asynchronous and displayed on opposite sides. Results revealed an enlarged time window in patients irrespective of the squares' position (intra- vs interhemispheric presentation). But for asynchronies eliciting "synchronous" judgments, patients' responses were biased to the side of the first square. In contrast, controls were biased in all cases to the side of the second square. The inverse effects observed below thresholds in patients and controls cannot be attributed to a generalized deficit. In controls, elementary predictive mechanisms would allow anticipation of upcoming events, whereas patients appear to process squares as if isolated rather than following each other. Predictive mechanisms would be impaired in patients, who would rather rely on reactive mechanisms in order to perceive asynchrony.

Kinetic analysis

The particle size distributions of LDH synthesized at 4.1 × 10 4 s −1 (A), 8.4 × 10 5 s −1 (B) and 3.2 × 10 6 s −1 (C) were measured to determine the effect of shear on nucleation and growth kinetics. The particle areas and calculated hexagonal side length a are compiled in Fig. 6a. From A to B, the median particle area decreases from 43.4 to 39.0 nm 2 and the side length distribution narrows from 3.92 ± 1.03 to 3.89 ± 0.94 nm. From B to C, the area distribution becomes multimodal and the side length distribution widens to 3.75 ± 0.97 nm. By deconvoluting the area distribution of C, we find five peaks regularly separated by 11.7 nm 2, approximately the area of the smallest particle measured (10.6 nm 2). This particle, as seen in Fig. 6b, possesses a side length of 2.14 nm and is composed of only 113 cations.

### Configuration and localization of the nipple-areola complex in men [^521b68cc]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

The causes of bilateral absence of the nipple-areola complex in men are seldom congenital, but attributable rather to destruction as a result of trauma, or after mastectomy in female-to-male transsexuals and in male breast cancer, or after the correction of extreme bilateral gynecomastia. Such a bilateral loss becomes a major reconstructive challenge with respect to the configuration and localization of a new nipple-areola complex. Because there is very little information available in the literature, we carried out a cross-sectional study on the configuration and localization of the nipple-areola complex in men. A total of 100 healthy men aged 20 to 36 years were examined under standardized conditions. The first part of the study dealt with the configuration of the nipple-areola complex (dimensions, round or oval shape). The second part concentrated on the localization of the complex on the thoracic wall with respect to anatomic landmarks and in correlation to various parameters such as weight and height of the body, circumference of the thorax, length of sternum, and position in the intercostal space. Of the 100 subjects examined, 91 had oval and seven had a round nipple-areola complex. An asymmetry between the right and the left side was found in two cases. The mean ratio of the horizontal/vertical diameter of an oval nipple-areola complex was 27:20 mm and the mean diameter for a round nipple-areola complex was 23 mm. The center of the nipple-areola complex was in the fourth intercostal space in 75 percent and in the fifth intercostal space in 23 percent of the subjects. To localize the nipple-areola complex on the thoracic wall de novo, at least two reproducible measurements proved to be necessary, composed of a horizontal line (distance from the midsternal line to the nipple = A) and a vertical line (distance from the sternal notch to the intersection of line A, = B). The closest correlation for the horizontal distance A was given by the circumference of the thorax: A = 2.4 cm + [0.09 x circumference of thorax (cm)], (r = 0.68). The best correlation to calculate the vertical distance B was found using the distance A and the length of the sternum: B = 1.2 cm + [0.28 x length of sternum (cm)] + [0.1 x circumference of thorax (cm)], (R = 0.50). In cases of bilateral absence, we recommend creating an oval nipple-areola complex in men. The appropriate localization can be calculated by means of two simple equations derived from the circumference of the thorax and the length of the sternum.

### Anterior segment optical coherence tomography evaluation of the integrity of clear corneal incisions: a comparison between 2.2-mm and 2.65-mm main incisions [^b91f7cd4]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare wound characteristics and integrity of the 2.2-mm and 2.65-mm clear corneal incisions.

Design

Prospective, randomized clinical trial.

Methods

Patients undergoing phacoemulsification with lens implant were randomized to receive a 2.2-mm or 2.65-mm temporal clear corneal incision. The incisions were evaluated at 2, 24, and 96 hours for gape and wound architecture using anterior segment optical coherence tomography and for integrity using the Seidel test. Squareness of an incision was calculated (ratio of the incision length to the width).

Results

There were 30 patients in each group. Both incision sizes were watertight, although a mild internal main wound gape was detected on anterior segment optical coherence tomography in 35 eyes (58.3%) at 2 hours. The smaller wound was more square (0.81; standard deviation [SD], 0.11) than the larger wound (0.62; SD, 0.08; P < .001, t test). The mean squareness of eyes without wound gape at 2 hours (0.66; SD, 0.11) was lower than those with a wound gape (0.75; SD, 0.14; P = 0.008). A squareness factor of 0.72 or more had a positive predictive value for presence of wound gape at 2 hours of 79.3% and a negative predictive value of 61.3%. One side port incision with squareness of 1.39 had a mild leak at 2 and 24 hours, but no gape was seen on anterior segment optical coherence tomography.

Conclusions

Both the 2.2-mm and 2.65-mm clear corneal incisions clinically were competent, but the side port incision may leak. A truly square wound has a greater likelihood of being associated with internal wound gape at 2 hours after surgery, especially if the squareness factor is 0.72 or more.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^6a46fa06]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) volumes — Volume measurements are "usually based on tracings of the blood-tissue interface in the apical four- and two-chamber views", with the contour at the mitral valve level "closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the mitral ring with a straight line", and LV length "defined as the distance between the middle of this line and the most distant point of the LV contour". Techniques include biplane disk summation and area-length; biplane disk summation advantages are "Corrects for shape distortions" and "Less geometrical assumptions compared with linear dimensions", with limitations "Apex frequently foreshortened", "Endocardial dropout", and "Blind to shape distortions not visualized in the apical two- and four-chamber planes". For area-length, the advantage is "Partial correction for shape distortion", with limitations "Apex frequently foreshortened", "Heavily based on geometrical assumptions", and "Limited published data on normal population".

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^194fdbe5]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left atrial (LA) volume quantification by echocardiography is described using two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) and three-dimensional (3D) approaches, with 2D volumetric measurements based on tracings from apical four- and two-chamber views; at the mitral valve level the contour is closed by a straight line, endocardial tracing excludes the atrial appendage and pulmonary veins, LA length L is the shortest long axis from apical two- and four-chamber views, and the two lengths should not differ more than 5 mm; volumes can be computed by an area-length approximation or by a disk summation technique, and 3D data sets are usually acquired from the apical approach using a multibeat full-volume acquisition. For the 2DE area-length technique, advantages include accurate assessment of asymmetric remodeling of the left atrium and being a more robust predictor of cardiovascular events than linear or area measurements, whereas limitations include geometric assumptions about LA shape, few accumulated data on normal population, and that single plane volume calculations are inaccurate because they assume A1 = A2. For 3D data sets, advantages are no geometrical assumption about LA shape and greater accuracy compared with 2D measurements, while limitations include dependence on adequate image quality, lower temporal resolution, limited data on normal values, and that patient's cooperation is required.

Gadolinium sensitivity experiments

Seeds were surface-sterilized with chlorine gas, sown on square plates (in a single row in the upper part of the plates), and stratified for 2 days in the dark at 4 °C. After stratification, seeds were germinated in a growth chamber under a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle at 21 °C, with plates kept in a vertical position. Plates containing 1/5 strength (0.86 gr/L) MS medium (Duchefa) pH = 5.7, 1% sucrose and 0.8% phytoagar, were supplemented with gadolinium (III) chloride hexahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich). Primary root length was scored after 5 or 6 days of growth with ImageJ software. Different genotypes were sown side by side on the same plate and in multiple combinations to buffer possible positional effects.

### Numerical simulation of double-wave vector experiments investigating diffusion in randomly oriented ellipsoidal pores [^3b8419dd]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Double-wave vector diffusion weighting is expected to represent a possibility to acquire information on cell size and shape. In numerical simulations, a theoretical description of the double wave vector-weighted signal is tested in a situation where the approximating assumptions (infinitely short gradient pulses, infinitely long diffusion time, infinitely long or zero delay between diffusion weightings, small gradient moment) are not strictly met. It is shown how the dependence of the signal on the angle between the diffusion gradient directions changes upon varying the delay between the second and the third gradient pulse, and how the measures of pore geometry derived from signal differences between two angles depend on the duration, temporal separation, and amplitude of the gradient pulses. The results indicate that a violation of the approximation conditions due to finite gradient pulse duration and separation generally leads to an underestimation of pore size and pore eccentricity. It is also concluded from the simulations that for pore sizes on the order of 10 microm the investigated effects are in a range that is observable even with whole-body gradient systems.

### Theory of branching morphogenesis by local interactions and global guidance [^9246d0a7]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Such extrinsic guidance provides a simple theoretical mechanism to restrict neuronal growth to a domain characterized by a well-defined opening angle. Turning to experiments, we found that reconstructed neurons were typically also characterized by such angle, which we estimated as. Theoretically, the average opening anglesdecreased monotonically with increasing field strength f c (see Fig. 4 a for an illustration) with strikingly similar values both in the presence and absence of self-repulsion (see Fig. 4 b). Using a simple geometric argument -assuming in particular that this opening angle is determined by the changes in the angle to origin θ values of the active tips at the boundary of the branching network, we could approximate this angle by:whereis the radial distance of the furthermost branch from the origin of the network (fixed by the maximal time of network growth). With this approximation, we could fit the numerical data by using a single fit parameter χ (see Supplementary Note 2 for further details). From the fitted value of the external field f c = 0.6, we predict an opening angle of(mean ± SD). Although this overestimates the experimental value, we note that this prediction is based on a perfectly radial gradient in 360 ∘ without boundary, i.e. assuming neurons can branch backwards. When we confined the theory to a 180 ∘ hemispherical region, which seems to reflect the experimental geometries (Supplementary Fig. 11), we obtained average opening angles of, much closer to the data.

The strength of extrinsic guidance determines the territory of the branched structures in simulations, with minimal influence from local self-avoidance.

The monotonic decrease ofobtained from simulations is well-described by the analytical approximation(solid line), see Eq. (3), with the fit parameter χ = π /15.

### Isolation by distance in populations with power-law dispersal [^83fc32b9]. G3 (2023). Medium credibility.

To simulate steeper tails with α > 2, we again use a degenerate F-distribution, drawing Δ X t from the two-sided distribution:

Atlong times, the bulk of the displacement distribution approaches that of a diffusive kernel, with dispersal constant D equal to half the mean squared single-generation displacement of one lineage:

Foreach simulated trajectory { x t }, we then compute the path-specific distribution of coalescence times p ({ x t ′ ≤ t }) and path-specific mean homozygosity ψ ({ x t ′ ≤ ∞ }):

R (x) in (20) is a rectangular function representing a uniform rate of coalescence of all lineages within a distance δ:

Forevery time-step, the lineages spend in this region, there is a probability of coalescence 1 − exp [− 1/(2 ρδ)]. We discuss issues with the microscopic interpretation of this model after we introduce our analytical model below.

Unconditioned values p (t | x) and ψ (x) are again obtained by averaging across all simulated trajectories. Error bars in plots show 68% confidence intervals, as determined by the percentile bootstrap with 10 4 bootstrap samples.

We set δ = 0.5 for all simulations in one dimension. For the simulations of mean homozygosity ψ shown in Fig. 5, we simulate 250,000 independent runs of 1,000 generations each for each combination of present-day separation x and tail parameter α. We set the dispersal constant D α indirectly by setting the characteristic spread c of two lineages after one generation (t = 1), c = (2 D α) 1/ α, to be fixed at c = 250 for α < 2, and c = 179.68 for α = 2.05. For the largest present-day separations, x = e 10 and e 11, coalescence within 1,000 generations is very rare, so we increase the number of runs to 1.25 × 10 6. For Figs. 6 and 8, we choose D α such that c = 0.2, and simulate 10,000 independent runs of length 1,000 generations each.

Consequently, the 2D-edge and vertex detection, as shown in Fig. 4e, g, can be performed by further processing of the obtained orthogonal 1D-edge information. Firstly, based on the linearity of Fourier transform, the edge information on the x - and y -axes can be registered simultaneously by superimposing their corresponding transfer functions in spatial Fourier domain. Hence, 2D-edge detectioncan be achieved by the superposition operation on electric field profiles of Huygens' metasurface along orthogonal axes, as:

Secondly, by extracting the common parts of x - and y -directions edge data that coexist at the same positions, vertex detectioncan be implemented through the multiplication on 1D-edge detection Huygens' metasurface profiles along x -axis and y-axis, as:

### Gene regulatory network inference from sparsely sampled noisy data [^c4f997e1]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The GP framework can handle combinatorial effects, meaning nonlinearities that cannot be decomposed into f (x 1, x 2) = f 1 (x 1) + f 2 (x 2). This is an important property for modelling a chemical system — such as gene expression — where reactions can happen due to combined effects of reactant species. For example, the dynamics corresponding to a chemical reaction x 1 + x 2 → x 3 cannot be modelled by.

In a classical variable selection problem from input–output data η j = f (ξ j) + v j, for j = 1,…, N, where, the task is to find out which components of ξ does the function f depend on. In the GP framework, variable selection can be done by a technique known as "automatic relevance determination", based on estimating the hyperparameters of the covariance function of f. For BINGO, we have chosen the squared exponential covariance function for each component f i :The hyperparameters β i, j ≥ 0 are known as inverse length scales, sincecorresponds to a distance that has to be moved in the direction of the j th coordinate for the value of function f i to change considerably. If β i, j = 0, then f i is constant in the corresponding direction. The mean function for f i is m i (x) = b i − a i x i where a i and b i are regarded as nonnegative hyperparameters corresponding to mRNA degradation and basal transcription, respectively.

### Controlling nanowire growth through electric field-induced deformation of the catalyst droplet [^95c62f0d]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Simulations

The first step of the process of calculating the surface tension from the droplet deformation is to identify, using edge detection algorithms on thresholded images, the points in each image corresponding to the electrode and the droplet/nanowire and droplet/vacuum interfaces. These points were used to obtain the nanowire radius R, distance between nanowire and CE, and droplet geometry. From this, an idealized axisymmetric representation of the experimental geometry was created. The electric potential was calculated on this domain using the finite element method in Mathematica. The nanowire and droplet surface were arbitrarily set to ϕ = 0 and the CE to ϕ = V; the natural boundary conditionis applied everywhere else. We solve the system in dimensionless form using the measured R and known V to scale the system: and.

Once the electric field distribution along the droplet has been found, it can be used to obtain the Maxwell stress distribution, which, for a conducting droplet, modifies the Young–Laplace equation as follows:

We can take advantage of the additional symmetry at the apex to define the unknown constant Δ P 0 in terms of the mean curvatureand apex electric fieldsuch that

Here s is the distance along the interface, starting at the apex of the droplet and following the droplet curvature. The principal curvatures can be recast in differential form asandfollowing Río et al. Equation 4, along with two geometric relationships, becomes the system:

with initial conditions

Non-dimensionalizing the system and boundary conditions according to the scales used in Equation 2 gives

with dimensionless Electric Bond Numberarising naturally. We find the best fit between the theoretical predictions (subscript t) and N points from the best-fit ellipse (subscript e) by minimizing the penalty function with respect to Ω

A more general penalty function is discussed in Río et al. which accounts for rotation of the acquired profile; however, the orientation of our profiles have already been determined using the best-fit ellipse from the image processing step. Once Ω has been determined, the surface tension can be found directly from.

### Alba shapes the archaeal genome using a delicate balance of bridging and stiffening the DNA [^839de420]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Alba1:Alba2 heterodimers lack cooperative binding behaviour

To investigate the functional differences and interplay between the two homologous Alba proteins we characterized the effect of Alba1:Alba2 heterodimers on the mechanical properties of the DNA. The functional and structural consequences of Alba1:Alba2 heterodimer formation are best quantitatively addressed in the absence of Alba1 and Alba2 homodimers. When mixed at a 1:1 ratio — as in our experiments — only heterodimers are formed. We find that these heterodimers increase the persistence length of DNA (Fig. 2c, magenta triangles), yet, to a lower extent than Alba1. The impact of the Alba1:Alba2 heterodimer on DNA is similar to that of the Alba1 F60A mutant, indicating that the F60 residue has an essential role in the cooperative increase of the persistence length (Fig. 2c, green squares). To quantify this effect we determined the fractional coverage as a function of the protein concentration for both Alba1:Alba2 heterodimers and the Alba F60A mutant using Equation 5 (Fig. 2d, magenta triangles and green squares, respectively). To investigate whether both binding curves are consistent with a loss in cooperativity, we plotted the McGhee-von Hippel model (Equation 6) using the derived binding affinity for Alba1 (K = 4 × 10 2 nM −1), the same binding site (n = 5 bp) but without cooperativity (ω = 1). The McGhee-von Hippel binding isotherm using these parameters describes both the Alba1:Alba2 heterodimer and Alba F60A binding curve very well (Fig. 2d, dotted line), reaffirming that the F60 residue is responsible for side-by-side cooperative dimer–dimer interactions. We also assessed the influence of Alba1:Alba2 heterodimers within a context of abundant Alba1 homodimers (at a ratio of 1:20), which can be encountered in an in vivo situation. However, at this ratio the small amount of Alba2 had no detectable effect on the cooperative formation of the Alba1 filament.

### Experimental determination of pore shape and size using q-space NMR microscopy in the long diffusion-time limit [^2a45026d]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2003). Low credibility.

The signal obtained with q-space NMR imaging applied to a confined liquid is directly related to the pore shape in the limit where all molecules have sampled the whole pore. We investigate the diffusion of water across a approximately 50 microm thick film formed between planes of glass. The diffusion time t is changed almost three orders of magnitude. For short t, the root-mean-square displacement increases with a rate which is slightly less than for freely diffusing water. At t longer than 0.3 s, the displacement is constant at 24 microm which implies that the water is confined in the measuring direction defined by the applied gradient pulses. Perfectly smooth and aligned planes give rise to sharp diffraction-like features on the echo attenuation curve, i.e. NMR signal vs. the reciprocal space vector q. The experimental data with rather smooth local minima and maxima can be explained in terms of either surface roughness or a misalignment of the planes. We discuss the averaging effect of diffusion along a laterally inhomogeneous film and propose two model-free methods to determine the pore shape from the echo attenuation curve obtained in the long-t limit.

### Mathematical modeling for slide tracheoplasty [^4bf6c033]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The objective of this study is to create a mathematical model and calculate precise cut lengths for slide tracheoplasty (ST) to achieve better postoperative results. This study also is a pioneer in a novel field where mathematics and medicine intersect and is aimed to be used for achieving precise preoperative planning for many risky medical procedures. In ST, the trachea is divided into two segments with two longitudinal cuts and one oblique cut. These segments are then slid onto each other to widen the lumen of the stenotic segment. The postoperative stenotic segment diameter is directly determined by the longitudinal incisions and the subsequent oblique incision. We propose a mathematical model to estimate tracheal cut lengths preoperatively to achieve the desired tracheal lumen diameter.

Methods

The oblique cut creates an ellipse. After sliding, the suture line becomes the perimeter of another ellipse, equal to the sum of the initial ellipse perimeter and twice the longitudinal cut length. Longitudinal cuts determine the angle of the oblique cut and lengthen the perimeter of the final ellipse, the horizontal projection of which is a circle with the desired tracheal diameter. This mathematical model uses a novel perimeter equation, two geometric constraints, and a novel tissue area constraint. Exact solutions are found. Using this model, the longitudinal cut length to achieve the target diameter is determined preoperatively.

Results

The mathematical model provides a closed-form solution to calculate the necessary longitudinal cut lengths to achieve a desired postoperative tracheal diameter. It integrates geometric and tissue area constraints to accurately predict the final lumen size. A practical implementation of the model was developed in Microsoft Excel, allowing for user-friendly, real-time calculation of cut lengths with adjustable inputs for preoperative tracheal dimensions and target diameters.

Conclusions

We present a novel mathematical model for preoperative planning in ST. By precisely linking incision geometry to final tracheal diameter, this tool supports more accurate and individualized surgical planning. The model offers a promising example of how mathematical approaches can enhance precision in complex surgical procedures and improve clinical outcomes.

15 g tube length x width + 4

Using the calculations for ulcer size in centimeters, each square centimeter of ulcer surface will require approximately a 0.25 centimeter length of gel squeezed from a 15 g tube. For example, if the ulcer measures 4 cm by 2 cm, then a 2 cm length of gel should be used for a 15 g tube [14 x 21 + 4 = 21. The amount of REGRANEX to be applied should be recalculated by the physician or wound caregiver at weekly or biweekly intervals depending on the rate of change in ulcer area. The weight of REGRANEX from 15 g tubes is 0.65g per inch length and 0.25 g per centimeter length.

To apply REGRANEX, the calculated length of gel should be squeezed on to a ciean measuring surface, e.g., wax paper, and measured to the correct length with a ruler. The measured REGRANEX is transferred from the clean measuring surface using an application aid and then spread over the entire cleaned ulcer area to yield a thin continuous layer of approximately 1/16 of an inch thickness. The site(s) of application should then be covered by a saline moistened gauze dressing and left in place for approximately 12 hours. The dressing should then be removed and the ulcer rinsed with saline or water to remove residual gel and covered again with a moist primary dressing (without REGRANEX gel) for the remainder of the day. REGRANEX should be applied once daily to the ulcer until complete healing has occurred. If the ulcer does not decrease in size by approximately 30% after 10 weeks of treatment or complete healing has not occurred in 20 weeks, continued treatment with REGRANEX should be reassessed. The step-by-step instructions for applying REGRANEX in a home care setting can be found in the FDA-approved Instructions for Use.

### Evaluating diffusion dispersion across an extended range of b-values and frequencies: exploiting gap-filled OGSE shapes, strong gradients, and spiral readouts [^d6946c53]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
Comparison of OGSE gradient waveforms, their zeroth moments (q‐space trajectories), and q‐space cumulative integrals (left) and gradient moment power spectra (right). Each quantity is plotted for: (A) a standard OGSE waveform with a half‐period gap and a correction to the external lobes to null the cumulative gradient area, (B) an original gap‐filled OGSE shape with gap duration T gap, and (C) a further modified gap‐filled shape providing flow compensation. Like quantities are plotted to the same scale with units arbitrary. All OGSE gradient shapes have the same oscillation period T (corresponding to oscillation frequency ω 0 = 2π/ T) and amplitude. The second gradient pulse for each shape is a time‐reversed and inverted version of the first gradient pulse, as gradient plots show effective shapes by accounting for the inversion of the first gradient pulse by the refocusing RF pulse. The outer lobes of gradient shapes (A) and (B) are specified as having durations of T /4 and T /2 for simplicity, but the timing corrections (which cannot be discerned on this scale) slightly alter their true durations. These shapes are plotted for 30 Hz waveforms with gradient amplitude 80 mT/m, slew rate 200 mT/m/ms, and gap duration 4.4 ms. Relative differences between the power spectra have only minor dependencies on these parameters and principally depend on the relative durations of a period, a ramp, and the gap

### Resolution limit of cylinder diameter estimation by diffusion MRI: the impact of gradient waveform and orientation dispersion [^5706a3d8]. NMR in Biomedicine (2017). Low credibility.

Diffusion MRI has been proposed as a non-invasive technique for axonal diameter mapping. However, accurate estimation of small diameters requires strong gradients, which is a challenge for the transition of the technique from preclinical to clinical MRI scanners, since these have weaker gradients. In this work, we develop a framework to estimate the lower bound for accurate diameter estimation, which we refer to as the resolution limit. We analyse only the contribution from the intra-axonal space and assume that axons can be represented by impermeable cylinders. To address the growing interest in using techniques for diffusion encoding that go beyond the conventional single diffusion encoding (SDE) sequence, we present a generalised analysis capable of predicting the resolution limit regardless of the gradient waveform. Using this framework, waveforms were optimised to minimise the resolution limit. The results show that, for parallel cylinders, the SDE experiment is optimal in terms of yielding the lowest possible resolution limit. In the presence of orientation dispersion, diffusion encoding sequences with square-wave oscillating gradients were optimal. The resolution limit for standard clinical MRI scanners (maximum gradient strength 60-80mT/m) was found to be between 4 and 8μm, depending on the noise levels and the level of orientation dispersion. For scanners with a maximum gradient strength of 300mT/m, the limit was reduced to between 2 and 5μm.

Definition and diagnosis of lateralized overgrowth (LO) — In 2017, the terms "isolated hemihypertrophy" and "isolated hemihyperplasia" were replaced by LO, defined as "significantly larger length and/or girth of aspect(s) of one side of the body compared with its contralateral side". The diagnosis of LO is usually based on physical examination, and although length or girth discrepancies of 10% or more are usually visually apparent, experienced examiners may detect more subtle asymmetries; given the variability and subjectivity, no objective parameters have been established and it is generally left to the examiner to decide if findings warrant further evaluation.

### Medial packing and elastic asymmetry stabilize the double-gyroid in block copolymers [^f77b759f]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fig. 2
Subdomain tessellations for strong-segregation chain packing.

Schematic of chain packing within a variably-shaped morphology is shown in (a) where z labels local extension of blocks from the IMDS. b Shows a (volume balanced) tessellation of the nodal region of DG, generated via the medial SST construction. c Shows a sequence of medial SST geometries (at fixed composition f = 0.3) highlighting lateral spreading of terminal webs achieved via parametric variation of DG generating surfaces (as described in the text).

Per Eq. (2), maximizing entropy of component blocks is equivalent to minimizing second-moments of volume measured relative to the IMDS. Chain packing is, in this sense, a variant of the quantizer problem, which seeks tessellations that minimize the second-moment of distance from a set of generating points, generalized to measure distance with respect to generating surfaces. Given an IMDS shape, the medial map would provide the optimal I α for each domain considered in isolation. However, as shown in Supplementary Note 3, the medial map generically fails to satisfy the local volume balance constraint. Moreover, stable morphologies also optimize the competition between IMDS area minimization and block stretching.

To model this thermodynamic competition and test how closely physical assemblies come to realizing medial packing, we apply the following medial SST approach to DG morphologies (see Methods, Supplementary Note 3–4). In brief, our approach, summarized in Supplementary Fig. 7, uses the medial map of gyroidal surfaces to generate terminal sets (both A and B ends) from which a set of space filling chain trajectories are derived along with an IMDS consistent with the volume balance constraint for each chain trajectory, resulting in mutually compatible terminal boundaries, IMDS, and trajectories, as shown in Fig. 2 b. We then optimize the computed free energies over the variational family of generating gyroidal surfaces – corresponding to variable shapes and sizes of the terminal surfaces as shown Fig. 2 c — to determine and analyze thermodynamically preferred DG chain packing. Notably, local volume balance generally requires some measure of tilt between trajectories and the IMDS, a signature of the deviation from strictly medial packing which we return to below.

### Drug-eluting stents in bifurcations: bench study of strut deformation and coating lesions [^de8d48c0]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The use of a drug-eluting stent (DES) has strongly limited the incidence of in-stent restenosis in bifurcation lesions; nevertheless, restenosis still remains a problem at the origin of the bifurcation side branch. The aim of this study is to analyze the consequences of the kissing postdilatation technique on 5 DESs, using microfocus x-ray computerized tomography and scanning electron microscopy.

Methods and Results

Five different DESs (Cypher, Cypher Select, Endeavor, Taxus Express, and Taxus Liberté) were deployed using kissing postdilatation protocols in a bench-top model. For all types of DES, microfocus x-ray computerized tomography analysis showed that (1) kissing postdilatation of the stent by 2 coaxial balloons caused elliptic deformation in the proximal segment and (2) kissing postdilatation technique reduced the ratio of potential metal to artery (manufacturer's data/calculated ratio: Cypher, 12.7/8.8; Cypher Select, 13.5/10.2; Endeavor, 19.0/13.3; Taxus Express, 20.5/4.7; Taxus Liberté, 17.9/12.5) and the potential drug application to area in the proximal segment, including the ostial struts (struts adjacent to and lying around the side branch ostium) (manufacturer's data/calculated drug application [microg/mm(2)]: Cypher, 1.4/1.0; Cypher Select, 1.4/1.1; Endeavor, 1.6/1.1; Taxus Express, 1.0/0.7; Taxus Liberté, 1.0/0.7). Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed a significantly greater coating damage to the ostial struts in all stents evaluated (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Commercially available DESs subjected to simultaneous kissing balloon postdilatation in an unconstrained model may contribute to side branch ostial restenosis by proximal segment elliptic deformation and damage to the polymer coating.

### Uniform two-dimensional square assemblies from conjugated block copolymers driven by π-π interactions with controllable sizes [^e662883e]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

To control the scales of the achieved square micelles, we investigated the concentration dependence of the self-assembly of PPV 12 - b -P2VP n and the results were quite interesting. The scales of the formed square micelles of PPV 12 - b -P2VP 12 were significantly concentration dependent. The diagonal length of the square micelles formed in 0.01 mg mL −1 2-PrOH solution was ~2,750 nm, whereas the diagonal length was reduced to ~2,000 nm when the concentration of the solution was decreased to 0.005 mg mL −1. When the solution concentration was halved again, the diagonal length of the formed square micelles further decreased to only ~1,300 nm (Fig. 3a–c). The obtained 2-D square micelles of PPV 12 - b -P2VP 16 also showed concentration dependence, but the phenomenon was not as obvious as it was with the micelles of PPV 12 - b -P2VP 12. The diagonal length of the square micelles formed in 2-PrOH solutions continued to decrease as the concentrations were halved from 0.01 all the way to 0.0025 mg mL −1; the diagonal lengths were ~ 1,950, 1,400, and 850 nm (Fig. 3d–f), respectively. When the P2VP blocks of the copolymer became longer, meaning that the R PPV/P2VP value was < 1: 2, the concentration dependence of the self-assembly of PPV 12 - b -P2VP n disappeared completely. For example, the diagonal lengths of the square micelles of PPV 12 - b -P2VP 22 formed in 2-PrOH solution with concentrations of 0.05, 0.02, and 0.01 mg mL −1 were all ~550 nm with very little variation. Similarly, the diagonal lengths of the formed square micelles of PPV 12 - b -P2VP 36 were only ~250 nm, which did not change when the concentration of the solution was decreased.

### Medial packing and elastic asymmetry stabilize the double-gyroid in block copolymers [^136613e3]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Triply-periodic networks are among the most complex and functionally valuable self-assembled morphologies, yet they form in nearly every class of biological and synthetic soft matter building blocks. In contrast to simpler assembly motifs - spheres, cylinders, layers - networks require molecules to occupy variable local environments, confounding attempts to understand their formation. Here, we examine the double-gyroid network phase by using a geometric formulation of the strong stretching theory of block copolymer melts, a prototypical soft self-assembly system. The theory establishes the direct link between molecular packing, assembly thermodynamics and the medial map, a generic measure of the geometric center of complex shapes. We show that "medial packing" is essential for stability of double-gyroid in strongly-segregated melts, reconciling a long-standing contradiction between infinite- and finite-segregation theories. Additionally, we find a previously unrecognized non-monotonic dependence of network stability on the relative entropic elastic stiffness of matrix-forming to tubular-network forming blocks. The composition window of stable double-gyroid widens for both large and small elastic asymmetry, contradicting intuitive notions that packing frustration is localized to the tubular domains. This study demonstrates the utility of optimized medial tessellations for understanding soft-molecular assembly and packing frustration via an approach that is readily generalizable far beyond gyroids in neat block copolymers.

### Tumor length and location of cancer on biopsy predict for side specific extraprostatic cancer extension [^2ef62623]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

We studied preoperative variables in a contemporary series of men who underwent nonnerve sparing radical prostatectomy in an effort to establish criteria that would predict side specific extraprostatic extension (EPE) of cancer.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed the records of 430 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer with no prior therapy between 1996 and 1998, and for whom we had at least sextant biopsy information. We evaluated biopsy data (Gleason score, maximum length of cancer in positive cores, percent of cancer per involved core, proportion of positive biopsy cores, tumor location and number of positive biopsy cores) and correlated these findings with EPE at the neurovascular bundle and posterior lateral (NVB/PL) region.

Results

We found that a higher number of positive cores, a higher biopsy Gleason score on a side, a positive core at the basal region, 50% or greater tumor in the core or a maximum tumor length of 7 mm or greater increased the likelihood that EPE was present at the NVB/PL region on the corresponding side of the prostate. On multivariate analysis maximum tumor length 7 mm or greater and positive basal core location were the strongest independent predictors of EPE at the NVB/PL region on a given side (p < 0.0001 and 0.002, respectively).

Conclusions

Excluding any patient with 1 positive biopsy core with a maximum tumor length of 7 mm or greater plus a positive basal core of any tumor length and grade can decrease the risk of EPE at the NVB/PL region to approximately 10%.

### Nitroglycerin (Nitro-bid) [^72989e6a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:

As noted above (CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY), controlled trials have demonstrated that nitroglycerin ointment can effectively reduce exercise-related angina for up to 7 hours after a single application. Doses used in clinical trials have ranged from 1/2 inch (1.3 cm; 7.5 mg) to 2 inches (5.1 cm; 30 mg), typically applied to 36 square inches (232 square centimeters) of truncal skin.

It is reasonable to believe that the rate and extent of nitroglycerin absorption from ointment may vary with the site and square measure of the skin over which a given dose of ointment is spread, but these relationships have not been adequately studied.

Controlled trials with other formulations of nitroglycerin have demonstrated that if plasma levels are maintained continuously, all anti-anginal efficacy is lost within 24 hours. This tolerance cannot be overcome by increasing the dose of nitroglycerin. As a result, any regimen of NITRO-BID®administration should include a daily nitrate-free interval. The minimum necessary length of such an interval has not been defined, but studies with other nitroglycerin formulations have shown that 10 to 12 hours is sufficient.

Thus, one appropriate dosing schedule for NITRO-BID®would begin with two daily 1/2- inch (7.5 mg) doses, one applied on rising in the morning and one applied six hours later. The dose could be doubled, and even doubled again, in patients tolerating this dose but failing to respond to it. The foilpac is intended as a unit dose package only and is equivalent to approximately 1 inch as squeezed from the tube. Use entire contents of foilpac to obtain full dose and discard immediately after use.

Each tube of ointment and each box of foilpacs is supplied with a pad of ruled, impermeable, paper applicators. These applicators allow ointment to be absorbed through a much smaller area of skin than that used in any of the reported clinical trials, and the significance of this difference is not known. To apply the ointment using one of the applicators, place the applicator on a flat surface, printed side down. Squeeze the necessary amount of ointment from the tube onto the applicator, place the applicator (ointment side down) on the desired area of the skin, and tape the applicator into place.

Methods

Medial strong segregation theory for double gyroid

The medial strong segregation theory calculation optimizes the SST free energy, Supplementary Eq. (11), over the variational family of generating gyroidal surfaces to determine and analyze thermodynamically preferred DG chain packing. Complete details on the construction of tessellating chain configurations and the variational algorithm are given in Supplementary Note 3–4.

We begin with a broad set of generating surfaces G withsymmetry; here we have chosen G as level sets of a three Fourier-mode expansion of the gyroid symmetry. From the medial map of G (for the double network) we generate the terminal boundaries of both domains, T A and T B, referring to the tubular and matrix domains respectively. The induced map between T A and T B approximates the mean trajectories of domain-spanning chains, which occupy local volumes approximated by triangular prismatic wedges, thus providing a complete tessellation of the DG structure. The location of the IMDS is then determined along each trajectory according to the constraints of volume balance and chain composition, resulting in mutually compatible terminal boundaries, IMDS, and trajectories, as shown in Fig. 2 b, from which we compute the geometric contribution to the free energy in Eq. (1). Notably, local volume balance generally requires some measure of tilt between trajectories and the IMDS, such that the terminal surfaces of the ultimate volume-balanced packing deviate at least slightly from the medial surfaces of the final IMDS. As shown in Fig. 2 c, variation of the generating surface leads to variation in compatible IMDS shapes and variable spreading of the terminal boundaries for fixed block composition f, which we then optimize over (see Supplementary Note 4).

Skeletal strong segregation theory ansatz for double gyroid

We employ a variant of the medial SST approach to model the DG assemblies whose terminal sets are constrained to lie along the skeletal graphs of the double network, in a effort to closely recapitulate and compare to prior results from ref. Complete details are provided in Supplementary Note 5. In brief, we construct a variational set of skeletal tessellations via projection of the terminal positions in the tubular domains from the "web-like" medial surfaces of double-gyroids to the nearby positions along the skeletal graph. Finally, we optimize the free energy over the free parameters of the map that takes points on the tubular domain medial surface to points on the skeletal graph.

### LinkedSV for detection of mosaic structural variants from linked-read exome and genome sequencing data [^de81cbd2]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Breakpoint detection from type 2 evidence

Barcode similarity between two nearby regions is very high because the reads originate from almost the same set of HMW DNA molecules. However, at the SV breakpoint, the aligned reads from the left side and right side may have originated from different locations in the alternative genome. Thus, the barcode similarity between the left side and right side of the breakpoint are dramatically reduced (as described in the Result section and shown in Fig. 1e, f). To detect this, LinkedSV uses two adjacent sliding windows (twin windows, moving 100 bp) to scan the genome and calculate the barcode similarity between the twin windows. The window length can be specified by user. By default, it is G for WGS data sets and 40 kb for WES data sets.

The barcode similarity can be simply calculated as the fraction of shared barcodes. This method is suitable for WGS, where the coverage is continuous and uniform. But it does not perform well for WES, where the numbers of reads in the sliding windows vary a lot due to capture bias and the length of capture regions. Therefore, we use a model that considering the variation of sequencing depth and capture region positions. The barcode similarity is calculated as

where m 1 is the number of barcodes in window 1, m 2 is the number of barcodes in window 2, x is the number of barcodes in both windows, d is the weight distance between reads of the left window and the right window, n is a constant representing the characteristic of the library, α is a parameter of fragment length distribution, a and b are two parameters between 0 and 1, n, α, a, and b are estimated from the data using regression. Detailed explanation of this model is in Supplementary Note 1.

Next, we calculate the empirical distribution of barcode similarity. Regions where the barcode similarity less than a threshold (5th percentile of the empirical distribution by default) were regarded as breakpoint candidates. If a set of consecutive regions have barcode similarity lower than the threshold, we only retain the region that has the lowest barcode similarity. If the barcode similarity of a breakpoint candidate is S 0, the empirical p value is calculated asThe confidence score of type 2 evidence is

### Polarization nano-tomography of tightly focused light landscapes by self-assembled monolayers [^428ca32d]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Graphical fluorescence analysis

In order to analyze our experimental in comparison to numerical data in detail, we study the fluorescence intensity dependent on the azimuthal angle. Results are presented in Figs. 6 and 7. For this analysis, we first choose a ring-shaped subspace within fluorescence images, as marked in white in experimental (red edged) and numerical images (blue edged; original resolution). The ring is positioned in such a way that it embeds most conspicuous characteristics of intensity images while having a width of 2–3 pixels in experiment (10–12 pixels in numerics). In the next step, the ring is devided into angular segments of size δα with at least including three intensity pixels in the experimental case (experiment or simulation: δα = 10° to 45° or δα = 5° to 10°). We calculate the mean values of the normalized intensity per angular segment within the ring and plot these in dependence on the respective angular position α (central value of angular segment; see Figs. 6 or 7a, bottom left). Experimental and numerical data points are visualized by red and blue circles within graphs, respectively.

For experiment and simulation, the errors in intensity represent the standard deviation of the respective mean value. The angular position error Δ α for the experimental results considers the PSF of the imaging system and the self-excitation of neighboring molecules. More precisely, we assume each molecule of the SAM as a self-luminous point in the microscopic imaging system, so that the transverse position error (Cartesian coordinates) of this point can be described by the half of the full width half maximum (FWHM) of the PSF given by(wavelength of fluorescence λ fl = 594 nm; NA of imaging MO NA im = 0.9). Further, we consider the possible self-excitation with a maximum interaction distance of four molecules, i.e. an additional error in transverse position of ± 4 ⋅ s, s = 2 nm (s: long axis of fluorescent molecule). Hence, in total, we calculate a transverse position error ofFrom this, we can derive the angular error via propagation of uncertainty, resulting inwith r as the central radius of the ring subspace. Obviously, by increasing NA im or decreasing λ fl one can reduce the FWHM and, thereby, Δ x or Δ α, which improves lateral imaging resolution.
