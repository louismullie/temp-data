## Question

What is the difference between Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BIPAP) and Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure with Spontaneous Timed (BIPAP ST)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the difference between Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) and Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure with Spontaneous/Timed (BiPAP S/T). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and the core distinction in trigger behavior. Then, I should verify the clinical implications for hypercapnic respiratory failure and encephalopathy. Next, I will review device performance and leak compensation, followed by guideline-based indications. Finally, I will synthesize practical selection criteria and note any nuances or exceptions that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions so I don't misstate anything. BiPAP delivers two pressure levels — a higher inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and a lower expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) — and responds to patient-triggered breaths; in contrast, BiPAP S/T adds a timed backup respiratory rate that delivers mandatory breaths if the patient fails to trigger within the set window, thereby ensuring a minimum minute ventilation and preventing apnea or hypoventilation.

> Wait, let me verify the clinical implications of that difference, because it's easy to overgeneralize. In hypercapnic respiratory failure — especially with altered mental status or risk of hypoventilation — BiPAP S/T is preferred because the backup rate safeguards ventilation when respiratory drive is unreliable; this is particularly relevant in COPD with hypercapnic encephalopathy, where AVAPS-enabled S/T modes can rapidly correct alveolar hypoventilation and improve consciousness compared with standard S/T alone, though the evidence base is limited and heterogeneous [^74efcfdf] [^1fab462d] [^052ae596].

> Hold on, I should review device performance and leak compensation, since that affects real-world delivery. Lung-model and bench studies show that leak can degrade delivered tidal volume and trigger cycling, and that S/T devices vary in their ability to compensate; importantly, intentional mask leaks can reduce achieved IPAP and tidal volume, and S/T algorithms may be more robust in some platforms, though performance is vendor-specific and settings matter for maintaining effective ventilation during leaks [^c1cfe233] [^60a9dc27].

> Next, I should review guideline direction to ensure my recommendations align with consensus. Contemporary critical care guidance supports BiPAP for hypercapnic respiratory failure and recommends S/T with a backup rate when ventilatory drive is impaired or unreliable; in contrast, for routine OSA without hypoventilation, CPAP or APAP is generally preferred over BiPAP, and S/T is not indicated unless there is specific hypoventilation physiology or CPAP intolerance at high pressures [^74efcfdf] [^3cebad98].

> I need to ensure I capture the practical selection criteria clearly. Choose BiPAP S/T when there is hypercapnic respiratory failure with risk of hypoventilation, altered mental status, or observed apneas; choose standard BiPAP when the patient is awake, breathing spontaneously, and primarily needs pressure support for work-of-breathing reduction without a mandate for guaranteed backup breaths; and consider AVAPS within S/T when rapid correction of minute ventilation and CO2 is prioritized, recognizing the evidence is suggestive but not definitive [^74efcfdf] [^1fab462d].

> But wait, what if the patient has primarily hypoxemic respiratory failure rather than hypercapnia. I should double-check that nuance. In de novo acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, high-flow nasal therapy is often first-line, and while CPAP or BiPAP can be used selectively, the mode choice should be individualized; BiPAP S/T does not offer a clear advantage over CPAP for oxygenation alone, and the risk of delayed intubation must be monitored closely in severe hypoxemia [^74efcfdf] [^3fc96388].

> Let me reconsider any potential pitfalls in terminology so I don't propagate confusion. Some literature and device manuals conflate "BiPAP" with "S/T", so I should confirm the exact mode being discussed in context; when in doubt, ask whether the device has a set backup rate and whether AVAPS or volume-assured features are active, because that determines whether the system will deliver mandatory breaths in the absence of patient effort [^c1cfe233].

> In summary, the key difference is that BiPAP S/T adds a timed backup respiratory rate to standard BiPAP, ensuring ventilatory support when patient effort is absent or insufficient; clinically, this makes S/T the preferred modality for hypercapnic respiratory failure with unreliable drive, with AVAPS further enhancing volume assurance in select scenarios, while standard BiPAP remains appropriate for cooperative patients with intact ventilatory drive who need pressure support without mandatory breaths [^d0696237] [^74efcfdf] [^1fab462d].

BiPAP provides two pressure levels (IPAP and EPAP) for **spontaneous breathing** with no guaranteed backup breaths, whereas BiPAP ST adds a **timed backup rate** to ensure a minimum ventilation when spontaneous breathing is inadequate. BiPAP is used for stable patients with obstructive sleep apnea or mild respiratory failure, while BiPAP ST is indicated for **hypercapnic respiratory failure**, central sleep apnea, or when respiratory drive is unreliable. The key difference is the **backup rate**, which makes BiPAP ST safer for patients at risk of hypoventilation or apnea.

---

## Definitions and basic functionality

### BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure)

- **Pressure levels**: Delivers two distinct pressure levels — inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP).
- **Spontaneous breathing**: Patients breathe spontaneously, and the device synchronizes with their respiratory efforts.
- **No backup rate**: Does not provide a guaranteed minimum respiratory rate; ventilation depends entirely on patient effort.

---

### BiPAP ST (spontaneous/timed)

- **Backup rate**: Adds a timed backup respiratory rate to ensure a minimum ventilation if spontaneous breathing is inadequate.
- **Spontaneous/timed mode**: Combines spontaneous triggering with timed breaths, providing safety for patients with unreliable respiratory drive.
- **Clinical utility**: Particularly useful in hypercapnic respiratory failure, central sleep apnea, and other conditions with intermittent or unreliable breathing.

---

## Clinical indications

| **Clinical scenario** | **BiPAP** | **BiPAP ST** |
|-|-|-|
| Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) | Commonly used | Not typically indicated |
| Mild respiratory failure | Appropriate | Not typically indicated |
| Hypercapnic respiratory failure (e.g. COPD exacerbation) | Limited efficacy | Preferred due to backup rate |
| Central sleep apnea | Not indicated | Preferred due to backup rate |
| Neuromuscular disorders with unreliable respiratory drive | Not indicated | Preferred due to backup rate |
| Post-extubation support in high-risk patients | Limited efficacy | Preferred due to backup rate |

---

## Physiological differences

- **Work of breathing**: Both modes reduce work of breathing, but BiPAP ST provides additional support via timed breaths, further unloading respiratory muscles in patients with inadequate drive.
- **Gas exchange**: BiPAP ST improves CO2 elimination and oxygenation more effectively in hypercapnic patients by ensuring adequate minute ventilation.
- **Patient-ventilator synchrony**: Both modes aim for synchrony, but BiPAP ST may cause asynchrony if timed breaths conflict with patient effort; careful titration is required.

---

## Advantages and disadvantages

### BiPAP

Advantages include **simplicity and comfort** for stable patients, with widespread use in OSA and mild respiratory failure, whereas disadvantages include the lack of a backup rate, which makes it unsuitable for patients with unreliable respiratory drive or severe hypercapnia.

---

### BiPAP ST

Advantages include a **backup rate** that ensures ventilation in patients with unreliable drive or severe hypercapnia, making it versatile across multiple clinical scenarios; disadvantages include greater complexity, the potential for asynchrony, and the need for careful monitoring and titration.

---

## Clinical outcomes

Evidence supports BiPAP for OSA and mild respiratory failure, whereas **BiPAP ST is superior for hypercapnic respiratory failure**, reducing intubation rates and improving gas exchange. In COPD exacerbations with hypercapnic encephalopathy, BiPAP ST with AVAPS accelerates recovery of consciousness and improves ventilation compared with standard BiPAP [^052ae596].

---

## Practical considerations

- **Device selection**: Choose BiPAP for stable patients with intact respiratory drive; choose BiPAP ST for patients with unreliable drive, hypercapnic failure, or central sleep apnea.
- **Monitoring**: BiPAP ST requires closer monitoring for asynchrony, mask leaks, and adequacy of ventilation.
- **Patient education**: Educate patients on mask fit, leak management, and recognition of hypoventilation symptoms.

---

BiPAP and BiPAP ST differ primarily in that **BiPAP ST adds a timed backup rate** to ensure ventilation when spontaneous breathing is inadequate. This makes BiPAP ST the preferred choice for hypercapnic respiratory failure, central sleep apnea, and other conditions with unreliable respiratory drive, whereas BiPAP remains appropriate for stable patients with intact ventilatory control.

Bi-Level Positive Airway Pressure

The term BiPAP is often, inappropriately, synonymously used for nIPPV. BiPAP provides two CPAP levels (3–6 cm H 2 O and a higher setting of up to 11–15 cm H 2 O), over which the infant breathes independently. There is a much smaller difference between the two pressures as compared to the difference between the PEEP and PiP in nIPPV, and therefore, the MAP generated by BiPAP may not be too different from that seen with high levels of CPAP. Furthermore, another important difference in inspiratory time between nIPPV (short) and BiPAP (long) again contributes to the differences in achieved MAP per modality.

### Airway pressure release ventilation: what do we know? [^75ca0b76]. Respiratory Care (2012). Low credibility.

Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) is inverse ratio, pressure controlled, intermittent mandatory ventilation with unrestricted spontaneous breathing. It is based on the principle of open lung approach. It has many purported advantages over conventional ventilation, including alveolar recruitment, improved oxygenation, preservation of spontaneous breathing, improved hemodynamics, and potential lung-protective effects. It has many claimed disadvantages related to risks of volutrauma, increased work of breathing, and increased energy expenditure related to spontaneous breathing. APRV is used mainly as a rescue therapy for the difficult to oxygenate patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is confusion regarding this mode of ventilation, due to the different terminology used in the literature. APRV settings include the "P high", "T high", "P low", and "T low". Physicians and respiratory therapists should be aware of the different ways and the rationales for setting these variables on the ventilators. Also, they should be familiar with the differences between APRV, biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP), and other conventional and nonconventional modes of ventilation. There is no solid proof that APRV improves mortality; however, there are ongoing studies that may reveal further information about this mode of ventilation. This paper reviews the different methods proposed for APRV settings, and summarizes the different studies comparing APRV and BIPAP, and the potential benefits and pitfalls for APRV.

Key messages

- 	BiPAP does not offer any significant clinical benefit over CPAP in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema.

- 	Until a large randomized control trial can show that BiPAP is associated with significant clinical benefits or is more cost-effective than CPAP in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, the choice of modality will depend mainly on the equipment available.

### Functional differences in bi-level pressure preset ventilators [^4feda6dc]. The European Respiratory Journal (2001). Low credibility.

The performance of four bilevel positive pressure preset ventilators was compared. The ventilators tested were; BiPAP ST30 (Respironics); Nippy2 (B + D Electrical); Quantum PSV (Healthdyne); and Sullivan VPAP H ST (Resmed). A patient simulator was used to determine the sensitivity of the triggering mechanisms and the responses to a leak within the patient circuit, and to changes in patient effort. Significant differences (p < 0.05) between the devices were seen in the trigger delay time and inspiratory trigger pressure. When a leak was introduced into the patient circuit, the fall in tidal volume (VT) was less than ten per cent for each ventilator. The addition of patient effort produced a number of changes in the ventilation delivered. Patient efforts of 0.25 s induced a variable fall in VT. An increase in VT was seen with some ventilators with patient efforts of 1 s but the effect was variable. Trigger failures and subsequent falls in minute volume were seen with the BiPAP and the Nippy2 at the highest respiratory frequency. Differences in the responses of the ventilators are demonstrated that may influence the selection of a ventilator, particularly in the treatment of breathless patients with ventilatory failure.

### Non-invasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure: a randomised comparison of continuous positive airway pressure and bi-level positive airway pressure [^4c71df6c]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether there is a difference in required duration of non-invasive ventilation between continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) in the treatment of a heterogeneous group of emergency department (ED) patients suffering acute respiratory failure and the subgroup of patients with acute pulmonary oedema (APO). Secondary objectives were to compare complications, failure rate, disposition, length of stay parameters, and mortality between the treatments.

Methods

This prospective randomised trial was conducted in the emergency departments of three Australian teaching hospitals. Patients in acute respiratory failure were randomly assigned to receive CPAP or BiPAP in addition to standard therapy. Duration of non-invasive ventilation, complications, failure rate, disposition, length of stay (hospital and ICU), and mortality were measured.

Results

101 patients were enrolled in the study (CPAP 51, BiPAP 50). The median duration of non-invasive ventilation with CPAP was 123 minutes (range 10–338) and 132 minutes (range 20–550) for BiPAP (p = 0.206, Mann-Whitney). For the subgroup suffering APO, 36 were randomised to CPAP and 35 to BiPAP. For this group the median duration of non-invasive ventilation for CPAP was 123 minutes (range 35–338) and 133 minutes (range 30–550) for BiPAP (p = 0.320, Mann-Whitney).

Conclusions

These results suggest that there is no significant difference in the duration of non-invasive ventilation treatment between CPAP and BiPAP when used for the treatment of acute respiratory failure in the ED. There was also no significant difference between the groups in secondary end points.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute heart failure syndromes: approved by ACEP board of directors, June 23, 2022 [^a9dc0409]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Noninvasive ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] and bilevel positive airway pressure [BiPAP]) in acute heart failure — In a study of 89 consecutive elderly patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (PaO2/ FIO2 ≤ 300), CPAP reduced the need for ventilatory assistance and early 48-hour mortality compared with standard oxygen with no difference in hospital length of stay. Specifically, the need for ventilatory assistance was 17% less (P = 0.01) in the CPAP group (7%) compared to standard oxygen (24%), and early 48-hour mortality was 21% less (P = 0.017) in the CPAP group (9%) compared to standard oxygen (30%). Evidence for BiPAP was mixed: in a 2000 trial of 37 patients, intubation was significantly less with BiPAP (5% versus 33%; P = 0.04) with faster symptom resolution defined by oxygen saturation ≥ 96% and respiratory rate < 30 breaths/min, whereas a 1997 trial halted after enrollment of 27 patients found higher myocardial infarction in the BiPAP group (71%, N = 10, P = 0.06) versus CPAP (31%, N = 4) with extremely large 95% confidence intervals (9% to 76%). Additional studies showed no clear superiority or differences: an out-of-hospital comparison reported BiPAP was associated with increased intubation, myocardial infarction, and a combined endpoint within 24 hours; a 2001 convenience sample of 38 randomized to BiPAP or conventional oxygen found no statistically significant differences in heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygenation, rate of intubation, hospital length of stay, or myocardial infarction; a 2002 crossover study of 6 patients sequentially receiving CPAP 5 mm Hg, CPAP 10 mm Hg, and BiPAP 10/5 mm Hg found no significant difference in oxygenation or hemodynamic response; and a 2004 randomized head-to-head trial of 46 patients comparing CPAP 10 mm Hg to BiPAP 15/5 mm Hg found no differences in myocardial infarction, intubation, or inhospital mortality.

Mehta et al 1997 — randomized trial in acute pulmonary edema compared nasal BiPAP 15/5 (N = 14) with nasal CPAP 10 (N = 13) and was planned for 40 but stopped early; MI occurred more often with BiPAP than CPAP (MI: 11 BiPAP vs 4 CPAP [P = 0.02]); dyspnea, pCO2, respiratory rate, heart rate, pH, and BP were significantly lowered at 30 min in BiPAP, not CPAP, with no difference in secondary outcomes; mortality was CPAP = 2/13 and BiPAP = 1/14.

### Noninvasive respiratory support [^cdde3ae6]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Biphasic nasal continuous positive airway pressure (BiPAP) versus nCPAP — scope and trial details indicate that "BiPAP is a form of noninvasive ventilation that provides 2 alternating levels of continuous positive airway pressure at set intervals using nasal prongs or a facemask". "Two prospective randomized clinical trials have evaluated nCPAP versus BiPAP". In one trial, "Lista et al65 randomly assigned 40 preterm infants with RDS and a mean gestational age of 30 weeks to receive synchronized BiPAP (Infant Flow) or nCPAP (Infant Flow) after surfactant administration and extubation", and those "randomly assigned to receive nCPAP had a significantly longer duration of respiratory support".

Acute heart failure syndromes — noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation in the emergency department is addressed with graded recommendations and supporting evidence: Level A recommendations are none specified. Level B recommendations state to use 5 to 10 mm Hg CPAP by nasal or face mask for dyspneic patients with acute heart failure syndrome without hypotension or the need for emergent intubation to improve heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and reduce intubation and possibly reduce inhospital mortality. Level C recommendations state to consider using BiPAP as an alternative to CPAP for dyspneic patients with acute heart failure syndrome; however, data about the possible association between BiPAP and myocardial infarction remain unclear. Supporting text notes that initial studies of CPAP at 5 to 10 mm Hg consistently showed significant improvements in oxygenation and reductions in heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure versus standard oxygen therapy, yet with the exception of one study that showed a reduction in mortality, a statistically significant benefit over standard oxygen therapy has not been found for hospital length of stay and mortality.

### The effect of high-flow nasal oxygen on hospital length of stay in cardiac surgical patients at high risk for respiratory complications: a randomised controlled trial [^03d200a3]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

In a large (n = 830) 'non‐inferiority' multi‐centre randomised trial, high‐flow nasal oxygen was compared with BiPAP in patients with, or at risk of, respiratory failure after cardiothoracic surgery 40. The primary outcome in this study was treatment failure, which was defined as a composite of tracheal re‐intubation, switch to the other study therapy or early discontinuation of the assigned therapy, and the authors concluded that high‐flow nasal oxygen was not inferior to BiPAP. The control group in this study does not necessarily represent the standard of care or best practice because there are no robust data indicating that BiPAP improves outcomes in the cardiac surgery setting. In addition, by using a composite primary outcome, the effect may be small for important individual components (e.g. tracheal re‐intubation rate) and large for less important clinical components (e.g. crossover to another treatment group), limiting the generalisability of the results 41. A recent post‐hoc analysis in the subset of obese (BMI > 30 kg.m −2) patients from the same randomised controlled trial showed that continuous application of high‐flow nasal oxygen compared with intermittent BiPAP in patients with or without respiratory failure did not lead to a higher rate of treatment failure 42. The use of BiPAP was associated with improved oxygenation indices; however this did not translate into improved clinical outcomes.

### Neonatal non-invasive respiratory support: synchronised NIPPV, non-synchronised NIPPV or bi-level CPAP: what is the evidence in 2013? [^fe422ba3]. Neonatology (2013). Low credibility.

Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) has proven to be an effective mode of non-invasive respiratory support in preterm infants; however, many infants still require endotracheal ventilation, placing them at an increased risk of morbidities such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Several other modes of non-invasive respiratory support beyond NCPAP, including synchronised and non-synchronised nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (SNIPPV and nsNIPPV) and bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) are now also available. These techniques require different approaches, and the exact mechanisms by which they act remain unclear. SNIPPV has been shown to reduce the rate of reintubation in comparison to NCPAP when used as post-extubation support, but the evidence for nsNIPPV and BiPAP in this context is less convincing. There is some evidence that NIPPV (whether synchronised or non-synchronised) used as primary respiratory support is beneficial, but the variation in study methodology makes this hard to translate confidently into clinical practice. There is currently no evidence to suggest a reduction in mortality or important morbidities such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, with NIPPV or BiPAP in comparison to NCPAP, and there is a lack of appropriately designed studies in this area. This review discusses the different approaches and proposed mechanisms of action of SNIPPV, nsNIPPV and BiPAP, the challenges of applying the available evidence for these distinct modalities of non-invasive respiratory support to clinical practice, and possible areas of future research.

### Comparison of airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) versus biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) ventilation in COVID-19 associated ARDS using transpulmonary pressure monitoring [^edc86c2c]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Key findings

In our study, mean tidal volumes and mean plateau pressures presented to be higher in APRV vs. BIPAP. Nevertheless, neither in APRV nor in BIPAP, an increased endinspiratory TPP nor a difference in mechanical power could be detected. In contrast, endexpiratory TPP was negative in APRV vs. positive in BIPAP indicating an increased risk of atelectasis in APRV which would not have been detected without TPP monitoring.

Relation to previous studies.

Multiple studies already defined lung protective ventilation for volume- assist control mode of ventilation and ventilator settings in BIPAP- mode can be adjusted to these recommendations. But these recommendations are not applicable for APRV- mode. Lung protective settings in APRV have been described using the time- controlled adaptive ventilation (TCAV) method. In APRV, lung protective ventilation should not aim for a specific intrinsic PEEP or target certain tidal volumes. Instead, the goal is to minimize dynamic alveolar strain by adjusting ventilation to the individual lung´s mechanical characteristics. Unfortunately, so far, there is no clear definitions for APRV- settings and this circumstance impedes direct comparison of different studies. There is limited evidence of animal or human studies to support the titration of tidal volumes per kg of predicted body weight in APRV and lung protective ventilation in APRV should not target specific tidal volumes per predicted body weight. Despite the lack of clear recommendations regarding the setting of APRV- mode, some previous studies claimed a benefit of using APRV for recruitment of alveoli in cases of ARDS, where conventional modes of mechanical ventilation failed to improve gas exchange. Several animal studies could show an improvement of oxygenation in APRV by increasing ventilation in the dependent areas of the lung. Regarding human studies analyzing ARDS patients, APRV showed to improve PaO2/FiO2 ratio and was able to reduce FiO2 requirements. A meta- analysis by Carsetti et al. was able to reveal a reduction of ventilator- free days at day 28 in APRV- mode compared to conventional ventilator modes. Regarding the impact of APRV- mode on mortality of ARDS patients there is inconsistent evidence so far. Whereas Carsetti et al. and a study by Zhou et al. were able to show that APRV- mode was associated with a reduced mortality, most studies in the past only detected an improvement of oxygenation without any mortality benefit of APRV- mode. On the contrary, an Australian prospective, randomized, single center study by Zorbas et al. 2021 could even show a higher 90-day mortality and fewer ventilator-free days independent of the patients' severity of illness in APRV versus low tidal volume BIPAP.

### A comparison of bilevel and continuous positive airway pressure noninvasive ventilation in acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema [^c64670ff]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Whether bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) is advantageous compared with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPO) remains uncertain. The aim of the meta-analysis was to assess potential beneficial and adverse effects of CPAP compared with BiPAP in patients with ACPO.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials comparing the treatment effects of BiPAP with CPAP were identified from electronic databases and reference lists from January 1966 to December 2012. Two reviewers independently assessed study quality. In trials that fulfilled inclusion criteria, we critically evaluate the evidence for the use of noninvasive ventilation on rates of hospital mortality, endotracheal intubation, myocardial infarction, and the length of hospital stay. Data were combined using Review Manager 4.3 (The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). Both pooled effects and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.

Results

Twelve randomized controlled trials with a total of 1433 patients with ACPO were included. The hospital mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.86; 95% CI, 0.65–1.14; P = 0.46; I(2) = 0%) and need for requiring invasive ventilation (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.57–1.38; P = 0.64; I(2) = 0%) were not significantly different between patients treated with CPAP and those treated with BiPAP. The occurrence of new cases of myocardial infarction (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.77–1.17; P = 0.53, I(2) = 0%) and length of hospital stay (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, -0.40 to 2.41; P = 0.98; I(2) = 0%) were also not significantly different between the 2 groups.

Conclusions

There are no significant differences in clinical outcomes when comparing CPAP vs BiPAP. Based on the limited data available, our results suggest that there are no significant differences in clinical outcomes when comparing CPAP with BiPAP.

### When is enteral nutrition indicated? [^5d9de5ed]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) — the decision to start EN in adults requiring NIV should be multidisciplinary and made on a case-by-case basis, with careful consideration of the patient's overall medical and nutrition status; placement of an EN tube with a standard NIV mask will cause an additional air leak, and if the additional leak is unable to be compensated for, it is recommended to look into a mask with an adaptor or sealing pad; if choosing to enterally feed a patient who is on noninvasive ventilation, postpyloric placement would be preferred because of the likely increased aspiration risk.

### High-flow nasal cannulae for respiratory support in adult intensive care patients [^d038dc15]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

High-flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) deliver high flows of blended humidified air and oxygen via wide-bore nasal cannulae and may be useful in providing respiratory support for adult patients experiencing acute respiratory failure in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Objectives

We evaluated studies that included participants 16 years of age and older who were admitted to the ICU and required treatment with HFNC. We assessed the safety and efficacy of HFNC compared with comparator interventions in terms of treatment failure, mortality, adverse events, duration of respiratory support, hospital and ICU length of stay, respiratory effects, patient-reported outcomes, and costs of treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, Web of Science, proceedings from four conferences, and clinical trials registries; and we handsearched reference lists of relevant studies. We conducted searches from January 2000 to March 2016 and reran the searches in December 2016. We added four new studies of potential interest to a list of 'Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate them into formal review findings during the review update.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled studies with a parallel or cross-over design comparing HFNC use in adult ICU patients versus other forms of non-invasive respiratory support (low-flow oxygen via nasal cannulae or mask, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP)).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias.

Main Results

We included 11 studies with 1972 participants. Participants in six studies had respiratory failure, and in five studies required oxygen therapy after extubation. Ten studies compared HFNC versus low-flow oxygen devices; one of these also compared HFNC versus CPAP, and another compared HFNC versus BiPAP alone. Most studies reported randomization and allocation concealment inadequately and provided inconsistent details of outcome assessor blinding. We did not combine data for CPAP and BiPAP comparisons with data for low-flow oxygen devices; study data were insufficient for separate analysis of CPAP and BiPAP for most outcomes. For the primary outcomes of treatment failure (1066 participants; six studies) and mortality (755 participants; three studies), investigators found no differences between HFNC and low-flow oxygen therapies (risk ratio (RR), Mantel-Haenszel (MH), random-effects 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 1.27; and RR, MH, random-effects 0.63, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.06, respectively). We used the GRADE approach to downgrade the certainty of this evidence to low because of study risks of bias and different participant indications. Reported adverse events included nosocomial pneumonia, oxygen desaturation, visits to general practitioner for respiratory complications, pneumothorax, acute pseudo-obstruction, cardiac dysrhythmia, septic shock, and cardiorespiratory arrest. However, single studies reported adverse events, and we could not combine these findings; one study reported fewer episodes of oxygen desaturation with HFNC but no differences in all other reported adverse events. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for adverse events to low because of limited data. Researchers noted no differences in ICU length of stay (mean difference (MD), inverse variance (IV), random-effects 0.15, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.34; four studies; 770 participants), and we downgraded quality to low because of study risks of bias and different participant indications. We found no differences in oxygenation variables: partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) (MD, IV, random-effects 7.31, 95% CI -23.69 to 41.31; four studies; 510 participants); PaO 2 (MD, IV, random-effects 2.79, 95% CI -5.47 to 11.05; three studies; 355 participants); and oxygen saturation (SpO 2) up to 24 hours (MD, IV, random-effects 0.72, 95% CI -0.73 to 2.17; four studies; 512 participants). Data from two studies showed that oxygen saturation measured after 24 hours was improved among those treated with HFNC (MD, IV, random-effects 1.28, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.55; 445 participants), but this difference was small and was not clinically significant. Along with concern about risks of bias and differences in participant indications, review authors noted a high level of unexplained statistical heterogeneity in oxygenation effect estimates, and we downgraded the quality of evidence to very low. Meta-analysis of three comparable studies showed no differences in carbon dioxide clearance among those treated with HFNC (MD, IV, random-effects -0.75, 95% CI -2.04 to 0.55; three studies; 590 participants). Two studies reported no differences in atelectasis; we did not combine these findings. Data from six studies (867 participants) comparing HFNC versus low-flow oxygen showed no differences in respiratory rates up to 24 hours according to type of oxygen delivery device (MD, IV, random-effects -1.51, 95% CI -3.36 to 0.35), and no difference after 24 hours (MD, IV, random-effects -2.71, 95% CI -7.12 to 1.70; two studies; 445 participants). Improvement in respiratory rates when HFNC was compared with CPAP or BiPAP was not clinically important (MD, IV, random-effects -0.89, 95% CI -1.74 to -0.05; two studies; 834 participants). Results showed no differences in patient-reported measures of comfort according to oxygen delivery devices in the short term (MD, IV, random-effects 0.14, 95% CI -0.65 to 0.93; three studies; 462 participants) and in the long term (MD, IV, random-effects -0.36, 95% CI -3.70 to 2.98; two studies; 445 participants); we downgraded the certainty of this evidence to low. Six studies measured dyspnoea on incomparable scales, yielding inconsistent study data. No study in this review provided data on positive end-expiratory pressure measured at the pharyngeal level, work of breathing, or cost comparisons of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

We were unable to demonstrate whether HFNC was a more effective or safe oxygen delivery device compared with other oxygenation devices in adult ICU patients. Meta-analysis could be performed for few studies for each outcome, and data for comparisons with CPAP or BiPAP were very limited. In addition, we identified some risks of bias among included studies, differences in patient groups, and high levels of statistical heterogeneity for some outcomes, leading to uncertainty regarding the results of our analysis. Consequently, evidence is insufficient to show whether HFNC provides safe and efficacious respiratory support for adult ICU patients.

### Evidence-based guideline for prehospital airway management [^49435f28]. Prehospital Emergency Care (2024). High credibility.

CPAP/BiPAP continuation and discontinuation in prehospital care — once CPAP/BiPAP is initiated, breaking the mask seal may cause significant decrease in airway pressures and lead to abrupt decompensation due to atelectasis and alveolar collapse, and meticulous attention should be paid to maintaining mask seal unless hospital CPAP/BiPAP is immediately available for the patient to be switched over. In general, patients initiated on prehospital CPAP/BiPAP should remain on NIPPV, and discontinuation should only occur under the following settings: patients who demonstrate significant improvement, discontinuation may occur under either physician consultation or an established process, or if the patient deteriorates on CPAP/BiPAP (e.g., worsened mental status, increasing EtCO2, vomiting), discontinue CPAP/BiPAP and escalate airway management options as appropriate.

### Airway pressure release ventilation and biphasic positive airway pressure: a systematic review of definitional criteria [^49789a0c]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to identify the definitional criteria for the pressure-limited and time-cycled modes: airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) and biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) available in the published literature.

Design

Systematic review.

Methods

Medline, PubMed, Cochrane, and CINAHL databases (1982–2006) were searched using the following terms: APRV, BIPAP, Bilevel and lung protective strategy, individually and in combination. Two independent reviewers determined the paper eligibility and abstracted data from 50 studies and 18 discussion articles.

Measurements and Results

Of the 50 studies, 39 (78%) described APRV, and 11 (22%) described BIPAP. Various study designs, populations, or outcome measures were investigated. Compared to BIPAP, APRV was described more frequently as extreme inverse inspiratory:expiratory ratio [18/39 (46%) vs. 0/11 (0%), P = 0.004] and used rarely as a noninverse ratio [2/39 (5%) vs. 3/11 (27%), P = 0.06]. One (9%) BIPAP and eight (21%) APRV studies used mild inverse ratio (> 1:1 to ≤ 2:1) (P = 0.7), plus there was increased use of 1:1 ratio [7 (64%) vs. 12 (31%), P = 0.08] with BIPAP. In adult studies, the mean reported set inspiratory pressure (PHigh) was 6 cm H2O greater with APRV when compared to reports of BIPAP (P = 0.3). For both modes, the mean reported positive end expiratory pressure (PLow) was 5.5 cm H2O. Thematic review identified inconsistency of mode descriptions.

Conclusions

Ambiguity exists in the criteria that distinguish APRV and BIPAP. Commercial ventilator branding may further add to confusion. Generic naming of modes and consistent definitional parameters may improve consistency of patient response for a given mode and assist with clinical implementation.

### Noninvasive mechanical ventilation with average volume assured pressure support (AVAPS) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypercapnic encephalopathy [^1fab462d]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with the acute decompensation of COPD, accompanied by an altered mental status require rapid correction of alveolar hypoventilation which ensure an adequate tidal volume (minute volume) (volume settings between 8–12 ml/kg/weight) for rapid dissemination or carbon monoxide swept cerebrospinal fluid and brain and its sensory recovery as early as possible.

Studies examining the use of NIV in hypercapnic encephalopathy indicate that various ventilatory modes can be employed at different pressure levels. Gonzales et al used BiPAP vision or BiPAP ST-D 30, in which IPAP levels were initially programmed at 12 cmH 2 O and increased every 4 hours with an IPAP value in the first hour of 17 + 2 cmH 2 O. In our study, patients on BiPAP S/T with AVAPS had an initial IPAP of 19.82, vs 12.36 in the control group. BiPAP S/T with AVAPS achieves the necessary inspiratory pressure level for a predetermined tidal volume, ensuring optimal pressure for the patient and facilitating a suitable inspiratory volume; this also rapidly overcomes alveolar hypoventilation, corrects pCO 2 levels, and decreases CO 2 levels in the brain so as to improve the patient's level of consciousness. Battisti et al. compared manually adjusted pressures with self-adjusting pressure support in patients with acute respiratory failure, which produced a decrease in pCO 2 levels in the latter group.

### A comparison of continuous and bi-level positive airway pressure non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema: a meta-analysis [^716a6906]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

We conducted the present study to investigate the potential beneficial and adverse effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compared with bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) noninvasive ventilation in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema.

Method

We included randomized controlled studies comparing CPAP and BiPAP treatment in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema from the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2005 issue 3), and EMBASE and MEDLINE databases (1966 to 1 December 2005), without language restriction. Two reviewers reviewed the quality of the studies and independently performed data extraction.

Results

Seven randomized controlled studies, including a total of 290 patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, were considered. The hospital mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32–1.78; P = 0.52; I² = 0%) and risk for requiring invasive ventilation (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.33–1.94; P = 0.62; I² = 0%) were not significantly different between patients treated with CPAP and those treated with BiPAP. Stratifying studies that used either fixed or titrated pressure during BiPAP treatment and studies involving patients with or without hypercapnia did not change the results. The duration of noninvasive ventilation required until the pulmonary oedema resolved (weighted mean difference [WMD] in hours = 3.65, 95% CI -12.12 to +19.43; P = 0.65, I² = 0%) and length of hospital stay (WMD in days = -0.04, 95% CI -2.57 to +2.48; P = 0.97, I² = 0%) were also not significantly different between the two groups. Based on the limited data available, there was an insignificant trend toward an increase in new onset acute myocardial infarction in patients treated with BiPAP (RR 2.10, 95% CI 0.91–4.84; P = 0.08; I² = 25.3%).

Conclusion

BiPAP does not offer any significant clinical benefits over CPAP in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Until a large randomized controlled trial shows significant clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of BiPAP versus CPAP in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, the choice of modality will depend mainly on the equipment available.

### Comparison of airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) versus biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) ventilation in COVID-19 associated ARDS using transpulmonary pressure monitoring [^a482b851]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Transpulmonary pressure

As measured transpulmonary pressures were not normally distributed, we compared medians and Interquartile range (IQR) of TPP in APRV vs. BIPAP: There was a significant difference in median endexpiratory TPP in APRV vs. BIPAP. In contrast to BIPAP, in APRV-mode median endexpiratory TPP was lower and negative (-1.2mbar; IQR − 4.88/4.53) vs. positive (3.45mbar; IQR 1.95 / 8.57; p < .01) in BIPAP (see Figs. 1 and 2; Table 5 in the supplement). Furthermore, median transpulmonary driving pressure was significantly higher in APRV (p < .01; see Table 5 in the supplement) vs. BIPAP. In contrast, mean PEEP, plateau-, peak, and driving pressure did not differ in both modes (see Table 5 in the supplement). Moreover, there was no difference in median endinspiratory TPP (10.02mbar; IQR 6.5/14.25 in APRV vs. 10.67mbar; IQR 6.08 / 15.5; p = .85) and median elastance-derived endinspiratory TPP (ED-TPP endinspiratory) in APRV vs. BIPAP (p = .09 see Fig. 1 / Table 5 in the supplement). Median endinspiratory TPP was < 20mbar in both modes.

### High-flow nasal oxygen vs noninvasive positive airway pressure in hypoxemic patients after cardiothoracic surgery: a randomized clinical trial [^482c8dc8]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Noninvasive ventilation delivered as bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) is often used to avoid reintubation and improve outcomes of patients with hypoxemia after cardiothoracic surgery. High-flow nasal oxygen therapy is increasingly used to improve oxygenation because of its ease of implementation, tolerance, and clinical effectiveness.

Objective

To determine whether high-flow nasal oxygen therapy was not inferior to BiPAP for preventing or resolving acute respiratory failure after cardiothoracic surgery.

Design and Setting

Multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial (BiPOP Study) conducted between June 15, 2011, and January 15, 2014, at 6 French intensive care units.

Participants

A total of 830 patients who had undergone cardiothoracic surgery, of which coronary artery bypass, valvular repair, and pulmonary thromboendarterectomy were the most common, were included when they developed acute respiratory failure (failure of a spontaneous breathing trial or successful breathing trial but failed extubation) or were deemed at risk for respiratory failure after extubation due to preexisting risk factors.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive high-flow nasal oxygen therapy delivered continuously through a nasal cannula (flow, 50 L/min; fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2], 50%) (n = 414) or BiPAP delivered with a full-face mask for at least 4 hours per day (pressure support level, 8 cm H2O; positive end-expiratory pressure, 4 cm H2O; FiO2, 50%) (n = 416).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as reintubation, switch to the other study treatment, or premature treatment discontinuation (patient request or adverse effects, including gastric distention). Noninferiority of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy would be demonstrated if the lower boundary of the 95% CI were less than 9%. Secondary outcomes included mortality during intensive care unit stay, changes in respiratory variables, and respiratory complications.

Results

High-flow nasal oxygen therapy was not inferior to BiPAP: the treatment failed in 87 of 414 patients with high-flow nasal oxygen therapy (21.0%) and 91 of 416 patients with BiPAP (21.9%) (absolute difference, 0.9%; 95% CI, -4.9% to 6.6%; P = 0.003). No significant differences were found for intensive care unit mortality (23 patients with BiPAP [5.5%] and 28 with high-flow nasal oxygen therapy [6.8%]; P = 0.66) (absolute difference, 1.2% [95% CI, -2.3% to 4.8%]. Skin breakdown was significantly more common with BiPAP after 24 hours (10% vs 3%; 95% CI, 7.3%-13.4% vs 1.8%-5.6%; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among cardiothoracic surgery patients with or at risk for respiratory failure, the use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy compared with intermittent BiPAP did not result in a worse rate of treatment failure. The findings support the use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy in similar patients.

### A prospective, randomized trial of BiPAP in severe acute congestive heart failure [^a6d80019]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation has been found to be efficacious in the setting of acute respiratory failure, specifically in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations. Its use in congestive heart failure (CHF) is less well established. Additionally, it has been reported that there is an increase in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) rate with the use of bilevel positive pressure ventilation (BiPAP) in CHF patients. This study examined whether BiPAP decreases the intubation rate or improves cardiopulmonary parameters in severe CHF patients compared to high flow O(2) by mask (MASK), and whether there is an increase in AMI rate with the use of BiPAP. A prospective, randomized clinical trial at a county hospital teaching Emergency Department was conducted by enrolling 38 patients who were in severe CHF. Patients were randomized to receive either BiPAP or MASK in addition to adjunct therapy. Age and gender were not different between the groups. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry all showed no significant difference in change over time between groups, but there was a significant change over time within groups. Arterial pH, pCO(2), and pO(2) also showed no significant difference in change over time between groups, but there was a significant change over time within groups. The intubation rate for BiPAP was 23.8% (5) vs. MASK at 41.2% (7). The AMI rate was 19% (4) in the BiPAP group and 29.4% (5) in the MASK group. No true differences were detected between groups for increased oxygenation or a reduction in intubation rate. An increase in AMI rate with BiPAP was not found in this study as previously reported. This study provides support for a larger clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of BiPAP in acute CHF.

### Effect of average volume-assured pressure support treatment on health-related quality of life in COPD patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure: a randomized trial [^f7b9972b]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The long-term effect of average volume-assured pressure support (AVAPS) on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure (CHRF) remains unclear. The objective of this study is to identify the long-term effect of AVAPS in COPD patients with CHRF through assessment of HRQOL, exercise tolerance after six months duration.

Methods

In this randomized, controlled, parallel-group study, 40 stable hypercapnic COPD patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either spontaneous timed AVAPS (ST/AVAPS) (intervention) or Bilevel positive airway pressure (ST/BiPAP) (control). HRQL was measured with the Short Form 12 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-12). Exercise tolerance assessed by 6min walking distance. Analyses were done between groups from baseline to the average of six months measurements.

Results

AVAPS led to significant 6months improvements in several domains of (SF-12) compared to the control group, with the greatest improvement seen in general health [treatment effect of 8.2 points (95% confidence interval [95% CI 3.2 to 11.7; p = 0.001)], vitality (treatment effect 5.4 points [95% CI 1.4 to 9.3]; p = 0.001), physical functioning 5.5 points [95% CI 1.1 to 9.8]; p = 0.001) and bodily pain 5.1 points [95% CI 3.4 to 8.8]; p = 0.002). The physical health summary score improved by 3.7 points (95% CI 1.2 to 5.8; p = 0.001), but no significant improvement in the emotional or social role functioning, mental health subscale was noted. AVAPS also resulted in improvement 6min walking distance 9.2 points (95% CI -1 to -15]; p = 0.001). A significant reduction in the daytime (PaCO2) was observed after 6months in those treated with AVAPS.

Conclusions

In COPD patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure, AVAPS improved exercise tolerance and multiple domains of HRQOL over six months of follow-up, with the significant improvement observed in general health.

### Comparison of airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) versus biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) ventilation in COVID-19 associated ARDS using transpulmonary pressure monitoring [^170a0c77]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ventilator parameters

All subjects included in this study were ventilated in BIPAP-mode initially. The mean ventilation time in BIPAP- mode was 478.58 ± 334.99 vs. 5.4 ± 1.12 h in APRV- mode.

Given the severity of CARDS spontaneous breathing was suppressed by sedation in all study subjects. The mean number of days before a trial of APRV was initiated was 3.05 ± 2.31 days after ICU admission as per decision of the treating physician and also terminated by the treating physician e.g. in case of hemodynamic instability or failure to improve gas exchange with this "rescue mode". All patients transferred to APRV- mode suffered from ARDS as per Berlin classification (PaO2/ FiO2 < 300mmHg). In APRV- mode, mean tidal volume per predicted body weight, mean airway pressure and intrinsic PEEP were significantly higher compared to BIPAP. Vice versa, mean respiratory rate was significantly lower in APRV than in BIPAP as was mean set (extrinsic) PEEP. There was no difference in mean total PEEP (intrinsic PEEP plus extrinsic PEEP), peak-, plateau or driving- pressure (calculated by the difference of plateau pressure minus extrinsic PEEP and intrinsic PEEP) in APRV vs. BIPAP. Also, no difference could be found regarding the mechanical power, the compliance or resistance of the patients' lungs in comparing both modes. All ventilator parameters are given in Table 5 in the supplement.

### Comparison of airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) versus biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) ventilation in COVID-19 associated ARDS using transpulmonary pressure monitoring [^a14d5ff1]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, our study also has certain strengths. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis comparing APRV vs. BIPAP using TPP monitoring in CARDS patients in a clinical setting. Further, as our intensive care unit was focused on the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients at the above-mentioned time-period, therapy was highly standardized within a well-educated team. Thus, despite being a retrospective study, the level of standardization may be assumed to be extremely homogenous.

Implications

Regarding implications, APRV seems to have many theory-based advantages in ARDS, but evidence of large, randomized multicenter trials comparing APRV to other modes of ventilation for CARDS patients are lacking so far. APRV is highly dependent on adjusting ventilator settings individually to the patients' needs. Inadequate ventilator settings carry a high risk of unwitnessed derecruitment or volu- and barotrauma of the lung leading to VILI.

### Comparison of airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) versus biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) ventilation in COVID-19 associated ARDS using transpulmonary pressure monitoring [^5b431ffa]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

During the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, many Intensive Care patients presented with Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID 19)-associated-ARDS (CARDS). Though fulfilling the Berlin definition, CARDS differs from ARDS of other pathophysiology. Patients suffering from CARDS often show signs of severe hypoxia requiring mechanical ventilation. Mortality of CARDS remains high and ventilator-associated lung injury (VILI) might be a major contributor.

Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) has been used as a "rescue mode" of ventilation in managing patients with ARDS of other origin in the past to improve oxygenation and to keep the lung open (open lung concept) more consistently and more homogeneously. APRV and other modes of biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) represent a pressure targeted intermittent mandatory ventilation ranging biphasically between an upper and lower pressure level. But in contrast to BIPAP, APRV delivers continuous positive pressure (P high) for a preset of prolonged inspiratory time (T high) with intermittent releases to a lower pressure level (P low) at a preset of a shortened expiratory time (T low). This shortened expiratory time in APRV is supposed to create an intrinsic PEEP which ideally avoids cyclic derecruitment and reduces cyclical opening and collapse of lungs. But unfortunately, in APRV intrinsic PEEP and driving pressure can be difficult to measure and may be unreliable predictors of atelectasis.

Moreover, as prolonged inspiratory times resulting in increased mean airway pressures, are characteristic for APRV, this mode is supposed to establish alveolar recruitment, improvement of lung compliance and optimization of ventilation in relation to alveolar perfusion. Vice versa, other studies highlight the potential risk of baro- or volutrauma in APRV. This might especially be problematic in CARDS, a typically heterogenous lung disease.

Unfortunately, conventional ventilator monitoring is an insufficient detector for the risk of VILI. Transpulmonary pressure (TPP) could be a useful tool to detect an increased risk for baro-, volu- and atelectrauma in mechanically ventilated patients. So far, there is little knowledge about the risk of VILI in APRV vs. BIPAP in CARDS. Therefore, this study aimed to assess whether there are differences regarding the risk of volu-, baro- and atelectrauma in patients suffering from CARDS comparing ventilation in APRV- vs. BIPAP- mode by monitoring endinspiratory and endexpiratory TPP.

### A comparison of continuous and bi-level positive airway pressure non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema: a meta-analysis [^238f735b]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

The duration of noninvasive ventilation needed until pulmonary oedema resolved (WMD in hours = 3.65, 95% CI -12.12 to +19.43; P = 0.65; I² = 0%) and the length of hospital stay (WMD in days = -0.04, 95% CI -2.57 to +2.48; P = 0.97; I² = 0%) were not significantly different between the two groups (Figures 4 and 5). Data on patients with new onset acute myocardial infarction after initiation of CPAP or BiPAP were limited and with some inconsistencies. Based on these limited data, there was an insignificant trend toward an increase in new onset myocardial infarction in patients treated with the BiPAP (RR 2.10, 95% CI 0.91–4.84; P = 0.08; I² = 25.3%; Figure 6). None of the studies included a cost-effectiveness analysis.

### A comparison of continuous and bi-level positive airway pressure non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema: a meta-analysis [^223fb0bc]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses

The differences in categorical outcomes between the treatment and placebo group were reported as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), using a random effect model. The effects of CPAP or BiPAP on the hospital mortality and the need for invasive ventilation were further stratified into studies using either a fixed level or variable levels of airway pressure during BiPAP treatment, and this interaction was tested by relative risk ratio. The differences in the duration of noninvasive ventilation required until the pulmonary oedema resolved and the length of hospital stay were reported as weighted mean differences (WMDs), using a random effect model. The presence of heterogeneity between trials was assessed using the χ 2 statistics and the extent of inconsistency was assessed using I 2 statistics. Because hypercapnia is a predictor of requiring intubation in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, sensitivity analysis was conducted to include studies that involved patients with hypercapnia (mean PaCO 2 > 45 mmHg) before initiation of either CPAP or BiPAP. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plot using hospital mortality as an end-point.

### Biphasic positive airway pressure ventilation (PeV +) in children [^e3afe53b]. Critical Care (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) (also known as PeV+) is a mode of ventilation with cycling variations between two continuous positive airway pressure levels. In adults this mode of ventilation is effective and is being accepted with a decrease in need for sedatives because of the ability to breathe spontaneously during the entire breathing cycle. We studied the use of BIPAP in infants and children.

Methods

We randomized 18 patients with respiratory failure for ventilation with either BIPAP (n = 11) or assisted spontaneous breathing (ASB) (n = 7) on Evita 4. Lorazepam and, if necessary, morphine were used as sedatives and adjusted in accordance with the Comfort scale. We compared number of randomized mode failure, duration and complications of ventilation and number and dosages of sedatives administered.

Results

No differences in patient characteristics, ventilatory parameters, complications of ventilation or use of sedatives were noted. Ten out of eleven patients that we intended to ventilate with BIPAP were successfully ventilated with BIPAP. Four out of seven patients that we intended to ventilate with ASB could not be ventilated adequately with ASB but were successfully crossed over to BIPAP without the need for further sedatives.

Conclusions

BIPAP is an effective, safe and easy to use mode of ventilation in infants and children.

### Treatment of adult obstructive sleep apnea with positive airway pressure: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^3cebad98]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2019). High credibility.

PAP modalities — Recommendation 6 states: We suggest that clinicians use CPAP or APAP over BIPAP in the routine treatment of OSA in adults. (CONDITIONAL). Remarks clarify that this recommendation is based on BPAP defined as a respiratory assist device that delivers inspiratory and expiratory positive airway pressure and applies to all BPAP devices including flexible, modified, and auto-adjusting BPAP; BPAP devices may need to be used for patients with higher therapeutic pressure requirements than can be provided by CPAP or APAP devices; this recommendation is for the initial treatment of OSA and does not address management of patients who have previously failed CPAP or APAP, and treatment of other forms of sleep-related breathing disorders associated with hypercapnia, which may require the use of BPAP, are covered in other AASM guidelines. Evidence reviewed included that the TF examined BPAP versus CPAP for adherence, sleepiness, and QOL, the TF identified 5 RCTs that compared the use of BPAP to CPAP, meta-analyses demonstrated no clinically significant differences in adherence, and, while no direct evidence was available for APAP to BPAP, the TF considers APAP to be equivalent to CPAP for the implementation of this recommendation.

### A clinical guide to non-invasive respiratory support in acute respiratory failure: ventilation settings, technical optimization and clinical indications [^6bbddd12]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

If BiPAP is performed using a standard helmet interface (e.g. the same helmet used for CPAP), the large internal volume and the high compliant helmet can lead to delayed pressurization and reduced inspiratory pressure, resulting in patient-ventilator asynchrony.

It should be noted that patient-ventilator asynchronies does not always lead to discomfort with helmet BiPAP, as long the patient is able to inhale and exhale in the reservoir of the interface. Additionally, inspiratory de-synchronization may have lung-protective effects, as inspiratory effort and the delivery of pressure support are in part out of phase, limiting the amplitude of transpulmonary pressure swings.

To optimize NIV performance by balancing patient-ventilator synchrony, lung protection, respiratory muscle unloading, and CO₂ clearance, specific ventilator settings should be adjusted. These include applying a higher PEEP (e.g.about 10-12cmH 2 O) to stiffen the helmet, titrating the pressure support level (e.g. about 10-14cmH 2 O) to obtain peak inspiratory flow of 80–100 L/min (HENIVOT2 trial, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05089695), and using a short pressurization time (e.g.0 Sects.). However, a recent study reported that H-BiPAP was less effective than facemask BiPAP in reducing dyspnoea in COPD patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure, suggesting that, despite design and setting optimization, a considerable amount of asynchrony remains, likely affecting patient's perception. CO 2 rebreathing may be a concern during H-BiPAP, as the helmet's internal volume is much larger (approximately 18 L) than that of facemask. The average CO 2 concentration within the helmet depends on CO 2 production and total helmet ventilation, that can be monitored on the ventilator, unlike patient minute ventilation. Using a two-limb circuit with two independent helmet ports or a single-limb circuit with a modified expiratory valve placed on the helmet's expiratory port (e.g.open circuit) improve CO 2 washout compared to a standard double-limb ventilator circuit connected to the helmet via a Y-piece. Furthermore, a pressure support of 12cmH 2 O typically prevents clinically relevant CO 2 rebreathing during H-BiPAP ensuring sufficient flow through the helmet.

### Prehospital noninvasive ventilation for acute respiratory failure: systematic review, network meta-analysis, and individual patient data meta-analysis [^05d07a6a]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

This meta-analysis aimed to determine the effectiveness of prehospital continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel inspiratory positive airway pressure (BiPAP) in acute respiratory failure.

Methods

Fourteen electronic databases and research registers were searched from inception to August 2013. Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials that reported mortality or intubation rate for prehospital CPAP or BiPAP were selected and compared to a relevant comparator in patients with acute respiratory failure. An aggregate data network meta-analysis was used to jointly estimate intervention effects relative to standard care. A network meta-analysis using a mixture of individual patient-level data and aggregate data was carried out to assess potential treatment effect modifiers.

Results

Eight randomized and two quasi-randomized controlled trials (six CPAP, four BiPAP, sample sizes 23 to 207) were identified. The aggregate data network meta-analysis suggested that CPAP was the most effective treatment in terms of mortality (probability = 0.989) and intubation rate (probability = 0.639) and reduced both mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 0.41; 95% credible interval [CrI] = 0.20 to 0.77) and intubation rate (OR = 0.32; 95% CrI = 0.17 to 0.62), compared to standard care. The effect of BiPAP on mortality (OR = 1.94; 95% CrI = 0.65 to 6.14) and intubation rate (OR = 0.40; 95% CrI = 0.14 to 1.16) was uncertain. The network meta-analysis using individual patient-level data and aggregate data suggested that sex was a modifier of the effect of treatment on mortality.

Conclusions

Prehospital CPAP can reduce mortality and intubation rates compared to standard care, while the effectiveness of prehospital BiPAP is uncertain.

### A clinical guide to non-invasive respiratory support in acute respiratory failure: ventilation settings, technical optimization and clinical indications [^9d8c1ee0]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic pulmonary edema

In the context of CPE, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) support the application of NIV (CPAP or BiPAP) to improve clinical outcomes (e.g. reduced need for endotracheal intubation, lower in-hospital mortality). NIV, in addition to pharmacologic interventions, is recommended as first-line therapy for patients with CPE without acute cardiogenic shock or need for revascularization therapy. In CPE, no NIV modality or interface has been shown to be superior; therefore, the choice should prioritize minimizing leaks, ensuring CO 2 clearance, and optimizing patient tolerance. Even in patients with acidotic CPE, both CPAP and BiPAP reduced hypercapnia, acidosis and heart rate compared to COT (Table S1). Although the first RCT comparing CPAP and BiPAP raised concerns about a potential increased risk of acute myocardial infarction with BiPAP, several more recent trials have not confirmed this association.

In CPE patients, HFNT reduces respiratory rate more than COT and is non-inferior to face mask BiPAP for endotracheal intubation or death within 7 days. However, H-CPAP resulted in a greater short-term respiratory and hemodynamic improvement compared to HFNT. Therefore, HFNT may be beneficial for patients requiring prolonged support or those who do not tolerate CPAP or BiPAP.

Due to its simplicity, immediate efficacy, good tolerance and safety, CPAP, delivered via facemask, is feasible option in pre-hospital care, where it can be applied by minimally trained personnel. In the context of out-of-hospital CPE, CPAP, delivered via both facemask or helmet, has been shown to provide beneficial effects on respiratory and cardiac function.

### Association of extubation failure rates with high-flow nasal cannula, continuous positive airway pressure, and bilevel positive airway pressure vs conventional oxygen therapy in infants and young children: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^fff4d4f2]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Extubation failure (EF) has been associated with worse outcomes in critically ill children. The relative efficacy of different modes of noninvasive respiratory support (NRS) to prevent EF is unknown.

Objective

To study the reported relative efficacy of different modes of NRS (high-flow nasal cannula [HFNC], continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP], and bilevel positive airway pressure [BiPAP]) compared to conventional oxygen therapy (COT).

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL Complete through May 2022.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials that enrolled critically ill children receiving invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours and compared the efficacy of different modes of postextubation NRS.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Random-effects models were fit using a bayesian network meta-analysis framework. Between-group comparisons were estimated using odds ratios (ORs) or mean differences with 95% credible intervals (CrIs). Treatment rankings were assessed by rank probabilities and the surface under the cumulative rank curve (SUCRA).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was EF (reintubation within 48 to 72 hours). Secondary outcomes were treatment failure (TF, reintubation plus NRS escalation or crossover to another NRS mode), pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) mortality, PICU and hospital length of stay, abdominal distension, and nasal injury.

Results

A total of 11 615 citations were screened, and 9 randomized clinical trials with a total of 1421 participants were included. Both CPAP and HFNC were found to be more effective than COT in reducing EF and TF (CPAP: OR for EF, 0.43; 95% CrI, 0.17–1.0 and OR for TF 0.27, 95% CrI 0.11–0.57 and HFNC: OR for EF, 0.64; 95% CrI, 0.24–1.0 and OR for TF, 0.34; 95% CrI, 0.16–0.65). CPAP had the highest likelihood of being the best intervention for both EF (SUCRA, 0.83) and TF (SUCRA, 0.91). Although not statistically significant, BiPAP was likely to be better than COT for preventing both EF and TF. Compared to COT, CPAP and BiPAP were reported as showing a modest increase (approximately 3%) in nasal injury and abdominal distension.

Conclusions and Relevance

The studies included in this systematic review and network meta-analysis found that compared with COT, EF and TF rates were lower with modest increases in abdominal distension and nasal injury. Of the modes evaluated, CPAP was associated with the lowest rates of EF and TF.

### A clinical guide to non-invasive respiratory support in acute respiratory failure: ventilation settings, technical optimization and clinical indications [^b6268774]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Prophylactic non-invasive respiratory support after extubation

In ICU, non-invasive respiratory support is often applied immediately after extubation to preserve the benefits of mechanical ventilation, such as lung recruitment and respiratory muscle unloading, while reducing the risk of respiratory failure and reintubation. In patients at high risk of extubation failure (e.g. mechanical ventilation for more than 24 h, age > 65 years, presence of comorbidities) BiPAP is recognized as an efficient strategy to reduce the risk of reintubation.

In this population, Hernández et al. reported that HFNT was non-inferior to BiPAP in preventing reintubation and post-extubation respiratory failure. However, more recent trials showed a lower reintubation rate when BiPAP was used instead of HFNT, or when it was combined with HFNT, compared to HFNT alone (Table S4). These evidences were further confirmed by recent meta-analysis. In patients with obesity, the application of positive pressure after extubation helps maintain end-expiratory lung volume and prevent upper airway collapse. A post-hoc analysis of a multicenter RCT suggests prophylactic BiPAP alternating with HFNT may decrease the risk of reintubation and mortality versus HFNT alone.

In low-risk patients without the previously described risk factors for extubation failure, HFNT has been compared with COT, but findings have been inconsistent.

Current guidelines suggest NIV over HFNT for patients at high risk of extubation failure after ≥ 24 h of mechanical ventilation; in lower-risk patients, HFNT is suggested over COT, although the evidence level is low. NIV should be applied for prolonged periods within the first 24–48 h following extubation (i.e.for at least 12 h within the first 24 h), and tolerance should be optimized through careful interface selection, device rotation, active humidification, and appropriate NIV setting.

### Comparison of airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) versus biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) ventilation in COVID-19 associated ARDS using transpulmonary pressure monitoring [^6d0f2b34]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

APRV has been used for ARDS in the past. Little is known about the risk of ventilator- induced lung- injury (VILI) in APRV vs. BIPAP in the management of in COVID19-associated ARDS (CARDS). This study aimed to compare transpulmonary pressures (TPP) in APRV vs. BIPAP in CARDS in regard to lung protective ventilator settings.

Methods

This retrospective, monocentric cohort study (ethical approval: 21–1553) assessed all adult ICU- patients with CARDS who were ventilated with BIPAP vs. APRV and monitored with TPP from 03/2020 to 10/2021. Ventilator-settings / -pressures, TPP, hemodynamic and arterial blood gas parameters were compared in both modes.

Results

20 non- spontaneously breathing patients could be included in the study: Median TPPendexpiratory was lower / negative in APRV (-1.20mbar; IQR − 4.88 / +4.53) vs. positive in BIPAP (+ 3.4mbar; IQR + 1.95 / +8.57; p < .01). Median TPPendinspiratory did not differ. In APRV, mean tidal- volume per body- weight (7.05 ± 1.28 vs. 5.03 ± 0.77 ml; p < .01) and mean airway- pressure (27.08 ± 1.67 vs. 22.68 ± 2.62mbar; p < .01) were higher. There was no difference in PEEP, peak-, plateau- or driving- pressure, compliance, oxygenation and CO 2 - removal between both modes.

Conclusion

Despite higher tidal- volumes / airway-pressures in APRV vs. BIPAP, TPPendinspirator y was not increased. However, in APRV median TPPendexpiratory was negative indicating an elevated risk of occult atelectasis in APRV- mode in CARDS. Therefore, TPP- monitoring could be a useful tool for monitoring a safe application of APRV- mode in CARDS.

### A comparison of continuous and bi-level positive airway pressure non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema: a meta-analysis [^afb7ab73]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Results

We identified 17 potentially eligible studies, of which seven studies, including a total of 290 patients, fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were subjected to meta-analysis (Figure 1). Two studies used fixed level of CPAP (10 cmH 2 O) and BiPAP (15 and 5 cmH 2 O), two studies used a fixed level of CPAP (10 cmH 2 O) but titrated the level of peak inspiratory pressure in the BiPAP group (from 15 cmH 2 O to achieve a tidal volume of 400 ml), and three studies titrated the level of both CPAP (5–20 cmH 2 O) and BiPAP (peak inspiratory pressure range: 10–25 cmH 2 O). Four studies recruited patients who presented with hypercapnia (mean PaCO 2 > 45 mmHg). The mean age of the patients ranged from 61 to 77 years and the mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores ranged from 17 to 20 in the pooled studies. The Jadad scale scores of the studies ranged from 2 to 5 (mean 3). Allocation concealment was clearly adequate in four studies but only one study used double blinding. The study details are described in Table 1.

There was good overall consistency in most of the results, without significant heterogeneity. Hospital mortality (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.32–1.78; P = 0.52; I² = 0%) and the risk for requiring invasive ventilation (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.33–1.94; P = 0.62; I² = 0%) were not significantly different between patients treated with CPAP and those treated with BiPAP (Figures 2 and 3). Stratifying studies into use of BiPAP at variable or fixed level of airway pressure did not change the results. The relative risk ratios for hospital mortality and requiring invasive ventilation between studies using BiPAP at a fixed level and studies titrating the pressure were 3.38 (95% CI 0.30–37.60; P = 0.32) and 1.26 (95% CI 0.15–10.94; P = 0.83), respectively. Sensitivity analysis including studies that involved patients with significant hypercapnia did not change the results.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). High credibility.

Heart failure clinical data standards — mechanical ventilatory support is defined as mechanical ventilation, or assisted ventilation, used for artificial ventilation where mechanical means assist or replace spontaneous breathing, with permissible values of Mechanical ventilation, CPAP, BiPAP, Adaptive servo-ventilation, and None. Mechanical ventilation is described as a life-sustaining technique moving gas toward and from the lungs via an external device connected directly to the patient. CPAP is described as continuous positive airway pressure/power applying mild air pressure on a continuous basis to keep airways continuously open in patients who can breathe spontaneously but need help keeping their airway unobstructed. BiPAP is described as a noninvasive therapy in which positive air pressure is higher during inspiration and lower during expiration. Adaptive servo-ventilation is positive airway pressure therapy in which the air pressure target is adjusted to the patient's breathing patterns; in patients with NYHA class II–IV HFrEF and central sleep apnea, adaptive servo-ventilation causes harm.

### Biphasic positive airway pressure spontaneous breathing attenuates lung injury in an animal model of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome [^d3b1a06e]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In an experimental model of the early stage of severe ARDS, our study showed that BIPAP ventilation with SB effectively improved gas exchange. Compared with muscle relaxation, BIPAP SB effectively reduced the pathological injury of lung tissue. To better control the experimental conditions, we chose oleic acid to establish the ARDS model. The model has similarities regarding the basic clinical features of ARDS patients. There are many methods of mechanical ventilation for ARDS, and the reasons why we choose the BIPAP ventilation mode are as follows: First, the BIPAP ventilation mode is different from the A/C-V mode in that it is an unassisted SB ventilation mode, which can occur at any stage of the mechanical ventilation cycle and is only related to the respiratory drive of the experimental animals themselves, The main feature of BIPAP is that SB can be allowed during any phase of the mechanical cycle, so it is easy to maintain comparable levels of ventilator support between BIPAP with SB and without SB. Second, studies have shown that pressure is the main factor of VILI, and the BIPAP ventilation mode easily adjusts the ventilation parameters to make the average airway pressure of each experimental group consistent so that the experiment is comparable.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^0b16d426]. Neonatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Using a flow driver to generate CPAP has the theoretical advantage of offloading expiratory work of breathing, although no important clinical differences have been shown in clinical trials among various CPAP devices. The simplicity of bubble CPAP systems allows their use in low-income settings with some evidence of benefit over free-flowing oxygen. Leaks between the interface and nose are common with both nasal prongs and masks but somewhat less with prongs. All CPAP interfaces carry risk of facial distortion and nasal trauma.

Bi-level CPAP, Duo-PAP, or BIPAP are variants between CPAP and IPPV that use low pressure differences between inspiratory and expiratory phases at PIPs of 9–11 cm H 2 O at rates of around 20–40 per minute with long inspiratory times of up to 1.0 s. There is no evidence that BIPAP confers any advantage over CPAP, and any clinical differences may simply reflect a higher overall mean airway pressure. Modern ventilators provide NIPPV using pressures similar to those used for invasive MV. Challenges of NIPPV relate to pressure delivery through a non-sealed system, which is limited by leak at the nasal interface and the infant's tolerance to gas inflation of the stomach. Ventilator inflations can be synchronised with the infant's breathing by using either an abdominal capsule or in-line sensors. Synchronisation of nasal ventilation further improves respiratory stability. Recent systematic reviews comparing different modes of NIV for primary respiratory support or post-extubation concluded that synchronised NIPPV was the most effective, decreasing the need for MV, or re-ventilation, in preterm infants.

### Subxiphoid-subcostal versus transthoracic thoracoscopic thymectomy: a safe and feasible approach [^d59859b7]. JTCVS Techniques (2022). Medium credibility.

In our ST cohort, 3 out of 40 patients (7.5%) had respiratory complications, of whom 2 needed invasive ventilation and 1 needed bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP). One of these 3 patients had ocular myasthenia gravis and had an extensive evaluation and optimization by the neurologist before surgery. The etiology of his postoperative respiratory failure was unclear and neurology did not attribute it to myasthenic crisis. The other 2 patients did not have a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis; 1 was reintubated in the recovery room because she was oversedated and was extubated on postoperative day 1. The other patient with a background history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and significant anxiety disorder needed BiPAP for a few hours postoperatively for hypoxia believed to be due to poor pain control and splinting.

In the TT group, 3 out of 16 patients had respiratory issues (18.7%). Two patients (1 with myasthenia gravis and 1 without) needed BiPAP for hypoxia believed to be due to inadequate pain control and splinting. The third patient with a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis had difficulty with immediate postoperative extubation and there was concern for myasthenic crisis although she did not meet all criteria for a cholinergic crisis. She was extubated on postoperative day 1.

Of note, we always have patients with myasthenia gravis evaluated and optimized by our neurology team that specializes in myasthenia gravis. In close collaboration with them, we aim to have the patient stabilized on medications with minimal symptoms. The neurologists and surgeons make a joint decision on the need for intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis preoperatively if indicated.

### Comparison of airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) versus biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) ventilation in COVID-19 associated ARDS using transpulmonary pressure monitoring [^50414b73]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Transpulmonary pressure monitoring

TPP- monitoring was initiated in subjects suffering from CARDS as per decision of the treating physician to optimize ventilator settings (plateau pressure, PEEP, tidal volume): In case of an endexpiratory TPP < 0mbar PEEP was increased (targeting an endexpiratory TPP of 0-10mbar) whereas in case of an endinspiratory TPP > 20-25mbar plateau pressure or tidal volume was reduced (as per hospital protocol) to target an endinspiratory TPP < 20mbar. TPP was always measured before and after a change of the ventilation mode or ventilator settings, in case of patient deterioration and as per the treating physician´s request. TPP was monitored using esophageal pressure as a surrogate for pleural pressure with a special nasogastric tube (NGT) (Nutrivent™, Löwenstein Medical) with an inflatable esophageal balloon. This NGT was positioned like a regular nasogastric tube after exclusion of contraindications. TPP was consecutively calculated by the difference of plateau pressure in inspiratory hold (representing alveolar pressure) and esophageal pressure. For the description of the correct positioning of the NGT Nutrivent™ tube and the explanation of the derived parameters (endinspiratory TPP, endexpoiratory TPP, elastance- derived TPP) please see the summary in the supplement (text 1).

Comparison of APRV- and BIPAP- mode

All subjects included in this study were ventilated in BIPAP in supine position initially with settings according to the ARDSnet recommendations. Patients with refractory hypoxemia in BIPAP- mode had a trial in APRV in supine position at the discretion of the intensive care consultant, according to the local practice. In this analysis, esophageal pressure, TPP, ventilator settings and pressures, arterial blood gas (ABG)-results (PaO 2, PaCO 2), sedation requirements, grade of sedation (GCS- and RASS- Score) and hemodynamic parameters (heart rate, systolic, mean and diastolic blood pressure, dosage of vasopressor support) were assessed in BIPAP and APRV. To increase the monitored timeframe in both ventilator modes, the mean / median values of the three last measurements of these parameters in BIPAP were compared to the respective values of the first three measurements in APRV. Intervals between the timepoints of the individual measurements were 1–2 h apart.

### When is enteral nutrition indicated? [^baed946a]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Feeding during BiPAP and other noninvasive ventilation (NIV) treatments — The decision to start EN in adults requiring NIV should be multidisciplinary and made on a case-by-case basis with careful consideration of the patient's overall medical and nutrition status. Placement of an enteral feeding tube with a standard NIV mask will cause additional air leak. If the additional leak is unable to be compensated for, it is recommended to look into a mask with adaptor or sealing pad. If choosing to continue feeding while a patient is on NIV, postpyloric feeding may be preferred because of the likely increased aspiration risk. Achieving adequate oral intake is often insufficient; Reeves et al found that 78% of patients requiring NIV met < 80% of estimated needs via oral intake. However, in a qualitative review of randomized trials, it was found that the incidence of aspiration pneumonia was < 5%, and vomiting was an infrequent complication. The study by Reeves et al also found that patients who were unable to maintain nasal air clearance and consequently started enteral feeding while on NIV had increased airway complications, and the increased air volumes provided via NIV can cause gastric distention that may in turn worsen patients' respiratory status because of its effects on diaphragm function. A retrospective cohort study by Ferzi et al compared patients on NIV with various diet orders in the first 2 days of treatment: nil per os, PN, EN, and oral nutrition.

Respiratory devices are used to help breathing. Patients may use respiratory devices at home or in a clinical setting, such as a hospital. Examples of Respiratory Devices Continuous Ventilators Mechanically controls or helps patients' breathing while delivering a set amount of oxygen. Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure Machines Pumps air under varying pressure into the airway of the lungs. BiPAP machines use a higher pressure when you breathe in and lower pressure when you breathe out. These devices are also prescribed to people with obstructive sleep apnea to keep their airways open during sleep. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Machines Keeps your airway open by providing a stream of air at a continuous pressure through a mask. CPAP machines are often prescribed to people with obstructive sleep apnea to keep their airways open during sleep.

### Patient-ventilator interaction during acute lung injury, and the role of spontaneous breathing: part 2: airway pressure release ventilation [^62c59366]. Respiratory Care (2011). Low credibility.

Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) and bi-level positive airway pressure (BIPAP) are proposed to reduce patient work of breathing (WOB) sufficiently and to obviate issues related to patient-ventilator synchrony, so that spontaneous breathing can be maintained throughout the course of acute lung injury (ALI). Thus, APRV/BIPAP should reduce requirements for sedation and muscle paralysis, and thereby reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation. Only 17 human, animal, or lung-model studies have examined these claims, either directly or indirectly. Most did not target patients with ALI. Studies on sedation use have serious methodological limitations. Other studies found that APRV/BIPAP either increased WOB and asynchrony, or had no effect on energy expenditure. To supplement the discussion of patient WOB during APRV/BIPAP in ALI, 4 clinical examples showed marked elevation and wide variation in patient WOB. One plausible explanation is that spontaneous breathing is superimposed upon the mechanical ventilation pattern. Thus a variety of "breathing environments" exist during APRV/BIPAP that affect patient WOB and respiratory drive differently and perhaps unpredictably. This characteristic of APRV/BIPAP makes WOB comparisons with traditional modes problematic. Furthermore, the theoretical benefits of APRV, in terms of controlling patient WOB, appear particularly limited when lung-protective ventilation is used for ALI patients with high minute ventilation demand. Future research should focus on issues of WOB and synchrony, so that reasonable ventilation protocols can be devised to test clinical outcomes against traditional modes. To date, low-level evidence suggests that promoting spontaneous breathing with APRV/BIPAP may not be appropriate in patients with relatively severe ALI/ARDS.

### A comparison of continuous and bi-level positive airway pressure non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema: a meta-analysis [^0ccfc4d8]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

A literature search was conducted using the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2005 issue 3), and EMBASE and MEDLINE databases (1966 to 1 December 2005). Only randomized controlled clinical trials comparing BiPAP with CPAP in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema were included. Studies comparing BiPAP with CPAP in a heterogeneous group of patients with different causes of acute respiratory failure were excluded unless outcomes data for the subgroup of patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema were available. Studies using both CPAP and BiPAP in the same group of patients in a crossover design were excluded because the clinical outcomes as a result of a particular treatment modality could not be ascertained. During the electronic database search, the following exploded MeSH terms were used: 'bilevel', 'pressure support', 'non-invasive', 'CPAP', or 'positive pressure', with 'ventilation' or 'support' and with 'pulmonary oedema', 'cardiac failure', 'heart failure', or 'respiratory failure'. The reference lists of related reviews and original articles identified were searched for relevant trials. Finally, the websites of the International Network of Agencies of Health Technology Assessment and International Society of Technology Assessment in Health Care were searched to ensure that all suitable studies were included. The authors of one study were contacted to obtain additional information but they did not respond to the request. No studies published in languages other than English were found in the literature search.

### Non-invasive ventilation for the management of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure due to exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^a6db83e8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) is commonly used to treat patients admitted to hospital with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF) secondary to an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD).

Objectives

To compare the efficacy of NIV applied in conjunction with usual care versus usual care involving no mechanical ventilation alone in adults with AHRF due to AECOPD. The aim of this review is to update the evidence base with the goals of supporting clinical practice and providing recommendations for future evaluation and research.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR), which is derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), and PsycINFO, and through handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. This update to the original review incorporates the results of database searches up to January 2017.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials that compared usual care plus NIV (BiPAP) versus usual care alone in an acute hospital setting for patients with AECOPD due to AHRF were eligible for inclusion. AHRF was defined by a mean admission pH < 7.35 and mean partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) > 45 mmHg (6 kPa). Primary review outcomes were mortality during hospital admission and need for endotracheal intubation. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay, treatment intolerance, complications, changes in symptoms, and changes in arterial blood gases.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently applied the selection criteria to determine study eligibility, performed data extraction, and determined risk of bias in accordance with Cochrane guidelines. Review authors undertook meta-analysis for data that were both clinically and statistically homogenous, and analysed data as both one overall pooled sample and according to two predefined subgroups related to exacerbation severity (admission pH between 7.35 and 7.30 vs below 7.30) and NIV treatment setting (intensive care unit-based vs ward-based). We reported results for mortality, need for endotracheal intubation, and hospital length of stay in a 'Summary of findings' table and rated their quality in accordance with GRADE criteria.

Main Results

We included in the review 17 randomised controlled trials involving 1264 participants. Available data indicate that mean age at recruitment was 66.8 years (range 57.7 to 70.5 years) and that most participants (65%) were male. Most studies (12/17) were at risk of performance bias, and for most (14/17), the risk of detection bias was uncertain. These risks may have affected subjective patient-reported outcome measures (e.g. dyspnoea) and secondary review outcomes, respectively. Use of NIV decreased the risk of mortality by 46% (risk ratio (RR) 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 0.76; N = 12 studies; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 12, 95% CI 9 to 23) and decreased the risk of needing endotracheal intubation by 65% (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.46; N = 17 studies; NNTB 5, 95% CI 5 to 6). We graded both outcomes as 'moderate' quality owing to uncertainty regarding risk of bias for several studies. Inspection of the funnel plot related to need for endotracheal intubation raised the possibility of some publication bias pertaining to this outcome. NIV use was also associated with reduced length of hospital stay (mean difference (MD) -3.39 days, 95% CI -5.93 to -0.85; N = 10 studies), reduced incidence of complications (unrelated to NIV) (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.53; N = 2 studies), and improvement in pH (MD 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.07; N = 8 studies) and in partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2) (MD 7.47 mmHg, 95% CI 0.78 to 14.16 mmHg; N = 8 studies) at one hour. A trend towards improvement in PaCO 2 was observed, but this finding was not statistically significant (MD -4.62 mmHg, 95% CI -11.05 to 1.80 mmHg; N = 8 studies). Post hoc analysis revealed that this lack of benefit was due to the fact that data from two studies at high risk of bias showed baseline imbalance for this outcome (worse in the NIV group than in the usual care group). Sensitivity analysis revealed that exclusion of these two studies resulted in a statistically significant positive effect of NIV on PaCO 2. Treatment intolerance was significantly greater in the NIV group than in the usual care group (risk difference (RD) 0.11, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.17; N = 6 studies). Results of analysis showed a non-significant trend towards reduction in dyspnoea with NIV compared with usual care (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.16, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.02; N = 4 studies). Subgroup analyses revealed no significant between-group differences.

Authors' Conclusions

Data from good quality randomised controlled trials show that NIV is beneficial as a first-line intervention in conjunction with usual care for reducing the likelihood of mortality and endotracheal intubation in patients admitted with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The magnitude of benefit for these outcomes appears similar for patients with acidosis of a mild (pH 7.30 to 7.35) versus a more severe nature (pH < 7.30), and when NIV is applied within the intensive care unit (ICU) or ward setting.

Conclusions

Non-invasive respiratory support is widely used for acute respiratory failure in and outside ICUs.

HFNT requires a specific interface and offer several benefits, including low-level positive airway pressure, anatomical dead space clearance, and humidification, ensuring comfort and tolerance. Both CPAP and BiPAP increase end-expiratory lung volume, reduce intrapulmonary shunt, and improve respiratory mechanics. In patients with CPE, they support cardiac function by lowering LV afterload and RV preload. BiPAP effectively improves minute ventilation and CO 2 clearance while unloading respiratory muscles and decreasing WOB.

CPAP and BiPAP can be delivered through either a facemask or a helmet. With facemask, separate inflow and outflow ports, combined with a high bias flow, help reduce CO₂ rebreathing, while during H-CPAP, a fresh gas flow rate above 30–40 L/min prevents CO₂ rebreathing. Both "overpressure" (from high gas flow and/or additional devices) and "insufficient flow" (from strong inspiratory effort) should be avoided. Helmets with low internal volume and compliance should be used for H-BiPAP to reduce the risk of asynchronies.

In CPE, either CPAP or BiPAP should be used, while HFNT benefits patients requiring prolonged NIV or intolerant CPAP/BiPAP. In de-novo AHRF not requiring immediate intubation, HFNT should be considered the first-line treatment. There is no clear recommendation for using CPAP or BiPAP over COT; however, CPAP/BiPAP is preferred in COVID-19-related AHRF to prevent intubation. The choice of NIV interface in both cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic AHRF should aim to minimize leaks, ensure effective CO 2 clearance, and maximize tolerance. In case of respiratory acidosis, BiPAP via facemask is strongly recommended since it prevents endotracheal intubation and reduces mortality.

Close monitoringwith physiological, clinical, and bedside toolsduring NIV is essential to prevent P-SILI and avoid delayed intubation.

### Noninvasive ventilation in acute hypoxemic nonhypercapnic respiratory failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4fb644d9]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The present systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that the application of NIV was associated with significant lower endotracheal intubation rate (13.4% relative reduction) and hospital mortality (12.4% relative reduction) compared with standard oxygen therapy in patients with acute hypoxemic nonhypercapnic respiratory failure unrelated to COPD exacerbation or CPE. Furthermore, subanalyses suggested that the application of BiPAP was associated with a reduction in ICU mortality. Helmet NIV could reduce hospital mortality, whereas face/nasal mask NIV could not.

Recently, Cabrini et al made a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of 78 RCTs, which reported that NIV improves survival in all acute care settings and it is also widely used. However, much of the current evidence for the use of NIV was overestimated by including a heterogeneous population of patients with ARF who had COPD exacerbation or CPE. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of NIV in patients with acute hypoxemic nonhypercapnic respiratory failure in absence of a CPE or COPD exacerbation. Eleven high-quality RCTs were included, and the robust results recommended application of NIV in patients with acute hypoxemic nonhypercapnic respiratory failure without COPD exacerbation or CPE.

The subgroup analysis of NIV interfaces suggested that helmet NIV could reduce intubation rate and hospital mortality, whereas face/nasal mask NIV could not, which is consistent with much of the current evidence. This effect might be attributed to good amenity, better tolerance, and universal application of helmet ventilation. However, it should be noted that only three studies with small sample sizes (165 vs 588 using mask) had investigated this variable in this meta-analysis. Therefore, larger RCTs are still needed to confirm the results.

Studies have shown that CPAP can improve gas exchange, decrease respiratory and heart rate, reduce the need for invasive ventilation, and reduce hospital mortality. BiPAP delivers positive airway pressure at two different levels during inspiration and expiration, and can decrease inspiratory work of breathing more than CPAP can alone. As shown in the subgroup analysis by ventilation mode, different ventilator modes have no difference in reducing the intubation rate. However, BiPAP could reduce the ICU mortality, whereas CPAP could not. Similarly, RCTs with BiPAP involved fewer patients (221 vs 532 receiving CPAP). Therefore, conclusions regarding the relative effectiveness of BiPAP mode are limited. More studies are needed to answer this question definitively.

### A comparison of continuous and bi-level positive airway pressure non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema: a meta-analysis [^c126966b]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Two independent reviewers examined the titles and the abstracts of all identified trials to confirm that they fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The same reviewers examined and recorded the trial characteristics and outcomes independently, using a pre-designed data abstraction form. This abstraction form was used to record information regarding the quality of the trial, such as allocation concealment, randomization method, blinding of treatment, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality of the study was scored according to the Jadad scale (range from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating better quality), but the individual component that constitutes the quality of the study was also described. The grading of allocation concealment was based on the Cochrane approach (i.e. adequate or uncertain or clearly inadequate). Blinding of the attending physician who decided when to initiate invasive ventilation or to cease noninvasive ventilation with the assigned mode of noninvasive ventilation (for instance CPAP or BiPAP) was required for a study to qualify as double blind. Any disagreements between the two independent reviewers were resolved by consensus. Data were checked and entered into the Review Manager (version 4.2.6 for Windows, 2003; The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) database for further analysis.

The hospital mortality and the proportion of patients requiring invasive ventilation (or intubation) were chosen as main outcomes of this meta-analysis because they are the most relevant clinical outcomes of noninvasive ventilation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. The criteria for requiring invasive ventilation varied between studies, but the common criteria included poor state of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤ 13), respiratory arrest or significant respiratory distress (respiratory rate > 40 breaths/minute), persistent hypoxaemia despite supplementary oxygen (arterial oxygen tension < 60 mmHg) and progressive increases in PaCO 2 despite CPAP or BiPAP treatment (> 5 mmHg). The other outcomes assessed in the meta-analysis included the proportion of patients who developed new onset acute myocardial infarction after initiation of BiPAP or CPAP, duration of noninvasive ventilation needed till the pulmonary oedema resolved, and length of hospital stay. The criteria and process of weaning from CPAP or BiPAP varied between studies, but the common criteria included absence of respiratory distress with respiratory rate below 25 breaths/minute and pulse oximetry saturation of 95% or greater. The weaning process usually involved stepwise reduction in inspiratory and expiratory pressures (2 cmH 2 O) and inspired oxygen concentration (10%).

Non-invasive respiratory support including high flow nasal therapy (HFNT), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), exerts distinct physiological effects and requires specific settings and technicalities. HFNT, delivered through dedicated nasal cannulas, provides low levels of positive airway pressure, anatomical dead space washout, allows good patient tolerance and can be used during CPAP or BiPAP breaks. CPAP and BiPAP, administered through various interfaces (e.g. facemasks, oro-nasal masks, or helmets), can deliver higher positive pressure, thereby increasing end-expiratory lung volume, reducing intrapulmonary shunt and oxygenation, with potential benefits on respiratory mechanics as well. BiPAP also delivers pressure support, aiding CO₂ clearance and respiratory muscle unloading, which is especially useful in hypercapnic respiratory failure. Increased intrathoracic pressure also reduces right ventricle preload and left ventricle afterload, which is beneficial in patients with impaired left ventricular function. Non-invasive respiratory support indications depend on the cause of acute respiratory failure. In hypercapnic respiratory failure with respiratory acidosis, BiPAP via facemask is strongly recommended to prevent intubation and reduce mortality. In cardiogenic pulmonary edema, either CPAP or BiPAP is recommended, while HFNT can be useful for patients requiring prolonged support or when CPAP/BiPAP is not tolerated even after ventilator and interface settings optimization. In de-novo acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, HFNT should be considered as the first-line treatment, regardless of the aetiology: however, in COVID-19-related AHRF CPAP can be considered to avoid intubation. The choice of non-invasive respiratory support interface in both cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic AHRF should aim at minimizing leaks, optimizing CO 2 clearance, and maximizing patient tolerance. Monitoring is essential during non-invasive respiratory support to assess patient's response to treatment and to avoid delaying invasive respiratory support when needed, particularly in hypoxemic patients to avoid intubation delays and prevent patient-self-inflicted lung injury: physiological parameters, clinical scores, and lung ultrasound may help assess the risk of NIV failure. Monitoring tidal volume is valuable but challenging because of leaks. Though not widely used, esophageal pressure monitoring can assess patient effort and transpulmonary pressure. Additionally, electrical impedance tomography is an emerging tool for detecting asynchronous breathing and pendelluft phenomena.

### Biphasic positive airway pressure spontaneous breathing attenuates lung injury in an animal model of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome [^7f700ea5]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread throughout the world. COVID-19 mainly involves the respiratory system, and there is less damage to other organs. Studies have shown that critically ill patients can be complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome, with an incidence rate of 15.6–31%. Mechanical ventilation is the main supportive treatment of ARDS, and improved ventilation methods, such as biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP), significantly improved the survival rate of ARDS patients. Based on the open lung strategy, BIPAP is a time-switched, pressure-controlled ventilation mode that can superimpose fully spontaneous breathing (SB) at two different levels of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) without confrontation. In this ventilation mode, SB can occur at any stage of the ventilation cycle. BIPAP ventilation is a ventilation mode that can prevent and reduce the occurrence of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).

### Leak compensation in positive pressure ventilators: a lung model study [^c1cfe233]. The European Respiratory Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Leak compensating abilities of six different positive pressure ventilators commonly used to deliver noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, including the bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) S/T-D and Quantum (Respironics Inc, Murrysville, PA, USA), 335 and O'NYX (Mallinckrodt Inc, St Louis, MO, USA), PLV 102 (Respironics), and Siemens Servo 900C (Siemens Inc, Danvers, MA, USA). Using a test lung model, compensatory capabilities of the ventilators were tested for smaller and larger leaks using the assist/control or timed modes. Back-up rate was 20 min(-1), inspiratory pressure was 18 cmH2O, and expiratory pressure was 5 cmH2O. It was found that even in the absence of air leaking, delivered tidal volume differed substantially between the ventilators during use of pressure-targeted modes, depending on inspiratory flows, inaccuracies in set versus delivered pressures, and inspiratory duration. Also during pressure-targeted ventilation, increasing the tI/ttot up to, but not beyond, 0.5 improved compensation by lengthening inspiratory duration, whereas use of a sensitive flow trigger setting tended to cause autocycling during leaking, interfering with compensation. Leaking interfered with cycling of the BiPAP S/T, inverting the I:E ratio, shortening expiratory time, and reducing delivered tidal volume. Volume-targeted modes achieved limited compensation for small air leaks, but compensated poorly for large leaks. To conclude, leak-compensating capabilities differ markedly between ventilators but pressure-targeted ventilators are preferred for noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in patients with substantial air leaking. Adequate inspiratory flows and durations should be used, triggering sensitivity should be adjusted to prevent autocycling, and a mechanism should be available to limit inspiratory time and avoid I:E ratio inversion.

### A comparison of continuous and bi-level positive airway pressure non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema: a meta-analysis [^091f238f]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema is a common medical emergency. The majority of patients with acute pulmonary oedema will improve with oxygen and pharmacological therapy. However, assisted ventilation may be needed in patients with severe cardiogenic pulmonary oedema who remain hypoxaemic and in respiratory distress despite conventional medical therapy.

Studies have shown that noninvasive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation can improve gas exchange, decrease respiratory and heart rate, reduce the need for invasive ventilation and reduce hospital mortality. Noninvasive bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation delivers positive airway pressure at two different levels during inspiration and expiration, and can decrease inspiratory work of breathing more than CPAP can alone. Studies evaluating BiPAP in acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema have shown that it improves gas exchange and reduces the need for invasive ventilation in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure compared with conventional medical therapy. However, none of these studies demonstrated a reduction in hospital mortality. Furthermore, the results of one of the earlier studies suggested that BiPAP compared with CPAP might increase the risk for new onset acute myocardial infarction in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Whether BiPAP is advantageous compared with CPAP in acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema remains uncertain.

In the present meta-analysis we assessed the potential beneficial and harmful effects of BiPAP compared with CPAP in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. We also assessed whether the BiPAP may be more advantageous when the pressure used during BiPAP is titrated according to clinical need and in the subgroup of patients with significant hypercapnia (mean arterial carbon dioxide tension [PaCO 2] > 45 mmHg).

Moderate-to-severe hypoxia (e.g. PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 150 mmHg) has been associated with a higher risk of NIV failure and worse outcomes, including increased ICU mortality, raising concerns about the use of NIV in patients with severe AHRF. The following factors have also been associated with facemask NIV failure during de novo AHRF: age greater than 40 years, extra-respiratory organ failure, persistent hypoxemia, an increase in PaCO 2 during the first 48 h of treatment, and worsening radiologic infiltrates 24 h after admission. High tidal volume has been independently associated with NIV failure and 90 days mortality, with volumes greater than 9 mL/kg has been identified as a strong predictor of intubation. During BiPAP, injurious tidal volumes and transpulmonary driving pressures may result from both excessive inspiratory effort or PS. Moreover, when patient inspiratory effort remains relatively constant (i.e. does not decrease in response to PS), tidal volume and transpulmonary driving pressure increase as a function of PS level and lung compliance. Consequently, the absence of decrease or even the increase in inspiratory effort, coupled with excessive PS, may result in non-protective ventilation, which can cause NIV failure, and further exacerbate lung injury. These pathophysiological mechanisms may explain some concerning findings associating BiPAP to increased risk of mortality. Retrospective data from COVID-19 patients indicated that BiPAP was associated with the highest mortality rate compared to CPAP and HFNT, even after adjustment of major covariates. Furthermore, a recent analysis of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry found prolonged BiPAP use before intubation - versus other non-invasive supports or the absence of NIV - was independently associated with higher hospital mortality in severe COVID-19 patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

### Airway pressure release ventilation versus assist-control ventilation: a comparative propensity score and international cohort study [^2286b224]. Intensive Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients receiving airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) or biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) to assist-control ventilation (A/C) as their primary mode of ventilatory support. The objective was to estimate if patients ventilated with APRV/BIPAP have a lower mortality.

Methods

Secondary analysis of an observational study in 349 intensive care units from 23 countries. A total of 234 patients were included who were ventilated only with APRV/BIPAP and 1,228 patients who were ventilated only with A/C. A case-matched analysis according to a propensity score was used to make comparisons between groups.

Results

In logistic regression analysis, the most important factor associated with the use of APRV/BIPAP was the country (196 of 234 patients were from German units). Patients with coma or congestive heart failure as the reason to start mechanical ventilation, pH < 7.15 prior to mechanical ventilation, and patients who developed respiratory failure (SOFA score > 2) after intubation with or without criteria of acute respiratory distress syndrome were less likely to be ventilated with APRV/BIPAP. In the case-matched analysis there were no differences in outcomes, including mortality in the intensive care unit, days of mechanical ventilation or weaning, rate of reintubation, length of stay in the intensive care unit or hospital, and mortality in the hospital.

Conclusions

In this study, the APRV/BIPAP ventilation mode is being used widely across many causes of respiratory failure, but only in selected geographic areas. In our patient population we could not demonstrate any improvement in outcomes with APRV/BIPAP compared with assist-control ventilation.

BiPAP seems to open up the airways more than CPAP and, in particular, works to keep the small part of the lungs. more open. This may be due to the different pressures favouring gas exchange.

Other areas of clinical implementation of NIV: acute decompensation of obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS)

OHS is a severe form of obesity-induced respiratory compromise, defined by the coexistance of obesity, sleep-disordered breathing, and daytime hypercapnia (awake resting PaCO 2 ≥ 45 mmHg). The pathophysiology of OHS involves reduced functional residual capacity due to obesity, impaired central response to hypercapnia and hypoxia, sleep-related breathing disorders, and neurohormonal abnormalities. In stableambulatory OHS, positive airway pressure therapy improves the control of the obstructive sleep apnoea, enhances sleep quality, and optimize daytime gas-exchange. Therefore, CPAP is suggested as first-line treatment for outpatients with OHS and concurrent severe obstructive sleep apnea. OHS exacerbation is a common cause of acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, often requiring ICU admission, particularly in the presence of respiratory acidosis. Compared to normocapnic patients with obesity, those with OHS have higher ICU admission rates and mortality. However, no formal guidelines for non-invasive management of the acute OHS decompensation, as most studies focus on ambulatory chronic patients. In the acute setting, BiPAP is considered the therapy of choice, as it maintains upper airway patency, unloads respiratory muscle, and improves alveolar ventilation. Full face mask are more effective than nasal mask in acutely ill patients, as they allow the delivery of higher pressures with reduced leakage.

Other areas of clinical implementation of NIV: pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis (CF)

CF lung disease is characterized by progressive airflow obstruction due to mucus plugging, bronchial inflammation, and destruction of the lung parenchyma secondary to bronchiectasies, progressively leading to increased respiratory muscle workload to ensure adequate ventilation. The clinical course of CF is characterized by "pulmonary exacerbations", due to the inability of the respiratory muscles to meet the increased ventilation demand (e.g. respiratory tract infections), leading to hypercapnic respiratory failure. During acute exacerbations of CF, BiPAP is frequently used to unload the respiratory muscles, increase alveolar ventilation and enhance gas exchange. Although no RCTs are available comparing NIV to invasive ventilation, observational studies have shown that BiPAP is a reasonable first-line treatment option for hospitalised patients with severe respiratory exacerbations of CF, given the poor outcome of the patients undergoing invasive ventilation. HFNT therapy may serve as a viable alternative or complement to BiPAP, as it has demonstrated physiological benefits, such as reducing respiratory rate and minute ventilation.

In addition, the application of CPAP has been associated with a decrease in airway resistance by reducing the interstitial edema due to fluid accumulation in the peri-bronchial region.

Finally, when PEEP is delivered through a helmet, it acts as a semi-closed "oxygen tent", ensuring precise FiO 2 delivery as set by the physician. This may contribute to improved oxygenation alongside lung and heart effects. A ZEEP-PEEP test –evaluating oxygenation and haemodynamics without helmet, after 10 min helmet without PEEP valve and after 10 min with PEEP valve) - helps identify patients who benefit from PEEP and weighs its benefits against risks, particularly when CPAP is poorly tolerated, or potentially harmful (e.g. hemodynamic instability due to hypovolemic status, or high risk of barotrauma).

Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP)

Physiologic effects of bipap

BiPAP ventilation, also known as pressure support non-invasive ventilation (NIV-PS) or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), is characterized by the application of two levels of pressure: one during the inspiratory phase – delivered as on-demand flow, simultaneously to the patient's inspiration (e.g.PS) – and another which is maintained continuously throughout the respiratory cycle (e.g.PEEP). BiPAP provides similar beneficial effects to CPAP on both lung and cardiac function. Through the application of PEEP, BiPAP increases lung volumes and improves oxygenation.

Like CPAP, BiPAP has a positive effect on right ventricle preload and left ventricle afterload, particularly in conditions of heart failure. In addition, BiPAP results in higher minute ventilation, improved CO 2 clearance, reduced inspiratory effort and WOB compared to CPAP alone. In the presence of "solid-like" injured lung, uneven pleural pressure transmission across the lung parenchyma can cause gas shifts (e.g. pendelluft) from the non-dependent to the dependent regions, leading to transient overdistension and tidal recruitment in the dependent lung regions during early inspiration. BiPAP may reduce lung stress and pendelluft phenomenon by decreasing the patients in inspiratory effort.

### Regional lung aeration and ventilation during pressure support and biphasic positive airway pressure ventilation in experimental lung injury [^bba65929]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Assisted mechanical ventilation

During BIPAP+SB mean we detected spontaneous breathing only on low but not on high continuous positive P aw levels. Minute ventilation did not differ between PSV and BIPAP+SB mean (Table 1). However, mean V T was higher, whereas mean RR was lower during PSV. Ppeak during BIPAP+SB controlled and PSV were comparable. The time spent during inspiration was proportionally shorter in BIPAP+SB mean than PSV, as reflected by Ti/Tot. Pmean during BIPAP+SB mean did not differ from PSV. However, Pmean and Ppl mean were higher during BIPAP+SB controlled and lower during BIPAP+SB spont as compared with PSV. PEEP i, dyn values did not differ between assisted mechanical ventilation modes, but values of P 0.1 and PTP were higher during BIPAP+SB mean compared with PSV.

Arterial oxygenation and hemodynamic variables did not differ between the assisted mechanical ventilation modes, but PaCO 2 was higher during BIPAP+SB mean than PSV (Table 2).

The statistical analysis evidenced no effect of the sequence of ventilation modes on the hyperaerated, normally aerated, poorly aerated, and nonaerated compartments at end-expiration. The Additional files 2 and 3 show CT dyn videos of lungs during BIPAP+SB mean and PSV in one animal, respectively.

During BIPAP+SB mean and PSV, we observed at end-expiration and end-inspiration (Figures 1 and 2, respectively) a gravity-dependent loss of lung aeration, characterized by increase of nonaerated and poorly aerated areas, as well as decrease in hyperaerated and normally aerated tissue in dorsal zones, as compared with ventral ones (P < 0.0001). Similarly, the percentages of nonaerated and poorly aerated areas increased, whereas those from normally aerated and hyperaerated areas decreased from lung apex to base following the gravitational gradient, independent from the assisted mechanical ventilation mode and lung zone (P < 0.0001).

### A clinical guide to non-invasive respiratory support in acute respiratory failure: ventilation settings, technical optimization and clinical indications [^f2b3f96c]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-invasive respiratory support refers to the delivery of respiratory support with no endotracheal tube or tracheostomy canula in place.

It includes high-flow nasal therapy (HFNT), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP). CPAP and BiPAP, often merged under the broad term non-invasive ventilation (NIV), can be applied through various interfaces (Fig. 1) depending on clinical indication, local availability and patient comfort and preference.

BiPAP via facemask with double limb circuit vs. single limb circuit and intentional leaks (left); BiPAP via full-face mask with double port vs. BiPAP via oro-nasal mask with one port. Panel C. Helmet CPAP vs. Helmet BiPAP. List of abbreviation: BiPAP: bilevel positive airway pressure; CPAP: continuous positive airway pressure; HFNT: high flow nasal therapy

Non-invasive respiratory support is widely employed in the acute care setting and clinical indication include acute respiratory failure of various etiologies. During the Coronavirus Disease (COVID)−19 pandemic pandemic, the overwhelming number of patients requiring respiratory support, coupled with limited number of ventilators and intensive care unit (ICU) beds, contributed to the further spreading of non-invasive techniques.

NIV offer several advantages, including minimal or no sedation requirements, avoidance of muscle paralysis, and reduced risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Furthermore, it is feasible and safe outside ICU with proper monitoring. However, NIV drawbacks include patient-ventilator asynchrony, risk of delayed intubation, and, in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, the risk of patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI).

This review discusses physiological effects and clinical indications of the main non-invasive respiratory support modalities. It focuses on the variety of the commercially available machines and interfaces and the related settings and technical considerations to enhance non-invasive respiratory support performance and patient tolerance.

Limitations and strengths

Our study has several limitations. The retrospective, monocentric setting of our study restricted to a small number of patients limits the generalizability of the data. Additionally, all patients were ventilated in BIPAP first and consecutively in APRV- mode (on 3.05 ± 2.31 days after ICU admission) as a rescue- mode for refractory hypoxemia. This leaves the time effect as a potential confounder and the data can probably not be extrapolated to APRV- mode as a primary mode of ventilation. But as shown in our study, patients were not deteriorating regarding oxygenation, decarboxylation, lung compliance, lung resistance or hemodynamic stability during the study interval assessed. Therefore TPP- measurements during the examined interval in BIPAP and APRV- mode should not be affected by a time component.

Another limitation of our study is, that TPP was not monitored continuously but only at certain timepoints and that only 4 patients of our study were paralyzed. TPP values may not be comparable in non-paralyzed patients and paralyzed patients and TPP values are more prone to artifacts in spontaneous breathing. But all patients in this study were sedated to a RASS Score of -5 and a GCS Score of 3 to avoid spontaneous breathing. None of the patients included in our study were breathing spontaneously. Moreover, TPP as derived from esophageal pressure monitoring, does not reflect all lung regions equally but mainly represents esophageal pressure midesophageal between non-dependent and dependent lung areas. Same can be stated about the intrinsic PEEP which can vary in different regions of the lungs as CARDS is a heterogenous lung disease. To overcome this problem, endinspiratory TPP values were measured directly with the plateau- derived method and additionally calculated using the elastance-derived method. Another limitation of our study is that the duration of ventilation in APRV was potentially too short to see a benefit regarding oxygenation and decarboxylation. In our study, APRV was terminated in most cases within ≤ 6 h as an increased risk of atelectrauma was witnessed in form of a negative endexpiratory TPP, despite adjustment of ventilator settings as the reduction of T low. Since the same patients were ventilated in BIPAP and APRV consecutively, we did not assess outcome parameters such as length of invasive ventilation, length of ICU- / Hospital- stay and 30-day mortality in our study.

### Non-invasive ventilatory support in preterm neonates in the delivery room and the neonatal intensive care unit: a short narrative review of what we know in 2024 [^92d73c26]. Neonatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Guidelines recommend non-invasive ventilatory (NIV) support as first-line respiratory support mode in preterm infants as NIV is superior to intubation and mechanical ventilation in preventing death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, with an ever-expanding variety of NIV modes available, there is much debate about which NIV modality should ideally be used, how, and when. The aims of this work were to summarise the evidence on different NIV modalities for both primary and secondary respiratory support: nCPAP, nasal high-flow therapy (nHFT), and nasal intermittent positive airway pressure ventilation (nIPPV), bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP), nasal high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (nHFOV), and nasally applied, non-invasive neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NIV-NAVA) modes, with particular focus on their use in preterm infants.

Summary

This is a narrative review with reference to published guidelines by European Consensus Guidelines on the Management of Respiratory Distress Syndrome: 2022 Update. nCPAP is currently the most commonly used primary and secondary NIV modality for premature infants. However, there is increasing evidence on the superiority of nIPPV over nCPAP. No beneficial effect was found for BiPAP over nCPAP. For the use of nHFT, nHFOV, and NIV-NAVA, more studies are needed to establish their place in neonatal respiratory care.

Key Messages

The superiority of nIPPV over nCPAP needs to be confirmed by contemporaneous trials comparing nCPAP to nIPPV at comparable mean airway pressures. Future trials should study NIV modalities in preterm infants with comparable respiratory pathology and indications, at comparable pressure settings and with different modes of synchronisation. Importantly, future trials should not exclude infants of the smallest gestational ages.

### Regional lung aeration and ventilation during pressure support and biphasic positive airway pressure ventilation in experimental lung injury [^716998ee]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

There is an increasing interest in biphasic positive airway pressure with spontaneous breathing (BIPAP+SBmean), which is a combination of time-cycled controlled breaths at two levels of continuous positive airway pressure (BIPAP+SBcontrolled) and non-assisted spontaneous breathing (BIPAP+SBspont), in the early phase of acute lung injury (ALI). However, pressure support ventilation (PSV) remains the most commonly used mode of assisted ventilation. To date, the effects of BIPAP+SBmean and PSV on regional lung aeration and ventilation during ALI are only poorly defined.

Methods

In 10 anesthetized juvenile pigs, ALI was induced by surfactant depletion. BIPAP+SBmean and PSV were performed in a random sequence (1 h each) at comparable mean airway pressures and minute volumes. Gas exchange, hemodynamics, and inspiratory effort were determined and dynamic computed tomography scans obtained. Aeration and ventilation were calculated in four zones along the ventral-dorsal axis at lung apex, hilum and base.

Results

Compared to PSV, BIPAP+SBmean resulted in: 1) lower mean tidal volume, comparable oxygenation and hemodynamics, and increased PaCO2 and inspiratory effort; 2) less nonaerated areas at end-expiration; 3) decreased tidal hyperaeration and re-aeration; 4) similar distributions of ventilation. During BIPAP+SBmean: i) BIPAP+SBspont had lower tidal volumes and higher rates than BIPAP+SBcontrolled; ii) BIPAP+SBspont and BIPAP+SBcontrolled had similar distributions of ventilation and aeration; iii) BIPAP+SBcontrolled resulted in increased tidal re-aeration and hyperareation, compared to PSV. BIPAP+SBspont showed an opposite pattern.

Conclusions

In this model of ALI, the reduction of tidal re-aeration and hyperaeration during BIPAP+SBmean compared to PSV is not due to decreased nonaerated areas at end-expiration or different distribution of ventilation, but to lower tidal volumes during BIPAP+SBspont. The ratio between spontaneous to controlled breaths seems to play a pivotal role in reducing tidal re-aeration and hyperaeration during BIPAP+SBmean.

### Regional lung aeration and ventilation during pressure support and biphasic positive airway pressure ventilation in experimental lung injury [^a0b98437]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Maintenance of spontaneous breathing activity during ventilatory support in acute lung injury (ALI) may improve pulmonary gas exchange, systemic blood flow, and oxygen supply to the tissues. Most importantly, spontaneous breathing activity may contribute to decrease the time of ventilatory support and the length of stay in the intensive care unit. Although pressure support ventilation (PSV) is the most frequently used form of assisted mechanical ventilation, there is increasing interest in biphasic positive airway pressure with superposed spontaneous breathing (BIPAP+SB mean). PSV is a pressure-limited, flow-cycled mode in which every breath is supported by a constant level of pressure at the airways, thus the tidal volume (V T) and inspiratory flow may adapt to the demands of the patient. In contrast, BIPAP+SB mean is a combination of time-cycled controlled breaths at two levels of continuous positive airway pressure (BIPAP+SB controlled) and non-assisted spontaneous breathing (BIPAP+SB spont). Compared with controlled mechanical ventilation and PSV, a possible advantage of non-assisted spontaneous breath during BIPAP+SB mean is that they may generate higher transpulmonary pressures in dependent lung areas, contributing to lung recruitment, reduction of cyclic collapse/reopening and improvement of ventilation/perfusion matching.

Previous studies comparing PSV with BIPAP+SB mean have not assessed the distribution of both aeration and ventilation. In experimental ALI, we observed that aeration compartments of the whole lungs did not differ between BIPAP+SB mean or PSV and controlled mechanical ventilation. In contrast, Yoshida and colleagues suggested that, in patients with ALI, improvement of lung aeration is more pronounced during BIPAP+SB mean than PSV. However, both in an animal and patient study, aeration was assessed at end-expiration with static computed tomography (CT) during breath holding, possibly introducing artifacts. As dynamic CT (CT dyn) does not require breath holding, it may be considered a suitable technique for assessing lung aeration and ventilation during BIPAP+SB mean and PSV.

### Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation for acute asthma in children [^cec02344]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is one of the most common reasons for hospital admission among children, with significant economic burden and impact on quality of life. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) is increasingly used in the care of children with acute asthma, although the evidence supporting it is weak, and clinical guidelines do not offer any recommendations on its routine use. However, NPPV might be an effective way to improve outcomes for some children with asthma. A previous review did not demonstrate a clear benefit, but was limited by few studies with small sample sizes. This is an update of the previous review.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of NPPV as an add-on therapy to usual care (e.g. bronchodilators and corticosteroids) in children (< 18 years) with acute asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. We also conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP. We searched all databases from their inception to March 2023, with no restrictions on language of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials (RCTs) assessing NPPV as add-on therapy to usual care versus usual care for children hospitalised for acute asthma exacerbations.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods.

Main Results

We included three RCTs randomising 60 children with acute asthma to NPPV and 60 children to control. All included trials assessed the effects of bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) for acute asthma in a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) setting. None of the trials used continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The controls received standard care. The median age of children ranged from three to six years, and asthma severity ranged from moderate to severe. Our primary outcome measures were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, and asthma symptom score. Secondary outcomes were non-serious adverse events, health-related quality of life, arterial blood gases and pH, pneumonia, cost, and PICU length of stay. None of the trials reported any deaths or serious adverse events (except one trial that reported intubation rate). Two trials reported asthma symptom score, each demonstrating reductions in asthma symptoms in the BiPAP group. In one trial, the asthma symptom score was (mean difference (MD) -2.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.70 to -0.30, P = 0.03; 19 children) lower in the BiPAP group. In the other trial, a cross-over trial, BiPAP was associated with a lower mean asthma symptom score (MD -3.7; 16 children; very low certainty evidence) before cross-over, but investigators did not report a standard deviation, and it could not be estimated from the first phase of the trial before cross-over. The reduction in both trials was above our predefined minimal important difference. Overall, NPPV with standard care may reduce asthma symptom score compared to standard care alone, but the evidence is very uncertain. The only reported serious adverse event was intubation rate in one trial. The trial had an intubation rate of 40% and showed that BiPAP may result in a large reduction in intubation rate (risk ratio 0.47, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.95; 78 children), but the evidence is very uncertain. Post hoc analysis showed that BiPAP may result in a slight decrease in length of PICU stay (MD -0.87 day, 95% CI -1.52 to -0.22; 100 children), but the evidence is very uncertain. Meta-analysis or Trial Sequential Analysis was not possible because of insufficient reporting and different scoring systems. All three trials had high risk of bias with serious imprecision of results, leading to very low certainty of evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

The currently available evidence for NNPV is uncertain. NPPV may lead to an improvement in asthma symptom score, decreased intubation rate, and slightly shorter PICU stay; however, the evidence is of very low certainty. Larger RCTs with low risk of bias are warranted.

CHAPTER 12 RESPIRATORY DISORDERS

12.1 What is the policy on respiratory disorders in syndromic craniosynostosis?

Introduction

Children with craniosynostosis syndromes belong to the risk groups for sleep-related respiratory disorders characterized by upper airway obstruction. This disrupts normal breathing and sleep. The respiratory disorders are obstructive sleep apnea and hypopnea (OSA), central sleep apnea and hypopnea (CSA) and upper airway resistance (UAR).

The clinical symptoms of respiratory disorders are diverse and can be divided into symptoms at night: restless sleep, snoring, apnea, bedwetting and sweating, and during the day: dry mouth when getting up, fatigue, impaired cognitive functioning, reduced school performance and behavioral disorders. In the long term, growth disorders may occur. In addition, respiratory disorders may contribute to an increase in ICP, probably due to the cerebral vasodilation that occurs when CO 2 accumulates, causing more blood to flow to the brain and resulting in an increase in ICP. Since children with syndromic craniosynostosis often have a somewhat higher ICP, respiratory disorders in them may result in too high an ICP. In view of the seriousness of the respiratory disorders and the good treatment possibilities, early recognition is very important.

The treatment of respiratory disorders can be pharmacological, e.g. nasal corticosteroid spray or antibiotics, surgical, e.g. adenotonsillectomy or midface surgery, or non-surgical, such as nocturnal supplemental oxygen or continuous / bi-level positive airway pressure (CPAP or BiPAP). In the articles in which the European Respiratory Society presents a 'state-of-the-art' overview, a flowchart is given for the treatment of children up to 23 months old and for the treatment of older children with OSA. 1,2 There is one systematic review specific to craniosynostosis, but because it also includes case reports with only 2 patients it is not always of high quality. 3 These case reports, deal with treatment by nasopharyngeal tube (NPT), CPAP or BIPAP and tracheotomy. The NPT can be used to bridge a period pending a more definitive treatment. Respiratory support through non-invasive ventilation with CPAP or BIPAP is an accepted treatment in children with good results, but in which compliance is essential. 3 The systematic review by Nash describes that many of the 23 articles included describe a tracheal cannula for treatment of severe OSA. Eventually, surgical treatment will be necessary to eliminate the causes of the respiratory disorders.

Recommendations

1. CPAP or (s)NIPPV should be started from birth in all babies at risk of RDS, such as those < 30 weeks of gestation who do not need intubation for stabilisation (A1).

2. NIV with early rescue surfactant by LISA technique is considered optimal management for babies with RDS (A1).

3. The system delivering CPAP is of little importance; however, the interface should be short binasal prongs or mask with a starting pressure of about 6–8 cm H 2 O (A2). Ability to escalate to NIPPV will reduce the need for invasive MV in some infants (A1).

4. BIPAP devices confer no advantage over CPAP alone (A2). However, synchronised NIPPV, if delivered through a ventilator, can reduce need for ventilation or need for re-ventilation following extubation and may reduce BPD (A2).

5. HFNC can be used as an alternative to CPAP for some babies, with the advantage of less nasal trauma, provided centres have access to CPAP or NIPPV for those failing this mode (B2).

MV Strategies

Despite best efforts to maintain as many preterm babies as possible on NIV, around half of babies < 28 weeks will require MV and those that do have worse outcomes. In addition, around half of infants < 28 weeks will also fail their first attempt at extubation and they too have worse outcomes. It is important that those managing infants with RDS understand the principles of MV to minimise the risk of iatrogenic lung injury. The aim of MV is to provide "acceptable" blood gases by ventilating at optimal lung volumes (open lung concept) while avoiding over-distension and atelectasis. Pulmonary over-distension increases risk of air leaks and pulmonary interstitial emphysema, while ventilating at sub-optimally low pressures may cause atelectasis and repeated pulmonary sheer stress, which in turn can generate inflammation and lung injury.

Ventilator settings

All subjects were ventilated with Hamilton C6 ventilators (Hamilton Medical AG, Bonaduz Swiss) which have an auxiliary port for monitoring esophageal and transpulmonary pressure via a separate pressure line. Initial ventilator mode after intubation for all subjects was BIPAP- mode (DUOPAP, Hamilton Medical AG, Bonaduz Swiss) as per hospital standard. BIPAP was used as a pressure regulated mode allowing asynchronous spontaneous breathing but without pressure assist. Initial ventilator settings were chosen as per ARDSnetwork recommendations for lung protective ventilation as per hospital protocol: Tidal volume of ≤ 6 mL / kg predicted body weight (PBW), Plateau pressure ≤ 30mbar, Driving pressure ≤ 16mbar, PEEP as defined by ARDSnet table and permissive hypercapnia (if pH > 7.2). In case of transfer to APRV to improve oxygenation, this mode was set according to initial BIPAP- settings with P high < 30mbar (aiming for the same plateau pressure as in BIPAP / DUOPAP- mode), P low ≤ 5mbar and the T high at 5 s. As per hospital protocol T low was initiated at 0.5 s. Then the expiratory flow waveform was assessed and T low adjusted accordingly to achieve expiratory flow termination at 75% of peak expiratory flow. This setting of T low avoids emptying of the lung, creating an endexpiratory pressure (extrinsic PEEP plus intrinsic PEEP) counteracting lung derecruitment. In both ventilation modes pressure support ventilation (PSV) was removed as per hospital standard to avoid hyperinflation on the upper pressure level by additional spontaneous breaths. In both BIPAP and APRV automated tube compensation was applied in all patients. All subjects with CARDS were deeply sedated (Glasgow Coma scale Score (GCS) 3 and Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale Score (RASS) -5)) or even paralyzed to avoid spontaneous ventilation.

### Effect of spontaneous breathing on ventilator-induced lung injury in mechanically ventilated healthy rabbits: a randomized, controlled, experimental study [^6736ed5a]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study on the effects of spontaneous breathing on VILI in the mechanically-ventilated healthy lung. We found that preserving spontaneous breathing during MV could not only improve ventilatory function, but could also attenuate selected markers of VILI.

For our experiments, we selected tidal volume of as large as 10 to 15 ml/kg to ventilate animals with healthy lungs. Hong et al. found that a moderate tidal volume (15 ml/kg) and low PEEP (3 cmH 2 O) resulted in lower inflammatory response expressions in lung tissue and lung injury than with a small tidal volume (6 ml/kg) and high PEEP (10 cmH 2 O) in a healthy animal model. Thus, we set PEEP to 2 cmH 2 O to avoid excessive distension of alveoli and concomitantly prevent alveolar collapse at end-expiration. In addition, we applied a biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) mode during MV, which allowed animals to breathe freely at any phase of the mechanical ventilatory cycle. When rabbits did not exhibit spontaneous breathing, the BIPAP mode was equal to the pressure control ventilation (PCV) mode. Pmean, which reflects the average level of alveolar pressure during the entire respiratory cycle, is also an important factor contributing to the development of lung injury. In our study, the Pmean between the SB group and the CV group was comparable by the method of adjusting ventilator settings (detailed in Materials and methods).

### Noninvasive ventilation in acute hypoxemic nonhypercapnic respiratory failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c47e2252]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

NIV Did Not Decrease ICU Mortality in Acute Hypoxemia Nonhypercapnic Respiratory Failure Patients

Seven studies (503 patients) reported ICU mortality, which we stratified according to NIV interfaces, modes, and hypoxic severity. There were 62 of 253 deaths (24.5%) in the NIV group, compared with 90 of 250 (36.0%) in the control group. No obvious publication bias was found (Fig. S5, Supplemental Digital Content 8; legend, Supplemental Digital Content 12). The RR estimate for ICU mortality in patients treated with NIV compared with standard oxygen therapy was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.51–1.03; p = 0.08) (Fig. 4). However, we graded the overall strength of the evidence as low (Supplemental Table 3, Supplemental Digital Content 4,), which means the further research will likely change the estimate.

Figure 4.
ICU mortality in acute hypoxemic nonhypercapnic respiratory failure patients randomized to noninvasive ventilation (NIV) versus standard oxygen therapy. M-H = Mantel-Haenszel.

Notably, subgroup analysis showed that NIV significantly decreased the ICU mortality of patients with BiPAP mode but not with CPAP (Fig. S6 A, Supplemental Digital Content 9; legend, Supplemental Digital Content 12,), indicating that NIV with BiPAP modes might be effective to improve outcome of acute hypoxemia nonhypercapnic respiratory failure patients. In contrast, no significant differences in ICU mortality were found between two groups of patients with different hypoxic severity (Fig. S6 B, Supplemental Digital Content 9; legend, Supplemental Digital Content 12). Among seven RCTs reporting ICU mortality, there is only one research using helmet NIV. Thus we did not show the results of subgroup analysis according to interfaces.

### Intentional leaks in industrial masks have a significant impact on efficacy of bilevel noninvasive ventilation: a bench test study [^60a9dc27]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Background

During noninvasive ventilation, nonintentional leaks have a detrimental effect on the efficacy of ventilation. A wide range of industrial masks are available, with intentional leaks of different importance. The potential impact of this variability in intentional leaks on performances of bilevel ventilators has not been assessed.

Objective

To measure intentional leaks in seven different industrial masks and determine whether higher leaks modify ventilator performance and quality of ventilation.

Methods

Seven interfaces connected to four ventilators, the VPAP III ST (ResMed; NorthRyde, Australia), the BiPAP Harmony (Respironics; Monroeville, PA), the SmartAir ST (Covidien/Airox; Pau, France), and the GoodKnight 425 ST Bilevel (Covidien/Tyco-Nellcor/Puritan Bennett; Pleasanton, CA), were adapted on a mannequin connected to a lung model (ASL5000, IngMar Medical; Pittsburgh, PA). Inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and expiratory positive airway pressure were 14 and 4 cm H(2)O, respectively. The lung model was set with a respiratory rate of 15 cycles per min and a duration of inspiration of 1 s in three simulated conditions (normal, restrictive, and obstructive). Inspiratory trigger delay and effort, capacity to achieve and maintain IPAP, expiratory cycling and tidal volume were analyzed for all masks and ventilators in the three simulated lung conditions.

Results

The level of intentional leaks in the seven masks ranged from 30 to 45 L/min for an IPAP of 14 cm H(2)O. Importance of leaks did not influence trigger performances. However, capacity to achieve and maintain IPAP was significantly decreased with all ventilators and in all simulated lung conditions when intentional leaks increased. This led to a maximum reduction in delivered tidal volume of 48 mL. Expiratory cycling was not affected by the level of intentional leaks except in obstructive lung conditions.

Conclusion

Mask intentional leaks can impair efficacy of ventilation, especially when > 40 L/min.

### Effect and mechanical mechanism of spontaneous breathing on oxygenation and lung injury in mild or moderate animal ARDS [^415dad32]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Respiratory mechanics

Figure 1 and Table 1 suggest that there was also a comparable mean Paw between the two experimental groups throughout the experiments. The pressure–time curve showed that spontaneous breathing appeared in BIPAP SB group, and spontaneous breathing mainly occurred in low pressure. In BIPAP PC group, there was no spontaneous breathing, which was a typical curve of pressure controlled ventilation. Compared with BIPAP PC, the EMGdi of BIPAP SB group was visible. Due to the diaphragm activity, BIPAP SB group exhibited higher peak P L, Pes, and Pgas and lower mean transpulmonary pressure compared with BIPAP PC. BIPAP PC group had neither diaphragmatic activity nor abdominal muscle activity. As a result, its Peso experienced a positive variation in the inspiratory phase. In addition, After 6 h of modeling, the respiratory rate in BIPAP PC was significantly higher than that in BIPAP SB, but there was no significant difference in tidal volume between the two groups.

BIPAP SB = biphasic positive airway pressure with spontaneous breathing, SB efforts were regained; BIPAP PC = biphasic positive airway pressure with muscles paralysis, Animals' SB efforts were fully depressed. Therefore, BIPAP was equal to pressure-controlled ventilation

EELV

Figure 2 A suggests that the EELV decreased after the induction of lung injury, and no difference was detected in these groups at the beginning of the ventilation. After the planned MV strategy was adopted, the experimental groups showed an overt difference in EELV after 8 h of ventilation (P < 0.001). The EELV of BIPAP SB group was higher than that of BIPAP PC group (P < 0.05).

### Effect of average volume-assured pressure support treatment on health-related quality of life in COPD patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure: a randomized trial [^e34c89cd]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

NiPPV initiation

Patients who met inclusion criteria were allocated on a1:1 basis by computer-generated allocation numbering using a random sequence to S/T AVAPS or S/T BiPAP.

Spontaneous/timed -Average volume-assured pressure support (S/T AVAPS):

Ventilatory parameters were initially programmed in the S/T AVAPS mode (Respironics trilogy 202 ventilator, Philips). Initial ventilator settings were: Patient's height in cm, Target alveolar ventilation (Va): adjusted provided that tidal volume is 6–8 ml/kg of ideal body weight (IBW), Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (EPAP):4–8 cmH 2 O, minimum and maximum pressure support (PS): 8–16, Respiratory rate: 15 breath/min. As the operator sets the target tidal volume (ml/kg IBW) and the target minute ventilation, the equivalent target alveolar ventilation is calculated -based on the patient's introduced height using a special formula that calculates dead space ventilation where: Dead Space Ventilation (VD) = 120x(h/175) 2.363. Subtracting the dead space ventilation from the target minute ventilation, alveolar ventilation is obtained and displayed, where: VA = MV-VD.

So, the operator can make sure VA matches the patient's ventilatory demands.

Spontaneous/timed- Bilevel positive airway pressure (S/T BiPAP):

Ventilatory parameters were programmed in S/T BiPAP mode (Respironics trilogy 202 ventilator, Philips), including IPAP at 12 cmH 2 O, and EPAP at 4–8 cmH 2 O. The respiratory rate was set at 15 breaths/min, rise time set at 300–400 ms, and inspiratory time set at a minimum of 0.6 s. IPAP was measured in increments of 2 cmH 2 O according to the discretion of the attending physician.

Supplemented O 2 was added through an adapter circuit close to the facemask to maintain SaO 2 (oxygen saturation) above 90%.

Follow-up

All patients visited the outpatient clinic 3 months (limited assessment) and 6 months (full evaluation) after the NiPPV was initiated and follow-up measurements were performed by one of the investigators, who were not blinded to the allocation sequence. Patients could contact us by telephone whenever they had any questions.

Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) targets and technique in COPD emphasize SpO2 of ≥ 94%, while chronic COPD patients tolerate hypoxia better and an SpO2 of 90% may relieve their symptoms and be adequate; goals include normalization of respiratory rate (decreased tachypnea) and normalization of end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) as a downward trend, though patients with end stage COPD may have chronically elevated EtCO2 as high as 50s–60s so normalization may not be a good target. For patients not previously using NIV, the key is coaching, explanation of the process, and reassurance, and maintaining a continuous mask seal is essential to maximizing the positive impact of PEEP, particularly at higher levels; breaking the circuit or removing the mask should be meticulously avoided. Nebulized medications may be administered through a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) mask, and a specialized T-connector with a spring valve assembly is required to allow maintenance of positive airway pressure.

### Noninvasive ventilation in acute hypoxemic nonhypercapnic respiratory failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7e26cb9c]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

NIV Decreased Hospital Mortality in Hypoxemia Nonhypercapnic Respiratory Failure Patients

Investigators reported hospital mortality in six trials, with no obvious publication bias (Fig. S7, Supplemental Digital Content 10; legend, Supplemental Digital Content 12). Of the 252 patients treated with NIV, 31 (12.3%) died when in the hospital, compared with 62 of the 251 (24.7%) receiving standard oxygen therapies. Evidently, there is significant decrease of hospital mortality in the NIV group (RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.24–0.87; p = 0.02) (Fig. 5). We graded the overall strength of the evidence as moderate (Supplemental Table 3, Supplemental Digital Content 4).

Figure 5.
Hospital mortality in acute hypoxemic nonhypercapnic respiratory failure patients randomized to noninvasive ventilation (NIV) versus standard oxygen therapy. M-H = Mantel-Haenszel.

The subgroup analysis showed that NIV decreased the hospital mortality of patients especially with helmet or 200 mm Hg < P/F ≤ 300 mm Hg but not with face/nasal mask or 100 mm Hg ≤ P/F ≤ 200 mm Hg (Fig. S8, Supplemental Digital Content 11; legend, Supplemental Digital Content 12). The results suggest that mild AHRF patients could benefit from NIV with helmet in reducing the hospital mortality. Similarly, among six RCTs reporting hospital mortality, there is only one research applying BiPAP mode. Therefore, we did not show the results of subgroup analysis according to NIV modes.

### Noninvasive mechanical ventilation with average volume assured pressure support (AVAPS) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypercapnic encephalopathy [^052ae596]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) in patients with acute respiratory failure has been traditionally determined based on clinical assessment and changes in blood gases, with NIV support pressures manually adjusted by an operator. Bilevel positive airway pressure-spontaneous/timed (BiPAP S/T) with average volume assured pressure support (AVAPS) uses a fixed tidal volume that automatically adjusts to a patient's needs. Our study assessed the use of BiPAP S/T with AVAPS in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypercapnic encephalopathy as compared to BiPAP S/T alone, upon immediate arrival in the Emergency-ICU.

Methods

We carried out a prospective interventional match-controlled study in Guayaquil, Ecuador. A total of 22 patients were analyzed. Eleven with COPD exacerbations and hypercapnic encephalopathy with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) < 10 and a pH of 7.25–7.35 were assigned to receive NIV via BiPAP S/T with AVAPS. Eleven patients were selected as paired controls for the initial group by physicians who were unfamiliar with our study, and these patients were administered BiPAP S/T. Arterial blood gases, GCS, vital signs, and ventilatory parameters were then measured and compared between the two groups.

Results

We observed statistically significant differences in favor of the BiPAP S/T + AVAPS group in GCS (P = 0.00001), pCO(2) (P = 0.03) and maximum inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) (P = 0.005), among others. However, no significant differences in terms of length of stay or days on NIV were observed.

Conclusions

BiPAP S/T with AVAPS facilitates rapid recovery of consciousness when compared to traditional BiPAP S/T in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypercapnic encephalopathy.

European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to management of acute HF, ESC 2018 guidelines recommend to consider initiating noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (CPAP, biphasic positive airway pressure) in patients with respiratory distress (respiratory rate > 25 breaths/min, SaO2 < 90%) without hypotension.

### Days spent on non-invasive ventilation support: can it determine when to initiate VV-ECMO? Observational study in a cohort of COVID-19 patients [^78ba17d4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The number of days spent on mechanical ventilation before interventions, such as venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) or steroids, has been used to classify different clinical stages of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This classification tries to differentiate between an early phase, most of the times defined within the first week from endotracheal intubation (ETI) when interventions could potentially change the ARDS evolution, and a late phase, normally more than seven days from ETI when interventions would theoretically be ineffective. This classification, where day 0 is defined by the day of ETI, represents a somewhat historic cohort given that in the past most of the patients with hypoxemic acute respiratory failure (ARF) were not treated with any form of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) prior to ETI.

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the use of NIV for hypoxemic ARF extraordinarily increased, initially due to logistical reasons, but soon after it became a more standard practice with observational reports showing that this NIV approach could be associated with a decrease in mortality (although study designs do not allow inferring causality) especially when compared to that of an early intubation approach. NIV in whatever form it be, high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), or bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP), probably heralds the initial stage of alveolar collapse of ARDS where positive pressure is required to maintain adequate oxygenation. HFNC can be included as a NIV modality but important differences exist in the level of positive pressure that can provide support to reduce the work of breathing and improve oxygenation. Furthermore, important concerns still exist respect to the effect that these pressures may have in the lung specially regarding the patient's self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) hypothesis although no solid scientific data has demonstrated so far that invasive ventilation would be less harmful than NIV, especially when high PEEP is required or recruitment manoeuvres are performed.

### The effect of bi-level positive airway pressure mechanical ventilation on gas exchange during general anaesthesia [^c2c1b91a]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Atelectasis may occur and ventilation-perfusion mismatch may increase during general anaesthesia with neuromuscular paralysis and mechanical ventilation, though preservation of some intermittent muscle contraction might mitigate this process. There is still no ideal manoeuvre to minimize such mismatch or atelectasis. Bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation adjusts to extra breaths and improves gas exchange during recovery of diaphragm function after neuromuscular paralysis. We hypothesize that BiPAP ventilation may limit the development of pulmonary shunt and may improve ventilation-perfusion mismatch when compared with standard IPPV, with or without PEEP when neuromuscular paralysis has been used during surgery.

Methods

Twenty ventilated patients either on BiPAP or IPPV with or without PEEP were studied randomly using the multiple inert gas elimination technique (MIGET) at 60 and 120 min after rocuronium at induction and after 60 min. Non-invasive cardiac output (NICO) monitoring and plasma concentrations of rocuronium were measured. We compared the data of MIGET, gas exchange, haemodynamic variables and pulmonary mechanics measurements between the different ventilatory modes.

Results

Intrapulmonary shunt (blood flow to V(A)/Q < 0.005) did not increase at 60 min of anaesthesia in any of the different ventilation modes compared with the shunt value before anaesthesia. Log standard deviation of perfusion increased in IPPV, with and without PEEP groups, compared with the baseline (P < 0.05) but did not increase in the BiPAP group. BiPAP ventilation generated a higher level of Pa(O2)than IPPV with or without PEEP (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

BiPAP ventilation was beneficial in decreasing ventilation-perfusion mismatch and improving oxygenation when compared with conventional IPPV (with or without PEEP).

### Stress response during weaning after cardiac surgery [^c92088ff]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

We compared the effects of weaning using synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) with the use of biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) on the stress response, oxygen uptake (VO2) and work of breathing (WOB) in 10 patients after aortocoronary bypass surgery. All three ventilatory settings were investigated in each patient, for example, volume-controlled mechanical ventilation immediately before weaning was followed, in randomized order, by both SIMV and BIPAP. In addition to routine monitoring of continuous and respiratory state, we measured VO2, WOB, and pressure-time product (PTP) as well as the plasma concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine, ACTH, cortisol, vasopressin, and prolactin. Although respiratory rate (f), WOB and PTP were greater with both SIMV and BIPAP when compared with control, other variables did not change with the ventilatory mode. In conclusion, weaning from mechanical ventilation using partial support modes does not affect the postoperative stress response in patients who have had uncomplicated cardiac surgery.

### Effect of spontaneous breathing on ventilator-induced lung injury in mechanically ventilated healthy rabbits: a randomized, controlled, experimental study [^45c2d294]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Figure 2
Representative recordings of airway pressure (Paw), flow and volume (Vol) in experimental groups. The upper panel (A) shows that the animal has no spontaneous breathing, the BIPAP is equal to PCV. The mechanical RR was 37 breaths/minute, and the Pmean was 5 cmH 2 O. The lower panel (B) shows that non-supported spontaneous breathings (black arrows) were possible during each phase of the ventilatory cycle. The mechanical RR was set at 30 breaths/minute, total RR was 40 breaths/min and the Pmean was also 5 cmH 2 O. A and B had equal I:E ratio (1:1), P I (8 cmH 2 O) and PEEP (2 cmH 2 O). BIPAP, biphasic positive airway pressure; I:E, inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio; PCV, pressure control ventilation; PEEP, positive end-expiration pressure; P I, inspiratory pressure; Pmean, mean airway pressure; RR, respiratory rate.

Mean airway pressure (Pmean) for the BIPAP mode can be calculated by:

Here, T I is the length of time for which P I is maintained; T E is the length of time during which PEEP is held. If the ratio of T I to T E is fixed at 1:1, then the Pmean could be kept constant when we changed the cycle frequency from P I to PEEP (or RR). Using this to adjust ventilator parameters (detailed above), we could keep the level of ventilatory support (Pmean) comparable between SB group and CV group of rabbits in our study. Thereafter, the sole difference between the SB group and CV group was whether or not the animals had their spontaneous breathing preserved (Figure 2).
