## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of chronic diarrhea of about one month's duration with no other symptoms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this meets the formal definition of chronic diarrhea and how to categorize it to narrow the differential. Then, I should verify how the absence of alarm or associated symptoms shifts the likelihood among watery, fatty, and inflammatory pathways. Next, I will outline the most likely etiologies, map them to an initial, cost-conscious workup, and specify when to escalate to endoscopy. Finally, I need to consider epidemiologic clues, medication/diet review, and provide a pragmatic, stepwise plan while highlighting red flags and follow-up checkpoints.

> Let me first confirm the definition and diagnostic framework. A one-month history of loose stools meets the standard definition of chronic diarrhea, which is more than four weeks of predominantly loose stool, and the initial approach is to classify diarrhea into watery, fatty/malabsorptive, or inflammatory types to focus testing and management, rather than ordering broad panels indiscriminately [^114bbHKz] [^114oMz7Y].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should apply the "no other symptoms" qualifier carefully. The lack of blood, fever, weight loss, and nocturnal symptoms decreases the probability of inflammatory diarrhea, which typically shows blood/pus and often an elevated fecal calprotectin, whereas the absence of weight loss and steatorrhea argues against classical fatty/malabsorptive states; at the same time, IBS-D requires recurrent abdominal pain by Rome criteria, so painless chronic watery stool favors functional diarrhea over IBS-D proper, although I should confirm this distinction explicitly during history taking [^114oMz7Y] [^114bbHKz] [^114euyFG] [^11194Hy9].

> Next, I will prioritize likely etiologies given chronic watery diarrhea without alarm features. Functional diarrhea is common and presents with painless loose stools, whereas bile acid diarrhea is an underrecognized cause of secretory diarrhea and can present as isolated watery stools; microscopic colitis, particularly in older adults and often women, can also present with painless watery diarrhea and requires colonic biopsies for diagnosis; carbohydrate malabsorption such as lactose or fructose intolerance can cause osmotic diarrhea with minimal systemic features; I must also systematically exclude medication-induced diarrhea, including metformin, PPIs, NSAIDs, SSRIs, magnesium-containing agents, and orlistat, by a detailed medication and supplement history [^113TcerE] [^115S6gyK] [^114bbHKz] [^113uFvCT] [^114oMz7Y].

> Wait, let me verify that I'm not missing "must-test" entities despite few symptoms. Celiac disease can be subtle and may present with isolated diarrhea, so serologic screening with anti-tTG IgA plus total IgA is low burden and guideline-supported; Giardia is a classic infectious cause of persistent or chronic diarrhea, and testing is recommended when epidemiologic risk exists such as travel, camping, or unsafe water exposures; these remain on my radar even if other symptoms are absent [^114bbHKz] [^114oMz7Y] [^115S6gyK].

> I need to check the initial evaluation elements I should not skip. A targeted history and exam with attention to stool form, frequency, nocturnal symptoms, fecal urgency, incontinence, diet, supplements, laxatives, alcohol/sugar alcohols, prior surgeries including cholecystectomy, radiation, and travel will refine pretest probabilities; basic labs such as CBC, CRP, and a basic metabolic panel help screen for inflammation and assess fluid–electrolyte impact; a positive diagnostic approach includes celiac serology up front, and stool testing to classify the diarrhea and exclude key mimics such as fecal calprotectin/FIT to screen for inflammation and Giardia antigen or NAAT where appropriate; when mechanisms are unclear, stool electrolytes/osmolality can calculate osmotic gap and a laxative screen can uncover covert laxative use [^114bbHKz] [^113Y3eya] [^114bbHKz] [^115S6gyK] [^115S6gyK].

> Let me think about how to operationalize testing for the high-yield differentials. For suspected bile acid diarrhea, I should either arrange specific testing where available or consider a therapeutic trial in the right clinical context, recognizing that secretory patterns such as persistence during fasting and at night, and a low stool osmotic gap, support the diagnosis; for microscopic colitis, I should plan colonoscopy with random colonic biopsies even if the mucosa looks normal; for carbohydrate malabsorption, I can use hydrogen breath tests where available or a supervised dietary elimination trial as a pragmatic first step; for Giardia, I should order antigen or NAAT based on risk [^115S6gyK] [^114bbHKz] [^114oMz7Y].

> But wait, what if my initial low-risk assessment is off and there are hidden red flags. I should double-check age of onset, nocturnal diarrhea, progressive course, unintentional weight loss, family history of IBD, celiac disease, or colorectal cancer, overt or occult blood, and iron deficiency; if any are present or if symptoms persist despite a focused initial workup, colonoscopy is indicated, with random biopsies to exclude microscopic colitis, and if malabsorption remains suspected after a negative colonoscopy, upper endoscopy with small bowel biopsies is reasonable to evaluate for small bowel causes including celiac disease [^111FZHZu] [^114oMz7Y] [^117Kv6jL].

> I should confirm how epidemiology and host factors influence next steps. In those with recent travel or untreated water exposures, persistent diarrhea of 14 days or more warrants evaluation for intestinal parasitic infections including Giardia; in patients recently treated with antibiotics, I need to consider C. difficile and test accordingly; in immunocompromised hosts, the diagnostic net must be broader for bacterial, viral, and parasitic etiologies and tailored to the immune deficit [^1157vCiZ] [^111uVqXE] [^117EkoVu] [^1152cwfm].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially downplayed malabsorption, but I should verify exceptions. Celiac disease can indeed present without weight loss, so serology remains appropriate even when "no other symptoms" are reported; exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is less likely without steatorrhea or weight loss, but if there are suggestive features or risk factors, fecal elastase-1 can help exclude it in low-probability settings, acknowledging false positives in watery stool and the need to interpret results cautiously [^1113botT] [^1111k6ce].

> I will now examine a pragmatic, stepwise plan. First, confirm chronicity and characterize the syndrome with history, exam, and limited labs including CBC, CRP, BMP, tTG IgA and total IgA; second, perform focused stool testing to categorize mechanism and exclude inflammation and Giardia as indicated, reserving osmotic gap and laxative screen for unclear cases; third, address modifiable contributors by stopping culprit medications and trialing dietary eliminations for lactose/fructose; fourth, if watery diarrhea persists without alarm features, consider evaluation for bile acid diarrhea and proceed to colonoscopy with biopsies to exclude microscopic colitis if symptoms persist or risk is high; finally, escalate to upper endoscopy with biopsies when malabsorption remains suspected despite negative colonoscopy, and ensure timely follow-up to reassess symptoms, recheck for red flags, and adapt the plan accordingly [^114bbHKz] [^115S6gyK] [^113Y3eya] [^114oMz7Y] [^117Kv6jL].

For a patient with **1 month of diarrhea and no other symptoms** [^115jhZxm], the most likely causes are **functional disorders (IBS-D, functional diarrhea)** [^1165zVuo] [^114bbHKz], **medication-induced diarrhea** [^114oMz7Y], and **chronic infections (Giardia, Cryptosporidium, C. difficile)** [^116EKPyj] [^1135EwHG]. Less common causes include **malabsorption syndromes (celiac, lactose intolerance, SIBO)** [^114bbHKz], **microscopic colitis** [^114oMz7Y], and **bile acid diarrhea** [^111FZHZu]. Initial evaluation should include a detailed **history and physical** [^116YLzzu], basic labs (CBC, CMP, TSH, celiac serology) [^113Y3eya] [^1113botT], and targeted **stool studies** (Giardia antigen, C. difficile, fecal calprotectin) [^115S6gyK]. Many cases are benign or self-limited, but **persistent symptoms or alarm features** warrant further workup [^112tmtT6] [^113pABJn].

---

## Functional gastrointestinal disorders

Functional disorders are the **most common cause** of chronic diarrhea without other symptoms [^113TcerE]. Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (**IBS-D**) presents with chronic diarrhea and abdominal discomfort relieved by defecation, often triggered by stress or diet [^1154nfs3]. Functional diarrhea is **chronic watery diarrhea** without abdominal pain or other systemic symptoms and may also be influenced by stress or diet [^114bbHKz].

---

## Medication-induced diarrhea

Medications are a **frequent cause** of chronic diarrhea without other symptoms [^113Y3eya]:

- **Antibiotics**: Can cause antibiotic-associated diarrhea, including C. difficile infection [^114oMz7Y].

- **Laxatives**: Chronic use or abuse can cause osmotic diarrhea [^114oMz7Y].

- **Metformin**: Commonly causes gastrointestinal side effects, including diarrhea [^113Y3eya].

- **Magnesium-containing antacids**: Can cause osmotic diarrhea [^114bbHKz].

- **Chemotherapeutic agents**: Such as irinotecan, can cause chronic diarrhea.

---

## Chronic infections

Chronic infections can cause **persistent diarrhea** without other systemic symptoms [^116EKPyj]:

- **Giardia lamblia**: Common cause of chronic diarrhea, especially in travelers or those with contaminated water exposure [^1127bbtn].

- **Cryptosporidium**: Particularly in immunocompromised patients [^1127bbtn] [^113ncMxf].

- **Clostridioides difficile**: Can cause chronic diarrhea, especially after antibiotic use [^114oMz7Y] [^1135EwHG].

---

## Malabsorption syndromes

Malabsorption syndromes can present with **chronic diarrhea** without other prominent symptoms [^113Y3eya]. Causes include celiac disease — a gluten-sensitive enteropathy that may cause chronic diarrhea with subtle nutritional deficiencies [^1113botT]; lactose intolerance — commonly causing diarrhea after dairy consumption [^114bbHKz]; and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), which causes diarrhea via bacterial fermentation and malabsorption [^114euyFG].

---

## Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)

IBD can occasionally present with **chronic diarrhea** without other prominent symptoms, although it is typically associated with abdominal pain, weight loss, or blood in stool [^1154qKqL]. Microscopic colitis presents with **chronic watery diarrhea** without abdominal pain or systemic symptoms and is more common in older adults [^114oMz7Y] [^111FZHZu]. Mild **Crohn's disease** or **ulcerative colitis** may also initially present with diarrhea alone [^1154qKqL].

---

## Endocrine disorders

Endocrine disorders can cause **chronic diarrhea** without other prominent symptoms [^114bbHKz]. Mechanisms include hyperthyroidism, which increases bowel motility [^114oMz7Y], and diabetic autonomic neuropathy [^114oMz7Y]; carcinoid syndrome may also present with chronic diarrhea in the absence of other symptoms [^116qUL8F].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A systematic diagnostic approach is **essential**:

- **Detailed history and physical examination**: Identify dietary triggers, medication use, travel history, and family history of gastrointestinal diseases [^116YLzzu].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, CMP, TSH, celiac serology, stool studies for Giardia, Cryptosporidium, C. difficile, fecal calprotectin [^113Y3eya] [^1113botT] [^115S6gyK].

- **Imaging and endoscopy**: Consider colonoscopy with biopsies if microscopic colitis or IBD suspected; upper endoscopy with duodenal biopsies if celiac disease suspected [^111FZHZu] [^117Kv6jL].

---

## Conclusion

Chronic diarrhea lasting one month without other symptoms is **most commonly due to** functional gastrointestinal disorders, medication-induced diarrhea, or chronic infections [^1165zVuo]. A systematic diagnostic approach — including detailed history, laboratory tests, and targeted imaging or endoscopy — helps identify the **underlying cause** and guide appropriate **management** [^113Y3eya] [^112tmtT6].

### Evaluation of chronic diarrhea [^114oMz7Y]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhea, defined as a decrease in stool consistency for more than four weeks, is a common but challenging clinical scenario. It can be divided into three basic categories: watery, fatty (malabsorption), and inflammatory.

- **Watery diarrhea**: Watery diarrhea may be subdivided into osmotic, secretory, and functional types. Watery diarrhea includes irritable bowel syndrome, which is the most common cause of functional diarrhea. Another example of watery diarrhea is microscopic colitis, which is a secretory diarrhea affecting older persons. Laxative-induced diarrhea is often osmotic.

- **Malabsorptive diarrhea**: Malabsorptive diarrhea is characterized by excess gas, steatorrhea, or weight loss; giardiasis is a classic infectious example. Celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy) is also malabsorptive and typically results in weight loss and iron deficiency anemia.

- **Inflammatory diarrhea**: Inflammatory diarrhea, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease, is characterized by blood and pus in the stool and an elevated fecal calprotectin level. Invasive bacteria and parasites also produce inflammation. Infections caused by Clostridium difficile subsequent to antibiotic use have become increasingly common and virulent.

Not all chronic diarrhea is strictly watery, malabsorptive, or inflammatory, as some categories overlap. Still, the most practical diagnostic approach is to attempt to categorize the diarrhea by type before testing and treating. This narrows the list of diagnostic possibilities and reduces unnecessary testing. Empiric therapy is justified when a specific diagnosis is strongly suspected and follow-up is available.

### Chronic diarrhea in adults: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^114bbHKz]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhea is defined as predominantly loose stool lasting longer than four weeks. A patient's history and physical examination, along with a complete blood count, C-reactive protein, anti-tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A (IgA), total IgA, and a basic metabolic panel, are useful for evaluating pathologies such as celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease. More targeted testing should be based on the differential diagnosis.

When the differential diagnosis is broad, stool studies should be used to categorize diarrhea as watery, fatty, or inflammatory. Some disorders can cause more than one type of diarrhea. Watery diarrhea includes secretory, osmotic, and functional types. Functional disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome and functional diarrhea are common causes of chronic diarrhea. Secretory diarrhea can be caused by bile acid malabsorption, microscopic colitis, endocrine disorders, and some postsurgical states. Osmotic diarrhea can present with carbohydrate malabsorption syndromes and laxative abuse. Fatty diarrhea can be caused by malabsorption or maldigestion and includes disorders such as celiac disease, giardiasis, and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Inflammatory diarrhea warrants further evaluation and can be caused by disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, Clostridioides difficile colitis, and colorectal cancer.

### Comparison of symptoms, healthcare utilization, and treatment in diagnosed and undiagnosed individuals with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome [^11194Hy9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterized by chronic symptoms of abdominal pain associated with altered bowel function, such as pain related to defecation, changes in stool frequency, or appearance. Additional symptoms of IBS may include straining, fecal urgency, and bloating. IBS can further be subdivided by stool consistency into constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C), diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), or mixed bowel habit pattern (IBS-M). Importantly, patients with IBS report reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL) compared with individuals without IBS.

As many as 48 million individuals in the United States are thought to be affected by IBS annually, yet up to 75% of patients with IBS may lack a formal medical diagnosis. Although diagnostic symptom criteria exist for IBS, they are mainly used in clinical research studies rather than routinely in clinical practice. In a US study using a large health insurance database, patients with IBS were most likely to receive a diagnosis from an internist (68%) rather than a gastroenterologist (13%). Hungin et al. conducted a European study that surveyed 3,880 participants with IBS symptoms and suggested that primary care physicians may have an even greater role in IBS diagnosis and management; the authors found that most patients with medically diagnosed IBS sought medical care from primary care physicians (90%) rather than gastroenterologists (28%). Of symptomatic individuals lacking a medical diagnosis, Hungin et al. found, for a European sample, a similar trend.

Regarding medical management for traveler's diarrhea, specifically in relation to antibiotic therapy and the choice of agent, the ISTM 2017 guidelines recommend considering the administration of any of the following antibiotics for treating patients with moderate traveler's diarrhea:

- **Fluoroquinolones**: A broad-spectrum antibiotic class often used for its effectiveness against a variety of bacteria.

- **Azithromycin**: An antibiotic that is particularly effective for patients traveling to regions with prevalent resistant strains.

- **Rifaximin**: A non-systemic antibiotic primarily used for its targeted action within the gastrointestinal tract.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British Society of Gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^116YLzzu]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The initial assessment of patients with chronic diarrhoea can be mostly carried out in the primary care setting. The importance of careful history taking and examination cannot be overemphasized.

- **Initial presentation in primary care**: In most countries where there is a split primary/secondary care system, the first consultation is with the primary care physician. Around 10% of all consultations in primary care are for gastroenterological problems, of which half are for lower gastrointestinal (GI) problems. Most of these are for self-limiting symptoms or for functional GI disorders, and only a very small proportion comprise chronic or persistent diarrhoea. Based on the accepted definition of chronic diarrhoea being abnormal passage of ≥ 3 loose stools per day for more than 4 weeks and a rate of 3–5% per year, a primary care physician with an average list size of 1700 patients may have 50–85 such patients each year. Only a proportion of these will consult, with many managing with self- or pharmacy-based treatments, while others will be managed within primary care, often with antidiarrhoeals.

No data are available on the proportion referred to secondary care, but these are likely to be a small minority of the total number of people with chronic diarrhoea in the community. First-line investigations are normally performed within primary care, and patients may be referred if their condition causes interference with normal activities or a compromise of quality of life sufficient to warrant further action.

### When and what to test for diarrhea: Focus on stool testing [^115S6gyK]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

To review stool diagnostic tests in acute and chronic diarrhea.

- **Methods**: Narrative review of published literature.

- **Results**: In acute diarrhea, stool tests are indicated when there is a strong pretest probability of infectious etiology or Clostridioides difficile infection, suggested by more than three unformed bowel movements per 24 hours, symptoms lasting over seven days, and circumstances that are suggestive of infection. Several commercially available rapid tests for bacterial, viral, or protozoal infections may be offered in addition to traditional methods (e.g. culture, microscopy) and provide a result within six hours. For C. difficile infections, a highly sensitive test, such as the glutamate dehydrogenase test, is required; however, this does not distinguish infection from a carrier state. That differentiation requires specialized nucleic acid amplification test (for toxin B) or enzyme immunoassays for toxin A or B, which are unfortunately not generally offered by microbiology laboratories.

Chronic diarrhea may result from inflammatory, fatty, osmotic, or secretory causes; the most common cause is diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome/functional diarrhea. Recommendations in societal guidelines or clinical practice updates regarding stool tests in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome/functional diarrhea, in the absence of alarm symptoms, include testing for Giardia, calprotectin, fecal immunochemical test, and bile acid diarrhea. Comprehensive stool biochemical analyses (osmolality, pH, electrolytes) differentiate osmotic from secretory diarrhea and identify laxative-induced causes.

### Nosocomial diarrhea: Evaluation and treatment of causes other than Clostridium difficile [^114n2PYM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Diarrhea is common among hospitalized patients, but the causes are distinct from those of diarrhea in the community. We review existing data about the epidemiology of nosocomial diarrhea and summarize recent progress in understanding the mechanisms of diarrhea. Clinicians should recognize that most cases of nosocomial diarrhea have a noninfectious etiology, including medications, underlying illness, and enteral feeding. Apart from Clostridium difficile, the frequency of infectious causes such as norovirus and toxigenic strains of Clostridium perfringens, Klebsiella oxytoca, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacteroides fragilis remains largely undefined, and test availability is limited. Here, we provide a practical approach to the evaluation and management of nosocomial diarrhea when tests for C. difficile are negative.

### Chronic diarrhea: Diagnosis and management [^113uFvCT]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhea is a common issue affecting up to 5% of the population at any given time. Patients define diarrhea by symptoms such as loose stool consistency, increased frequency, urgency of bowel movements, or incontinence. Physicians typically use increased frequency of defecation or increased stool weight as major criteria, distinguishing acute diarrhea, which is often due to self-limited infections, from chronic diarrhea based on symptom duration, with a 4-week period often used as a cutoff. Symptom clusters and settings can aid in assessing the likelihood of specific causes of diarrhea.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can be differentiated from other causes of chronic diarrhea by pain that peaks before defecation, is relieved by defecation, and is associated with changes in stool form or frequency, as per the Rome criteria. Evaluation is usually necessary for patients with chronic diarrhea, although in some cases, a detailed history and physical examination may suffice to direct therapy. Factors such as diet, medications, and prior surgery or radiation therapy can often be suspected from history alone.

Testing is indicated when alarm features are present, when no obvious cause is evident, or when further differentiation of the diagnosis is required. Blood and stool testing, endoscopy, imaging studies, histology, and physiological testing all play roles, though not all are necessary for every patient. Categorizing patients after initial limited testing may facilitate more targeted testing and management.

### Chronic diarrhea: Diagnosis and management [^112tmtT6]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic diarrhea, specifically in the context of initial evaluation, CD-EG 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining testing in the presence of alarm features when the differential diagnosis can be effectively distinguished based on test results, or when the differential diagnosis remains broad and initial testing will limit the number of additional tests needed. Consider offering a therapeutic trial for disorders without definitive diagnostic tests.

### Differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea: An algorithm to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea from other organic gastrointestinal diseases, with special focus on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^114euyFG]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is categorized into one of four subtypes according to the predominant stool pattern: IBS-D (irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea), IBS with constipation, IBS with a mix of both diarrhea and constipation, or IBS unclassified. Of these, IBS-D has the highest prevalence, affecting up to 40% of adults diagnosed with IBS. Internationally, 1.2% of individuals experience IBS-D, and, like IBS overall, there is a slight preponderance of females compared with males (1.3% vs. 1.0%).

Patients with IBS-D pass Bristol Stool Form Scale type 6 or type 7 stools (loose, mushy, watery) during more than 25% of bowel movements and types 1 and 2 stools (hard, lumpy, pellet-like) less than 25% of the time. Rome IV diagnostic criteria specify that stool texture should be assessed on days with abdominal pain to enable greater precision in differentiating the IBS subtype.

Because the symptoms of IBS-D may overlap with those of other conditions — such as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), celiac disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, disaccharidase deficiencies, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and infections — diagnosis is not always straightforward. However, the initial classification of diarrhea as watery (indicative of IBS), fatty or greasy (indicative of EPI), or inflammatory (indicative of inflammatory bowel disease) can begin to narrow the differential diagnosis.

### Differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea: An algorithm to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea from other organic gastrointestinal diseases, with special focus on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^112Rbjc6]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is the most common cause of diarrhea in the developed world, with an estimated prevalence in the United States of 4% to 9%, based on Rome III/IV criteria. Although patients can present with IBS at any age, it is most common in women aged 20 to 40 years, with women being diagnosed about twice as often as men (14% vs. 8.9%).

According to Rome IV clinical criteria, IBS may be diagnosed if abdominal pain is present at least 1 day per week, is associated with changes in visceral perception with defecation and/or alterations in stool form/frequency, and the symptoms affect patients' quality of life or their abilities to carry out normal activities of daily living. While these clinical criteria do not require symptoms to be present for a specific period of time, the practitioner must be confident that other diagnoses have been appropriately excluded. The Rome IV research-based criteria are more stringent, requiring symptoms to be present for the previous 3 months with onset more than 6 months before diagnosis.

Symptoms not included in the definition of IBS-D, but commonly identified at presentation, include abdominal bloating and/or distension, fecal urgency, sensations of incomplete evacuation, and the passage of mucus in stools. Stools are characteristically watery (Bristol Stool Form Scale 6–7) and typically passed during waking hours. Stress is a well-known mediator. Importantly, the development of symptoms in those older than 50 years, unintentional weight loss, and acute unexplained symptom changes should raise concerns of potential bleeding and/or anemia.

### Infectious diarrhea in developed and developing countries [^116nboPy]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Diarrhea from gastrointestinal infection remains a common problem. In industrialized countries, management is aimed at reducing morbidity and defining groups that may benefit from further investigation. Most infectious diarrhea is self-limiting and only requires supportive management. Viral agents are increasingly recognized as causative agents of epidemic and sporadic diarrhea.

In developing countries, diarrhea is a major cause of mortality in children. Oral rehydration therapy, guided by a clinical assessment of the degree of dehydration, is cheap, simple, and effective, and remains the mainstay of management of infant diarrhea. Controversies focus on the optimal formulation of oral rehydration solution. A vaccine against rotavirus has the potential to save millions of lives worldwide.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British Society of Gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^114CnLju]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Difficulties in establishing guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea arise due to the overlap in reported symptoms between irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and true diarrhoea. A reported change in stool frequency or form is characteristic of IBS, forming part of its definition, which relies on symptom-based criteria and negative physical examination. Although stool weight does not usually increase in IBS, as diagnosis is based on symptom reporting and stool weight is rarely assessed early, considerable overlap between functional bowel disease and true diarrhoea can occur. As IBS may affect 10–13% of the population, there is a substantial potential for inappropriate investigation of patients reporting diarrhoeal symptoms. Conversely, new onset diarrhoea may indicate serious organic diseases, such as colonic neoplasia. The broad diagnostic potential given similar reported symptoms makes it challenging to introduce specific guidelines.

The wide range of conditions leading to diarrhoea also complicates establishing prescriptive investigative pathways. Diarrhoea may result from colonic neoplasia, inflammation, small bowel inflammation, small bowel malabsorption, maldigestion due to pancreatic insufficiency, or motility disorders. It can be difficult to differentiate these on clinical grounds alone. The decision on whether to focus investigations on any of these areas remains largely a matter of clinical judgment, although, as will be discussed, the prevalence and potential seriousness of each condition must be considered.

### Ofev [^111sCbu8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Diarrhea was the most frequent gastrointestinal event reported in clinical trials. In most patients, this event was of mild to moderate intensity and occurred within the first three months of treatment.

- **IPF studies**: Diarrhea was reported in 62% of patients treated with Ofev compared to 18% of those given a placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. It led to a permanent dose reduction in 11% of patients on Ofev, while no placebo-treated patients required such reductions. Moreover, Ofev was discontinued due to diarrhea in 5% of patients versus less than 1% of those on a placebo.

- **Chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype study**: Diarrhea was seen in 67% of patients receiving Ofev, compared to 24% on a placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. As a result, 16% of Ofev patients needed a permanent dose reduction, compared to less than 1% of placebo patients. Discontinuation due to diarrhea occurred in 6% of patients with Ofev versus less than 1% with a placebo.

- **SSc-ILD study**: Diarrhea affected 76% of Ofev patients and 32% of those on a placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. This condition led to a permanent dose reduction in 22% of Ofev patients, in contrast to 1% of placebo participants. Additionally, 7% of Ofev patients discontinued treatment due to diarrhea, compared to just 0.3% of those receiving a placebo.

Dosage modifications or treatment interruptions might be necessary for patients with adverse reactions of diarrhea. It is advisable to treat diarrhea at the first sign.

### Management of diarrhea in patients with carcinoid syndrome [^116qUL8F]. Pancreas (2019). Low credibility.

In assessing a patient with suspected carcinoid syndrome (CS) diarrhea, it is important to differentiate the gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) from the diarrhea, abdominal pain, and dyspepsia related to other causes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome). This can be achieved by eliciting a thorough patient history that details age, sleep patterns, and nonspecific symptoms. Unfortunately, the literature on the differential diagnosis of CS diarrhea is limited. Diarrhea in patients with NETs is secretory and typically causes large-volume stools, with no osmotic gap between serum and stool, compared to malabsorptive diarrhea in other GI diseases. It may disturb sleep and is associated with bleeding, fever, weight loss, and persistent severe pain. Other causes of secretory diarrhea (e.g. bile acid-induced diarrhea, medications, infections, and metabolic causes, including diabetes mellitus) should be ruled out. Inquiry about ingested laxatives and osmotic agents, such as fructose and artificial sweeteners, which are common contributors to diarrhea in general, is important.

Diarrhea associated with carcinoid syndrome tends to be watery after the first one or two movements. The frequency of bowel movements can range from two to five in a day to more than 20, which can be extremely debilitating and deleterious to quality of life (QoL). The presence of watery diarrhea, in association with cutaneous facial flushing (especially when associated with evidence of elevated serotonin blood levels) and radiographic evidence of malignancy is almost always indicative of carcinoid syndrome.

### Differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea: An algorithm to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea from other organic gastrointestinal diseases, with special focus on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^116Si5YT]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Early and accurate diagnosis is essential in disease management. A patient with chronic diarrhea may present with a spectrum of symptoms indicating one of several disorders, including IBS-D, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), celiac disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, inflammatory bowel disease, and infections (e.g. giardiasis). All of these conditions may include diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and flatulence among their symptoms. To assist in the accurate diagnosis of patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, we suggest a four-step diagnostic process.

- **Step 1: Thorough history and physical examination**: Diagnosis should begin by taking a thorough history and physical examination. Patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, defined as persisting for ≥ 4 weeks, should be questioned in detail on their symptoms and prior diarrhea history. Although the clinical definition of diarrhea is loose or watery stools ≥ 3 times in a 24-hour period, patients use various definitions (e.g. loose stools, increased stool frequency, or fecal urgency), underscoring the importance of an accurate and detailed patient history. Abnormal stool form can be more important in defining diarrhea because patients with functional constipation will also present with a chief complaint of diarrhea due to increased defecatory frequency. However, further questioning may reveal symptoms of straining, incomplete evacuation, obstruction, and the passage of hard stools.

As an initial approach, we recommend determining if diarrhea can be categorized as watery.

Options for therapy are not discussed, as they are beyond the remit of this guideline. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of investigations has not been addressed due to a paucity of available evidence.

If infectious etiologies are not taken into account and Mytesi is given based on a presumptive non-infectious diarrhea diagnosis, there is a risk that patients with infectious causes will not receive appropriate treatment, potentially leading to a worsening of their condition. It is important to note that Mytesi is not indicated for treating infectious diarrhea.

### Diarrhea in nontravelers: Risk and etiology [^117MTzRV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Acute diarrheal illnesses in nontravelers are common and represent a significant health and economic burden in the United States and other developed countries. The likelihood of experiencing diarrhea increases manyfold during travel to developing countries. There is extensive overlap in the pathogens that cause diarrhea in both travelers and nontravelers. However, the proportions differ and vary by geographic area and season, and they change over time. Rates of infection are highest in infants and young children, in whom viral pathogens predominate. Person-to-person transmission may account for more than one-half of cases.

In contrast, many studies show that bacterial infections predominate in travelers, who often acquire infections from contaminated food and water. Due to the globalization of the food supply, clinicians in developed countries should expect to continue seeing sporadic cases and outbreaks of diarrhea caused by unusual pathogens, such as Cyclospora species.

### Estimates of the global, regional, and national morbidity, mortality, and aetiologies of diarrhoea in 195 countries: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 [^1142rySx]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

The attribution of 13 diarrhoeal aetiologies, identified as those significantly associated with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study, was estimated separately from mortality and morbidity. The majority of diarrhoeal aetiologies were attributed using a counterfactual approach called a population attributable fraction (PAF). Our approach accounted for pathogen co-detection and detection in healthy individuals and does not necessitate a one pathogen to one episode association.

PAF is defined as the product of the modeled proportion of pathogen detection in diarrhoea samples based on a molecular diagnostic case definition and the odds ratio (OR) of diarrhoea given the detection of a pathogen. ORs are based on molecular diagnostic results from the Global Enteric Multicenter Study. By contrast with previous rounds of GBD that followed the Global Enteric Multicenter Study age groups, for GBD 2016, we defined ORs for children younger than 1 year and all age groups older than 1 year. This approach makes these ORs consistent with the GBD age groups and adds power to the ORs of 1–5 years that are applied to all age groups older than 5 years.

The proportion estimates are from DisMod models and their input data from scientific literature and are modeled for each age, sex, year, and location. The input data for these models, including meta-data about the sources, age groups, and types of diagnostics, are provided in the appendix (pp 3–37). The number of episodes and deaths attributable to each aetiology is the product of the total number of diarrhoea episodes.

### Telepro: Patient-reported carcinoid syndrome symptom improvement following initiation of telotristat ethyl in the real world [^111hUaG6]. The Oncologist (2019). Low credibility.

When carcinoid syndrome (CS) diarrhea (CSD) is inadequately controlled with long-acting somatostatin analogs (SSAs), clinical practice guidelines recommend the addition of the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor, telotristat ethyl (TE). In a 12-week multinational, randomized controlled trial, TE added to SSA reduced peripheral serotonin and the frequency of CSD. We evaluated the real-world effectiveness of TE using patient-reported data from a nurse support program over 3 months.

- **Materials and methods**: This study used a deidentified data set of patients initiating TE who opted into a nurse support program between March and November 2017 and reported CS symptom burden at baseline and at least one follow-up time point at months 1, 2, and 3. Patients reported demographic and medical history information as well as the frequency of bowel movements (BMs) and flushing episodes, severity of nausea, urgency, and abdominal pain (0 "no/not at all" to 100 "worst imaginable/very urgent"), and stool form (1 "very hard" to 10 "watery"). Mean changes from baseline in CS symptom burden were reported using paired-sample t tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.

- **Results**: Most patients initiating TE enrolled in the nurse program (791/898, 88%), of whom 369 (47%) were included in the analysis. Patients treated with TE reported significant reductions in CSD and other CS symptoms (all p < .001). At least half of the patients treated with TE experienced ≥ 30% improvement from baseline in BM frequency and an average reduction of at least two BMs per day within 3 months.

- **Conclusion**: Patients taking SSA therapy…

### Differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea: An algorithm to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea from other organic gastrointestinal diseases, with special focus on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^113PgTcj]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Chronic diarrhea, defined as diarrhea persisting for more than four weeks, affects up to 5% of the population regardless of age, sex, race, or socioeconomic status. The impact on patient health and quality of life is substantial, and the diagnosis and management of these patients have significant economic consequences for health care services. The differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea is broad, with etiologies including infections, endocrinopathies, maldigestive/malabsorptive conditions, and disorders of gut-brain interaction. The considerable overlap of symptoms across this spectrum makes accurate diagnosis problematic, potentially leading to delays in diagnosis or misdiagnosis.

In this narrative review, we consider the differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea, focusing on irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. These two conditions may present similarly but have very different underlying causes and require significantly different management strategies. We outline a four-step diagnostic strategy and propose a straightforward algorithm to assist in efficiently differentiating irritable bowel syndrome from exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and other causes of chronic diarrhea. We anticipate that these aids will improve diagnostic accuracy, which ultimately should lead to improvements in patients' health-related quality of life and reduce the societal burden on health care services.

### Differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea: An algorithm to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea from other organic gastrointestinal diseases, with special focus on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^112fbfUi]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

- **Step 2: Identify risk factors, iatrogenic factors, and previous diagnoses**: To rule out extrinsic risk factors as the cause of chronic diarrhea, it is important to establish if the patient has recently traveled (to regions with recognized specific diarrhea-related pathogens, such as Giardia), has undergone gastrointestinal surgery (e.g. gall bladder removal, ileocecal resection, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass), received radiation treatment, or is taking medication that may induce diarrhea. In addition, the presence of mucosal (e.g. celiac disease), hepatic, pancreaticobiliary, neoplastic, or systemic (endocrine, vascular, or immunologic) disease may indicate an increased risk for diarrhea development.

- **Step 3: Rule out alarm features**: Several clinical features suggest the presence of a more serious disease. For this reason, it is important to rule out any of the following: recent onset, especially among older patients; nocturnal diarrhea; severe or progressively worsening symptoms; unexplained weight loss; a family history of gastroenterological or systemic disease, such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or colorectal cancer; the presence of blood in the stool; and unexplained iron deficiency.

- **Step 4: Initial laboratory workup**: The history and physical examination should guide the diagnostic strategy. If alarm signs or symptoms are present, testing should be based on the most likely etiologic causes. For example, in individuals presenting with chronic meal-related fatty–greasy diarrhea in association with weight loss and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, a workup for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency should be considered.

### Etiology, presentation, and risk factors for diarrheal syndromes in 3 sub-Saharan African countries after the introduction of rotavirus vaccines from the Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) study [^116KVR2C]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

At enrollment, the primary caretaker of each participant underwent a standardized interview to document demographic, epidemiological, and clinical information. Each child's height or length was measured and converted to a height-for-age z-score (HAZ) based on World Health Organization (WHO) standards, with HAZ < −2 indicating stunting. Each case patient provided a fresh stool sample to be assessed for enteropathogens. Treatment data were collected during the child's stay at the sentinel health center and for any prescriptions given for home treatment. A child was considered to have received antibiotics if they were administered at the sentinel health center or if a prescription was provided. Caretakers recorded daily diarrhea (presence or absence) for 14 days onto a memory aid to estimate the duration of diarrhea. Dehydration was categorized according to WHO guidelines. A modified Vesikari score was calculated based on diarrhea and vomiting duration, maximum daily frequency of diarrheal stools and emesis episodes, fever, and the degree of dehydration.

Approximately 60 days after enrollment (range, 50–90 days), fieldworkers visited participants at home to assess the child's vital status and repeat anthropometric measurements. The memory aids were reviewed with the caretaker and collected.

The diarrheal syndromes are defined as follows: (1) acute watery diarrhea (AWD), nonbloody moderate to severe diarrhea (MSD) lasting less than 14 days; (2) persistent watery diarrhea (WD), WD lasting 14 days or more; and (3) bloody diarrhea (dysentery).

### Persistent diarrhea: A clinical review [^116EKPyj]. JAMA (2016). Low credibility.

Diarrheal disease is commonly encountered in clinical practice. Persistent diarrhea (≥ 14 days) can be caused by pathogens that differ from those commonly seen in acute illness; proper etiologic diagnosis is important for appropriate therapeutic management. This review provides an overview of the epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and management of persistent diarrhea caused by infectious agents in immunocompetent individuals worldwide.

Much of the data on persistent diarrhea comes from studies of residents in or expatriates of developing countries and travelers to these regions where follow-up studies have been performed. Persistent diarrhea occurs in approximately 3% of individuals traveling to developing countries. Schistosoma mansoni (and rarely Schistosoma haematobium) intestinal infection is also not very common and is found only in endemic areas. The microbiologic causes of protracted diarrhea include detectable parasitic (e.g. Giardia, Cryptosporidium) and bacterial (e.g. enteroaggregative Escherichia coli, Shigella) pathogens. Available diagnostic tests include culture-dependent methods for bacterial pathogens and culture-independent methods for bacterial, viral, and protozoal infections (e.g. polymerase chain reaction [PCR]), including multiplex PCR and microscopy for protozoal infections. Antimicrobial therapy can be given empirically to patients returning from the undeveloped to the developed world. Otherwise, antibiotics should be given based on the results of laboratory testing.

### Differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea: An algorithm to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea from other organic gastrointestinal diseases, with special focus on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^112o9daJ]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Diarrhea is a common yet complex disorder precipitated by multiple etiologic and pathogenic mechanisms. Distinguishing these conditions from each other can be problematic, especially where symptoms overlap. This is highlighted in individuals with IBS-D: in the United States, up to 75% of patients meeting the criteria remain undiagnosed. This is concerning because IBS is the most common cause of diarrhea and can be diagnosed with high accuracy based on a few simple binary questions and minimal diagnostic testing.

One of the most reported mimickers of IBS-D is EPI, and it is not uncommon for patients with EPI to be misdiagnosed with IBS-D. Consequently, we have proposed an algorithm designed specifically to help distinguish between these two disorders and differentiate them from other etiologies of chronic diarrhea. Most importantly, this algorithm incorporates recommendations from the recently published ACG and AGA IBS guidelines, stressing a positive diagnostic strategy. This simple algorithm should assist practitioners in making timely diagnoses and reduce superfluous testing, thus reducing delays in treatment and improving patient health and quality of life.

### Acute diarrhea in adults [^112XuboH]. American Family Physician (2022). Low credibility.

Acute diarrheal disease accounts for 179 million outpatient visits annually in the United States. Diarrhea can be categorized as inflammatory or noninflammatory, and both types have infectious and noninfectious causes. Infectious noninflammatory diarrhea is often viral in etiology and is the most common presentation; however, bacterial causes are also common and may be related to travel or foodborne illness.

History for patients with acute diarrhea should include the onset and frequency of symptoms, stool character, a focused review of systems including fever and other symptoms, and evaluation of exposures and risk factors. The physical examination should include evaluation for signs of dehydration, sepsis, or potential surgical processes. Most episodes of acute diarrhea in countries with adequate food and water sanitation are uncomplicated and self-limited, requiring only an initial evaluation and supportive treatment.

Additional diagnostic evaluation and management may be warranted when diarrhea is bloody or mucoid, or when risk factors are present, including immunocompromise or recent hospitalization. Unless an outbreak is suspected, molecular studies are preferred over traditional stool cultures. In all cases, management begins with replacing water, electrolytes, and nutrients. Oral rehydration is preferred; however, signs of severe dehydration or sepsis warrant intravenous rehydration. Antidiarrheal agents can be symptomatic therapy for acute watery diarrhea and can help decrease inappropriate antibiotic use. Empiric antibiotics are rarely warranted, except in cases of sepsis.

### Approach to the patient with infectious colitis [^1139YrQz]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

To provide recommendations for the evaluation and treatment of patients with infectious colitis, infectious colitis is diagnosed in someone with diarrhea and one or more of the following: fever and/or dysentery; stools containing inflammatory markers such as leukocytes, lactoferrin, or calprotectin; positive stool culture for an invasive or inflammatory bacterial enteropathogen including Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) or Clostridium difficile; or colonic inflammation identified by endoscopy.

Standard stool culture should be performed in patients with infectious colitis. Epidemiologic findings, including prior international travel, shellfish-associated diarrhea, and living in parasite-endemic regions, may suggest the need for specialized studies of etiology. When STEC is suspected as a pathogen because only low-grade or no fever is observed in a patient with acute dysentery, a competent laboratory should look for E. coli O157:H7 and Shiga toxin directly in stool.

Once laboratory diagnosis is made, pathogen-specific antimicrobial therapy should be initiated for all forms of infectious colitis other than STEC. For empiric treatment of febrile dysenteric diarrhea, invasive bacterial enteropathogens (Shigella, Salmonella, and Campylobacter) should be suspected, and adults may be treated empirically with 1000 mg of azithromycin in a single dose.

### Differential diagnosis of diarrhea in patients with neuroendocrine tumors [^115tPCnW]. Pancreas (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and carcinoid syndrome experience diarrhea that can have a debilitating effect on quality of life. Diarrhea may also develop in response to other hormonal syndromes associated with NETs, surgical complications, medical comorbidities, medications, or food sensitivities. Limited guidance on the practical approach to the differential diagnosis of diarrhea in these patients can lead to delays in appropriate treatment. This clinical review and commentary underscore the complexity in identifying the etiology of diarrhea in patients with NETs. Based on our collective experience and expertise, we offer a practical algorithm to guide medical oncologists and other care providers to expedite effective management of diarrhea and related symptoms in patients with NETs.

### Chronic gastrointestinal consequences of acute infectious diarrhea: Evolving concepts in epidemiology and pathogenesis [^113uxhgg]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Acute infectious diarrhea frequently occurs in both the developing world, where it results in considerable mortality, and in developed countries, where it accounts for a significant number of health visits, hospitalizations, and medical and non-medical losses. Recent evidence in basic, clinical, and epidemiological science domains suggests that the burden caused by these infections is not confined to the acute illness; they may trigger or contribute to the pathogenesis of various chronic health problems. This review consolidates the breadth of current information, identifies gaps in knowledge, and describes future directions and policy implications related to the chronic consequences of acute infectious diarrhea.

A unifying hypothesis of this review is that infections may trigger long-lasting changes in gut physiology and immunity, increasing the risk of various chronic gastrointestinal diseases, particularly in genetically susceptible individuals.

### Pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of chronic watery diarrhea [^1174bXkA]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic watery diarrhea poses a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge and is often a disabling condition for patients. Although acute diarrhea is likely to be caused by infection, the causes of chronic diarrhea (lasting more than four weeks) are more elusive. This study reviews the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic diarrhea. Drawing on recent insights into the molecular mechanisms of intestinal epithelial transport and barrier function, the study discusses how diarrhea can result from a decrease in luminal solute absorption, an increase in secretion, or both, as well as derangements in barrier properties. It describes the various extraepithelial factors that activate diarrheal mechanisms. Finally, the study reviews clinical evaluation and tests used in the assessment of patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, presenting an algorithm guiding therapeutic decisions and pharmacotherapy.

### The incidence, aetiology, and adverse clinical consequences of less severe diarrhoeal episodes among infants and children residing in low-income and middle-income countries: a 12-month case-control study as a follow-on to the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) [^114qHz45]. The Lancet Global Health (2019). Low credibility.

Diarrheal diseases remain a leading cause of illness and death among children younger than 5 years in low-income and middle-income countries. The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) has described the incidence, aetiology, and sequelae of medically attended moderate-to-severe diarrhoea (MSD) among children aged 0–59 months residing in censused populations in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where most child deaths occur. To further characterize this disease burden and guide interventions, we extended this study to include children with episodes of less-severe diarrhoea (LSD) seeking care at health centres serving six GEMS sites.

- **Methods**: We report a 1-year, multisite, age-stratified, matched case-control study following on to the GEMS study. Six sites (Bamako, Mali; Manhiça, Mozambique; Basse, The Gambia; Mirzapur, Bangladesh; Kolkata, India; and Bin Qasim Town, Karachi, Pakistan) participated in this study. Children aged 0–59 months at each site who sought care at a sentinel hospital or health centre during a 12-month period were screened for diarrhoea. New (onset after ≥ 7 diarrhoea-free days) and acute (onset within the previous 7 days) episodes of diarrhoea in children who had sunken eyes, whose skin lost turgor, who received intravenous hydration, who had dysentery, or who were hospitalised were eligible for inclusion as MSD. The remaining new and acute diarrhoea episodes among children who sought care at the same health centres were considered LSD. We aimed to enrol the first eight or nine eligible children with MSD and LSD at each site during each fo.

### Differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea: An algorithm to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea from other organic gastrointestinal diseases, with special focus on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^1111k6ce]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

In patients with chronic diarrhea and a high probability of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), such as those with pancreatic cancer located in the head of the pancreas, advanced chronic calcifying pancreatitis, or those who have undergone pancreatic surgery like pancreaticoduodenectomy or gastrectomy, the usefulness of pancreatic function tests for the diagnosis of EPI is limited and is not required for a diagnosis to be reached. In contrast, in patients with chronic diarrhea but a low probability of EPI, such as patients without a previous diagnosis of pancreatic disease or surgery, those with no risk factors for pancreatic disease, and those without weight loss or nutritional deficiencies, normal levels of fecal elastase-1 (FE-1) exclude EPI from the differential diagnosis. Low levels may indicate EPI, and exploration of the pancreas is recommended to exclude pancreatic disease, but false-positive results of FE-1 are not infrequent.

EPI is one of several organic gastrointestinal diseases that may mimic irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). EPI, defined by a low FE-1 concentration, is present in 5% to 6% of patients fulfilling Rome criteria for IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) and 4.6% of patients with unexplained abdominal pain and/or diarrhea and/or IBS-D. However, since false-positive FE-1 results are not rare in patients with watery diarrhea, low FE-1 levels do not completely exclude IBS-D.

### Acute bloody diarrhea: A medical emergency for patients of all ages [^115MSYwf]. Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute bloody diarrhea should be considered a medical emergency. Its causes are frequently serious or actionable, or both, and are usually identifiable. However, acute bloody diarrhea as a stand-alone clinical presentation has received little scholarly attention in the past several decades. Although the range of possible causes of acute bloody diarrhea is broad, infectious considerations are paramount and should always be prioritized in the evaluation of such patients. History, examination, and laboratory testing should focus on minimizing time to diagnosis — and, by extension, to implementing appropriate therapy.

Strategically chosen tests and imaging, avoidance of extraneous diagnostic pursuits, and provision of supportive care while awaiting diagnostic clarity are central to the adroit management of patients with acute bloody diarrhea. Diagnostic considerations differ somewhat between adults and children but share many elements, including the need for vigilance in detecting Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection. In this review, we discuss diagnostic approaches by emphasizing the importance of rapid, accurate, and thorough microbiologic investigation and measures that can support patients while awaiting information that determines the cause of their disease. These topics are discussed in the context of the medical care available to children and adults with bloody diarrhea in most institutions in developed nations.

### Differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea: An algorithm to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea from other organic gastrointestinal diseases, with special focus on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^111WdzqG]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhea, defined as diarrhea persisting for more than 4 weeks, affects up to 5% of the population, regardless of age, sex, race, or socioeconomic status. Findings from a recent global internet survey that included 25 countries revealed that, among 54,127 individuals surveyed, 4.7% reported functional diarrhea. The humanistic and economic toll of diarrhea is substantial and imposes considerable burdens, including reductions in health-related quality of life, disruption of daily activities, and significantly increased healthcare resource utilization. Recently, Peery et al. summarized the burden and costs of gastrointestinal illnesses in the United States: in 2016, there were more than 36.8 million ambulatory visits for gastrointestinal symptoms and 43.4 million ambulatory visits with a primary gastrointestinal diagnosis. Diarrhea was the fourth most common gastrointestinal symptom prompting an ambulatory healthcare visit (office and emergency department; n = 2,583,060) and the sixth most common gastrointestinal-based physician diagnosis (n = 1,988,413).

The differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea is vast and varied, including infections (e.g. bacterial, parasitic, viral), endocrinopathies (e.g. hyperthyroidism, diabetes), maldigestive and malabsorptive disorders (e.g. celiac disease, lactose intolerance, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [EPI]), disorders of gut-brain interaction (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome [IBS]), inflammatory conditions (e.g. Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), secondary precipitants such as medications (e.g. laxatives), and ingestion of toxic substances.

### Diagnostic yields in solid organ transplant recipients admitted with diarrhea [^114j3PWq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Although diarrhea is a frequent complaint among solid organ transplant recipients, the contribution of infectious etiologies remains incompletely defined. We sought to define the etiologies of diarrhea and the yields of testing at our institution.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective analysis over an 18-month period of hospitalized solid organ transplant recipients. We stratified diarrhea by community onset vs. hospital onset of diarrhea.

- **Results**: We identified 422 admissions (representing 314 unique patients) with community-onset diarrhea and 112 admissions (representing 102 unique patients) with hospital-onset diarrhea. The majority of community- and hospital-onset diarrheal episodes had no identified etiology (60.9% and 75.9%, respectively; p = 0.03), yet were also self-limited (91% and 91%, respectively; p = 0.894). Thereafter, the most frequently encountered infectious etiologies were Clostridium difficile infection (13.3% and 11.8%, respectively), norovirus enteritis (8.2% and 3%), cytomegalovirus disease or colitis (6.3% and 2.7%), and bacterial enterocolitis (0.9% and 0%) (P = 0.03). In aggregate, these entities represented 93.7% and 90.5% of the identified infectious etiologies, respectively. Protozoan causes were rarely seen. Coinfection, or the simultaneous detection of ≥ 2 pathogens, occurred in 8 (1.9%) and 2 (1.8%) community- and hospital-onset diarrheal admissions, respectively (P = 0.99).

- **Conclusions**: In solid organ transplant recipients who presented at our institution with diarrhea, approximately one-third had infectious etiologies identified.
