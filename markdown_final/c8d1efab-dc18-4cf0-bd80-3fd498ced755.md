## Question

what CYP enzyme metabolizes buprenorphine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which CYP enzyme metabolizes buprenorphine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the primary oxidative pathway responsible for buprenorphine's N-dealkylation. Then, I should verify which CYP isoform predominantly catalyzes this step across authoritative labeling. Next, I will check for any secondary CYP contributors and avoid conflating phase II glucuronidation with CYP metabolism. Finally, I will cross-check clinical drug–drug interaction data to confirm functional relevance and ensure I am not overinterpreting in vitro findings [^112akB1m] [^1127j4XP].

> Let me first confirm the labeled metabolic pathway. The FDA buprenorphine prescribing information states that buprenorphine undergoes N-dealkylation to norbuprenorphine and that this N-dealkylation pathway is mediated primarily by CYP3A4, which directly answers the question about the principal CYP enzyme [^112akB1m]. The Belbuca (buccal buprenorphine) label independently reports the same finding, explicitly noting that buprenorphine undergoes N-dealkylation mediated primarily by CYP3A4, reinforcing that CYP3A4 is the dominant oxidative enzyme for buprenorphine metabolism [^1127j4XP].

> Wait, let me verify this with clinical interaction data rather than relying solely on mechanistic statements. The Suboxone label shows that coadministration with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, increases buprenorphine exposure (Cmax and AUC), which functionally supports a primary role of CYP3A4 in vivo [^1118JuW8]. Hold on, I should also check transdermal data; Butrans interaction studies with ketoconazole suggest limited accumulation in that specific context, but the program still evaluates CYP3A4-mediated interactions, which is consistent with CYP3A4 involvement while acknowledging formulation- and route-specific nuances [^115dJMzT]. I need to ensure this aligns with quantitative modeling; a PBPK analysis based on human mass balance and clinical DDI data similarly identifies CYP3A4 (and UGT1A1 for conjugation) as primary metabolic pathways for buprenorphine, corroborating the clinical labels [^115iZYbE].

> I should confirm whether any other CYPs contribute appreciably. Some older or lower-credibility literature suggests possible minor contributions from CYP2C8, but these do not supersede the consistent designation of CYP3A4 as the primary N-dealkylating enzyme in high-credibility sources, so I will regard CYP2C8, if involved, as secondary or minor in typical hepatic metabolism [^113uwMGM] [^115Dozfa]. Let me be precise: phase II metabolism occurs via glucuronidation of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine (for example by UGT2B7 and UGT1A1), but that is distinct from the CYP question at hand, and does not change that the principal phase I CYP route is CYP3A4-mediated N-dealkylation [^115Dozfa] [^115iZYbE].

> Hmm, wait a minute — buprenorphine is also described as a CYP inhibitor in some labels; I need to ensure I'm not confusing inhibition with substrate status. The buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone labels note in vitro inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 by buprenorphine or norbuprenorphine at therapeutic concentrations, but that does not imply these are the primary metabolic pathways for buprenorphine as a substrate; substrate metabolism remains primarily via CYP3A4-mediated N-dealkylation, whereas these inhibition findings relate to potential DDI liability and are concentration-dependent [^111a2BaP] [^113GnvJo].

> But wait, what if extrahepatic tissues change the answer? I should double-check placental data because buprenorphine is used in pregnancy. Placental microsome studies show CYP19 (aromatase) is the major enzyme responsible for buprenorphine biotransformation in the placenta, which is a different tissue-specific context; however, for systemic drug metabolism in adults, the primary hepatic CYP remains CYP3A4, so this does not contradict the general clinical answer [^112Nf2bm] [^112akB1m].

> Let me synthesize and state this clearly so there's no ambiguity. Buprenorphine is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 via N-dealkylation to norbuprenorphine, with possible minor contributions from other CYPs (for example, CYP2C8) noted in lower-credibility sources; phase II glucuronidation of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine follows via UGTs, and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers can meaningfully alter exposure in line with this pathway [^112akB1m] [^1127j4XP] [^1118JuW8].

CYP3A4 is the **primary CYP enzyme** responsible for buprenorphine metabolism [^112akB1m], catalyzing N-dealkylation to norbuprenorphine [^1127j4XP] [^115iZYbE]. CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir) [^1118JuW8] [^115MngaU] can **increase buprenorphine levels** and risk of adverse effects, while **CYP3A4 inducers** (e.g. rifampin, carbamazepine) can **reduce efficacy**; monitor patients and adjust doses as needed. CYP2C8 [^113uwMGM] and CYP2D6 have **minor roles**, and genetic variability in CYP3A4 can affect exposure and response [^113tAL6P] [^1169SxBr].

## Primary CYP enzyme involved in buprenorphine metabolism

**CYP3A4** is the primary CYP enzyme [^112akB1m] responsible for buprenorphine metabolism, catalyzing N-dealkylation to norbuprenorphine [^1127j4XP] [^115iZYbE]. Norbuprenorphine is further glucuronidated by UGT enzymes, mainly UGT2B7 and UGT1A1 [^115Dozfa] [^115iZYbE].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting CYP3A4's role

Clinical evidence shows that **CYP3A4 inhibitors** (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir) [^1118JuW8] [^115MngaU] increase buprenorphine exposure, while **CYP3A4 inducers** (e.g. rifampin, carbamazepine) reduce it [^115Dozfa]. A ketoconazole interaction study with BUTRANS showed no accumulation [^115dJMzT]; however, other data confirm **CYP3A4's** central role for transmucosal products [^1127j4XP].

---

## Secondary CYP enzymes involved

Among secondary CYP enzymes, **CYP2C8** plays a minor role in buprenorphine metabolism [^113uwMGM], while **CYP2D6** contributes minimally; buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine are weak CYP2D6 inhibitors in vitro, with limited clinical impact [^1127j4XP].

---

## Clinical implications of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism

### Drug-drug interactions

CYP3A4 inhibitors increase **buprenorphine levels** [^115MngaU] and the risk of **sedation, respiratory depression, and overdose**; monitor and consider dose reduction [^1127j4XP]. In contrast, **CYP3A4 inducers** decrease buprenorphine levels and efficacy [^115Dozfa], risking withdrawal or relapse; monitor and consider dose increase [^1127j4XP].

---

### Genetic variability

CYP3A4 polymorphisms [^113tAL6P] can **alter enzyme activity and buprenorphine exposure** [^1169SxBr], affecting efficacy and adverse effects. Genetic testing may help identify patients at risk of altered metabolism and guide dosing [^1148xMJP].

## Summary table: CYP enzymes involved in buprenorphine metabolism

| **CYP enzyme** | **Role in metabolism** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| CYP3A4 | - Primary enzyme <br/> - N-dealkylation to norbuprenorphine | - High <br/> - Major determinant of exposure and interactions |
| CYP2C8 | Minor role | - Low <br/> - Limited clinical impact |
| CYP2D6 | Minimal role | - Low <br/> - Limited clinical impact |

---

CYP3A4 is the **primary enzyme** metabolizing buprenorphine to norbuprenorphine [^112akB1m]; inhibitors increase exposure and adverse effects, while inducers reduce efficacy. CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 have minor roles [^113uwMGM], and CYP3A4 genetic variability can influence clinical response [^113tAL6P].

Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is involved in the metabolism of more drugs in clinical use than any other foreign compound-metabolizing enzyme in humans. Recently, increasing evidence has been found showing that variants in the CYP3A4 gene have functional significance and, in rare cases, lead to loss of activity, implying tremendous consequences for patients. This review article highlights the functional consequences of all CYP3A4 variants recognized by the Human Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Allele Nomenclature Database.

### Belbuca [^1127j4XP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Drug interaction studies**: Buprenorphine undergoes N-dealkylation mediated primarily by CYP3A4, so its metabolism can be inhibited by CYP3A4 inhibitors. The interaction of buprenorphine with all CYP3A4 inducers has not been studied [see Drug Interactions (7)].

- **CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers**: Buprenorphine has been found to be a CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitor, and its major metabolite, norbuprenorphine, has been found to be a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor with in vitro studies employing human liver microsomes. However, the relatively low plasma concentrations of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine resulting from therapeutic doses are not expected to raise significant drug-drug interaction concerns.

### Suboxone [^1118JuW8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

**Drug-drug interactions**: CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers: A pharmacokinetic interaction study of ketoconazole (400 mg/day), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, in 12 patients stabilized on Suboxone [8 mg (n = 1), 12 mg (n = 5), or 16 mg (n = 6)] resulted in increases in buprenorphine mean Cmax values (from 4.3 to 9.8, 6.3 to 14.4, and 9.0 to 17.1) and mean AUC values (from 30.9 to 46.9, 41.9 to 83.2, and 52.3 to 120) respectively. Subjects receiving Subutex or Suboxone should be closely monitored and may require dose reduction if inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as azole antifungal agents (e.g. ketoconazole), macrolide antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin), and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir) are co-administered. The interaction of buprenorphine with CYP3A4 inducers has not been investigated; therefore, it is recommended that patients receiving Subutex or Suboxone should be closely monitored if inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin) are co-administered (see warnings).

Pharmacokinetics

- **Absorption**: Plasma levels of buprenorphine increased with the sublingual dose of buprenorphine sublingual tablets. There was wide inter-patient variability in the sublingual absorption, but within subjects, the variability was low. Both Cmax and AUC of buprenorphine increased in a linear fashion with the increase in dose (in the range of 4 mg to 16 mg), although the increase was not directly dose-proportional.

- **Distribution**: Buprenorphine is approximately 96% protein-bound, primarily to alpha and beta globulin.

- **Elimination**:

	- **Metabolism**: Buprenorphine undergoes both N-dealkylation to norbuprenorphine and glucuronidation. The N-dealkylation pathway is mediated primarily by CYP3A4. Norbuprenorphine, the major metabolite, can further undergo glucuronidation. Norbuprenorphine has been found to bind opioid receptors in vitro; however, it is not known whether it contributes to the overall effect of buprenorphine sublingual tablets.

	- **Excretion**: A mass balance study of buprenorphine showed complete recovery of radiolabel in urine (30%) and feces (69%) collected up to 11 days after dosing. Almost all of the dose was accounted for in terms of buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine, and two unidentified buprenorphine metabolites. In urine, most of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine were conjugated (buprenorphine: 1% free and 9.4% conjugated; norbuprenorphine: 2.7% free and 11% conjugated). In feces, almost all of the buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine were free (buprenorphine: 33% free and 5% conjugated; norbuprenorphine: 21% free and contribution of overall effect.

### Clinical importance of the cytochromes P450 [^114MZyGf]. Lancet (2002). Low credibility.

The human cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily comprises 57 genes. These genes code for enzymes that play a role in the metabolism of drugs, foreign chemicals, arachidonic acid, eicosanoids; cholesterol metabolism and bile-acid biosynthesis; steroid synthesis and metabolism; vitamin D(3) synthesis and metabolism; retinoic acid hydroxylation; and others of still unknown function. Cytochrome P450 was once believed to be primarily a hepatic drug detoxification system but is now understood to facilitate a myriad of enzymatic reactions implicated in important life processes. Mutations in many CYP genes cause inborn errors of metabolism and contribute to various clinically relevant diseases.

### Opioid therapies and cytochrome P450 interactions [^1126i3Yj]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2012). Low credibility.

Adverse drug reactions are common and associated with substantial economic and human costs. Particularly among older adult populations, preventable adverse drug reactions are often caused by drug-drug interactions. All analgesics have side effect profiles, and many have known drug-drug interactions. Opioids are recognized as a necessary option for managing moderate-to-severe pain, yet many opioid side effects can be enhanced by metabolic interactions within the liver, involving other drugs, diseases, or genetics.

### Butrans [^115dJMzT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Following transdermal application, buprenorphine is eliminated via hepatic metabolism, with subsequent biliary excretion and renal excretion of soluble metabolites. After removal of Butrans, mean buprenorphine concentrations decrease by approximately 50% within 10–24 hours, followed by a decline with an apparent terminal half-life of approximately 26 hours. Since metabolism and excretion of buprenorphine occur mainly via hepatic elimination, reductions in hepatic blood flow induced by some general anesthetics (e.g. halothane) and other drugs may result in a decreased rate of hepatic elimination of the drug, leading to increased plasma concentrations.

The total clearance of buprenorphine is approximately 55 L/hour in postoperative patients.

- **Drug interaction studies**:

	- **Effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors**: In a drug-drug interaction study, Butrans 10 mcg/hour (single dose x 7 days) was co-administered with 200 mg ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, or a ketoconazole placebo twice daily for 11 days, and the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and its metabolites were evaluated. Plasma buprenorphine concentrations did not accumulate during co-medication with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily. Based on the results from this study, metabolism during therapy with Butrans is not expected to be affected by co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7)].

- **Antiretroviral agents**: These have been evaluated for CYP3A4 mediated interactions with sublingual buprenorphine. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) do not affect the metabolism of buprenorphine.

### Pharmacogenetics affects dosing, efficacy, and toxicity of cytochrome P450-metabolized drugs [^1148xMJP]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Drug-metabolizing enzyme activity is one of many factors affecting patient response to medications. The objective of this review is to highlight the potential for genetic variability in cytochrome P450 enzyme activity that can lead to interperson differences in response to drugs. Awareness and application of this knowledge will improve drug use in clinical practice and provide the physician with further appreciation that standard drug dosing may not be appropriate in all patients.

### Common polymorphisms of CYP2B6 influence stereoselective bupropion disposition [^116Ge6QC]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Low credibility.

Bupropion hydroxylation is a bioactivation and metabolic pathway, and the standard clinical CYP2B6 probe. This investigation determined the influence of CYP2B6 allelic variants on clinical concentrations and metabolism of bupropion enantiomers. Secondary objectives evaluated the influence of CYP2C19 and P450 oxidoreductase variants. Healthy volunteers in specific cohorts (CYP2B6*1/*1, CYP2B6*1/*6, CYP2B6*6/*6, and also CYP2B6*4 carriers) received single-dose oral bupropion. Plasma and urine bupropion and hydroxybupropion were quantified. Subjects were also genotyped for CYP2C19 and P450 oxidoreductase variants. Hydroxylation of both bupropion enantiomers, assessed by plasma hydroxybupropion/bupropion AUC ratios and urine hydroxybupropion formation clearances, was lower in CYP2B6*6/*6 but not CYP2B6*1/*6 compared with CYP2B6*1/*1 genotypes, and numerically greater in CYP2B6*4 carriers. CYP2C19 and P450 oxidoreductase variants did not influence bupropion enantiomers' hydroxylation or plasma concentrations. The results show that clinical hydroxylation of both bupropion enantiomers was equivalently influenced by CYP2B6 allelic variation. CYP2B6 polymorphisms affect S-bupropion bioactivation, which may affect therapeutic outcomes.

### ABCB1 and cytochrome P450 genotypes and phenotypes: Influence on methadone plasma levels and response to treatment [^111gj1Ss]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

The in vivo implication of various cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms and of P-glycoprotein on methadone kinetics is unclear. We aimed to thoroughly examine the genetic factors influencing methadone kinetics and response to treatment.

- **Methods**: Genotyping for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, ABCB1, and UGT2B7 polymorphisms was performed in 245 patients undergoing methadone maintenance treatment. To assess CYP3A activity, the patients were phenotyped with midazolam.

- **Results**: The patients with lower CYP3A activity presented higher steady-state trough (R, S)-methadone plasma levels (4.3, 3.0, and 2.3 ng/mL x mg for low, medium, and high activity, respectively; p = 0.0002). As previously reported, CYP2B6*6/*6 carriers had significantly higher trough (S)-methadone plasma levels (P = 0.0001) and a trend toward higher (R)-methadone plasma levels (P = 0.07). CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers presented lower trough (R, S)-methadone plasma levels compared with the extensive or intermediate metabolizers (2.4 and 3.3 ng/mL x mg, respectively; p = 0.04), whereas CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status showed no influence. ABCB1 3435TT carriers presented lower trough (R, S)-methadone plasma levels (2.7 and 3.4 ng/mL. mg for 3435TT and 3435CC carriers, respectively; p = 0.01). The CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A5, and UGT2B7 genotypes did not influence methadone plasma levels. Only CYP2B6 displayed a stereoselectivity in its activity.

- **Conclusion**: In vivo, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are the major CYP isoforms involved in methadone metabolism, with CYP2D6 contributing to.

### Olinvyk [^114Vrx9H]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Drug interaction studies

In vitro studies suggest that oliceridine is metabolized primarily by the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 P450 hepatic enzymes, with minor contributions from CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Inhibition studies using selective inhibitors of all the major CYP enzymes show that only the inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 significantly affects the metabolism of oliceridine in these assays, suggesting that the contribution of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 to the metabolism of oliceridine is minor.

The effect of concomitant administration of a CYP2D6 inhibitor on the pharmacokinetics of Olinvyk, although not studied, may be similar to that noted in subjects who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. The plasma clearance of oliceridine in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers is approximately 50% of plasma clearance in subjects who are nonpoor CYP2D6 metabolizers [see Pharmacogenomics (12.5)].

In healthy subjects, CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (n = 4) given a single 0.25 mg dose of Olinvyk after 5 days of itraconazole 200 mg QD (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor), the total exposure (AUC) of Olinvyk was increased by approximately 80%; however, the peak concentration was not significantly affected [see Pharmacogenomics (12.5)]. The mean clearance of oliceridine was reduced to approximately 30% of that observed in nonpoor metabolizers of CYP2D6 [see Drug interactions (7)].

Oliceridine does not inhibit any P450 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations.

- **Pharmacogenomics**: Oliceridine is metabolized by polymorphic enzyme CYP2D6. CYP2D6 poor metabolizers have little to no enzyme activity. Approximately 3 to 10% of Whites…

### A phase 1b study to investigate the potential interactions between ASP8062 and buprenorphine/naloxone in patients with opioid use disorder [^111tNytT]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). High credibility.

There is an unmet need for therapeutics with greater efficacy and tolerability for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD). ASP8062 is a novel compound with positive allosteric modulator activity on the γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptor being developed for use with standard-of-care treatment for patients with OUD.

- **Aims**: To investigate the safety, tolerability, interaction potential, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ASP8062 in combination with buprenorphine/naloxone (B/N; Suboxone®).

- **Methods**: In this phase 1, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study, patients with OUD began B/N (titrated to 16/4 mg/day) treatment upon enrollment (induction, Days 1–4; maintenance, Days 5–18; downward titration, Days 19–26; and discharge, Day 27). On Day 12, patients received a single dose of ASP8062 60 mg or placebo with B/N and underwent safety and PK assessments. Primary endpoints included frequency and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), clinical laboratory tests, respiratory depression, and suicidal ideation. Secondary endpoints investigated the impact of ASP8062 on B/N PK.

- **Results**: Eighteen patients were randomized and completed the study (ASP8062, n = 12; placebo, n = 6). With this sample size typical for phase 1 drug-drug interaction studies, ASP8062 was well tolerated; most TEAEs were mild in severity and none led to treatment withdrawal. ASP8062 did not enhance substance use-related TEAEs, respiratory depression, or suicidal ideation and did not have a clinically significant impact on the PK of B/N.

### Sex and gender differences in clinical pharmacology: Implications for transgender medicine [^116P3oD8]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

CYP3A metabolizes more than 50% of prescribed medications. In the general adult population younger than 50 years of age, cisgender women have a higher weight-normalized clearance of oral and parenteral CYP3A substrates than cisgender men, although this difference is modest (up to 35%). Investigators hypothesized that sex-related differences in CYP3A activity are associated with P-glycoprotein activity, complicating our ability to determine the effect of sex hormones on CYP3A activity directly. During pregnancy, CYP3A activity is higher compared with postpartum activity. Sex hormones (estrogen replacement therapy or combined oral contraceptives) do not alter systemic or oral midazolam clearance. In addition to hormone therapy, transgender adults may take several medications metabolized by CYP3A, including antiretroviral therapy protease inhibitors.

- **Phase II metabolism and conjugation enzymes**: In the general adult population, weight-adjusted oral clearance of several nonspecific uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) substrates is higher in cisgender men than in cisgender women. For example, benzodiazepines (oxazepam, 40% higher, P < 0.05) and antipyretics (acetaminophen, 22% higher, P < 0.001) show this pattern. During pregnancy, apparent UGT1A4 activity increases compared with postpartum, demonstrated by decreased lamotrigine concentrations. Sex hormones, such as combined oral contraceptives, similarly increase the clearance of UGT substrates. For example, Christensen et al. reported an 84% increase (95% confidence interval, 45–134%) in dose-corrected lamotrigine concentrations.

### The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile of intranasal crushed buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone tablets in opioid abusers [^115VY3hF]. Addiction (2011). Low credibility.

Sublingual buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone are efficacious opioid dependence pharmacotherapies, but there are reports of their diversion and misuse by the intranasal route. The study objectives were to characterize and compare their intranasal pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles.

- **Design**: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study.

- **Setting**: An in-patient research unit at the University of Kentucky.

- **Participants**: Healthy adults (n = 10) abusing but not physically dependent on intranasal opioids.

- **Measurements**: Six sessions (72 hours apart) tested five intranasal doses [0/0, crushed buprenorphine (2, 8 mg), crushed buprenorphine/naloxone (2/0.5, 8/2 mg)] and one intravenous dose (0.8 mg buprenorphine/0.2 mg naloxone for bioavailability assessment). Plasma samples, physiological, subject- and observer-rated measures were collected before and for up to 72 hours after drug administration.

- **Findings**: Both formulations produced time- and dose-dependent increases in subjective and physiological mu-opioid agonist effects (e.g. 'liking', miosis). Subjects reported higher subjective ratings and street values for 8 mg compared to 8/2 mg, but these differences were not statistically significant. No significant formulation differences in peak plasma buprenorphine concentration or time-course were observed. Buprenorphine bioavailability was 38–44% and T(max) was 35–40 minutes after all intranasal doses. Naloxone bioavailability was 24% and 30% following 2/0.5 and 8/2 mg, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: It is difficult to determine if observed data supports or contradicts the intended outcomes.

### Biased cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism via small-molecule ligands binding P450 oxidoreductase [^1149agRd]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

Metabolic control is mediated by the dynamic assemblies and function of multiple redox enzymes. A key element in these assemblies, the P450 oxidoreductase (POR), donates electrons and selectively activates numerous (> 50 in humans and > 300 in plants) cytochromes P450 (CYPs). These CYPs control the metabolism of drugs, steroids, and xenobiotics in humans, as well as natural product biosynthesis in plants. The mechanisms underlying POR-mediated CYP metabolism remain poorly understood; at the time of writing, no ligand binding has been described to regulate the specificity of POR.

Here, using a combination of computational modeling and functional assays, we identify ligands that dock on POR and bias its specificity towards CYP redox partners across the mammal and plant kingdoms. Single-molecule FRET studies reveal ligand binding alters POR conformational sampling, which results in biased activation of metabolic cascades in whole cell assays. We propose the model of biased metabolism — a mechanism akin to biased signaling of GPCRs — where ligand binding on POR stabilizes different conformational states linked to distinct metabolic outcomes. Biased metabolism may allow the design of pathway-specific therapeutics or personalized foods that suppress undesired, disease-related metabolic pathways.

### The systems biology of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters: Relevance to quantitative systems pharmacology [^114L2GXE]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

Since their discovery, cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes — heme proteins that catalyze numerous so-called phase I chemical reactions, such as hydroxylation, oxidation, and reduction — have often been described as drug and toxicant metabolizing enzymes (phase I DMEs). The growth of information regarding CYP450-mediated drug metabolism, coupled with knowledge of phase II conjugation pathways, including UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) that catalyze the covalent linkage of glucuronic acid to substrates, has allowed for the prediction of drug interactions at the level of metabolism, leading to greater safety in the prescription of certain drugs. Further individualization of drug therapy is achieved through understanding genetic polymorphisms in DMEs that affect drug metabolism and are thereby linked to response or toxicity.

Although it is beyond the scope of this paper to synthesize the vast amount of data regarding phase I and phase II DMEs in physiology, particularly as it pertains to links with transporters, we will highlight some examples of how the endogenous roles of these enzymes connect to SLC and ABC transporters in certain physiological contexts.

### Worldwide distribution of cytochrome P450 alleles: A meta-analysis of population-scale sequencing projects [^1133DR2V]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Drug response is highly variable between individuals, resulting in 40–70% of patients exhibiting a lack of efficacy of pharmacological treatment or adverse drug reactions. Importantly, it is estimated that 15–30% of this variability is caused by genetic polymorphisms. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and their roles in drug metabolism have been extensively studied and constitute major determinants of drug response, as they are responsible for 80% of phase 1 drug metabolism and 65–70% of drug clearance. Furthermore, metabolism by polymorphic phase 1 enzymes, primarily CYPs, has been implicated in an increased risk of drugs causing adverse drug reactions.

The human CYP supergene family consists of 57 genes; however, 12 of the encoded enzymes are responsible for more than 75% of all phase 1 drug oxidation reactions. Importantly, these CYP genes are highly polymorphic and harbor a large repertoire of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variations. This diversity is primarily based on low evolutionary constraints due to the lack of essential endogenous functions of the encoded gene products and genetic drift. Yet, although the vast majority of such polymorphisms are rare with minor allele frequencies (MAFs) < 1%, pharmacogenetic testing in the clinics is currently restricted to validated and experimentally characterized variants for the derivation of qualified predictions about the phenotypic consequences of the observed genetic variation patterns.

### The clinical implications of cytochrome P450 interactions with opioids and strategies for pain management [^115kZNjB]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2012). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetic differences among opioids significantly influence a patient's response to opioid treatment. An important factor affecting a drug's pharmacokinetics is its metabolism, which may be altered under various circumstances. This can enhance or mitigate a patient's response to opioids. The genetic background of the metabolic enzymes involved in opioid metabolism, comorbid medical conditions, older age, and the presence of other drugs that influence metabolism are factors that can cause the response to opioid therapy to vary greatly from the expected response to a standard dose. Consequently, due to the variability in individual responses to opioids, clinical management of pain with opioids must be empirical.

### Perioperative opioid requirements of patients receiving sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone: a case series [^115gUJnZ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine is a partial μ-opioid receptor agonist with high receptor affinity and slow dissociation. Because of its long half-life, the peak-and-valley plasma effects seen with shorter-acting opioids are minimized. Furthermore, buprenorphine exerts κ-opioid receptor antagonism, minimizing the psychotomimetic and euphoric effects associated with opioid use. These unique features are useful for the treatment of chronic pain and maintenance therapy for individuals with opioid use disorders.

Buprenorphine is sometimes coadministered with naloxone, most commonly in the sublingual formulation (film or tablet) containing buprenorphine and naloxone in a 4:1 ratio (Suboxone [SL-BUP]; Indivior Inc). A combination of buprenorphine and naloxone reduces the potential for inappropriate use of buprenorphine because naloxone has poor bioavailability when taken sublingually; therefore, only clinically insignificant amounts of naloxone are absorbed into the blood. However, when buprenorphine-naloxone is abused, by intravenous or intranasal administration, naloxone is an effective antagonist of buprenorphine.

Buprenorphine may have implications in perioperative pain management. Because it has high receptor affinity, buprenorphine displaces full opioid agonists from receptors. In addition, it reportedly has an analgesic ceiling effect, and therefore, less efficiently provides pain relief to patients after surgery with expected high pain acuity. The effect of SL-BUP on perioperative pain management has rarely been reported. In the present study, we explored this area to enhance understanding of its implications.

### Buprenorphine [^116EbHWj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Managing the risks associated with the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is crucial in buprenorphine treatment. The combined use of buprenorphine and these substances heightens the risk of adverse reactions, including overdose and death. However, medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder should not be categorically denied to patients on these drugs, as prohibiting or creating barriers to treatment can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality from opioid use disorder alone.

As part of routine orientation to buprenorphine treatment, educate patients about the dangers of using benzodiazepines, sedatives, opioid analgesics, and alcohol concurrently with buprenorphine. Developing strategies to manage the use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is essential at the initiation of buprenorphine treatment, or if such use becomes a concern during treatment. This may require adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring. There is no evidence to support dose limitations or arbitrary caps on buprenorphine to address benzodiazepine use in patients undergoing buprenorphine treatment. However, if a patient is sedated at the time of buprenorphine dosing, it may be appropriate to delay or omit the dose.

Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is generally preferred when used concomitantly. In certain cases, it may be appropriate to monitor the patient in a higher level of care during a taper. Alternatively, gradually tapering a patient off a prescribed benzodiazepine or CNS depressant, or reducing it to the lowest effective dose, may be suitable.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^113GnvJo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Buprenorphine and naloxone are important subjects of study with respect to their drug interaction profiles and effects in specific populations.

- **Drug interaction studies**: Buprenorphine is identified as a CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitor. Its major metabolite, norbuprenorphine, is a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor as demonstrated with in vitro studies using human liver microsomes. Despite these observations, the relatively low plasma concentrations of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine at therapeutic doses are not expected to pose significant drug-drug interaction concerns [see Drug Interactions (7)].

- **Specific populations**:
	- **Hepatic impairment**: A pharmacokinetic study examined buprenorphine and naloxone disposition following the administration of a 2/0.5 mg sublingual tablet in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment, classified according to the Child-Pugh criteria. Comparisons were made against subjects with normal hepatic function.
		- In subjects with mild hepatic impairment, there were no clinically significant changes in mean Cmax, AUC0-last, and half-life values for both buprenorphine and naloxone. Consequently, no dosing adjustments are required.
		- Subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment exhibited increases in mean Cmax, AUC0-last, and half-life values for both substances, with more pronounced effects on naloxone than on buprenorphine.

Table 6 referenced in the study highlights the pharmacokinetic parameter changes in subjects experiencing moderate and severe hepatic impairment. It underscores the significant differences in the magnitude of effects between naloxone and buprenorphine.

### Apadaz [^1123LRa7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Elimination**: Hydrocodone is eliminated primarily through the kidneys. Acetaminophen is principally eliminated by liver metabolism and subsequent renal excretion of metabolites.

- **Metabolism**: Benzhydrocodone serves as a prodrug of hydrocodone and is converted into active hydrocodone by enzymes within the intestinal tract. Hydrocodone exhibits a complex pattern of metabolism, including O-demethylation, N-demethylation, and 6-keto reduction to its corresponding 6-α and 6-β-hydroxy metabolites. Hydromorphone, a potent opioid, is formed from the O-demethylation of hydrocodone and contributes to the total analgesic effect of hydrocodone [see Drug Interactions (7)]. The O- and N-demethylation processes are mediated by separate P-450 isoenzymes: CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, respectively.

Acetaminophen is primarily metabolized in the liver through first-order kinetics and involves three principal pathways:

a) Conjugation with glucuronide.

b) Conjugation with sulfate.

c) Oxidation via the cytochrome P450-dependent, mixed-function oxidase enzyme pathway to form a reactive intermediate metabolite, which conjugates with glutathione and is then further metabolized to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates. The principal cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved appears to be CYP2E1, with CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 as additional pathways.

### Allelic expression imbalance of the human CYP3A4 gene and individual phenotypic status [^1169SxBr]. Human Molecular Genetics (2004). Low credibility.

The human cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) plays a dominant role in the metabolism of numerous clinically useful drugs. Alterations in the activity or expression of this enzyme may account for a major part of the variation in drug responsiveness and toxicity. However, it is generally accepted that most of the known single nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding and 5'-flanking regions are not the main determinants for the large inter-individual variability of CYP3A4 expression and activity. We show that the allelic variation is critically involved in determining the individual total hepatic CYP3A4 mRNA level and metabolic capability. There exists a definite correlation between the total CYP3A4 mRNA level and allelic expression ratio, the relative transcript level ratio derived from the two alleles. Individuals with a low expression ratio, exhibiting a large difference in transcript level between the two alleles, revealed extremely low levels of total hepatic CYP3A4 mRNA, and thus low metabolic capability as assessed by testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation. These results present a new insight into the individualized CYP3A4-dependent pharmacotherapy and the importance of expression imbalance to human phenotypic diversity.

### Genome-wide discovery of drug-dependent human liver regulatory elements [^114zXvP7]. PLoS Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

Adverse reactions to drug treatment constitute a substantial health problem and are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Differential expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters is a major determinant of inter-individual drug response variability. By sequestering and metabolizing drug compounds in the liver and intestine, these enzymes and transporters effectively determine whether target organs and tissues are exposed to optimal drug dosages. Several coding mutations in these proteins have been detected, leading to adverse outcomes and reduced drug activity. Regulatory elements, including promoters and enhancers, also likely play an important role that has so far been largely uncharacterized. The systematic identification of drug-responsive regulatory elements would thus provide a unique resource to discover novel genetic variants that lead to differences in drug response.

The vast majority of pharmaceutical compounds are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 family (CYP) of enzymes. Of these, CYP3A4 is the most abundantly expressed in sites of drug disposition in the liver and is thought to be responsible for the metabolism of at least 50% of prescribed pharmaceuticals. CYP3A4 activity can vary 5–20 fold between individuals and its mRNA expression can vary as much as 120 fold. Only a few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the immediate CYP3A4 locus have been found to be associated with CYP3A4 hepatic expression, suggesting that its variable expression could be caused by other genes.

### Butrans [^111Gh8Su]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The effect of CYP3A4 inducers on buprenorphine has not been studied.

- **Specific populations**:

- **Age: Geriatric patients**: Following a single application of Butrans 10 mcg/hour to 12 healthy young adults (mean age 32 years) and 12 healthy elderly subjects (mean age 72 years), the pharmacokinetic profile of Butrans was similar in both groups. However, the elderly subjects showed a trend toward higher plasma concentrations immediately after Butrans removal. Both the young and elderly subjects eliminated buprenorphine at similar rates after system removal [see Use in specific populations (8.5)].

	- In a study of healthy young subjects, healthy elderly subjects, and elderly subjects treated with thiazide diuretics, Butrans at a fixed dose-escalation schedule (Butrans 5 mcg/hour for 3 days, followed by Butrans 10 mcg/hour for 3 days and Butrans 20 mcg/hour for 7 days) produced similar mean plasma concentration versus time profiles for each of the three subject groups. There were no significant differences between groups in buprenorphine Cmax or AUC [see Use in specific populations (8.5)].

- **Sex**: In a pooled data analysis from several studies that administered Butrans 10 mcg/hour to healthy subjects, no differences in buprenorphine Cmax and AUC or body-weight normalized Cmax and AUC were observed between males and females treated with Butrans.

### Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models as enablers of precision dosing in drug development: Pivotal role of the human mass balance study [^115iZYbE]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). High credibility.

The treatment of neonatal abstinence syndrome, a condition affecting newborns exposed to an opioid in utero, often involves the use of buprenorphine. Conducting pharmacokinetic studies of buprenorphine in children, particularly neonates, presents challenges, leading to limited available data. The development of a high-fidelity PBPK model allows for the assessment of dosing strategies for buprenorphine in this population.

Clearance routes, including cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated, uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)-mediated metabolism, and biliary clearance, were assigned based on MB data, which includes metabolite identification after intravenous administration. In vitro studies indicate that CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 are the primary enzymes involved in metabolism. Approximately 33% of the parent drug appears unchanged in the feces, possibly due to buprenorphine undergoing P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated efflux out of the liver or deconjugation of the glucuronidated form of the parent drug. Both scenarios were evaluated using the PBPK model, and the relative contributions of the different clearance mechanisms were confirmed using clinical DDI data within the PLCA framework.

The application of age-related physiology and enzyme ontogeny demonstrated that the model effectively captured exposures of buprenorphine after sublingual dosing in term neonates with neonatal abstinence syndrome.

### Survey of buprenorphine low-dose regimens used by healthcare institutions [^11381rhZ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine microdosing ("low-dosing") allows for initiation of buprenorphine without requiring patients to endure withdrawal. Case studies suggest its favorable utility as an alternative to conventional buprenorphine induction. However, published regimens vary in duration, dosage forms used, and timing of full opioid agonist discontinuation.

- **Methods**: This cross-sectional survey study sought to determine how buprenorphine low-dosing is approached by medical institutions across the United States. The primary endpoint was characterization of inpatient buprenorphine low-dosing regimens. Situations and types of patients in which low-dosing is used and obstacles to institutional protocol development were also collected. An online survey was disseminated through professional pharmacy organizations and personal contacts. Responses were collected over four weeks.

- **Results**: Twenty-three unique protocols were collected from 25 institutions. Most protocols used buccal (8 protocols) or transdermal (8 protocols) buprenorphine as first doses before transitioning to sublingual buprenorphine. The most common starting doses were buprenorphine 20 μg/h transdermal, 150 μg buccal, and 0.5 mg sublingual. Patients unable to tolerate conventional buprenorphine induction or those who potentially used fentanyl nonmedically were most likely to be prescribed low-dosing. The most common obstacle to developing an internal low-dosing protocol was lack of existing consensus guidelines.

- **Conclusions**: Similar to published regimens, internal protocols are variable. Buccal first doses may be used as an initial step.

### Buprenorphine [^111a2BaP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

When buprenorphine sublingual tablets are administered sublingually, buprenorphine has a mean elimination half-life from plasma ranging from 31 to 35 hours.

- **Drug interactions studies**: Buprenorphine has been found to be a CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitor, and its major metabolite, norbuprenorphine, has been found to be a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor with in vitro studies employing human liver microsomes. However, the relatively low plasma concentrations of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine resulting from therapeutic doses are not expected to raise significant drug-drug interaction concerns [see Drug Interactions (7)].

- **Specific populations**:
	- **Hepatic impairment**: In a pharmacokinetic study, the disposition of buprenorphine was determined after administering a 2.0 mg/0.5 mg buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablet in subjects with varied degrees of hepatic impairment, as indicated by Child-Pugh criteria. The disposition of buprenorphine in patients with hepatic impairment was compared to the disposition in subjects with normal hepatic function. In subjects with mild hepatic impairment, the changes in mean Cmax, AUC0-last, and half-life values of buprenorphine were not clinically significant. For subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, mean Cmax, AUC0-last, and half-life values of buprenorphine were increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

	- **HCV infection**: In subjects with HCV infection but no signs of hepatic impairment, the changes in the mean Cmax, AUC0-last, and half-life values of buprenorphine were not clinically significant.

### Buprenorphine [^114X2XXN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Clinical studies on the safety and efficacy of buprenorphine were derived from studies of buprenorphine sublingual tablet formulations, with and without naloxone, and from studies of sublingual administration of a more bioavailable ethanolic solution of buprenorphine. Buprenorphine sublingual tablets were studied in 1,834 patients; buprenorphine and naloxone tablets in 575 patients, and buprenorphine sublingual solutions in 2,470 patients. A total of 1,270 women received buprenorphine in those clinical trials. Dosing recommendations are based on data from one trial of both tablet formulations and two trials of the ethanolic solution. All trials used buprenorphine in conjunction with psychosocial counseling as part of a comprehensive addiction treatment program. There were no clinical studies conducted to assess the efficacy of buprenorphine as the only component of treatment.

In a double-blind placebo- and active-controlled study, 326 heroin-addicted subjects were randomly assigned to either buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets, 16/4 mg per day; buprenorphine sublingual tablets, 16 mg per day; or placebo sublingual tablets. For subjects randomized to either active treatment, dosing began with one 8 mg buprenorphine on day 1, followed by 16 mg (two 8 mg tablets) of buprenorphine on day 2. On day 3, those randomized to receive buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets were switched to the combination tablet. Subjects randomized to placebo received one placebo tablet on day 1 and two placebo tablets per day thereafter for four weeks.

### Mechanism-based pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling of the antinociceptive effect of buprenorphine in healthy volunteers [^115GJZdU]. Anesthesiology (2006). High credibility.

The objective of this investigation was to characterize the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relation of buprenorphine's antinociceptive effect in healthy volunteers.

- **Methods**: Data on the time course of the antinociceptive effect after intravenous administration of 0.05–0.6 mg/70 kg buprenorphine in healthy volunteers was analyzed in conjunction with plasma concentrations by nonlinear mixed-effects analysis.

- **Results**: A three-compartment pharmacokinetic model best described the concentration time course. Four structurally different pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models were evaluated for their appropriateness to describe the time course of buprenorphine's antinociceptive effect: (1) E(max) model with an effect compartment model, (2) "power" model with an effect compartment model, (3) receptor association-dissociation model with a linear transduction function, and (4) combined biophase equilibration/receptor association-dissociation model with a linear transduction function. The latter pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model described the time course of effect best and was used to explain time dependencies in buprenorphine's pharmacodynamics. The model converged, yielding precise estimation of the parameters characterizing hysteresis and the relation between relative receptor occupancy and antinociceptive effect. The rate constant describing biophase equilibration (k(eo)) was 0.00447 min(-1) (95% confidence interval, 0.00299–0.00595 min(-1)). The receptor dissociation rate constant (k(off)) was 0.0785 min(-1) (95% confidence interval, 0.0352–0.122 min(-1)).

### Different profiles of buprenorphine-induced analgesia and antihyperalgesia in a human pain model [^115G2rUC]. Pain (2005). Low credibility.

Different mechanisms were proposed for opioid-induced analgesia and antihyperalgesia, which might result in different pharmacodynamics. To address this issue, the time course of analgesic and antihyperalgesic effects of intravenous (i.v.) and sublingual (s.l.) buprenorphine was assessed in an experimental human pain model. Fifteen volunteers were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled cross-over study. The magnitude of pain and the area of secondary hyperalgesia following transcutaneous stimulation were repetitively assessed before and up to 150 minutes after administration of (1) 0.15 mg buprenorphine i.v. and placebo pill s.l., (2) 0.2 mg buprenorphine s.l. and saline 0.9% i.v., or (3) saline 0.9% i.v. and placebo pill s.l. as a control. The sessions were separated by 2-week wash-out periods. For both applications of buprenorphine, the antihyperalgesic effects were more pronounced compared to the analgesic effects (66 ± 9% vs. 26 ± 5% and 43 ± 10% vs. 10 ± 6%, for i.v. and s.l. application, respectively). This contrasts with the pattern for the intravenous administration of pure mu-receptor agonists in the same model, in which the antihyperalgesic effects are weaker. The apparent bioavailability of buprenorphine s.l. compared to buprenorphine i.v. was 58%, with a 15.8-minute later onset of antinociceptive effects. The half-life of buprenorphine-induced analgesic and antihyperalgesic effects were 171 and 288 minutes, respectively. In contrast to pure mu-receptor agonists, buprenorphine exerts a lasting antihyperalgesic effect in our model.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^112ocHcw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

- **Absorption**: In several pharmacokinetic studies following the administration of different dosages, a dose of one or two of the 2 mg/0.5 mg buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual films, administered sublingually or buccally, showed comparable relative bioavailability to the same total dose of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets. In contrast, one 8 mg/2 mg and one 12 mg/3 mg buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual films administered sublingually or buccally showed higher relative bioavailability for both buprenorphine and naloxone compared to the same total dose of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets.

	- A combination of one 8 mg/2 mg and two 2 mg/0.5 mg buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual films (total dose of 12 mg/3 mg) administered sublingually showed comparable relative bioavailability to the same total dose of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets, while buccally administered buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual films showed higher relative bioavailability.

	- Table 5 illustrates the relative increase in exposure to buprenorphine and naloxone associated with buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual films compared to buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets, and shows the effect of route of administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.9, 2.10)].

Across relevant pharmacokinetic studies, the pharmacokinetic parameters and exposures derived from the buccal and sublingual administrations of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film were comparable to one another.

### Buprenorphine [^113wqodH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In a pharmacokinetic study, buprenorphine plasma levels were found to be higher, and the half-life was found to be longer, in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, but not in subjects with mild hepatic impairment. For patients with severe hepatic impairment, a dose adjustment is recommended, and patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment should be monitored for signs and symptoms of toxicity or overdose caused by increased levels of buprenorphine [see Dosage and Administration (2.8), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

- **Dental adverse events**: Cases of dental caries, some severe (i.e. tooth fracture, tooth loss), have been reported following the use of transmucosal buprenorphine-containing products. Reported events include cavities, tooth decay, dental abscesses/infection, rampant caries, tooth erosion, fillings falling out, and, in some cases, total tooth loss. Treatment for these events included tooth extraction, root canal, dental surgery, as well as other restorative procedures (i.e. fillings, crowns, implants, dentures). Multiple cases were reported in individuals without any prior history of dental problems.

	- Refer patients to dental care services and encourage them to have regular dental checkups while taking buprenorphine sublingual tablets. Educate patients to seek dental care and strategies to maintain or improve oral health while being treated with transmucosal buprenorphine-containing products. Strategies include, but are not limited to, gently rinsing the teeth and gums with water.

### Systematic benefit-risk assessment for buprenorphine implant: A semiquantitative method to support risk management [^111UStku]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

We searched a variety of sources to identify suitable data for inclusion: PubMed, EMA website, FDA website, and the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). In PubMed, we searched for papers on 'buprenorphine' and 'implant' (n = 40), in addition to 'probuphine' (n = 12). Due to the low number of results, additional filters were not applied. The search strategy did not include 'Sixmo' as this brand name was not in use at the time of the search. Sublingual buprenorphine was the comparator of interest in all published studies. In addition, the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and Periodic Adverse Drug Experience Report for buprenorphine implant were obtained directly from the Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH).

Data were extracted from buprenorphine implant clinical trials (PRO-805, 806, and 814) and observational studies/data sets for each benefit and risk, for both buprenorphine implant and the comparator (sublingual buprenorphine).

In comparison to the sublingual formulation of buprenorphine, the key systemic adverse events and benefits reported with buprenorphine implant do not differ significantly as they are associated with buprenorphine use regardless of the method of administration. Consequently, the key benefits and risks of interest with buprenorphine implant are those related to the implant formulation, which includes the risk of implant site reactions. The value tree was subsequently refined to reflect this, alongside the removal of benefits and risks for which insufficient data were available.

### Zubsolv [^1149yk31]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In specific populations, hepatic impairment affects the pharmacokinetic disposition of buprenorphine and naloxone. A study assessed these parameters after administering a Suboxone 2.0 mg/0.5 mg (buprenorphine/naloxone) sublingual tablet to subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment, categorized using the Child-Pugh criteria. The disposition in patients with hepatic impairment was compared to those with normal hepatic function.

- **Mild hepatic impairment**: In these subjects, changes in mean Cmax, AUC0-last, and half-life values for both buprenorphine and naloxone were not clinically significant. Consequently, no dosing adjustment is required.

- **Moderate and severe hepatic impairment**: Here, the mean Cmax, AUC0-last, and half-life values for both drugs were increased, with naloxone being more affected than buprenorphine. The magnitude of these effects was greater in patients with severe hepatic impairment than those with moderate impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

- **HCV infection**: In subjects with HCV infection but without signs of hepatic impairment, changes in mean Cmax, AUC0-last, and half-life values for buprenorphine and naloxone were not clinically significant compared to healthy subjects without HCV infection.

### Opioid metabolism and drug-drug interaction in cancer [^115Dozfa]. The Oncologist (2024). Low credibility.

Most of the identified opioid DDIs from the DDI-checker are related to their CYP metabolism, mainly involving CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, and few are related to glucuronidation by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT).

- **Buprenorphine**: Buprenorphine is metabolized through N-dealkylation via CYP3A4 to form the active metabolite norbuprenorphine. Both buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine are further modified through glucuronidation by UGT2B7 and UGT1A1, respectively. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the μ opioid receptor and an antagonist at the κ opioid receptor. Like other μ agonists, it may cause respiratory depression, miosis, and mood changes, in addition to analgesia. However, regarding respiratory outcome, there appears to be a ceiling effect with high doses. Norbuprenorphine is a potent agonist of μ, δ, and κ opioid receptors and, in animal models, may cause greater respiratory depression while having reduced antinociception, compared with buprenorphine.

According to the DDI-checker, buprenorphine DDIs that have not been studied but may be clinically significant involve co-administration with enzalutamide, imatinib, and ribociclib. Enzalutamide is a strong CYP3A4 inducer and can also induce UGT1A1. This may increase the formation of active buprenorphine metabolites, leading to toxicity. Imatinib and ribociclib (both CYP3A4 inhibitors) may increase concentrations of buprenorphine and decrease norbuprenorphine. Co-administration, if unavoidable, should be closely monitored for buprenorphine toxicity.

### Mechanism of autoinduction of methadone N-demethylation in human hepatocytes [^117ShkNU]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2013). Low credibility.

There is considerable interindividual and intraindividual variability in methadone metabolism and clearance. Methadone dosing is particularly challenging during the initiation of therapy because of time-dependent increases in hepatic clearance (autoinduction). Although methadone N-demethylation is catalyzed in vitro by cytochrome P4502B6 (CYP2B6) and CYP3A4, and clearance in vivo depends on CYP2B6, the mechanism(s) of autoinduction are incompletely understood. In this investigation, we determined the mechanism(s) of methadone autoinduction using human hepatocytes.

- **Methods**: Fresh human hepatocytes were exposed to 0.1 to 10 µM methadone for 72 hours. Cells were washed and methadone N-demethylation assessed. CYP2B6, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 messenger RNA (mRNA), protein expression (by gel-free high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry), and catalytic activity (bupropion hydroxylation and alfentanil dealkylation for CYP2B6 and CYP3A4/5, respectively) were measured. Mechanisms of CYP induction were characterized using pregnane X receptor and constitutive androstane receptor reporter gene assays.

- **Results**: Methadone (10 µM) increased methadone N-demethylation 2-fold, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 mRNA 3-fold, and protein expression 2-fold. CYP3A5 mRNA was unchanged. CYP2B6 and CYP3A4/5 activities increased 2-fold. Induction by methadone enantiomers (R-methadone versus S-methadone) did not differ. Induction was relatively weak compared with maximum induction by phenobarbital and rifampin. Lower methadone concentrations had smaller effects. Methadone was an agonist for the pregnane X receptor.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^117SMBnD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Use in patients with impaired hepatic function**: Buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for those with moderate hepatic impairment. The doses of buprenorphine and naloxone in this fixed-dose combination cannot be individually titrated, and hepatic impairment results in a significantly reduced clearance of naloxone compared to buprenorphine. Thus, patients with severe hepatic impairment will have substantially higher levels of naloxone than those with normal hepatic function, increasing the risk of precipitated withdrawal during treatment initiation and potentially interfering with buprenorphine's efficacy throughout treatment. In moderate hepatic impairment, although naloxone clearance is reduced compared to buprenorphine clearance, buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended for treatment initiation due to the increased risk of precipitated withdrawal. However, they may be cautiously used for maintenance treatment in these patients if treatment was initiated with a buprenorphine product without naloxone. Close monitoring is required, considering the possibility of naloxone interfering with buprenorphine's efficacy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

- **Dental adverse events**: Cases of dental adverse events associated with buprenorphine/naloxone use have been reported.

### Frequencies of clinically important CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 alleles are graded across Europe [^113HD9NJ]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2020). Low credibility.

Interindividual variability in therapeutic drug response can result in adverse drug reactions (ADRs) or lack of efficacy and constitutes a key challenge for healthcare systems. Notably, 40–70% of patients experience insufficient drug response or drug toxicity, and ADRs account for 6.5% of all hospital admissions, of which up to 30% are life-threatening in at-risk subpopulations. Genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporters, or drug targets explain around 20–30% of these interindividual differences.

Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes constitute a polymorphic superfamily, consisting of 57 functional members in humans, that metabolize over 80% of all clinically used medications. Among these, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 are of particular clinical relevance, as they are highly polymorphic and implicated in the metabolism of numerous widely prescribed drugs. CYP2C19 substrates include the tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin, and imipramine; the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors citalopram and sertraline; the antifungal voriconazole; as well as the antiplatelet agent clopidogrel.

CYP2C19*2 (rs4244285) is the most common allelic variant in Caucasians and results in aberrant splicing and loss-of-enzyme activity. In contrast, the regulatory polymorphism rs12248560, defining CYP2C19*17, increases transcriptional activity and causes the ultrarapid CYP2C19 metabolism.

### Geneva cocktail for cytochrome P450 and P-glycoprotein activity assessment using dried blood spots [^116bY5Xb]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

The CYP2B6 enzyme is involved in the metabolism of approximately 8% of clinically used drugs, including bupropion, efavirenz, methadone, propofol, cyclophosphamide, and tamoxifen. Despite its significance in drug metabolism, most previously published cocktails did not include a probe for assessing CYP2B6 activity. As suggested by individual CYP2B6-phenotyping studies and the European Medicines Agency, bupropion was used as a probe drug in our cocktail.

As expected, the administration of voriconazole potently inhibited CYP2B6 and resulted in a 1.3-fold increase in bupropion AUC, which aligns with previously published studies. Rifampicin-mediated induction led to an approximately threefold decrease in bupropion AUC, as previously observed. The inhibition and induction were more pronounced when the OH-bup/bup AUC last ratio or single-point MRs were used as phenotyping indexes. At each session, AUC last ratios most strongly correlated with DBS MRs at 4 hours (ρ s ≥ 0.927; P < 0.001). Significant correlations were also observed at 1, 3, and 6 hours.

### Interactions between buprenorphine and antiretrovirals. II. The protease inhibitors nelfinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ritonavir [^115MngaU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

We examined drug interactions between buprenorphine, an opioid partial agonist available by prescription for the treatment of opioid dependence, and the protease inhibitors (PIs) nelfinavir (NFV), ritonavir (RTV), and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/R). Opioid-dependent, buprenorphine/naloxone-maintained, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative volunteers (n = 10 per PI) participated in 24-hour pharmacokinetic studies, before and after the administration of each PI. Symptoms of opiate withdrawal and excess were determined before and after PI administration.

PI pharmacokinetics were assessed and compared between opiate-dependent participants and healthy control participants (n = 15 per PI). Administration of RTV, but not of NFV or LPV/R, resulted in a significant increase in the buprenorphine area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). However, symptoms of opiate excess were not observed. Buprenorphine had no significant effects on PI AUC. Adjustments of doses of either buprenorphine or NFV, LPV/R, or RTV are not likely to be necessary when these drugs are administered for the treatment of opioid dependence and HIV disease.

### Genostar: An R package for genotype to star allele conversion for major cytochrome P450 family of genes [^114PddJL]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacogenomics enables the personalization of drug therapy by linking genetic variations to differences in drug metabolism, efficacy, and risk of adverse reactions. Genetic polymorphisms within cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes significantly affect enzyme activity, influencing drug plasma levels, responses, and safety. Central to this process is accurate genotype-to-phenotype translation, especially for the CYP enzyme family, which metabolizes 70–80% of clinically used drugs. To address this, we have developed GenoStaR, an R package that converts genotypes into star alleles and predicts the associated metabolizer status for major cytochrome P450 genes — CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5.

GenoStaR assigns star alleles using single-nucleotide polymorphisms, insertion-deletion variants, and structural variants. Given genotype data, GenoStaR uses comprehensive allele definition tables to determine diplotypes, activity scores, and predicted metabolizer status. The tool accounts for complex scenarios, including CYP2D6 copy number variations, using a tiered matching strategy and structural variant detection.

We evaluated GenoStaR using two datasets:

- **The IMPACT study dataset**: This data from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health Individualized Medicine: Pharmacogenetics Assessment and Clinical Treatment (n = 8,287) included genotyping data, along with star allele information from a commercial pharmacogenetic test.

- **The Toronto Schizophrenia sample**: This dataset (n = 188) included in-house genotype data and manually validated star alleles.

GenoStaR achieved 100% concordance in both datasets evaluated.

### Role of CYP2B6 in stereoselective human methadone metabolism [^115knkU9]. Anesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

The metabolism and clearance of racemic methadone are stereoselective and highly variable, yet the mechanism remains largely unknown. Initial in vitro studies attributed methadone metabolism to cytochrome P4503A4 (CYP3A4). CYP3A4 was also assumed responsible for methadone clearance in vivo. Nevertheless, recent clinical data do not support a primary role for CYP3A4 and suggest that CYP2B6 may mediate methadone clearance. Expressed CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 N-demethylate methadone in vitro. This investigation tested the hypothesis that CYPs 2B6, 3A4, and/or 2C19 are responsible for stereoselective methadone metabolism in human liver microsomes and in vivo.

- **Methods**: N-demethylation of racemic methadone and individual enantiomers by expressed CYPs 2B6, 2C19, and 3A4 was evaluated. Stereoselective microsomal methadone metabolism was quantified, compared with CYP 2B6 and 3A4 content, and probed using CYP isoform-selective inhibitors. A crossover clinical investigation (control, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 induction by rifampin, CYP3A inhibition by troleandomycin and grapefruit juice) evaluated stereoselective methadone disposition.

- **Results**: At clinical concentrations, methadone enantiomer N-demethylation by recombinant CYPs 2B6, 3A4, and 2C19 was observed as S > R, S = R, and S < R, respectively. Liver microsomes from subjects with high levels of CYP2B6 compared with CYP3A4 showed enhanced S-enantiomer metabolism compared to the R-enantiomer (S > R). Clopidogrel, troleandomycin, and (+)-N-3-benzyl-nirvanol, selective inhibitors of CYPs 2B6, 3A4, and 2C19, respectively, inhibited microsomal methadone metabolism by 50–60%, 20–30%, and less than 10%, respectively.

### Opioid metabolism and drug-drug interaction in cancer [^113ZgSu8]. The Oncologist (2024). Low credibility.

Methadone is primarily metabolized through demethylation by CYP2B6 and also via CYP3A4. According to the DDI-checker, enzalutamide, ribociclib, imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib potentially have clinically significant interactions with methadone.

- **Drug interactions**:
	- Methadone-related toxicity may cause sedation, respiratory depression, and QT prolongation associated with the risk of potentially fatal torsades de pointes and arrhythmias; therefore, close monitoring including electrocardiogram (ECG) assessment is recommended, with dose adjustment based on the observed effects.

	- **Enzalutamide**:
		Enzalutamide should not be coadministered with methadone. Its strong CYP3A4 induction may significantly reduce methadone concentrations and thereby decrease analgesia.

	- **Ribociclib**:
		As a dose-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4, ribociclib may increase methadone concentrations and is also a QT prolonging agent (linked to the risk of potentially fatal torsades de pointes and arrhythmias), which contraindicates coadministration at higher doses. *Coadministration of ribociclib with methadone is contraindicated due to QT prolongation.

	- **Imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib**:
		Methadone concentrations may also increase when coadministered with dasatinib, nilotinib, and imatinib, which are all weak/moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors.

### Clinical pharmacogenetics implementation consortium guideline for CYP2B6 genotype and methadone therapy [^111Nuavu]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). High credibility.

There are some important limitations to CYP2B6 genetic tests, as previously described in the Genetic Test Interpretation section. Based on clinical consequences for methadone of known variant alleles, this might not be clinically relevant for methadone. Therefore, it is important that clinical providers appreciate the limitations of targeted genotyping tests and understand which CYP2B6 variant alleles were and were not genotyped by a testing laboratory when interpreting results. In addition to altered activity of genetic variants, CYP2B6 is highly susceptible to induction and inhibition. Thus, clinical activity (including that of allelic variants) will reflect the influence of genetics and environment (drug interactions).

### Strategy for effective analgesia with intravenous buprenorphine in patients with acute postoperative pain [^113XKUr1]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine is a mild analgesic opioid that falls under the category of partial mu (µ) receptor agonists. The drug is available in several forms, including a transdermal system, lozenge tablets, and an injectable solution. In 1982, the FDA approved the injectable solution for treating acute pain of moderate to severe intensity. This solution is designed for intramuscular delivery or slow intravenous injection. Buprenorphine is provided as a clear liquid, containing 0.3 mg of the drug per milliliter. It reaches its maximum plasma concentration within 5 to 15 minutes, with a duration of action estimated to last 6 hours or more. A literature review by Hale et al. confirms that intravenous buprenorphine is effective for pain relief, showing comparable or superior efficacy to morphine in managing postoperative pain.

Posso-Sierra et al. reported on the evaluation of the analgesic efficacy of buprenorphine in treating acute postoperative pain in patients who have undergone thoracic surgery. They highlight the importance of buprenorphine in pain management. The study indicates that a multimodal approach to pain treatment following thoracoscopic surgery helps to reduce pain intensity. Buprenorphine, administered at doses of 1 to 3 µg/kg body weight, does not cause nausea, vomiting, rash, or respiratory depression. The researchers found that using buprenorphine at doses of 2 and 3 µg/kg body weight allows for better pain control, resulting in more effective analgesia.

Buresh et al. noted that treating acute postoperative pain in patients who have been using buprenorphine chronically poses unique challenges.

### The effect of cytochrome P450 metabolism on drug response, interactions, and adverse effects [^113WsG6s]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Cytochrome P450 enzymes are essential for the metabolism of many medications. Although this class has more than 50 enzymes, six of them metabolize 90 percent of drugs, with the two most significant enzymes being CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Genetic variability (polymorphism) in these enzymes may influence a patient's response to commonly prescribed drug classes, including beta blockers and antidepressants.

Cytochrome P450 enzymes can be inhibited or induced by drugs, resulting in clinically significant drug-drug interactions that can cause unanticipated adverse reactions or therapeutic failures. Interactions with warfarin, antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, and statins often involve the cytochrome P450 enzymes.

Knowledge of the most important drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, as well as the most potent inhibiting and inducing drugs, can help minimize the possibility of adverse drug reactions and interactions. Although genotype tests can determine if a patient has a specific enzyme polymorphism, it has not been determined if routine use of these tests will improve outcomes.

### Prevalence estimates of cytochrome P450 phenoconversion in youth receiving pharmacotherapy for mental health conditions [^112XZiVD]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

Pharmacogenetics‐predicted drug metabolism may not match clinically observed metabolism due to a phenomenon known as phenoconversion. Phenoconversion can occur when an inhibitor or inducer of a drug‐metabolizing enzyme is present. Although estimates of phenoconversion in adult populations are available, prevalence estimates in youth populations are limited. To address this gap, we estimated the prevalence of phenoconversion in 1281 youth (6–24 years) receiving pharmacotherapy for mental health conditions and who had pharmacogenetics testing completed for four genes (CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). Self‐reported medication and cannabidiol/cannabis use were collected at the time of pharmacogenetics testing. Nearly half (46%) of the cohort was estimated to be phenoconverted for one of the four genes examined.

Comparison of metabolizer phenotype frequencies before and after adjustment for phenoconversion showed significantly more youth had actionable phenotypes for CYP2C19 (60.3% vs. 69.1%; P ≤ 0.001), CYP2D6 (49.3% vs. 63.0%; P ≤ 0.001), and CYP3A4 (8.5% vs. 12.2%; P = 0.003) after phenoconversion adjustment. Of youth who were phenoconverted, 24% had a change in their metabolizer phenotype that would lead to pharmacogenetics‐based prescribing guidelines recommending a change to standard prescribing (dose adjustment, alternative medication). Our findings indicate a high prevalence of cytochrome P450 phenoconversion among youth receiving pharmacotherapy for mental health conditions. Adjustment for phenoconversion should be considered when implementing pharmacogenetic guidelines.

### Pharmacokinetic interactions between buprenorphine and antiretroviral medications [^112c2XNd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine is used for the treatment of opioid dependence. As the number of persons receiving buprenorphine treatment and antiretroviral therapy continues to grow, so too does the existence and clinical impact of drug interactions between buprenorphine and medications for treating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Awareness that such interactions exist may deter some patients and physicians from initiating potentially lifesaving therapy or lead to complications among patients whose treatment is already underway. Complications include nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy and the development of viral resistance.

Illicit drug use is a frequent consequence of adverse drug effects experienced by injection drug users. The occurrence of unrecognized drug interactions can lead to unsuccessful therapy for HIV infection and the treatment of substance dependence. The present review is organized to provide a working background of buprenorphine pharmacology followed by a review of the state of knowledge regarding specific interactions between buprenorphine and antiretrovirals. A discussion of the clinical applicability of these interactions concludes the review.

### Transplacental transfer and metabolism of buprenorphine in preterm human placenta [^112Nf2bm]. American Journal of Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

We sought to determine whether gestational age affects the transplacental transfer and metabolism of buprenorphine (BUP). Transfer of BUP (10 ng/mL) and its [³H]-isotope was determined across placentas of 30 to 34 weeks of gestation utilizing the technique of dual perfusion of placental lobule. The concentration of the drug in trophoblast tissue and in maternal and fetal circuits was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Microsomes prepared from placentas of 17 to 37 weeks of gestation were divided into three groups: late second, early third, and late third trimesters. Antibodies raised against human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms were utilized to identify the enzyme(s) catalyzing BUP biotransformation by preterm placental microsomes. The amount of norbuprenorphine formed was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). BUP transfer across the placentas of 30 to 34 weeks of gestation was similar to those at term. CYP19 antibodies caused 60% inhibition of BUP metabolism by microsomes of late second and early third trimesters and 85% by microsomes of late third trimester. The developmental changes occurring in the human placenta between 30 weeks of gestation through term do not affect the transfer of BUP across the human placenta. CYP19 is the major enzyme responsible for the biotransformation of BUP beginning at 17 weeks of gestation until term.

### Buprenorphine [^1116cFb9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Maintenance**: Buprenorphine and naloxone are preferred for maintenance treatment. In cases where buprenorphine is used alone for patients who cannot tolerate naloxone, the dosage should be progressively adjusted in increments or decrements of 2 mg or 4 mg. This adjustment aims to maintain treatment effectiveness and suppress opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms. Following induction and stabilization, the maintenance dose of buprenorphine sublingual tablets typically ranges from 4 mg to 24 mg per day, depending on the individual's needs. The recommended target dosage is 16 mg as a single daily dose, as dosages higher than 24 mg have not shown any additional clinical benefit. When prescribing for unsupervised administration, consider the patient's stability, home security, and factors affecting their capability to manage take-home medication. There is no maximum recommended duration for maintenance treatment — patients may require indefinite treatment, continuing as long as they benefit and the medication contributes to their treatment goals.

- **Method of administration**: Buprenorphine sublingual tablets must be administered whole. Advise patients not to cut, chew, or swallow the tablets and to avoid eating or drinking until the tablet is completely dissolved.

### Buprenorphine pharmacology review: Update on transmucosal and long-acting formulations [^112mtRdH]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine is an effective treatment for opioid use disorder. As a high-affinity, partial agonist for the mu-opioid receptor, it suppresses opioid withdrawal and craving, reduces illicit opioid use, and blocks exogenous opioid effects, including respiratory depression. Other pharmacologic benefits include its superior safety profile compared with full opioid agonists and its long half-life, allowing for daily or less-than-daily dosing. New and innovative buprenorphine formulations, with pharmacokinetic profiles that differ from the original tablet formulation, continue to be developed. These include higher bioavailability transmucosal tablets and films, as well as 6-month implantable and monthly injectable products. This growing array of available formulations provides more choices for patients and offers increased opportunities for clinicians to individualize treatment. Thus, it is important for buprenorphine prescribers to understand these differences.

### Strategy for effective analgesia with intravenous buprenorphine in patients with acute postoperative pain [^113EvXnP]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Low credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine reveal that it binds to plasma proteins at a rate of 96% and crosses the blood-brain barrier, reaching a concentration that is 15–25% of that found in plasma. The drug is extensively distributed throughout the body, penetrating bone and adipose tissue. Buprenorphine undergoes hepatic metabolism primarily by the enzyme CYP3A4, which metabolizes about 30% of it to norbuprenorphine. Norbuprenorphine acts as a weak agonist at mu (µ), kappa (κ), delta (δ), and nociceptin receptors, and combines with glucuronic acid to form the inactive metabolites buprenorphine-3-glucuronide and norbuprenorphine-3-glucuronide. Norbuprenorphine has an analgesic effect that is approximately 40 times weaker than buprenorphine and exhibits significantly lower lipophilicity. Buprenorphine passes through the blood-brain barrier more weakly. The use of drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 may alter the efficacy and effects of buprenorphine by reducing or increasing its analgesic effect. Both buprenorphine and its metabolites are excreted via bile into the gastrointestinal tract, with approximately 70% of the drug being eliminated unchanged; the remainder is excreted through urine. In patients with hepatic insufficiency, both the duration and potency of buprenorphine may be altered. Therefore, carefully monitoring these patients for any adverse or toxic effects is essential.

In contrast, the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine remain unchanged in individuals with renal failure, allowing for the drug to be safely used in this group.

### Opioid metabolism and drug-drug interaction in cancer [^115ZDieq]. The Oncologist (2024). Low credibility.

Opioids included buprenorphine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, and tramadol. Anticancer drugs encompassed chemotherapeutics such as taxanes (specifically paclitaxel and docetaxel), platinum agents (specifically oxaliplatin, carboplatin, and cisplatin), oxazophosphorines (specifically cyclophosphamide), and vinca alkaloids (specifically vincristine). Additionally, targeted therapies included TKIs like dasatinib, gefitinib, imatinib, and nilotinib; biologics like atezolizumab, nivolumab, and trastuzumab; cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors such as palbociclib and ribociclib; estrogen receptor modulators like tamoxifen; steroid hormones like abiraterone; and nonsteroidal antiandrogens like enzalutamide.

- **Ddi terms**: Included drug interaction(s), drug-drug interaction(s), drug antagonism, polypharmacy, drug synergism(s), drug potentiation(s), drug augmentation(s), drug toxicity, drug competition, drug inhibition, and drug intoxication.

Findings from the DDI-checker were manually compared to observations from the literature search to identify clinical evidence for potential DDIs. The authors' expert views on the use of internet checker tools and databases in assessing DDIs and guiding treatment decisions in clinical practice were compiled and summarized in the Expert Opinion section.

### Buprenorphine TTS for children — a review of the drug's clinical pharmacology [^113nGVYM]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

The transdermal therapeutic system (TTS) with buprenorphine is currently being used 'off-label' to treat chronic pediatric pain. We compiled available pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and clinical pediatric data on buprenorphine to rationalize treatment regimens.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic biomedical literature review focusing on pediatric buprenorphine data.

- **Results**: There are few relevant pediatric buprenorphine data, particularly in children suffering from chronic pain. There are no pediatric PK and PD data for children with chronic pain given sublingual or TTS formulations. Children given a single dose of buprenorphine have increased drug clearance referenced to body weight with a possible paradoxical longer duration of action. Buprenorphine metabolism is independent of renal function, which is advantageous in renal insufficiency. The risk of respiratory depression after buprenorphine is difficult to quantify. A concentration-response relationship for respiratory effects has not been described, and it is unknown whether children have a ceiling effect similar to that described in healthy adult volunteers.

- **Conclusions**: Buprenorphine is of interest in pediatric postoperative pain and cancer pain control because of its multiple administration routes, long duration of action, and metabolism largely independent of renal function. There is little reason to expect buprenorphine effects in children out of infancy to be fundamentally different from those in adults. From the limited pediatric data available, it appears that buprenorphine has no higher adverse potential in children.

### Converting from transdermal to buccal formulations of buprenorphine: A pharmacokinetic meta-model simulation in healthy volunteers [^112hEo7V]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

To develop a model to predict buprenorphine plasma concentrations during the transition from transdermal to buccal administration, a population pharmacokinetic model-based meta-analysis of published data was conducted.

A model-based meta-analysis of available buprenorphine pharmacokinetic data in healthy adults was performed. Aggregate (mean) data were extracted from published literature to explore potential conversion from transdermal to buccal buprenorphine. The time course of mean buprenorphine plasma concentrations following the application of transdermal patches or buccal films was digitized from available literature. A meta-model was developed using specific pharmacokinetic parameters such as absorption rate, apparent clearance, and volumes of distribution derived from the analysis of pharmacokinetic data for intravenously, transdermally, and buccally administered buprenorphine.

Data from six studies were included in this analysis.

- **Transdermal absorption model**: The final model employed a zero-order input rate scaled to reflect a nominal patch delivery rate and time after patch application, showing a decline in rate over time. The transdermal absorption rate constant became zero following patch removal.

- **Buccal absorption process**: A first-order process with a time lag and bioavailability term. Simulations of conversion from transdermal 20 mcg/h and 10 mcg/h to buccal administration suggest that the transition can be made rapidly (beginning 12 hours after patch removal) using the recommended buccal formulation titration increments (75–150 mcg) and schedule (every four days).

### Buprenorphine in cancer pain [^113uwMGM]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine is a broad-spectrum, highly lipophilic, and long-acting partial mu-opioid receptor agonist that is non-cross tolerant to other opioids. Buprenorphine can be administered through several routes. Its metabolism occurs via CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and conjugases. Constipation and sexual dysfunction appear to be less frequent with buprenorphine compared to other opioids. The recent development of a polymer matrix patch delivery system for buprenorphine prevents "dose dumping" and facilitates pain management in patients unable to take oral analgesics. Additionally, sublingual buprenorphine has been combined with naloxone to prevent illicit conversion to parenteral administration. Buprenorphine has been used extensively to control cancer pain. In certain clinical situations, it may offer particular advantages over other opioids.
