## Question

What could cause chronic pelvic pain in a 30-year-old female?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what could cause chronic pelvic pain in a 30-year-old female. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define chronic pelvic pain and frame the clinical problem. Then, I should organize the differential by organ system and highlight the most common contributors in reproductive-age women. Next, I will integrate the concept of multifactorial pain and central sensitization. After that, I should outline a practical, guideline-based evaluation strategy. Finally, I will synthesize the key takeaways and emphasize red flags and when to escalate care, making sure I verify each claim against high-quality sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and scope so I don't anchor prematurely. Chronic pelvic pain is generally defined as noncyclic pelvic pain lasting at least 6 months that causes functional impairment or requires medical care, and it affects roughly 15–26% of women of reproductive age, which underscores its prevalence and clinical importance in a 30-year-old patient [^111cKoov] [^113bC55r].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single cause; I need to structure the differential by organ system to avoid missing overlapping contributors. The major categories include gynecologic, urologic, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal/neurologic, and psychosocial, and guidelines consistently emphasize that multiple pain generators often coexist, so I should keep that front and center as I proceed [^115nQ1PP] [^113gcE3J].

> I will now examine gynecologic etiologies, which are common in this age group. Endometriosis is the leading cause, with prevalence around 70% in CPP cohorts, and adenomyosis, leiomyomas, and adnexal pathology also contribute; importantly, pain severity correlates poorly with disease extent, so normal imaging does not exclude endometriosis, and I should maintain a high index of suspicion when symptoms are cyclical or dyspareunia is prominent [^116LRbR1] [^116ZNJpy]. Wait, let me verify the cyclical pattern clue: RCOG notes that marked menstrual variation should raise suspicion for hormonally driven disease, which aligns with endometriosis and adenomyosis patterns, so I should ask explicitly about cycle-related fluctuations and dyspareunia [^113m8tQF].

> Next, I should review urologic contributors, particularly bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis, which is highly prevalent in CPP populations and frequently overlaps with endometriosis. I need to check for urinary frequency, urgency, and bladder pain relieved by voiding, and remember that overactive bladder and urethral diverticulum can mimic or coexist with BPS, so a careful history and targeted exam are essential before labeling BPS [^116LRbR1] [^116iLtBW]. But wait, what if I over-attribute urinary symptoms to BPS? I should double-check for infection, stones, or masses if the story is atypical or if hematuria is present to avoid missing treatable alternatives [^116iLtBW].

> Let me consider gastrointestinal etiologies next. Irritable bowel syndrome is common in CPP and often overlaps with pelvic pain, so I should screen for altered bowel habits, bloating, and pain relieved by defecation; diverticulitis and inflammatory bowel disease can also present with chronic pelvic pain and should be considered when red flags like weight loss, bleeding, or anemia are present [^116LRbR1] [^117LQiNi]. I should confirm that symptom-based diagnostic criteria are acceptable for IBS in the right context, which RCOG supports, while still ruling out alarm features that would prompt colonoscopy or other testing [^113FAiit].

> I need to check musculoskeletal and neurologic contributors carefully because they are frequently overlooked yet very common. Pelvic floor muscle dysfunction, including high-tone pelvic floor disorder, is present in 60–90% of CPP patients and can be primary or secondary to visceral drivers; myofascial trigger points, abdominal wall pain, and pudendal neuralgia should be assessed on exam with palpation and specific maneuvers like Carnett's and FABER, and early pelvic floor physical therapy is recommended when hypertonicity or trigger points are found [^114hE4Hx] [^111rQN7q]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines endorse myofascial release and biofeedback as first-line for pelvic floor dysfunction; yes, EAU recommends myofascial release and supports biofeedback in selected anal pain syndromes, which reinforces the value of nonpharmacologic pelvic floor therapy [^115LkuhN] [^113FoixX].

> Let me think about psychosocial and central sensitization, because these often modulate pain severity and treatment response. Depression, anxiety, pain catastrophizing, and trauma exposure are more prevalent in CPP and independently associate with greater pain severity; central sensitization helps explain why multiple modest peripheral generators can produce disproportionate pain, and addressing these factors improves outcomes in interdisciplinary programs [^113g3qb7] [^113bC55r]. I should confirm that guidelines advise early screening for mood, sleep, and trauma, and yes, EAU and ACOG recommend assessing functional, emotional, behavioral, and sexual domains early in care, with trauma-informed approaches to reduce harm and improve engagement [^112CHp6U] [^112zgkdE].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "80% of CPP is non-gynecologic", but I should double-check that statistic. The JAMA review notes that in some series, the origin is not gynecologic in up to 80% of patients, yet other data show endometriosis in about 70% of CPP cohorts; reconciling this, the key is that CPP is multifactorial and often involves multiple systems, so even when endometriosis is present, non-gynecologic pain generators frequently contribute to symptom burden, which is why a biopsychosocial, multidisciplinary approach is emphasized [^113bC55r] [^116LRbR1]. I should correct my earlier overstatement and frame it as high rates of non-gynecologic contributors rather than asserting a fixed 80% non-gynecologic proportion across all studies [^113bC55r].

> Next, I should review a practical evaluation strategy. I need to ensure a thorough biopsychosocial history covering pain chronology, menstrual and sexual correlates, bowel and bladder symptoms, prior surgeries and trauma, and psychosocial stressors, followed by a focused exam including abdominal wall, musculoskeletal pelvis, and pelvic floor assessment; routine labs and imaging are low yield unless guided by findings, but transvaginal ultrasound is reasonable to exclude structural disease when indicated [^113ESTm2] [^114KtnRC]. Hold on, I should verify when laparoscopy is appropriate; diagnostic laparoscopy is second-line after noninvasive evaluation fails or when endometriosis is strongly suspected and will change management, and conscious pain mapping can refine findings in select cases [^117TEJHZ] [^117CcrBM].

> I will now examine management principles, keeping the multifactorial nature in mind. Multimodal, interdisciplinary care that treats peripheral generators and central drivers yields the best outcomes; this includes pain education, pelvic floor physical therapy, behavioral therapies, and pharmacotherapy such as SNRIs or gabapentinoids for neuropathic features, while avoiding routine opioids and reserving surgery for well-selected disease-specific indications rather than for undifferentiated CPP [^111rQN7q] [^116R8rhg]. Wait, let me verify the role of gabapentin; the GaPP2 RCT did not show benefit for gabapentin in women with CPP and no obvious pathology, so I should not overpromise on gabapentin and should individualize based on neuropathic features and risk–benefit profile [^1177tcB4].

> Let me reconsider the synthesis to ensure internal consistency. In a 30-year-old woman with CPP, the most likely scenario is multifactorial pain with at least one gynecologic driver such as endometriosis or adenomyosis, plus one or more non-gynecologic contributors like bladder pain syndrome, IBS, pelvic floor dysfunction, or central sensitization with mood or trauma comorbidity; this is why a single-organ approach often fails and why interdisciplinary care is repeatedly recommended across high-quality guidelines [^115nQ1PP] [^113bC55r]. I should confirm that this framing aligns with prevalence data and guideline direction, and yes, the overlap of endometriosis and BPS around 48% in CPP cohorts, along with high rates of musculoskeletal findings, supports this multifactorial model and the need for parallel, not sequential, addressing of drivers [^116LRbR1] [^113bC55r].

> Finally, I need to ensure I flag red flags and escalation triggers. Unexplained weight loss, postmenopausal bleeding, focal neurologic deficits, or nonresponse to appropriate multimodal therapy should prompt reconsideration of malignancy, infection, spinal pathology, or rare neurologic causes, and early referral to pain medicine, urology, gastroenterology, or gynecology subspecialists is appropriate when progress stalls or disease-specific therapy is indicated [^112hfPZd] [^111rQN7q]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines emphasize ruling out confusable diseases early; yes, EAU advises early exclusion of cancer, infection, trauma, and spinal disorders, which reinforces the need to balance reassurance with vigilance in the initial evaluation [^112hfPZd].

Chronic pelvic pain in a 30-year-old female is most often **multifactorial** [^113bC55r], with gynecologic causes (endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, chronic PID) [^116LRbR1], urologic (interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome) [^116iLtBW], gastrointestinal (IBS, IBD) [^117LQiNi], musculoskeletal (pelvic floor dysfunction, myofascial pain) [^114hE4Hx], and neurologic/psychologic contributors (central sensitization, anxiety, depression, trauma) [^1128z1K1] [^116s71yd]. Evaluation should be **biopsychosocial** [^113ESTm2], starting with a detailed history and focused exam [^112zgkdE], then tailoring labs and imaging (ultrasound first) [^114KtnRC] to findings. Management is **multidisciplinary** [^116R8rhg], combining medical, physical, psychological, and lifestyle therapies; surgery is reserved for refractory cases or identifiable pathology [^117TEJHZ].

---

## Gynecologic causes

- **Endometriosis**: Present in ~70% of CPP cases [^116LRbR1]; cyclical pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, infertility [^116ZNJpy].
- **Adenomyosis**: Cyclical pain, heavy periods, uterine enlargement [^notfound].
- **Uterine fibroids**: Pressure, bulk symptoms, dysmenorrhea [^notfound].
- **Chronic pelvic inflammatory disease**: Persistent pain, adhesions, infertility [^114n3fop].
- **Ovarian cysts/masses**: Pressure, torsion, or rupture-related pain [^notfound].

---

## Urologic causes

- **Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome**: Frequency, urgency, bladder pain relieved by voiding [^116iLtBW].
- **Chronic urinary tract infections**: Recurrent pain, frequency, dysuria [^notfound].
- **Urethral syndrome**: Urethral pain, frequency, dysuria [^notfound].

---

## Gastrointestinal causes

- **Irritable bowel syndrome**: Bloating, altered bowel habits, pain relieved by defecation [^notfound].
- **Inflammatory bowel disease**: Crampy pain, diarrhea, weight loss, rectal bleeding [^notfound].
- **Constipation**: Colicky pain, bloating, straining [^notfound].

---

## Musculoskeletal and neurologic causes

- **Pelvic floor dysfunction**: Hypertonicity, trigger points, dyspareunia, urinary/fecal dysfunction [^114hE4Hx].
- **Myofascial pain syndrome**: Referred pain from abdominal wall or pelvic floor trigger points [^111rQN7q].
- **Pudendal neuralgia**: Sitting pain, genital/perineal numbness, dyspareunia [^notfound].
- **Central sensitization**: Amplified pain perception, comorbid chronic pain syndromes [^1128z1K1].

---

## Psychological and social factors

Psychological and social factors include **anxiety and depression**, which are common and amplify pain and disability [^113g3qb7] [^116LRbR1]. A history of **sexual or physical abuse** is associated with increased risk and severity of CPP [^116s71yd] [^113g3qb7]. Stress and **psychosocial stressors** exacerbate symptoms and reduce quality of life [^112CHp6U].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured, biopsychosocial approach** is essential [^113ESTm2]:

| **Step** | **Evaluation** |
|-|-|
| History | - Onset <br/> - Character <br/> - Cyclicity <br/> - Sexual/urinary/bowel symptoms <br/> - Menstrual/obstetric history <br/> - Psychosocial factors [^112zgkdE] |
| Examination | - Abdominal/pelvic exam <br/> - Neuromusculoskeletal assessment <br/> - Pelvic floor evaluation [^112zgkdE] |
| Investigations | - Tailored labs (CBC, urinalysis, STI screening) <br/> - Pelvic ultrasound first-line [^114KtnRC] <br/> - MRI or CT if indicated <br/> - Laparoscopy for refractory or unclear cases [^117TEJ8j] |

---

## Management strategies

Management is **multidisciplinary** and individualized:

- **Medical therapy**: NSAIDs, hormonal therapy (OCs, GnRH analogs), neuromodulators (SNRIs, gabapentin) [^111rQN7q].
- **Physical therapy**: Pelvic floor therapy, myofascial release, trigger point injections [^111rQN7q].
- **Psychological therapy**: CBT, mindfulness, trauma-informed care [^111rQN7q].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Exercise, diet, stress management [^111rQN7q].
- **Surgical options**: Reserved for refractory cases or identifiable pathology (e.g. endometriosis excision, hysterectomy) [^117TEJ8j].

---

Chronic pelvic pain in a 30-year-old female is typically **multifactorial**, requiring a **biopsychosocial** evaluation and **multidisciplinary** management to address both physical and psychosocial contributors [^113bC55r].

Chronic pelvic pain is pain lasting longer than 6 months and is estimated to occur in 15% of women. Causes of pelvic pain include disorders of gynecologic, urologic, gastroenterologic, and musculoskeletal systems. The multidisciplinary nature of chronic pelvic pain may complicate diagnosis and treatment. Treatments vary by cause but may include medicinal, neuroablative, and surgical treatments.

### Elucidating the cause of pelvic pain [^1112bm2d]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain is a common condition. Establishing a diagnosis can be complicated by the interplay between various organ systems, including urologic, gynecologic, gastrointestinal, neurologic, endocrinological, psychological, and musculoskeletal. Frequently, the patient will have seen multiple providers and undergone multiple tests, as well as invasive procedures, before the musculoskeletal system is even considered in the differential diagnosis. Typically, the musculoskeletal and nervous systems become suspected culprits only once all other potential etiologies have been eliminated.

Chronic pelvic pain is a common, burdensome, and costly condition that disproportionately affects women. Diagnosis and initial management of chronic pelvic pain in women are within the scope of practice of specialists in obstetrics and gynecology. The challenging complexity of chronic pelvic pain care can be addressed by increased visit time using appropriate coding modifiers, as well as identification of multidisciplinary team members within the practice or by facilitated referral. This Practice Bulletin addresses the diagnosis and management of chronic pelvic pain that is not completely explained by identifiable pathology of the gynecologic, urologic, or gastrointestinal organ systems. When evidence on chronic pelvic pain treatment is limited, recommendations are extrapolated from treatment of other chronic pain conditions to help guide management. The evaluation and management of potential gynecologic etiologies of pelvic pain (ie, endometriosis, adenomyosis, leiomyomas, adnexal pathology, vulvar disorders) are discussed in other publications of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (1–4).

### ACR appropriateness criteriaPostmenopausal subacute or chronic pelvic pain [^114Hfqkc]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Pelvic pain is common in both reproductive age and postmenopausal women, and the major etiologies change throughout the life cycle. Chronic pain is defined as lasting for at least 6 months. There are many gastrointestinal and urinary disorders associated with chronic pain in this age group, which are not discussed in this guideline. Pain may be localized to the deep pelvis, with potential causes including pelvic congestion syndrome, intraperitoneal adhesions, hydrosalpinx, chronic inflammatory disease, or cervical stenosis. Ultrasound is the initial imaging modality of choice, while CT and MRI may be appropriate for further characterization of sonographic findings. Alternatively, pain may be localized to the vagina, vulva, or perineum, with potential causes including vaginal atrophy, vaginismus, vaginal or vulvar cysts, vulvodynia, or pelvic myofascial pain. Imaging is primarily indicated in context of an abnormal physical exam and ultrasound is the initial modality of choice, while MRI may be appropriate for further characterization in select cases. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Factors predisposing women to chronic pelvic pain: systematic review [^116s71yd]. BMJ (2006). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To evaluate factors predisposing women to chronic and recurrent pelvic pain. DESIGN, DATA SOURCES, AND METHODS: Systematic review of relevant studies without language restrictions identified through Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library. SCISEARCH, conference papers, and bibliographies of retrieved primary and review articles. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, quality, and results. Exposure to risk factors was compared between women with and without pelvic pain. Results were pooled within subgroups defined by type of pain and risk factors.

Results

There were 122 studies (in 111 articles) of which 63 (in 64,286 women) evaluated 54 risk factors for dysmenorrhoea, 19 (in 18,601 women) evaluated 14 risk factors for dyspareunia, and 40 (in 12,040 women) evaluated 48 factors for non-cyclical pelvic pain. Age < 30 years, low body mass index, smoking, earlier menarche (< 12 years), longer cycles, heavy menstrual flow, nulliparity, premenstrual syndrome, sterilisation, clinically suspected pelvic inflammatory disease, sexual abuse, and psychological symptoms were associated with dysmenorrhoea. Younger age at first childbirth, exercise, and oral contraceptives were negatively associated with dysmenorrhoea. Menopause, pelvic inflammatory disease, sexual abuse, anxiety, and depression were associated with dyspareunia. Drug or alcohol abuse, miscarriage, heavy menstrual flow, pelvic inflammatory disease, previous caesarean section, pelvic pathology, abuse, and psychological comorbidity were associated with an increased risk of non-cyclical pelvic pain.

Conclusion

Several gynaecological and psychosocial factors are strongly associated with chronic pelvic pain. Randomised controlled trials of interventions targeting these potentially modifiable factors are needed to assess their clinical relevance in chronic pelvic pain.

### Could chronic pelvic pain be a functional somatic syndrome? [^114J7onZ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

The cause of noncyclical chronic pelvic pain (CPP) in many women is unknown: 30% have no identifiable pelvic pathology, and in those who do the relationship of CPP and the pathology is often unclear. Moreover, epidemiologic studies demonstrate that the common findings of endometriosis and adhesions do not greatly increase the odds of having CPP. CPP and the functional somatic syndromes (fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, and others) share many characteristics including pain as a prominent symptom and comorbidity. For the functional somatic syndromes, the initial focus of etiologic investigations has been on local mechanisms and then on systemic pathogeneses. We believe that the research trajectories of the functional somatic syndromes and CPP are converging. Their juncture might reveal an important pathologic mechanism for CPP in some women that is primarily outside the pelvis. This observation would open up new areas of exploration and treatment of CPP.

### Evolutionary considerations in the development of chronic pelvic pain [^1148We4G]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain is common among women of reproductive age and is associated with significant morbidity and comorbidities. In this Viewpoint, we explore the evolutionary cause of pelvic pain and summarize evidence that supports a menstruation-related evolutionary cause of chronic visceral pelvic pain: (1) lifetime menstruation has increased; (2) severe dysmenorrhea is common in the chronic pelvic pain population, particularly among those with pain sensitization; and (3) a potential biological mechanism can be identified. Thus, chronic pelvic pain may arise from the mismatch between the slow pace of biological evolution in our bodies and the relatively rapid pace of cultural changes that have resulted in increased menstrual frequency due to earlier menarche, later mortality, and lower fecundity. One possible mechanism that explains the development of persistent pain from repeated episodes of intermittent pain is hyperalgesic priming, a physiological process defined as a long-lasting latent hyperresponsiveness of nociceptors to inflammatory mediators after an inflammatory or neuropathic insult. The repetitive severely painful menstrual episodes may play such a role. From an evolutionary perspective the relatively rapid increase in lifetime menstruation experience in contemporary society may contribute to a mismatch between lifetime menstruation and the physiological pain processes, leading to a maladaptive state of chronic visceral pelvic pain. Our current physiology does not conform to current human needs.

### Chronic pelvic pain in women: evaluation and treatment [^111cKoov]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain affects up to 26% of individuals with female anatomy and is defined as at least 6 months of pain that is perceived to originate in the pelvis. Chronic pelvic pain is highly correlated with psychosocial comorbidities, including depression, anxiety, and history of abuse. Although common causes include irritable bowel syndrome, bladder pain syndrome (interstitial cystitis), pelvic floor dysfunction, and endometriosis, chronic pelvic pain is most often the result of multiple coexisting pain conditions and central nervous system hypersensitivity. Evaluation requires a biopsychosocial approach, beginning with a complete history and physical examination to ensure an accurate and timely diagnosis. Diagnostic laboratory and imaging tests are of limited utility and should be tailored to investigate presenting symptoms and examination findings. When a single etiology is identified, treatment should follow disease-specific guidelines; otherwise, the management of undifferentiated chronic pelvic pain should follow an interdisciplinary approach to improve function and quality of life. Multimodal treatment includes pain education, self-care, behavioral therapy, physical therapy, and pharmacotherapy, with limited indications for surgical interventions. Regular follow-up to review progress is necessary. Clinicians should have a low threshold for referral to interdisciplinary pain management or other subspecialties when improvement is not seen.

### Musculoskeletal causes of chronic pelvic pain: what a gynecologist should know [^113hgE3h]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Ten percent of all gynecologic consultations are for chronic pelvic pain, and 20% of patients require a laparoscopy. Chronic pelvic pain affects 15% of all women annually in the United States, with medical costs and loss of productivity estimated at $2.8 billion and $15 billion per year, respectively. Chronic pelvic pain in women may have multifactorial etiology, but 22% have pain associated with musculoskeletal causes. Unfortunately, pelvic musculoskeletal dysfunction is not routinely evaluated as a cause of pelvic pain by gynecologists. A pelvic musculoskeletal examination is simple to perform, is not time-consuming, and is one of the most important components to investigate in all chronic pelvic pain patients. This article describes common musculoskeletal causes of chronic pelvic pain and explains how to perform a simple musculoskeletal examination that can be easily incorporated into the gynecologist physical examination.

### Chronic pelvic pain [^1147BJFD]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

As opposed to the satisfying solutions found in the management of acute pain, chronic pelvic pain can be a vexing problem for the patient and physician. Seldom is a single source or cause found, and nearly always the condition is influenced by the broader social and psychological context of the patient. In this article, we discuss the evaluation of chronic pelvic pain, often considering pain as the disease itself, and identify peripheral generators, which gynecologists can address to help reduce their contributions to symptoms.

### Chronic pelvic pain in urogynecological practice: a personal view [^1157mCD5]. International Urogynecology Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Women with chronic pelvic pain are frequently referred to gynaecologists as over 50% also have genitourinary or irritable bowel symptoms or both. When no specific pathology is found and the pathophysiology is unclear, the aetiology is probably an interplay of neuropathic, inflammatory and functional factors. The principles of medical and surgical treatment are discussed and should be based on evidence-based medicine.

### Chronic pelvic pain [^117CcrBM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain is a common and significant disorder of women. It is estimated to have a prevalence of 3.8% in women. Often the etiology of chronic pelvic pain is not clear, as there are many disorders of the reproductive tract, gastrointestinal system, urological organs, musculoskeletal system, and psychoneurological system that may be associated with chronic pelvic pain. The history and physical examination are crucial in evaluating a woman with chronic pelvic pain and must address all of the possible systems potentially involved in chronic pelvic pain, not just the reproductive system. Laboratory and imaging studies should be selectively utilized, as should laparoscopy. Conscious laparoscopic pain mapping has been proposed as a way to improve information derived from laparoscopic evaluations. Treatment of chronic pelvic pain may consist of two approaches. One is to treat chronic pain itself as a diagnosis, and the other is to treat diseases or disorders that might be a cause of or a contributor to chronic pelvic pain. These two approaches are not mutually exclusive, and in many patients effective therapy is best achieved by using both approaches. Treatment of chronic pain as well as treatment of four of the more common disorders associated with chronic pelvic pain (endometriosis, adhesions, irritable bowel syndrome, and interstitial cystitis) are discussed in this review.

### The fundamentals of chronic pelvic pain assessment, based on international continence society recommendations [^113eikYz]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is defined as a noncyclical pain that has duration of at least 6 months and can lead to decreased quality of life and physical performance. The pain can be attributed to problems in the pelvic organs and/or problems in related systems, and possible psycho-social attributes may contribute to the manifestation. Due to the complex nature, CPP syndromes are multifactorial and the terminology needs to reflect the setting.

Methods

The current review is a synthesis of key aspects of the recent International Continence Society Standardization for Terminology in CPP Syndromes.

Results

Nine domains can be used for a detailed description of CPP. They include four domains specific to the pelvic organs (lower urinary tract, female genital, male genital, gastrointestinal), two related to other sources of pain which may be perceived in the pelvis (musculoskeletal, neurological) and three which may influence the response to the pain or its impact on the individual (psychological, sexual, and comorbidities). For an individual patient with CPP, each domain should be reviewed in terms of symptoms and signs, noting that positive findings could reflect either a primary cause or a secondary consequence. The findings will guide further evaluations and subsequent treatment.

Conclusion

We present a synthesis of the standard for terminology in CPP syndromes in women and men, which serves as a systematic framework to consider possible sources of pain (pelvic organs or other sources) and the individual responses and impact.

Chronic pelvic pain is a complex diagnosis that has a significant impact on quality of life and function in women of all ages. Symptoms often span across numerous organ systems and involve several types of pain including visceral, neuropathic, musculoskeletal, and psychological, making management and treatment difficult. To adequately assess and recognize etiologies of pelvic pain, it is critical to first understand the specialized skills required for history taking and physical examination. This article aims to serve as a guide to understanding the physiatrist's approach to history taking and examination of pelvic pain.

### Diagnosis and management of chronic pelvic pain [^116TT42r]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain is difficult to diagnose and to treat [81] because of the multiple and often overlapping causes [82]. A systematic approach aids in the thorough evaluation and appropriate therapy. At the initial visit(s), a thorough history should be taken and complete physical examination performed. Screening for co-existing conditions, such as depression, narcotic dependency, and physical, sexual, or emotional abuse is crucial so these issues may be addressed immediately while additional causes for pelvic pain are evaluated. The relative likelihood of gastrointestinal, urologic, musculoskeletal, or gynecologic etiology must be considered to guide a more thorough initial evaluation. With gynecologic chronic pelvic pain, differentiation between hormonally responsive and nonresponsive conditions is helpful for diagnosis and treatment. Therapy can then be instituted or an appropriate referral made.

2 THE INVISIBLE EPIDEMIC

Chronic pelvic pain affects an estimated one in four women worldwide. Despite this high prevalence, the global burden of CPP remains understudied. A 2006 WHO systematic review found that only 14% of low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) and 51% of high‐income countries (HICs) had studies examining the prevalence of CPP. Alarmingly, this data gap persisted largely unchanged in 2014. Although gynecological diseases in women aged 25–49 years ranked seventh in the 2019 global burden of disease, this likely continues to underestimate the true impact of CPP, and we question whether this figure would be much higher if all women with CPP were included.,

CPP remains largely invisible in global health discussions, under‐recognized, under‐researched, and under‐funded compared to other conditions with a similar prevalence, such as asthma, migraines, or chronic low back pain. This disparity highlights the urgent need to prioritize CPP. The burden substantially impacts well‐being, quality of life, productivity, and healthcare systems. Although disproportionately affecting women in LMICs, exacerbating health disparities, CPP is also under‐addressed in HICs. This "invisible epidemic" is perpetuated by the following:
Societal stigma: shame surrounding reproductive health and normalization of pelvic pain, which prevents help‐seeking.
Healthcare provider gaps: inadequate training leads to delayed diagnosis and inadequate treatment.
Limited research: insufficient funding hinders understanding, diagnosis, and treatment development.

The fact that CPP primarily affects women contributes to its neglect. This gendered disparity is amplified in LMICs, but even in HICs, women face discrimination, delayed diagnosis, and limited access to specialized care. Studies show that only 40% of women with CPP seek medical help, and among those who do, many are never referred to a specialist, and nearly 50% do not receive pain therapy. Gendered differences in pain care are well‐documented, with women less likely to receive pain medication. These disparities are compounded for racial and ethnic minorities, creating a cycle of underdiagnosis, inadequate treatment, and suffering, further magnified by socioeconomic factors.

Achieving the goals outlined in this consensus statement will require a concerted and collaborative effort from all stakeholders, including scientific societies, healthcare providers, researchers, policymakers, patient advocates, and women with CPP themselves. We believe that a multi‐pronged approach, encompassing individual empowerment, healthcare system reform, and global policy commitments, is essential for driving meaningful change. Through collaborative action and a shared dedication to improving women's health, we can reduce the global burden of CPP and enhance the well‐being of millions of women worldwide (Table 1).

6 GAPS IN HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION

Many providers lack a comprehensive understanding of the complex nature of pelvic pain, including its diverse etiologies, overlapping symptoms, and the importance of a biopsychosocial approach to care. This educational gap often leads to misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis, and inappropriate or ineffective treatment. Women's pain is frequently dismissed or minimized, often by frustrated providers, resulting in patient frustration and a sense of being unheard, further compounding their suffering. Inadequate education may also result in inequitable care, fragmented approaches, and, ultimately, poor patient outcomes. Fortunately, deficiencies in training can be addressed by improving training resources and investing in robust, standardized education for healthcare professionals across multiple disciplines, including primary care physicians, gynecologists, urologists, gastroenterologists, physical therapists, and mental health professionals.

### Multifactorial contributors to the severity of chronic pelvic pain in women [^113g3qb7]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pelvic pain affects ∼15% of women, and is associated with significant societal cost and impact on women's health. Identifying factors involved in chronic pelvic pain is challenging due to its multifactorial nature and confounding between potential factors. For example, while some women with endometriosis have chronic pelvic pain, there may be comorbid conditions that are implicated in the chronic pelvic pain rather than the endometriosis itself.

Objective

We sought to explore multifactorial variables independently associated with the severity of chronic pelvic pain in women.

Study Design

We used baseline cross-sectional data from an ongoing prospective cohort, collected from patient online questionnaires, physical examination, and physician review of medical records. Participants were recruited from a tertiary referral center for endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, from December 2013 through April 2015. Exclusion criteria included menopausal status or age > 50 years. Primary outcome was self-reported severity of chronic pelvic pain in the last 3 months (0–10 numeric rating scale). Potential associated factors ranged from known pain conditions assessed by standard diagnostic criteria, validated psychological questionnaires, musculoskeletal physical exam findings, as well as pain-related, reproductive, medical/surgical, familial, demographic, and behavioral characteristics. Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, or Spearman test were used to identify variables with an association with the primary outcome (P < .05), followed by multivariable linear regression to control for confounding and to identify independent associations with the primary outcome (P < .05).

Results

Overall, 656 women were included (87% consent rate), of whom 55% were diagnosed with endometriosis. The following factors were independently associated with higher severity of chronic pelvic pain: abdominal wall pain (P = 0.005), pelvic floor tenderness (P = 0.004), painful bladder syndrome (P = 0.019), higher score on Pain Catastrophizing Scale (P < .001), adult sexual assault (P = 0.043), higher body mass index (P = 0.023), current smoking (P = 0.049), and family history of chronic pain (P = 0.038). Severity of chronic pelvic pain was similar between women with and without endometriosis.

Conclusion

Multifactorial variables independently associated with severity of chronic pelvic pain were identified, ranging from myofascial/musculoskeletal, urological, family history, and psycho-social factors. Continued research is required to validate these factors and to determine whether any are potentially modifiable for the management of chronic pelvic pain.

### Pelvic pain: an overview [^111quU67]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Although the cause of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is multifactorial, a substantial number of cases have musculoskeletal and neuromuscular causes. Multiple stakeholders, including physicians with varying degrees of pain training ranging from primary care physicians, obstetricians, gynecologists, urologists, neurologists, gastroenterologists, psychologists, physical therapists, and physiatrists, are involved in the care of these patients. Physiatrists play a pivotal role in the treatment of patients with CPP because their training focuses on improving quality of life through a holistic approach to patient management and on the musculoskeletal and neuromuscular systems.

1 THE MULTIFACED PROBLEM OF CHRONIC PELVIC PAIN BEGINS WITH THE DEFINITION

Despite widespread recognition of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) as a significant clinical problem, inconsistencies in its definition across leading organizations — including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), WHO, and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (RCOG) — create substantial challenges for clinical practice, research, and education. ACOG defines CPP based on anatomical origin (pelvic organs/structures) and duration (greater than 6 months), highlighting associated negative consequences and related symptoms. Conversely, IASP prioritizes the patient's pain experience, defining CPP with a shorter duration (3 months) and emphasizing specific pain syndromes.WHO's ICD‐11 classification distinguishes between chronic primary pain (the condition itself) and chronic secondary pain (a symptom of an underlying condition). The RCOG definition further complicates matters by characterizing CPP primarily as a symptom.

These disparate approaches — with ACOG's broad definition contrasting with IASP and WHO's subtype categorizations, and the RCOG's focus on CPP as a symptom — hinder comparisons of research findings, the development of standardized treatment protocols, and accurate assessments of CPP's prevalence and burden. This inconsistent overlap across definitions also complicates the training of healthcare professionals. Moreover, the frequent co‐occurrence of CPP with other conditions complicates diagnosis and often delays appropriate treatment. This heterogeneity is also reflected in the breadth and variation in the definitions for CPP. This diagnostic ambiguity creates significant challenges for researchers seeking to establish relevant outcome measures, determine accurate prevalence rates, and develop effective treatment strategies. Ultimately, the multifactorial nature of CPP, exacerbated by these definitional inconsistencies, negatively impacts the well‐being of affected individuals and impedes progress in understanding and managing this complex condition.

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is multifactorial in etiology and heterogeneous in presentation. Identification of all pain contributors is essential for successful management. Chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs) are a specified group of chronic pain conditions that commonly co-occur in patients. We briefly review individual COPCs and highlight risk factors and mechanisms that appear to be applicable across COPCs. We review evaluation and communication strategies that may help establish a productive therapeutic relationship between clinicians and patients. Management should include treatment of peripheral pain generators as well as co-occurring psychological conditions and central sensitization when present.

### Chronic pelvic pain in women: a review [^113bC55r]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a challenging condition that affects an estimated 26% of the world's female population. Chronic pelvic pain accounts for 40% of laparoscopies and 12% of hysterectomies in the US annually even though the origin of CPP is not gynecologic in 80% of patients. Both patients and clinicians are often frustrated by a perceived lack of treatments. This review summarizes the evaluation and management of CPP using recommendations from consensus guidelines to facilitate clinical evaluation, treatment, improved care, and more positive patient-clinician interactions.

Observations

Chronic pelvic pain conditions often overlap with nonpelvic pain disorders (eg, fibromyalgia, migraines) and nonpain comorbidities (eg, sleep, mood, cognitive impairment) to contribute to pain severity and disability. Musculoskeletal pain and dysfunction are found in 50% to 90% of patients with CPP. Traumatic experiences and distress have important roles in pain modulation. Complete assessment of the biopsychosocial factors that contribute to CPP requires obtaining a thorough history, educating the patient about pain mechanisms, and extending visit times. Training in trauma-informed care and pelvic musculoskeletal examination are essential to reduce patient anxiety associated with the examination and to avoid missing the origin of myofascial pain. Recommended treatments are usually multimodal and require an interdisciplinary team of clinicians. A single-organ pathological examination should be avoided. Patient involvement, shared decision-making, functional goal setting, and a discussion of expectations for long-term care are important parts of the evaluation process.

Conclusions and Relevance

Chronic pelvic pain is like other chronic pain syndromes in that biopsychosocial factors interact to contribute and influence pain. To manage this type of pain, clinicians must consider centrally mediated pain factors as well as pelvic and nonpelvic visceral and somatic structures that can generate or contribute to pain.

### Chronic pelvic pain in an interdisciplinary setting: 1-year prospective cohort [^112vYgPp]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pelvic pain affects ∼15% of women, and presents a challenging problem for gynecologists due to its complex etiology involving multiple comorbidities. Thus, an interdisciplinary approach has been proposed for chronic pelvic pain, where these multifactorial comorbidities can be addressed by different interventions at a single integrated center. Moreover, while cross-sectional studies can provide some insight into the association between these comorbidities and chronic pelvic pain severity, prospective longitudinal cohorts can identify comorbidities associated with changes in chronic pelvic pain severity over time.

Objective

We sought to describe trends and factors associated with chronic pelvic pain severity over a 1-year prospective cohort at an interdisciplinary center, with a focus on the role of comorbidities and controlling for baseline pain, demographic factors, and treatment effects.

Study Design

This was a prospective 1-year cohort study at an interdisciplinary tertiary referral center for pelvic pain and endometriosis, which provides minimally invasive surgery, medical management, pain education, physiotherapy, and psychological therapies. Exclusion criteria included menopause or age > 50 years. Sample size was 296 (57% response rate at 1 year; 296/525). Primary outcome was chronic pelvic pain severity at 1 year on an 11-point numeric rating scale (0–10), which was categorized for ordinal regression (none-mild 0–3, moderate 4–6, severe 7–10). Secondary outcomes included functional quality of life and health utilization. Baseline comorbidities were endometriosis, irritable bowel syndrome, painful bladder syndrome, abdominal wall pain, pelvic floor myalgia, and validated questionnaires for depression, anxiety, and catastrophizing. Multivariable ordinal regression was used to identify baseline comorbidities associated with the primary outcome at 1 year.

Results

Chronic pelvic pain severity decreased by a median 2 points from baseline to 1 year (6/10–4/10, P < .001). There was also an improvement in functional quality of life (42–29% on the pain subscale of the Endometriosis Health Profile-30, P < .001), and a reduction in subjects requiring a physician visit (73–36%, P < .001) or emergency visit (24–11%, P < .001) in the last 3 months. On multivariable ordinal regression for the primary outcome, chronic pelvic pain severity at 1 year was independently associated with a higher score on the Pain Catastrophizing Scale at baseline (odds ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–1.21, P = 0.04), controlling for baseline pain, treatment effects (surgery), age, and referral status.

Conclusion

Improvements in chronic pelvic pain severity, quality of life, and health care utilization were observed in a 1-year cohort in an interdisciplinary setting. Higher pain catastrophizing at baseline was associated with greater chronic pelvic pain severity at 1 year. Consideration should be given to stratifying pelvic pain patients by catastrophizing level (rumination, magnification, helplessness) in research studies and in clinical practice.

Evaluation for nongynecologic etiologies — chronic pelvic pain: Symptom questionnaires can assist screening for depression, interstitial cystitis, and irritable bowel syndrome, and patients with unexplained urinary symptoms or bladder pain, irritable bowel syndrome symptoms and risk factors, or complex mood symptoms may benefit from appropriate referrals, including to a mental health professional. Laboratory and imaging tests are limited in utility and should be tailored; patients with sexually transmitted infection risk factors should be tested for gonorrheal, chlamydial, mycoplasmal, and trichomonad infections, those with uterine or adnexal tenderness or suspected pelvic mass should undergo transvaginal ultrasonography and possibly diagnostic laparoscopy, and suspected chronic pelvic inflammatory disease can be evaluated with endometrial biopsy and transvaginal ultrasonography. Evaluation for common nonreproductive contributors should include screening for interstitial cystitis or painful bladder syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulitis, and comorbid mood disorders, with additional testing or referral as needed to rule out other causes of urinary, gastrointestinal, or constitutional symptoms in at-risk patients.

4 CHALLENGES IN ESTABLISHING‐FOCUSED HEALTH POLICIES

Despite the significant global health, economic, and social impact, CPP suffers from a critical lack of recognition within health policy agendas and research funding priorities. This underinvestment hinders progress, perpetuating a cycle of under‐recognition, underfunding, and limited access, resulting in unnecessary suffering and substantial economic burdens. The consequences are far‐reaching, resulting in unnecessary suffering for millions of women, substantial monetary burdens on individuals, families, and healthcare systems, and a significant impediment to women's overall well‐being and societal participation. This neglect not only reflects a general dismissal of women's health concerns but also highlights societies and policymakers' lack of awareness of the far‐reaching impacts of overlooking CPP.

To ensure that women with CPP receive the necessary care, the cycle of neglect must be broken by explicitly incorporating CPP into both local and global health agendas. This necessitates a commitment to increase and sustain investment in research and improve resource allocation. Data collection and integration into national strategies are essential to this endeavor. Analysis of the prevalence, burden, and economic impact of CPP will inform policy decisions and resource allocation. Therefore, CPP‐specific metrics must be developed for tracking progress in research funding and policy implementation.

Introduction

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a debilitating condition, affecting 15% of women worldwide. It is associated with significant socio-economic burden and long-term morbidity. CPP is defined as pain lasting > 6 months or recurrent episodes of abdominal/pelvic pain, hypersensitivity or discomfort often accompanied by elimination changes and sexual dysfunction. CPP remains a challenging disorder to treat because of the complexities of pain sensation and unclear aetiology. Standard medical and surgical treatments seldom prove effective at improving quality of life and pain intensity among affected women. Furthermore, the variation in outcome reporting of trials evaluating interventions has prevented the synthesis of data to identify effective treatments and draw clinically relevant conclusions in the context of guideline formation.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPG) are systematically developed statements using best available research evidence. They aim to improve the delivery and quality of patient care and health outcomes. Adoption of CPG attempts to eliminate variation, standardize medical care and implement effective treatments. Guidelines are developed using standardized methods and processes including: engaging stakeholder groups, identifying, quality assessment and synthesis of research evidence as well using consensus methods to derive robust guideline recommendations. The methodological quality of guidelines has been inconsistent.

Guidelines based on poor evidence or those that fail to reflect the needs of women may contribute to the delivery of suboptimal, ineffective or even harmful interventions thereby compromising the quality of care. To date, there has been no evaluation of the methodological quality of national or international guidelines on female CPP. In this systematic review, we aimed to evaluate the methodological quality of CPP guidelines, produce a comprehensive inventory of recommendations and explore the relationships between recommendations and evidence.

8 A CALL TO ACTION ON CHRONIC PELVIC PAIN

CPP inflicts significant suffering and economic burden upon millions of women worldwide, yet it remains a neglected area of health research and policy. This disparity between impact and resource allocation is unacceptable. This consensus statement calls for urgent action to prioritize CPP by promoting the following key actions:
Establishing a consensus definition of chronic pelvic pain: the first step must be to obtain a consensus on the definition of CPP, agreed upon by multiple societies and advocacy groups. A clear definition paves the way for the development of a classification system, akin to PALM‐COEINfor abnormal uterine bleeding, which will enable clinicians to accurately diagnose CPP and enhance trainee and health professional education. An established definition will also assist researchers to precisely identify study populations, promote standardized data collection, and aid with the interpretation of results across studies, including systematic reviews and meta‐analyses. A clear definition empowers patients by giving them a name for their condition, validating their experience, and facilitating communication with healthcare professionals. Finally, a consensus definition provides policymakers with a focus for understanding the scope of the problem and allocating resources appropriately.
Empower women and reduce stigma: women with CPP play a vital role in changing the landscape of care for this condition. Their lived experiences are invaluable in identifying gaps in care, developing more effective and compassionate treatment approaches, and driving improvements in access to care. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and International Pelvic Pain Society (IPPS) call on affiliated societies to partner with women with CPP and patient advocacy groups to develop and implement strategies that not only remove stigma and create a supportive environment where women feel empowered to seek help, but also actively engage them in promoting education and advancing research on this condition. Their participation in studies, sharing of experiences, and input on research priorities are vital for enhancing our understanding of CPP mechanisms, developing innovative diagnostic tools, discovering more effective treatments, and developing policies that improve care. This type of collaboration with patients can be fostered through research, awareness campaigns, educational initiatives, and open dialogue.
Expand access to quality transdisciplinary care: increasing access to transdisciplinary care for women with CPP requires a multifaceted approach. First, improving physician education is essential, ensuring that healthcare professionals across various specialties (e.g. gynecology, primary care, physical therapy, mental health) are well‐versed in the complexities of CPP and the benefits of collaborative care. Simultaneously, developing practical tools and resources, such as standardized assessment protocols, referral pathways, and patient education materials, can facilitate coordinated care delivery. Disseminating evidence‐based clinical guidelines will ensure consistent, high‐quality care across different healthcare settings. Integrating CPP care into primary care settings will enable early diagnosis, timely referral to specialized services, and improved care coordination. Importantly, these resources must be adaptable to countries with varied cultures and socioeconomic means. It is imperative that healthcare professionals and models of care shift away from treating CPP as an acute condition to a chronic care model that prioritizes long‐term management, physical and emotional rehabilitation, and mental well‐being. Policies should encourage the establishment of transdisciplinary pain clinics or networks, where specialists can work together, to provide comprehensive and integrated care. Finally, an evidence‐based biopsychosocial and trauma‐informed approach must be incorporated into all aspects of evaluation and management. This approach recognizes that women with CPP come from diverse backgrounds and varying socioeconomic statuses, and may have experienced traumatic events such as war, poverty, or abuse, all of which can significantly influence their pain experience and response to treatment. By acknowledging these factors and shifting the focus from "curing" an acute problem to managing a long‐term health condition, healthcare providers can promote well‐being and create a safe and supportive environment, foster trust, and facilitate more effective, patient‐centered care.
Enhance education and awareness: CPP is often misunderstood, with many women suffering in silence. To address this, public awareness campaigns are needed to educate women, their families, and communities about CPP symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options. These campaigns must challenge the harmful notion that pelvic pain is an acceptable or normal part of being a woman. By reducing stigma and encouraging help‐seeking behavior, we can empower women to take control of their health and seek timely care. Simultaneously, healthcare providers need comprehensive education and training to effectively diagnose and manage CPP. This includes promoting a transdisciplinary approach, utilizing the biopsychosocial model, and ensuring cultural sensitivity in all patient interactions. Providing women with culturally relevant educational resources will further empower them to actively participate in their care and navigate the healthcare system with confidence.
Prioritizing research and funding: there are multifactorial causes for CPP and all of them are under‐studied. FIGO and IPPS emphasize the urgent need to recognize the underestimated impact of CPP. This underestimation leads to inadequate funding, limited recognition within healthcare systems, and ultimately, suboptimal care for millions of women. To address this, a rigorous assessment of CPP's full economic burden, including the often‐overlooked costs of unpaid work and lost productivity, is crucial. This comprehensive understanding will inform resource allocation and prioritize effective interventions. Furthermore, research efforts must explore the knowledge gaps, stigma, and barriers to care that perpetuate the cycle of neglect. Increased investment in transdisciplinary CPP research is essential. This research should prioritize innovative diagnostic tools, non‐surgical interventions that are more easily accessible, tailoring treatments to individual needs, and therapies that improve all aspects of physical, mental, and emotional health. Including CPP in global health agendas and research funding priorities is not only a matter of justice for women but is also essential for the well‐being and economic prosperity of societies worldwide.
Developing dedicated CPP sections within healthcare societies: all relevant healthcare societies, including those representing gynecology, urology, gastroenterology, primary care, pain management, physical therapy, and behavioral and mental health, are strongly encouraged to develop dedicated sections, committees, or working groups specifically focused on CPP.
FIGO and IPPS are committed to universal gynecologic health coverage and work as hard on creating preventive care strategies as they do on access to the best medical, surgical, and emergency gynecologic care.

### A meta-synthesis of qualitative literature on female chronic pelvic pain for the development of a core outcome set: a systematic review [^116WFJDH]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a debilitating condition in severe cases and affects 15% of women worldwide. It is associated with significant long-term morbidity, increased healthcare utilization and socio-economic burden. It is defined as pain lasting > 6 months or recurrent episodes of abdominal/pelvic pain, hypersensitivity or discomfort often accompanied with elimination changes and sexual dysfunction.

Qualitative research is underused despite its potential to inform and improve the quality of care of women with CPP. Current standard medical and surgical interventions lack a holistic approach thereby failing to improve pain intensity and quality of life outcomes. The evidence to support such treatments is extrapolated from quantitative research. However, the complexities of pain sensation require research beyond the benefits and harms of an intervention as demonstrated by clinical trials.

There is increasing use and emphasis of qualitative evidence synthesis (QES) within clinical, public health, policy and healthcare systems. A criticism of primary qualitative studies is the lack of generalisability of findings beyond the population studied. However, a QES is the combination and analysis of individual qualitative studies, bringing together multiple perspectives, which may not be represented by a single study. QES seek to develop an understanding of health related behaviours, experiences of illness, evaluation and implementation of complex interventions. Researchers are able to gain a greater understanding of individual's experiences, views, beliefs and priorities for healthcare.

Transparent reporting of QES has emerged as an important area of consideration. Standardized reporting is necessary to facilitate the appropriate use of qualitative evidence into policy and practice. A modified GRADE approach, CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) provides a systematic and transparent framework assessing how much confidence to place in findings from QES. It consists of four components including: (1) the methodological limitations of the individual qualitative studies contributing to a review finding, (2) the coherence of the review finding, (3) the adequacy of data supporting a review finding and (4) the relevance to the review question of the individual studies contributing to a review finding.

To date, there is no previous QES exploring the experience of women with CPP that has applied a CERQual approach. Earlier QES have been limited, often descriptive and lacking in standardized quality assessment of recommendations. In this study, we aimed to perform a QES describing the views and perspectives of women with CPP. We analysed findings using a CERQual approach with a focus on insights that may be useful in the process of establishing core outcome sets (COS) in CPP.

### Chronic pelvic pain: ACOG practice bulletin, number 218 [^112zgkdE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain initial evaluation — A detailed medical history and physical examination, with particular attention to the abdominal and pelvic neuromusculoskeletal examination, are recommended; physical findings that increase the likelihood of neuromusculoskeletal contributors include pelvic floor muscle tenderness and abdominal wall tenderness that reproduce the patient's pain. The most critical portions are a detailed medical, surgical, and gynecologic history and a thorough physical examination, and self-administered screening forms completed before the visit can optimize care; a systematic history should include a detailed chronology of symptoms, a review of previous treatments, and information on pain aggravators and alleviators related to sexual activity, menstruation, physical activity, and urinary and gastrointestinal function. The medical history should include specific chronology, triggers, and treatments of pain; a review of all medical diagnoses, surgical procedures and findings, obstetric details, medications, and allergies; and psychosocial factors, with the success or failure of previous treatment attempts noted. Focusing the physical examination on the abdominal and pelvic neuromusculoskeletal system with inclusion of a visceral examination is stated to address most etiologies and is highly likely to yield an accurate diagnosis; evaluation should include palpation of the lower back, sacroiliac joints, pubic symphysis, as well as the abdomen and genitalia.

### Chronic pelvic pain: ACOG practice bulletin, number 218 [^115nQ1PP]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain — differential diagnosis and interdisciplinary model: The differential diagnosis for chronic pelvic pain is extensive, and organizing the possibilities into visceral and neuromusculoskeletal disorders and psychosocial contributors can facilitate evaluation and treatment while maintaining awareness of the likely multifactorial etiology. The multifactorial nature of chronic pelvic pain lends itself to an interdisciplinary model of care that seeks to identify and treat an individual's physical pain generators as well as comorbid conditions, such as depression and anxiety, which together create the symptomatology and contribute to the overall burden of disease. For example, a chronic pelvic pain patient's pain may not improve until her endometriosis is treated, reactive pelvic floor myalgia is addressed, central sensitization is controlled with neuromodulator treatment, and depression is in remission.

Chronic pelvic pain — ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 218 summary of recommendations: The routine use of laparoscopic adhesiolysis is not recommended for the management of chronic pelvic pain (Level A). For Level B, referral for pelvic floor physical therapy, sex therapy, or cognitive behavioral therapy, alone or in combination, is recommended to manage the myofascial and psychosocial causes and consequences of chronic pelvic pain and associated dyspareunia; based upon their effectiveness for other neuropathic pain syndromes, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are recommended for patients with neuropathic chronic pelvic pain; based upon their effectiveness for other neuropathic pain syndromes, gabapentin and pregabalin are recommended for the treatment of neuropathic chronic pelvic pain; opioids are not recommended for the treatment of chronic pelvic pain and patients already on opioids should be slowly weaned; and trigger point injections of saline, anesthetic, steroids, or opioids, in isolation or in combination with other treatment modalities, are recommended to improve pain and functional ability in patients with myofascial chronic pelvic pain. For Level C, a detailed medical history and physical examination, with particular attention to the abdominal and pelvic neuromusculoskeletal examination, are recommended for the evaluation of chronic pelvic pain; evaluation for common nonreproductive conditions that contribute to chronic pelvic pain should include screening for interstitial cystitis or painful bladder syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulitis, and comorbid mood disorders (depression, anxiety), with additional testing or referral as needed to rule out other causes of urinary, gastrointestinal, or constitutional symptoms in patients with risk factors; referral to pain medicine specialists may be part of the multidisciplinary care of women with chronic pelvic pain, and the timing of consultation or referral to multidisciplinary care should be individualized; and based on evidence of benefit for the treatment of nongynecologic chronic pain, acupuncture and yoga can be considered for the management of chronic pelvic pain of musculoskeletal etiology.

### Differential diagnosis of chronic pelvic pain in women: the urologist's approach [^116iLtBW]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2009). Medium credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain in women can be caused by a host of gynecological, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, neurologic, as well as urologic disorders. An initial broad differential diagnosis is essential. At times, overlapping symptoms and vague physical findings necessitate a multidisciplinary diagnostic approach. A thorough history, which is careful to characterize all aspects of the patient's symptoms, can usually direct the differential toward the bladder when this organ is the source of the pain. Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) should be included in the differential diagnosis, but it should not be used as an expeditious diagnosis when pain coexists with frequency and urgency. Multiple other urologic conditions such as overactive bladder, urinary tract infection, urethral diverticulum, periurethral masses (Skene gland cyst or abscess), and even urethral stricture disease, have overlapping symptom complexes with IC/PBS, and they must not be overlooked as they are much more easily diagnosed and treated. By using a stepwise approach and an evidence-based thought process, the obscurity of chronic bladder and urethral pain can evolve into a progressively narrowing differential.

### Evaluation of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) on the management of female chronic pelvic pain (CPP) using the AGREE II instrument [^116vpxPY]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic and therapeutic guideline recommendations are helpful in standardizing and improving the quality of care. However, they are limited and may not be relevant or apply in every clinical field of practice. CPP is a manifestation resulting from various underlying conditions that may evolve and develop into regional pain disorders. The complex aetiology of CPP and scarcity of available evidence may cause clinicians to resort to their own experience or seek expert opinions. A holistic approach is needed as underlying causes, treatment options and concerns of women with CPP can vary. Additionally, groups/societies publish guidelines for their members rather than a broader audience. The focus and scope of guidelines may be influenced by the clinical/scientific theme, interests or priorities of publishing societies/professional groups. For example, professional bodies for gynaecologists may focus on endometriosis only in women presenting with CPP. This may have contributed to the variability of recommendations for the management of female CPP observed in this study. The inclusion of a multidisciplinary stakeholder committee will help produce concise and collaborative recommendations that prevent duplicate investigations and the recommendation of ineffective treatments. This study indicated that guidelines performed poorly in the Stakeholder Involvement domain reflecting unilateralism in their approach to CPP including a lack of engagement and participation with their target audience, i.e. women with CPP.

In this review, all guidelines recommended surgical intervention; however, there was no consensus among guidelines. The lack of consistent recommendations presents difficulty when supporting or refuting the effectiveness of surgical procedures, such as adhesiolysis, to manage female CPP. The benefit of bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy during hysterectomy was also unclear with contradictory advice given in two guidelines. There is a place for hysterectomy in the management of CPP particularly due to endometriosis; however, patient selection is paramount. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that bilateral removal of normal ovaries during hysterectomy does not result in improved outcomes but in fact is associated with increased morbidity. Guidelines should not only focus on identifying effective interventions by utilizing the best available evidence but also provide guidance on which patient factors may contribute to the success and failure of such interventions.

### Interventional radiology in woman's health: room for improvement [^1176T6Tu]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). Medium credibility.

It is with great pleasure for us to present to you this exciting edition of CVIR Endovascular with a focus on women's health.

The two-tier system of healthcare for males vs females, resulting in health inequities affecting individual health seeking behaviour, poorer outcomes and delayed diagnosis, has long been recognised. This is a complex topic and the root cause of it is multifaceted, however in the 1960's following the thalidomide scandal, there was a ban on pregnant women as well as women of child bearing age to partake in any trials. Although this was aimed to protect women, what it did end up doing was to side line half the population from important clinical trials which has led to poor recognition of disease patterns and worse outcomes for the female population.

Caroline Criado Perez, in her book, 'Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men', has gathered various statistics that show how women are treated unevenly. She has argued that the data shows that healthcare is "systematically discriminating against women, leaving them chronically misunderstood, mistreated and misdiagnosed".

Gender bias and discrimination occurs at many levels throughout the healthcare system, from the interactions between patients and doctors to the medical research and policies that govern it. In 2018 a study on patients with chronic pain concluded that doctors often view men with chronic pain as "brave" or "stoic", but women as "emotional" or "hysterical". The study also found that women's pain was more likely to be treated as a symptom of a mental health condition, rather than a symptom of a physical condition.

Less is also known about conditions that only affect women, including common gynaecological conditions that can have severe impacts on health and wellbeing. As an example, we now know that pelvic pain is poorly understood and women with pelvic pain have been under-diagnosed and at times dismissed for decades. Endometriosis was once considered a condition that occurs in women in their mid-30's but we now see the disease pattern emerging in younger age groups due to the increased utilisation of imaging.

### Evaluation of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) on the management of female chronic pelvic pain (CPP) using the AGREE II instrument [^113vw4dg]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction and hypothesis

Variations in guidelines may result in differences in treatments and potentially poorer health-related outcomes. We aimed to systematically review and evaluate the quality of national and international guidelines and create an inventory of CPG recommendations on CPP.

Methods

We searched EMBASE and MEDLINE databases from inception till August 2020 as well as websites of professional organizations and societies. We selected national and international CPGs reporting on the diagnosis and management of female CPP. We included six CPGs. Five researchers independently assessed the quality of included guidelines using the AGREE II tool and extracted recommendations.

Results

Two hundred thirty-two recommendations were recorded and grouped into six categories: diagnosis, medical treatment, surgical management, behavioural interventions, complementary/alternative therapies and education/research. Thirty-nine (17.11%) recommendations were comparable including: a comprehensive pain history, a multi-disciplinary approach, attributing muscular dysfunction as a cause of CPP and an assessment of quality of life. Two guidelines acknowledged sexual dysfunction associated with CPP and recommended treatment with pelvic floor exercises and behavioural interventions. All guidelines recommended surgical management; however, there was no consensus regarding adhesiolysis, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy during hysterectomy, neurectomy and laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation. Half of recommendations (106, 46.49%) were unreferenced or made in absence of good-quality evidence or supported by expert opinion. Based on the AGREE II assessment, two guidelines were graded as high quality and recommended without modifications (EAU and RCOG). Guidelines performed poorly in the "Applicability", "Editorial Independence" and "Stakeholder Involvement" domains.

Conclusion

Majority of guidelines were of moderate quality with significant variation in recommendations and quality of guideline development.

### Chronic pelvic pain in women: ACOG updates… [^111mrqY9]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Chronic pelvic pain is most often associated with endometriosis, bladder pain syndrome, or both but also shares the multifactorial aspects of other chronic pain syndromes.
- Neuromuscular pain conditions are common in chronic pelvic pain and can be diagnosed with palpation for pelvic floor muscle tenderness and with the FABER and Carnett tests for sources outside the pelvic floor.
- Pelvic floor physical therapy and trigger point injections can both improve vaginal pain and dyspareunia from neuromuscular chronic pelvic pain.
- Surgical interventions appear to offer no benefit in chronic pelvic pain. From the AFP Editors Chronic pelvic pain is associated with cognitive, behavioral, sexual, and emotional consequences. It is most often defined as noncyclic pain that lasts more than six months, and up to 26% of women meet these criteria. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has new recommendations for managing this condition.

Common Associated Conditions The most common associated conditions are endometriosis and bladder pain syndrome, which affect between 60% and 70% of patients with chronic pelvic pain. Nearly one-half of patients with chronic pelvic pain have both conditions. Other common conditions that affect at least one in five patients with chronic pelvic pain are irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, pelvic floor muscle tenderness, and depression. Evaluation Because chronic pelvic pain is often multifactorial, most patients will have multiple pain generators and comorbid conditions. Although many conditions are associated with chronic pelvic pain, determining how pain changes with sexual activity, menstruation, urination, and defecation is a good starting point. Patients often focus on visceral etiologies, yet neuromuscular issues such as myofascial trigger points may be more common and are often overlooked.

In addition to neuromuscular and gynecologic conditions, many patients with chronic pelvic pain also have comorbid mood disorders, gastrointestinal conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome or diverticulitis, and urinary conditions such as interstitial cystitis. Laboratory and imaging tests for chronic pelvic pain are useful only if suggested by the presentation. Multidisciplinary Care Multidisciplinary care is essential for chronic pelvic pain because the central nervous system sensitization of the chronic pain process makes it unlikely that pain will resolve through a single intervention. In addition to treating identified physical pain generators, treating psychological comorbidities is an essential element of care.

### Do short-term markers of treatment efficacy predict long-term sequelae of pelvic inflammatory disease? [^114n3fop]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to assess whether short-term markers, often used to measure clinical cure after treatment for pelvic inflammatory disease, predict sequelae of lack of pregnancy, recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease, and chronic pelvic pain.

Study Design

Women with mild-to-moderate pelvic inflammatory disease were assessed after treatment initiation at 5 days for tenderness (n = 713) and at 30 days for tenderness, cervical infections and endometritis (n = 298). Pregnancy, recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease, and chronic pelvic pain were evaluated after 84 months, on average.

Results

Pelvic tenderness at 5 and at 30 days significantly elevated the risk for developing chronic pelvic pain; tenderness at 30 days was also significantly associated with recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease. However, pelvic tenderness at 5 and at 30 days was only modestly clinically predictive of chronic pelvic pain or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (positive predictive values 22.1–66.9%). No short-term marker significantly influenced the likelihood of achieving a pregnancy.

Conclusion

Tenderness at 5 or 30 days did not accurately predict the occurrence of pelvic inflammatory disease-related reproductive morbidities.

Gynecologic and urologic etiologies are the sources of pelvic pain for many individuals. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the various genitourinary sources of pelvic pain. It is important to recognize that although these disorders predominantly affect women, there are various conditions that affect both men and women, and these should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with pelvic pain. Providers who encounter patients with pelvic pain should attempt to localize these symptoms and obtain a comprehensive history from the patient to help direct diagnostic evaluation.

### A treatment algorithm for high-tone pelvic floor dysfunction [^114hE4Hx]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain is estimated to affect one-quarter of women, costing more than $5.8 billion annually. High-tone pelvic floor disorder (HTPFD), characterized by tight, weakened, and/or painful pelvic floor muscles, is present in 60–90% of women with chronic pelvic pain. Muscle tension interferes with dynamic physiologic action, preventing appropriate pelvic floor coordination, contraction, and relaxation. High-tone pelvic floor dysfunction alone can cause pain and a wide range of genitourinary complaints, but can co-exist with other pelvic pain disorders. It frequently goes both unrecognized and untreated, contributing to poor outcomes.

High-tone pelvic floor dysfunction can be idiopathic or incited by poor toileting habits, visceral dysfunction (eg, endometriosis or interstitial cystitis or bladder pain syndrome), or musculoskeletal injuries (eg, sacroiliac joint dysfunction or hip osteoarthritis). Clinical identification of increased pelvic floor tone is subjective, relying on practitioner vaginal examination to identify hypertonicity pelvic floor muscles.

Beyond the diagnosis, there is little guidance on treatment pathways. While multiple studies have examined potential treatments for HTPFD, there is considerable variability in peer-reviewed evidence quality. Head-to-head studies of therapeutic approaches are lacking, making it challenging for many clinicians to determine treatment progression. Insufficient clinical guidance often leaves patients unable to access effective treatment or make informed decisions.

In the absence of guidelines or level I evidence, we sought to generate a treatment algorithm using the Delphi method, a formal, systematic qualitative methodology, to compile expert opinion statements supported by available literature pertinent to HTPFD.

### Prevalence of chronic pelvic pain by sexual orientation in a large cohort of young women in the United States [^113EgUob]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Sexual minority (lesbian, bisexual, mostly heterosexual) young women face many sexual and reproductive health disparities, but there is scant information on their experiences of chronic pelvic pain, including an absence of information on prevalence, treatment, and outcomes.

Aim

The purpose of this study was to describe the characteristics of chronic pelvic pain experiences of young women by sexual orientation identity and gender of sexual partners.

Methods

The analytical sample consisted of a nationwide sample of 6,150 U.S. young women (mean age = 23 years) from the Growing Up Today Study who completed cross-sectional questionnaires from 1996 to 2007.

Outcomes

Age-adjusted regression analyses were used to examine groups categorized by sexual orientation identity (completely heterosexual [ref.], mostly heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian) and gender of sexual partner (only men [ref.], no partners, both men, and women). We examined differences in lifetime and past-year chronic pelvic pain symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and quality of life outcomes. Sensitivity analyses also examined the role of pelvic/gynecologic exam history and hormonal contraceptive use as potential effect modifiers.

Results

Around half of all women reported ever experiencing chronic pelvic pain, among whom nearly 90% had past-year chronic pelvic pain. Compared to completely heterosexual women, there was greater risk of lifetime chronic pelvic pain among mostly heterosexual (risk ratio [RR] = 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.22–1.38), bisexual (RR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.10–1.52), and lesbian (RR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.00–1.52) young women. Additionally, compared to young women with only past male sexual partners, young women who had both men and women as past sexual partners were more likely to report chronic pelvic pain interfered with their social activities (b = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.25–1.02), work/school (b = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.17–0.93), and sex (b = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.05–1.00).

Clinical Implications

Healthcare providers, medical education, and field-wide standards of care should be attentive to the way sexual orientation-based healthcare disparities can manifest into differential prognosis and quality of life outcomes for women with chronic pelvic pain (particularly bisexual women).

Strengths & Limitations

Our study is the first to examine a variety of chronic pelvic pain outcomes in a nationwide U.S. sample across different outcomes (ie, past-year and lifetime). Though limited by sample homogeneity in terms of age, race, ethnicity, and gender, findings from this article provide foundational insights about chronic pelvic pain experiences of sexual minority young women.

Conclusion

Our key finding is that sexual minority women were commonly affected by chronic pelvic pain, and bisexual women face pain-related quality of life disparities. Tabaac AR, Chwa C, Sutter ME, et al.

### Anxiety and depression in women with and without chronic pelvic pain: prevalence and associated factors [^117WW9h6]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pain is a public health issue. However, the term chronic pain includes different types of pain such as chronic low back pain (CLBP) and chronic pelvic pain (CPP). These two distinct conditions merit particular mention in view of their negative repercussions on different areas of life. However, while CLBP consists of pain, muscle tension or stiffness below the costal margin and above the inferior gluteal folds, with or without leg pain (sciatica), persisting for more than three months, CPP in women can be described as noncyclic pain in the pelvic region persisting for at least six months, causing functional incapacity or requiring medical care. The prevalence of CPP in women varies across regions and countries. Prevalence rates of CPP have been reported as 19% in Brazil, 60.5% in China and 20% in the United States, with rates being higher in women of reproductive age.–

The etiology of CPP remains unclear; however, it appears to be multifactorial, involving both gynecological conditions and non-gynecological conditions such as those involving the digestive, urological, neurological and musculoskeletal systems. The cause of CPP remains unidentified in approximately half of the women affected. Furthermore, even when organic diseases are diagnosed, their finding appears to be rather incidental, with no epidemiological criteria pointing to the cause of pelvic pain.

CPP could possibly be a functional somatic syndrome, since both conditions share clinical similarities such as pain constituting the principal symptom, chronicity, absence of laboratory findings, being more common in women, worsening with stress and menstruation, and being associated with depression, anxiety and sexual and physical abuse. In addition, CPP represents an economic burden and may be associated with negative repercussions at work, in sexual functioning and mental health. These repercussions, taken together, may exert a negative effect on quality of life. Previous studies have shown an association between CPP in women and mood disorders and a history of physical and sexual abuse.

Chronic pelvic pain in men — evidence review methods detail data abstraction and risk-of-bias grading. For included studies, a single investigator abstracted study characteristics and results, with a second investigator reviewing for accuracy and discrepancies resolved through discussion and consensus. Two investigators independently assessed risk of bias using predefined criteria, with disagreements resolved by consensus, and studies were rated as "low risk of bias", "medium risk of bias", or "high risk of bias", with "low risk of bias" generally considered valid. "Low risk of bias" randomized trials include clear descriptions of the population, setting, interventions, and comparison groups, valid allocation methods, baseline similarity, low dropout with clear reporting, blinding of patients, care providers and outcome assessors, and appropriate analysis. "Low risk of bias" diagnostic accuracy studies use unbiased patient selection, avoid case-control design, clearly describe the test, apply the same reference standard to all patients, have low rates of missing or uninterpretable data, and ensure blinded interpretation of the reference standard. "Medium risk of bias" studies are susceptible to some bias and do not meet all "low risk of bias" criteria but have no flaw likely to cause major bias. "High risk of bias" studies have significant flaws that may invalidate results, and due to paucity of data in some areas were not excluded a priori but were considered less reliable than "low" or "medium risk of bias" studies. Criteria for assessing risk of bias were adapted from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and from the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) instrument.

### A systematic literature review on patient-reported outcome domains and measures in nonsurgical efficacy trials related to chronic pain associated with endometriosis: an urgent call to action [^116ZNJpy]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Endometriosis, affecting approximately 10% of women of reproductive age worldwide, is a chronic inflammatory disease of uncertain etiology and a common cause of chronic pelvic pain (CPP). The prevalence may be underestimated because symptoms are very heterogeneous and complex, and surgical confirmation is necessary for definitive diagnosis with severity of symptoms not being related to the extent or location of disease found at surgery. Hence, patients often face diagnostic delays of up to 7 to 9 years. Typical symptoms, such as chronic noncyclical pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and many other associations (including infertility), drastically affect physical and mental function, quality of life, as well as social and sexual well-being in the affected women. Treatment options, both medical and surgical, are often insufficient or even fail in up to 50% of patients. Ineffective treatment of chronic pain contributes to the burden of suffering for those affected.

### Irritable bowel syndrome and chronic pelvic pain: a population-based study [^111xwtR6]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Women with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) frequently report chronic pelvic pain, however, it is still unanswered whether these are truly separate entities. IBS negatively impacts on quality of life, but the impact of IBS on sexual function is not clear.

Goals

We aimed to (1) describe the impact of IBS on sexual function, and (2) evaluate the association between pelvic pain and IBS, and in particular identify if there are unique characteristics of the overlap group.

Study

The Talley Bowel Disease Questionnaire was mailed to an age- and gender-stratified random sample of 1031 Olmsted County, Minnesota residents aged 30 to 64 years. Manning (at least 2 of 6 positive) and Rome criteria (Rome I and modified Rome III) were used to identify IBS. Pelvic pain was assessed by a single item. Somatization was assessed by the valid somatic symptom checklist.

Results

Overall 648 (69%) of 935 eligible participants responded (mean age 52 years, 52% female). Self-reported sexual dysfunction was rare (0.9%; 95% CI 0.3–2.0%). Among women, 20% (95% CI 16–24%) reported pain in the pelvic region; 40% of those with pelvic pain met IBS by Manning, or Rome criteria. IBS and pelvic pain occurred together more commonly than expected by chance (P < 0.01). The overall somatization score (and specifically the depression and dizziness item scores) predicted IBS-pelvic pain overlap versus either IBS alone or pelvic pain alone.

Conclusion

In a subset with pelvic pain, there is likely to be a common underlying psychologic process (somatization) that explains the link to IBS.

### A meta-synthesis of qualitative literature on female chronic pelvic pain for the development of a core outcome set: a systematic review [^11711b32]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of chronic pelvic pain

This meta-theme encapsulates the frustrating journey of many women searching for a diagnosis and treatment for CPP. Over 85% of studies (7/8 studies) reported this meta-theme and comprised three subthemes including: "difficulty in reaching or a lack of a diagnosis", "lack of cure" and "the role of diagnostic tests" (Table S3). Women emphasized the importance of a diagnosis to exclude sinister pathology such as cancer, which was the source of anxiety among many women. There was a clear emphasis on objective evidence obtained from investigations by both participants and health professionals. A clear lack of knowledge was evident as investigations may not help diagnose CPP or the underlying cause itself. Negative investigations appeared to be damaging for women as these failed to legitimize their experience and attach a diagnosis to their symptoms. Furthermore, in light of negative investigations women were misdiagnosed with psychiatric disorders. A lack of diagnosis or cure resulted in women feeling alienated and disempowered with limited avenues of medical and social support to alleviate their CPP (Appendix S3).

There was moderate confidence in the evidence for this meta-theme. Seven studies with moderate methodological limitations contributed to this meta-theme (Table S4). Studies were conducted across three countries and 150 participants were recruited from a database acquired during a prevalence study, newspaper advertisements, and secondary and tertiary care hospitals.

Communication

This meta-theme was present in half of studies and refers to the interaction with health professionals and specifically focuses on how this influences the experience of women with CPP. Two subthemes, "consultation" and "advice and follow-up" contributed to the "communication" meta-theme (Table S3). Women described negative encounters in which health professionals appeared to be rushing through consultations, lacking in empathy and failing to recognize the severity or impact of symptoms. In some cases, this resulted in women withdrawing and disengaging from medical services and failing to seek advice. In comparison, a positive encounter eluded to a health professional that established a rapport by acknowledging a patient's experience as well as symptoms and utilized visual aids to assist clear communication. Furthermore, women expressed a lack of follow-up after procedures and advice following a diagnosis (Appendix S3).

There was high confidence in this evidence for this meta-theme. Four studies contributed to this meta-theme with minor methodological limitations (Table S4). Studies were conducted across one country and 87 participants were recruited from newspaper advertisements, secondary and tertiary care hospitals.

### Evaluation of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) on the management of female chronic pelvic pain (CPP) using the AGREE II instrument [^116UUKFd]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

In an era of patient-centred care, it was concerning that no guideline reported including women with CPP in the development process. Views and perceptions of women with CPP can be incorporated to frame the overarching theme of future guidelines as well as ensure the quality and relevance of recommendations. For example, all guidelines discussed the association of sexual abuse and CPP. However, no guideline specifically outlined recommendations pertaining to sexual abuse. Furthermore, no guideline reported women's experiences to support the use of recommended interventions. These insights are invaluable for policymakers and guideline developers. The identification of barriers and facilitators can influence the successful implementation of interventions. In this review, included guidelines may not have incorporated qualitative research findings because of a lack of primary qualitative studies exploring the experiences of women with CPP.

The detrimental impact of CPP on quality of life outcomes has been described and identified as a priority for women with CPP. Despite this, quality of life assessment is only reported by half of RCTs evaluating treatments for CPP. Our findings demonstrated that all guidelines referred to the measurement of quality of life; however, there was no recommendation regarding which measurement instrument to utilize. Our previous systematic review identified 17 quality of life measurement instruments; however, further research is required to assess the validity of such instruments in a CPP population.

There is an increased prevalence of sexual dysfunction observed in women with CPP compared with those without CPP (69.6% versus 30.4%). Underlying pelvic floor dysfunction including pelvic floor muscle overactivity and myofascial trigger points have been implicated in sexual disorders. Despite the impact of sexual dysfunction on the psychological and emotional well-being of women, we only identified two guidelines that recognized concurrent sexual dysfunction in women with CPP. The ACOG and EAU guideline recommended pelvic floor physiotherapy to improve quality of life and sexual function. Although there is increasing evidence to support the use of physiotherapy in CPP and sexual dysfunction, it remains underused in clinical practice.

Similarly, exercise has been successfully incorporated into multidisciplinary treatment programmes to treat female CPP. Available evidence suggests that physical activity/exercise as an intervention is associated with few adverse events and may improve pain intensity, physical function and consequently quality of life. However, our study demonstrated that only one guideline recommended the use of exercise in the management of CPP despite such benefits. Guideline developers need to incorporate multidisciplinary treatment modalities such as physiotherapy and exercise to maximize treatment benefits derived from conventional medical/surgical interventions.

### FIGO-IPPS consensus statement: addressing the global unmet needs of women with chronic pelvic pain [^117QZ1Bm]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

5 BARRIERS TO HEALTH‐RELATED CARE

The global health community needs to prioritize a move away from the current fragmented and often inadequate approach to CPP care. Transdisciplinary care using the biopsychosocial model, while recognized as the standard of care, remains inaccessible to most women. Admittedly, applying a biopsychosocial model to care for CPP patients can be complex and many of them experience delayed or inaccurate care due to limited access to specialists who have the proper knowledge to spearhead management strategies. For instance, women with endometriosis, a common subset of the CPP population, have reported delays of 4–11 years from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis. Disparities in access to quality care have been reported across LMICs and HICs, particularly for underserved populations. The resulting lack of recognition and access leaves women powerless and stigmatized, leading to the overuse of surgical interventions with irreversible consequences, such as menopause and infertility.

### Gabapentin for chronic pelvic pain in women (GaPP2): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1177tcB4]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Chronic pelvic pain affects 2–24% of women worldwide and evidence for medical treatments is scarce. Gabapentin is effective in treating some chronic pain conditions. We aimed to measure the efficacy and safety of gabapentin in women with chronic pelvic pain and no obvious pelvic pathology.

Methods

We performed a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial in 39 UK hospital centres. Eligible participants were women with chronic pelvic pain (with or without dysmenorrhoea or dyspareunia) of at least 3 months duration. Inclusion criteria were 18–50 years of age, use or willingness to use contraception to avoid pregnancy, and no obvious pelvic pathology at laparoscopy, which must have taken place at least 2 weeks before consent but less than 36 months previously. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive gabapentin (titrated to a maximum dose of 2700 mg daily) or matching placebo for 16 weeks. The online randomisation system minimised allocations by presence or absence of dysmenorrhoea, psychological distress, current use of hormonal contraceptives, and hospital centre. The appearance, route, and administration of the assigned intervention were identical in both groups. Patients, clinicians, and research staff were unaware of the trial group assignments throughout the trial. Participants were unmasked once they had provided all outcome data at week 16–17, or sooner if a serious adverse event requiring knowledge of the study drug occurred. The dual primary outcome measures were worst and average pain scores assessed separately on a numerical rating scale in weeks 13–16 after randomisation, in the intention-to-treat population. Self-reported adverse events were assessed according to intention-to-treat principles. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISCRTN77451762.

Findings

Participants were screened between Nov 30, 2015, and March 6, 2019, and 306 were randomly assigned (153 to gabapentin and 153 to placebo). There were no significant between-group differences in both worst and average numerical rating scale (NRS) pain scores at 13–16 weeks after randomisation. The mean worst NRS pain score was 7.1 (standard deviation [SD] 2.6) in the gabapentin group and 7.4 (SD 2.2) in the placebo group. Mean change from baseline was −1.4 (SD 2.3) in the gabapentin group and −1.2 (SD 2.1) in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference −0.20 [97.5% CI −0.81 to 0.42]; p = 0.47). The mean average NRS pain score was 4.3 (SD 2.3) in the gabapentin group and 4.5 (SD 2.2) in the placebo group. Mean change from baseline was −1.1 (SD 2.0) in the gabapentin group and −0.9 (SD 1.8) in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference −0.18 [97.5% CI −0.71 to 0.35]; p = 0.45). More women had a serious adverse event in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group (10 [7%] of 153 in the gabapentin group compared with 3 [2%] of 153 in the placebo group; p = 0.04). Dizziness, drowsiness, and visual disturbances were more common in the gabapentin group.

Interpretation

This study was adequately powered, but treatment with gabapentin did not result in significantly lower pain scores in women with chronic pelvic pain, and was associated with higher rates of side-effects than placebo. Given the increasing reports of abuse and evidence of potential harms associated with gabapentin use, it is important that clinicians consider alternative treatment options to off-label gabapentin for the management of chronic pelvic pain and no obvious pelvic pathology.

### Diagnostic laparoscopy guidelines: this guideline was prepared by the SAGES guidelines committee and reviewed and approved by the board of governors of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES), November 2007 [^115QZPJp]. Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic laparoscopy — indications, contraindications, risks, benefits, and diagnostic accuracy for chronic pelvic pain specify that the indication is chronic pelvic pain of unknown etiology after appropriate noninvasive workup. Contraindications include procedure intolerance and known dense pelvic adhesions that may make an accurate evaluation of pelvic pathology impossible or may impede safe abdominal access. Risks are procedure- or anesthesia-related complications. Benefits include potential identification of the source of the chronic pelvic pain, possibility for immediate therapeutic intervention, and potential improvement in the patient's quality of life. Diagnostic laparoscopy has been demonstrated to identify endometriosis, adhesions, or other abnormalities of the appendix and ovaries as the source of chronic pelvic pain.
